d33 coefficient in BiFeO3 ceramics. The measurements reveal considerable
piezoelectric nonlinearity, i.e., dependence of d33 on the amplitude of the
dynamic stress. The nonlinear response suggests a large irreversible
contribution of non-180{\deg} domain walls to the piezoelectric response of the
ferrite, which, at present measurement conditions, reached a maximum of 38% of
the total measured d33. In agreement with this interpretation, both types of
non-180{\deg} domain walls, characteristic for the rhombohedral BiFeO3, i.e.,
71{\deg} and 109{\deg}, were identified in the poled ceramics using
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In support to the link between
nonlinearity and non-180{\deg} domain wall contribution, we found a correlation
between nonlinearity and processes leading to deppining of domain walls from
defects, such as quenching from above the Curie temperature and
high-temperature sintering. In addition, the nonlinear piezoelectric response
of BiFeO3 showed a frequency dependence that is qualitatively different from
that measured in other nonlinear ferroelectric ceramics, such as ""soft""
(donor-doped) Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT); possible origins of this dispersion are
discussed. Finally, we show that, once released from pinning centers, the
domain walls can contribute extensively to the electromechanical response of
BiFeO3; in fact, the extrinsic domain-wall contribution is relatively as large
as in Pb-based ferroelectric ceramics with morphotropic phase boundary (MPB)
composition, such as PZT. This finding might be important in the search of new
lead-free MPB compositions based on BiFeO3 as it suggests that such
compositions might also exhibit large extrinsic domain-wall contribution to the
piezoelectric response.

Collaboration, Phys.Lett. B666,446, where several important results concerning
strange quark properties in the nucleon were presented. By analysing the sum of
K+- multiplicities it was found that the strange sea distribution is very
different from the non-strange one as a function of the Bjorken x scaling
variable. In addition, the magnitude of these two distributions at low x is
similar, contrary to the behaviour in most of the available parton distribution
function sets. It is shown that the obtained distribution of the unpolarised
strange quark influences our understanding of the ""strange quark polarisation
puzzle"". It is argued that the sole analysis of the sum of K+- multiplicities,
as done in the HERMES paper, might not be sufficient to draw solid conclusions
about the strange sector. A simultaneous analysis of the difference of K+-
multiplicities should be done in general. To show that this is not simply an
academic case, the author presents an analysis based on the HERMES preliminary
data, where the sum and the difference of the K+- multiplicities are
considered.

flows, the slip length increases almost linearly with shear rate. We found that
the velocity profiles in oscillatory flows are well described by the Stokes
flow solution with the slip length that depends on the local shear rate.
Interestingly, the rate dependence of the slip length obtained in steady shear

lead to very well conditioned optimization problems and therefore can be solved

advantageous features and one clear drawback: being the second-order approach
they need to solve linear equations and this operation has (in the general

specialize IPMs to sparse reconstruction problems and they have led to
interesting developments implemented in $\ell_1\_\ell_s$ and PDCO softwares. We
go a few steps further. First, we use the matrix-free interior point method, an
approach which redesigns IPM to avoid the need to explicitly formulate (and

of the signal processing matrices within the matrix-free IPM. Two such features
are of particular interest: an excellent conditioning of these matrices and the
ability to perform inexpensive (low complexity) matrix-vector multiplications
with them. Computational experience with large scale one-dimensional signals
confirms that the new approach is efficient and offers an attractive
alternative to other state-of-the-art solvers.

that account for the specific spatial distribution of dust that results from
consistent gas+dust dynamics. Methods: In a previous work, we ran full 3D,
two-fluid Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of a planet
embedded in a gas+dust T Tauri disk for different planet masses and grain
sizes. In this work, the resulting dust distributions are passed to the Monte
Carlo radiative transfer code MCFOST to construct synthetic images in the ALMA
wavebands. We then use the ALMA simulator to produce images that include
thermal and phase noise for a range of angular resolutions, wavelengths, and
integration times, as well as for different inclinations, declinations and
distances. We also produce images which assume that gas and dust are well mixed
with a gas-to-dust ratio of 100 to compare with previous ALMA predictions, all
made under this hypothesis. Results: Our findings clearly demonstrate the
importance of correctly incorporating the dust dynamics. We show that the gap
carved by a 1 M_J planet orbiting at 40 AU is visible with a much higher
contrast than the well-mixed assumption would predict. In the case of a 5 M_J
planet, we clearly see a deficit in dust emission in the inner disk, and point
out the risk of interpreting the resulting image as that of a transition disk
with an inner hole if observed in unfavorable conditions. Planet signatures are
fainter in more distant disks but declination or inclination to the
line-of-sight have little effect on ALMA's ability to resolve the gaps.
Conclusions: ALMA has the potential to see signposts of planets in disks of
nearby star-forming regions. We present optimized observing parameters to
detect them in the case of 1 and 5 M_J planets on 40 AU orbits.

community detection. The competitive position of the specializations is evident
in the average grades of the detected communities. The ratio of intercommunity
ties to intracommunity ties (conductance) quantifies the cooperative stance,

vertices in an undirected graph can be connected by $k$ pairwise edge-disjoint
paths if, and only if, after a deletion of any $k-1$ edges from the graph,
there will still will exist a path connecting these two vertices. We introduce
the notion of $k$-boundance of $(n-1)$-dimensional cycles in an $n$-dimensional
simplicial complex over $\mathbb{F}_2$, which is a generalization of the
classical notion of $k$-edge-connectivity in an undirected graph. For the case
$n=1$, $k$-boundance of $0$-dimensional cycles in an undirected graph is just
an extension of the classical notion of $k$-edge-connectivity of pairs of
vertices, stated in the language of cycles and boundaries. Using the notion of
$k$-boundance, we prove that a non-trivial $(n-1)$-dimensional cycle in an
$n$-dimensional simplicial complex over $\mathbb{F}_2$ is a boundary of $k$
pairwise disjoint $n$-dimensional chains if, and only if, after a deletion of
any $k-1$ $n$-dimensional simplices from that complex, there still remains some
$n$-dimensional chain in it, for which this $(n-1)$-dimensional cycle is a
boundary. In our last section we restate both the original Menger's Theorem and
our generalization to $k$-boundance in $n$ dimensions, in terms of the
underlying topological space. Thus, $k$-edge-connectivity of a pair of points
in an undirected graph is really a topological property of the corresponding
pair of points in the topological space, underlying that graph. Similarly,
$k$-boundance of an $(n-1)$-dimensional cycle is a topological property of the
topological subspace, underlying that $(n-1)$-dimensional cycle, in the
topological space, underlying the $n$-dimensional simplicial complex.

composed of two distinctive loop systems observed in EUV images. The UV 1600
\AA emission at the feet of these loops exhibits a rapid rise, followed by
enhanced emission in different EUV channels observed by AIA and EIS. Such
behavior is indicative of impulsive energy deposit and the subsequent response
in overlying coronal loops that evolve through different temperatures. Using
the method we recently developed, we infer empirical heating functions from the
rapid rise of the UV light curves for the two loop systems, respectively,
treating them as two big loops of cross-sectional area 5\arcsec by 5\arcsec,
and compute the plasma evolution in the loops using the EBTEL model (Klimchuk
et al. 2008). We compute the synthetic EUV light curves, which, with the
limitation of the model, reasonably agree with observed light curves obtained
in multiple AIA channels and EIS lines: they show the same evolution trend and
their magnitudes are comparable by within a factor of two. Furthermore, we also
compare the computed mean enthalpy flow velocity with the Doppler shift
measurements by EIS during the decay phase of the two loops. Our results
suggest that the two different loops with different heating functions as
inferred from their footpoint UV emission, combined with their different
lengths as measured from imaging observations, give rise to different coronal
plasma evolution patterns captured both in the model and observations.

For most existing privacy definitions, it is not clear what they actually
guarantee.
  In this paper, we propose the first (to the best of our knowledge) framework
for extracting semantic guarantees from privacy definitions. That is, instead
of answering narrow questions such as ""does privacy definition Y protect X?""
the goal is to answer the more general question ""what does privacy definition Y
protect?""
  The privacy guarantees we can extract are Bayesian in nature and deal with
changes in an attacker's beliefs. The key to our framework is an object we call
the row cone. Every privacy definition has a row cone, which is a convex set
that describes all the ways an attacker's prior beliefs can be turned into
posterior beliefs after observing an output of an algorithm satisfying that
privacy definition.
  The framework can be applied to privacy definitions or even to individual
algorithms to identify the types of inferences they defend against. We
illustrate the use of our framework with analyses of several definitions and
algorithms for which we can derive previously unknown semantics. These include
randomized response, FRAPP, and several algorithms that add integer-valued
noise to their inputs.

the volume of a wave chaotic cavity while leaving its shape intact. The sensors
work in the time domain by using either scattering fidelity of the transmitted
signals or time reversal mirrors. The sensors were tested experimentally by
inducing volume changing perturbations to a one cubic meter mixed chaotic and
regular billiard system. Perturbations which caused a volume change that is as
small as 54 parts in a million were quantitatively measured. These results were
obtained by using electromagnetic waves with a wavelength of about 5cm,
therefore, the sensor is sensitive to extreme sub-wavelength changes of the
boundaries of a cavity. The experimental results were compared with Finite
Difference Time Domain (FDTD) simulation results, and good agreement was found.
Furthermore, the sensor was tested using a frequency domain approach on a
numerical model of the star graph, which is a representative wave chaotic
system. These results open up interesting applications such as: monitoring the
spatial uniformity of the temperature of a homogeneous cavity during heating up
/ cooling down procedures, verifying the uniform displacement of a fluid inside
a wave chaotic cavity by another fluid, etc.

here presented. Our working hypothesis is that human actions lie on a union of

combinations of atoms from a learned dictionary representing the action's

action grouping, in this work only one single video segment is available for
both unsupervised learning and analysis without any prior training information.
After extracting simple features at a single spatio-temporal scale, we learn a
dictionary for each individual in the video during each short time lapse. These
dictionaries allow us to compare the individuals' actions by producing an
affinity matrix which contains sufficient discriminative information about the
actions in the scene leading to grouping with simple and efficient tools. With
diverse publicly available real videos, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the

have been a subject of controversies. Here, we determine its masses,
inclination, and the mass-loss rate using our derived relationship between the

either a neutron star or a black hole, but the latter only with a low mass.

the compact object is a black hole. Such a low-mass black-hole could be formed

expectation value of the fields, rather than into the parameters of the
Lagrangian, a new type of four-dimensional loop integral is introduced (the FDR
integral) which is independent of any UV regulator and respects all properties
required by gauge invariance. FDR reproduces the correct ABJ anomaly and no
change in the definition of gamma_5 is needed. With FDR the possibility is open
for an approach to UV infinities in which the renormalization program is
substituted by a simple reinterpretation of the appearing loop integrals as FDR
ones, leading to important consequences in the context of non-renormalizable
field theories. Finally, I show how FDR can also be used to regularize infrared

emission line galaxies in broadband optical UBVRI and near infra-red (NIR) HKs
filters. The sample comprises 19 blue compact galaxies (BCGs) and two spirals.
For some targets the exposure times are the deepest to date. For the BCG UM462
we observe a previously undetected second disk component beyond a surface
brightness level of mu_B=26 mag arcsec^{-2}. This is a true low surface
brightness component with central surface brightness mu_0=24.1 mag arcsec^{-2}
and scale length h_r=1.5 kpc. All BCGs are dwarfs, with M_B>=-18, and very
compact, with an average scale length of h_r~1 kpc. We separate the burst and
host populations for each galaxy and compare them to stellar evolutionary
models with and without nebular emission contribution. We also measure the
A_{180} asymmetry in all filters and detect a shift from optical to NIR in the
average asymmetry of the sample. This shift seems to be correlated with the
morphological class of the BCGs. Using the color-asymmetry relation, we
identify five BCGs in the sample as mergers, which is confirmed by their
morphological class. Though clearly separated from normal galaxies in the
concentration-asymmetry parameter space, we find that it is not possible to
distinguish luminous starbursting BCGs from the merely star forming low
luminosity BCGs.

interaction of a laser field and a fully stripped diatomic molecule in the
tunneling regime is presented. When the laser field is turned off, the Dirac
operator has resonances in both the positive and the negative energy continua
while bound states are in the mass gap. When this system is immersed in a
strong laser field, the resonances move in the complex energy plane: the
negative energy resonances are pushed to higher energies while the bound states
are Stark shifted. It is argued here that there is a pair production
enhancement at the crossing of resonances by looking at a simple 1-D model: the
nuclei are modeled simply by Dirac delta potential wells while the laser field
is assumed to be static and of finite spatial extent. The average rate for the
number of electron-positron pairs produced is evaluated and the results are
compared to the single nucleus and to the free cases. It is shown that
positrons are produced by the Resonantly Enhanced Pair Production (REPP)
mechanism, which is analogous to the resonantly enhanced ionization of
molecular physics. This phenomenon could be used to increase the number of
pairs produced at low field strength, allowing the study of the Dirac vacuum.

have been found recently in the high fidelity Kepler data for superoutbursts of
some members of the SU UMa subclass of dwarf novae. For the vast majority of
AAVSO data, the combination of low data cadence and large errors associated
with individual measurements precludes one from making any strong statement
about the shape of the long outbursts. However, for a small number of
outbursts, extensive long term monitoring with digital photometry yields high
fidelity light curves. We report the discovery of embedded precursors in two of
three candidate long outbursts. This is the first time that such embedded
precursors have been found in dwarf novae above the period gap, and reinforces
van Paradijs' finding that long outbursts in dwarf novae above the period gap
and superoutbursts in systems below the period gap constitute a unified class.
The thermal-tidal instability to account for superoutbursts in the SU UMa stars
predicts embedded precursors only for short orbital period dwarf novae,
therefore the presence of embedded precursors in long orbital period systems -
U Gem and SS Cyg - argues for a more general mechanism to explain long
outbursts.

show that the assumption of a point-like source leads, for a simple Hamiltonian

show that an appropriate consideration of these singular terms solves an
apparent inconsistency between the total field energy and the space integral of

an important contribution to the self-energy of the source. We then consider
the case of an extended source, smeared out over a finite volume and described
by an appropriate form factor. We show that in this case all divergences in

between production rates and visual magnitudes observed for a sample of comets

diffuse Galactic emission, roughly centered on the Galactic centre, and extends
to |b| ~35 deg in Galactic latitude and |l| ~15 deg in longitude. By combining
the Planck data with observations from the WMAP we are able to determine the
spectrum of this emission to high accuracy, unhindered by the large systematic
biases present in previous analyses. The derived spectrum is consistent with
power-law emission with a spectral index of -2.55 +/- 0.05, thus excluding
free-free emission as the source and instead favouring hard-spectrum
synchrotron radiation from an electron population with a spectrum (number
density per energy) dN/dE ~ E^-2.1. At Galactic latitudes |b|<30 deg, the
microwave haze morphology is consistent with that of the Fermi gamma-ray ""haze""

component of our Galaxy. Given both the very hard spectrum and the extended
nature of the emission, it is highly unlikely that the haze electrons result

first two families. In this case, it is possible to have a significant
correction to the anomalous magnetic moment of muon. A three family IeffSUSY in
a Z' mediation scenario is explicitly studied with the Z' quantum number
related to B-L. Here, we adopt both the Z' mediation and gravity mediation
where the Z' mediation is the dominant one for stop, while the gravity
mediation is the dominant one for the muonic leptons and Higgs multiplets. We
present a numerical study based on a specific anomaly free model, and show the
existence of the parameter region where all the phenomenological conditions are
satisfied.

formation of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS). As the HMNS loses thermal
pressure due to neutrino cooling and/or centrifugal support due to
gravitational wave (GW) emission, and/or magnetic breaking of differential
rotation it will collapse to a black hole. To assess the importance of
shock-induced thermal pressure and cooling, we adopt an idealized equation of
state and perform NSNS simulations in full GR through late inspiral, merger,
and HMNS formation, accounting for cooling. We show that thermal pressure
contributes significantly to the support of the HMNS against collapse and that
thermal cooling accelerates its ""delayed"" collapse. Our simulations demonstrate
explicitly that cooling can induce the catastrophic collapse of a hot
hypermassive neutron star formed following the merger of binary neutron stars.
Thus, cooling physics is important to include in NSNS merger calculations to
accurately determine the lifetime of the HMNS remnant and to extract
information about the NS equation of state, cooling mechanisms, bar
instabilities and B-fields from the GWs emitted during the transient phase
prior to BH formation.

the waveform phase is a monotonic function of grid resolution, we find that the

induced by grid refinement boundaries. Our results seem to indicate that one
can obtain gravitational waveform phases to within 0.05 rad. (and possibly as
small as 0.015 rad.), while the amplitude error can be reduced to 0.1%. We then

is accompanied by a change in spectral class from K6/K7 (the spectral class of

heavy-ion collisions at the energies of RHIC show that it is of the same order
as the hadronic one. This finding appears to contradict the expected dominance
of photon production from a quark-gluon plasma at an early stage of a heavy-ion
collision. A possible explanation of the strong azimuthal anisotropy of the
photons, given recently, is based on the presence of a large magnetic field in
the early phase of a collision. In this letter, we propose a method to
experimentally measure the degree to which a magnetic field in heavy-ion
collisions is responsible for the observed anisotropy of photon production. The
experimental test proposed in this letter may potentially change our
understanding of the non-equilibrium stage and possible thermalization in
heavy-ion collisions.

not violate Bell's inequalities, being in this sense local. Here we show that
such a local character of quantum correlations is in fact general for
translation invariant systems and has its origins in the monogamy trade-off
obeyed by tripartite Bell correlations. We illustrate this result in a quantum
spin chain with a soft breaking of translation symmetry. In addition, we extend
the monogamy inequality to the $N$-qubit scenario, showing that the bound
increases with $N$ and providing examples of its saturation through uniformly

models of gas accretion onto high mass cores (15-33 Earth masses) over hundreds

mass of gas, before eventually undergoing a hydrodynamic collapse. This
collapse causes the density near the core to increase by more than an order of
magnitude, and the outer envelope to evolve into a circumplanetary disc. A
small reduction in the mass within the Hill radius (R_H) accompanies this
collapse as a shock propagates outwards. This collapse leads to a new
hydrostatic equilibrium for the protoplanetary envelope, at which point 97 per
cent of the mass contained within the Hill radius is within the inner 0.03 R_H
which had previously contained less than 40 per cent. Following this collapse
the protoplanet resumes accretion at its prior rate. The net flow of mass
towards this dense protoplanet is predominantly from high latitudes, whilst at
the outer edge of the circumplanetary disc there is net outflow of gas along
the midplane. We also find a turnover of gas deep within the bound envelope

out in the frequency range 480-1907 GHz, and auxiliary interferometric data
from the SMA in the 230 GHz band provide spatial information for disentangling
the different physical components contributing to the HIFI spectrum. The
spectral lines are identified with the aid of former surveys and spectral line
catalogs. The observed spectrum is then compared to a simulated synthetic
spectrum with XCLASS, assuming local thermal equilibrium, and best fit
parameters are derived using the model optimization package MAGIX. A total of
46 molecules are identified, with 31 isotopologues, resulting in about 4300
emission and absorption lines. High- energy levels of the dominant emitter
methanol and vibrationally excited HCN are detected. The number of unidentified
lines remains low with 75, or less than 2 percent of the lines detected. The
modeling suggests that several spectral features need two or more components to
be fitted properly. Other components could be assigned to cold foreground
clouds or to outflows, most visible in the SiO emission. A chemical variation
between the two embedded hot cores is found, with more N-bearing molecules
identified in SMA1 and O-bearing molecules in SMA2. Spectral line surveys give
powerful insights into the study of the interstellar medium. Different
molecules trace different physical conditions like the inner hot core, the
envelope, the outflows or the cold foreground clouds. The derived molecular
abundances provide further constraints for astrochemical models.

and a 350 micron detection give a minimum bolometric luminosity of 3.7 x 10^13
Lsun, with ~10^14 Lsun plausible. Followup images reveal four nearby sources: a
QSO and two Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z = 2.45, and an M dwarf star. The
brighter LBG dominates the bolometric emission. Gravitational lensing is
unlikely given the source locations and their different spectra and colors. The
dominant LBG spectrum indicates a star formation rate ~300 Msun/yr, accounting
for < 10% of the bolometric luminosity. Strong 22 micron emission relative to
350 microns implies that warm dust contributes significantly to the luminosity,
while cooler dust normally associated with starbursts is constrained by an
upper limit at 1.1 mm. Radio emission is ~10x above the far-infrared/radio
correlation, indicating an active galactic nucleus is present. An obscured AGN
combined with starburst and evolved stellar components can account for the
observations. If the black hole mass follows the local M_BH-bulge mass
relation, the implied Eddington ratio is >~4. WISE 1814+3412 may be a heavily

significantly higher mid-IR to submm ratios than other galaxy templates,
suggesting a hotter dust temperature. We estimate their dust temperatures to be
60-120 K using a single-temperature model. Their infrared luminosities are well
over 10^{13} Lsun. These SEDs are not well fitted with existing galaxy
templates, suggesting they are a new population with very high luminosity and
hot dust. They are likely among the most luminous galaxies in the Universe. We
argue that they are extreme cases of luminous, hot dust-obscured galaxies

  arXiv:1112.3111. To appear in Mathematical Finance",,,,"q-fin.PR math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present work, a novel second-order approximation for ATM option prices
is derived for a large class of exponential L\'{e}vy models with or without
Brownian component. The results hereafter shed new light on the connection
between both the volatility of the continuous component and the jump parameters
and the behavior of ATM option prices near expiration. In the presence of a
Brownian component, the second-order term, in time-$t$, is of the form
$d_{2}\,t^{(3-Y)/2}$, with $d_{2}$ only depending on $Y$, the degree of jump
activity, on $\sigma$, the volatility of the continuous component, and on an
additional parameter controlling the intensity of the ""small"" jumps (regardless
of their signs). This extends the well known result that the leading
first-order term is $\sigma t^{1/2}/\sqrt{2\pi}$. In contrast, under a
pure-jump model, the dependence on $Y$ and on the separate intensities of
negative and positive small jumps are already reflected in the leading term,
which is of the form $d_{1}t^{1/Y}$. The second-order term is shown to be of
the form $\tilde{d}_{2} t$ and, therefore, its order of decay turns out to be
independent of $Y$. The asymptotic behavior of the corresponding Black-Scholes
implied volatilities is also addressed. Our approach is sufficiently general to
cover a wide class of L\'{e}vy processes which satisfy the latter property and
whose L\'{e}vy densitiy can be closely approximated by a stable density near
the origin. Our numerical results show that the first-order term typically
exhibits rather poor performance and that the second-order term can
significantly improve the approximation's accuracy, particularly in the absence
of a Brownian component.

ideal as a random survey of galaxies, as well as the availability of a wide
variety of ancillary observations to support the spectroscopic results. Using
the PEARS data we are able to identify star forming galaxies within the
redshift volume 0< z<1.5. Star forming regions in the PEARS survey are
pinpointed independently of the host galaxy. This method allows us to detect
the presence of multiple emission line regions (ELRs) within a single galaxy.

sample of ~906 galaxies down to a limiting flux of ~1e-18 erg/s/cm^2. The ELRs
have also been compared to the properties of the host galaxy, including
morphology, luminosity, and mass. From this analysis we find three key results:
1) The computed line luminosities show evidence of a flattening in the
luminosity function with increasing redshift; 2) The star forming systems show
evidence of disturbed morphologies, with star formation occurring predominantly
within one effective (half-light) radius. However, the morphologies show no
correlation with host stellar mass; and 3) The number density of star forming

metal shell is a bowl-shaped frame, its walls composed of densely packed
nanoelements. Each nanoelement is a conical bundle of nanowires grown as a
supported wine glass. The shell inner surface is a weave of nanowires with a
vegetation pattern with bottom up directed lines. The inner surface exhibits
also well pronounced transverse rings formed by the bottom up growing bundles
of nanowires that compose the shell frame. A number of nanowire bundle ends
rise to the shell outer surface as nanoflowers that can serve as templates for
growing nanowires. In some cases the nanowires growing on the outer surface
form a copy of plate mushroom. A hypothesis is proposed that pulsed growth on

queues with impatient customers within a general framework of scaling customer
patience time. The approach consists of two steps. The first step is to show
that the diffusion-scaled abandonment process is asymptotically close to a
function of the diffusion-scaled queue length process under appropriate
conditions. The second step is to construct a continuous mapping not only to
characterize the system dynamics using the system primitives, but also to help
verify the conditions needed in the first step. The diffusion approximations
can then be obtained by applying the continuous mapping theorem. The approach
has two advantages: (i) it provides a unified procedure to establish the
diffusion approximations regardless of the structure of the queueing model or
the type of patience-time scaling; (ii) and it makes the diffusion analysis of
queues with customer abandonment essentially the same as the diffusion analysis
of queues without customer abandonment. We demonstrate the application of this
approach via the single server system with Markov-modulated service speeds in
the traditional heavy-traffic regime and the many-server system in the

yields charged leptons with negative helicity (positive for $\pi^+,K^+$). We
obtain the branching ratio for this process and argue that a Stern-Gerlach
filter leads to spatially separated domains of both helicity components with
abundances determined by the branching ratio. Complemented with a search of
monochromatic peaks, this setup can yield both the mass and mixing angles for
sterile neutrinos with masses in the range $3 MeV \lesssim m_s \lesssim 414
MeV$ in next generation high intensity experiments. We also study oscillations
of light Dirac and Majorana sterile neutrinos with $m_s \simeq eV$ produced in
meson decays including decoherence aspects arising from lifetime effects of the
decaying mesons and the stopping distance of the charged lepton in short
baseline experiments. We obtain the transition probability from production to
detection via charged current interactions including these decoherence effects
for 3+1 and 3+2 scenarios, also studying $|\Delta L|=2$ transitions from
$\bar{\nu} \leftrightarrow \nu$ oscillations for Majorana neutrinos and the
impact of these effects on the determination of CP-violating amplitudes. We
argue that decoherence effects are important in current short baseline
accelerator experiments, leading to an underestimate of masses, mixing and
CP-violating angles. At MiniBooNE/SciBooNE we estimate that these effects lead
to an $\sim 15%$ underestimate for sterile neutrino masses $m_s \gtrsim 3

stopping the charged leptons on distances much smaller than the decay length of

selection of optically pumped atoms because of their specific transit time and
collisional relaxation in such a cell, which lead to narrow sub-Doppler
resonances in absorption of the probe monochromatic light beam. Resolution of
this spectroscopic method is analyzed in cases of stationary and definite
nonstationary optical pumping of atoms by the broadband radiation versus
geometrical parameters of given cells and pumping intensity. The suggested

  In this note, we show how to endow each Harder-Narasimhan stratum with the

of observables computed along orbits generated by random transformations. The
underlying, deterministic, dynamical system can be regular or chaotic. In the
former case, we will show that by perturbing rational or irrational rotations
with additive noise, an extreme value law appears, regardless of the intensity
of the noise, while unperturbed rotations do not admit such limiting
distributions. In the case of deterministic chaotic dynamics, we will consider
observables specially designed to study the recurrence properties in the
neighbourhood of periodic points. Hence, the exponential limiting law for the
distribution of maxima is modified by the presence of the extremal index, a
positive parameter not larger than one, whose inverse gives the average size of
the clusters of extreme events. The theory predicts that such a parameter is
unitary when the system is perturbed randomly. We perform sophisticated
numerical tests to assess how strong is the impact of noise level, when finite
time series are considered. We find agreement with the asymptotic theoretical
results but also non-trivial behaviour in the finite range. In particular our
results suggest that in many applications where finite datasets can be produced

accelerate algorithms to solve systems of equations. In this paper, we
demonstrate how preconditioning can circumvent a stringent assumption for sign
consistency in sparse linear regression. Given $X \in R^{n \times p}$ and $Y
\in R^n$ that satisfy the standard regression equation, this paper demonstrates
that even if the design matrix $X$ does not satisfy the irrepresentable
condition for the Lasso, the design matrix $F X$ often does, where $F \in
R^{n\times n}$ is a preconditioning matrix defined in this paper. By computing
the Lasso on $(F X, F Y)$, instead of on $(X, Y)$, the necessary assumptions on
$X$ become much less stringent.
  Our preconditioner $F$ ensures that the singular values of the design matrix
are either zero or one. When $n\ge p$, the columns of $F X$ are orthogonal and
the preconditioner always circumvents the stringent assumptions. When $p\ge n$,
$F$ projects the design matrix onto the Stiefel manifold; the rows of $F X$ are
orthogonal. We give both theoretical results and simulation results to show
that, in the high dimensional case, the preconditioner helps to circumvent the
stringent assumptions, improving the statistical performance of a broad class

cooling rate. At lower cooling rate (1{\deg}C/min), products of eutectic
crystallization form layer on the cell surface which thickness varies for
different cells and can reach ~1 {\mu}m in thickness. At higher cooling rate

to be less than ~20 nm. These experimental results are consistent with

based on topographic data from the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), using
three independent tools. Risk assessment of the identified sites is also being
performed through independent studies. Long baseline slopes are assessed based
on LOLA, while craters and boulders are detected both visually and using
computer tools in Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) images, down to a
size of less than 2 m, and size-frequency distributions are generated. Shadow
hazards are also assessed via LROC images. The preliminary results show that
areas with quasi-continuous illumination of several months exist, but their
size is small (few hundred metres); the duration of the illumination period
drops quickly to less than one month outside the areas, and some areas present
gaps with short illumination periods. Concerning hazard distributions, 50 m
slopes are found to be shallow (few degrees) based on LOLA, whereas at the
scale of the lander footprint (~5 m) they are mostly dominated by craters,
expected to be mature (from geological context) and shallow (~11{\deg}). The
preliminary conclusion is that the environment at the prospective landing sites
is within the capabilities of the Lander design.

surveys, based on semi-analytic models applied to cosmological N-body
simulations. The ASKAP HI All-Sky Survey, known as WALLABY, is a shallow 3 Pi
survey (z = 0 - 0.26) which will probe the mass and dynamics of over 600,000
galaxies. A much deeper small-area HI survey, called DINGO, aims to trace the
evolution of HI from z = 0 - 0.43, a cosmological volume of 40 million Mpc^3,
detecting potentially 100,000 galaxies. The high-sensitivity 30 antenna ASKAP
core (diameter ~2 km) will provide an angular resolution of 30 arcsec (at z=0).
Our simulations show that the majority of galaxies detected in WALLABY (87.5%)
will be resolved. About 5000 galaxies will be well resolved, i.e. more than
five beams (2.5 arcmin) across the major axis, enabling kinematic studies of
their gaseous disks. This number would rise to 160,000 galaxies if all 36 ASKAP
antennas could be used; the additional six antennas provide baselines up to 6
km, resulting in an angular resolution of 10 arcsec. For DINGO this increased
resolution is highly desirable to minimise source confusion; reducing confusion
rates from a maximum of 10% of sources at the survey edge to 3%. We estimate
that the sources detected by WALLABY and DINGO will span four orders of
magnitude in total halo mass (from 10^{11} to 10^{15} Msol) and nearly seven
orders of magnitude in stellar mass (from 10^{5} to 10^{12} Msol), allowing us
to investigate the process of galaxy formation across the last four billion
years.

random subsampling. For problems with only continuous predictors simple random
subsampling is a reliable method to generate initial coefficient estimates that
can then be further refined. For data with categorical predictors, however,
random subsampling often does not work, thus limiting the use of an otherwise
fine estimator. This also makes the choice of estimator for robust linear
regression dependent on the type of predictors, which is an unnecessary
nuisance in practice. For data with categorical predictors random subsampling
often generates singular subsamples. Since these subsamples cannot be used to
calculate coefficient estimates, they have to be discarded. This makes random
subsampling slow, especially if some levels of categorical predictors have low
frequency, and renders the algorithms infeasible for such problems. This paper
introduces an improved subsampling algorithm that only generates nonsingular
subsamples. We call it nonsingular subsampling. For data with continuous
variables it is as fast as simple random subsampling but much faster for data
with categorical predictors. This is achieved by using a modified LU
decomposition algorithm that combines the generation of a sample and the
solving of the least squares problem.

light curves with extrinsic variability. These methods share a common
formalism, which enables them to process data from n-image lenses. Since the
estimators rely on significantly contrasting ideas, we expect them to be
sensitive to different bias sources. For each method and data set, we
empirically estimate both the precision and accuracy (bias) of the time delay
measurement using simulated light curves with known time delays that closely
mimic the observations. Finally, we test the self-consistency of our approach,
and we demonstrate that our bias estimation is serviceable. These new methods,
including the empirical uncertainty estimator, will represent the standard

iterative importance sampling approach. An important drawback of this
methodology is the degeneracy of the importance weights when the dimension of
either the observations or the variables of interest is high. To alleviate this
difficulty, we propose a novel method that performs a nonlinear transformation
on the importance weights. This operation reduces the weight variation, hence
it avoids their degeneracy and increases the efficiency of the importance
sampling scheme, specially when drawing from a proposal functions which are
poorly adapted to the true posterior.
  For the sake of illustration, we have applied the proposed algorithm to the
estimation of the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. This is a very simple
problem that enables us to clearly show and discuss the main features of the
proposed technique. As a practical application, we have also considered the
popular (and challenging) problem of estimating the rate parameters of
stochastic kinetic models (SKM). SKMs are highly multivariate systems that
model molecular interactions in biological and chemical problems. We introduce
a particularization of the proposed algorithm to SKMs and present numerical
results.

parameter families of strict contractions induced, through Kubo-Ando theory of

indeed geodesics of affinely connected manifolds, thereby providing the cases
when these generalized Karcher equations are exactly Karcher equations in the

unique solutions of these generalized Karcher equations are called lambda

its capability to produce quantum discord, and analyze in detail the generation
of discord by relevant classes of two-qubit gates. Our measure is based on the
Cartan decomposition of two-qubit unitaries and on evaluating the maximum
discord achievable by a unitary upon acting on classical-classical states at
fixed purity. We found that there exist gates which are perfect discorders for
any value of purity, and that they belong to a class of operators that includes
the $\sqrt{{SWAP}}. Other gates, even those universal for quantum computation,
do not posses the same property: the CNOT, for example, is a perfect discorder
only for states with low or unit purity, but not for intermediate values. The
discording power of a two-qubit unitary also provides a generalization of the
corresponding measure defined for entanglement to any value of the purity.

The secondary users accept the unreceived primary packets with a certain
probability and transmit randomly from either of their queues if both are
nonempty. These probabilities are optimized to expand the maximum stable
throughput region of the system. Moreover, we suggest a secondary multiple
access scheme in which one secondary user senses the channel for $\tau$ seconds
from the beginning of the time slot and transmits if the channel is found to be
free. The other secondary user senses the channel over the period $[0,2\tau]$
to detect the possible activity of the primary user and the first-ranked
secondary user. It transmits, if possible, starting after $2\tau$ seconds from
the beginning of the time slot. It compensates for the delayed transmission by
increasing its transmission rate so that it still transmits one packet during

ensure message delivery in the presence of up to f Byzantine nodes. The
question of how these paths are identified is related to the fundamental
problem of topology discovery. Distributed algorithms for topology discovery
cope with a never ending task, dealing with frequent changes in the network
topology and unpredictable transient faults. Therefore, algorithms for topology
discovery should be self-stabilizing to ensure convergence of the topology
information following any such unpredictable sequence of events. We present the
first such algorithm that can cope with Byzantine nodes. Starting in an
arbitrary global state, and in the presence of f Byzantine nodes, each node is
eventually aware of all the other non-Byzantine nodes and their connecting
communication links. Using the topology information, nodes can, for example,
route messages across the network and deliver messages from one end user to
another. We present the first deterministic, cryptographicassumptions- free,
self-stabilizing, Byzantine-resilient algorithms for network topology discovery
and end-to-end message delivery. We also consider the task of r-neighborhood
discovery for the case in which r and the degree of nodes are bounded by
constants. The use of r-neighborhood discovery facilitates polynomial time,
communication and space solutions for the above tasks. The obtained algorithms
can be used to authenticate parties, in particular during the establishment of
private secrets, thus forming public key schemes that are resistant to
man-in-the-middle attacks of the compromised Byzantine nodes. A polynomial and
efficient end-to-end algorithm that is based on the established private secrets
can be employed in between periodical re-establishments of the secrets.

stability of 10^-14 with a miniature clock that consumes only 50 mW of power
and occupies a volume of 5 cm^3. I discuss our progress over several years of
work on this project. We began by building a conventional tabletop clock to use
as a test bed while developing several designs of miniature ion-trap vacuum
packages, while also developing techniques for various aspects of the clock
operation, including ion loading, laser and magnetic field stabilization, and a
low power ion trap drive. The ion traps were modeled using boundary element
software to assist with the design and parameter optimization of new trap
geometries. We expect a novel trap geometry that uses a material new to ion
traps to lead to an exceptionally small ion trap vacuum package in the next
phase of the project. To achieve the long-term stability required, we have also
considered the sensitivity of the clock frequency to magnetic fields. A study
of the motion of the individual ions in a room-temperature cloud in the trap
was performed with the purpose of understanding the effect of both spatially
varying and constant magnetic fields on the clock resonance and therefore the
operation of the clock. These effects were studied experimentally and
theoretically for several traps. In summary, this dissertation is a
contribution to the design, development, and testing of a 171Yb+ ion cloud
frequency standard and related techniques, including analyses of trap
geometries and parameters, modeling of the ion motion, and the practical

opening of additional nonradiative channels through thermal activation to
higher energy states predominantly and indicates a near-unity quantum

CMFV and in a minimal version of U(2)^3 models, MU(2)^3, where only the minimal
set of spurions for breaking the symmetry is used and where only SM operators
are relevant. Due to the different treatment of the third generation MU(2)^3
models avoid the Delta M_{s,d}-|epsilon_K| correlation of CMFV which precludes
to solve the S_{psi K_S}- |epsilon_K| tension present in the flavour data.
While the flavour structure in K meson system is the same for CMFV and MU(2)^3

We point out a triple correlation between S_{psi phi}, S_{psi K_S} and |V_{ub}|
that can provide a distinction between different MU(2)^3 models. GUTs open the
possibility to transfer the neutrino mixing matrix U_{PMNS} to the quark sector
which leads to correlations between leptonic and hadronic observables. This is
accomplished in a controlled way in an SO(10) SUSY GUT model proposed by Chang,
Masiero and Murayama (CMM model) whose flavour structure differ significantly
from the constrained MSSM. We present a summary of a global analysis of several
flavour processes containing B_s-overline{B}_s mixing, b -> s gamma and tau ->
mu gamma. Furthermore we comment on the implications on the model due to the

elements of Bohmian mechanics and of Everett's ""many-worlds"" interpretation.
The resulting theory has the advantage of resolving known issues of both
theories, as well as those of standard quantum mechanics. It has a clear
ontology and a set of precisely defined postulates from where the predictions
of standard quantum mechanics can be derived. Most importantly, the Born rule
can be derived by straightforward application of the Laplacian rule, without
reliance on a ""quantum equilibrium hypothesis"" that is crucial for Bohmian
mechanics, and without reliance on a ""branch weight"" that is crucial for
Everett-type theories. The theory describes a continuum of worlds rather than a
single world or a discrete set of worlds, so it is similar in spirit to
many-worlds interpretations based on Everett's approach, without being actually
reducible to these. In particular, there is no ""splitting of worlds"", which is
a typical feature of Everett-type theories. Altogether, the theory explains 1)
the subjective occurrence of probabilities, 2) their quantitative value as
given by the Born rule, 3) the identification of observables as self-adjoint
operators on Hilbert space, and 4) the apparently random ""collapse of the
wavefunction"" caused by the measurement, while still being an objectively
deterministic theory.

any matroid $S\subset\{0,1\}^n$ by any binary $d\times n$ matrix $W$ is $m(d)$

against the dust-scattering origin of the diffuse H-alpha emission (including

studies on the diffuse H-alpha emission. In this paper, we reexamine the
arguments against dust scattering and find that the dust-scattering origin of
the diffuse H-alpha emission cannot be ruled out. As opposed to the previous
contention, the expected dust- scattered H-alpha halos surrounding H II regions
are, in fact, in good agreement with the observed H-alpha morphology. We
calculate an extensive set of photoionization models by varying elemental

of identifying switching transitions between these filled states. We find that
order-electric coupling between the fluid and the field provides a means of
switching between states where the plateaux between grooves are dry and states
where they are wet by a nematic layer, without affecting the configuration of
the nematic within the groove. We find that flexoelectric coupling may change
the nematic texture in the groove, provided that the flexoelectric coupling
differentiates between the types of distortion at the corners of the substrate.
We identify intermediate stages of the transitions, and the role played by the
motion of the nematic-isotropic interface. We determine quantitatively the
field magnitudes and orientations required to effect each type of transition.

transfer phenomena as well as processes of continuum mechanics. To handle flows
in porous media, the fundamental issue is to model correctly the convective
transport of individual phases. Moreover, for compressible media, the pressure
equation itself is just a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation.
  For different problems, a convection-diffusion equation may be be written in
various forms. The most popular formulation of convective transport employs the
divergent (conservative) form. In some cases, the nondivergent (characteristic)
form seems to be preferable. The so-called skew-symmetric form of convective
transport operators that is the half-sum of the operators in the divergent and
nondivergent forms is of great interest in some applications.
  Here we discuss the basic classes of discretization in space: finite
difference schemes on rectangular grids, approximations on general polyhedra
(the finite volume method), and finite element procedures. The key properties
of discrete operators are studied for convective and diffusive transport. We
emphasize the problems of constructing approximations for convection and
diffusion operators that satisfy the maximum principle at the discrete level
--- they are called monotone approximations.
  Two- and three-level schemes are investigated for transient problems.
Unconditionally stable explicit-implicit schemes are developed for
convection-diffusion problems. Stability conditions are obtained both in
finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and in Banach spaces depending on the form in
which the convection-diffusion equation is written.

is a very useful tool in the theoretical analysis of coherent systems.
  It was shown in two independent recent papers how the structural signature of

discussed at large Nc. The energy is compared for the hedgehog, conventional,

non-perturbative levels. In perturbative estimates, we take into account the
pion exchanges among quarks up to the third orders of axial charge vertices,
including the many-body forces such as the Wess-Zumino terms. It turns out that
the perturbative pion exchanges among valence quarks give the same leading Nc
contributions for three wavefunctions, while their mass differences are
O(Lamba_qcd). The signs of splittings flip for different orders of the axial
charge vertices, so it is hard to conclude which one is the most energetically
favored. For non-perturbative estimates involving the modification of quark
bases, we use the chiral quark soliton model as an illustration. With the
hedgehog quark wavefunctions with gA of O(Nc), we investigate whether solutions
with coherent pions are energetically favored. Again it is hard to give
decisive conclusions, but it is likely that adding the confining effects
disfavors the solution with the coherent pions, making a pion cloud around a
nucleon quantum rather than coherent. The nuclear matter at large Nc is also

Moreover, in the diffusion layer, nitrogen is found to be dispersed in the

Hardness tests show that the material hardness increases linearly with the

understanding the emergence and equilibration of jets from the turbulence in
planetary atmospheres based on the dynamics of the statistical mean state of
the turbulence closed at second order. Predictions for formation and
equilibration of turbulent jets made using S3T are critically compared with
results of simulations made using the associated quasi-linear and nonlinear
models. S3T predicts the observed bifurcation behavior associated with the
emergence of jets, their equilibration and their breakdown as a function of
parameters. Quantitative differences in bifurcation parameter values between
predictions of S3T and results of nonlinear simulations are traced to
modification of the eddy spectrum which results from two processes: nonlinear
eddy-eddy interactions and formation of discrete non-zonal structures.
Remarkably, these non-zonal structures, which substantially modify the
turbulence spectrum, are found to arise from S3T instability. Formation as
linear instabilities and equilibration at finite amplitude of multiple
equilibria for identical parameter values in the form of jets with distinct
meridional wavenumbers is verified as is the existence at equilibrium of finite
amplitude non-zonal structures in the form of nonlinearly modified Rossby
waves. When zonal jets and nonlinearly modified Rossby waves coexist at finite
amplitude the jet structure is generally found to dominate even if it is
linearly less unstable. The physical reality of the manifold of S3T jets and
non-zonal structures is underscored by the existence in nonlinear simulations
of jet structure at subcritical S3T parameter values which are identified with
stable S3T jet modes excited by turbulent fluctuations.

$\delta(G)$, this gives the best known estimate to a recent question of Wang.
Since one obviously needs at least $2\delta(G)$ vertices to guarantee a rainbow
matching of size $\delta(G)$, we investigate what happens when $|V(G)|\ge
2\delta(G)$. We show that any properly edge colored graph $G$ with $|V(G)|\ge
2\delta$ contains a rainbow matching of size at least $\delta -
2\delta(G)^{2/3}$. This result extends (with a weaker error term) the
well-known result that a factorization of the complete bipartite graph
$K_{n,n}$ has a rainbow matching of size $n-o(n)$, or equivalently that every
Latin square of order $n$ has a partial transversal of size $n-o(n)$ (an
asymptotic version of the Ryser - Brualdi conjecture). In this direction we
also show that every Latin square of order $n$ has a {\em cycle-free partial
transversal} of size $n-o(n)$.

the average charge on a quantum dot. Variations of the resonance frequency and
the quality factor are determined by the change in average charge on the
quantum dot during a mechanical oscillation. The average charge, in turn, is
influenced by the gate voltage, the bias voltage, and the tunnel rates of the
barriers to the leads. At bias voltages that exceed the broadening due to
tunnel coupling, the resonance frequency and quality factor show a double dip
as a function of gate voltage. We find that increasing the current flowing
through the CNT at the Coulomb peak does not increase the damping, but in fact
decreases damping. Using a model with energy-dependent tunnel rates, we obtain
quantitative agreement between the experimental observations and the model. We
theoretically compare different contributions to the single-electron induced
nonlinearity, and show that only one term is significant for both the Duffing
parameter and the mode coupling parameter. We also present additional
measurements which support the model we develop: Tuning the tunnel barriers of
the quantum dot to the leads gives a 200-fold decrease of the quality factor.
Single-electron tunneling through an excited state of the CNT quantum dot also
changes the average charge on the quantum dot, bringing about a decrease in the
resonance frequency. In the Fabry-P\'{e}rot regime, the absence of charge
quantization results in a spring behaviour without resonance frequency dips,
which could be used, for example, to probe the transition from quantized to
continuous charge with a nanomechanical resonator.

gravitational lensing applications. Nevertheless, they generally lead to
nonphysical mass distributions in some regions. In this paper we revisit the
physical limitations of the pseudo-elliptical Navarro-Frenk-White (PNFW) model,
for a broad range of the potential ellipticity parameter \epsilon\ and
characteristic convergence \kappa_s focusing on the behavior of the mass
distribution close to the tangential critical curve, where tangential arcs are
expected to be formed. We investigate the shape of the mass distribution on
this region and the presence of negative convergence. We obtain a mapping from
the PNFW to the NFW model with elliptical mass distribution (ENFW) and provide
fitting formulae for connecting the parameters of both models. We compare the
arc cross section for these models using the ""infinitesimal circular source
approximation"". We find that the PNFW model is well-suited to model an
elliptical mass distribution on a larger \epsilon\ - \kappa_s parameter space
than previously expected. In particular values as large as \epsilon\ ~ 0.65 are
allowed for small \kappa_s. However, if we require the PNFW model to reproduce
the arc cross section of the ENFW well, the ellipticity is more restricted. We
also find that the negative convergence regions occur far from the arc
formation region and should therefore not be a problem for studies with
gravitational arcs. The determination of a domain of validity for the PNFW
model and the mapping to ENFW models could have implications for the use of
PNFW models for the inverse modeling of lenses and for fast arc simulations.

sensitivity is found to be the effective strain that is induced in the
nanoresonator due to the nonlinear oscillations, where we obtain an analytic
relationship between the induced effective strain and the actuation energy that
is applied to the graphene nanoresonator. An important implication of this work
is that there is no need for experimentalists to apply tensile strain to the
resonators before actuation in order to enhance the mass sensitivity. Instead,
enhanced mass sensitivity can be obtained by the far simpler technique of
actuating nonlinear oscillations of an existing graphene nanoresonator.

not for their VHE emission (e.g. the Galactic ""dark accelerators""). More than
half the currently known VHE sources are to be found in the Galactic plane.
Using standard techniques, CTA can carry out a survey of the region |l|<60
degrees, |b|<2 degrees in 250 hr (1/4th the available time per year at one
location) down to a uniform sensitivity of 3 mCrab (a ""Galactic Plane survey"").
CTA could also survey 1/4th of the sky down to a sensitivity of 20 mCrab in 370
hr of observing time (an ""all-sky survey""), which complements well the surveys
by the Fermi/LAT at lower energies and extended air shower arrays at higher
energies. Observations in (non-standard) divergent pointing mode may shorten
the ""all-sky survey"" time to about 100 hr with no loss in survey sensitivity.
We present the scientific rationale for these surveys, their place in the

that the Galactic Plane survey has the potential to detect hundreds of sources.
Implementing such a survey should be a major goal of CTA. Additionally, about a
dozen blazars, or counterparts to Fermi/LAT sources, are expected to be

hybridized with two degenerate bands of two conducting leads, conserving
orbital (band) and spin quantum numbers, as a function of the temperature $T$
and a splitting $\delta$ of the quantum dot levels which breaks the SU(4)
symmetry. The splitting can be regarded as a Zeeman (spin) or valley (orbital)
splitting. We use the non-crossing approximation (NCA), the slave bosons in the
mean-field approximation (SBMFA) and also the numerical renormalization group
(NRG) for large $\delta$. The model describes transport through clean C
nanotubes %with weak disorder and in Si fin-type field effect transistors,
under an applied magnetic field. The thermopower as a function of temperature
$S(T)$ displays two dips that correspond to the energy scales given by the
Kondo temperature $T_K$ and $\delta$ and one peak when $k_BT$ reaches the
charge-transfer energy. These features are much more pronounced than the
corresponding ones in the conductance, indicating that the thermopower is a
more sensitive probe of the electronic structure at intermediate or high
energies. At low temperatures ($T \ll T_K$) $T_K S(T)/T$ is a constant that
increases strongly near the degeneracy point $\delta=0$. We find that the SBMFA
fails to provide an accurate description of the thermopower for large $\delta$.
Instead, a combination of Fermi liquid relations with the quantum-dot
occupations calculated within the NCA gives reliable results for $T \ll T_K$.

coend C, which is a Hopf algebra in B, we defined in 2008 the double D(A) of A,
which is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra in B whose category of modules is
isomorphic to the center of the category of A-modules as a braided category.
Here, quasitriangular means endowed with an R-matrix (our notion of R-matrix
for a Hopf algebra in B involves the coend C of B). In general, i.e. when B
does not necessarily admit a coend, we construct a quasitriangular Hopf monad
d_A on the center Z(B) of B whose category of modules is isomorphic to the
center of the category of A-modules as a braided category. We prove that the
Hopf monad d_A may not be representable by a Hopf algebra. If B has a coend C,
then D(A) is the cross product of the Hopf monad d_A by C. Equivalently, the
Hopf monad d_A is the cross quotient of the Hopf algebra D(A) by the Hopf
algebra C.

relations are discussed in connection with ambiguities in the interpretation of
the state tomograms which are considered either as a set of the probability
distributions of random variables depending on extra parameters or as a single
joint probability distribution of these random variables and random parameters
with specific properties of the marginals. Examples of optical tomograms of
photon states, symplectic tomograms, and unitary spin tomograms of qudits are
given. A new universal integral inequality for generic wave function is
obtained on the base of tomographic entropic uncertainty relations.

clusters (GGCs) observed with the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) in both FUV
and NUV bands. This data-base is the largest homogeneous catalog of UV colors
ever published for stellar systems in our Galaxy. The proximity of GGCs makes
it possible to resolve many individual stars even with the somewhat low spatial
resolution of GALEX. This allows us to determine how the integrated UV colors
are driven by hot stellar populations, primarily horizontal branch stars and
their progeny. The UV colors are found to be correlated with various parameters
commonly used to define the horizontal branch morphology. We also investigate
how the UV colors vary with parameters like metallicity, age, helium abundance
and concentration. We find for the first time that GCs associated with the
Sagittarius dwarf galaxy have (FUV-V) colors systematically redder than GGCs
with the same metallicity. Finally, we speculate about the presence of an
interesting trend, suggesting that the UV color of GCs may be correlated with
the mass of the host galaxy, in the sense that more massive galaxies possess
bluer clusters.

Nevertheless, the equivalence between the expectation values of passive

stationary quantum states. Breakdown of the equivalence between passive
gravitational mass and energy at a microscopic level for stationary quantum
states can be experimentally detected by studying unusual electromagnetic
radiation, emitted by the atoms, supported and moved in the Earth gravitational
field with constant velocity using spacecraft or satellite.

opposite direction of the powerful vortex flow. This heat transfer cannot be

the concept of Pressure Gradient Waves (PGW) is proposed in the paper. PGW are
elastic waves which operate in compressible fluids with pressure gradients and
