consensus algorithm for arbitrary networks, proposed by B\'en\'ezit et al.. In
the initial setting, each node in the network has one of two possible states
(""yes"" or ""no""). Nodes can update their states by communicating with their
neighbors via a 2-bit message in an asynchronous clock setting. Eventually, all
nodes reach consensus on the majority states. We use the theory of electric
networks, random walks, and couplings of Markov chains to derive an O(N4 logN)
upper bound for the expected convergence time on an arbitrary graph of size N.

hardness [10]. Analytical arguments and simulations indicate that the system
always finds solutions for satisfiable formulae even in the frozen regimes of
random 3-SAT [11] and of locked occupation problems [12] (considered among the

statistical model for observing transcriptional regulatory interactions in

targets are both differentially expressed in a gene-specific, critical sample
contrast, as measured by repeated two-way t-tests. This method is conceptually
simple and easy to implement and integrate in any statistical software
environment. Benchmarking on standard E. coli and yeast reference datasets
showed that it performs equally well as the best existing methods. Analysis of
the predicted interactions suggested that it works best to infer
context-specific TF-target interactions which only co-express locally. We
confirmed this hypothesis on a dataset of more than 1,000 normal human tissue
samples, where we found that our method predicts highly tissue-specific and
functionally relevant interactions, whereas a global co-expression method only
associates general TFs to non-specific biological processes.

gamma-ray loudness and synchrotron peak frequency for BL Lac objects in both

that the apparent opening angle tentatively correlates with gamma-ray loudness
for FSRQs, but only when we use the 2FGL data. We also find that the total VLBA
flux density correlates with the synchrotron peak frequency for BL Lac objects
and FSRQs. The core brightness temperature also correlates with synchrotron
peak frequency, but only for the BL Lac objects. The low-synchrotron peaked

or access to, computer systems over a network. Two broad approaches exist to
tackle this problem: anomaly detection and misuse detection. An anomaly
detection system is trained only on examples of normal connections, and thus
has the potential to detect novel attacks. However, many anomaly detection
systems simply report the anomalous activity, rather than analysing it further
in order to report higher-level information that is of more use to a security
officer. On the other hand, misuse detection systems recognise known attack
patterns, thereby allowing them to provide more detailed information about an
intrusion. However, such systems cannot detect novel attacks.
  A hybrid system is presented in this paper with the aim of combining the
advantages of both approaches. Specifically, anomalous network connections are
initially detected using an artificial immune system. Connections that are
flagged as anomalous are then categorised using a Kohonen Self Organising Map,
allowing higher-level information, in the form of cluster membership, to be
extracted. Experimental results on the KDD 1999 Cup dataset show a low false
positive rate and a detection and classification rate for Denial-of-Service and

discovered at the LHC is the holographic techni-dilaton, a composite state
emerging from a strongly-coupled model of electroweak symmetry breaking. This
composite state differs from the SM for three main reasons. Its decay constant
is in general larger than the electroweak scale, hence suppressing all the
couplings to standard model particles with respect to an elementary Higgs
boson, with the exception of the coupling to photons and gluons, which is
expected to be larger than the standard-model equivalent.
  We discuss three classes of questions. Is it possible to lower the decay
constant, by changing the geometry of the holographic model? Is it possible to
lower the overall scale of the strong dynamics, by modifying the way in which
electroweak symmetry breaking is implemented in the holographic model? Is there
a clear indication in the data that production mechanisms other than
gluon-gluon fusion have been observed, disfavoring models in which the
holographic techni-dilaton has a large decay constant?
  We show that all of these questions are still open, given the present status
of theoretical as well as phenomenological studies, and that at present the
techni-dilaton hypothesis yields a fit to the data which is either as good as
the elementary Higgs hypothesis, or marginally better, depending on what sets
of data are used in the fit. We identify clear strategies for future work aimed
at addressing these three classes of open questions.
  In the process, we also compute the complete scalar spectrum of the
two-scalar truncation describing the GPPZ model, as well as the decay constant
of the holographic techni-dilaton in this model.

locality breakdown: links of increasing strength have the effect of turning

situations where f_NL is maximised if both curvatons share equally in
contributing the rest and situations where f_NL is maximised if only one of the
two curvatons contributes the rest. We are unable therefore to make any
completely general extrapolations about the expected non-gaussianity from N

chemical scheme is derived from applied combustion models that have been
methodically validated over a range of temperatures and pressures typical of
the atmospheric layers influencing the observations of hot Jupiters. We compare
the predictions obtained from this scheme with equilibrium calculations, with
different schemes available in the literature that contain N-bearing species

schemes that were not subjected to the same systematic validation, we find
significant differences whenever non-equilibrium processes take place. The
deviations from the equilibrium, and thus the sensitivity to the network, are
more important for HD189733b, as we assume a cooler atmosphere than for
HD209458b. We found that the abundances of NH3 and HCN can vary by two orders
of magnitude depending on the network, demonstrating the importance of
comprehensive experimental validation. A spectral feature of NH3 at 10.5$\mu$m
is sensitive to these abundance variations and thus to the chemical scheme. Due
to the influence of the kinetics, we recommend the use of a validated scheme to
model the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. Our network is robust for

between transmissions. Identifying which transmitters interfere with each other
is a crucial first step. In this paper we cast the task of estimating the a
wireless interference environment as a graph learning problem. Nodes represent
transmitters and edges represent the presence of interference between pairs of
transmitters. We passively observe network traffic transmission patterns and
collect information on transmission successes and failures. We establish bounds
on the number of observations (each a snapshot of a network traffic pattern)
required to identify the interference graph reliably with high probability.
  Our main results are scaling laws that tell us how the number of observations
must grow in terms of the total number of nodes $n$ in the network and the
maximum number of interfering transmitters $d$ per node (maximum node degree).
The effects of hidden terminal interference (i.e., interference not detectable
via carrier sensing) on the observation requirements are also quantified. We
show that to identify the graph it is necessary and sufficient that the
observation period grows like $d^2 \log n$, and we propose a practical
algorithm that reliably identifies the graph from this length of observation.
The observation requirements scale quite mildly with network size, and networks
with sparse interference (small $d$) can be identified more rapidly.
Computational experiments based on a realistic simulations of the traffic and
protocol lend additional support to these conclusions.

which is a function of a geometrical parameter $\alpha$.
  In this paper, the numerical procedure applied is briefly presented followed

made. The mechanical response of our numerical granular samples is studied in
the framework of the classical vertical compression test with constant lateral

envelope deviation from perfect sphericity, it can control mechanical
performances for large strains. Finally, we present some remarks concerning the

results for multivariate Hawkes processes are proven, which allows us to check
these assumptions by considering general dictionaries based on histograms,
Fourier or wavelet bases. Motivated by problems of neuronal activity inference,
we finally carry out a simulation study for multivariate Hawkes processes and
compare our methodology with the adaptive Lasso procedure proposed by Zou in

- \widetilde{\mathcal{O}}$, where $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}$ is a collection of
obstacles. Such spaces are of frequent occurrence as configuration spaces of
robots, where $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}$ represent either physical obstacles
that the robots need to avoid (e.g., walls, other robots, etc.) or illegal
states (e.g., all legs off-the-ground). As state-planning is translated to
path-planning on a configuration space, we collate equivalent plannings via
topologically-equivalent paths. This prompts finding or exploring the different
homology classes in such environments and finding representative optimal
trajectories in each such class.
  In this paper we start by considering the problem of finding a complete set
of easily computable homology class invariants for $(N-1)$-cycles in
$(\mathbb{R}^D - \widetilde{\mathcal{O}})$. We achieve this by finding explicit
generators of the $(N-1)^{st}$ de Rham cohomology group of this punctured
Euclidean space, and using their integrals to define cocycles. The action of
those dual cocycles on $(N-1)$-cycles gives the desired complete set of
invariants. We illustrate the computation through examples.
  We further show that, due to the integral approach, this complete set of
invariants is well-suited for efficient search-based planning of optimal robot
trajectories with topological constraints. Finally we extend this approach to
computation of invariants in spaces derived from $(\mathbb{R}^D -
\widetilde{\mathcal{O}})$ by collapsing subspace, thereby permitting
application to a wider class of non-Euclidean ambient spaces.

central tendency and data summary. Many practical questions often focus on
""Which element (gene or file or signal) occurs most often or is the most
typical among all elements in a network?"". In such cases mode regression
provides a convenient summary of how the regressors affect the conditional mode
and is totally different from other regression models based on conditional mean
or conditional quantile or conditional variance. Some inference methods have
been used for mode regression but none of them from the Bayesian perspective.
This paper introduces Bayesian mode regression by exploring three different
approaches. We start from a parametric Bayesian model by employing a likelihood
function that is based on a mode uniform distribution. It is shown that
irrespective of the original distribution of the data, the use of this special
uniform distribution is a very natural and effective way for Bayesian mode
regression. Posterior estimates based on this parametric likelihood, even under
misspecification, are consistent and asymptotically normal. We then develop a
nonparametric Bayesian model by using Dirichlet process (DP) mixtures of mode
uniform distributions and finally we explore Bayesian empirical likelihood mode
regression by taking empirical likelihood into a Bayesian framework. The paper
also demonstrates that a variety of improper priors for the unknown model
parameters yield a proper joint posterior. The proposed approach is illustrated
using simulated datasets and a real data set.

successful in screening the effect from scalar fields conformally coupled to

pulsar system. This is due to a combination of two effects: firstly the
existence of monopole and dipole radiation; secondly the Vainshtein suppression
comes from the hierarchy of scales between the inverse frequency scale and the
Vainshtein radius, rather than the orbital radius of the pulsar system.
Extensions of these results will have direct relevance to infrared
modifications of gravity, such as massive gravity theories, which are known to
exhibit a Vainshtein mechanism. Generalization to Galileon models with higher

The transition from a predictable, integrable behavior to ergodicity is one of

classical and quantum observables, the sum of the ensemble variance of the
temporal average and the ensemble average of temporal variance remains constant

Eigenstate Thermalization effect, the decrease in the inverse participation
ratio, and the disappearance of the integrals of motion. As an application, we
use this geometry to solve a known problem of optimization of the set of

function of galaxy mass, out to the halo region (8Re) of early-type galaxies
(ETGs). We select a sample of 674 massive ETGs (M*>3x10^10MSun) from the
SDSS-based SPIDER survey. By comparing with a large range of population
synthesis models, we derive robust constraints on the radial trends in age and
metallicity. Metallicity is unambiguously found to decrease outwards, with a
measurable steepening of the slope in the outer regions (Re<R<8Re). The
gradients in stellar age are found to be more sensitive to the models used, but
in general, the outer regions of ETGs feature older populations compared to the
cores. This trend is strongest for the most massive galaxies in our sample
(M*>10^11MSun). Furthermore, when segregating with respect to large scale
environment, the age gradient is more significant in ETGs residing in higher
density regions. These results shed light on the processes leading from the
formation of the central core to the growth of the stellar envelope of massive
galaxies. The fact that the populations in the outer regions are older and more
metal-poor than in the core suggests a process whereby the envelope of massive
galaxies is made up of accreted small satellites (i.e. minor mergers) whose

rigorous quantification of systematic uncertainties, high-quality data

Subaru and CFHT telescopes for all 51 clusters, in at least three bands per

allowing accurate photo-z estimates of lensed galaxies. In this paper, we
describe the cluster sample and observations, and detail the processing of the
SuprimeCam data to yield high-quality images suitable for robust weak-lensing
shape measurements and precision photometry. For each cluster, we present
wide-field color optical images and maps of the weak-lensing mass distribution,
the optical light distribution, and the X-ray emission, providing insights into
the large-scale structure in which the clusters are embedded. We measure the
offsets between X-ray centroids and Brightest Cluster Galaxies in the clusters,
finding these to be small in general, with a median of 20kpc. For offsets
<100kpc, weak-lensing mass measurements centered on the BCGs agree well with
values determined relative to the X-ray centroids; miscentering is therefore
not a significant source of systematic uncertainty for our mass measurements.

applying a frequentist technique we are able to identify a sample of the most

identified from the derived properties obtained from fitted spectral energy
distributions (SEDs). By SED modelling using both a simple modified blackbody
and fitting to a comprehensive grid of model SEDs, some 16 candidate
associations are identified as embedded massive star-forming regions. We derive
a two-selection colour criterion from this sample of log(F70/F500)\geq 1 and
log(F160/F350)\geq 1.6 to identify an additional 31 embedded massive star
candidates with no associated star-formation tracers. Using this result we can
build a picture of the present day star-formation of the complex, and by
extrapolating an initial mass function, suggest a current population of \approx
2 \times 10^4 young stellar objects (YSOs) present, corresponding to a star
formation rate (SFR) of 0.01-0.02 M\odot yr^-1. Comparing this resolved star
formation rate, to extragalactic star formation rate tracers (based on the

early times, and causes the Weyl gravitational potential to grow, rather than
decay, at late times. This leaves clear signatures in the low-$l$ CMB power
spectrum through the modified integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, strongly enhances
the linear growth of matter density perturbations and makes distinctive
predictions for other cosmological signals such as weak lensing and the power
spectrum of density fluctuations. The quasi-static approximation is shown to
work quite well from small to the near-horizon scales. We demonstrate that
Galileon models display a rich phenomenology due to the large parameter space
and the sensitive dependence of the model predictions on the Galileon
parameters. Our results show that some Galileon models are already ruled out by
present data and that future higher significance galaxy clustering, ISW and

increase the calibration accuracy of stellar locus matching. We also use a new
combined technique to estimate improved flat-field models for the Subaru

proxies for current cluster cosmology experiments. Cluster masses are measured
with a standard `color-cut' lensing method from three-filter photometry of each
field. Additionally, for 27 cluster fields with at least five-filter
photometry, we measure high-accuracy masses using a new method that exploits
all information available in the photometric redshift posterior probability
distributions of individual galaxies. Using simulations based on the COSMOS-30
catalog, we demonstrate control of systematic biases in the mean mass of the
sample with this method, from photometric redshift biases and associated
uncertainties, to better than 3%. In contrast, we show that the use of
single-point estimators in place of the full photometric redshift posterior
distributions can lead to significant redshift-dependent biases on cluster
masses. The performance of our new photometric redshift-based method allows us
to calibrate `color-cut` masses for all 51 clusters in the present sample to a
total systematic uncertainty of ~7% on the mean mass, a level sufficient to
significantly improve current cosmology constraints from galaxy clusters. Our
results bode well for future cosmological studies of clusters, potentially

(LBGs) (J1432+3358) at z=2.78, discovered in the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey
(NDWFS) Bootes field. The R-band magnitude of J1432+3358 is 22.29 AB, more than
two magnitudes brighter than typical L* LBGs at this redshift. The deep z-band
image reveals two components of J1432+3358 separated by 1.0"" with flux ratio of
3:1. The high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) rest-frame UV spectrum shows Lya
emission line and interstellar medium absorption lines. The absence of NV and
CIV emission lines, the non-detection in X-ray and radio wavelengths and
mid-infrared (MIR) colors indicate no or weak active galactic nuclei (AGN)
(<10%) in this galaxy. The galaxy shows broader line profile with the full
width half maximum (FWHM) of about 1000 km/s and larger outflow velocity (~500
km/s) than those of typical z~3 LBGs. The physical properties are derived by
fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) with stellar synthesis models.
The dust extinction, E(B-V)=0.12, is similar to that in normal LBGs. The star
formation rates (SFRs) derived from the SED fitting and the dust-corrected UV
flux are consistent with each other, ~300 Msun/yr, and the stellar mass is
1.3e11 Msun. The SFR and stellar mass in J1432+3358 are about an order of
magnitude higher than those in normal LBGs. The SED-fitting results support
that J1432+3358 has a continuous star formation history with the star formation
episode of 630 Myr. The morphology of J1432+3358 and its physical properties
suggest that J1432+3358 is in an early phase of 3:1 merger process. The unique
properties and the low space number density (~1e-7 Mpc^{-3})are consistent with
the interpretation that such galaxies are either found in a short unobscured
phase of the star formation or that small fraction of intensive star-forming
galaxies are unobscured.

whistler waves meet the Landau resonance with electrons for velocities less
than the thermal speed, and consequently the electric force is small compared
to the mirror force. As whistlers propagate through the inhomogeneous solar
wind, the perpendicular wave number increases through refraction, increasing
the Landau damping rate. However, the whistlers can survive because the
background kinetic Alfven wave turbulence creates a plateau by quasilinear
diffusion in the solar wind electron distribution at small velocities. It is
found that for whistler energy density of only ~10^-3 that of the kinetic
Alfven waves, the quasilinear diffusion rate due to whistlers is comparable to
KAW. Thus very small amplitude whistler turbulence can have a significant

contains 1392 CPM pairs with angular separations 30"" < \rho < 1800"", relative
proper motion between the two components less than 25 mas/yr, magnitudes and
colors of the secondaries consistent with those of dwarfs in the (M_V,V-J)
diagram. In addition, we list 21 candidate white-dwarf CPM companions with
separations under 300"", about half of which should be physical. We estimate a
0.31 fraction of pairs with red-dwarf companions to be physical systems (about
425 objects), while the rest (mostly wide pairs) are chance alignments. For
each candidate companion, the probability of a physical association is
evaluated. The distribution of projected separations s of the physical pairs
between 2 kAU and 64 kAU follows f(s) ~ s^{-1.5}, which decreases faster than
\""Opik's law. We find that Solar-mass dwarfs have no less than 4.4% +/- 0.3%
companions with separations larger than 2 kAU, or 3.8% +/- 0.3% per decade of
orbital separation in the 2 to 16 kAU range. The distribution of mass ratio of
those wide companions is approximately uniform in the 0.1<q<1.0 range, although
we observe a dip at q=0.5 which, if confirmed, could be evidence of bimodal
distribution of companion masses. New physical CPM companions to two exoplanet

unambiguously fix the outstanding spin-boost freedom associated with the

data, multiple sampled populations, and a good understanding of population
structure. We have used environmental and high-density genotype data to
describe the genetic basis of local adaptation in 21 populations of teosinte,
the wild ancestor of maize. We found that altitude, dispersal events and
admixture among subspecies formed a complex hierarchical genetic structure
within teosinte. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium revealed four mega-base
scale inversions that segregated among populations and had altitudinal clines.
Based on patterns of differentiation and correlation with environmental
variation, inversions and nongenic regions play an important role in local
adaptation of teosinte. Further, we note that strongly differentiated
individual populations can bias the identification of adaptive loci. The role
of inversions in local adaptation has been predicted by theory and requires
attention as genome-wide data become available for additional plant species.
These results also suggest a potentially important role for noncoding

contraction of coronal loops that are not involved in magnetic reconnection
processes. In this paper, we investigate five coronal eruptions originating
from four sigmoidal active regions, using high-cadence, high-resolution
narrowband EUV images obtained by the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO}). The
magnitudes of the flares associated with the eruptions range from the
GOES-class B to X. Owing to the high-sensitivity and broad temperature coverage
of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard SDO, we are able to identify
both the contracting and erupting components of the eruptions: the former is
observed in cold AIA channels as the contracting coronal loops overlying the
elbows of the sigmoid, and the latter is preferentially observed in warm/hot
AIA channels as an expanding bubble originating from the center of the sigmoid.
The initiation of eruption always precedes the contraction, and in the
energetically mild events (B and C flares), it also precedes the increase in
GOES soft X-ray fluxes. In the more energetic events, the eruption is
simultaneous with the impulsive phase of the nonthermal hard X-ray emission.
These observations confirm the loop contraction as an integrated process in
eruptions with partially opened arcades. The consequence of contraction is a
new equilibrium with reduced magnetic energy, as the contracting loops never
regain their original positions. The contracting process is a direct
consequence of flare energy release, as evidenced by the strong correlation of
the maximal contracting speed, and strong anti-correlation of the time delay of
contraction relative to expansion, with the peak soft X-ray flux. This is also
implied by the relationship between contraction and expansion, i.e., their
timing and speed.

representing the market value of all final goods and services produced by a
country within a given time. In this paper we question the assumption that GDP
measures production, and suggest that in reality it merely captures changes in
the rate of expansion of the money supply used to measure the price data it is
derived from. We first review the Quantity Theory of Money $MV=PT$, and show
that the Velocity of Circulation of Money(V) does not affect the price level as
claimed, as it is also a factor of the quantity of transactions(T). It then
follows directly that attempts to measure total production from any form of
price data as the GDP measurement does, will necessarily be confounded by the
inverse relationship between prices and the quantity of production, which
requires that as the total quantity of production increases, prices will drop.
Finally, in support of this claim we present an empirical analysis of the GDP
of nine countries and one currency union, showing that when normalized for
money supply growth GDP measures have been uniformly shrinking over the last 20
years, and discuss the possible reasons for this behaviour.

been popularly used in many learning tasks such as class-imbalance learning,

optimize AUC, while owing to the non-convexity and discontinuousness of AUC,
almost all approaches work with surrogate loss functions. Thus, the consistency
of AUC is crucial; however, it has been almost untouched before. In this paper,
we provide a sufficient condition for the asymptotic consistency of learning
approaches based on surrogate loss functions. Based on this result, we prove
that exponential loss and logistic loss are consistent with AUC, but hinge loss
is inconsistent. Then, we derive the $q$-norm hinge loss and general hinge loss
that are consistent with AUC. We also derive the consistent bounds for
exponential loss and logistic loss, and obtain the consistent bounds for many
surrogate loss functions under the non-noise setting. Further, we disclose an
equivalence between the exponential surrogate loss of AUC and exponential
surrogate loss of accuracy, and one straightforward consequence of such finding
is that AdaBoost and RankBoost are equivalent.

estimating 21cm HI signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We quantify
how imperfect point source subtraction due to limitations of the measurement
dataset yields structured residual signal in the dataset. We use the Cramer-Rao
lower bound, as a metric for quantifying the precision with which a parameter
may be measured, to estimate the residual signal in a visibility dataset due to
imperfect point source subtraction. We then propagate these residuals into two
metrics of interest for 21cm EoR experiments - the angular and two-dimensional
power spectrum - using a combination of full analytic covariant derivation,
analytic variant derivation, and covariant Monte Carlo simulations. This
methodology differs from previous work in two ways: (1) it uses information
theory to set the point source position error, rather than assuming a global
root-mean-square error, and (2) it describes a method for propagating the
errors analytically, thereby obtaining the full correlation structure of the
power spectra. The methods are applied to two upcoming low-frequency
instruments: the Murchison Widefield Array and the Precision Array for Probing
the Epoch of Reionization. In addition to the actual antenna configurations, we
apply the methods to minimally-redundant and maximally-redundant
configurations. We find that for peeling sources above 1 Jy, the amplitude of
the residual signal, and its variance, will be smaller than the contribution
from thermal noise for the observing parameters proposed for upcoming EoR
experiments, and that optimal subtraction of bright point sources will not be a
limiting factor for EoR parameter estimation. We then use the formalism to
provide an ab initio analytic derivation motivating the 'wedge' feature in the
two-dimensional power spectrum, complementing previous discussion in the
literature.

waters with different Lagrangian properties. They can be accurately detected in
a given velocity field by computing synoptic maps of the drift of synthetic
tracers and other Lagrangian indicators. Using Russian ship's catch and
location data for a number of commercial fishery seasons in the region of the
northwest Pacific with one of the richest fishery in the world, it is shown
statistically that the saury fishing grounds with maximal catches are not
randomly distributed over the region but located mainly along those LFs where
productive cold waters of the Oyashio Current, warmer waters of the southern
branch of the Soya Current, and waters of warm-core Kuroshio rings converge.
Computation of those fronts with the altimetric geostrophic velocity fields
both in the years with the First and Second Oyashio Intrusions shows that in
spite of different oceanographic conditions the LF locations may serve good
indicators of potential fishing grounds. Possible reasons for saury aggregation
near LFs are discussed. We propose a mechanism of effective export of nutrient
rich waters based on stretching of material lines in the vicinity of hyperbolic
objects in the ocean. The developed method, based on identifying LFs in any
velocity fields, is quite general and may be applied to forecast potential
fishing grounds for the other pelagic fishes in different seas and the oceans.

Signal Process",,,,"stat.CO cs.IT math.IT stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  To recover a sparse signal from an underdetermined system, we often solve a
constrained L1-norm minimization problem. In many cases, the signal sparsity
and the recovery performance can be further improved by replacing the L1 norm
with a ""weighted"" L1 norm. Without any prior information about nonzero elements
of the signal, the procedure for selecting weights is iterative in nature.
Common approaches update the weights at every iteration using the solution of a
weighted L1 problem from the previous iteration.
  In this paper, we present two homotopy-based algorithms that efficiently
solve reweighted L1 problems. First, we present an algorithm that quickly
updates the solution of a weighted L1 problem as the weights change. Since the
solution changes only slightly with small changes in the weights, we develop a
homotopy algorithm that replaces the old weights with the new ones in a small
number of computationally inexpensive steps. Second, we propose an algorithm
that solves a weighted L1 problem by adaptively selecting the weights while
estimating the signal. This algorithm integrates the reweighting into every
step along the homotopy path by changing the weights according to the changes
in the solution and its support, allowing us to achieve a high quality signal
reconstruction by solving a single homotopy problem. We compare the performance
of both algorithms, in terms of reconstruction accuracy and computational
complexity, against state-of-the-art solvers and show that our methods have
smaller computational cost. In addition, we will show that the adaptive
selection of the weights inside the homotopy often yields reconstructions of
higher quality.

  Applications; v2 simplifies the formalism allowing the presentation to be

case of infinite words: in general the infinite sum-of-products from which the
weight of a given word is derived will diverge. Many solutions to this problem
have been proposed, including restricting the type of weights used and
employing a different valuation function that forces convergence. In this paper
we describe an alternative approach that, rather than seeking to avoid the
inevitable divergences, instead embraces them as a source of useful
information. Specifically, rather than taking coefficients from an arbitrary
semiring S we instead take them from S^N. Doing this is useful because it gives
us information about how the weight of an infinite word does or does not
diverge, and if it does diverge what form the divergence takes --- e.g.,
polynomial, exponential, etc. This approach has proved to be incredibly useful
in the field of quantum simulation because when studying infinite systems,
information about how quantities of interest, such as energy or magnetization,
diverge is exactly what we want.
  In this paper we introduce a new kind of automaton which we call a diverging
automaton that maps infinite words to sequences of weights from a semiring and
which employs a Buchi-like boundary condition. We then develop a theory for
diverging power series and prove a Kleene Theorem connecting rational diverging
power series to diverging automata. Afterward we repeat this process by
introducing bidiverging automata which map biinfinite words to elements in S^(Z
x N), developing a theory for bidiverging power series, and proving another
Kleene Theorem. We conclude by describing how bidiverging automata are applied
to simulate biinfinite quantum systems.

kinds of divergences are intertwined in the collinear and soft parts at high
orders. We prescribe a method to disentangle the divergences in the framework
of the soft-collinear effective theory. The rapidity divergence is handled by
introducing the $\delta$ regulator in the collinear Wilson lines. The collinear
part, which consists of the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution
function (TMDPDF), is free of the rapidity divergence after the soft zero-bin
subtraction. There still remains the problem of mixing between the ultraviolet
and infrared divergences, which forbids the renormalization group description.
We show that the mixing is cancelled by the soft function. This suggests that
the collinear and soft parts should be treated as a whole in constructing a
consistent factorization theorem. The renormalization group behavior of the
combined collinear and soft parts is presented explicitly at one loop. We also
show that the integrated PDF can be obtained by integrating the TMDPDF over the

on molecular beam epitaxy. The wires grow horizontally along either the [100]

the existence of a preferential base width for longitudinal expansion, in

low-resistive electrical contacts and single hole transport at sub-Kelvin

luminosity galaxy cluster, Abell 1691, from SDSS and Galaxy Zoo data to
elucidate the relationships between environment and galaxy stellar mass for a
variety of observationally important cluster populations that include the
Butcher-Oemler blue fraction, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction and
other spectroscopic classifications of galaxies. From 342 cluster members, we
determine a cluster recession velocity of 21257+/-54 km/s and velocity
dispersion of 1009^+40_-36 km/s and show that although the cluster is fed by
multiple filaments of galaxies it does not possess significant sub-structure in
its core. We identify the AGN population of the cluster from a BPT diagram and
show that there is a mild increase in the AGN fraction with radius from the
cluster centre that appears mainly driven by high mass galaxies (log(stellar
mass)>10.8). Although the cluster blue fraction follows the same radial trend,
it is caused primarily by lower mass galaxies (log(stellar mass)<10.8).
Significantly, the galaxies that have undergone recent star-bursts or are
presently star-bursting but dust-shrouded (spectroscopic e(a) class galaxies)
are also nearly exclusively driven by low mass galaxies. We therefore suggest
that the Butcher-Oemler effect may be a mass-dependant effect. We also examine
red and passive spiral galaxies and show that the majority are massive
galaxies, much like the rest of the red and spectroscopically passive cluster
population. We further demonstrate that the velocity dispersion profiles of low
and high mass cluster galaxies are different. Taken together, we infer that the
duty cycle of high and low mass cluster galaxies are markedly different, with a
significant departure in star formation and specific star formation rates
observed beyond r_200 and we discuss these findings.

collapse can react with luminol to produce light (sonochemiluminescence, SCL).
SL and SCL intensities were recorded for several regimes related to the

Various arrangements of pits were studied, with the number of pits ranging from
no pits (comparable to a classic ultrasound reactor), to three-pits. Where
there was more than one pit present, in the high pressure regime the ejected
microbubbles combined into linear (two-pits) or triangular (three-pits) bubble

to be expressible in terms of a geometric phase, or alternatively in terms of

emission from the J=2-1 rotational transition of two CO isotopologues, 13CO and
C18O, over a 4' x 4' region around Orion B9/SMM 3. Both the 13CO and C18O lines
exhibit two well separated velocity components at about 1.3 and 8.7 km/s. The
emission of both CO isotopologues is more widely distributed than the
submillimetre dust continuum emission as probed by LABOCA. The LABOCA
870-micron peak position of SMM 3 is devoid of strong CO isotopologue emission,
which is consistent with our earlier detection of strong CO depletion in the
source. No signatures of a large-scale outflow were found towards SMM 3. The
13CO and C18O emission seen at ~1.3 km/s is concentrated into a single
clump-like feature at the eastern part of the map. The peak H2 column density
towards a C18O maximum of the low-velocity component is estimated to be ~10^22
cm-2. A velocity gradient was found across both the 13CO and C18O maps.
Interestingly, SMM 3 lies on the border of this velocity gradient. The 13CO and
C18O emission at ~1.3 km/s is likely to originate from the ""low-velocity part""
of Orion B. Our analysis suggests that it contains high density gas, which
conforms to our earlier detection of deuterated species at similarly low radial
velocities. The sharp velocity gradient in the region might represent a shock
front resulting from the feedback from the nearby expanding HII region NGC
2024. The formation of SMM 3, and possibly of the other members of Orion B9,
might have been triggered by this feedback.

emission. We report here on VHE gamma-ray observations of the Coma galaxy

complementing Fermi-LAT observations at GeV energies. No significant gamma-ray
emission from the Coma cluster was detected. Integral flux upper limits at the

s^-1 (VERITAS, >220 GeV} and ~2*10^-6 ph. m^-2 s^-1 (Fermi, 1-3 GeV),
respectively. We use the gamma-ray upper limits to constrain CRs and magnetic
fields in Coma. Using an analytical approach, the CR-to-thermal pressure ratio
is constrained to be < 16% from VERITAS data and < 1.7% from Fermi data
(averaged within the virial radius). These upper limits are starting to
constrain the CR physics in self-consistent cosmological cluster simulations
and cap the maximum CR acceleration efficiency at structure formation shocks to
be <50%. Assuming that the radio-emitting electrons of the Coma halo result
from hadronic CR interactions, the observations imply a lower limit on the
central magnetic field in Coma of (2 - 5.5) muG, depending on the radial
magnetic-field profile and on the gamma-ray spectral index. Since these values
are below those inferred by Faraday rotation measurements in Coma (for most of
the parameter space), this {renders} the hadronic model a very plausible
explanation of the Coma radio halo. Finally, since galaxy clusters are
dark-matter (DM) dominated, the VERITAS upper limits have been used to place
constraints on the thermally-averaged product of the total self-annihilation

emission features were detected in a broad interval of radial velocities, from
-7 to 55 km/s. OH maser emission in the 1667-MHz line was discovered in a
velocity range of 35-41 km/s. Stokes parameters of maser emission in the main
OH lines 1665 and 1667 MHz were measured. Zeeman splitting was detected in the
1665-MHz line at 33.4 and 39.4 km/s and in the 1667 MHz line only at 39.4 km/s.
The magnetic field intensity was estimated. A appreciable variability of Zeeman
splitting components was observed at 39 and 39.8 km/s in both main lines. The
extended spectrum and fast variability of the H2O maser emission together with
the variability of the Zeeman splitting components in the main OH lines can be
due to the composite clumpy structure of the molecular cloud and to the
presence in it of large-scale rotation and bipolar outflow as well as of
turbulent motions of material.

temperature $T_c$ as the absorbed probe power per unit volume $P_{abs}$ was
changed. The calculations give insight into a rate equation estimate which
suggests that the quasiparticle distributions can be driven far from the
thermal equilibrium value for typical readout powers. From $f(E)$ the driven
quasiparticle number density $N_{qp}$ and lifetime $\tau_r$ were calculated.
Using $N_{qp}$ we defined an effective temperature $T_N^*$ to describe the
driven $f(E)$. The lifetime was compared to the distribution averaged thermal
lifetime at $T_N^*$ and good agreement was found typically within a few
percent. We used $f(E)$ to model a representative SR. The complex conductivity
and hence the frequency dependence of the experimentally measured forward
scattering parameter $S_{21}$ of the SR as a function of $P_{abs}$ were found.
The non-equilibrium $S_{21}$ cannot be accurately modeled by a thermal
distribution at an elevated temperature $T_{21}^*$ having a higher
quality-factor in all cases studied and for low $P_{abs}$ $T_{21}^*\sim T_N^*$.
  Using $\tau_r$ and $N_{qp}$ we determined the achievable Noise Equivalent
Power of the resonator used as a detector as a function of $P_{abs}$. Simpler

Due to the ""open-air"" nature, key distribution is more susceptible to attacks

keys by two communicating parties separately without the need of key exchange

extract keys by measuring the random variation in wireless channels, e.g., RSS.
In this paper, we propose an efficient Secret Key Extraction protocol without
Chasing down Errors, SKECE. It establishes common cryptographic keys for two
communicating parties in wireless networks via the realtime measurement of
Channel State Information (CSI). It outperforms RSS-based approaches for key
generation in terms of multiple subcarriers measurement, perfect symmetry in
channel, rapid decorrelation with distance, and high sensitivity towards
environments. In the SKECE design, we also propose effective mechanisms such as
the adaptive key stream generation, leakage resilient consistence validation,
and weighted key recombination, to fully exploit the excellent properties of
CSI. We implement SKECE on off-the-shelf 802.11n devices and evaluate its
performance via extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that SKECE
achieves a more than 3x throughput gain in the key generation from one
subcarrier in static scenarios, and due to its high efficiency, a 50% reduction
on the communication overhead compared to the state-of-the-art RSS based

  The proof is based on an interplay of techniques from quantum many-body

we employ a result of Nachtergaele for lower bounding the spectral gap of
frustration-free quantum local Hamiltonians; a quasi-orthogonality property of
permutation matrices; a result of Oliveira which extends to the unitary group
the path-coupling method for bounding the mixing time of random walks; and a
result of Bourgain and Gamburd showing that dense subgroups of the special

from quantum many-body theory, in particular on the detectability lemma of
Aharonov, Arad, Landau, and Vazirani.

show the following pseudo-randomness property of generic quantum circuits:
Almost every circuit U of size O(n^k) on n qubits cannot be distinguished from

calculations cannot be fixed with certainty due to ambiguities in the choice of

we present a general discussion of the constraints of the renormalization group
(RG) invariance on the choice of the renormalization scale. We adopt the RG
based equations, which incorporate the scheme parameters, for a general
exposition of RG invariance, since they simultaneously express the invariance
of physical observables under both the variation of the renormalization scale
and the renormalization scheme parameters. We then discuss the self-consistency
requirements of the RG, such as reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, which
must be satisfied by the scale-setting method. The Principle of Minimal
Sensitivity (PMS) requires the slope of the approximant of an observable to
vanish at the renormalization point. This criterion provides a
scheme-independent estimation, but it violates the symmetry and transitivity
properties of the RG and does not reproduce the Gell-Mann-Low scale for QED
observables. The Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC) satisfies all of the
deductions of the RG invariance - reflectivity, symmetry, and transitivity.
Using the PMC, all non-conformal $\{\beta^{\cal R}_i\}$-terms (${\cal R}$
stands for an arbitrary renormalization scheme) in the perturbative expansion
series are summed into the running coupling, and one obtains a unique,
scale-fixed, scheme-independent prediction at any finite order. The PMC scales
and the resulting finite-order PMC predictions are both to high accuracy
independent of the choice of initial renormalization scale, consistent with RG
invariance. [...More in the text...]

the approximate solutions reflecting an intuitive order relation and
equivalence relation. However, the order relation and equivalence relation of
real numbers are not as intuitive as those of base-b expansions. Thus, this
paper introduces numerical computations to approximate all real numbers with
base-b expansions.

report four faint T-dwarf candidates in the direction of the Serpens Core with
CH4_on-CH4_off above 0.2 mag, estimated visual extinction in the range 1-9 mag

color-color and color-magnitude diagrams, indicate that two of our candidates
(ID1 and 2) are background contaminants (most likely heavily reddened
low-redshift quasars). The properties of the other two candidates (ID3 and 4)
are consistent with them being young members of the Serpens Core cluster,
although our analysis can not be considered conclusive. In particular, ID3 may
also be a foreground T-dwarf. It is detected by the Spitzer c2d survey but only
flux upper limits are available above 5.8 microns and, hence, we can not assess
the presence of a possible disk around this object. However, it presents some
similarities with other young T-dwarf candidates (SOri70 in the Sigma Ori
cluster and CFHTJ0344+3206 in the direction of IC348). If ID3 and 4 belong to
Serpens, they would have a mass of a few Jupiter masses and would be amongst
the youngest, lowest mass objects detected in a star-forming region so far.

cases, which complement the indecomposable case, which we dealt with earlier in

intersection of the two approaches. In this paper, we view the conjecture from
a broader global perspective. If $U_{/F}$ is any definite unitary group, which
is an inner form of $\GL(n)$ over $\K$, we point out how the eigenvariety
$\X(K^p)$ parametrizes a global $p$-adic Langlands correspondence between
certain $n$-dimensional $p$-adic semisimple representations $\rho$ of
$\Gal(\bar{\Q}|\K)$ (or what amounts to the same, pseudo-representations) and
certain Banach-Hecke modules $\mathcal{B}$ with an admissible unitary action of
$U(F\otimes \Q_p)$, when $p$ splits. We express the locally regular-algebraic
vectors of $\mathcal{B}$ in terms of the Breuil-Schneider representation of
$\rho$. Upon completion, this produces a candidate for the $p$-adic local
Langlands correspondence in this context. As an application, we give a weak
form of local-global compatibility in the crystalline case, showing that the
Banach space representations $B_{\xi,\zeta}$ of Schneider-Teitelbaum [ScTe] fit
the picture as predicted. There is a compatible global mod $p$ (semisimple)
Langlands correspondence parametrized by $\X(K^p)$. We introduce a natural
notion of refined Serre weights, and link them to the existence of crystalline
lifts of prescribed Hodge type and Frobenius eigenvalues. At the end, we give a
rough candidate for a local mod $p$ correspondence, formulate a local-global
compatibility conjecture, and explain how it implies the conjectural Ihara

system is analyzed in the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method. No
effective auxiliary field (dimeron) that corresponds to two-body propagation is
introduced.
  The Efimov effect is expected in the case of an infinite two-body scattering
length, and is believed to be related to the limit cycle behavior in the
three-body renormalization group equations (RGEs). If the one-loop property of
the RGEs for the nonrelativistic system without the dimeron field, which is
essential in deriving RGEs in the two-body sector, persists in the three-body
sector, it appears to prevent the emergence of limit cycle behavior. We explain
how the multi-loop diagrams contribute in the three-body sector without
contradicting the one-loop property of the RGEs, and derive the correct RGEs,
which lead to the limit cycle behavior. The Efimov parameter, $s_{0}$, is
obtained within a few percent error in the leading orders. We also remark on
the correct use of the dimeron formulation.
  We find rich RG-flow structure in the three-body sector. In particular, a
novel nontrivial fixed point of the three-body couplings is found when the
two-body interactions are absent. We also find, on the two-body nontrivial
fixed point, the limit cycle is realized as a loop of finite size in the space

mechanics. A Moyal description of quantum theory is used, where observables and
states are treated as classical functions on a classical phase space. A quantum
trajectory being an appropriate solution to quantum Hamiltonian equations is
also a function defined on a classical phase space. The difference, when
compare with classical theory, is in a deformation of a classical action of a
flow on observables and states to an appropriate quantum action. This leads
also to deformation of a multiplication rule for any quantum trajectory treated
as a one-parameter group of diffeomorphisms. Moreover, several examples are
given, presenting the developed formalism for particular quantum systems.

sets which a Gaussian random field does not hit almost surely. The main
assumptions are that the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are bounded from
below and that the canonical metric associated with the Gaussian random field
is dominated by an anisotropic metric. We deduce an upper bound for the hitting
probabilities and conclude that sets with small Hausdorff dimension are polar.
Moreover, the results allow for a translation of the Gaussian random field by a
random field, that is independent of the Gaussian random field and whose sample
functions are of bounded H\""older norm.

placed on some current vertex u, two players alternately remove a positive
integer weight from u and then move the token to a new current vertex adjacent
to u. When the weight of a vertex is set to 0, it is removed and its
neighborhood becomes a clique. The player making the last move wins. This
adaptation of Nim on graphs is called Vertexnim, and slightly differs from the
game Vertex NimG introduced by Stockman in 2004. Vertexnim can be played on
both directed or undirected graphs. In this paper, we study the complexity of
deciding whether a given game position of Vertexnim is winning for the first or
second player. In particular, we show that for undirected graphs, this problem
can be solved in quadratic time. Our algorithm is also available for the game
Vertex NimG, thus improving Stockman's exptime algorithm. In the directed case,
we are able to compute the winning strategy in polynomial time for several
instances, including circuits or digraphs with self loops.

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in many black hole and neutron star
binaries has the potential to provide a very powerful diagnostic of the inner
regions of the accretion flow. However, this potential cannot be realised
without a quantitative model for the QPO. We have recently shown that the same
truncated disc/hot inner flow geometry which is used to interpret the spectral
transitions can also directly produce the QPO from Lense-Thirring (vertical)
precession of the hot inner flow. This correctly predicts both the frequency
and spectrum of the QPO, and the tight correlation of these properties with the
total spectrum of the source via a changing truncation radius between the disc
and hot flow. This model predicts a unique iron line signature as a vertically
tilted flow illuminates different azimuths of the disc as it precesses. The
iron line arising from this rotating illumination is blue shifted when the flow
irradiates the approaching region of the spinning disc and red shifted when the
flow irradiates the receding region of the disc. This gives rise to a
characteristic rocking of the iron line on the QPO frequency which is a
necessary (and probably sufficient) test of a Lense-Thirring origin. This is
also an independent test of disc truncation models for the low/hard state, as
vertical precession cannot occur if there is a disc in the midplane.
  We show that it may be possible to observe this effect using archival data
from the Rossi X-ray timing explorer (RXTE) or XMM Newton. However, a clean
test requires a combination of moderate resolution and good statistics, such as
would be available from a long XMM-Newton observation or with data from the
proposed ESA mission LOFT.

sampling high-dimensional, stochastic lattice particle dynamics with complex
interactions. The method is based on the efficient coupling of different
spatial resolution levels, taking advantage of the low sampling cost in a
coarse space and by developing local reconstruction strategies from
coarse-grained dynamics. Microscopic reconstruction corrects possibly
significant errors introduced through coarse-graining, leading to the
controlled-error approximation of the sampled stochastic process. In this
manner, the proposed multi-level algorithm overcomes known shortcomings of
coarse-graining of particle systems with complex interactions such as combined
long and short-range particle interactions and/or complex lattice geometries.
  Specifically, we provide error analysis for the approximation of long-time
stationary dynamics in terms of relative entropy and prove that information
loss in the multi-level methods is growing linearly in time, which in turn
implies that an appropriate observable in the stationary regime is the
information loss of the path measures per unit time. We show that this
observable can be either estimated a priori, or it can be tracked
computationally a posteriori in the course of a simulation. The stationary
regime is of critical importance to molecular simulations as it is relevant to
long-time sampling, obtaining phase diagrams and in studying metastability
properties of high-dimensional complex systems. Finally, the multi-level nature
of the method provides flexibility in combining rejection-free and null-event
implementations, generating a hierarchy of algorithms with an adjustable number
of rejections that includes well-known rejection-free and null-event
algorithms.

differential equations with jumps (2BSDEJs for short), which generalizes the
continuous case considered by Soner, Touzi and Zhang [Probab. Theory Related
Fields 153 (2012) 149-190]. However, on the contrary to their formulation,
where they can define pathwise the density of quadratic variation of the
canonical process, in our setting, the compensator of the jump measure
associated to the jumps of the canonical process, which is the counterpart of
the density in the continuous case, depends on the underlying probability
measures. Then in our formulation of 2BSDEJs, the generator of the 2BSDEJs
depends also on the underlying probability measures through the compensator.
But the solution to the 2BSDEJs can still be defined universally. Moreover, we
obtain a representation of the $Y$ component of a solution of a 2BSDEJ as a
supremum of solutions of standard backward SDEs with jumps, which ensures the
uniqueness of the solution.

GdRu-1222 crystallizes in tetragonal phase with I4/mmm space group. GdRu-1222
is a reported superconducting ferromagnet with Ru spins magnetic ordering at
around 110 K and superconductivity below 40 K in Cu-O2 planes. Detailed
linear/non-linear first and higher order harmonic of AC susceptibility studies
unveiled the complex magnetism of GdRu-1222. A frequency dependent cusp is
observed in AC susceptibility ({\chi}ac) vs. T measurements. The change in cusp
position with applied frequency followed the well known Vogel-Fulcher law,
which is a feature to describe a spin-glass (SG) system with possibility of
embedded homogeneous/non-homogeneous magnetically interacting/non-interacting
ferromagnetic clusters. Such an interpretation is also supported by
thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) study at T = 60 K. Detailed interpretation
of AC magnetization results revealed the formation of magnetic (ferromagnetic)
homogenous/non-homogenous clusters of different sizes embedded in spin-glass
(SG) matrix. The magnetization vs. applied field loops do not saturate, even at
high applied fields (50 kOe), resulting in the short-range magnetic ordering in
the system, which causes the formation of clusters that freeze at low
temperatures. Temperature variation of first- and third-order susceptibility
harmonics show good agreement with Wohlfarth's model (WM), leading to the
superparamagnetism (SPM) state. Detailed magnetization (DC and AC both) results

apparent high mass stars. We present results of our multiwavelength study of
IRAS 20050+2720 which includes observations by Chandra and Spitzer, and 2MASS
and UBVRI photometry. In total, about 300 YSOs in different evolutionary stages
are found. We characterize the distribution of young stellar objects (YSOs) in
this region using a minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis. We newly identify a
second cluster core, which consists mostly of class II objects, about 10 arcmin
from the center of the cloud. YSOs of earlier evolutionary stages are more
clustered than more evolved objects. The X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of
IRAS 20050+2720 is roughly lognormal, but steeper than the XLF of the more
massive Orion nebula complex. IRAS 20050+2720 shows a lower N_H/A_K ratio
compared with the diffuse ISM.

black hole at the dynamical center of the Galaxy and is surrounded by dense
orbiting ionized and molecular gas. We present high resolution radio continuum
images of the central 3' and report a faint continuous linear structure
centered on Sgr A* with a PA~60 degrees. The extension of this feature appears
to be terminated symmetrically by two linearly polarized structures at 8.4 GHz,
~75"" from Sgr A*. A number of weak blobs of radio emission with X-ray
counterparts are detected along the axis of the linear structure. The linear
structure is best characterized by a mildly relativistic jet from Sgr A* with
an outflow rate 10^-6 solar mass per year. The near and far-sides of the jet
are interacting with orbiting ionized and molecular gas over the last 1-3
hundred years and are responsible for a 2"" hole, the ""minicavity"",
characterized by disturbed kinematics, enhanced FeII/III line emission, and
diffuse X-ray gas. The estimated kinetic luminosity of the outflow is
~1.2x10^{41} erg/s, so the interaction with the bar may be responsible for the
Galactic center X-ray flash inferred to be responsible for much of the
fluorescent Fe Kalpha line emission from the inner 100pc of the Galaxy.

  RNA-inspired ansatz","Identity of four-loop blind test protein and parts of figures 5 have
  been omitted in this preprint to ensure confidentiality of the protein
  structure prior to its public release",,"10.1371/journal.pone.0074830",,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consistently predicting biopolymer structure at atomic resolution from
sequence alone remains a difficult problem, even for small sub-segments of
large proteins. Such loop prediction challenges, which arise frequently in
comparative modeling and protein design, can become intractable as loop lengths
exceed 10 residues and if surrounding side-chain conformations are erased. This
article introduces a modeling strategy based on a 'stepwise ansatz', recently
developed for RNA modeling, which posits that any realistic all-atom molecular
conformation can be built up by residue-by-residue stepwise enumeration. When
harnessed to a dynamic-programming-like recursion in the Rosetta framework, the
resulting stepwise assembly (SWA) protocol enables enumerative sampling of a 12
residue loop at a significant but achievable cost of thousands of CPU-hours. In
a previously established benchmark, SWA recovers crystallographic conformations
with sub-Angstrom accuracy for 19 of 20 loops, compared to 14 of 20 by KIC
modeling with a comparable expenditure of computational power. Furthermore, SWA
gives high accuracy results on an additional set of 15 loops highlighted in the
biological literature for their irregularity or unusual length. Successes
include cis-Pro touch turns, loops that pass through tunnels of other
side-chains, and loops of lengths up to 24 residues. Remaining problem cases
are traced to inaccuracies in the Rosetta all-atom energy function. In five
additional blind tests, SWA achieves sub-Angstrom accuracy models, including
the first such success in a protein/RNA binding interface, the YbxF/kink-turn
interaction in the fourth RNA-puzzle competition. These results establish
all-atom enumeration as a systematic approach to protein structure that can
leverage high performance computing and physically realistic energy functions
to more consistently achieve atomic resolution.

J-aggregates with Levy disorder, which they contrasted with the previously
analyzed Gaussian and Lorentzian case [Phys. Rev. B, 79, 1 (2009)]. The
observations were explained by chain segmentation due to outliers, and its
interplay with localization of states in effective potential wells created by
typical random site energies. We argue that the previously known theory does
not break down and thus anticipates the properties of absorption band
