to improve the measurement of the size of the BLR and to estimate the black
hole mass. Optical spectra and g-band images were observed in 2005 using the
2.4m telescope at MDM Observatory. Integrated emission-line flux variations
were measured for Ha, Hb, Hg, and for HeII4686, as well as g-band fluxes and
the optical AGN continuum at 5100A. The g-band fluxes and the AGN continuum
vary simultaneously within the uncertainties, tau=(0.2+-1.1)days. We find that
the emission-line variations are delayed with respect to the variable g-band
continuum by tau(Ha)=56.3(+2.4-6.6)days, tau(Hb)=44.3(+3.0_-3.3)days,
tau(Hg)=58.1(+4.3-6.1)days, and tau(HeII4686)=22.3(+6.5-3.8)days. The blue and
red peak in the double peaked line profiles, as well as the blue and red outer
profile wings, vary simultaneously within +-3 days. This provides strong
support for gravitationally bound orbital motion of the dominant part of the
line emitting gas. Combining the time delay of Ha and Hb and the separation of
the blue and red peak in the broad double-peaked profiles in their rms spectra,
we determine Mbh_vir=1.77(+0.29-0.31)x10^8Msol and using sigma_line of the rms
spectra Mbh_vir=2.60(+0.23-0.31)x10^8Msol for the central black hole of
3C390.3, respectively. Using the inclination angle of the line emitting region
the mass of the black hole amounts to Mbh=0.86(+0.19-0.18)x10^9 Msol
(peak-separation) and Mbh=1.26(+0.21-0.16)x10^9 Msol (sigma_line),
respectively. This result is consistent with the black hole masses indicated by
simple accretion disk models to describe the observed double-peaked profiles,
derived from the stellar dynamics of 3C390.3, and with the AGN
radius-luminosity relation. Thus, 3C390.3 as a radio-loud AGN with a low
Eddington ratio, Ledd/Lbol=0.02, follows the same AGN radius-luminosity
relation as radio-quiet AGN.

Universe (halo stars, globular clusters and satellites of the Milky Way) it is
possible that certain physical processes may have led to the spatial separation
of lithium and local reduction of [Li/H]. We study the question of lithium
diffusion after the cosmological recombination in sub-Jeans dark matter haloes,
taking into account that more than 95% of lithium remains in the singly-ionized
state at all times. Large scattering cross sections on the rest of the ionized
gas leads to strong coupling of lithium to protons and its initial direction of
diffusion coincides with that of H$^+$. In the rest frame of the neutral gas
this leads to the diffusion of H$^+$ and Li$^+$ out of overdensities with the
trend of reducing [Li/H] in the minima of gravitational wells relative to the
primordial value. We quantify this process and argue that, with certain
qualifications, it may have played a significant role in creating local lithium
deficiency within the primordial dark matter haloes, comparable to those
observed along the Spite plateau.

that in the case of an ultrarelativistic counterpropagating pulse, a

generated by a relatively slow and heavy foil than by a fast and light one.
This counterintuitive result is explained with the larger reflectivity of a
heavy foil, which compensates for its lower relativistic Doppler factor.
Moreover, since the counterpropagating pulse is ultrarelativistic, the foil is
abruptly dispersed and only the first few cycles of the counterpropagating
pulse are reflected. Our multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations show
that even few-cycle counterpropagating laser pulses can be further shortened
(both temporally and in the number of laser cycles) with pulse amplification. A
single few-cycle, multi-petawatt laser pulse with several joule of energy and
with peak intensity exceeding 10^23 W/cm^2 can be generated already employing
next-generation high-power laser systems. In addition, the carrier-envelope

However, for $t<0$, its size is less than the Planck length $l_P=1.62 10^{-35}
m$. In this model, the universe undergoes an inflationary expansion with the
Planck density $\rho_P=5.16 10^{99} g/m^3$ that brings it to a size $a_1=2.61

physical at a time $t_i=8.32 10^{-45} s$ from which the velocity of sound is
less than the speed of light. When $a\gg a_1$, the universe evolves like in the
standard model. We describe the transition from the pre-radiation era to the

constant $\hbar$ plays the role of finite size effects (the standard Big Bang
theory is recovered for $\hbar=0$).

environments. For example, transfers of multiple gigabytes are commonplace, as
are replicated blocks of such sizes. There is a need for fast error-correction
or data reconciliation in such settings even when the expected number of errors
is small.
  Motivated by such cloud reconciliation problems, we consider error-correction
schemes designed for large data, after explaining why previous approaches
appear unsuitable. We introduce Biff codes, which are based on Bloom filters
and are designed for large data. For Biff codes with a message of length $L$
and $E$ errors, the encoding time is $O(L)$, decoding time is $O(L + E)$ and
the space overhead is $O(E)$. Biff codes are low-density parity-check codes;
they are similar to Tornado codes, but are designed for errors instead of
erasures. Further, Biff codes are designed to be very simple, removing any
explicit graph structures and based entirely on hash tables. We derive Biff
codes by a simple reduction from a set reconciliation algorithm for a recently
developed data structure, invertible Bloom lookup tables. While the underlying
theory is extremely simple, what makes this code especially attractive is the
ease with which it can be implemented and the speed of decoding. We present
results from a prototype implementation that decodes messages of 1 million
words with thousands of errors in well under a second.

edges). In many studies, such complex networks of interactions have been
derived from empirical time series for various spatially extended systems and
have been repeatedly reported to possess the same, possibly desirable,
properties (e.g. small-world characteristics and assortativity). In this thesis
we study whether and how interaction networks are influenced by the analysis
methodology, i.e. by the way how empirical data is acquired (the spatial and
temporal sampling of the dynamics) and how nodes and edges are derived from
multivariate time series. Our modeling and numerical studies are complemented
by field data analyses of brain activities that unfold on various spatial and
temporal scales. We demonstrate that indications of small-world characteristics
and assortativity can already be expected due solely to the analysis
methodology, irrespective of the actual interaction structure of the system. We
develop and discuss strategies to distinguish the properties of interaction
networks related to the dynamics from those spuriously induced by the analysis
methodology. We show how these strategies can help to avoid misinterpretations
when investigating the dynamics of spatially extended systems.

$p=(\alpha \rho+k\rho^{1+1/n})c^2$ having a linear component and a polytropic
component. In this paper, we consider negative indices $n<0$. In that case, the
polytropic component dominates in the late universe where the density is low.
For $\alpha=0$, $n=-1$ and $k=-\rho_{\Lambda}$, we obtain a model of late
universe describing the transition from the matter era to the dark energy era.
The universe exists eternally in the future and undergoes an inflationary
expansion with the cosmological density $\rho_{\Lambda}=7.02 10^{-24} g/m^3$ on
a timescale $t_{\Lambda}=1.46 10^{18} s$. For $\alpha=0$, $n=-1$ and
$k=\rho_{\Lambda}$, we obtain a model of cyclic universe appearing and
disappearing periodically. If we were living in this universe, it would
disappear in about 2.38 billion years. We make the connection between the early
and the late universe and propose a simple equation describing the whole
evolution of the universe. This leads to a model of universe that is eternal in
past and future without singularity (aioniotic universe). This model exhibits a
nice ""symmetry"" between an early and late phase of inflation, the cosmological
constant in the late universe playing the same role as the Planck constant in
the early universe. The Planck density and the cosmological density represent
fundamental upper and lower bounds differing by 122 orders of magnitude. The
cosmological constant ""problem"" may be a false problem. We determine the
potential of the scalar field (quintessence, tachyon field) corresponding to
the generalized equation of state $p=(\alpha \rho+k\rho^{1+1/n})c^2$. We also
propose a unification of pre-radiation, radiation and dark energy through the
quadratic equation of state $p/c^2=-4\rho^2/3\rho_P+\rho/3-4\rho_{\Lambda}/3$.

dynamical system and it is known that well behaved dynamical systems must be
necessarily controllable. The generalization of binary convolutional encoders
over arbitrary finite groups is made by using the extension of groups, instead
of direct product. In this way, given finite groups U,S and Y, a wide-sense
homomorphic encoder (WSHE) is a FSM with U as inputs group, S as states group,

for measuring correlations, we introduce a statistic that measures the
dispersion of the data with respect to the data translated in time. The

studying arrival time variations over timescales approaching the average

problem: given a set $L$ of links, compute the largest possible subset
$L'\subseteq L$ of links that can be scheduled simultaneously without
interference. This problem is particularly challenging in the physical
interference model based on SINR constraints (referred to as the SINR model),
which has gained a lot of interest in recent years. Constant factor
approximation algorithms have been developed for this problem, but low
complexity distributed algorithms that give the same approximation guarantee in
the SINR model are not known. Distributed algorithms are especially challenging
in this model, because of its non-locality.
  In this paper, we develop a set of fast distributed algorithms in the SINR
model, providing constant approximation for the maximum link scheduling problem
under uniform power assignment. We find that different aspects of available
technology, such as full/half-duplex communication, and non-adaptive/adaptive
power control, have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm;
these issues have not been explored in the context of distributed algorithms in
the SINR model before. Our algorithms' running time is $O(g(L) \log^c m)$,
where $c=1,2,3$ for different problem instances, and $g(L)$ is the ""link
diversity"" determined by the logarithmic scale of a communication link length.
Since $g(L)$ is small and remains in a constant range in most cases, our
algorithms serve as the first set of ""sublinear"" time distributed solution. The
algorithms are randomized and crucially use physical carrier sensing in
distributed communication steps.

planet detection algorithm, to confirm that there is no evidence for the
recently proposed two additional planets (f and g). Limiting the scope to the
four originally detected planets, we assess the dynamical stability of the
system and find bounded chaos in the orbital motion. For the planet d, the
characteristic Lyapunov time is 38 yr. Long-term numerical integration reveals
that the system of four planets is stable, with the eccentricity of the planet
d changing quasi-periodically in a tight range around 0.27, and with its
semimajor axis varying only a little.
  The spin-orbit interaction of GJ 581d with its host star is dominated by the
tides exerted by the star on the planet. We model this interaction, assuming a
terrestrial composition of the mantle. Besides the customarily included secular
parts of the triaxiality-caused and tidal torques, we also include these
torques' oscillating components. It turns out that, dependent on the mantle
temperature, the planet gets trapped into the 2:1 or an even higher spin-orbit
resonance. It is very improbable that the planet could have reached the 1:1
resonance. This enhances the possibility of the planet being suitable for

high-resolution X-ray spectrum with the Chandra LETG/ACIS-S instrument and a
low resolution spectrum with Suzaku. This allows us, for the first time, to
investigate the role of X-rays on the wind structure in a bona fide weak-wind
system and to determine whether there actually is a massive, hot wind. The
X-ray emission measure indicates that the outflow is an order of magnitude
greater than that derived from UV lines and is commensurate with the nominal
wind-luminosity relationship for O-stars. Therefore, the ``weak-wind
problem''---identified from cool wind UV/optical spectra---is largely resolved
by accounting for the hot wind seen in X-rays. From X-ray line profiles,
Doppler shifts, and relative strengths, we find that this weak-wind star is
typical of other late O dwarfs. The X-ray spectra do not suggest a magnetically
confined plasma---the spectrum is soft and lines are broadened; Suzaku spectra
confirm the lack of emission above 2 keV. Nor do the relative line shifts and
widths suggest any wind decoupling by ions. The He-like triplets indicate that
the bulk of the X-ray emission is formed rather close to the star, within 5
stellar radii. Our results challenge the idea that some OB stars are
``weak-wind'' stars that deviate from the standard wind-luminosity
relationship. The wind is not weak, but it is hot and its bulk is only
detectable in X-rays.

velocity dispersion, we analyse multi-epoch spectroscopic data of the inner
regions of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) obtained as part of
the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey. Following a quantitative assessment of the
variability, we use the radial velocities of non-variable sources to place an
upper limit of 6 km/s on the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of stars within
a projected distance of 5 pc from the centre of the cluster. After accounting
for the contributions of undetected binaries and measurement errors through
Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that the true velocity dispersion is
likely between 4 and 5 km/s given a range of standard assumptions about the
binary distribution. This result is consistent with what is expected if the
cluster is in virial equilibrium, suggesting that gas expulsion has not altered
its dynamics. We find that the velocity dispersion would be ~25 km/s if
binaries were not identified and rejected, confirming the importance of the
multi-epoch strategy and the risk of interpreting velocity dispersion

R136, the central, young, massive star cluster in the 30 Doradus complex of the
Large Magellanic Cloud, are the single stars whose masses substantially exceed
the canonical stellar upper mass limit of 150 M_sun. A recent study by us,
viz., that of Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012; Paper I), which involves realistic
N-body computations of star clusters mimicking R136, indicates that such
""super-canonical"" (SC) stars can be formed out of a dense stellar population
with a canonical initial mass function (IMF) through dynamically induced
mergers of the most massive binaries. Here we study the formation of SC stars
in the R136 models of Paper I in detail. To avoid forming extraneous SC stars
from initially highly eccentric primordial binaries as in Paper I, we compute
additional models with only initially circular primordial binaries. We also
take into account the mass-evolution of the SC stars using detailed stellar
evolutionary models that incorporate updated treatments of stellar winds. We
find that SC stars begin to form via dynamical mergers of massive binaries from
approx. 1 Myr cluster age. We obtain SC stars with initial masses up to approx.
250 M_sun from these computations. Multiple SC stars are found to remain bound
to the cluster simultaneously within a SC-lifetime. These properties of the
dynamically formed SC stars are consistent with those observed in R136. In
fact, the stellar evolutionary models of SC stars imply that had they formed
primordially along with the rest of the R136 cluster, i.e., violating the
canonical upper limit, they would have evolved below the canonical 150 M_sun
limit by approx. 3 Myr, the likely age of R136, and would not have been
observable as SC stars at the present time in R136. This strongly supports the
dynamical formation scenario of the observed SC stars in R136.

sources without associations at other wavelengths which exhibit spectral
features consistent with mono-energetic lines at energies of approximately 111

Galaxy, it is tempting to interpret these unassociated sources as nearby dark
matter subhalos, powered by ongoing annihilations. In this paper, we study the
spectrum, luminosity, and angular distribution of these sources, with the
intention of testing the hypothesis that they are, in fact, dark matter
subhalos. We find that of the 12 sources containing at least one prospective
line photon, only 2 exhibit an overall gamma-ray spectrum which is consistent
with that predicted from dark matter annihilations (2FGL J2351.6-7558 and 2FGL

statistical significance of the remaining two prospective line photons is
negligible. That being said, we cannot rule out the possibility that either or

galactic latitude distribution are not inconsistent with a dark matter origin.

their parameters gamma_i={m_0, m_{1/2}, mu_0, A_0, B_0,...} and the maximal
likelihood L to fit the experimental data are usually regarded as two different
problems. We show that, if one regards the EW minimum conditions as constraints
that fix the EW scale, this commonly held view is not correct and that the
likelihood contains all the information about fine-tuning. In this case we show
that the corrected likelihood is equal to the ratio L/Delta of the usual
likelihood L and the traditional fine tuning measure Delta of the EW scale. A
similar result is obtained for the integrated likelihood over the set
{gamma_i}, that can be written as a surface integral of the ratio L/Delta, with
the surface in gamma_i space determined by the EW minimum constraints. As a
result, a large likelihood actually demands a large ratio L/Delta or
equivalently, a small chi^2_{new}=chi^2_{old}+2*ln(Delta). This shows the
fine-tuning cost to the likelihood (chi^2_{new}) of the EW scale stability
enforced by SUSY, that is ignored in data fits. A good
chi^2_{new}/d.o.f.\approx 1 thus demands SUSY models have a fine tuning amount
Delta<<exp(d.o.f./2), which provides a model-independent criterion for
acceptable fine-tuning. If this criterion is not met, one can thus rule out
SUSY models without a further chi^2/d.o.f. analysis. Numerical methods to fit
the data can easily be adapted to account for this effect.

topological configurations in cosmology, which occur in Euclidean quantum
gravity (EQG) when the latter is viewed as the derivative of the physical
theory in the Lorentzian signature spacetime. At the topological level EQG
inherits from the Lorentzian theory the arrow of time and incorporates special
junction conditions on quantum fields whose quantum fluctuations make the
contribution of such topologies vanishing. This effect is more general than the
recently suggested conformal mechanism of suppression of vacuum no-boundary
instantons in the microcanonical statistical sum of quantum cosmology driven by
a conformal field theory (CFT). In contrast to conformal properties of the CFT
driven cosmology, this effect is based only on short-distance behavior of local
boson fields and Pauli principle for fermions. Application of this effect in
the CFT cosmology treated as initial conditions for inflationary Universe
suggests the thermal nature of the primordial power spectrum of the CMB
anisotropy. This can be responsible for a thermal contribution to the red tilt
of this spectrum, additional to its conventional vacuum component.

matter/dark energy dominated universe (LambdaCDM) whose matter is comprised of
massive particles as used in cosmological simulations. This establishes a long
distance effective fluid, valid for length scales larger than the non-linear
scale ~ 10 Mpc, and provides the complete description of large scale structure
formation. Extracting the time dependence, we derive recursion relations that
encode the perturbative solution. This is exact for the matter dominated era
and quite accurate in LambdaCDM also. The effective fluid is characterized by
physical parameters, including sound speed and viscosity. These two fluid
parameters play a degenerate role with each other and lead to a relative
correction from standard perturbation theory of the form ~ 10^{-6}c^2k^2/H^2.
Starting from the linear theory, we calculate corrections to cosmological
observables, such as the baryon-acoustic-oscillation peak, which we compute
semi-analytically at one-loop order. Due to the non-zero fluid parameters, the
predictions of the effective field theory agree with observation much more
accurately than standard perturbation theory and we explain why. We also
discuss corrections from treating dark matter as interacting or wave-like and
other issues.

Product Expansion in terms of a transition amplitude on top of a color flux
tube (FT). That picture is valid at any value of the 't Hooft coupling. So far
it has been efficiently used at weak coupling (WC) in cases where only a single
particle is flowing. At any finite value of the coupling however, an infinite
number of particles are flowing on top of the color FT. A major open problem in
this approach was how to deal with generic multi-particle states at WC. In this
paper we study the propagation of any number of FT excitations at WC. We do
this by first mapping the WL into a sum of two point functions of local
operators. This map allows us to translate the integrability techniques
developed for the spectrum problem back to the WL. E.g., the FT Hamiltonian can
be represented as a simple kernel acting on the loop. Having an explicit
representation for the FT Hamiltonian allows us to treat any number of
particles on an equal footing. We use it to bootstrap some simple cases where
two particles are flowing, dual to N2MHV amplitudes. The FT is integrable and
therefore has other (infinite set of) conserved charges. The generating
function of conserved charges is constructed from the monodromy (M) matrix
between sides of the polygon. We compute it for some simple examples at leading
order at WC. At strong coupling (SC), these Ms were the main ingredients of the
Y-system solution. To connect the WC and SC computations, we study a case where
an infinite number of particles are propagating already at leading order at WC.
We obtain a precise match between the WC and SC Ms. That match is the WL
analogue of the well known Frolov-Tseytlin limit where the WC and SC
descriptions become identical. Hopefully, putting the WC and SC descriptions on
the same footing is the first step in understanding the all loop structure.

novae in the super-soft source (SSS) phase of the outburst. In this work
expanding nova atmosphere models are developed and used to study the effect of
mass loss on the SSS spectra. The very high temperatures combined with high
expansion velocities and large radial extension make nova in the SSS phase very
interesting but also difficult objects to model.
  The radiation transport code PHOENIX was applied to SSS novae before, but
careful analysis of the old results has revealed a number of problems which
lead to new methods and improvements to the code: 1) an improved NLTE module (a
new opacity formalism, rate matrix solver, global iteration scheme, and
temperature correction method); 2) a new hybrid hydrostatic-dynamic nova
atmosphere setup; 3) the models are treated in pure NLTE (no LTE approximation
for any opacity).
  With the new framework a modest amount of models (limited by computation
time) are calculated. These show: 1) systematic behaviour for various
atmospheric conditions, 2) the effect of expansion on the model spectrum is
significant, and 3) the spectra are sensitive to the details of the atmospheric
structure. The models are compared to the ten well-exposed grating spectra
presently available: 5x V4743 Sgr, 3x RS Oph, and 2x V2491 Cyg. Although the
models are on a coarse grid they do match the observations surprisingly well.
  Also, hydrostatic models are computed. The reproduction of the data is
clearly inferior to the expanding models and, more importantly, their
interpretation with hydrostatic models leads to conclusions opposite to those
from expanding models.
  The models enable the derivation of accurate constraints on the physical
conditions deep in the nova atmosphere that are revealed only in the SSS phase.

The linear momentum density associated with the electromagnetic field is
p_EM(r,t)=E(r,t)\timesH(r,t)/c^2, whether the field is in vacuum or in a
ponderable medium. [Homogeneous, linear, isotropic media are typically
specified by their electric and magnetic permeabilities epsilon_0*epsilon(w)
and mu_0*mu(w).] The electromagnetic momentum residing in a ponderable medium
is often referred to as Abraham momentum. When an electromagnetic wave enters a
medium, say, from the free space, it brings in Abraham momentum at a rate
determined by the density distribution p_EM(r,t), which spreads within the
medium with the light's group velocity. The balance of the incident, reflected,
and transmitted (electromagnetic) momenta is subsequently transferred to the
medium as mechanical force in accordance with Newton's second law. The
mechanical force of the radiation field on the medium may also be calculated by
a straightforward application of the generalized form of the Lorentz law. The
fact that these two methods of force calculation yield identical results is the
basis of our claim that the equations of electrodynamics (Maxwell + Lorentz)
comply with the momentum conservation law. When applying the Lorentz law, one
must take care to properly account for the effects of material dispersion and
absorption, discontinuities at material boundaries, and finite beam dimensions.

The experiment is based on two identical LAr-TPCs complemented by magnetized

T600 detector, the largest LAr-TPC ever built with a size of about 600 ton of

be placed downstream of the two LAr-TPC detectors to perform charge

will offer remarkable discovery potentialities, collecting a very large number
of unbiased events both in the neutrino and antineutrino channels, largely
adequate to definitely settle the origin of the observed neutrino-related

contingent forms of strong altruism can spread when rare under realistic group
sizes and levels of migration. Our analysis combines group-centric and
gene-centric perspectives, allows for arbitrary strength of selection, and
leads to extensions of Hamilton's rule for the spread of altruistic alleles,

a mechanical part. The local and instantaneous density of the electromagnetic
part of the momentum is given by the Poynting vector divided by the square of
the speed of light in vacuum, irrespective of the nature of the electromagnetic
fields or the local or global properties of the material media. The mechanical
part of the momentum is associated with the action of the electromagnetic field
on the atomic constituents of the media, as specified by the Lorentz law of
force. Proper interpretation and application of the Maxwell-Lorentz equations
within the material bodies as well as at their surfaces and interfaces is all
that is needed to obtain a complete picture of the momentum of light, including
detailed numerical values at each and every point in space and time. That the
Abraham-Minkowski controversy surrounding the momentum of light inside material

appreciation for the completeness and consistency of the macroscopic
Maxwell-Lorentz theory, inadequate treatment of the electromagnetic force and
torque at the material boundaries, and an undue emphasis on the necessity of
coupling the equations of electrodynamics to those of the theory of elasticity
for proper treatment of mechanical momentum. The present paper reports the
resolution of the Abraham-Minkowski controversy within the framework of the
classical theory of electrodynamics, without resort to such complicating and
ultimately unnecessary factors as pseudo-momentum, special surface forces,
alternative energy-momentum tensors, and hidden momenta, that have caused so
much confusion for such a long period of time.

functions of space and time, we compare and contrast two versions of the
Poynting vector, namely, S=ExB/mu_0 and S=ExH. Here E is the electric field, H
the magnetic field, B the magnetic induction, and mu_0 the permeability of free
space. We argue that the identification of one or the other of these Poynting
vectors with the rate of flow of electromagnetic energy is intimately tied to
the nature of magnetic dipoles and the way in which these dipoles exchange
energy with the electromagnetic field. In addition, the manifest nature of both
electric and magnetic dipoles in their interactions with the electromagnetic
field has consequences for the Lorentz law of force. If the conventional
identification of magnetic dipoles with Amperian current loops is extended
beyond Maxwell's macroscopic equations to the domain where energy, force,
torque, momentum, and angular momentum are active participants, it will be
shown that ""hidden energy"" and ""hidden momentum"" become inescapable
consequences of such identification with Amperian current loops. Hidden energy
and hidden momentum can be avoided, however, if we adopt S=ExH as the true
Poynting vector, and also accept a generalized version of the Lorentz force
law. We conclude that the identification of magnetic dipoles with Amperian
current loops, while certainly acceptable within the confines of Maxwell's
macroscopic equations, is inadequate and leads to complications when
considering energy, force, torque, momentum, and angular momentum in
electromagnetic systems that involve the interaction of fields and matter.

vertexical family of differential inclusions. Defined on open hypercubes, these
families are characterized by particular good behavior under projection maps.
The motivating examples are certain families of reaction networks -- including
reversible, weakly reversible, endotactic, and strongly endotactic reaction
networks -- that give rise to vertexical families of mass-action differential
inclusions. We prove that vertexical families are amenable to structural
induction. Consequently, a trajectory of a vertexical family approaches the
boundary if and only if either the trajectory approaches a vertex of the
hypercube, or a trajectory in a lower-dimensional member of the family
approaches the boundary. With this technology, we make progress on the global
attractor conjecture, a central open problem concerning mass-action kinetics
systems. Additionally, we phrase mass-action kinetics as a functor on reaction
networks with variable rates.

than F^3, such as F^4-type operators appearing at the next order in the

complex. The color structure of some of the F^4 operators is incompatible with
a simple color-kinematics duality based on structure constants f^{abc}, but

(ULF) wave activity has been detected in regions just upstream of the bow
shocks of magnetized planets. This feature was first observed ahead of the
Earth's bow shock, and the corresponding region was called the ULF wave
foreshock, which is embedded within the planet's foreshock. The properties as
well as the spatial distribution of ULF waves within the Earth's foreshock have
been extensively studied over the last three decades and have been explained as
a result of plasma instabilities triggered by solar wind ions backstreaming
from the bow shock. Since July 2004, the Cassini spacecraft has characterized
the Saturnian plasma environment including its upstream region. Since Cassini's
Saturn orbit insertion (SOI) in June 2004 through August 2005, we conducted a
detailed survey and analysis of observations made by the Vector Helium
Magnetometer (VHM). The purpose of the present study is to characterize the
properties of waves observed in Saturn's ULF wave foreshock and identify its
boundary using single spacecraft techniques. The amplitude of these waves is
usually comparable to the mean magnetic field intensity, while their
frequencies in the spacecraft frame yields two clearly differentiated types of
waves: one with frequencies below the local proton cyclotron frequency (\Omega
H+) and another with frequencies above \Omega H+. All the wave crossings
described here, clearly show that these waves are associated to Saturn's
foreshock. In particular, the presence of waves is associated with the change
in \theta Bn to quasi-parallel geometries. Our results show the existence of a
clear boundary for Saturn's ULF wave foreshock, compatible with \theta Bn =

variety of materials in which molecular networks provide rigidity. Here we
present a theoretical framework to study the glassy behavior of both passive
and active network materials. We construct a general microscopic network model
that incorporates nonlinear elasticity of individual filaments and steric
constraints due to crowding. Based on constructive analogies between structural
glass forming liquids and random field Ising magnets implemented using a
heterogeneous self-consistent phonon method, our scheme provides a microscopic
approach to determine the mismatch surface tension and the configurational
entropy, which compete in determining the barrier for structural rearrangements
within the random first order transition theory of escape from a local energy
minimum. The influence of crosslinking on the fragility of inorganic network
glass formers is recapitulated by the model. For active network materials, the
mapping, which correlates the glassy characteristics to the network
architecture and properties of nonequilibrium motor processes, is shown to
capture several key experimental observations on the cytoskeleton of living
cells: Highly connected tense networks behave as strong glass formers; intense
motor action promotes reconfiguration. The fact that our model assuming a
negative motor susceptibility predicts the latter suggests that on average the
motorized processes in living cells do resist the imposed mechanical load. Our
calculations also identify a spinodal point where simultaneously the mismatch
penalty vanishes and the mechanical stability of amorphous packing disappears.

were defined on the basis of portals' characteristics since a mapping was
conducted between the most significant functions and features of Web portals
and quality constructs. The developed framework is deemed useful for theory and
practice. From theoretical perspective, the dimensions that affect the
perceived quality of Web portals are identified, and the measures that affect
each quality dimension are also defined. On the practical level, contributions
gained by this study can be observed in terms of the benefits decision makers,
strategists, operational employees and IT developers can gain. Assessing
portals success in improving task innovation is important to help managers
(i.e. decision makers) in making appropriate decisions concerning the adoption
of portals' technology, by weighing its benefits against the costs needed to
establish and run such a technology. Moreover, assessing Web portals' success
gives some insight to IT developers and designers concerning what aspects
should be taken when designing and establishing high quality portals, and what
functions and features should be contained that would affect the perceived
quality of portals and therefore users' intention to use portals.

two dimensional domains for electrostatics. It can handle Dirichlet, Neumann or
mixed boundary problems in which the filling media can be homogeneous or
inhomogeneous. The basic idea of the new method is solve the problem in three
steps: (i) First solve the equation $\nabla\cdot\mathbf D=\rho$. The inverse of
the divergence operator in a restricted subspace is found to yield the electric
flux density $\mathbf D$ by a fast direct solver in O(N) operations. The
$\mathbf D$ so obtained is nonunique with indeterminate divergence-free
component. Then the electric field is found by $\mathbf E=\mathbf D/\epsilon$.
But $\nabla\times\mathbf E=0$ for electrostatic field; hence, $\mathbf E$ is
curl free and orthogonal to the divergence free space. (ii) An
orthogonalization process is used to purify the electric field making it curl
free and unique. (iii) Then the potential $\phi$ is obtained by solving $\nabla
\phi=-\mathbf E$ or finding the inverse of the gradient operator in a
restricted subspace by a similar fast direct solver in O(N) operations.
Treatments for both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are addressed.
Finally, the validation and efficiency are illustrated by several numerical
examples. Through these simulations, it is observed that the computational
complexity of our proposed method almost scales as O(N) where N is the triangle
patch number of meshes. Consequently, this new algorithm is a feasible fast
Poisson solver.

graph-based interference models. In this paper we study the link scheduling
problem using a more realistic physical interference model. Through some key
observations about this model, we develop efficient link scheduling algorithms
by exploiting the intrinsic connections between the physical interference model
and the graph-based interference model. For one variant of the problem where
each node can dynamically adjust its transmission power, we design a scheduling
method with O(g(E)) approximation to the optimal throughput capacity where g(E)
denotes length diversity. For the other variant where each node has a fixed but
possible different transmission powers for different nodes, we design a method
with O(g(E))-approximation ratio when the transmission powers of all nodes are
within a constant factor of each other, and in general with an approximation
ratio of O(g(E)log\rho) where log\rho is power diversity.
  We further prove that our algorithm for fixed transmission power case retains
O(g(E)) approximation for any length-monotone, sub-linear fixed power setting.
Furthermore, all these approximation factors are independent of network size.

it was in its pre-outburst state, and in November, during the main 12 yr cycle
outburst. The wavelength coverage was from radio to X-rays. In the
optical-to-UV range the differential spectrum between the observations has a
bremsstrahlung spectral shape, consistent with gas at $3 \times 10^{5}K$
temperature. Our result supports the hydrogen column density of the OJ287 host
galaxy of $\sim9.3\times 10^{20} cm^{-2}$, the average value found by Gosh &
Soundararajaperumal. The $3 \times 10^{5}K$ bremsstrahlung radiation was
predicted in the binary black hole model of OJ287, and it arises from a hot
bubble of gas which is torn off the accretion disc by the impact of the
secondary. As this radiation is not Doppler boosted, the brightness of the
outburst provides an estimate for the mass of the secondary black hole,
$\sim1.4\times10^{8}$ solar mass. In order to estimate the mass of the primary
black hole, we ask what is the minimum mass ratio in a binary system which
allows the stability of the accretion disc. By using particle simulations, we
find that the ratio is $\sim1.3\times10^{2}$. This makes the minimum mass of
the primary $\sim1.8\times10^{10}$ solar mass, in agreement with the mass
determined from the orbit solution, $1.84 \times 10^{10}$ solar mass. With this
mass value and the measured K-magnitude of the bulge of the host galaxy of
OJ287, the system lies almost exactly on the previously established correlation
in the black hole mass vs. K-magnitude diagramme. It supports the extension of
this correlation to brighter magnitudes and to more massive black holes than
has been done previously.

$M_E(N):= \#\{p: \#E(\mathbb F_p)= N\}$. Recently, David and the third author
studied the average of $M_E(N)$ over certain ""boxes"" of elliptic curves $E$.
Assuming a plausible conjecture about primes in short intervals, they showed
the following: for odd $N$, the average of $M_E(N)$ over a box with
sufficiently large sides is $\sim \frac{K^{\ast}(N)}{\log{N}}$ for an
explicitly-given function $K^{\ast}(N)$.
  The function $K^{\ast}(N)$ is somewhat peculiar: defined as a product over
the primes dividing $N$, it resembles a multiplicative function at first
glance. But further inspection reveals that it is not, and so one cannot
directly investigate its properties by the usual tools of multiplicative number
theory. In this paper, we overcome these difficulties and prove a number of
statistical results about $K^{\ast}(N)$. For example, we determine the mean
value of $K^{\ast}(N)$ over all $N$, odd $N$ and prime $N$, and we show that
$K^{\ast}(N)$ has a distribution function. We also explain how our results
relate to existing theorems and conjectures on the multiplicative properties of

spectrums have been also observed in resting state fMRI time series. To explain
the fractal behavior in rs-fMRI, we have proposed the fractal-based model of
resting state hemodynamic response function (rs-HRF) whose properties can be
summarized by a fractal exponent. Here we show, through a simulation studies,
that the fractal behavior of cerebral hemodynamics may cause significant
distortion of network properties between neuronal activities and BOLD signals.
We simulated neuronal population activities based on the stochastic neural
field model from the Macaque brain network, and then obtained their
corresponding BOLD signals by convolving them with the rs-HRF filter. The
precision of centrality estimated in each node was deteriorated overall in
three networks based on transfer entropy, mutual information, and Pearson
correlation; particularly the distortion of transfer entropy was more sensitive
to the standard deviation of fractal exponents. A node with high centrality was
resilient to desynchronized fractal dynamics over all frequencies while a node
with small centrality exhibited huge distortion of both wavelet correlation and
centrality over low frequencies. This theoretical expectation indicates that
the difference of fractal exponents between brain regions leads to discrepancy
of statistical network properties, especially at nodes with small centrality,
between neuronal activities and BOLD signals, and that the traditional
definitions of resting state functional connectivity may not effectively
reflect the dynamics of spontaneous neuronal activities.

different propagation speeds between their blue and red shifted parts, a
feature possibly associated with the central engine or the environment in which
the jet propagates. In order to understand the origin of asymmetric YSO jet
velocities, we investigate the efficiency of two candidate mechanisms, one
based on the intrinsic properties of the system and one based on the role of
the external medium. In particular, a parallel or anti-parallel configuration
between the protostellar magnetosphere and the disk magnetic field is
considered and the resulting dynamics are examined both in an ideal and a
resistive magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) regime. Moreover, we explore the effects
of a potential difference in the pressure of the environment, as a consequence
of the non-uniform density distribution of molecular clouds. Ideal and
resistive axisymmetric numerical simulations are carried out for a variety of
models, all of which are based on a combination of two analytical solutions, a
disk wind and a stellar outflow. We find that jet velocity asymmetries can
indeed occur both when multipolar magnetic moments are present in the star-disk
system as well as when non-uniform environments are considered. The latter case
is an external mechanism that can easily explain the large time scale of the
phenomenon, whereas the former one naturally relates it to the YSO intrinsic
properties. [abridged]

0.08 and 0.12) compounds by means of dc and ac magnetic susceptibilities,
electrical resistivity and specific heat measurements. Eu0.5K0.5Fe2As2 is known
to exhibit superconductivity with superconducting transition temperature Tc as
high as 33 K. The Ni-doping leads to a rapid decrease in Tc; Tc is reduced to
23 K with 3% Ni-doping, and 8% Ni-doping suppresses the superconductivity to
below 1.8 K. In 3% Ni-doped sample Eu0.5K0.5(Fe0.97Ni0.03)2As2
superconductivity coexists with short range ordering of Eu2+ magnetic moments
at Tm ~ 6 K. The suppression of superconductivity with Ni-doping is accompanied
with the emergence of a long range antiferromagnetic ordering with TN = 8.5 K
and 7 K for Eu0.5K0.5(Fe0.92Ni0.08)2As2 and Eu0.5K0.5(Fe0.88Ni0.12)2As2,
respectively. The temperature and field dependent magnetic measurements for x =
0.08 and 0.12 samples reflect the possibility of a helical magnetic ordering of
Eu2 moments. We suspect that the helimagnetism of Eu spins could be responsible
for the destruction of superconductivity as has been observed in Co-doped
EuFe2As2. The most striking feature seen in the resistivity data for x = 0.08
is the reappearance of the anomaly presumably due to spin density wave
transition at around 60 K. This could be attributed to the compensation of
holes (K-doping at Eu-site) by the electrons (Ni-doping at Fe site). The
anomaly associated with spin density wave further shifts to 200 K for x = 0.12
for which the electron doping has almost compensated the holes in the system.

of the radiation temperature of the target surface, the coating growth rate and
the density of negative current on the substrate. It was shown that the

radiation-induced modification and heating of the target. The transitional
stage is characterized by nonstationary sublimation of the target material
through the pores in the modified surface layer and release of the accumulated
negative charge. Stabilization of the process parameters owing to the
convection cooling of the target by the sublimation products and the decrease

presented in Laine et al. (2008) by considering more realistic interior
structures, stellar obliquity, and the resulting orbital evolution. In this
simplified approach, the young hot Jupiter of one Jupiter mass is modelled as a
diamagnetic sphere with a finite resistivity, orbiting across tilted stellar
magnetic dipole fields in vacuum. Since the induced Ohmic dissipation occurs
mostly near the planet's surface, we find that the dissipation is unable to
significantly expand the young hot Jupiter. Nevertheless, the planet inside a
small co-rotation orbital radius can undergo orbital decay by the dissipation
torque and finally overfill its Roche lobe during the T Tauri star phase. The
stellar obliquity can evolve significantly if the magnetic dipole is
parallel/anti-parallel to the stellar spin. Our results are validated by the
general torque-dissipation relation in the presence of the stellar obliquity.
We also run the fiducial model in Laine et al. (2008) and find that the
planet's radius is sustained at a nearly constant value by the Ohmic heating,
rather than being thermally expanded to the Roche radius as suggested by the
authors.

complete calculation of such corrections for K to pi bar{nu} nu decays, we find
a scheme in which NLO electroweak corrections are likely to be negligible.
Second, we address the issue of the correspondence between the initial and the
final state detected by the experiments, and those used in the theoretical
prediction. Particular attention is devoted to the effect of the soft
radiation, that has not been discussed for this mode in the previous
literature, and that can lead to O(10%) corrections to the decay rate. The
""non-radiative"" branching ratio (that is equivalent to the branching ratio
fully inclusive of bremsstrahlung radiation) is estimated to be (3.23 +/- 0.27)
x 10^{-9} for the flavor eigenstate, with the main uncertainty resulting from
the value of f_{Bs}, followed by the uncertainty due to higher order
electroweak corrections. Applying the same strategy to Bd to mu+ mu-, we find
for its non-radiative branching ratio (1.07 +/- 0.10) x 10^{-10}.

described at micro-and mesoscopic levels. The particles reproduce themselves at
distant points (dispersal) and die, independently and under the influence of
each other (competition). The microscopic description is based on an infinite
chain of equations for correlation functions, similar to the BBGKY hierarchy
used in the Hamiltonian dynamics of continuum particle systems. The mesoscopic
description is based on a Vlasov-type kinetic equation for the particle's
density obtained from the mentioned chain via a scaling procedure. The main
conclusion of the microscopic theory is that the competition can prevent the
system from clustering, which makes its description in terms of densities
reasonable. A possible homogenization of the solutions to the kinetic equation
in the long-time limit is also discussed.

results of the second order correlation functions, we analyze the quantum
statistics behaviors of the out-going photons for two different cases: (a) the
ideal case without the inter-modal coupling in the whispering gallery
resonator; (b) the case in the presence of the inter-modal coupling which leads
to more complex nonlinear behavior. In the ideal case, we show that the system
consists of two independent scattering pathways, a free pathway by a cavity
mode without atomic excitation, and a ""Jaynes-Cummings"" pathway described by
the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian of a single-mode cavity coupling to an atom.
The free pathway does not contribution to correlated two-photon processes. In
the presence of intermodal mixing, the system no longer exhibit a free resonant
pathway. Instead, both the single-photon and the two photon transport
properties depend on the position of the atom. Thus, in the presence of
intermodal mixing one can in fact tune the photon correlation properties by
changing the position of the atom. Our formalism can be used to treat resonator

produced by cosmic rays above 10^17 eV. During clear nights with a low
illuminated moon fraction, the UV fluorescence light produced by air showers is
recorded by optical telescopes at the Observatory. To correct the observations
for variations in atmospheric conditions, atmospheric monitoring is performed
at regular intervals ranging from several minutes (for cloud identification) to
several hours (for aerosol conditions) to several days (for vertical profiles
of temperature, pressure, and humidity). In 2009, the monitoring program was
upgraded to allow for additional targeted measurements of atmospheric
conditions shortly after the detection of air showers of special interest,
e.g., showers produced by very high-energy cosmic rays or showers with atypical
longitudinal profiles. The former events are of particular importance for the
determination of the energy scale of the Observatory, and the latter are
characteristic of unusual air shower physics or exotic primary particle types.
The purpose of targeted (or ""rapid"") monitoring is to improve the resolution of
the atmospheric measurements for such events. In this paper, we report on the
implementation of the rapid monitoring program and its current status. The
rapid monitoring data have been analyzed and applied to the reconstruction of
air showers of high interest, and indicate that the air fluorescence
measurements affected by clouds and aerosols are effectively corrected using
measurements from the regular atmospheric monitoring program. We find that the
rapid monitoring program has potential for supporting dedicated physics
analyses beyond the standard event reconstruction.
