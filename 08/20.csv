approximations to the discrete cell-level equations are used to maintain
computational tractability. One of the most commonly used models is represented
by the bidomain equations, the derivation of which relies on a homogenisation
technique to construct a suitable approximation to the discrete model. This
derivation does not explicitly account for the presence of gap junctions
connecting one cell to another. It has been seen experimentally [Rohr,
Cardiovasc. Res. 2004] that these gap junctions have a marked effect on the
propagation of the action potential, specifically as the upstroke of the wave
passes through the gap junction.
  In this paper we explicitly include gap junctions in a both a 2D discrete
model of cardiac electrophysiology, and the corresponding continuum model, on a
simplified cell geometry. Using these models we compare the results of
simulations using both continuum and discrete systems. We see that the form of
the action potential as it passes through gap junctions cannot be replicated
using a continuum model, and that the underlying propagation speed of the
action potential ceases to match up between models when gap junctions are
introduced. In addition, the results of the discrete simulations match the
characteristics of those shown in Rohr 2004. From this, we suggest that a
hybrid model -- a discrete system following the upstroke of the action
potential, and a continuum system elsewhere -- may give a more accurate
description of cardiac electrophysiology.

co-presence of multiple spatio-temporal scales. So, tumor cells ecologically
interplay with other kind of cells, e.g. endothelial cells or immune system
effectors, producing and exchanging various chemical signals. As such, tumor
growth is an ideal object of hybrid modeling where discrete stochastic
processes model agents at low concentrations, and mean-field equations model
chemical signals. In previous works we proposed a hybrid version of the
well-known Panetta-Kirschner mean-field model of tumor cells, effector cells
and Interleukin-2. Our hybrid model suggested -at variance of the inferences
from its original formulation- that immune surveillance, i.e. tumor elimination
by the immune system, may occur through a sort of side-effect of large
stochastic oscillations. However, that model did not account that, due to both
chemical transportation and cellular differentiation/division, the
tumor-induced recruitment of immune effectors is not instantaneous but,
instead, it exhibits a lag period. To capture this, we here integrate a
mean-field equation for Interleukins-2 with a bi-dimensional delayed stochastic
process describing such delayed interplay. An algorithm to realize trajectories
of the underlying stochastic process is obtained by coupling the Piecewise
Deterministic Markov process (for the hybrid part) with a Generalized
Semi-Markovian clock structure (to account for delays). We (i) relate tumor
mass growth with delays via simulations and via parametric sensitivity analysis
techniques, (ii) we quantitatively determine probabilistic eradication times,
and (iii) we prove, in the oscillatory regime, the existence of a heuristic
stochastic bifurcation resulting in delay-induced tumor eradication, which is
neither predicted by the mean-field nor by the hybrid non-delayed models.

progression of cancers through discrete phenotypes. The classification of
cancer progression using discrete states like stages and hallmarks has become
common in the biology literature, but primarily as an organizing principle, and
not as an executable formalism. The precise computational model developed here
aims to exploit this untapped potential, namely, through automatic verification
of progression models (e.g., consistency, causal connections, etc.),
classification of unreachable or unstable states and computer-generated
(individualized or universal) therapy plans. The paper builds on a
phenomenological approach, and as such does not need to assume a model for the
biochemistry of the underlying natural progression. Rather, it abstractly
models transition timings between states as well as the effects of drugs and
clinical tests, and thus allows formalization of temporal statements about the
progression as well as notions of timed therapies. The model proposed here is
ultimately based on hybrid automata, and we show how existing controller
synthesis algorithms can be generalized to CHA models, so that therapies can be
generated automatically. Throughout this paper we use cancer hallmarks to
represent the discrete states through which cancer progresses, but other
notions of discretely or continuously varying state formalisms could also be
used to derive similar therapies.

nu_d of electrons in the trapping region of velocity space must exceed the
bounce period of deeply-trapped electrons, tau_B = (n_e/delta n)^{1/2}
2pi/omega_pe. A unitless figure of merit, the ""bounce number"" N_B = 1/(nu_d
tau_B), encapsulates this condition and defines a trapping threshold amplitude
for which N_B=1. The detrapping rate is found for convective loss (transverse
and longitudinal) out of a spatially finite Langmuir wave. Simulations of
driven waves with a finite transverse profile, using the 2D-2V Vlasov code
Loki, show trapping nonlinearity increases continuously with N_B for transverse
loss, and is significant for N_B ~ 1. The detrapping rate due to Coulomb
collisions (both electron-electron and electron-ion) is also found, with
pitch-angle scattering and parallel drag and diffusion treated in a unified
manner. A simple way to combine convective and collisional detrapping is given.
Application to underdense plasma conditions in inertial confinement fusion
targets is presented. The results show that convective transverse loss is
usually the most potent detrapping process in a single f/8 laser speckle. For
typical plasma and laser conditions on the inner laser cones of the National
Ignition Facility, local reflectivities ~3% are estimated to produce
significant trapping effects.

surrounded concentrically by a pure-water ion-exclusion layer and then a dilute
electrolyte (modeled with the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation). Our main

in a protein embedded in a nonlocal-dielectric solvent, the Lorentz model
studied by Dogonadze and Kornyshev. The analytical method enables biophysicists
to study the new nonlocal theory in a simple, computationally fast way; an
open-source MATLAB implementation is included as supplemental information.

is the main focus of this thesis. We have found certain symmetries that are
always broken in models with more than two doublets, which we name ""frustrated
symmetries"". In the attempt towards the classification of possible symmetries
in the scalar sector of the NHDM, we find that these symmetry groups are either
subgroups of the maximal torus, or certain finite Abelian groups which are not
subgroups of maximal tori. For the subgroups of the maximal torus, we present
an algorithmic strategy that gives the full list of possible realizable Abelian
symmetries for any given $N$. We extend this strategy to include Abelian
antiunitary symmetries (with generalized CP transformations) in NHDM. We also
show that multi-Higgs-doublet models can naturally accommodate scalar dark
matter candidates protected by the group $\Z_p$, since these groups are
realizable in NHDM. These models do not require any significant fine-tuning and
can lead to a variety of forms of microscopic dynamics among the dark matter
candidates.

is known to undergo pulse nulling, using an 153-d intensive sequence of
observations. The pulsar is found to exhibit both short (~min) and unusually
long-term (~hours or more) nulls, which not only suggest that the source
possesses a distribution of nulling timescales, but that it may also provide a
link between conventional nulling pulsars and longer-term intermittent pulsars.
Despite seeing evidence for periodicities in the pulsar radio emission, we are
uncertain whether they are intrinsic to the source, due to the influence of
observation sampling on the periodicity analysis performed. Remarkably, we find
evidence to suggest that the pulsar may undergo pre-ignition periods of
'emission flickering', that is rapid changes between radio-on (active) and -off
(null) emission states, before transitioning to a steady radio-emitting phase.
We find no direct evidence to indicate that the object exhibits any change in
spin-down rate between its radio-on and -off emission modes. We do, however,
place an upper limit on this variation to be <= 6 % from simulations. This
indicates that emission cessation in pulsars does not necessarily lead to large
changes in spin-down rate. Moreover, we show that such changes in spin-down
rate will not be discernible in the majority of objects which exhibit
short-term (<= 1 d) emission cessation. In light of this, we predict that many
pulsars could exhibit similar magnetospheric and emission properties to PSR
B0823+26, but which have not yet been observed.

opportunistic communication in Delay Tolerant Networks. Even if this technique

to avoid useless transmissions, it has been proposed to ask nodes to exchange

filter has been proposed to transport the buffer content information, up to our

exists in practice. In this paper we describe an implementation of an epidemic
forwarding scheme using Bloom filters. Then we propose some strategies for
Bloom filter management based on windowing and describe implementation
tradeoffs. By simulating our proposed strategies in ns-3 both with random

of a scalar field provides the missing corner stone for the standard model of
particles (SM). However, the SM fails to explain the non-visible but
gravitationally active part of the universe. Its nature is unknown but the
confirmation of a scalar Higgs is giving a boost to scalar-field-theories. So
far gravity experiments and observations performed at different distances find
no deviation from Newton's gravity law. Therefore dark energy must possess a
screening mechanism which suppresses the scalar-mediated fifth force. Our line
of attack is a novel gravity experiment with neutrons based on a quantum
interference technique. The spectroscopic measurement of quantum states on
resonances with an external coupling makes this a powerful search for dark
matter and dark energy contributions in the universe. Quantum states in the
gravity potential are intimately related to other scalar field or spin-0-bosons
if they exist. If the reason is that some undiscovered particle interact with a
neutron, this results in a measurable energy shift of quantum states in the
gravity potential, because for neutrons the screening effect is absent. We use
Gravity Resonance Spectroscopy to measure the energy splitting at the highest
level of precision, providing a constraint on any possible new interaction. We
obtain a sensitivity of 10^-14 eV. We set an experimental limit on any fifth
force, in particular on parameter \beta<2x10^9 at n=3 for the scalar chameleon
field, which is improved by a factor of 100 compared to our previous experiment
and five orders of magnitude better than from precision tests of atomic
spectra. The pseudoscalar axion coupling is constrained to gsgp/\hbar
c<3x10^-16 at 20\mu m, which is an improvement by a factor of 30. These results

returned by the website, often according to a proprietary ranking function.
Since most web database owners set k to be a small value, the top-k output
constraint prevents many interesting third-party (e.g., mashup) services from
being developed over real-world web databases. In this paper we consider the
novel problem of ""digging deeper"" into such web databases. Our main
contribution is the meta-algorithm GetNext that can retrieve the next ranked

ideal opportunities to examine evolution through hybridization. For example,
maize and the conspecific wild teosinte Zea mays ssp. mexicana, (hereafter,
mexicana) are known to hybridize in the fields of highland Mexico. Despite
widespread evidence of gene flow, maize and mexicana maintain distinct
morphologies and have done so in sympatry for thousands of years. Neither the
genomic extent nor the evolutionary importance of introgression between these
taxa is understood. In this study we assessed patterns of genome-wide
introgression based on 39,029 single nucleotide polymorphisms genotyped in 189
individuals from nine sympatric maize-mexicana populations and reference
allopatric populations. While portions of the maize and mexicana genomes were
particularly resistant to introgression (notably near known
cross-incompatibility and domestication loci), we detected widespread evidence
for introgression in both directions of gene flow. Through further
characterization of these regions and preliminary growth chamber experiments,
we found evidence suggestive of the incorporation of adaptive mexicana alleles
into maize during its expansion to the highlands of central Mexico. In
contrast, very little evidence was found for adaptive introgression from maize
to mexicana. The methods we have applied here can be replicated widely, and
such analyses have the potential to greatly informing our understanding of
evolution through introgressive hybridization. Crop species, due to their
exceptional genomic resources and frequent histories of spread into sympatry
with relatives, should be particularly influential in these studies.

link between the presence of exoplanets around various types of stars and to
understand the respective evolution of stars and exoplanets.
  Using the limb-darkened diameter (LDD) obtained from interferometric data, we
determine the fundamental parameters of four exoplanet host stars. We are
particularly interested in the F4 main-sequence star, {\theta} Cyg, for which
Kepler has recently revealed solar-like oscillations that are unexpected for
this type of star. Furthermore, recent photometric and spectroscopic
measurements with SOPHIE and ELODIE (OHP) show evidence of a quasi-periodic
radial velocity of \sim150 days. Models of this periodic change in radial
velocity predict either a complex planetary system orbiting the star, or a new
and unidentified stellar pulsation mode.
  We performed interferometric observations of {\theta} Cyg, 14 Andromedae,
{\upsilon} Andromedae and 42 Draconis for two years with VEGA/CHARA (Mount
Wilson, California) in several three-telescope configurations. We measured
accurate limb darkened diameters and derived their radius, mass and temperature
using empirical laws.
  We obtain new accurate fundamental parameters for stars 14 And, {\upsilon}
And and 42 Dra. We also obtained limb darkened diameters with a minimum
precision of \sim 1.3%, leading to minimum planet masses of Msini=5.33\pm 0.57,
0.62 \pm 0.09 and 3.79\pm0.29 MJup for 14 And b, {\upsilon} And b and 42 Dra b,
respectively. The interferometric measurements of {\theta} Cyg show a
significant diameter variability that remains unexplained up to now. We propose
that the presence of these discrepancies in the interferometric data is caused
by either an intrinsic variation of the star or an unknown close companion
orbiting around it.

Age-Metallicity Relationship (AMR) from the earliest epoch until ~1 Gyr ago.
This AMR reveals that the LMC has not evolved chemically as either a closed-box
or bursting system, exclusively, but as a combination of both scenarios that
have varied in relative strength over the lifetime of the galaxy, although the
bursting model falls closer to the data in general. Furthermore, while old and
metal-poor field stars have been preferentially formed in the outer disk,
younger and more metal-rich stars have mostly been formed in the inner disk,
confirming an outside-in formation. We provide evidence for the formation of
stars between 5 and 12 Gyr, during the cluster age gap, although chemical
enrichment during this period was minimal. We find no significant metallicity
gradient in the LMC. We also find that the range in the metallicity of an LMC
field has varied during the lifetime of the LMC. In particular, we find only a
small range of the metal abundance in the outer disk fields, whereas an average
range of Delta([Fe/H]) = +0.3\pm0.1 dex appears in the inner disk fields.

Monte- Carlo simulations including the sphere of influence resolution selection

the sphere of influence selection bias has a significant effect on the measured
slope of the M-sigma relation, modeled as \beta_intrinsic = -4.69 +
2.22\beta_measured, where the measured slope is shallower than the model slope
in the parameter range of \beta > 4, with larger corrections for steeper model
slopes. Therefore, when the sphere of influence is used as a criterion to
exclude unreliable measurements, it also in- troduces a selection bias that
needs to be modeled to restore the intrinsic slope of the relation. We find
that the selection effect due to the velocity dispersion distribution of the
sample, which might not follow the overall distribution of the population, is
not important for slopes of \beta ~ 4-6 of a logarithmically linear M-sigma
relation, which could impact some studies that measure low (e.g., \beta < 4)
slopes. Combining the selection biases in velocity dispersions and the sphere
of influence cut, we find the uncertainty of the slope is larger than the value
without modeling these effects, and estimate an intrinsic slope of \beta =
5.28^{+0.84}_{-0.55}.

similar sum rules for the Fermi-Hubbard model, in the Bose-Hubbard model case,
the sum rules often depend on expectation values that cannot be determined

both for the promise of such systems as astrophysical sources of gravitational

problem. Our understanding of this problem has advanced significantly in recent
years, with much progress in modeling the ""self force"" arising from the small
body's interaction with its own spacetime deformation. Recent work has shown
that this self interaction is especially interesting when the frequencies
associated with the orbit's $\theta$ and $r$ motions are in an integer ratio:
$\Omega_\theta/\Omega_r = \beta_\theta/\beta_r$, with $\beta_\theta$ and

models is introduced. In the context of ordered qubit registers this scheme
finds a natural translation in terms of global operations, and single particle
measurements on the edge of the array. Two applications of this scheme are
presented. First, through appropriate Wick rotations, those amplitudes can be
analytically continued to yield estimates for partition functions of Ising
models. Bounds on the estimation error, valid with high confidence, are
provided through a central-limit theorem, which validity extends beyond the
present context. It holds for example for estimations of the Jones polynomial.
Interestingly, the kind of state preparations and measurements involved in this
application can in principle be made ""instantaneous"", i.e. independent of the
system size or the parameters being simulated. Second, the scheme allows to
accurately estimate some non-trivial invariants of links. A third result
concerns the computational power of estimations of partition functions for real
temperature classical ferromagnetic Ising models on a square lattice. We
provide conditions under which estimating such partition functions allows one
to reconstruct scattering amplitudes of quantum circuits making the problem
BQP-hard. Using this mapping, we show that fidelity overlaps for ground states
of quantum Hamiltonians, which serve as a witness to quantum phase transitions,
can be estimated from classical Ising model partition functions. Finally, we
show that the ability to accurately measure corner magnetizations on thermal
states of two-dimensional Ising models with magnetic field leads to fully
polynomial random approximation schemes (FPRAS) for the partition function.
Each of these results corresponds to a section of the text that can be
essentially read independently.

algorithms have been extensively demonstrated in the context of matrix product
states (MPSs). These include the ability to select a specific symmetry sector
(e.g. with a given particle number or spin), to ensure the exact preservation
of total charge, and to significantly reduce computational costs. Compared to
the case of a generic tensor network, the practical implementation of
symmetries in the MPS is simplified by the fact that tensors only have three
indices (they are trivalent, just as the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients of the
symmetry group) and are organized as a one-dimensional array of tensors,
without closed loops. Instead, a more complex tensor network, one where tensors
have a larger number of indices and/or a more elaborate network structure,
requires a more general treatment. In two recent papers, namely (i) [Phys. Rev.
A 82, 050301 (2010)] and (ii) [Phys. Rev. B 83, 115125 (2011)], we described
how to incorporate a global internal symmetry into a generic tensor network
algorithm based on decomposing and manipulating tensors that are invariant
under the symmetry. In (i) we considered a generic symmetry group G that is
compact, completely reducible and multiplicity free, acting as a global
internal symmetry. Then in (ii) we described the practical implementation of
Abelian group symmetries. In this paper we describe the implementation of
non-Abelian group symmetries in great detail and for concreteness consider an
SU(2) symmetry. Our formalism can be readily extended to more exotic symmetries
associated with conservation of total fermionic or anyonic charge. As a
practical demonstration, we describe the SU(2)-invariant version of the
multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz and apply it to study the low
energy spectrum of a quantum spin chain with a global SU(2) symmetry.

separable functions subject to linear constraints. Previous analysis of the
ADMM typically assumes that the objective function is the sum of only two
convex functions defined on two separable blocks of variables even though the
algorithm works well in numerical experiments for three or more blocks.
Moreover, there has been no rate of convergence analysis for the ADMM without
strong convexity in the objective function. In this paper we establish the
global linear convergence of the ADMM for minimizing the sum of any number of
convex separable functions. This result settles a key question regarding the
convergence of the ADMM when the number of blocks is more than two or if the
strong convexity is absent. It also implies the linear convergence of the ADMM
for several contemporary applications including LASSO, Group LASSO and Sparse
Group LASSO without any strong convexity assumption. Our proof is based on
estimating the distance from a dual feasible solution to the optimal dual
solution set by the norm of a certain proximal residual, and by requiring the
dual stepsize to be sufficiently small.

function was shown to provide an incommensurate low-frequency response with
hole dispersions derived from photoemission. The theory reproduces the
hourglass dispersion of the susceptibility maxima with the upper branch
reflecting the dispersion of localized spin excitations and the lower branch
being due to incommensurate maxima of their damping. The intensive resonance
peak appears when the hourglass waist falls below the bottom of the
electron-hole continuum. In the pseudogap phase, the Fermi arcs lead to a
quasi-elastic incommensurate response for low temperatures. This result
explains the lack of the superconducting gap in the susceptibility of
phase-separated underdoped lanthanum cuprates. It may also explain the
strengthening of the quasi-elastic response by magnetic fields and impurities.

stochastic molecular events involving gene choices and random nucleotide
insertions between, and deletions from, genes. We use large sequence
repertoires of the variable CDR3 region of human CD4+ T-cell receptor beta
chains to infer the statistical properties of these basic biochemical events.
Since any given CDR3 sequence can be produced in multiple ways, the probability
distribution of hidden recombination events cannot be inferred directly from
the observed sequences; we therefore develop a maximum likelihood inference
method to achieve this end. To separate the properties of the molecular
rearrangement mechanism from the effects of selection, we focus on
non-productive CDR3 sequences in T-cell DNA. We infer the joint distribution of
the various generative events that occur when a new T-cell receptor gene is
created. We find a rich picture of correlation (and absence thereof), providing
insight into the molecular mechanisms involved. The generative event statistics
are consistent between individuals, suggesting a universal biochemical process.
Our distribution predicts the generation probability of any specific CDR3
sequence by the primitive recombination process, allowing us to quantify the
potential diversity of the T-cell repertoire and to understand why some
sequences are shared between individuals. We argue that the use of formal
statistical inference methods, of the kind presented in this paper, will be
essential for quantitative understanding of the generation and evolution of
diversity in the adaptive immune system.

Numpy and Scipy, and which has Python as its command language. We review

fluid phase of hard convex particle systems but fails beyond the freezing
point. The reason for this limitation is the neglect of orientational and
distance correlations beyond the particle diameter. In the current article we
resolve this restriction and generalize the fundamental measure theory to an
expansion in intersection centers. It is shown that the intersection
probability of particle systems is described by an algebra, represented by
Rosenfeld's weight functions. For subdiagrams of intersection networks we
derive vertex functions that provide the building blocks for the free energy
functional. Their application is illustrated by deriving the Rosenfeld
functional and its leading correction which is exact in the third virial order.
Furthermore, the methods are used to derive an approximate functional for the
infinite sum over Mayer ring diagrams. Comparing this result to the White Bear
mark II functional, we find general agreement between both results.

test collection were the very unspecific topics and sparse document
representations. Only half of the topics (26/50) contained a description and
the titles were usually short with just around two words. Therefore we focused
on three different term suggestion and query expansion mechanisms to surpass
the sparse topical description. We used two methods that build on concept
extraction from Wikipedia and on a method that applied co-occurrence statistics
on the available Europeana corpus. In the following paper we will present the
approaches and preliminary results from their assessments.

Many bacteria
are motile: they are capable of self-propulsion. Among these, a significant
class execute so-called run-and-tumble motion: they follow a fairly straight
path for a certain distance, then abruptly change direction before repeating
the process. This dynamics has something in common with Brownian motion (it is
diffusive at large scales), and also something in contrast. Specifically,
motility parameters such as the run speed and tumble rate depend on the local
environment and hence can vary in space. When they do so, even if a steady
state is reached, this is not generally invariant under time-reversal: the
principle of detailed balance, which restores the microscopic time-reversal
symmetry of systems in thermal equilibrium, is mesoscopically absent in motile
bacteria. This lack of detailed balance (allowed by the flux of chemical energy
that drives motility) creates pitfalls for the unwary modeller. Here I review
some statistical mechanical models for bacterial motility, presenting them as a
paradigm for exploring diffusion without detailed balance. I also discuss the
extent to which statistical physics is useful in understanding real or
potential microbiological experiments.

perturbations in cosmologies with generalized expansion histories in the epoch
of cosmic acceleration. Forthcoming satellite and sub-orbital experiments
probing polarization in the CMB are expected to measure the B-mode power in CMB
polarization, coming from PGWs on the degree scale, as well as gravitational
lensing on arcmin scales; the latter is the main competitor for the measurement
of PGWs, and is directly affected by the underlying expansion history,
determined by the presence of a DE component. In particular, we consider early
DE possible scenarios, in which the expansion history is substantially modified
at the epoch in which the CMB lensing is most relevant. We show that the
introduction of a parametrized DE may induce a variation as large as 30% in the
ratio of the power of lensing and PGWs on the degree scale. We find that
adopting the nominal specifications of upcoming satellite measurements the
constraining power on PGWs is weakened by the inclusion of the extra degrees of
freedom, resulting in a reduction of about 10% of the upper limits on r in
fiducial models with no GWs, as well as a comparable increase in the error bars
in models with non-zero r. Moreover, we find that the inclusion of sub-orbital
CMB experiments, capable of mapping the B-mode power up to the angular scales
affected by lensing, can restore the forecasted performances with a
cosmological constant. Finally, we show how the combination of CMB data with
Type Ia SNe, BAO and Hubble constant allows to constrain simultaneously r and
the DE quantities in the parametrization we consider, consisting of present
abundance and first redshift derivative of the energy density. We compare this
study with results obtained using the forecasted lensing potential measurement
precision from CMB satellite observations, finding consistent results.

hydrides along the sight-lines towards W49N and G10.6-0.4 in order to elucidate
the production pathways leading to nitrogen-bearing species in diffuse gas. All
detections show absorption by foreground material over a wide range of
velocities, as well as absorption associated directly with the hot-core source
itself. As in the previously published observations towards G10.6-0.4, the NH,
NH2 and NH3 spectra towards W49N show strikingly similar and non-saturated
absorption features. We decompose the absorption of the foreground material
towards W49N into different velocity components in order to investigate whether
the relative abundances vary among the velocity components, and, in addition,
we re-analyse the absorption lines towards G10.6-0.4 in the same manner.
Abundances, with respect to molecular hydrogen, in each velocity component are
estimated using CH. The analysis points to a co-existence of the nitrogen
hydrides in diffuse or translucent interstellar gas with a high molecular
fraction. Towards both sources, we find that NH is always at least as abundant
as both o-NH2 and o-NH3, in sharp contrast to previous results for dark clouds.
We find relatively constant N(NH)/N(o-NH3) and N(o-NH2)/N(o-NH3) ratios with
mean values of 3.2 and 1.9 towards W49N, and 5.4 and 2.2 towards G10.6-0.4,
respectively. The mean abundance of o-NH3 is ~2x10^-9 towards both sources. The
nitrogen hydrides also show linear correlations with CN and HNC towards both
sources, and looser correlations with CH. The upper limits on the NH+ abundance
indicate column densities < 2 - 14 % of N(NH). Surprisingly low values of the
ammonia ortho-to-para ratio are found in both sources, ~0.5 - 0.7 +- 0.1. This
result cannot be explained by current models as we had expected to find a value
of unity or higher.

A general inner bound is obtained combining rate-splitting, superposition

regime consists of channels in which there is no loss of optimality in having

focusing on the thermal inertia of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). Thermal inertia
governs the Yarkovsky effect, a non-gravitational force which significantly
alters the orbits of asteroids up to \sim 20 km in diameter. Yet, very little
has previously been known about the thermal inertia of small asteroids
including NEAs. Observational and theoretical work is reported. The thermal
emission of asteroids has been observed in the mid-infrared (5-35 {\mu}m)
wavelength range using the Spitzer Space Telescope and the 3.0m IRTF. A
detailed thermophysical model (TPM) has been developed and extensively tested;
this is the first detailed TPM shown to be applicable to NEA data. Our main
result is the determination of the thermal inertia of 5 NEAs, increasing the
total number of NEAs with measured thermal inertia to 6. For two of our
targets, previously available estimates are refined. Our results allow the
first determination of the typical thermal inertia of NEAs, which is around 300
J s^{-1/2} K^{-1} m^{-2}, larger than the typical thermal inertia of large
main-belt asteroids (MBAs) by more than an order of magnitude. In particular,
thermal inertia appears to increase with decreasing asteroid diameter. Our
results have been used by colleagues to estimate the size dependence of the
Yarkovsky effect, thus explaining the apparent difference in the size-frequency
distribution of NEAs and similarly sized MBAs. Thermal inertia is a very
sensitive indicator for the presence or absence of particulate material on the
surface. Our results indicate that even sub-km asteroids are covered with
coarse regolith.

influenced by the decisions of legitimate end users. Getting agents in the
Internet, and in networks in general, to invest in and deploy security features
and protocols is a challenge, in particular because of economic reasons arising
from the presence of network externalities.
  In this paper, we focus on the question of incentive alignment for agents of
a large network towards a better security. We start with an economic model for
a single agent, that determines the optimal amount to invest in protection. The
model takes into account the vulnerability of the agent to a security breach
and the potential loss if a security breach occurs. We derive conditions on the
quality of the protection to ensure that the optimal amount spent on security
is an increasing function of the agent's vulnerability and potential loss. We
also show that for a large class of risks, only a small fraction of the
expected loss should be invested.
  Building on these results, we study a network of interconnected agents
subject to epidemic risks. We derive conditions to ensure that the incentives
of all agents are aligned towards a better security. When agents are strategic,
we show that security investments are always socially inefficient due to the
network externalities. Moreover alignment of incentives typically implies a
coordination problem, leading to an equilibrium with a very high price of
anarchy.

destroyed and bound cluster states formed. We show that this leads to a
pseudogap. Due to weaker coupling to the bath for the anti-nodal point, this
happens first for this point, explaining the k-dependence of the pseudogap. The
pseudogap can be understood in terms of preformed d-wave pairs, but it does not

now, the effect of the voltage rise rate was only studied across a wide range.
Here we show that even slight variations in the voltage rise can have
significant effects. We have studied positive streamer discharges in a 16 cm
point-plane gap in high-purity nitrogen 6.0, created by 25 kV pulses with a
duration of 130 ns. The voltage rise varies by a rise rate from 1.9 kV/ns to
2.7 kV/ns and by the first peak voltage of 22 to 28 kV. A structural link is
found between smaller discharges with a larger inception cloud caused by a
faster rising voltage. This relation is explained by the greater stability of
the inception cloud due to a faster voltage rise, causing a delay in the
destabilisation. Time-resolved measurements show that the inception cloud
propagates slower than an earlier destabilised, more filamentary discharge.
This explains that the discharge with a faster rising voltage pulse ends up to
be shorter. Furthermore, the effect of remaining background ionisation in a
pulse sequence has been studied, showing that channel thickness and branching
rate are locally affected, depending on the covered volume of the previous
discharge.

We carried out a radial-velocity survey to search for planets around
metal-poor stars. In this paper we report the discovery of two planets around
HIP 11952, a metal-poor star with [Fe/H]= -1.9 that belongs to our target
sample. Methods. Radial velocity variations of HIP 11952 were monitored
systematically with FEROS at the 2.2 m telescope located at the ESO La Silla
observatory from August 2009 until January 2011. We used a cross-correlation
technique to measure the stellar radial velocities (RV). Results. We detected a
long-period RV variation of 290 d and a short-period one of 6.95 d. The
spectroscopic analysis of the stellar activity reveals a stellar rotation
period of 4.8 d. The Hipparcos photometry data shows intra-day variabilities,
which give evidence for stellar pulsations. Based on our analysis, the observed
RV variations are most likely caused by the presence of unseen planetary
companions. Assuming a primary mass of 0.83 M\odot, we computed minimum
planetary masses of 0.78 MJup for the inner and 2.93 MJup for the outer planet.
The semi-major axes are a1 = 0.07 AU and a2 = 0.81 AU, respectively.
Conclusions. HIP 11952 is one of very few stars with [Fe/H]< -1.0 which have
planetary companions. This discovery is important to understand planet
formation around metal-poor stars

give results about the existence of a strong local survival regime and we prove
that, unlike local and global survival, in continuous time, strong local
survival is not a monotone property in the general case (though it is monotone
if the branching random walk is quasi transitive). We provide an example of an
irreducible branching random walk where the strong local property depends on
the starting site of the process. By means of other counterexamples we show
that the existence of a pure global phase is not equivalent to nonamenability
of the process, and that even an irreducible branching random walk with the
same branching law at each site may exhibit non-strong local survival. Finally
we show that the generating function of a irreducible BRW can have more than
two fixed points; this disproves a previously known result.

supported on a rational normal curve is a cyclic cover, and we show that if the
branch points are weighted by the GIT linearization and the rational normal

weights as in this attaching map. We find that both GIT polarizations and the
Hodge class for families of cyclic covers yield line bundles on $\bar{M}_{0,n}$

divisorial factorization, abstracting an axiom from rational conformal field
theory, to encode this property and show that it determines the isomorphism

through a solar atmosphere embedded with three different flux tube models which
differ in radius and total magnetic flux. A quiet Sun simulation without a tube
present is also performed as a reference. Waves are excited inside the flux
tube and propagate along the field lines, and jacket modes are generated in the
surroundings of the flux tube, carrying 40% as much energy as the tube modes.
The resulting scattered wave is mainly an f-mode composed of a mixture of m=0

the magnetic flux. A small amount of power is scattered into the p_1-mode. We
have evaluated the absorption and phase shift from a Fourier-Hankel
decomposition of the photospheric vertical velocities. They are compared with
the results obtained from the emsemble average of 3400 small magnetic elements

the observed dependence of the phase shift with wavenumber can be matched
reasonably well with the simulated flux tube model. The observed variation of

clusters selected from the excpres sample, we investigate the optical and X-ray
properties of clusters with respect to their total mass derived from weak
gravitational lensing. From multi-color wide field imaging obtained with
MegaCam at CFHT, we derive the shear profile of each individual cluster of

compared to the X-ray masses obtained from the analysis of XMM observations and
assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. We find a good agreement between the two mass
proxies although a few outliers with either perturbed morphology or poor
quality data prevent to derive robust mass estimates. The weak lensing mass is
also correlated with the optical richness and the total optical luminosity, as
well as with the X-ray luminosity, to provide scaling relations within the
redshift range 0.4<z<0.6. These relations are in good agreement with previous
works at lower redshifts. For the L_X-M relation we combine our sample with two
other cluster and group samples from the literature, thus covering two decades

reals), it is known that both problems are PTIME decidable. However, when they
range over the integers, whether for single-path or multipath loops, the
complexity has not yet been determined. We show that both problems are
coNP-complete. However, we point out some special cases of importance of PTIME
complexity. We also present complete algorithms for synthesizing linear and
lexicographical-linear ranking functions, both for the general case and the
special PTIME cases. Moreover, in the rational setting, our algorithm for
synthesizing lexicographical-linear ranking functions extends existing ones,
because our class of ranking functions is more general, yet it has polynomial
time complexity.

quality content has raised the issue of how to rank both resources and users in
online communities. In this paper we develop a general ranking method that can
simultaneously evaluate users' reputation and objects' quality in an iterative
procedure, and that exploits the trust relationships and social acquaintances
of users as an additional source of information. We test our method on two real
online communities, the EconoPhysics forum and the Last.fm music catalogue, and
determine how different variants of the algorithm influence the resultant
ranking. We show the benefits of considering trust relationships, and define
the form of the algorithm better apt to common situations.

  spatial, temporal, networked, and high-dimensional signals'",,"10.1109/JSTSP.2012.2233193",,"cs.NI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the backbone of large-scale networks, origin-to-destination (OD) traffic
flows experience abrupt unusual changes known as traffic volume anomalies,
which can result in congestion and limit the extent to which end-user quality
of service requirements are met. As a means of maintaining seamless end-user
experience in dynamic environments, as well as for ensuring network security,
this paper deals with a crucial network monitoring task termed dynamic
anomalography. Given link traffic measurements (noisy superpositions of
unobserved OD flows) periodically acquired by backbone routers, the goal is to
construct an estimated map of anomalies in real time, and thus summarize the
network `health state' along both the flow and time dimensions. Leveraging the
low intrinsic-dimensionality of OD flows and the sparse nature of anomalies, a
novel online estimator is proposed based on an exponentially-weighted
least-squares criterion regularized with the sparsity-promoting $\ell_1$-norm
of the anomalies, and the nuclear norm of the nominal traffic matrix. After
recasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to online
optimization, a real-time algorithm for dynamic anomalography is developed and
its convergence established under simplifying technical assumptions. For
operational conditions where computational complexity reductions are at a
premium, a lightweight stochastic gradient algorithm based on Nesterov's
acceleration technique is developed as well. Comprehensive numerical tests with
both synthetic and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed online algorithms and their tracking capabilities, and demonstrate
that they outperform state-of-the-art approaches developed to diagnose traffic
anomalies.
