superconductors. The key ingredient of the model is a dynamical mixing of
quasi-degenerate spin states of Fe2+ ion by intersite electron hoppings,
resulting in an effective local spin Seff. The moments Seff tend to form
singlet pairs, and may condense into a spin nematic phase due to the emergent
biquadratic exchange couplings. The long-range ordered part m of Seff varies
widely, 0<=m<=Seff, but magnon spectra are universal and scale with Seff,
resolving the puzzle of large but fluctuating Fe-moments. Unusual temperature
dependences of a local moment and spin susceptibility are also explained.

prove the existence (and uniqueness) of global strong and classical solutions

if the initial mass is small for the fixed coefficients of viscosity and heat

rate of the strong solution are obtained. Finally, we show that the global
strong solution can become classical if the initial data is more regular. Note
that the assumptions on the initial density do not exclude that the initial
density may vanish in a subset of R3 and that it can be of a non trivially

whether the result on unitary similarity remains valid provided that the Weyl

is some non-self-adjoint bounded operator in $\cH$. We specify some conditions
in terms of the operators $A_0$ and $A_B= A^*\lceil \ker(\G_1-B\G_0)$, which
determine uniquely (up to unitary equivalence) the pair ${A,A_B}$ by the Weyl
function $\wt M(\cd)$. Moreover, it is shown that under some additional
assumptions the Weyl function $M_\Pi(\cdot)$ of the boundary triplet $\Pi$ for
the dual pair $\DA$ determines the triplet $\Pi$ uniquely up to unitary

Motivated by the discovery of the Type Ic SN2007bi, we study its proposed

models for primordial ~200Msun stars, simulating the implosion/explosion due to
the pair-production instability, and use them as inputs for detailed non-LTE
time-dependent radiative-transfer simulations that include non-local energy
deposition and non-thermal processes. We retrieve the basic morphology of PISN
light curves from red-supergiant, blue-supergiant, and Wolf-Rayet (WR) star
progenitors. Although we confirm that a progenitor 100Msun helium core (PISN
model He100) fits well the SN2007bi light curve, the low ratios of its kinetic
energy and 56Ni mass to the ejecta mass, similar to standard core-collapse SNe,
conspire to produce cool photospheres, red spectra subject to strong line
blanketing, and narrow line profiles, all conflicting with SN2007bi
observations. He-core models of increasing 56Ni-to-ejecta mass ratio have bluer
spectra, but still too red to match SN2007bi, even for model He125 -- the
effect of 56Ni heating is offset by the associated increase in blanketing. In
contrast, the delayed injection of energy by a magnetar represents a more
attractive alternative to reproduce the blue, weakly-blanketed, and broad-lined
spectra of super-luminous SNe. The extra heat source is free of blanketing and
is not explicitly tied to the ejecta. Experimenting with a ~9Msun WR-star
progenitor, initially exploded to yield a ~1.6B SN Ib/c ejecta but later
influenced by tunable magnetar-like radiation, we produce a diversity of blue
spectral morphologies reminiscent of SN2007bi, the peculiar Type Ib SN2005bf,

expansion around the limit of vanishing baryon, electric charge and strangeness

main motivation is to investigate the effect of helicity-0 mode which remains
elusive after analysis of cosmological perturbation around an open
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. The non-linear form of the
effective energy-momentum tensor stemming from the mass term is derived for the
spherically symmetric case. Only in the special case where the area of the two
sphere is not deviated away from the FLRW universe, the effective energy
momentum tensor becomes completely the same as that of cosmological constant.
This opens a window for discriminating the non-linear massive gravity from
general relativity (GR). Indeed, by further solving these spherically symmetric
gravitational equations of motion in vacuum to the linear order, we obtain a
solution which has an arbitrary time-dependent parameter. In GR, this parameter
is a constant and corresponds to the mass of a star. Our result means that
Birkhoff's theorem no longer holds in the non-linear massive gravity and
suggests that energy can probably be emitted superluminously (with infinite
speed) on the self-accelerating background by the helicity-0 mode, which could
be a potential plague of this theory.

and how it equilibrates is important for the extraction of the properties of

interesting characteristics of Quark-Gluon Plasma thermalization. For example,
screened parton interactions always lead to partial pressure isotropization.
Systems with different initial pressure anisotropies evolve toward the same
asymptotic evolution. In particular, radiative processes are crucial for the
chemical equilibration of the system. Matrix elements under the soft and
collinear approximation for these processes, as first derived by Gunion and
Bertsch, are widely used. A different approach is to start with the exact
matrix elements for the two to three and its inverse processes. General
features of this approach will be reviewed and the results will be compared

of fixed-to-variable length codes, such as the Shannon and Huffman codes,
exhibit two modes of behavior for long blocks. It either converges to a limit
or it has an oscillatory pattern, depending on the irrationality or
rationality, respectively, of certain parameters that depend on the source. In
this paper, we extend these findings, concerning the Shannon code, to the case
of a Markov source, which is considerably more involved. While this dichotomy,
of convergent vs. oscillatory behavior, is well known in other contexts
(including renewal theory, ergodic theory, local limit theorems and large
deviations of discrete distributions), in information theory (e.g., in
redundancy analysis) it was recognized relatively recently. To the best of our
knowledge, no results of this type were reported thus far for Markov sources.
We provide a precise characterization of the convergent vs. oscillatory
behavior of the Shannon code redundancy for a class of irreducible, periodic
and aperiodic, Markov sources. These findings are obtained by analytic methods,
such as Fourier/Fejer series analysis and spectral analysis of matrices.

proposed. The model is derived from an information conservation law stating
that the information is either in transit, lost or received. Mathematical
models of network elements such as queues, users, and transmission channels,
and network description variables, including sending/acknowledgement rates and
delays, are inferred from this law and obtained by applying this principle
locally. The modularity of the devised model makes it sufficiently generic to
describe any network topology, and appealing for building simulators. Previous
models in the literature are often not capable of capturing the transient
behavior of the network precisely, making the resulting analysis inaccurate in
practice. Those models can be recovered from exact reduction or approximation
of this new model. An important aspect of this particular modeling approach is
the introduction of new tight building blocks that implement mechanisms ignored
by the existing ones, notably at the queue and user levels. Comparisons with
packet-level simulations corroborate the proposed model.

this work, we aim at detecting events that can be characterized by changes to a
Hall of Fame ranking in an automated way. We describe how the schema and data
of a database can be used to generate Halls of Fame. In this database scenario,
by Hall of Fame we refer to distinguished tuples; entities, whose
characteristics set them apart from the majority. We define every Hall of Fame
as one specific instance of an SQL query, such that a change in its result is
considered a noteworthy event. Identified changes (i.e., events) are ranked
using lexicographic tradeoffs over event and query properties and presented to
users or fed in higher-level applications. We have implemented a full-fledged

formation of carbyne as the intermediate state. Such a pathway is seen to
exhibit two transitions states with reaction barriers of 0.21 eV/atom from ZzC

study the effects of strain, edge passivation, and surface functional species
on the structural and electronic properties of armchair graphene nanoribbons
(AGNRs) with a particular focus on the work function. The work function was
found to increase with uniaxial tensile strain while decreasing with
compression. The variation of the work function under strain is primarily due
to the shift of the Fermi energy with strain. In addition, the relationship
between the work function variation and the core level shift with strain is
discussed. Distinct trends of the core level shift under tensile and
compressive strain were discovered. For AGNRs with the edge carbon atoms
passivated by oxygen, the work function is higher than for nanoribbons with the
edge passivated by hydrogen under a moderate strain. The difference between the
work functions in these two edge passivations is enlarged (reduced) under a
sufficient tensile (compressive) strain. This has been correlated to a
direct-indirect band gap transition for tensile strains of about 4% and to a
structural transformation for large compressive strains at about -12%.
Furthermore, the effect of the surface species decoration, such as H, F, or OH
with different covering density, was investigated. It was found that the work
function varies with the type and coverage of surface functional species. F and
OH decoration increase the work function while H decreases it. The surface
functional species were decorated on either one side or both sides of AGNRs.
The difference in the work functions between one-side and two-side decorations
was found to be relatively small, which may suggest an introduced surface
dipole plays a minor role.

ask whether one can delete k vertices from the graph G to obtain a split graph
(i.e., a graph, whose vertex set can be partitioned into two sets: one inducing
a clique and the second one inducing an independent set). In this paper we
study fixed-parameter algorithms for Split Vertex Deletion parameterized by k:
we show that, up to a factor quasipolynomial in k and polynomial in n, the
Split Vertex Deletion problem can be solved in the same time as the
well-studied Vertex Cover problem. Plugging the currently best fixed-parameter
algorithm for Vertex Cover due to Chen et al. [TCS 2010], we obtain an
algorithm that solves Split Vertex Deletion in time O(1.2738^k * k^O(log k) +
n^O(1)).
  To achieve our goal, we prove the following structural result that may be of
independent interest: for any graph G we may compute a family P of size n^O(log
n) containing partitions of V(G) into two parts, such for any two disjoint
subsets X_C, X_I of V(G) where G[X_C] is a clique and G[X_I] is an independent

terms of fundamental fermion and gauge fields, the same type of degrees of
freedom as in the Standard Model. The theory is explicitly invariant under
local Lorentz transformations and, in the continuum limit, under
diffeomorphisms. It is suitable for describing large nonperturbative and
fast-varying fluctuations of metrics. Although the quantum curved space turns
out to be on the average flat and smooth owing to the non-compressibility of
the fundamental fermions, the low-energy Einstein limit is not automatic: one
needs to ensure that composite metrics fluctuations propagate to long distances
as compared to the lattice spacing. One way to guarantee this is to stay at a
phase transition.
  We develop a lattice mean field method and find that the theory typically has
several phases in the space of the dimensionless coupling constants, separated
by the second order phase transition surface. For example, there is a phase
with a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry. The effective low-energy
Lagrangian for the ensuing Goldstone field is explicitly
diffeomorphism-invariant. We expect that the Einstein gravitation is achieved
at the phase transition. A bonus is that the cosmological constant is probably
automatically zero.

magnetically dominated far from the source, and that in the magnetic limit,
physical self-similar solutions are admitted in which the total pressure within
the layer decreases linearly with distance from the contact discontinuity

by the relation A_{I} = 0.7465*E(V-I) + 1.3700*E(J-K_{s}), or, equivalently,
A_{I} = 1.217*E(V-I)(1+1.126*(E(J-K_{s})/E(V-I)-0.3433)). The optical and
near-IR reddening law toward the inner Galaxy approximately follows an R_{V}
\approx 2.5 extinction curve with a dispersion {\sigma}_{R_{V}} \approx 0.2,
consistent with extragalactic investigations of the hosts of type Ia SNe.
Differential reddening is shown to be significant on scales as small as as our
mean field size of 6', with the 1{\sigma} dispersion in reddening averaging 9%
of total reddening for our fields. The intrinsic luminosity parameters of the
Galactic bulge red clump (RC) are derived to be (M_{I,RC}, \sigma_{I,RC,0},
(V-I)_{RC,0}, \sigma_{(V-I)_{RC}}, (J-K_{s})_{RC,0}) = (-0.12, 0.09, 1.06,
0.121, 0.66). Our measurements of the RC brightness, brightness dispersion and
number counts allow us to estimate several Galactic bulge structural
parameters. We estimate a distance to the Galactic center of 8.20 kpc,
resolving previous discrepancies in distance determinations to the bulge based
on I-band observations. We measure an upper bound on the tilt {\alpha} \approx
40{\deg}. between the bar's major axis and the Sun-Galactic center line of
sight, though our brightness peaks are consistent with predictions of an N-body
model oriented at {\alpha} \approx 25{\deg}. The number of RC stars suggests a

(SNe) as Type-Ia or non-Ia. A two-step approach is adopted in which: (i) the SN
lightcurve flux measurements in each observing filter are fitted separately;
and (ii) the fitted function parameters and their associated uncertainties,
along with the number of flux measurements, the maximum-likelihood value of the
fit and Bayesian evidence for the model, are used as the input feature vector
to a classification neural network (NN) that outputs the probability that the
SN under consideration is of Type-Ia. The method is trained and tested using
data released following the SuperNova Photometric Classification Challenge
(SNPCC). We consider several random divisions of the data into training and
testing sets: for instance, for our sample D_1 (D_4), a total of 10% (40%) of
the data are involved in training the algorithm and the remainder used for
blind testing of the resulting classifier; we make no selection cuts. Assigning
a canonical threshold probability of p_th=0.5 on the NN output to classify a SN
as Type-Ia, for the sample D_1 (D_4) we obtain a completeness of 0.78 (0.82),
purity of 0.77 (0.82), and SNPCC figure-of-merit of 0.41 (0.50). Including the
SN host-galaxy redshift and its uncertainty as additional inputs to the NN
results in a modest 5-10% increase in these values. We find that the
classification quality does not vary significantly with SN redshift. Moreover,
our probabilistic classification method allows one to calculate the expected
completeness, purity or other measures of classification quality as a function
of the p_th, without knowing the true classes of the SNe in the testing sample.
The method may thus be improved further by optimising p_th and can easily be
extended to divide non-Ia SNe into their different classes.

morphology of disc galaxies that suffer from ram pressure. Several tree-SPH
(smoothed particle hydrodynamics) simulations have been carried out to study
the dependence of the star formation rate on the mass and size of a stellar
bulge. In addition, different strengths of ram pressure and different
alignments of the disc with respect to the intra-cluster medium (ICM) are
applied. As claimed in previous works, when ram pressure is acting on a galaxy,
the star formation rate (SFR) is enhanced and rises up to four times with
increasing ICM density compared to galaxies that evolve in isolation. However,
a bulge suppresses the SFR when the same ram pressure is applied. Consequently,
fewer new stars are formed because the SFR can be lowered by up to 2 M_sun/yr.
Furthermore, the denser the surrounding gas, the more inter-stellar medium
(ISM) is stripped. While at an ICM density of 10^-28 g/cm^3 about 30% of the
ISM is stripped, the galaxy is almost completely (more than 90%) stripped when
an ICM density of 10^-27 g/cm^3 is applied. But again, a bulge prevents the
stripping of the ISM and reduces the amount being stripped by up to 10%.
Thereby, fewer stars are formed in the wake if the galaxy contains a bulge. The
dependence of the SFR on the disc tilt angle is not very pronounced. Hereby a
slight trend of decreasing star formation with increasing inclination angle can
be determined. Furthermore, with increasing disc tilt angles, less gas is
stripped and therefore fewer stars are formed in the wake. Reducing the disc
gas mass fraction results in a lower SFR when the galaxies evolve in vacuum. On
the other hand, the enhancement of the SFR in case of acting ram pressure is
less pronounced with increasing gas mass fraction. Moreover, the fractional
amount of stripped gas does not depend on the gas mass fraction.

was discovered by the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) 15 days before maximum
light, allowing us to secure a time-series of four UV spectra at epochs from
-11 to +5 days relative to B-band maximum. The photospheric UV spectra are
excellent diagnostics of the iron-group abundances in the outer layers of the
ejecta, particularly those at very early times. Using the method of 'Abundance
Tomography' we have derived iron-group abundances in SN 2010jn with a precision
better than in any previously studied SN Ia. Optimum fits to the data can be
obtained if burned material is present even at high velocities, including
significant mass fractions of iron-group elements. This is consistent with the
slow decline rate (or high 'stretch') of the light curve of SN 2010jn, and
consistent with the results of delayed-detonation models. Early-phase UV
spectra and detailed time-dependent series of further SNe Ia offer a promising
probe of the nature of the SN Ia mechanism.

examining subsets of the data with two other methods that have often been used

comparisons between synthetic spectra and actual spectra, show strong
correlations between temperature, [Fe/H], and log g when solving for all three

traditional curve-of-growth approach, show no such correlations. To combat the
correlations and improve the accuracy of the temperatures and metallicities, we
repeat the SPC analysis with a constraint on log g based on the mean stellar
density that can be derived from the analysis of the transit light curves.
Previous studies that have not taken advantage of this constraint have been
subject to systematic errors in the stellar masses and radii of up to 20% and

undirected n-vertex graph G, a collection M={(s_1,t_1),...,(s_k,t_k)} of demand
pairs and an integer c. The goal is to connect the maximum possible number of
the demand pairs by paths, so that the maximum edge congestion - the number of
paths sharing any edge - is bounded by c. When the maximum allowed congestion
is c=1, this is the classical Edge-Disjoint Paths problem (EDP).
  The best current approximation algorithm for EDP achieves an $O(\sqrt
n)$-approximation, by rounding the standard multi-commodity flow relaxation of
the problem. This matches the $\Omega(\sqrt n)$ lower bound on the integrality
gap of this relaxation. We show an $O(poly log k)$-approximation algorithm for
EDPwC with congestion c=2, by rounding the same multi-commodity flow
relaxation. This gives the best possible congestion for a sub-polynomial
approximation of EDPwC via this relaxation. Our results are also close to
optimal in terms of the number of pairs routed, since EDPwC is known to be hard
to approximate to within a factor of $\tilde{\Omega}((\log n)^{1/(c+1)})$ for
any constant congestion c. Prior to our work, the best approximation factor for
EDPwC with congestion 2 was $\tilde O(n^{3/7})$, and the best algorithm
achieving a polylogarithmic approximation required congestion 14.

are in binary systems with low-mass companions, which are most likely white
dwarfs, and which have orbital periods on the order of days. The fourth pulsar
is isolated. All four pulsars have large dispersion measures (DM > 100 pc
cm-3), are distant (> 3.4 kpc), faint at 1.4 GHz (< 0.2 mJy), and are fully
recycled (with spin periods P between 3.5 and 4.9 ms). The three binaries also
have very small orbital eccentricities, as expected for tidally circularized,
fully recycled systems with low-mass companions. These four pulsars have DM/P
ratios that are among the highest values for field MSPs in the Galaxy. These
discoveries bring the total number of confirmed MSPs from the PALFA survey to
fifteen. The discovery of these MSPs illustrates the power of PALFA for finding
weak, distant MSPs at low-Galactic latitudes. This is important for accurate
estimates of the Galactic MSP population and for the number of MSPs that the

By comparing quantum wells of the same dimension but with two different

boundary condition of correlated electrons is critical to selecting the
many-body ground state. In particular, the long-range orderings and the MIT are
found to be strongly enhanced under quantum confinement by sandwiching
NdNiO$_{3}$ with the wide-gap dielectric LaAlO$_{3}$, while they are suppressed
when one of the interfaces is replaced by a surface (interface with vacuum).
Resonant spectroscopy reveals that the reduced charge fluctuations in the

and business policy and decision making. It will be showed and motivated that
social systems are typically chaotic, non-linear and/or non-equilibrium and
therefore complex systems. It is discussed that the rapid change in global
consumer behaviour is underway, that further increases the complexity in
business and management. For policy making under complexity, following
principles are offered: openness and international competition, tolerance and
variety of ideas, self-reliability and low dependence on external help. The
chapter contains four applications that build on the theoretical motivation of
complexity in social systems. The first application demonstrates that small
economies have good prospects to gain from the global processes underway, if
they can demonstrate production flexibility, reliable business ethics and good
risk management. The second application elaborates on and discusses the
opportunities and challenges in decision making under complexity from macro and
micro economic perspective. In this environment, the challenges for corporate
management are being also permanently changed: the balance between short term
noise and long term chaos whose attractor includes customers, shareholders and
employees must be found. The emergence of chaos in economic relationships is
demonstrated by a simple system of differential equations that relate the
stakeholders described above. The chapter concludes with two financial
applications: about debt and risk management. The non-equilibrium economic
establishment leads to additional problems by using excessive borrowing;
unexpected downturns in economy can more easily kill companies. Finally, the
demand for quantitative improvements in risk management is postulated.

hadronization model matched to available data at LHC energies. The dynamical
simulations within the PHSD show a moderate increase of the low mass dilepton
yield essentially due to the in-medium modification of the rho-meson.
Furthermore, pronounced traces of the partonic degrees of freedom are found in
the PHSD results in the intermediate mass regime. The dilepton production from
the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) exceeds that from the
semi-leptonic decays of open charm and bottom mesons. Additionally, we observe
that a transverse momentum cut of 1 GeV/c further suppresses the relative
contribution of the heavy meson decays to the dilepton yield, such that the
sQGP radiation strongly dominates the spectrum for masses from 1 to 3 GeV,

(with projected velocities out to 2.1 km/s, corresponding to intrinsic orbital
velocities >20 km/s) that trace molecular gas as close as 2 AU from the central
star. However, we are not able to reproduce the intensity of these wings and
the general spatio-kinematic pattern of the lines with simple models for the
disk structure and kinematics. Using three-dimensional non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium molecular excitation and radiative transfer calculations, we
construct some alternative models that successfully account for these features
by modifying either (1) the temperature structure of the inner disk (inside the
dust-depleted disk cavity; r < 4 AU); (2) the intrinsic (Keplerian) disk
velocity field; or (3) the distribution of disk inclination angles (a warp).
The latter approach is particularly compelling because a representative warped
disk model qualitatively reproduces the observed azimuthal modulation of
optical light scattered off the disk surface. In any model scenario, the ALMA
data clearly require a substantial molecular gas reservoir located inside the
region where dust optical depths are known to be substantially diminished in
the TW Hya disk, in agreement with previous studies based on infrared
spectroscopy. The results from these updated model prescriptions are discussed
in terms of their potential physical origins, which might include dynamical
perturbations from a low-mass companion with an orbital separation of a few AU.

due to the apparent smallness of new physics effects, together with the
outstanding precision expected from present and future collider experiments. A
very recent analysis is presented, which yields a stronger bound for the
maximal influence of penguin contributions than previous analyses and shows the

  Direct CP violation in hadronic charm decays received a lot of attention

large result. While this value is certainly not generically predicted in the

occur: either the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ changes abruptly at
$\bar U$, as the system undergoes a transition from one topologically
non-trivial insulator to another, or the transition is through an anomalous
Hall metal, and $\sigma_{xy}$ changes smoothly between two different quantized

spinless models, the half-filled system becomes a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological

$\bar U$ and the quantized spin Hall response changes abruptly.

the convection zone to near the solar surface by embedding a thin flux tube
model in a rotating spherical shell of solar-like turbulent convection. These
toroidal flux tubes that we simulate range in magnetic field strength from 15
kG to 100 kG at initial latitudes of 1 degree to 40 degrees in both
hemispheres. This article expands upon Weber, Fan, and Miesch (Astrophys. J.,
741, 11, 2011) (Article 1) with the inclusion of tubes with magnetic flux of
10^20 Mx and 10^21 Mx, and more simulations of the previously investigated case
of 10^22 Mx, sampling more convective flows than the previous article, greatly
improving statistics. Observed properties of active regions are compared to
properties of the simulated emerging flux tubes, including: the tilt of active
regions in accordance with Joy's Law as in Article 1, and in addition the
scatter of tilt angles about the Joy's Law trend, the most commonly occurring
tilt angle, the rotation rate of the emerging loops with respect to the
surrounding plasma, and the nature of the magnetic field at the flux tube apex.
We discuss how these diagnostic properties constrain the initial field strength
of the active region flux tubes at the bottom of the solar convection zone, and
suggest that flux tubes of initial magnetic field strengths of \geq 40 kG are
good candidates for the progenitors of large (10^21 Mx to 10^22 Mx) solar
active regions, which agrees with the results from Article 1 for flux tubes of
10^22 Mx. With the addition of more magnetic flux values and more simulations,
we find that for all magnetic field strengths, the emerging tubes show a
positive Joy's Law trend, and that this trend does not show a statistically
significant dependence on the magnetic flux.

size of competing native species and consequently also in their genetic
diversity. We are interested in why these adverse effects are weak in some
cases whereas in others the native species declines to the point of extinction.
While the introduction rate and the growth rate of the introduced species in
the new environment clearly have a positive relationship with invasion success
and impact, the influence of competition is poorly understood. Here, we
investigate how the intensity of interspecific competition influences the
persistence time of a native species in the face of repeated and ongoing
introductions of the nonnative species. We analyze two stochastic models: a
model for the population dynamics of both species and a model that additionally
includes the population genetics of the native species at a locus involved in
its adaptation to a changing environment. Counterintuitively, both models
predict that the persistence time of the native species is lowest for an
intermediate intensity of competition. This phenomenon results from the
opposing effects of competition at different stages of the invasion process:
With increasing competition intensity more introduction events are needed until
a new species can establish, but increasing competition also speeds up the
exclusion of the native species by an established nonnative competitor. By
comparing the ecological and the eco-genetic model, we detect and quantify a
synergistic feedback between ecological and genetic effects.

control on the behaviour of grounded tidewater glaciers, modelling studies have
focused largely on the effects of basal and surface melting. Here, a
finite-element model of stresses near the front of a tidewater glacier is used
to investigate the effects of frontal melting on calving, independently of the
calving criterion used. Applications of the stress model to idealized scenarios
reveal that undercutting of the ice front due to frontal melting can drive
calving at up to ten times the mean melt rate. Factors which cause increased
frontal melt-driven calving include a strong thermal gradient in the ice, and a
concentration of frontal melt at the base of the glacier. These properties are
typical of both Arctic and Antarctic tidewater glaciers. The finding that
frontal melt near the base is a strong driver of calving leads to the
conclusion that water temperatures near the bed of the glacier are critically
important to the glacier front, and thus the flow of the glacier. These
conclusions are robust against changes in the basal boundary condition and the
choice of calving criterion, as well as variations in the glacier size or level
of crevassing.

clarify several issues regarding this fundamental plane, including
demonstrating that the fundamental plane is not uniquely defined. We also show
that, if magnetars and all other pulsars are different manifestations of a
unified picture of neutron stars, then pulsar radio activity (inactivity)
appears to be determined by the ratio Lx/Edot<1 (Lx/Edot>1), although
observational bias and uncertainty in the ratio for some sources may still
invalidate this conclusion. Finally, we comment on the use of other pulsar

to a conventional BEC of diatomic molecules. This behavior is associated with
the non-monotonic dependence of the chemical potential on detuning and the
concomitant Cooper-pair/molecular size, larger in the BCS and smaller in the
BEC regimes. For a single filled band we find a quantum phase transition from a
band insulator to a BCS-BEC superfluid, and map out the corresponding phase
diagram.

Spectrograph and Imager, to isolate the narrow-line regions (NLRs) of these
low-mass BHs. We investigate their emission-line properties and compare them
with those of AGN with higher-mass black holes. While we are unable to
determine absolute metallicities, some of our objects plausibly represent
examples of the low-metallicity AGN described by Groves et al. (2006), based on
their [N II]/H_alpha ratios and their consistency with the Kewley & Ellison
(2008) mass-metallicity relation. We find tentative evidence for steeper far-UV
spectral slopes in lower-mass systems. Overall, NLR emission lines in these
low-mass AGN exhibit trends similar to those seen in AGN with higher-mass BHs,
such as increasing blueshifts and broadening with increasing ionization
potential. Additionally, we see evidence of an intermediate line region whose
intensity correlates with L/L_Edd, as seen in higher-mass AGN. We highlight the
interesting trend that, at least in these low-mass AGN, the [O III] equivalent
width (EW) is highest in symmetric NLR lines with no blue wing. This trend of
increasing [O III] EW with line symmetry could be explained by a high covering
factor of lower ionization gas in the NLR. In general, low-mass AGN preserve
many well-known trends in the structure of the NLR, while exhibiting steeper
ionizing continuum slopes and somewhat lower gas-phase metallicities.

Halo and the thick disc. The spectra display typical features of carbon stars
with SiC dust emission and C$_2$H$_2$ molecular absorption. Dust radiative
transfer models and infrared colors enable us to determine the dust production
rates for these stars whilst prior CO measurements yield expansion velocities
and total mass-loss rates.
  The gas properties (low expansion velocities (around 7 km/s) and strong
C$_2$H$_2$ molecular absorption bands) are consistent with the stars being
metal-poor. However the dust content of these stars (strong SiC emission bands)
is very similar to what is observed in metal-rich carbon stars. The strong SiC
emission may indicate that the carbon stars derive from a metal-rich
population, or that these AGB stars produce silicon.
  The origin of the halo carbon stars is not known. They may be extrinsinc halo
stars belonging to the halo population, they may have been accreted from a
satellite galaxy such as the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy, or they may
be escapees from the galactic disk. If the stars are intrinsically metal-rich,
an origin in the disc would be most likely. If an $\alpha$-element enhancement
can be confirmed, it would argue for an origin in the halo (which is known to
be $\alpha$-enhanced) or a Galactic satellite.

accounts for the features of the interband tunneling generation of electrons
and holes and their ballistic transport in the device i-section, as well as the
effect of the self-consistent electric field associated with the charges of
propagating electrons and holes. Using the developed model, we calculate the dc
current-voltage characteristics and the small-signal ac frequency-dependent
admittance as functions of the GTUNNETT structural parameters, in particular,
the number of graphene layers and the dielectric constant of the surrounding
media. It is shown that the admittance real part can be negative in a certain
frequency range. As revealed, if the i-section somewhat shorter than one
micrometer, this range corresponds to the terahertz frequencies. Due to the
effect of the self-consistent electric field, the behavior of the GTUNNETT
admittance in the range of its negativity of its real part is rather sensitive
to the relation between the number of graphene layers and dielectric constant.
The obtained results demonstrate that GTUNNETTs with optimized structure can be
used in efficient terahertz oscillators.

enhances the magnetization density and spin susceptibility at the surface,
compared with that in the normal 3He. To capture the characteristics of the

susceptibility which is detectable through NMR experiments. It turns out that
the contribution of the SABS leads to nonmonotonic temperature-dependence of

result of adverse environmental or external conditions. Modeling deterioration
is essential to define optimum design strategies and inspection and maintenance
(intervention) programs. In particular, the main purpose of maintenance is to
increase the system availability by extending the life of the system. Most
strategies for maintenance optimization focus on defining long term strategies
based on the system's condition at the decision time (e.g., $t=0$). However,
due to the large uncertainty in the system's performance through life, an
optimal maintenance policy requires both permanent monitoring and a
cost-efficient plan of interventions. This paper presents a model to define an
optimal maintenance policy of systems that deteriorate as a result of shocks.
Deterioration caused by shocks is modeled as a compound Poisson process and the
optimal maintenance strategy is based on an impulse control model. In the model
the optimal time and size of interventions are executed according the the
system state, which is obtained from permanent monitoring.

closely related game in which the players choose positive real numbers between
1 and 10, multiply them together, and move the decimal point, if necessary, so
that the result is between 1 and 10. The mixed strategies are probability
distributions on this interval, and it is shown that for both players it is
optimal to choose their numbers from the Benford distribution. Furthermore,
this strategy is optimal for any winning set, and the probability of winning is
the Benford measure of the player's winning set. Using these results we prove
that the original game in which the players choose integers has a well-defined

lattice brings much novel features in strongly correlated models. Here we study
the ground-state phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model on the honeycomb
lattice at half-filling by using an extended mean-field theory. By treating
magnetic interaction and Kondo screening on an equal footing, it is found that
besides a trivial discontinuous first-order quantum phase transition between
well-defined Kondo insulator and antiferromagnetic insulating state, there can
exist a wide coexistence region with both Kondo screening and antiferromagnetic
orders in the intermediate coupling regime. In addition, the stability of Kondo
insulator requires a minimum strength of the Kondo coupling. These features are
attributed to the linear density of state, which are absent in the square
lattice. Furthermore, fluctuation effect beyond the mean-field decoupling is
analyzed and the corresponding antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave transition
falls into the O(3) universal class. Comparatively, we also discuss the Kondo
necklace and the Kane-Mele-Kondo (KMK) lattice models on the same lattice.
Interestingly, it is found that the topological insulating state is unstable to
the usual antiferromagnetic ordered states at half-filling for the KMK model.
The present work may be helpful for further studies on the interplay between
conduction electrons and the densely localized spins on the honeycomb lattice.

Lorentz invariant, but it appears that this invariance should be broken by the
nucleation process. Here, we use a model detector, consisting of other
particles interacting with the pairs, to investigate how pair production is
seen by different Lorentzian observers. We focus on the idealized situation
where a constant external electric field is present for an infinitely long
time, and we consider the in-vacuum state for a charged scalar field that
describes the nucleating pairs. The in-vacuum is defined in terms of modes
which are positive frequency in the remote past. Even though the construction
uses a particular reference frame and a gauge where the vector potential is
time dependent, we show explicitly that the resulting quantum state is Lorentz
invariant. We then introduce a ""detector"" particle which interacts with the
nucleated pairs, and show that all Lorentzian observers will see the particles
and antiparticles nucleating preferentially at rest in the detector's rest
frame. Similar conclusions are expected to apply to bubble nucleation in a
sufficiently long lived vacuum. We also comment on certain unphysical aspects
of the Lorentz invariant in-vacuum, associated with the fact that it contains
an infinite density of particles. This can be easily remedied by considering
Lorentz breaking initial conditions.

move to IP represents progress, new and different Internet architectures might
be better-suited for instrumented environments. In this paper, we consider
security of instrumented environments in the context of Content-Centric

Named-Data Networking (NDN), a prominent instance of CCN. After identifying
security requirements in a specific BAS sub-domain (lighting control), we

and report on preliminary implementation and experimental results. We believe
in securing a communication paradigm well outside of its claimed forte of

the cosmological perturbations of the universe by acting as an isocurvature
mode during a de Sitter inflationary stage. In view of the recent ATLAS and CMS
results for the Higgs mass, this can happen if the Hubble rate during inflation
is in the range $(10^{10}- 10^{14})$ GeV (depending on the SM parameters).
Implications for the detection of primordial tensor perturbations through the
$B$-mode of CMB polarization via the PLANCK satellite are discussed. For
example, if the Higgs mass value is confirmed to be $m_h=125.5$ GeV and $m_t,
\alpha_s$ are at their central values, our mechanism predicts tensor
perturbations too small to be detected in the near future. On the other hand,
if tensor perturbations will be detected by PLANCK through the $B$-mode of CMB,
then there is a definite relation between the Higgs and top masses, making the
mechanism predictive and falsifiable.

a Be star. The system is particularly interesting because it is the only
gamma-ray binary system where the nature of the compact object is known. The
non-thermal radiation from the system is powered by the spin-down luminosity of
the pulsar and the unpulsed radiation originates from the stand-off shock front
which forms between the pulsar and stellar wind. The Be star/optical companion
in the system produces an excess infrared flux from the associated
circumstellar disc. This infrared excess provides an additional photon source
for inverse Compton scattering. We discuss the effects of the IR excess near
periastron, for anisotropic inverse Compton scattering and associated gamma-ray
production. We determine the infrared excess from the circumstellar disc using
a modified version of a curve of growth method, which takes into account the
changing optical depth through the circumstellar disc during the orbit. The
model is constrained using archive data and additional mid-IR observations
obtained with the VLT during January 2011. The inverse Compton scattering rate
was calculated for three orientations of the circumstellar disc. The predicted
gamma-ray light curves show that the disc contribution is a maximum around
periastron and not around the disc crossing epoch. This is a result of the disc
being brightest near the stellar surface. Additional spectroscopic and
near-infrared observations were obtained of the system and these are discussed
in relation to the possibility of shock heating during the disc crossing epoch.

simulations show that the interactions of azimuthally drifting flow
perturbations with the fundamental drift of the magnetic eigenmode (caused by
the inevitable equatorial symmetry breaking of the basic flow) essentially
determine the temporal behavior of the dynamo state. We find two distinct
regimes of dynamo action that depend on the (prescribed) drift frequency of an

vortices we observe a narrow window with enhanced growth-rates and a drift of
the magnetic eigenmode that is synchronized with the perturbation drift. The
resonance-like enhancement of the growth-rates takes place when the vortex
drift frequency roughly equals the drift frequency of the magnetic eigenmode in
the unperturbed system. Outside of this small window, the field generation is
hampered compared to the unperturbed case, and the field amplitude of the
magnetic eigenmode is modulated with approximately twice the vortex drift
frequency. The abrupt transition between the resonant regime and the modulated
regime is identified as an spectral exceptional point where eigenvalues
(growth-rates and frequencies) and eigenfunctions of two previously independent
modes collapse.

signals with real-valued samples, based on the analytic signal which is a
complex signal with one-sided Fourier transform. We extend these ideas to
signals with complex-valued samples, using a quaternion-valued equivalent of
the analytic signal obtained from a one-sided quaternion Fourier transform
which we refer to as the hypercomplex representation of the complex signal. We
present the necessary properties of the quaternion Fourier transform,
particularly its symmetries in the frequency domain and formulae for
convolution and the quaternion Fourier transform of the Hilbert transform. The
hypercomplex representation may be interpreted as an ordered pair of complex
signals or as a quaternion signal. We discuss its derivation and properties and
show that its quaternion Fourier transform is one-sided. It is shown how to
derive from the hypercomplex representation a complex envelope and a phase.
  A classical result in the case of real signals is that an amplitude modulated
signal may be analysed into its envelope and carrier using the analytic signal
provided that the modulating signal has frequency content not overlapping with
that of the carrier. We show that this idea extends to the complex case,
provided that the complex signal modulates an orthonormal complex exponential.
Orthonormal complex modulation can be represented mathematically by a polar
representation of quaternions previously derived by the authors. As in the
classical case, there is a restriction of non-overlapping frequency content
between the modulating complex signal and the orthonormal complex exponential.
We show that, under these conditions, modulation in the time domain is
equivalent to a frequency shift in the quaternion Fourier domain. Examples are
presented to demonstrate these concepts.

simulations in the hydrodynamics limit, in laminar and also turbulent regimes.
In the latter case, the underlying Boltzmann equation describes a distribution
of eddies, in line with the concept of eddy viscosity developed by Lord Kelvin
and Osborne Reynolds at the end of the nineteenth century. These schemes are
physically more consistent than schemes derived from the Navier-Stokes
equations, which invariably assume infinite collisions between gas particles
(or interactions between eddies) in the calculation of advective fluxes. In
fact, in continuum regime too, the local Knudsen number can exceed the value
0.001 in shock layers, where gas-kinetic schemes outperform Navier-Stokes
schemes, as is well known.
  Simulation of turbulent flows benefit from the application of gas-kinetic
schemes, as the turbulent Knudsen number (the ratio between the eddies' mean
free path and the mean flow scale) can locally reach values well in excess of
0.001, not only in shock layers.
  This study has investigated a few cases of shock - boundary layer interaction
comparing a gas-kinetic scheme and a Navier-Stokes one, both with a standard
k-\omega turbulence model. Whereas the results obtained from the Navier-Stokes
scheme are affected by the limitations of eddy viscosity two-equation models,
the gas-kinetic scheme has performed much better without making any further
assumption on the turbulent structures.

dimensions perpendicular to the background magnetic field, two independent
cascades may take place simultaneously because of the presence of two
collisionless invariants. In the present work, freely decaying turbulence of
two-dimensional electrostatic gyrokinetics is investigated by means of
phenomenological theory and direct numerical simulations. A dual cascade
(forward and inverse cascades) is observed in velocity space as well as in
position space, which we diagnose by means of nonlinear transfer functions for
the collisionless invariants. We find that the turbulence tends to a
time-asymptotic state, dominated by a single scale that grows in time. A theory
of this asymptotic state is derived in the form of decay laws. Each case that
we study falls into one of three regimes (weakly collisional, marginal, and
strongly collisional), determined by a dimensionless number D*, a quantity
analogous to the Reynolds number. The marginal state is marked by a critical
number D* = D0 that is preserved in time. Turbulence initialized above this
value become increasingly inertial in time, evolving toward larger and larger
D*; turbulence initialized below D0 become more and more collisional, decaying
to progressively smaller D*.

extent into the ambient medium. The main pressure support of these bubbles is
not known to date, but cosmic rays are a viable possibility. For such a
scenario copious gamma-ray emission is expected as a tracer of cosmic rays from
these systems. Hydra A, the closest galaxy cluster hosting a cluster scale AGN
outburst, located at a redshift of 0.0538, is investigated for being a
gamma-ray emitter with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) array and
the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Data obtained in 20.2 hours of
dedicated H.E.S.S. observations and 38 months of Fermi-LAT data, gathered by
its usual all-sky scanning mode, have been analyzed to search for a gamma-ray
signal. No signal has been found in either data set. Upper limits on the
gamma-ray flux are derived and are compared to models. These are the first
limits on gamma-ray emission ever presented for galaxy clusters hosting cluster
scale AGN outbursts. The non-detection of Hydra A in gamma-rays has important
implications on the particle populations and physical conditions inside the
bubbles in this system. For the case of bubbles mainly supported by hadronic
cosmic rays, the most favorable scenario, that involves full mixing between
cosmic rays and embedding medium, can be excluded. However, hadronic cosmic
rays still remain a viable pressure support agent to sustain the bubbles
against the thermal pressure of the ambient medium. The largest population of
highly-energetic electrons which are relevant for inverse-Compton gamma-ray
production is found in the youngest inner lobes of Hydra A. The limit on the
inverse-Compton gamma-ray flux excludes a magnetic field below half of the
equipartition value of 16 muG in the inner lobes.

Shorter periods show oscillations in all the three line parameters and the
longer ones only in intensity and Doppler shift but not in line width. Line
profiles at both these locations do not show any visible blue-shifted component
and can be fitted well with a single Gaussian function along with a polynomial
background. Results using co-spatial and co-temporal data from AIA/SDO do not
show any significant peak corresponding to shorter periods, but longer periods
are clearly observed in both 171 \AA and 193 \AA channels. Space-time analysis
in these fan loops using images from AIA/SDO show alternate slanted ridges of
positive slope, indicative of outward propagating disturbances. The apparent
propagation speeds were estimated to be 83.5 $\pm$ 1.8 \kms and 100.5 $\pm$ 4.2
\kms, respectively, in the 171 \AA and 193 \AA channels. Observed short period
oscillations are suggested to be caused by the simultaneous presence of more

magneto-acoustic waves. In case of shorter periods, the amplitude of
oscillation is found to be higher in EIS lines with relatively higher
temperature of formation. Longer periods, when observed from AIA, show a
decrease of amplitude in hotter AIA channels which might indicate damping due

corresponding to cluster spiral galaxies, is also possible, but such galaxies
are expected to be rare. All these relations have the form M_{\rm BH} =

density functional theory as implemented in the full-potential linearized
augmented plane-wave (FLAPW) method and mapped to a tight-binding like

We vary the Mn-Mn separation from the contact (about 2.5 to 5 {\AA}) to the far
tunneling regime (5 to 10 {\AA}). The magnetization direction of the Co
electrodes is chosen either in parallel or antiparallel alignment and we allow
for different spin configurations of the two Mn spins. In the tunneling and

contribution for a parallel magnetization alignment from the $d_{xz}$- and
$d_{yz}$-states which give rise to an increase of the magnetoresistance as it
is absent for antiparallel magnetization. If we allow the Mn spins to relax a
non-collinear spin state is formed close to contact. We demonstrate that the
transition from a collinear to such a non-collinear spin structure as the two
Mn atoms approach leaves a characteristic fingerprint in the distance-dependent
conductance and magnetoresistance of the junction. We explain the effect of the
non-collinear spin state on the conductance based on the spin-dependent
hybridization between the $d_{xz,yz}$-states of the Mn spins and their coupling
to the Co electrodes.

follows a local clock initiated at t=0. The random time \tau between clock
ticks follows the waiting time density \psi(\tau). Transitions between states
occur only at local clock ticks and are hence triggered by the local forward
waiting time, rather than by \psi(\tau). For power-law forms \psi(\tau) ~
\tau^{-1-\alpha} (0<\alpha<1) we obtain a logarithmic time evolution of the

for the X-ray production in this class of sources. The broad-band average
spectrum is well-described by thermal Comptonization with an electron
temperature of kT_e ~ 50 keV, soft seed photons of kT_bb ~ 1 keV, and Thomson
optical depth \taut ~ 1 in a slab geometry. The slab area corresponds to a
black body radius of R_bb ~9 km. During the outburst, the spectrum stays
remarkably stable with plasma and soft seed photon temperatures and scattering
optical depth that are constant within the errors. This behavior has been
interpreted as indicating that the X-ray emission originates above the neutron
star (NS) surface in a hot slab (either the heated NS surface or the accretion
shock). The INTEGRAL, RXTE, and Swift data reveal the X-ray pulsation at a
period of 2.5 milliseconds up to ~65 keV. The pulsed fraction is consistent
with being constant, i.e. energy independent and has a typical value of 6-7%.
The nearly sinusoidal pulses show soft lags that seem to saturate near 10 keV
at a rather small value of ~ -60\mu s with those observed in other accreting
pulsars. The short burst profiles indicate that there is a hydrogen-poor
material at ignition, which suggests either that the accreted material is
hydrogen-deficient, or that the CNO metallicity is up to a factor of about two
times solar. However, the variation in the burst recurrence time as a function
of \dot{m} (inferred from the X-ray flux) is much smaller than predicted by
helium-ignition models.

The thermalization process is studied by numerically solving Einstein's
equations coupled to a massless scalar field in the Poincare patch of AdS_5. We
define a thermalization time t_T on the AdS side, which has an interpretation
in terms of a spacelike Wilson loop <W(l =1/T)> in CFT. Here T is the thermal
equilibrium temperature. We study both cases with the source turned on in
short(Delta t <= 1/T) and long(Delta t >= 1/T) durations. In the former case,
the thermalization time t_T = g_t/T <= 1/T and the coefficient g_t = 0.73 in

multiple-collapse solutions, which may be interpreted as the gravity duals of

exploration of Standard Model physics, such as precise measurements of the

a \sim125 GeV Higgs-like particle at the LHC, and pending further LHC results
at 8 TeV and 14 TeV, a linear e+e- collider built and operated in
centre-of-mass energy stages from a few-hundred GeV up to a few TeV will be an
ideal physics exploration tool, complementing the LHC. Two example scenarios
are presented for a CLIC accelerator built in three main stages of 500 GeV, 1.4

experiments and accompanied by cost estimates. The resulting CLIC physics
potential and measurement precisions are illustrated through detector

with NGC 4756 indeed sits on top of extended emission from the background
cluster A1361, but can be relatively well distinguished from it as a
significant excess over it out to r\sim150""\ (~40 kpc). NGC 4756 has an X-ray
luminosity of ~10^41 erg/s due to hot gas, with an average temperature of
kT\sim0.7 keV. We measure a faint diffuse emission also in the region of the

perturbative, and, up to second order in a small parameter, it expands at a
rate exactly equal to the one expected in a dust dominated
Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) model with the equivalent,
smoothed, energy density. Therefore, the kinematics of both cosmologies are
identical up to the order of perturbation studied. Looking at the behaviour of
the redshift and angular distance, we find a condition on the compactness of
the objects at the centre of each cell under which corrections to the FLRW
observables remain small, i.e. of order of a few percents at most.
Nevertheless, we show that, if this condition is violated, i.e. if the objects
are too compact, our perturbative scheme breaks down as far as the calculations
of observables are concerned, even though the kinematics of the lattice remains
identical to its FLRW counter-part (at the perturbative order considered). This
may be an indication of an actual fitting problem, i.e. a situation in which
the FLRW model obtained from lightcone observables does not correspond to the
FLRW model obtained by smoothing the spatial distribution of matter. Fully
non-perturbative treatments of the observables will be necessary to answer that

Laryngectomy, which is the surgical removal of all or part of the larynx or the
voice box, particularly performed in cases of laryngeal cancer. A primitive
method of achieving voice morphing is by extracting the source's vocal
coefficients and then converting them into the target speaker's vocal
parameters. In this paper, we deploy Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) for mapping
the coefficients from source to destination. However, the use of the
traditional/conventional GMM-based mapping approach results in the problem of
over-smoothening of the converted voice. Thus, we hereby propose a unique
method to perform efficient voice morphing and conversion based on GMM,which
overcomes the traditional-method effects of over-smoothening. It uses a
technique of glottal waveform separation and prediction of excitations and
hence the result shows that not only over-smoothening is eliminated but also
the transformed vocal tract parameters match with the target. Moreover, the
synthesized speech thus obtained is found to be of a sufficiently high quality.
Thus, voice morphing based on a unique GMM approach has been proposed and also
critically evaluated based on various subjective and objective evaluation
parameters. Further, an application of voice morphing for Laryngectomees which
deploys this unique approach has been recommended by this paper.

activity in 2008, the source's flux has been declining, as it approaches its
quiescent state. For an assumed power-law spectrum, we find that the absorbed
2--10 keV flux for the source is $1.0^{+0.3}_{-0.2} \times 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2}
s^{-1}$ with a photon index of $2.9 \pm 0.8$ ($N_H=1.0\times10^{23}$ cm^{-2}).
This flux is approximately consistent with that measured at the same time after
the source's outburst in 1998. With measurements spanning 3 years after the
2008 outburst, we analyze the long-term flux and spectral evolution of the
source. The flux evolution is well described by a double exponential with decay
times of 0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 and 59 $\pm$ 6 days, and a thermal cooling model fit
suggests that SGR 1627-41 may have a hot core ($T_c ~ 2\times 10^8$ K). We find
no clear correlation between flux and spectral hardness as found in other
magnetars. We consider the quiescent X-ray luminosities of magnetars and the

Momentum loss from the jet system may excite the planets' orbital eccentricity
and inclination (Namouni 2005, AJ 130, 280). Evaluating quantitatively the
effects of such excitation requires a realistic modeling of the momentum loss
profiles associated with stellar jets. In this work, we model linear momentum
loss as a time-variable stochastic process that results in a zero mean stellar
acceleration. Momentum loss may involve periodic or random polarity reversals.
We characterize orbital excitation as a function of the variability timescale
and identify a novel excitation resonance between a planet's orbital period and
the jet's variability timescale where the former equals twice the latter. For
constant variability timescales, resonance is efficient for both periodic and
random polarity reversals, the latter being stronger than the former. For a
time variable variability timescale, resonance crossing is a more efficient
excitation mechanism when polarity reversals are periodic. Each polarity
reversal type has distinct features that may help constrain the magnetic
history of the star through the observation of its planetary companions. For
instance, outward planet migration to large distances from parent stars is one
of the natural outcomes of periodic polarity reversal excitation if resonance
crossing is sufficiently slow. Applying the excitation mechanism to the solar
system, we find that the planet-jet variability resonance with periodic
polarity reversal momentum loss is a possible origin for the hitherto
unexplained inclination of Jupiter's orbit by 6 deg. with respect to the Sun's
equator.

In a multiple tiling, a convex body $P$ is translated with a discrete multiset
$\Lambda$ in such a way that each point of the space gets covered exactly $k$
times, except perhaps the translated copies of the boundary of $P$. It is known
that all possible multiple tilers in 3D are zonotopes. In 2D it was known by
the work of M. Kolountzakis that, unless $P$ is a parallelogram, the multiset
of translation vectors $\Lambda$ must be a finite union of translated lattices
(also known as quasi periodic sets). In that work [Kolountzakis, 2002], the
author asked whether the same quasi-periodic structure on the translation
vectors would be true in 3D. Here we prove that this conclusion is indeed true
for 3D.
  Namely, we show that if $P$ is a convex multiple tiler in 3D, with a discrete
multiset $\Lambda$ of translation vectors, then $\Lambda$ has to be a finite
union of translated lattices, unless $P$ belongs to a special class of
zonotopes. This exceptional class consists of two-flat zonotopes $P$, defined
by the Minkowski sum of $n+m$ line segments that lie in the union of two
different two-dimensional subspaces $H_1$ and $H_2$. Equivalently, a two-flat
zonotope $P$ may be thought of as the Minkowski sum of two 2-dimensional
symmetric polygons one of which may degenerate into a single line segment. It
turns out that rational two-flat zonotopes admit a multiple tiling with an
aperiodic (non-quasi-periodic) set of translation vectors $\Lambda$. We note
that it may be quite difficult to offer a visualization of these 3-dimensional
non-quasi-periodic tilings, and that we discovered them by using Fourier

Particularly, some new absolutely convergent series representations of
$\zeta(s)$ based on binomial expansion are presented. The crucial progress is
to find that $\zeta(s)$ can be expressed as a linear combination of polynomials
of infinite degree, whose consequences are shown in several aspects: (i)
numerically it provides a scenario to construct very fast convergent algorithm
to calculate $\zeta(s)$; (ii) interestingly it shows that Lagrange
interpolation using infinite number of integer Euler zeta functions reproduces
the exact complex $\zeta(s)$; (iii) surprisingly it demonstrates that
alternating Riemann zeta function (or other entire functions removing the pole
of zeta function) is admissible to Melzak combinatorial transform for
polynomials. Applying the functional symmetry on $\zeta(s)$ in the form of
Melzak transform induces $\zeta(s)$ being written as the difference of two
symmetrized factorials whose zeros are proved to all have real part of 1/2.
Furthermore, the two symmetrized factorials are proved to have interlacing
between the two sequences of the imaginary part of their zeros on upper (or
lower) half plane, which ensures the difference of the two symmetrized
factorials [proportional to $\zeta(s)$] attaining the same feature of zeros

nevertheless artificial in the sense that a rapid change in (at least) one of
the Hamiltonians is needed. The change must also occur at a very specific

eigenvalues of the output states. In the case where the number of unitary

extending the graphical Weingarten calculus introduced in Collins and Nechita

of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for the gluon propagator, particular to the

contributions turn out to be of paramount importance, modifying the qualitative
features of the full mass equation, and enabling the emergence of physically

gluon masses.

dense subgraphs, e.g., such a dense subgraph could reveal dense subtructures in

communication infrastructure. In this work, we address the problem of
self-awareness of nodes in a dynamic network with regards to graph density,
i.e., we give distributed algorithms for maintaining dense subgraphs that the
member nodes are aware of. The only knowledge that the nodes need is that of
the dynamic diameter $D$, i.e., the maximum number of rounds it takes for a
message to traverse the dynamic network. For our work, we consider a model
where the number of nodes are fixed, but a powerful adversary can add or remove
a limited number of edges from the network at each time step. The communication
is by broadcast only and follows the CONGEST model. Our algorithms are
continuously executed on the network, and at any time (after some
initialization) each node will be aware if it is part (or not) of a particular
dense subgraph. We give algorithms that ($2 + \epsilon$)-approximate the
densest subgraph and ($3 + \epsilon$)-approximate the at-least-$k$-densest
subgraph (for a given parameter $k$). Our algorithms work for a wide range of
parameter values and run in $O(D\log_{1+\epsilon} n)$ time. Further, a special

algorithms for densest and at-least-$k$-densest subgraph problems for static

model complexity to increase predictive power and the limited computational
resources for inference in the exponentially-sized output spaces such models
require. We formulate and develop the Structured Prediction Cascade
architecture: a sequence of increasingly complex models that progressively
filter the space of possible outputs. The key principle of our approach is that
each model in the cascade is optimized to accurately filter and refine the
structured output state space of the next model, speeding up both learning and
inference in the next layer of the cascade. We learn cascades by optimizing a
novel convex loss function that controls the trade-off between the filtering
efficiency and the accuracy of the cascade, and provide generalization bounds
for both accuracy and efficiency. We also extend our approach to intractable
models using tree-decomposition ensembles, and provide algorithms and theory
for this setting. We evaluate our approach on several large-scale problems,
achieving state-of-the-art performance in handwriting recognition and human
pose recognition. We find that structured prediction cascades allow tremendous
