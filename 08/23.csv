nonsymmetric matrix problems that typically arise in finite element

nonsymmetric one and a weighted least-squares version of it, is shown to be
convergent and provides a viable strategy for using nonsymmetric

in N=4 SYM dual to strings with no spin in AdS. We restrict our discussion for
operators inserted on a line. The string computation factorizes into a
state-dependent sphere part and a universal AdS contribution which depends only
on the dimensions of the operators and the cross ratios. We use the
integrability of the AdS string equations to compute the AdS part for operators
of arbitrary conformal dimensions. The solution takes the form of TBA-like
integral equations with the minimal AdS string-action computed by a
corresponding free-energy-like functional. These TBA-like equations stem from a
peculiar system of functional equations which we call a \chi-system. In
principle one could use the same method to solve for the AdS contribution in
the N-point function. An interesting feature of the solution is that it encodes
multiple string configurations corresponding to different classical
saddle-points. The discrete data that parameterizes these solutions enters
through the analog of the chemical-potentials in the TBA-like equations.
Finally, for operators dual to strings spinning in the same equator in S^5
(i.e. BPS operators of the same type) the sphere part is simple to compute. In
this case (which is generically neither extremal nor protected) we can
construct the complete, strong-coupling 4-point function.

It has long been suggested that circumstellar disks surrounding

create, according to models, large structures, gaps, rings or spirals, in the
disk. In that sense, the Herbig star HD 142527 is particularly compelling as,
its massive disk displays intriguing asymmetries that suggest the existence of
a dynamical peturber of unknown nature. Aims. Our goal was to obtain deep
thermal images of the close circumstellar environment of HD 142527 to re-image
the reported close-in structures (cavity, spiral arms) of the disk and to
search for stellar and substellar companions that could be connected to their
presence. Results. The circumstellar environment of HD 142527 is revealed at an
unprecedented spatial resolution down to the sub arcsecond level for the first
time at 3.8 microns. Our images reveal important radial and azimuthal
asymmetries which invalidate an elliptical shape for the disk as previously
proposed. It rather suggests a bright inhomogeneous spiral arm plus various
fainter spiral arms. We also confirm an inner cavity down to 30 AU and two
important dips at position angles of 0 and 135 deg. The detection performance
in angular differential imaging enables the exploration of the planetary mass
regime for projected physical separations as close as 40 AU. The use of our
detection map together with Monte Carlo simulations sets stringent constraints
on the presence of planetary mass, brown dwarf or stellar companions as a
function of the semi-major axis. They severely constrain the presence of
massive giant planets with semi-major axis beyond 50AU, i.e. probably within
the large disk's cavity that radially extends up to 145 AU or even further

anlaysis of the millimeter, far-infrared, and gamma-ray light curves show that
the variations were essentially simultaneous, indicative of co-spatiality of
the emission, at these wavebands. In contrast, differences in short-term
fluctuations at various wavelengths imply the presence of inhomegeneities in
physical conditions across the source. We locate the site of the outburst in
the parsec-scale core, whose flux density as measured on 7 mm Very Long
Baseline Array images increased by 70 percent during the first five weeks of

a model in which turbulent plasma crosses a conical standing shock in the

produced by inverse Compton scattering of seed photons supplied by either
nonthermal radiation from a Mach disk, thermal emission from hot dust, or (for
X-rays) synchrotron radiation from plasma that crosses the standing shock. For
the two dates on which we fitted the model SED to the data, the model
corresponds very well to the observations at all bands except at X-ray

trigonometric parallaxes, proper motions, and line-of-sight velocities. The
masers are distributed in a wide range of Galactocentric distances
$(3.5<R<13.2$ kpc) and are characterized by a wide scatter of position angles
$\theta$ in the Galactic XY plane. This has required an accurate allowance for
the dependence of the perturbation phase both on the logarithm of the
Galactocentric distances and on the position angles of the objects. To increase
the significance of the extraction of periodicities from data series with large
gaps, we have proposed and implemented a spectrum reconstruction method based
on a generalized maximum entropy method. As a result, we have extracted a
periodicity describing a spiral density wave with the following parameters from
the maser radial velocities: the perturbation amplitude $f_R =
7.7^{+1.7}_{-1.5}$ km s$^{-1}$, the perturbation wavelength
$\lambda=2.2^{+0.4}_{-0.1}$ kpc, the pitch angle of the spiral density wave
$i=-5^{+0.2^\circ}_{-0.9^\circ}$, and the phase of the Sun in the spiral
density wave $\chi_\odot= -147^{+3^\circ}_{-17^\circ}$.

macroscopic limit by the ergodic theorem. We show that the moment condition is
sharp by giving an explicit example of an equation whose ellipticity has a

XMM-Newton (~17 ksec) and Chandra (~300 ksec) data, and archival Swift/BAT data
from the 58-month catalog. The hard (>2 keV) X-ray spectrum of 4C+29.30 can be
decomposed into an intrinsic hard power-law (Gamma ~ 1.56) modified by a cold
absorber with an intrinsic column density N_{H,z} ~ 5x10^{23} cm^{-2}, and its
reflection (|Omega/2pi| ~ 0.3) from a neutral matter including a narrow iron
Kalpha emission line at the rest frame energy ~6.4 keV. The reflected component
is less absorbed than the intrinsic one with an upper limit on the absorbing
column of N^{refl}_{H,z} < 2.5x10^{22} cm^{-2}. The X-ray spectrum varied
between the XMM-Newton and Chandra observations. We show that a scenario
invoking variations of the normalization of the power-law is favored over a
model with variable intrinsic column density. X-rays in the 0.5-2 keV band are
dominated by diffuse emission modeled with a thermal bremsstrahlung component
with temperature ~0.7 keV, and contain only a marginal contribution from the
scattered power-law component. We hypothesize that 4C+29.30 belongs to a class
of `hidden' AGN containing a geometrically thick torus. However, unlike the
majority of them, 4C+29.30 is radio-loud. Correlations between the scattering
fraction and Eddington luminosity ratio, and the one between black hole mass
and stellar velocity dispersion, imply that 4C+29.30 hosts a black hole with
~10^8 M_{Sun} mass.

luminosities and morphologies from HST imaging, and black hole masses estimated
from optical and/or near-infrared spectroscopy. Our results are broadly
consistent with models in which most dust reddened quasars are an intermediate
phase between a merger-driven starburst triggering a completely obscured AGN,
and a normal, unreddened quasar. We find that many of our objects have high
accretion rates, close to the Eddington limit. These objects tend to fall below
the black hole mass -- bulge luminosity relation as defined by local galaxies,
whereas most of our low accretion rate objects are slightly above the local
relation, as typical for normal quasars at these redshifts. Our observations
are therefore most readily interpreted in a scenario in which galaxy stellar
mass growth occurs first by about a factor of three in each merger/starburst
event, followed sometime later by black hole growth by a similar amount. We do
not, however, see any direct evidence for quasar feedback affecting star
formation in our objects, for example in the form of a relationship between
accretion rate and star formation. Five of our objects, however, do show
evidence for outflows in the OIII 5007 Angstrom emission line profile,
suggesting that the quasar activity is driving thermal winds in at least some

  Sensitivity",,,,,"cs.CR cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the notion of restricted sensitivity as an alternative to global
and smooth sensitivity to improve accuracy in differentially private data
analysis. The definition of restricted sensitivity is similar to that of global
sensitivity except that instead of quantifying over all possible datasets, we
take advantage of any beliefs about the dataset that a querier may have, to
quantify over a restricted class of datasets. Specifically, given a query f and
a hypothesis H about the structure of a dataset D, we show generically how to
transform f into a new query f_H whose global sensitivity (over all datasets
including those that do not satisfy H) matches the restricted sensitivity of
the query f. Moreover, if the belief of the querier is correct (i.e., D is in
H) then f_H(D) = f(D). If the belief is incorrect, then f_H(D) may be
inaccurate.
  We demonstrate the usefulness of this notion by considering the task of
answering queries regarding social-networks, which we model as a combination of
a graph and a labeling of its vertices. In particular, while our generic
procedure is computationally inefficient, for the specific definition of H as
graphs of bounded degree, we exhibit efficient ways of constructing f_H using
different projection-based techniques. We then analyze two important query
classes: subgraph counting queries (e.g., number of triangles) and local
profile queries (e.g., number of people who know a spy and a computer-scientist
who know each other). We demonstrate that the restricted sensitivity of such
queries can be significantly lower than their smooth sensitivity. Thus, using
restricted sensitivity we can maintain privacy whether or not D is in H, while
providing more accurate results in the event that H holds true.

Schroedinger functional that is compatible with automatic O(a) improvement of
Wilson fermions up to O(a) boundary contributions. The elimination of bulk O(a)
effects requires the non-perturbative tuning of the critical mass and one
additional boundary counterterm. We present the results of such a tuning in a
quenched setup for several values of the renormalized gauge coupling, from
perturbative to non-perturbative regimes, and for a range of lattice spacings.
We also check that the correct boundary conditions and symmetries are restored

demonstrate that there are significant conceptual differences compared to more

neutrinos have traveled is limited by the Hubble length, which means that the
common belief that longer neutrino lifetimes can be probed by longer distances
does not apply. As a consequence, the neutrino lifetime limit from supernova
1987A cannot be exceeded by high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. We discuss the
implications for neutrino spectra and flavor ratios from gamma-ray bursts as
one example of extragalactic sources, using up-to-date neutrino flux
predictions. If the observation of SN 1987A implies that \nu_1 is stable and
the other mass eigenstates decay with rates much smaller than their current
bounds, the muon track rate can be substantially suppressed compared to the
cascade rate in the region IceCube is most sensitive to. In this scenario, no
gamma-ray burst neutrinos may be found using muon tracks even with the full
scale experiment, whereas reliable information on high-energy astrophysical
sources can only be obtained from cascade measurements. As another consequence,
the recently observed two cascade event candidates at PeV energies will not be
accompanied by corresponding muon tracks.

simulated Galaxy-scale halos in the standard CDM model of hierarchical
structure formation. This has been dubbed the ""too big to fail"" problem, with
reference to the improbability of large and invisible companions existing in
the Galactic environment. In this paper, we argue that both the Milky Way
observations and simulated subhalos are consistent with the predictions of the
standard model for structure formation. Specifically, we show that there is
significant variation in the properties of subhalos among distinct host halos
of fixed mass and suggest that this can reasonably account for the deficit of
dense satellites in the Milky Way. We exploit well-tested analytic techniques
to predict the properties in a large sample of distinct host halos with a
variety of masses spanning the range expected of the Galactic halo. The
analytic model produces subhalo populations consistent with both Via Lactea II
and Aquarius, and our results suggest that natural variation in subhalo
properties suffices to explain the discrepancy between Milky Way satellite
kinematics and these numerical simulations. At least ~10% of Milky Way-sized
halos host subhalo populations for which there is no ""too big to fail"" problem,
even when the host halo mass is as large as M_host = 10^12.2 h^-1 M_sun.
Follow-up studies consisting of high-resolution simulations of a large number
of Milky Way-sized hosts are necessary to confirm our predictions. In the
absence of such efforts, the ""too big to fail"" problem does not appear to be a
significant challenge to the standard model of hierarchical formation.

special choices of subsystems on which the entanglement is calculated, or real

these real space cuts is a quantum number indexing (if any) non-trivial
topology in these insulators. We explicitly show the number of protected in-gap
states is determined by a $Z^n$-index, $(z_1,...,z_n)$, where $z_m$ is the
number of occupied states that transform according to $m$-th one-dimensional
representation of the $C_n$ point group. We find that the entanglement spectrum
contains in-gap states pinned in an interval of entanglement eigenvalues
$[1/n,1-1/n]$. We determine the number of such in-gap states for an exhaustive

that in a homogeneous system, the $Z^n$ index can be determined through an
evaluation of the eigenvalues of point group symmetry operators at all
high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. When disordered $n$-fold
rotationally symmetric systems are considered, we find that the number of

dense gas that fuel star formation in our galaxy. While the H2 abundance is
ultimately regulated by physical processes operating on small scales in the
interstellar medium (ISM), observations have revealed a tight correlation
between the ratio of molecular to atomic hydrogen in nearby spiral galaxies and
the pressure in the mid-plane of their disks. This empirical relation has been
used to predict H2 abundances in galaxies with potentially very different ISM
conditions, such as metal-deficient galaxies at high redshifts. Here, we test
the validity of this approach by studying the dependence of the pressure -- H2
relation on environmental parameters of the ISM. To this end, we follow the
formation and destruction of H2 explicitly in a suite of hydrodynamical
simulations of galaxies with different ISM parameters. We find that a pressure
-- H2 relation arises naturally in our simulations for a variety of dust-to-gas
ratios or strengths of the interstellar radiation field in the ISM. Fixing the
dust-to-gas ratio and the UV radiation field to values measured in the solar
neighborhood results in fair agreement with the relation observed in nearby
galaxies with roughly solar metallicity. However, the parameters (slope and
normalization) of the pressure -- H2 relation vary in a systematical way with
ISM properties. A particularly strong trend is the decrease of the
normalization of the relation with a lowering of the dust-to-gas ratio of the
ISM. We show that this trend and other properties of the pressure -- H2
relation are natural consequences of the transition from atomic to molecular
hydrogen with gas surface density.

MIPSGAL, and IRAS surveys to construct total emission spectra, as well as
longitude and latitude profiles for the emission. The distribution of stars and
dust is taken from the SKY model, and the dust emissivities includes an
approximation of the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in addition
to thermal emission. The model emission is in broad agreement with the
observations, but a few modifications are needed to obtain a good fit. Firstly,
by adjusting the model to include two major and two minor spiral arms rather
than four equal spiral arms, the fit to the longitude profiles for |l|>30
degrees can be improved. Secondly, introducing a deficit in the dust
distribution in the inner Galaxy results in a better fit to the shape of the
IRAS longitude profiles at 60 and 100 microns. With these modifications, the
model fits the observed profiles well, although it systematically
under-estimates the 5.8 and 8.0 microns fluxes. One way to resolve this
discrepancy is to increase the abundance of PAH molecules by 50% compared to
the original model, although we note that changes to the dust distribution or
radiation field may provide alternative solutions. Finally, we use the model to
quantify which stellar populations contribute the most to the heating of
different dust types, and which stellar populations and dust types contribute

We present the first complete quantitative study of the parameter space of the

This requires to track the time evolution of left and right handed neutrino

flavour oscillations, scatterings and decays leads to a number of previously
unknown constraints on the sterile neutrino properties. We furthermore

matter with gravitational strength, but whose manifestation depends on the
ambient matter density. A key feature is that the screening mechanism
suppressing its effects in high-density environments is determined by the local
scalar field value. Under very general conditions, we prove two theorems
limiting its cosmological impact: i) the Compton wavelength of such a scalar
can be at most Mpc at present cosmic density, which restricts its impact to
non-linear scales; ii) the conformal factor relating Einstein- and Jordan-frame
scale factors is essentially constant over the last Hubble time, which
precludes the possibility of self-acceleration. These results imply that
chameleon-like scalar fields have a negligible effect on the linear-scale
growth history; theories that invoke a chameleon-like scalar to explain cosmic
acceleration rely on a form of dark energy rather than a genuine modified
gravity effect. Our analysis applies to a broad class of chameleon, symmetron
and dilaton theories.

convergence conditions other than or besides monotonicity. We show such a
property holds for which the sequence of $n^{th}$ roots does converge, even if
one has no a priori knowledge as to whether the sequence is monotone or not. We
show also the $n^{th}$ root of the diagonal Ramsey number can be expressed as a
product of two factors, the first being a known convergent sequence and the
second being an absolutely convergent infinite series. One also can express it
where one product is convergent and the other has all its values from a
uniformly convergent complex function holomorphic within the unit disc on the
complex plane. Our motivation solely is to prove the conjecture as a problem in
search of a solution, not to establish some deep theory about graphs. A second
question is: If the limit exists what is it? At the time of this writing the
understanding is the proofs sought need not be constructive. Here we show by
nonconstructive proofs that the $n^{th}$ root of the diagonal Ramsey number

modeling (based on plausible projectile sources and their dynamical decay
rates) with constraints from the lunar crater record, radiometric ages of the
youngest lunar basins, and the abundance of highly siderophile elements in the
lunar crust and mantle. We deduce that the evolution of the impact flux did not
decline exponentially over the first billion years of lunar history, but also
there was no prominent and ""narrow"" impact spike some 3.9 Gy ago, unlike that
typically envisioned in the lunar cataclysm scenario. Instead, we show the
timeline of the lunar bombardment has a sawtooth-like profile, with an uptick
in the impact flux near 4.1 Gy ago. The impact flux at the beginning of this
weaker cataclysm was 5-10 times higher than the immediately preceding period.
The Nectaris basin should have been one of the first basins formed at the
sawtooth. We predict the bombardment rate since about 4.1Gy ago declined slowly
and adhered relatively close to classic crater chronology models (Neukum and
Ivanov (1994)). Overall we expect that the sawtooth event accounted for about
1/4 of the total bombardment suffered by the Moon since its formation.
Consequently, considering that about 12-14 basins formed during the sawtooth
event, we expect that the net number of basins formed on the Moon was about
45-50. From our expected bombardment timeline, we derived a new and improved
lunar chronology suitable for use on Pre-Nectarian surface units. According to
this chronology, a significant portion of the oldest lunar cratered terrains
has an age of 4.38-4.42 Gyr. Moreover, the largest lunar basin, South Pole
Aitken, is older than 4.3Gy, and therefore was not produced during the lunar
cataclysm.

redistribute metals. However, the nature of this mechanism is poorly
understood, let alone quantified. To address this problem, we conduct
magnetohydrodynamical simulations of a local shearing sheet of a thin,
thermally unstable, gaseous disk driven by a background stellar spiral
potential, including metals modeled as passive scalar fields. Contrary to what
a simple \alpha\ prescription for the gas disk would suggest, we find that
turbulence driven by thermal instability is very efficient at mixing metals,
regardless of the presence or absence of stellar spiral potentials or magnetic
fields. The timescale for homogenizing randomly distributed metals is
comparable to or less than the local orbital time in the disk. This implies
that turbulent mixing of metals is a significant process in the history of
chemical evolution of disk galaxies.

variability of UV stellar wind lines occurring symmetric about the approximate

variability the B1/B2V star sigma Lupi emerged as a new magnetic candidate
star. AAT spectropolarimetric measurements with SEMPOL were obtained. The
longitudinal component of the magnetic field integrated over the visible
surface of the star was determined with the Least-Squares Deconvolution method.
The UV line variations of sigma Lupi are similar to what is known in magnetic B
stars, but no periodicity could be determined. We detected a varying
longitudinal magnetic field with amplitude of about 100 G with error bars of
typically 20 G, which supports an oblique magnetic-rotator configuration. The
EW variations of the UV lines, the magnetic and the optical-line variations are
consistent with the photometric period of 3.02 d, which we identify with the
rotation period of the star. Additional observations with ESPaDOnS attached to
the CFHT confirmed this discovery, and allowed the determination of a precise
magnetic period. Analysis revealed that sigma Lupi is a He-strong star, with an
enhanced N abundance and an underabundance of C, and has a chemically spotted
surface. Like in other magnetic B stars the UV wind emission appears to
originate close to the magnetic equatorial plane, with maximum emission when a
magnetic pole points towards the Earth. The 3.01972(43) d magnetic rotation
period is consistent with the photometric period, with maximum light

the turns from this state. If a slinky is suspended from its top and stretched
under gravity and then released, the bottom of the slinky does not begin to
fall until the top section of the slinky, which collapses turn by turn from the
top, collides with the bottom. The total collapse time t_c (typically ~0.3 s
for real slinkies) corresponds to the time required for a wave front to
propagate down the slinky to communicate the release of the top end. We present
a modification to an existing model for a falling tension spring (Calkin 1993)
and apply it to data from filmed drops of two real slinkies. The modification
of the model is the inclusion of a finite time for collapse of the turns of the
slinky behind the collapse front propagating down the slinky during the fall.
The new finite-collapse time model achieves a good qualitative fit to the
observed positions of the top of the real slinkies during the measured drops.
The spring constant k for each slinky is taken to be a free parameter in the
model. The best-fit model values for k for each slinky are approximately
consistent with values obtained from measured periods of oscillation of the

explores service-oriented abstractions such as service adaptation, discovery,

adaptive object-oriented groups which offer services to their environment.
These groups fit directly into the object-oriented paradigm in the sense that
they can be dynamically created, they have an identity, and they can receive
method calls. In contrast to objects, groups are not used for structuring code.
A group exports its services through interfaces and relies on objects to
implement these services. Objects may join or leave different groups. Groups
may dynamically export new interfaces, they support service discovery, and they
can be queried at runtime for the interfaces they support. We define an
operational semantics and a static type system for this model of adaptive
object groups, and show that well-typed programs do not cause

radiometric ages over a wide range of closure temperatures are available. A
thermal evolution model for the H chondrite parent body is constructed by using
all H chondrites for which at least three different radiometric ages are
available. Several key parameters determining the thermal evolution of the H

varied until an optimal fit is obtained. The fit is performed by an 'evolution

parameters for the H chondrite parent body is found that yields excellent
agreement (within error bounds) between the thermal evolution model and
empirical data of six of the examined eight chondrites. The new thermal model
constrains the radius and formation time of the H chondrite parent body

suggests that at least some of these sources are in fact close binaries. Two
out of the four MS stars also show significant infrared excesses typical of
circumstellar disks. Extinctions and distances were determined for each MS star
by fitting model stellar atmospheres to the SEDs. We estimate a distance to the

the dominant source of LyC luminosity needed to power the W40 HII region and is

background environments can affect the star and planet formation processes
occurring within them. In turn, young stellar members can shape the background
environment and thereby provide a feedback mechanism. This work explores one
aspect of stellar feedback by quantifying the background X-ray radiation fields
produced by young stellar objects. Specifically, the distributions of X-ray
luminosities and X-ray fluxes produced by cluster environments are constructed
as a function of cluster membership size $N$. Composite flux distributions, for
given distributions of cluster sizes $N$, are also constructed. The resulting
distributions are wide and the X-ray radiation fields are moderately intense,
with the expected flux levels exceeding the cosmic and galactic X-ray
backgrounds by factors of $\sim10-1000$ (for energies 0.2 -- 15 keV). For
circumstellar disks that are geometrically thin and optically thick, the X-ray
flux from the background cluster dominates that provided by a typical central
star in the outer disk where $r \ga 9 - 14$ AU. In addition, the expectation
value of the ionization rate provided by the cluster X-ray background is
$\zeta_X\sim8\times10^{-17}$ s$^{-1}$, about 4 -- 8 times larger than the
canonical value of the ionization rate from cosmic rays. These elevated flux
levels in clusters indicate that X-rays can affect ionization, chemistry, and
heating in circumstellar disks and in the material between young stellar
objects.

to blueshifted (-160 km s-1) gas at a temperature of ~ 270 K absorbing at
velocities as high as -400 km s-1. A much weaker but even warmer (~ 700 K)
component, which is highly redshifted (+100 km s-1), is also detected, in
addition to a cold (~ 20 K) component centered at the systemic velocity of the
galaxy. On the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium, the column
density of CO in the 270 K component is NCO ~ 4.5 x 10^18 cm-2, which in fully
molecular gas corresponds to a H2 column density of NH2 ~ 2.5 x 10^22 cm-2. The
thermal excitation of CO up to the observed high rotational levels requires a
density greater than nc(H2) > 2 x 10^7 cm-3, implying that the thickness of the
warm absorbing layer is extremely small (delta_d < 4 x 10-2 pc) even if it is
highly clumped. The large column densities and high radial velocities
associated with these warm components, as well as their temperatures, indicate
that they originate in molecular clouds near the central engine of the AGN.

Solutions include adaptive optics (but not providing full correction for short
wavelengths) or image slicers (which give feasible but still large
instruments). Here we develop the solution proposed by Bland-Hawthorn and
Horton: the use of diffraction-limited spectrographs which are compact even for
high resolving power. Their use is made possible by the photonic lantern, which
splits a multi-mode optical fiber into a number of single-mode fibers. We
describe preliminary designs for such spectrographs, at a resolving power of R
~ 50,000. While they are small and use relatively simple optics, the challenges
are to accommodate the longest possible fiber slit (hence maximum number of
single-mode fibers in one spectrograph) and to accept the beam from each fiber
at a focal ratio considerably faster than for most spectrograph collimators,
while maintaining diffraction-limited imaging quality. It is possible to obtain
excellent performance despite these challenges. We also briefly consider the
number of such spectrographs required, which can be reduced by full or partial
adaptive optics correction, and/or moving towards longer wavelengths.

selectable filter on a filter wheel mechanism; gratings are available in the
filter wheels of FUV and NUV channels for slit-less low resolution
spectroscopy. The detector system for each of the 3 channels is generically
identical. One telescope images in the FUV channel, and other images in NUV and

of the thickness of insulating spacer between single layer graphene and Au

thickness of the spacer layer increases from 0 to 15 nm. This is due to the
electromagnetic coupling between the localized surface plasmons excited in the
nanoparticles and the graphene film. The strength of the coupling decays
exponentially with a decay length of d/R=0.36, where d is the spacer layer
thickness and R is the diameter of the Au nanoparticles. The result agrees
qualitatively well with the plasmon ruler equation. Interestingly, a further
increment of the spacer layer thickness induces a red shift of 17 nm in the

with mass dimension one to the O'Raifeartaigh model to study supersymmetry
breaking for fermionic fields with mass dimension one.
  We find that the coupled model has two distinct solutions. The first solution
represents a local minimum of the superpotential which spontaneously breaks
supersymmetry in perfect analogy to the O'Raifeartaigh model. The second
solution is more intriguing as it corresponds to a global minimum of the
superpotential. In this case the coupling to the fermionic sector restores
supersymmetry. However, this is achieved at the cost of breaking Lorentz
invariance. Finally, the mass matrices for the multiplets of the coupled model
are presented. It turns out that it contains two bosonic triplets and one
fermionic doublet which are mass multiplets. In addition it contains a massless
fermionic doublet as well as one fermionic triplet which is not a mass
multiplet but rather an interaction multiplet that contains component fields of
different mass dimension.
  These results show that the presented model for fermionic fields with mass
dimension one is a viable candidate for supersymmetric dark matter that could
be accessible to experiments in the near future.

problem. Recently, Lambrechts and Johansen (2012; LJ12) proposed a new model in
which the cores grow by the accretion of pebble-size objects, as the latter
drift towards the star due to gas drag. Here, we investigate the dynamics of
pebble-size objects in the vicinity of planetary embryos of 1 and 5 Earth
masses and the resulting accretion rates. We use hydrodynamical simulations, in
which the embryo influences the dynamics of the gas and the pebbles suffer gas
drag according to the local gas density and velocities. The pebble dynamics in
the vicinity of the planetary embryo is non-trivial, and it changes
significantly with the pebble size. Nevertheless, the accretion rate of the
embryo that we measure is within an order of magnitude of the rate estimated in
LJ12 and tends to their value with increasing pebble-size. We conclude that the
model by LJ12 has the potential to explain the rapid growth of giant planet
cores. The actual accretion rates however, depend on the surface density of
pebble size objects in the disk, which is unknown to date.

transfer (RT) modelling, we have developed a new set of diagnostic diagrams in
the infrared colour-colour plane (K-[24] vs. K-[8]), to aid with the
classiffication of the evolutionary stage of YSOs from photometric
observations. Our diagrams allow the differentiation of sources with un-evolved
(primordial) discs from those evolving according to different clearing
scenarios (e.g. homologous depletion vs. inside-out dispersal), as well as from
sources that have already lost their disc. Classification of over 1500 sources
in 15 nearby star-forming regions reveals that approximately 39% of the sources
lie in the primordial disc region, whereas between 31% and 32% disperse from
the inside-out and up to 22% of the sources have already lost their disc. Less
than 2% of the objects in our sample lie in the homogeneous draining regime.
Time-scales for the transition phase are estimated to be typically a few 10^5
years independent of stellar mass. Therefore, regardless of spectral type, we
conclude that currently available infrared photometric surveys point to fast
(of order 10% of the global disc lifetime) inside-out clearing as the preferred
mode of disc dispersal.

magnetic shifts and linewidths for an optimally doped and an underdoped
HgBa$_{2}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ single crystal, as well as the quadrupole splitting
and its distribution for $^{63}$Cu. From the $^{63}$Cu and $^{199}$Hg
\textit{magnetic shifts} we have recently concluded on the existence of two
spin components with different temperature dependencies [J. Haase, D. Rybicki,
C. P. Slichter, M. Greven, G. Yu, Y. Li, and X. Zhao, Phys. Rev. B 85, 104517
(2012)]. Here we give a comprehensive account of all data and focus on the
linewidths and quadrupole splittings. While the $^{63}$Cu quadrupole coupling
and its distribution are by and large temperature independent, we identify
three regions in temperature for which the magnetic widths differ
significantly: at the lowest temperatures the magnetic linewidths are dominated
by the rigid fluxoid lattice that seems to have disappeared above about 60 K.
In the intermediate temperature region, starting above 60 K, the magnetic
linewidth is dominated by the spatial distribution of the magnetic shift due to
the pseudogap spin component, and grows linearly with the total shift up to
about \textit{$\sim$}170-230 K, depending on sample and nucleus. Above this
temperature the third region begins with an sudden narrowing where the second,
Fermi-liquid-like spin component becomes homogeneous. We show that all
linewidths, quadrupolar as well as magnetic, above the fluxoid dominated region
can be understood with a simple model that assumes a coherent charge density
variation with concomitant variations of the two spin components. In addition,
we find a temperature independent spin based broadening in both samples that is
incoherent with the other broadening for the underdoped crystal, but becomes
coherent for the optimally doped crystal.

field. In most areas in the corona magnetic forces are so dominant that all
non-magnetic forces like plasma pressure gradient and gravity can be neglected
in the lowest order. This model assumption is called the force-free field
assumption, as the Lorentz force vanishes. This can be obtained by either
vanishing electric currents (leading to potential fields) or the currents are
co-aligned with the magnetic field lines. First we discuss a mathematically
simpler approach that the magnetic field and currents are proportional with one
global constant, the so-called linear force-free field approximation. In the
generic case, however, the relation between magnetic fields and electric
currents is nonlinear and analytic solutions have been only found for special
cases, like 1D or 2D configurations. For constructing realistic nonlinear
force-free coronal magnetic field models in 3D, sophisticated numerical
computations are required and boundary conditions must be obtained from
measurements of the magnetic field vector in the solar photosphere. This
approach is currently of large interests, as accurate measurements of the
photospheric field become available from ground-based (for example SOLIS) and
space-born (for example Hinode and SDO) instruments. If we can obtain accurate
force-free coronal magnetic field models we can calculate the free magnetic
energy in the corona, a quantity which is important for the prediction of
flares and coronal mass ejections. Knowledge of the 3D structure of magnetic
field lines also help us to interpret other coronal observations, e.g.,

and velocity. These variables vary on different time scales and the challenge
is to distinguish different spatial flow regimes.
  For Fram Strait, a temperature criterion is traditionally applied to identify
water-masses, i.e. water volumes of similar origin. Interpolation leads to a
vertical latitudinal 2D cross-section from which a scalar - the hypothetical
area of waters within a certain temperature interval - can be extracted. The
scalar is combined with a similar interpolation of the velocities to
approximate the volume flows through the gateway. This approach is not only
numerically expensive but also incorporates many assumptions. The present study
suggest a new network-based approach to discriminate between flow regimes
without the need to introduce artificial data through interpolation. The new
approach not only reproduces the known flow patterns, but also reveals
topographical features which are not captured by a standard water-masses
analysis.

Cyg-like sources are similar, the results indicating an increase of mass
accretion rate Mdot between soft and hard apex, not as in the standard view
that this increases around the Z. In the Cyg-like sources, increasing Mdot
causes the neutron star temperature kT to increase from ~1 to ~2 keV. At the
lower kT, the radiation pressure is small, but at the higher kT, the emitted
flux of the neutron star is several times super-Eddington and the high
radiation pressure disrupts the inner disk launching the relativistic jets
observed on the upper normal and horizontal branches. In the Sco-like sources,
the main physical difference is the high kT of more than 2 keV on all parts of
the Z-track suggesting that jets are always possible, even on the flaring
branch. The flaring branch in the Cyg-like sources is associated with release
of energy on the neutron star consistent with unstable nuclear burning. The
Sco-like sources are very different as flaring appears to be a combination of
unstable burning and an increase of Mdot which makes flaring much stronger.
Analysis of 15 years or RXTE ASM data on all 6 classic Z-track sources shows
the high rate and strength of flaring in the Sco-like sources suggesting that
continual release of energy heats the neutron star causing the high kT. A Sco
X-1 observation with unusually little flaring supports this. GX 17+2 appears to
be transitional between the Cyg and Sco-like types. Our results do not support
the suggestion that Cyg or Sco-like nature is determined by luminosity.

q-observable functions with compact image on non-zero projections. These

naturally seen as adjoints (in the categorical sense) of spectral families. We
show how they relate to the daseinisation mapping from the topos approach to
quantum theory. Moreover, the q-observable functions form a conditionally
complete lattice which is shown to be order-isomorphic to the lattice of
self-adjoint operators with respect to the spectral order. In a subsequent
paper, we will give an interpretation of q-observable functions in terms of
quantum probability theory, and using results from the topos approach to

robustness of Hawking-like particle creation is investigated in flows with a
single black hole horizon. Furthermore, we find that condensates with two

gravity, we also show that warp drives, which are general relativistic

Simulator (4FS) has several roles, firstly to optimise the design of the

reference surveys that are proposed for 4MOST, and thirdly to verify that
4MOST, as designed, can indeed achieve its primary science goals. We describe
the overall structure of the 4FS, together with details of some important 4FS
subsystems. We present the initial results from the 4FS which illustrate
clearly the value of having a functioning facility simulator very early in the

(CFE). It starts by suggesting that, to emphasize common properties in relation
to CFE theory, the term 'Lauritsen plot' could be used to describe all
graphical plots made with the reciprocal of barrier field (or the reciprocal of
a quantity proportional to barrier field) on the horizontal axis. It then
argues that Lauritsen plots related to barrier strength (G) and transmission
probability (D) could play a useful role in discussion of CFE theory. Such
plots would supplement conventional Fowler-Nordheim (FN) plots. All these plots
would be regarded as particular types of Lauritsen plot. The Lauritsen plots of
-G and lnD can be used to illustrate how basic aspects of FN tunnelling theory
are influenced by the mathematical form of the tunnelling barrier. These, in
turn, influence local emission current density and emission current.
Illustrative applications used in this note relate to the well-known exact
triangular and Schottky-Nordheim barriers, and to the Coulomb barrier (i.e.,
the electrostatic component of the electron potential energy barrier outside a
model spherical emitter). For the Coulomb barrier, a good analytical series
approximation has been found for the barrier-form correction factor; this can
be used to predict the existence (and to some extent the properties) of related
curvature in FN plots.

with different EV battery charging rate constraints, that is distributed across
a smart power grid network requires a coordinated charging schedule to minimize
the power generation and EV charging costs. In this paper, we study a joint
optimal power flow (OPF) and EV charging problem that augments the OPF problem
with charging EVs over time. While the OPF problem is generally nonconvex and
nonsmooth, it is shown recently that the OPF problem can be solved optimally
for most practical power networks using its convex dual problem. Building on
this zero duality gap result, we study a nested optimization approach to
decompose the joint OPF and EV charging problem. We characterize the optimal
offline EV charging schedule to be a valley-filling profile, which allows us to
develop an optimal offline algorithm with computational complexity that is
significantly lower than centralized interior point solvers. Furthermore, we
propose a decentralized online algorithm that dynamically tracks the
valley-filling profile. Our algorithms are evaluated on the IEEE 14 bus system,
and the simulations show that the online algorithm performs almost near
optimality ($<1%$ relative difference from the offline optimal solution) under
different settings.

QPC's confinement potential may enable the high g* desirable for spintronic

satisfying $$\|\nu(A\cup B)-\nu(A)-\nu(B)\|\leq 1\quad{for

is valid when restricted to set algebras $\mathcal F$ of cardinality less than
some fixed cardinal number $\kappa$, then we say that $X$ has the

$\mathsf{SVM}$ character of $X$. We apply the machinery of twisted sums and
quasi-linear maps to characterise these properties and to determine
$\mathsf{SVM}$ characters for many classical Banach spaces. We also discuss
connections between the $\kappa$-$\mathsf{SVM}$ property, $\kappa$-injectivity

Z(N) of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) on a regular lattice by the length-doubling

discuss an algorithm for the creation of all SAWs of length N, efficient
storage of these SAWs in a tree data structure, and an algorithm for the
computation of correction terms to the count Z(2N) for SAWs of double length,
removing all combinations of two intersecting single-length SAWs.
  We present an efficient numbering of the lattice sites that enables
exploitation of symmetry and leads to a smaller tree data structure; this
numbering is by increasing Euclidean distance from the origin of the lattice.
Furthermore, we show how the computation can be parallelised by distributing
the iterations of the main loop of the algorithm over the cores of a multicore
architecture. Experimental results on the 3D cubic lattice demonstrate that
Z(28) can be computed on a dual-core PC in only 1 hour and 40 minutes, with a
speedup of 1.56 compared to the single-core computation and with a gain by
using symmetry of a factor of 26. We present results for memory use and show

Magnetization experiments evidence that annealing of RbxFe2-ySe2 at 413 K, well
below the onset of phase separation Tp=489 K, neither changes the magnetic nor
the superconducting properties of the crystals. In addition, annealing at 563
K, well above Tp, suppresses the superconducting transition temperature Tc and
leads to an increase of the antiferromagnetic susceptibility accompanied by the
creation of ferromagnetic impurity phases, which are developing with annealing
time. However, annealing at T=488K=Tp increases Tc up to 33.3 K, sharpens the
superconducting transition, increases the lower critical field, and strengthens
the screening efficiency of the applied magnetic field. Resistivity
measurements of the as-grown and optimally annealed samples reveal an increase
of the upper critical field along both crystallographic directions as well as
its anisotropy. Muon spin rotation and scanning transmission electron
microscopy experiments suggest the coexistence of two phases below Tp: a
magnetic majority phase of Rb2Fe4Se5 and a non-magnetic minority phase of
Rb0.5Fe2Se2. Both microscopic techniques indicate that annealing the specimens
just at Tp does not affect the volume fraction of the two phases, although the
magnetic field distribution in the samples changes substantially. This suggests
that the microstructure of the sample, caused by mesoscopic phase separation,
is modified by annealing just at Tp, leading to an improvement of the
superconducting properties of RbxFe2-ySe2 and an enhancement of Tc.

  Policies and Direct Policy Search","In Submission",,,,"cs.SY cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Direct policy search (DPS) and look-ahead tree (LT) policies are two widely
used classes of techniques to produce high performance policies for sequential
decision-making problems. To make DPS approaches work well, one crucial issue
is to select an appropriate space of parameterized policies with respect to the
targeted problem. A fundamental issue in LT approaches is that, to take good
decisions, such policies must develop very large look-ahead trees which may
require excessive online computational resources. In this paper, we propose a
new hybrid policy learning scheme that lies at the intersection of DPS and LT,
in which the policy is an algorithm that develops a small look-ahead tree in a
directed way, guided by a node scoring function that is learned through DPS.
The LT-based representation is shown to be a versatile way of representing
policies in a DPS scheme, while at the same time, DPS enables to significantly
reduce the size of the look-ahead trees that are required to take high-quality
decisions.
  We experimentally compare our method with two other state-of-the-art DPS
techniques and four common LT policies on four benchmark domains and show that
it combines the advantages of the two techniques from which it originates. In
particular, we show that our method: (1) produces overall better performing
policies than both pure DPS and pure LT policies, (2) requires a substantially
smaller number of policy evaluations than other DPS techniques, (3) is easy to
tune and (4) results in policies that are quite robust with respect to
perturbations of the initial conditions.

the model of Spahn and Sremcevic (2000) to include the vertical direction. We
find that the gravitational interaction of ring particles with the non-inclined
moonlet does not induce considerable vertical excursions of ring particles, but
causes a considerable thermal motion in the ring plane. We expect ring particle
collisions to partly convert the lateral induced thermal motion into vertical
excursions of ring particles. For the gap region of the propeller, we calculate
gap averaged propeller heights on the order of 0.7 Hill radii, which is of the
order of the moonlet radius. In our model the propeller height decreases
exponentially until viscous heating and collisional cooling balance. We
estimate Hill radii of 370m and 615m for the propellers Earhart and Bleriot.

block-fading channel. In here, the transmitters have access to only their own
fading coefficients, while the receiver has global access to all the fading
coefficients. Outage is not permitted in any communication block. The resulting
average sum-throughput is also known as `power-controlled adaptive
sum-capacity', which appears as an open problem in literature.
  This paper presents the power-controlled adaptive sum-capacity of a
wide-class of popular MAC models. In particular, we propose a power-rate
strategy in the presence of distributed channel state information (CSI), which
is throughput optimal when all the users have identical channel statistics. The
proposed scheme also has an efficient implementation using successive
cancellation and rate-splitting. We propose an upperbound when the channel laws
are not identical. Furthermore, the optimal schemes are extended to situations
in which each transmitter has additional finite-rate partial CSI on the link
quality of others.

baseband signal (information) into a carrier wave so that it can be
successfully broadcasted through a medium such as air or cables. A flexible
signal modulation scheme is hence essential to wide range of applications based
on flexible electronics. Here we report a fully bendable all-graphene modulator
circuit with the capability to encode a carrier signal with quaternary digital
information for the first time. By exploiting the ambipolarity and the
nonlinearity in a graphene transistor, we demonstrated two types of quaternary
modulation schemes: 4-ary amplitude-shift keying (4-ASK) and quadrature
phase-shift keying (QPSK). Remarkably, 4-ASK and QPSK can be realized with just
1 and 2 all-graphene transistors, respectively, representing a drastic
reduction in circuit complexity when compared with conventional digital
modulators. In addition, the circuit is not only flexible but also highly
transparent (~95% transmittance) owing to their all-graphene design with every
component (channel, interconnects, load resistor, and source/drain/gate
electrodes) fabricated from graphene films. Taken together, these results
represent a significant step toward achieving a high speed communication system
that can be monolithically integrated on a flexible and transparent platform.

interstellar medium (ISM) physics on Lyman-alpha (Lya) radiation transfer and
to quantify how galaxy orientation with respect to the line of sight alters
observational signatures. Methods. We compare the results of Lya radiation
transfer calculations through the ISM of a couple of idealized galaxy
simulations with different ISM models. Results. First, the small-scale
structuration of the ISM plays a determinant role in shaping a galaxys Lya
properties.The artificially warm, and hence smooth, ISM of G1 yields an escape
fraction of 50 percent at the Lya line center, and produces symmetrical
double-peak profiles. On the contrary, in G2, most young stars are embedded in
thick star-forming clouds, and the result is a 10 times lower escape fraction.
G2 also displays a stronger outflowing velocity field, which favors the escape
of red-shifted photons, resulting in an asymmetric Lya line. Second, the Lya
properties of G2 strongly depend on the inclination at which it is observed:
From edge-on to face-on, the line goes from a double-peak profile with an
equivalent width of -5 Angstrom to a 15 times more luminous red-shifted
asymmetric line with EW 90 Angstrom. Conclusions. Lya radiation transfer
calculations can only lead to realistic properties in simulations where
galaxies are resolved into giant molecular clouds, putting these calculations
out of reach of current large scale cosmological simulations. Finally, we find
inclination effects to be much stronger for Lya photons than for continuum
radiation. This could potentially introduce severe biases in the selection
function of narrow-band Lya emitter surveys, which could indeed miss a
significant fraction of the high-z galaxy population.

suggest that the topological structure of the QCD vacuum is dominated by
codimension-one membranes which appear as thin dipole layers of topological
charge. Such membranes arise naturally as $D6$ branes in the holographic
formulation of QCD based on IIA string theory. The polarizability of these
membranes leads to a vacuum energy $\propto \theta^2$, providing the origin of
nonzero topological susceptibility. Here we show that the axial U(1) anomaly
can be formulated as anomaly inflow on the brane surfaces. A 4D gauge
transformation at the brane surface separates into a 3D gauge transformation of
components within the brane and the transformation of the transverse component.
The in-brane gauge transformation induces currents of an effective Chern-Simons
theory on the brane surface, while the transformation of the transverse
component describes the transverse motion of the brane and is related to the
Ramond-Ramond closed string field in the holographic formulation of QCD. The
relation between the surface currents and the transverse motion of the brane is
dictated by the descent equations of Yang-Mills theory.

size and have been test-beds for addressing a range of elusive but important
phenomena in quantum dynamics. In fact, for short-enough timescales the spin
wavefunctions evolve coherently according to the an appropriate cluster
spin-Hamiltonian, whose structure can be tailored at the synthetic level to
meet specific requirements. Unfortunately, to this point it has been impossible
to determine the spin dynamics directly. If the molecule is sufficiently
simple, the spin motion can be indirectly assessed by an approximate model
Hamiltonian fitted to experimental measurements of various types. Here we show
that recently-developed instrumentation yields the four-dimensional
inelastic-neutron scattering function S(Q,E) in vast portions of reciprocal
space and enables the spin dynamics to be determined with no need of any model
Hamiltonian. We exploit the Cr8 antiferromagnetic ring as a benchmark to
demonstrate the potential of this new approach. For the first time we extract a
model-free picture of the quantum dynamics of a molecular nanomagnet. This
allows us, for example, to examine how a quantum fluctuation propagates along
the ring and to directly test the degree of validity of the
N\'{e}el-vector-tunneling description of the spin dynamics.
