the transition region and the top of chromosphere. The realistic 3D magnetic
field is simulated using the data from the photospheric magnetic field
measurements. The distinctive feature of the new model is incorporating the MHD
Alfven wave turbulence. We assume this turbulence and its non-linear
dissipation to be the only momentum and energy source for heating the coronal
plasma and driving the solar wind. The difference between the turbulence
dissipation efficiency in coronal holes and that in closed field regions is
because the non-linear cascade rate degrades in strongly anisotropic turbulence
in coronal holes (no inward propagating wave), thus resulting in colder coronal
holes with the bi-modal solar wind originating from them. The detailed
presentation of the theoretical model is illustrated with the synthetic images
for multi-wavelength EUV emission compared with the observations from SDO AIA
and Stereo EUVI instruments for the Carrington rotation 2107.

  Il lavoro della presente tesi \`e focalizzato sullo studio dello spettro di
eccitazione di sistemi isolati spin polarizzati. Quindi vengono esposte la
Density Functional Theory (DFT), la sua estensione al caso dipendente dal tempo
(TDDFT) e le approssimazioni utilizzate. In particolare vien esposta la
formulazione di Casida della TDDFT. Le equazioni per lo studio di sistemi
spin-polarizzati sono state implementate all'interno del software ABINIT. \`E
stata poi scelta la molecola di BeH per testare l'implementazione fatta. I
calcoli eseguiti ci hanno permesso di mettere in luce i limiti delle
approssimazioni comunemente utilizzate. In particolare abbiamo discusso
l'impossibilit\`a di mantenere la corretta simmetria di spin in sistemi spin
polarizzati. Viene quindi proposta una regola per individuare quali siano,
negli spettri calcolati, le energie di eccitazione affette da questo problema.
Nell'ultimo capitolo della tesi viene inoltre esposta una possibile soluzione
per superare l'approssimazione adiabatica.

rewriting operations is a natural and convenient approach tom odeling
chemistry. Graph grammar rules are most naturally employed to model elementary
reactions like merging, splitting, and isomerisation of molecules. It is often
convenient, in particular in the analysis of larger systems, to summarize
several subsequent reactions into a single composite chemical reaction. We use
a generic approach for composing graph grammar rules to define a chemically
useful rule compositions. We iteratively apply these rule compositions to
elementary transformations in order to automatically infer complex
transformation patterns. This is useful for instance to understand the net
effect of complex catalytic cycles such as the Formose reaction. The
automatically inferred graph grammar rule is a generic representative that also
covers the overall reaction pattern of the Formose cycle, namely two carbonyl
groups that can react with a bound glycolaldehyde to a second glycolaldehyde.
Rule composition also can be used to study polymerization reactions as well as
more complicated iterative reaction schemes. Terpenes and the polyketides, for
instance, form two naturally occurring classes of compounds of utmost
pharmaceutical interest that can be understood as ""generalized polymers""
consisting of five-carbon (isoprene) and two-carbon units, respectively.

metallic atom is gauged by comparing our results obtained using conventional
DFT and DFT+U approaches. The zero bias transport properties may or may not
show spin-filtering behavior, depending on the nature of the d state closest to
the Fermi energy. The type of d state depends on the metallic atom and gives
rise to interference effects that produce different Fano features. The
inclusion of the U term opens a gap between the d states and changes
qualitatively the conductance and spin-filtering behavior in some of the

due to the symmetry-dependent coupling between the d states and other molecular

with flares has been confirmed by many recent studies. These studies showed
that the photospheric magnetic fields respond to coronal field restructuring
and turn to a more horizontal state near the magnetic polarity inversion line
(PIL) after eruptions. Recent theoretical work has shown that the change in the
Lorentz force associated with a magnetic eruption will lead to such a field
configuration at the photosphere. The Helioseismic Magnetic Imager has been
providing unprecedented full-disk vector magnetograms covering the rising phase
of the solar cycle 24. In this study, we analyze 18 flares in four active
regions, with GOES X-ray class ranging from C4.7 to X5.4. We find that there
are permanent and rapid changes of magnetic field around the flaring PIL, the
most notable of which is the increase of the transverse magnetic field. The
changes of fields integrated over the area and the derived change of Lorentz
force both show a strong correlation with flare magnitude. It is the first time
that such magnetic field changes have been observed even for C-class flares.
Furthermore, for seven events with associated CMEs, we use an estimate of the
impulse provided by the Lorentz force, plus the observed CME velocity, to
estimate the CME mass. We find that if the time scale of the back reaction is
short, i.e., in the order of 10 s, the derived values of CME mass (10^{15} g)
generally agree with those reported in literature.

in understanding natural selection under sex, thus providing a rigorous

that the order of magnitude of the bound $\sqrt{2k\log d}$ is tight for $d\leq

gravitational back-reaction will induce possibly a change in the planet's
orbital elements. The accurate determination of the forces acting on the planet
requires careful numerical analysis. Recently, the validity of the often used
fast orbital advection algorithm (FARGO) has been put into question, and
special numerical resolution and stability requirements have been suggested. In
this paper we study the process of planet-disk interaction for small mass
planets of a few Earth masses, and reanalyze the numerical requirements to
obtain converged and stable results. One focus lies on the applicability of the
FARGO-algorithm. Additionally, we study the difference of two and
three-dimensional simulations, compare global with local setups, as well as
isothermal and adiabatic conditions. We study the influence of the planet on
the disk through two- and three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. To
strengthen our conclusions we perform a detailed numerical comparison where
several upwind and Riemann-solver based codes are used with and without the
FARGO-algorithm.
  With respect to the wake structure and the torque density acting on the
planet we demonstrate that the FARGO-algorithm yields correct results, and that
at a fraction of the regular cpu-time. We find that the resolution requirements
for achieving convergent results in unshocked regions are rather modest and
depend on the pressure scale height of the disk. By comparing the torque
densities of 2D and 3D simulations we show that a suitable vertical averaging
procedure for the force gives an excellent agreement between the two. We show

reformulated by Balachandran and Vaidya using the notion of superselection
sectors and direction-dependent test functions at spatial infinity for the
non-local observables. Inspired by these developments and under the assumption
that the spectrum of the electric charge is quantized, (in units of a
fundamental charge e) we construct a family of vertex operators which create
winding number k, electrically charged Abelian vortices from the vacuum (zero
winding number sector) and/or shift the winding number by k units. In
particular, we find that for rotating vortices the vertex operator at level k
shifts the angular momentum of the vortex by k \frac{{\tilde q}}{q}, where
\tilde q is the electric charge of the quantum state of the vortex and q is the
charge of the vortex scalar field under the U(1) gauge field. We also show
that, for charged-particle-vortex composites angular momentum eigenvalues shift
by k \frac{{\tilde q}}{q}, {\tilde q} being the electric charge of the
charged-particle-vortex composite. This leads to the result that for
\frac{{\tilde q}}{q} half-odd integral and for odd k our vertex operators flip
the statistics of charged-particle-vortex composites from bosons to fermions
and vice versa. For fractional values of \frac{{\tilde q}}{q}, application of
vertex operator on charged-particle-vortex composite leads in general to
composites with anyonic statistics.

magnetic materials with decreasing temperature, the so-called spin glass
transition, is relatively better understood (Mezard, Parisi and Virasoro, 1987;
Castellani and Cavagna, 2005). Previously found similarity between some spin
glass models with the structural glasses (Kirkpatrick and Thirumalai, 1987;

Bouchaud, 2012) based on the scenario of spin glass transition. This scenario
though looks very appealing is still far from being well established. One of
the main differences between standard spin systems to molecular systems is the
absence of quenched disorder and the presence of translational invariance: it
often assumed that this difference is not relevant, but this conjecture is
still far from being established. The quantities, which are well defined and
characterized for spin models, are not easily calculable for molecular glasses
due to the lack of quenched disorder which breaks the translational invariance
in the system and the characterization of the similarity between the spin and
the structural glass transition remained an elusive subject still now. In this
study we introduced a model structural glass with built in quenched disorder
which alleviates this main difference between the spin and molecular glasses
thereby helping us to compare these two systems: the possibility of producing a
good thermalization at rather low temperatures is one of the advantages of this
model.

conditional ergodicity of infinite-dimensional Markov chains. Given a Markov
chain in a product space, we aim to understand the ergodic properties of its
conditional distributions given one of the components. Such questions play a
fundamental role in the ergodic theory of nonlinear filters. In the setting of
Harris chains, conditional ergodicity has been established under general
nondegeneracy assumptions. Unfortunately, Markov chains in infinite-dimensional
state spaces are rarely amenable to the classical theory of Harris chains due
to the singularity of their transition probabilities, while topological and
functional methods that have been developed in the ergodic theory of
infinite-dimensional Markov chains are not well suited to the investigation of
conditional distributions. We must therefore develop new measure-theoretic
tools in the ergodic theory of Markov chains that enable the investigation of
conditional ergodicity for infinite dimensional or weak-* ergodic processes. To
this end, we first develop local counterparts of zero-two laws that arise in
the theory of Harris chains. These results give rise to ergodic theorems for
Markov chains that admit asymptotic couplings or that are locally mixing in the
sense of H. F\""{o}llmer, and to a non-Markovian ergodic theorem for stationary
absolutely regular sequences. We proceed to show that local ergodicity is
inherited by conditioning on a nondegenerate observation process. This is used
to prove stability and unique ergodicity of the nonlinear filter. Finally, we
show that our abstract results can be applied to infinite-dimensional Markov
processes that arise in several settings, including dissipative stochastic
partial differential equations, stochastic spin systems and stochastic
differential delay equations.

pathogens, are under continuous pressure to adapt in response to changing
environments. A statistical framework for inference from diversity data of such

of genealogies in a model of continual adaptation in asexual populations. We
show that lineages trace back to a small pool of highly fit ancestors, in which
almost simultaneous coalescence of more than two lineages frequently occurs.
While such multiple mergers are unlikely under the neutral coalescent, they
create a unique genetic footprint in adapting populations. The site frequency
spectrum of derived neutral alleles, for example, is non-monotonic and has a
peak at high frequencies, whereas Tajima's D becomes more and more negative
with increasing sample size. Since multiple merger coalescents emerge in many
models of rapid adaptation, we argue that they should be considered as a
null-model for adapting populations.

that it arises from a small residual negative scalar-curvature present even in
empty spacetime. The vacuum has this residual curvature because spacetime is
fundamentally discrete and there are more ways for a discrete geometry to have
negative curvature than positive. We explicitly compute this effect in the
well-known {\em dynamical triangulations} (DT) model for quantum gravity and
the predicted cosmological constant $\Lambda$ agrees with observation.
  We begin by almost completely characterizing the DT-model's vacuum energies
in dimension three. Remarkably, the energy gap between states comes in
increments of [\Delta\mathcal{A} =\frac{\ell}{8\mathcal{V}}] in natural units,
where $\ell$ is the ""Planck length"" in the model and $\mathcal{V}$ is the
volume of the universe. Then, using only vacua in the $N$ energy levels nearest
zero, where $N$ is the universe's radius in units of $\ell$, we apply our model
to the current co-moving spatial volume to get $|\Lambda| \approx 10^{-123}$.
  This result comes with a rigorous proof and does not depend on any
holographic principle or carefully tuned parameters. Our only unknown is the
relative entropy of the low-energy states, which sets the sign of $\Lambda$.
Numerical evidence strongly suggests that spacetime entropy in the DT-model is
a decreasing function of scalar-curvature, so the model also predicts the
correct sign for $\Lambda$.

spectral information for 140x140 spatial elements over a 1.75 arcsecs x 1.75
arcsecs field of view (FOV). CHARIS will operate in the near infrared (lambda =
0.9 - 2.5 microns) and provide a spectral resolution of R = 14, 33, and 65 in
three separate observing modes. Taking advantage of the adaptive optics systems
and advanced coronagraphs (AO188 and SCExAO) on the Subaru telescope, CHARIS
will provide sufficient contrast to obtain spectra of young self-luminous
Jupiter-mass exoplanets. CHARIS is in the early design phases and is projected
to have first light by the end of 2015. We report here on the current
conceptual design of CHARIS and the design challenges.

Stroke Minimization has proven symmetric dark holes over small bandwidths by
using three wavelengths to define the bandwidth of correction in the
optimization problem. We address the relationship of amplitude and phase
aberrations with wavelength, how this changes with multiple DMs, and the
implications for simultaneously correcting both to achieve symmetric dark
holes. Operating Stroke Minimization in the windowed configuration requires
multiple wavelength estimates. To save on exposures, a single estimate is
extrapolated to bounding wavelengths using the established relationship in
wavelength to produce multiple estimates of the image plane electric field.
Here we demonstrate better performance by improving this extrapolation of the
estimate to other wavelengths. The accuracy of the functional relationship will
ultimately bound the achievable bandwidth, therefore as a metric these results
are also compared to estimating each wavelength separately. In addition to
these algorithm improvements, we also discuss a laboratory upgrade and how it
can better simulate broadband starlight. We also discuss the possibility of
leveraging two DMs in series to directly estimate the electric field over a
narrow bandwidth and the challenges associated with it.

At a generic point on the Higgs branch, the R-symmetry and gauge group are

introducing an electric flux of the Dp-brane worldvolume U(1) gauge field, and

dark matter halos from 0.5<z<6. In the model, black hole (BH) mass is linearly
related to galaxy mass, and galaxies are connected to dark matter halos via
empirically constrained relations. A simple ""scattered"" light bulb model for
quasars is adopted, wherein BHs shine at a fixed fraction of the Eddington
luminosity during accretion episodes, and Eddington ratios are drawn from a
lognormal distribution that is redshift-independent. This model has two free,
physically meaningful parameters at each redshift: the normalization of the
Mbh-Mgal relation and the quasar duty cycle; these parameters are fit to the
observed quasar luminosity function (LF) over the interval 0.5<z<6. This simple
model provides an excellent fit to the LF at all epochs, and also successfully
predicts the observed projected two-point correlation of quasars from
0.5<z<2.5. It is significant that a single quasar duty cycle at each redshift
is capable of reproducing the extant observations. The data are therefore
consistent with a scenario wherein quasars are equally likely to exist in
galaxies, and therefore dark matter halos, over a wide range in masses. The
knee in the quasar LF is a reflection of the knee in the stellar mass-halo mass
relation. Future constraints on the quasar LF and quasar clustering at high
redshift will provide strong constraints on the model. In the model, the
autocorrelation function of quasars becomes a strong function of luminosity
only at the very highest luminosities, and will be difficult to observe because
such quasars are so rare. Cross-correlation techniques may provide useful
constraints on the bias of such rare objects.

amplified small density fluctuations generated shortly after the Big Bang,

led to a growing demand for methods to analyze time-dependent particle based
simulations. Rendering methods for such N-body simulation data usually employ
some kind of splatting approach via point based rendering primitives and
approximate the spatial distributions of physical quantities using kernel

to generate a tetrahedral tessellation of the computational domain, with mesh
vertices defined by the simulation's dark matter particle positions. Over time
the mesh is deformed by gravitational forces, causing the tetrahedral cells to
warp and overlap. The new methods are well suited to visualize the cosmic web.
In particular they preserve caustics, regions of high density that emerge, when
several streams of dark matter particles share the same location in space,
indicating the formation of structures like sheets, filaments and halos. We

characterize the throughput behavior of classical TCP and TCP/NC as a function
of erasure probability, round-trip time, maximum window size, and duration of

erasures from TCP, thus preventing TCP's performance degradation in lossy

TCP.
  In addition, we show that TCP/NC may lead to cost reduction for wireless
network providers while maintaining a certain quality of service to their
users. We measure the cost in terms of number of base stations, which is highly
correlated to the energy, capital, and operational costs of a network provider.
We show that increasing the available bandwidth may not necessarily lead to
increase in throughput, particularly in lossy networks in which TCP does not
perform well. We show that using protocols such as TCP/NC, which are more
resilient to erasures, may lead to a throughput commensurate the bandwidth

X, at each time n a decision u_n is made as a function of past observations
X_0,...,X_{n-1}, and a loss l(u_n,X_n) is incurred. In this setting, it is
known that one may choose (under a mild integrability assumption) a decision
strategy whose pathwise time-average loss is asymptotically smaller than that
of any other strategy. The corresponding problem in the case of partial
information proves to be much more delicate, however: if the process X is not
observable, but decisions must be based on the observation of a different
process Y, the existence of pathwise optimal strategies is not guaranteed.
  The aim of this paper is to exhibit connections between pathwise optimal
strategies and notions from ergodic theory. The sequential decision problem is
developed in the general setting of an ergodic dynamical system (\Omega,B,P,T)
with partial information Y\subseteq B. The existence of pathwise optimal
strategies grounded in two basic properties: the conditional ergodic theory of
the dynamical system, and the complexity of the loss function. When the loss
function is not too complex, a general sufficient condition for the existence
of pathwise optimal strategies is that the dynamical system is a conditional
K-automorphism relative to the past observations \bigvee_n T^n Y. If the
conditional ergodicity assumption is strengthened, the complexity assumption
can be weakened. Several examples demonstrate the interplay between complexity
and ergodicity, which does not arise in the case of full information. Our
results also yield a decision-theoretic characterization of weak mixing in
ergodic theory, and establish pathwise optimality of ergodic nonlinear filters.

The same framework is also used to construct a more realistic theory in which

extension gives corrections to the the nucleation rate even for the case of

diversification is commonly inferred from molecular phylogenies. This pattern
is consistent with some verbal theory of ecological opportunity and adaptive
radiations. One often-overlooked source of bias in these studies is that of
sampling at the level of whole clades, as researchers tend to choose large,
speciose clades to study. In this paper, we investigate the performance of
common methods across the distribution of clade sizes that can be generated by
a constant-rate birth-death process. Clades which are larger than expected for
a given constant-rate branching process tend to show a pattern of an early
burst even when both speciation and extinction rates are constant through time.
All methods evaluated were susceptible to detecting this false signature when
extinction was low. Under moderate extinction, both the gamma-statistic and
diversity-dependent models did not detect such a slowdown but only because the
signature of a slowdown was masked by subsequent extinction. Some models which
estimate time-varying speciation rates are able to detect early bursts under
higher extinction rates, but are extremely prone to sampling bias. We suggest
that examining clades in isolation may result in spurious inferences that rates
of diversification have changed through time.

speed up the sampling of the rare events by biasing the equilibrium
distribution towards a distribution under which the rare events is no longer

$|S^2| \ge 3|S|-2$. On the road to this goal, we also prove a number of

transmitting messages over finite-state erasure channels with memory.
Information bits are protected from channel erasures using error-correcting
codes; successful receptions of codewords are acknowledged at the source
through instantaneous feedback. The primary focus of this research is on
delay-sensitive applications, codes with finite block lengths and, necessarily,
non-vanishing probabilities of decoding failure. The contribution of this
article is twofold. A methodology to compute the distribution of the time
required to empty a buffer is introduced. Based on this distribution, the mean
hitting time to an empty queue and delay-violation probabilities for specific
thresholds can be computed explicitly. The proposed techniques apply to
situations where the transmit buffer contains a predetermined number of
information bits at the onset of the data transfer. Furthermore, as additional
performance criteria, large deviation principles are obtained for the empirical
mean service time and the average packet-transmission time associated with the
communication process. This rigorous framework yields a pragmatic methodology
to select code rate and block length for the communication unit as functions of
the service requirements. Examples motivated by practical systems are provided
to further illustrate the applicability of these techniques.

quasi-Gaussian beam is an exact solution of the source free Helmholtz wave

In the absence of the electron-electron interaction, the main contribution to

temperature as $T^{-\eta}, $ where $\eta$ is the critical exponent (equal to
$\approx 0.7$ according to numerical studies) describing renormalization of the
flexural phonon correlation functions due to anharmonic coupling with the
in-plane phonons. The electron-electron interaction induces an additional
scattering mechanism and also affects the electron-phonon scattering by
screening the deformation potential. We demonstrate that the combined effect of
both interactions results in a conductivity that can be expressed as a
dimensionless function of two temperature-dependent dimensionless constants,
$G[T]$ and $G_e[T]$ which characterize the strength of electron-phonon and
electron-electron interaction, respectively. We also discuss the behavior of

regularities of evolution dynamics, evaluated by an entropy functional (EF) of
a random field (modeled by a diffusion information process) and an
informational path functional (IPF) on trajectories of the related dynamic
process (Lerner 2012). The integral information measure on the process'
trajectories accumulates and encodes inner connections and dependencies between
the information states, and contains more information than a sum of Shannon's
entropies, which measures and encodes each process's states separately. Cutting
off the process' measured information under action of impulse controls (Lerner
2012a), extracts and reveals hidden information, covering the states'
correlations in a multi-dimensional random process, and implements the EF-IPF
minimax variation principle (VP). The approach models an information observer
(Lerner 2012b)-as an extractor of such information, which is able to convert
the collected information of the random process in the information dynamic
process and organize it in the hierarchical information network (IN), Part2
(Lerner, 2012c). The IN's highest level of the structural hierarchy, measured
by a maximal quantity and quality of the accumulated cooperative information,
evaluates the observer's intelligence level, associated with its ability to
recognize and build such structure of a meaningful hidden information. The
considered evolution of optimal extraction, assembling, cooperation, and
organization of this information in the IN, satisfying the VP, creates the
phenomena of an evolving observer's intelligence. The requirements of
preserving the evolutionary hierarchy impose the restrictions that limit the
observer's intelligence level in the IN. The cooperative information geometry,
evolving under observations, limits the size and volumes of a particular
observer.

strength. Two types of domain wall structures (phases of the wall) exist
depending on the wall orientation. The low-energy 'achiral' phase occurs in the
vicinity of the {110} wall orientation and has odd polarization profile
invariant with respect to inversion about the wall center. The second 'chiral'
phase occurs around {211} wall orientations and corresponds to mixed parity
domain walls that may be of left-handed or right-handed chirality. The
transformation between the phases is abrupt, accompanied with 20-30% change of
the domain wall thickness and can happen at fixed wall orientation with
temperature change. We suggest that the phase transition may be detected
through domain wall thickness change or by c-AFM. The structure of the domain
wall is correlated to its conductivity through polarization component normal to
the domain wall, which causes free carriers accumulation. Depending on the
temperature and flexoelectric coupling strength relative conductivity of the
wall becomes at least one order of magnitude higher than in the single-domain
region, creating c-AFM contrast enhancement pronounced and detectable.

galaxies with Hubble types SBb (pec) and S0/a (pec), respectively. Both
galaxies have L > L*, and they are inferred to each contain a ~2.5x10^8 M_sun
black hole. Mrk 266 SW is likely the primary source of a bright Fe K-alpha line
detected from the system, consistent with the reflection-dominated X-ray
spectrum of a heavily obscured AGN. Optical knots embedded in an arc with
aligned radio continuum radiation, combined with luminous H_2 line emission,
provide evidence for a radiative bow shock in an AGN-driven outflow surrounding
the NE nucleus. Soft X-ray emission modeled as shock-heated plasma is
co-spatial with radio continuum emission between the galaxies. Mid-IR
diagnostics indicate roughly equal contributions of AGN and starburst radiation
powering the bolometric luminosity. Approximately 120 star clusters have been
detected, with most having estimated ages < 50 Myr. Detection of 24 micron
emission extending ~34 arcsec (20 kpc) north of the galaxies is interpreted as
~2x10^7 M_sun of dust entrained in an outflowing superwind; at optical
wavelengths this region is resolved into a fragmented morphology indicative of
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in an expanding shell of ionized gas. Mrk 266
demonstrates that the dust ""blow-out"" phase can begin in a LIRG well before the
galaxies fully coalesce during a subsequent ULIRG phase, and rapid gas
consumption in luminous dual AGNs (kpc scale separations) early in the merger
process may explain the paucity of detected binary QSOs (sub-pc scale orbits)
in large surveys. An evolutionary sequence is proposed representing a
progression from dual to binary AGNs, accompanied by an increase in observed
L_x/L_ir ratios by 10^4 or more.

propose a new consensus scheme, termed hierarchical averaging, and show that it

of social interactions, this includes family, friends, and other strong social
ties. The model proposed in this contribution, embodies a global influence as
well where, by global, we mean that each node also observes a sample of the
average behavior of the entire population (in the social example, people
observe other people on the streets, subway, and other social venues). We
consider a case where nodes have dichotomous states (examples include elections
with two major parties, whether or not to adopt a new technology or product,
and any yes/no opinion such as in voting on a referendum). The dynamics of
states on a network with arbitrary degree distribution are studied. For a given
initial condition, we find the probability to reach consensus on each state and
the expected time reach to consensus. The effect of an exogenous bias on the
average orientation of the system is investigated, to model mass media. To do
so, we add an external field to the model that favors one of the states over
the other. This field interferes with the regular decision process of each node
and creates a constant probability to lean towards one of the states. We solve
for the average state of the system as a function of time for given initial
conditions. Then anti-conformists (stubborn nodes who never revise their
states) are added to the network, in an effort to circumvent the external bias.
We find necessary conditions on the number of these defiant nodes required to
cancel the effect of the external bias. Our analysis is based on a mean field
approximation of the agent opinions.

of these stars we have prepared FITS files comprised of paris of merged spectra
for user access via the Multi-Mission Archives at Space Telescope. We chose
spectra from the first population with spectral types O4, O5, O6, O7, O8, and
O9.5 and used them to compile tables and figures with identifications of all
possible atmospheric and ISM lines in the region 949-1188A. Our identified line

numbers in parentheses are the totals of lines formed in the atmospheres,
according to spectral synthesis models. The total number of unique atmospheric
identifications for the six main sequence O star template spectra is 1792,
whereas the number of atmospheric lines in common to these spectra is 300. The
number of identified lines decreases toward earlier types (increasing effective
temperature), the whlle percentages of ""missed"" features (lines not predicted
from our spectral syntheses) drops from a high of 8% at type B0.2, from our
recently published B star far-UV atlas, to 1--3% for type O spectra. The
percentages of overpredicted lines are similar, despite their being much higher
for B star spectra. We also discuss the statistics of line populations among
the various elemental ionization states. Finally, as an aid to users we list
those isolated lines that can be used to determine stellar temperatures and the
presence of possible chemical anomalies.

  Preamble and Estimator Design","submitted for possible publication",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation for a
two-way relaying system based on the amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol. Our
contributions are in designing an optimal preamble, and the corresponding
estimator, to closely achieve the minimum Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for the CFO.
This optimality is asserted with respect to the novel class of preambles,
referred to as the block-rotated preambles (BRPs). This class includes the
periodic preamble that is used widely in practice, yet it provides an
additional degree of design freedom via a block rotation angle. We first
identify the catastrophic scenario of an arbitrarily large CRB when a
conventional periodic preamble is used. We next resolve this problem by using a
BRP with a non-zero block rotation angle. This angle creates, in effect, an
artificial frequency offset that separates the desired relayed signal from the
self-interference that is introduced in the AF protocol. With appropriate
optimization, the CRB incurs only marginal loss from one-way relaying under
practical channel conditions. To facilitate implementation, a specific
low-complexity class of estimators is examined, and conditions for the
estimators to achieve the optimized CRB is established. Numerical results are
given which corroborate with theoretical findings.

These properties are calculated here for three different crustal compositions
for a non-accreting neutron star that results from three different cooling
histories, as well as for a pure iron crust. A simple shear is simulated using
molecular dynamics to the crustal compositions by deforming the simulation box.
The breaking strain and shear modulus are found to be similar in the four
cases, with a breaking strain of ~0.1 and a shear modulus of ~10^{30} dyne
cm^{-2} at a density of \rho = 10^{14} g cm^{-3} for simulations with an
initially perfect BCC lattice. With these crustal properties and the observed
properties of {PSR J2124-3358} the predicted strain amplitude of gravitational
waves for a maximally deformed crust is found to be greater than the
observational upper limits from LIGO. This suggests that the neutron star crust
in this case may not be maximally deformed or it may not have a perfect BCC
lattice structure. The implications of the calculated crustal properties of
bursts from SGRs are also explored. The mechanical properties found for a
perfect BCC lattice structure find that crustal events alone can not be ruled

parameter (q_{ion}=2.5^{+1.7}_{-0.8}x10^8 cm s^{-1}) and a low oxygen abundance
(12+log(O/H)=7.84^{+0.24}_{-0.25}) in contrast with moderate values of other

LAEs appear to fall below the mass-metallicity relation of z~2 LBGs. Similarly,
a low metallicity of 12+log(O/H)<8.4 is independently indicated for typical
LAEs from a composite spectrum and the [NII]/Ha index. Such high ionization

would represent an early stage of galaxy formation dominated by massive stars

ionizing photons efficiently with a high escape fraction achieved by
density-bounded HII regions, which would significantly contribute to cosmic

is an invariant whose magnitude $|R|$ is a measure of the size of mesoscopic
organized structures in a fluid, and whose sign specifies whether
intermolecular interactions are effectively attractive ($R<0$) or repulsive
($R>0$). I discuss five principles for $R$ in pure fluids: 1) near the critical

$|R|$ proportional to the correlation volume $\xi^3$, and sign of $R$ negative,

by the repulsive part of the interactions, and sign of $R$ positive, 3) in the
asymptotic critical point regime, the $R$'s in the coexisting liquid and vapor
phases are equal to each other, i.e., commensurate, 4) outside the asymptotic
critical point regime incommensurate $R$'s may be associated with
metastability, and 5) the compact liquid phase has $|R|$ on the order of the

sets that achieve optimal order QMC error bounds (as is the case for efficient
spherical designs), we are led to introduce the concept of QMC designs: these
are sequences of $N$-point node sets $X_N$ on $S^d$ such that the worst-case
error of the corresponding QMC rules satisfy a bound of order $O(N^{-s/d})$ as
$N\to\infty$ with an implied constant that depends on the $H^s(S^d)$-norm.

consequence of a recent result of Bondarenko et al. on the existence of
spherical designs with appropriate number of points, we show that minimizers of
the $N$-point energy for the reproducing kernel for $H^s(S^d)$, $s>d/2$, form a
sequence of QMC designs for $H^s(S^d)$. Furthermore, without appealing to the
Bondarenko et al. result, we prove that point sets that maximize the sum of
suitable powers of the Euclidean distance between pairs of points form a
sequence of QMC designs for $H^s(S^d)$ with $s\in(d/2,d/2+1)$.
  Numerical experiments suggest that many familiar sequences of point sets on
the sphere (equal area, spiral, minimal [Coulomb or log.] energy, and Fekete
points) are QMC designs for appropriate values of $s$. For comparison purposes
we show that sets of random points that are independently and uniformly
distributed on the sphere do not constitute QMC designs for any $s>d/2$.
  If $(X_N)$ is a sequence of QMC designs for $H^s(S^d)$, we prove that it is
also a sequence of QMC designs for $\mathbb{H}^{s'}(S^d)$ for all
$s'\in(d/2,s)$. This leads to the question of determining the supremum of such
$s$, for which we provide estimates based on computations for the

population transfer to the final deeply bound state in the presence of
decoherence. We also analyze the inherent phase relation that takes place owing
to collisional dephasing between molecules in each of the states. This ability
to control the rovibrational states of a molecule with an optical frequency
comb enables us to create a deeply bound ultracold polar molecules from the
Feshbach state.

how gravitational light bending affects the corona--disk interaction.

relativistically--convolved reflection components in our spectral analysis
indicate that: (1) the disk inner radius remains constant at \rin$=1.65\pm0.08

reddening-corrected distance to the LMC of 18.477 +/- 0.033 (systematic) mag.
We re-examine the systematic uncertainties in H0, also taking into account new
data over the past decade. In combination with the new Spitzer calibration, the
systematic uncertainty in H0 over that obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) Key Project has decreased by over a factor of three. Applying the Spitzer
calibration to the Key Project sample, we find a value of H0 = 74.3 with a

systematic uncertainty in the Hubble constant. This result, in combination with
WMAP7 measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies and assuming
a flat universe, yields a value of the equation of state for dark energy, w0 =
-1.09 +/- 0.10. Alternatively, relaxing the constraints on flatness and the

Type Ia supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations yields w0 = -1.08 +/- 0.10

realistic model of inflexibility. The first one is the Galam Unifying Frame
(GUF), which incorporates rational and inflexible agents, and the other one
considers the combination of Continuous Opinions and Discrete Actions (CODA).
While initially in GUF, inflexibility is a fixed given feature of an agent, it
is now the result of an accumulation for a given agent who makes the same
choice through repeated updates. Inflexibility thus emerges as an internal
property of agents becoming a continuous function of the strength of its
opinion. Therefore an agent can be more or less inflexible and can shift from
inflexibility along one choice to inflexibility along the opposite choice.
These individual dynamics of the building up and falling off of an agent
inflexibility are driven by the successive local updates of the associated
individual opinions. New results are obtained and discussed in terms of
predicting outcomes of public debates.

  measurements are costly?",,,,,"math.OC cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A decision maker records measurements of a finite-state Markov chain
corrupted by noise. The goal is to decide when the Markov chain hits a specific
target state. The decision maker can choose from a finite set of sampling
intervals to pick the next time to look at the Markov chain. The aim is to
optimize an objective comprising of false alarm, delay cost and cumulative
measurement sampling cost. Taking more frequent measurements yields accurate
estimates but incurs a higher measurement cost. Making an erroneous decision
too soon incurs a false alarm penalty. Waiting too long to declare the target
state incurs a delay penalty. What is the optimal sequential strategy for the
decision maker? The paper shows that under reasonable conditions, the optimal
strategy has the following intuitive structure: when the Bayesian estimate
(posterior distribution) of the Markov chain is away from the target state,
look less frequently; while if the posterior is close to the target state, look
more frequently. Bounds are derived for the optimal strategy. Also the
achievable optimal cost of the sequential detector as a function of transition
dynamics and observation distribution is analyzed. The sensitivity of the
optimal achievable cost to parameter variations is bounded in terms of the
Kullback divergence. To prove the results in this paper, novel stochastic
dominance results on the Bayesian filtering recursion are derived. The
formulation in this paper generalizes quickest time change detection to
consider optimal sampling and also yields useful results in sensor scheduling
(active sensing).

properties that an inferential procedure should have for exploratory analysis:
the procedure should be mild, flexible and post hoc. Their inferential
procedure gives a lower bound on the number of false hypotheses among the
selected hypotheses, and moreover whenever possible identifies elementary
hypotheses that are false. The need to estimate a lower bound on the number of
false hypotheses arises in various applications, and the partial conjunction
approach was developed for this purpose in Biometrics 64 (2008) 1215-1222 (see
also Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. A 367 (2009) 4255-4271 for more

the same problem, it is of interest to give a lower bound on the number of
studies in which the finding was reproduced. I will first address the relation
between the method of Goeman and Solari and the partial conjunction approach.
Then I will discuss possible extensions and address the issue of exploration in

derived by solving three independent components of the bulk Einstein equation,

satisfied, as far as the five on-brane functions obey three essential
equations. They are the radial-extra and the extra-extra components of the bulk
Einstein equation on the brane, and the equation of motion of the brane.

based on 39 individual galaxies and 8 clusters that have been the sites of well

competing scenarios that are proposed to explain the broad Fe K{\alpha} line in
the Seyfert 1 galaxy MCG-6-30-15. The polarisation signature of complex
absorption is studied for a partial covering scenario using a clumpy wind and
compared to a reflection model based on the lamp-post geometry. The shape of
the polarisation percentage and angle as a function of photon energy are found
to be distinctly different between the reflection and the absorption case.
Relativistic reflection produces significantly stronger polarisation in the
1-10 keV energy band than absorption. The spectrum of the polarisation angle
adds additional constraints: in the absorption case it shows a constant shape,
whereas the relativistic reflection scenario typically leads to a smooth
rotation of the polarisation angle with photon energy. Based on this work, we
conclude that a soft X-ray polarimeter on-board a small X-ray satellite may
already discriminate between the absorption and the reflection scenario. A
promising opportunity may arise with the X-ray Imaging Polarimetry Explorer
(XIPE) mission, which has been proposed to ESA in response to a small-size

the manner of presentation was varied. Therefore one condition was

bulk 3+1 dimensional spacetime. The horizon is endowed with area by lines of
gravitational flux which pierce the surface. As is well known, counting of the
possible states associated with a given set of punctures allows us to recover
the famous Bekenstein-Hawking area law according to which the entropy of a
black hole is proportional to the area of the associated horizon $ S_{BH}
\propto A_{Hor} $. It is also known that the dynamics of the horizon degrees of
freedom is described by the Chern-Simons action of a $\mathfrak{su(2)}$ (or
$\mathfrak{u(1)}$ after a certain gauge fixing) valued gauge field $A_{\mu}^i$.
Recent numerical work which performs the state-counting for punctures, from
first-principles, reveals a step-like structure in the entropy-area relation.
We argue that both the presence of the Chern-Simons action and the step-like
structure in the entropy-area curve are indicative of the fact that the
effective theory which describes the dynamics of punctures on the horizon is
that of the Quantum Hall Effect.

fermionic and bosonic models for disordered superconductors that one can
identify a universal rescaling of the OPD. By performing scanning-tunneling
microscopy experiments in three samples of NbN with increasing disorder we show
that such a rescaling describes also with an excellent accuracy the
experimental data. These results can provide a breakthrough in our

studies whether they can be deployed as an incremental practice that brings
additional benefits without being unacceptably expensive. We introduce a
methodology that extends Design by Contract to write strong specifications of
functional properties in the form of preconditions, postconditions, and
invariants. The methodology aims at being palatable to developers who are not
fluent in formal techniques but are comfortable with writing simple
specifications. We evaluate the cost and the benefits of using strong
specifications by applying the methodology to testing data structure
implementations written in Eiffel and C#. In our extensive experiments, testing
against strong specifications detects twice as many bugs as standard contracts,
with a reasonable overhead in terms of annotation burden and run-time
performance while testing. In the wide spectrum of formal techniques for
software quality, testing against strong specifications lies in a ""sweet spot""
with a favorable benefit to effort ratio.

In classical physics, the minimal coupling in electromagnetism and to the
action for a mechanical system in Hamiltonian form are examples of CS
functionals. CS forms are also the natural generalization of the minimal
coupling between the electromagnetic field and a point charge when the source
is not point-like but an extended fundamental object, a membrane. They are
found in relation with anomalies in quantum field theories, and as Lagrangians

results from LHCb have made a significant impact on the flavour physics
landscape and have definitively proved the concept of a dedicated experiment in
the forward region at a hadron collider. This document discusses the
implications of these first measurements on classes of extensions to the
Standard Model, bearing in mind the interplay with the results of searches for
on-shell production of new particles at ATLAS and CMS. The physics potential of
an upgrade to the LHCb detector, which would allow an order of magnitude more

hexagonal intrinsic graphite was calculated within the self-consistent-field
approximation. The plasmon frequency \omega_p is determined as functions of the
transferred momentum $q_{\parallel}$ along the hexagonal plane in the Brillouin
zone and its perpendicular component $q_z$. These plasmons are isotropic within
the plane in the long wavelength limit. As the in-plane transferred momentum is
increased, the plasmon frequency strongly depends on its magnitude and
direction (\phi). With increasing angle, the dispersion relation within the
hexagonal plane is gradually changed from quadratic to nearly linear form.
There are many significant differences for the \pi-plasmon dispersion relations
between 2D graphene and 3D AA-stacked graphite. They include $q_\parallel$- and
\phi-dependence and \pi-plasmon bandwidth. This result reveals that interlayer
interaction could enhance anisotropy of in-plane \pi-plasmons. For chosen
$\textbf{q}_\parallel$, we also obtain the plasmon frequency as a function of
$q_z$ and show that there is an upper bound on $q_z$ for plasmons to exist in
graphite. Additionally, the group velocity for plasmon propagation along the
perpendicular direction may be positive or negative depending on the choice of
$\textbf{q}_\parallel$. Consequently, the forward and backward propagation of
\pi-plasmons in AA-stacked graphite in which the energy flow is respectively
parallel or antiparallel to the transferred momentum, can be realized. The
backward flowing resonance is an intrinsic property of AA-stacked graphite,
arising from the energy band structure and the interlayer coupling.

$S_t:=\displaystyle\sum_{n=0}^t X_n$, where $(X_n)$ are i.i.d. When the
increments $(X_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ are a one-order Markov chain, a short
memory is introduced in the dynamics of $(S_t)$. This so-called ""persistent""
random walk is nolonger Markovian and, under suitable conditions, the rescaled
process converges towards the integrated telegraph noise (ITN) as the
time-scale and space-scale parameters tend to zero (see Herrmann and Vallois,
2010; Tapiero-Vallois, Tapiero-Vallois2}). The ITN process is effectively
non-Markovian too. The aim is to consider persistent random walks $(S_t)$ whose
increments are Markov chains with variable order which can be infinite. This
variable memory is enlighted by a one-to-one correspondence between $(X_n)$ and
a suitable Variable Length Markov Chain (VLMC), since for a VLMC the dependency
from the past can be unbounded.
  The key fact is to consider the non Markovian letter process $(X_n)$ as the
margin of a couple $(X_n,M_n)_{n\ge 0}$ where $(M_n)_{n\ge 0}$ stands for the
memory of the process $(X_n)$. We prove that, under a suitable rescaling,
$(S_n,X_n,M_n)$ converges in distribution towards a time continuous process
$(S^0(t),X(t),M(t))$. The process $(S^0(t))$ is a semi-Markov and Piecewise
Deterministic Markov Process whose paths are piecewise linear.

substellar objects either directly by their effect on the formation of spectral
lines, or through the activity phenomena they power which can be observed
across a large part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Stars show a very wide
variety of magnetic properties in terms of strength, geometry or variability.
Cool stars generate their magnetic fields by dynamo effect, and their
properties appear to correlate - to some extent - with stellar parameters such
as mass, rotation and age. With the improvements of instrumentation and data
analysis techniques, magnetic fields can now be detected and studied down to
the domain of very-low-mass stars and brown dwarfs, triggering new theoretical
works aimed, in particular, at modelling dynamo action in these objects. After
a brief discussion on the importance of magnetic field in stellar physics, the
basics of dynamo theory and magnetic field measurements are presented. The main
results stemming from observational and theoretical studies of magnetism are
then detailed in two parts: the fully-convective transition, and the very-low
mass stars and brown dwarfs domain.

$p$-adic Potts model over the Cayley tree of order three. We consider a more
general notion of $p$-adic Gibbs measure which depends on parameter
$\rho\in\bq_p$. Such a measure is called {\it generalized $p$-adic quasi Gibbs
measure}. When $\rho$ equals to $p$-adic exponent, then it coincides with the
$p$-adic Gibbs measure. When $\rho=p$, then it coincides with $p$-adic quasi
Gibbs measure. Therefore, we investigate two regimes with respect to the value
of $|\rho|_p$. Namely, in the first regime, one takes $\rho=\exp_p(J)$ for some
$J\in\bq_p$, in the second one $|\rho|_p<1$. In each regime, we first find
conditions for the existence of generalized $p$-adic quasi Gibbs measures.
Furthermore, in the first regime, we establish the existence of the phase
transition under some conditions. In the second regime, when $|\r|_p,|q|_p\leq
p^{-2}$ we prove the existence of a quasi phase transition. It turns out that
if $|\r|_p<|q-1|_p^2<1$ and $\sqrt{-3}\in\bq_p$, then one finds the existence

selected via their Sunyaev--Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. We use 13 galaxy clusters
uniformly selected from 178 deg^2 observed with the South Pole Telescope (SPT)
and followed up by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. They form an approximately
mass-limited sample (> 3 x 10^14 M_sun h^-1_70) spanning redshifts 0.3 < z <
1.1. Using previously published X-ray-selected cluster samples, we compare two
proxies of cool-core strength: surface brightness concentration (cSB) and
cuspiness ({\alpha}). We find that cSB is better constrained. We measure cSB
for the SPT sample and find several new z > 0.5 cool-core clusters, including
two strong cool cores. This rules out the hypothesis that there are no z > 0.5
clusters that qualify as strong cool cores at the 5.4{\sigma} level. The
fraction of strong cool-core clusters in the SPT sample in this redshift regime
is between 7% and 56% (95% confidence). Although the SPT selection function is
significantly different from the X-ray samples, the high-z cSB distribution for
the SPT sample is statistically consistent with that of X-ray-selected samples
at both low and high redshifts. The cool-core strength is inversely correlated
with the offset between the brightest cluster galaxy and the X-ray centroid,
providing evidence that the dynamical state affects the cool-core strength of
the cluster. Larger SZ-selected samples will be crucial in understanding the
evolution of cluster cool cores over cosmic time.

In this paper we begin the important task of deriving the cosmology associated

we are able to obtain a number of fixed points for the system, with some
remarkable new solutions emerging from the trade-off between the various
potentials. As well as obtaining inflationary solutions we also find
conventional radiation/matter-like solutions, but in regimes where the energy
density is dominated by a cosmological constant, and where we do not have any
explicit forms of radiation or matter. Stability conditions for matter
solutions are obtained and we show how it is possible for there to exist an
extended period of `matter domination' opening up the possibility that we can
generate cosmological structures, and recover a consistent cosmology even in
the presence of a large cosmological constant.

study of the combined radio-optical data by investigating if there is a
correlation between the radio luminosity at 20 cm over the luminosity of the
optical H\alpha line (L[20 cm]/L[H\alpha]) and line excitation ratios, where
the latter provide the spectroscopic classification in Seyferts, low-ionization
nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs) and star-forming galaxies. We found that
the percentage of detected AGNs (Seyferts and LINERs) or composites is much
higher in the optical-radio sample than in the optical sample alone. There is a
progressive shift of the sources towards the AGN region of the diagram with
increasing L[20 cm]/L[H\alpha], with an indication for a different behavior for
LINERs and Seyferts. The classification appears to slightly depend on the
redshift. A comparison with photoionization and shock models shows that the
large fraction of LINERs identified in our study have emission lines that may
be explained by shocks. The [NII]/H\alpha vs. equivalent width of the H\alpha
line (WHAN) diagram confirms the LINER classification for most of those that
have been identified with the traditional diagnostic diagrams. The correlation
between L[20 cm]/L[H\alpha] and optical emission line ratios suggests the
nuclear origin of the emission from the most powerful radio-galaxies.

patterns of genetic variation within a population. Most analyses of these
distortions focus on the signatures of hitchhiking due to hard or soft
selective sweeps at a single genetic locus. However, in linked regions of
rapidly adapting genomes, multiple beneficial mutations at different loci can
segregate simultaneously within the population, an effect known as clonal
interference. This leads to a subtle interplay between hitchhiking and
interference effects, which leads to a unique signature of rapid adaptation on
genetic variation both at the selected sites and at linked neutral loci. Here,
we introduce an effective coalescent theory (a ""fitness-class coalescent"") that
describes how positive selection at many perfectly linked sites alters the
structure of genealogies. We use this theory to calculate several simple
statistics describing genetic variation within a rapidly adapting population,
and to implement efficient backwards-time coalescent simulations which can be

over a common random network is considered. The model can represent the
spreading of true and false information over a communication network, the
propagation of faults in a large-scale control system, or the development of
trust and mistrust in a society. At each time instance and with a given
probability, a pair of network nodes are selected to interact. At random each
of the nodes then updates its state towards the state of the other node
(attraction), away from the other node (repulsion), or sticks to its current
state (neglect). Agreement convergence and disagreement divergence results are
obtained for various strengths of the updates for both symmetric and asymmetric
update rules. Impossibility theorems show that a specific level of attraction
is required for almost sure asymptotic agreement and a specific level of
repulsion is required for almost sure asymptotic disagreement. A series of
sufficient and/or necessary conditions are then established for agreement
convergence or disagreement divergence. In particular, under symmetric updates,
a critical convergence measure in the attraction and repulsion update strength
is found, in the sense that the asymptotic property of the network state
evolution transits from agreement convergence to disagreement divergence when
this measure goes from negative to positive. The result can be interpreted as a
tight bound on how much bad action needs to be injected in a dynamic network in
order to consistently steer its overall behavior away from consensus.

owes its origin to the sensory organ like response of the nanoribbons,
demonstrating that considerations beyond the usual Stoner-Landau theory are
necessary to understand the magnetism of these systems. A first order magnetic
transition from an anti-parallel orientation of the moments on opposite edges
to a parallel orientation occurs upon doping with holes or electrons. The
critical doping for this transition is shown to depend inversely on the width
of the ribbon. Using variational Monte-Carlo calculations, we show that
magnetism is robust to fluctuations. Additionally, we show that the magnetic

nanodots. Furthermore, we perform first principles modeling to show how such

mod- eling the strong nuclear force, which is responsible for the interactions
of nuclear particles. Lattice QCD (LQCD) is the corresponding discrete
formulation, widely used for simula- tions. The computational demand for the
LQCD is tremendous. It has played a role in the history of supercomputers, and
has also helped defining their future. Designing efficient LQCD codes that
scale well on large (probably hybrid) supercomputers requires to express many
levels of parallelism, and then to explore different algorithmic solutions.
While al- gorithmic exploration is the key for efficient parallel codes, the
process is hampered by the necessary coding effort. We present in this paper a
domain-specific language, QIRAL, for a high level expression of parallel
algorithms in LQCD. Parallelism is expressed through the mathematical struc-
ture of the sparse matrices defining the problem. We show that from these
expressions and from algorithmic and preconditioning formulations, a parallel
code can be automatically generated. This separates algorithms and mathematical
formulations for LQCD (that be- long to the field of physics) from the
effective orchestration of parallelism, mainly related to compilation and
optimization for parallel architectures.

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) cosmology with an eye to the issue of time
problem in quantum cosmology. We introduce a canonical transformation on the
scalar field sector of the action such that the momentum conjugate to the new
canonical variable appears linearly in the transformed Hamiltonian. Using this
canonical transformation, we show that, it may lead to the identification of a
time parameter for the corresponding dynamical system. In the cases of flat,
closed and open FRW universes the classical cosmological solutions are obtained
in terms of the introduced time parameter. Moreover, this formalism gives rise
to a Schr\""{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the quantum-mechanical
description of the model under consideration, the eigenfunctions of which can
be used to construct the wave function of the universe. We use the resulting
wave functions in order to investigate the possible corrections to the
classical cosmologies due to quantum effects by means of the many-worlds and
ontological interpretation of quantum cosmology.

important task in the automated marble plate production. Nowadays some
inspection systems in marble industry that automate the classification tasks
are too expensive and are compatible only with specific technological equipment
in the plant. In this paper a new approach to the design of an Automated Marble
Plate Classification System (AMPCS),based on different neural network input
training sets is proposed, aiming at high classification accuracy using simple
processing and application of only standard devices. It is based on training a
classification MLP neural network with three different input training sets:
extracted texture histograms, Discrete Cosine and Wavelet Transform over the
histograms. The algorithm is implemented in a PLC for real-time operation. The
performance of the system is assessed with each one of the input training sets.
The experimental test results regarding classification accuracy and quick
operation are represented and discussed.
