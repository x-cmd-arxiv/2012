well as ideal molecular-beam epitaxy models, are prototypes to study the
symmetries of conserved dynamics. In this work we study two similar VCS models
with conserved noise, which differ from each other by the axial symmetry of
their dynamic hopping rules. We use a coarse-grained approach to analyze the
models and show how to determine the coefficients of their corresponding
continuous stochastic differential equation (SDE) within the same universality
class. The employed method makes use of small translations in a test space
which contains the stationary probability density function (SPDF). In case of
the symmetric model we calculate all the coarse-grained coefficients of the
related conserved Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. With respect to the
symmetric model, the asymmetric model adds new terms which have to be analyzed,
first of all the diffusion term, whose coarse-grained coefficient can be
determined by the same method. In contrast to other methods, the used formalism
allows to calculate all coefficients of the SDE theoretically and within limits
numerically. Above all, the used approach connects the coefficients of the SDE
with the SPDF and hence gives them a precise physical meaning.

molecules that undergo truly one-dimensional translational diffusion (e.g. a

second dimension corresponding to a rotational or conformational degree of

show that the reaction rate law exhibits a crossover from one-dimensional to
two-dimensional diffusion as a function of particle concentration and the size
of the smaller dimension. In the case of a reversible binding reaction, the
diffusion-limited reaction rate is given by the Smoluchowski expression, but
the crossover is revealed in the statistics of particle collision histories.

Method (MEM). It amounts to departing from the search space obtained through a
singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Kernel. Based on the shape of the SVD
basis functions we argue that the MEM spectrum for given $N_\tau$ data-points
$D(\tau)$ and prior information $m(\omega)$ does not in general lie in this
$N_\tau$ dimensional singular subspace. Systematically extending the search
basis will eventually recover the full search space and the correct extremum.
We illustrate this idea through a mock data analysis inspired by actual lattice
spectra, to show where our improvement becomes essential for the success of the
MEM. To remedy the shortcomings of Bryan's SVD prescription we propose to use
the real Fourier basis, which consists of trigonometric functions. Not only
does our approach lead to more stable numerical behavior, as the SVD is not
required for the determination of the basis functions, but also the resolution
of the MEM becomes independent from the position of the reconstructed peaks.

pattern resembles the curvature induced on the field-lines by a neighboring
charge. Not only does the latter case involve a similar curvature, it moreover
results in attraction/repulsion. This suggests a hitherto unnoticed causal
symmetry: charge acceleration-field curvature. We prove quantitatively that
these two phenomena are essentially one and the same. The field stores some of
the charge's mass, yet it is extended in space, hence when the charge
accelerates, inertia makes the field lag behind. The resulting stress in the
field stores some of the charge's kinetic energy in the form of potential
energy. The electrostatic interaction is the approximate mirror image of this
process: The potential energy stored within the field turns into the charge's
kinetic energy. This partial symmetry offers novel insights into two debated
issues in electromagnetism. The question whether a charge radiates in a
gravitational field receives a new twist: If all the charge's field-lines end
with opposite charges that also resist gravity, no radiation is expected.
Similarly for the famous absence of a physical manifestation of the Maxwell
equations' advanced solution: Just as Einstein argued, the reason for this
absence is probabilistic rather than reflecting some inherent time-asymmetry.
Despite the apparent equivalence between the ""ontological"" and
""instrumentalist"" viewpoints concerning the physical reality of field-lines,
there may be cases in which their experimental predictions differ.

framework that naturally accommodates a thermal relic dark matter candidate and
successful electroweak baryogenesis, including the needed strongly first-order
character of the electroweak phase transition. We study the phenomenology of
this setup from the standpoint of both dark matter and baryogenesis. For
energies around the electroweak phase transition temperature, the low-energy
effective theory is similar to the MSSM with light super-partners of the
third-generation quarks and of the Higgs and gauge bosons. We calculate the
dark matter relic abundance and the baryon asymmetry across the accidental
supersymmetry parameter space, including resonant and non-resonant CP-violating
sources. We find that there are regions of parameter space producing both the
observed value of the baryon asymmetry and a dark matter candidate with the
correct relic density and conforming to present-day constraints from dark
matter searches. This scenario makes sharp predictions for the particle
spectrum, predicting a lightest neutralino mass between 200 and 500 GeV, with
all charginos and neutralinos within less than a factor 2 of the lightest
neutralino mass and the heavy Higgs sector within 20-25% of that mass, making
it an interesting target for collider searches. In addition, we demonstrate
that successful accidental supersymmetric dark matter and baryogenesis will be

diffraction by infinitely thin screens in three dimensional space. Our approach
relies on new integral formulations as well as associated high-order quadrature
rules. The new integral formulations involve weighted versions of the classical
integral operators associated with the thin-screen Dirichlet and Neumann
problems as well as a generalization to the open surface problem of the
classical Calderon formulae. The high-order quadrature rules we introduce for
these operators, in turn, resolve the multiple Green function and edge
singularities (which occur at arbitrarily close distances from each other, and
which include weakly singular as well as hypersingular kernels) and thus give
rise to super-algebraically fast convergence as the discretization sizes are
increased. When used in conjunction with Krylov-subspace linear algebra solvers
such as GMRES, the resulting solvers produce results of high accuracy in small
numbers of iterations for low and high frequencies alike. We demonstrate our
methodology with a variety of numerical results for screen and aperture
problems at high frequencies---including simulation of classical experiments
such as the diffraction by a circular disc (including observation of the famous
Poisson spot), interference fringes resulting from diffraction across two
nearby circular apertures, as well as more complex geometries consisting of
multiple scatterers and cavities.

larger, regardless of its phase, so that it can be perceived by instruments

done: a high-gain linear amplifier must degrade the signal-to-noise; the noise
added by the amplifier, when referred to the input, must be at least half a
quantum at the operating frequency. This well-known quantum limit only
constrains the second moments of the added noise. Here we derive the quantum
constraints on the entire distribution of added noise: we show that any
phase-preserving linear amplifier is equivalent to a parametric amplifier with
a physical state for the ancillary mode; the noise added to the amplified field
mode is distributed according to the Wigner function of the ancilla state.

group flow that can be studied perturbatively in the limit of small $m^2/B$. We
solve the leading order explicitly. We find that, for one particular value of

of chiral symmetry enhanced by the presence of the magnetic field. In the

The ESO Public Survey VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea is a deep near-IR

covered 315 deg2 in the bulge area in the JHKs bands. We used VVV data for the
whole bulge area as a single and homogeneous data set to build for the first
time a single colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) for the entire Galactic bulge.
Photometric data in the JHKs bands were combined to produce a single and huge
data set containing 173.1M+ sources in the three bands. Selecting only the data
points flagged as stellar, the total number of sources is 84.0M+. We built the
largest CMDs published up to date, containing 173.1+ million sources for all
data points, and more than 84.0 million sources accounting for the stellar
sources only. The CMD has a complex shape, mostly owing to the complexity of
the stellar population and the effects of extinction and reddening towards the
Galactic centre. The red clump (RC) giants are seen double in magnitude at b ~
-8-10 deg, while in the inner part (b ~ 3deg) they appear to be spreading in
colour, or even splitting into a secondary peak. The analysis of the outermost
bulge area reveals a well-defined sequence of late K and M dwarfs, seen at
(J-Ks) ~ 0.7-0.9 mag and Ks~14 mag. The interpretation of the CMD yields
important information about the MW bulge, showing the fingerprint of its
structure and content. We report a well-defined red dwarf sequence in the
outermost bulge, which is important for the planetary transit searches of VVV.
The double RC in magnitude seen in the outer bulge is the signature of the
X-shaped MW bulge, while the spreading of the RC in colour are caused by
reddening effects.

strength of the Higgs-top Yukawa coupling, $| y_t|<| y^{\rm SM}_t|$, and, thus,
the electroweak vacuum stability problem may also be resolved in our scenario
without invoking new physics below the Planck scale. In addition, models with
the distorted Higgs sector provide a new framework for potentially successful
electroweak baryogenesis.

team selection in International matches. The number runs scored by batsmen and
wickets taken by bowlers serves as a natural way of quantifying the performance
of a cricketer. Traditionally the batsmen and bowlers are rated on their
batting or bowling average respectively. However in a game like Cricket it is
always important the manner in which one scores the runs or claims a wicket.
Scoring runs against a strong bowling line-up or delivering a brilliant
performance against a team with strong batting line-up deserves more credit. A
player's average is not able to capture this aspect of the game. In this paper
we present a refined method to quantify the `quality' of runs scored by a
batsman or wickets taken by a bowler. We explore the application of Social
Network Analysis (SNA) to rate the players in a team performance. We generate
directed and weighted network of batsmen-bowlers using the player-vs-player
information available for Test cricket and ODI cricket. Additionally we
generate network of batsmen and bowlers based on the dismissal record of
batsmen in the history of cricket - Test (1877-2011) and ODI (1971-2011). Our
results show that {\it M Muralitharan} is the most successful bowler in history
of Cricket. Our approach could potentially be applied in domestic matches to
judge a player's performance which in turn pave the way for a balanced team
selection for International matches.

introduce another function $\theta_{\mu}(x)$ involving $\zeta_{\mu}(x)$ and the
gamma function $\Gamma(x)$ and we show that $\log \theta_{\mu}(x)$ is strictly
increasing for $x>8e(\mu+2)^2$. This implies that
$\sqrt[n]{a_n(\mu)}<\sqrt[n+1]{a_{n+1}(\mu)}$ for $n> 4e(\mu+2)^2$. Based on
Dobinski's formula, we prove that $\sqrt[n]{B_n}<\sqrt[n+1]{B_{n+1}}$ for
$n\geq 1$, where $B_n$ is the $n$-th Bell number. This confirms another

fluctuations produced by small irregularities in the microchannel or by other

integration of the swimmer motion shows that there is stochastic resonance: The
displacement in the vorticity direction is maximized for a finite noise
intensity. This transverse displacement resonance is observed when the
displacement is coarse grained over several periods, although the director is

episodes of controversy in the history of modern cosmology, the debate over the
steady state theory in the 1950s and the recent debate concerned with the
anthropic multiverse. In addition, I draw attention to the use of historical
analogies in cosmological and other scientific arguments, suggesting that such
use is often misuse or otherwise based on distortions of the history of

allocating a certain number of bits of each codeword as markers for
synchronization. Difference systems of sets are combinatorial designs which
specify the positions of synchronization markers in codewords in such a way
that the resulting error-tolerant self-synchronizing codes may be realized as
cosets of linear codes. Ideally, difference systems of sets should sacrifice as
few bits as possible for a given code length, alphabet size, and
error-tolerance capability. However, it seems difficult to attain optimality
with respect to known bounds when the noise level is relatively low. In fact,
the majority of known optimal difference systems of sets are for exceptionally
noisy channels, requiring a substantial amount of bits for synchronization. To
address this problem, we present constructions for difference systems of sets
that allow for higher information rates while sacrificing optimality to only a
small extent. Our constructions utilize optimal difference systems of sets as
ingredients and, when applied carefully, generate asymptotically optimal ones
with higher information rates. We also give direct constructions for optimal
difference systems of sets with high information rates and error-tolerance that
generate binary and ternary self-synchronizing codes.

with no Cowling approximation.) We apply these methods to the m = 2 quadrupoles
most relevant for gravitational radiation in three cases: crustal deformations,
deformations of crystalline cores of hadron-quark hybrid stars, and
deformations of entirely crystalline color superconducting quark stars. In all
cases, we find suppressions of the quadrupole due to relativity compared to the
Newtonian Cowling approximation, particularly for compact stars. For the crust
these suppressions are up to a factor ~6, for hybrid stars they are up to ~4,
and for solid quark stars they are at most ~2, with slight enhancements instead
for low mass stars. We also explore ranges of masses and equations of state
more than in previous work, and find that for some parameters the maximum
quadrupoles can still be very large. Even with the relativistic suppressions,
we find that 1.4 solar mass stars can sustain crustal quadrupoles of a few
times 10^39 g cm^2 for the SLy equation of state or close to 10^40 g cm^2 for
equations of state that produce less compact stars. Solid quark stars of 1.4
solar masses can sustain quadrupoles of around 10^44 g cm^2. Hybrid stars
typically do not have solid cores at 1.4 solar masses, but the most massive
ones (~2 solar masses) can sustain quadrupoles of a few times 10^41 g cm^2 for
typical microphysical parameters and a few times 10^42 g cm^2 for extreme ones.

then equation (1) admits a unique solution for $\rho\in[0,8\pi)$. This result
for $\Omega$ a simply-connected domain has been extended to the case

halos is much smaller than the cosmic value, even when atomic gas is taken into
account. We find that the galactic baryon deficit increases monotonically with
decreasing halo mass, in contrast with previous studies which suggested an
approximately constant baryon fraction at the low-mass end. We argue that the
observed baryon fractions of low mass halos cannot be explained by reionization
heating alone, and that additional feedback mechanisms (e.g. supernova blowout)
