negative residual scalar curvature present even in empty spacetime. This
curvature ultimately results from postulating a discrete spacetime geometry,
very closely related to that used in the dynamical triangulations approach to
quantum gravity. In this model, there are no states which have total scalar
curvature exactly zero. Moreover, numerical evidence in dimension three
suggests that, at a fixed volume, the number of discrete-spacetime microstates
strongly increases with decreasing curvature. Because of the resulting entropic
force, any dynamics which push empty spacetime strongly toward zero scalar
curvature would instead produce typically observed states with a small negative
curvature. This provides a natural explanation for the empirically observed
small positive value for the cosmological constant (Lambda is about 10^(-121)
in Planck units.) In fact, we derive the very rough estimate Lambda=10^(-187)
from a simple model containing only the two (highly-degenerate) quantum states
with total scalar-curvature closest to zero.

bistability in its stationary states, with low- and high-amplitude branches. As
expected from the analogy with a particle in a double-well potential,
transitions between these states become possible either at finite temperature,
or in the quantum regime due to tunneling. In this analogy, besides local
stability, one can also discuss global stability by comparing the two potential
minima. For the Duffing oscillator, the stationary states emerge dynamically so
that a priori, a potential-minimum criterion for them does not exist. However,
global stability is still relevant, and definable as the state containing the
majority population for long times, low temperature, and close to the classical
limit. Further, the crossover point is the parameter value at which global
stability abruptly changes from one state to the other.
  For the double-well model, the crossover point is defined by
potential-minimum degeneracy. Given that this analogy is so effective in other
respects, it is thus striking that for the Duffing oscillator, the crossover
point turns out to be non-unique. Rather, none of the three aforementioned
limits commute with each other, and the limiting behaviour depends on the order
in which they are taken. More generally, as both $\hbar\To0$ and $T\To0$, the
ratio $\hbar\omega_0/k_\mathrm{B}T$ continues to be a key parameter and can
have any nonnegative value. This points to an apparent conceptual difference
between equilibrium and nonequilibrium tunneling. We present numerical evidence
by studying the pertinent quantum master equation in the photon-number basis.
Independent verification and some further understanding are obtained using a
semi-analytical approach in the coherent-state representation.

series associated to a metaplectic form $f$ over the cubic cover of $GL_2.$
Such a sum generalizes the work of Shimura in studying a similar quadratic
Dirichlet series for a half-weight modular form $f.$ Shimura connects the
analytic properties of his Dirichlet series to the L-function of a holomorphic
modular form via a converse theorem. This connection, and its higher cover
generalizations, has been given the name: Shimura's correspondence.
  Even assuming Shimura's correspondence for the cubic cover of $GL_2,$ the
analytic properties of our cubic Dirichlet series are intractable. However,
using Langlands's beyond endoscopy idea and analytic number theory, we get
nontrivial analytic continuation of the series. Specifically, we obtain an
asymptotic for a spectral sum of these cubic Dirichlet series plus an error
term. Assuming a certain uniformity hypothesis we can get analytic properties
of an individual cubic Dirichlet series of a metaplectic form. In particular we
show the cubic series has analytic continuation to
$\Re(s)>\frac{9}{7}+\epsilon,$ for any $\epsilon$ with at most a pole at
$s=\frac{3}{2}$ if the metaplectic form $f$ is the residual Eisenstein series.
  A key tool needed in studying this series is an identity relating cubic
exponential sums to Kloosterman sums. While we do not make a traditional trace
formula comparison in this paper, this very same identity is crucial to the
fundamental lemma in work of Mao and Rallis.

the overall exergy of the system. Consequently, this paper explores the use of
hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) as an absorber material for PVT in an
effort to maintain higher and more favourable operating temperatures for the
thermal system. Amorphous silicon not only has a smaller temperature
coefficient than c-Si, but also can display improved PV performance over
extended periods of higher temperatures by annealing out defect states from the
Staebler-Wronski effect. In order to determine the potential improvements in
a-Si:H PV performance associated with increased thicknesses of the i-layers
made possible by higher operating temperatures, a-Si:H PV cells were tested
under 1 sun illumination (AM1.5) at temperatures of 25oC (STC), 50oC
(representative PV operating conditions), and 90 oC (representative PVT
operating conditions). PV cells with an i-layer thicknesses of 420, 630 and 840
nm were evaluated at each temperature. Results show that operating a-Si:H-based
PV at 90 oC, with thicker i-layers than the cells currently used in commercial
production, provided a greater power output compared to the thinner cells
operating at either PV or PVT operating temperatures. These results indicate
that incorporating a-Si:H as the absorber material in a PVT system can improve
the thermal performance, while simultaneously improving the electrical
performance of a-Si:H-based PV.

debated issue. By analysing X-ray, optical and radio properties of a large

DR7 spectroscopic catalogue, covering a redshift range from z~0.3 to z~2.3.
SMBH masses are estimated from the Mg II emission line, bolometric luminosities
from the X-ray data, and radio emission or upper limits from the FIRST
catalogue. Most of the sources accrete close to the Eddington limit and the
distribution in radioloudness does not appear to have a bi-modal behaviour. We
confirm that radioloud AGN are also X-ray loud, with an X-ray-to-optical ratio
up to twice that of radioquiet objects, even excluding the most extreme
strongly jetted sources. By analysing complementary radio-selected control
samples, we find evidence that these conclusions are not an effect of the X-ray
selection, but are likely a property of the dominant QSO population. Our
findings are best interpreted in a context where radio emission in AGN, with
the exception of a minority of beamed sources, arises from very close to the
accretion disk and is therefore heavily linked to X-ray emission. We also
speculate that the RL/RQ dichotomy might either be an evolutionary effect that
developed well after the QSO peak epoch, or an effect of incompleteness in
small samples.

constitutes an important issue in statistical mechanics. One possibility
consists of calculating a given microcanonical quantity by means of typical
relations in the grand-canonical ensemble. But given that distinct ensembles
are equivalent only at the thermodynamic limit, a natural question is if finite
size effects would prevent such procedure. In this work we investigate
thoroughly this query in different systems yielding first and second order
phase transitions. Our study is carried out from the direct comparison with the
thermodynamic relation $(\frac{\partial s}{\partial e})$, where the entropy is
obtained from the density of states. A systematic analysis for finite sizes is
undertaken. We find that, although results become inequivalent for extreme low
system sizes, the equivalence holds true for rather small $L$'s. Therefore
direct, simple (when compared with other well established approaches) and very
precise microcanonical quantities can be obtained from the proposed method.

  In such a model, the asymptotically tight upper and lower bound on the number
of RMRs per passage through the Critical Section is Theta(log N) for the
optimal deterministic algorithms (see Yang and Anderson,1995, and Attiya,
Hendler and Woelfel, 2008). Recently, several randomized algorithms have been
devised that break the Omega(log N) barrier and need only o(log N) RMRs per

randomized ""abortable"" mutual exclusion algorithm that achieves a
sub-logarithmic expected RMR complexity. More precisely, against a weak
adversary (which can make scheduling decisions based on the entire past
history, but not the latest coin-flips of each process) every process needs an
expected number of O(log N/ log log N) RMRs to enter end exit the critical

enter the critical section within a finite number of its own steps and by
incurring O(log N/ log log N) RMRs.

heterogeneity among the means of a response variable across levels of multiple
categorical factors. In such a decomposition, the complete set of main effects
and interaction terms can be viewed as a collection of vectors, matrices and
arrays that share various index sets defined by the factor levels. For many
types of categorical factors, it is plausible that an ANOVA decomposition
exhibits some consistency across orders of effects, in that the levels of a
factor that have similar main-effect coefficients may also have similar
coefficients in higher-order interaction terms. In such a case, estimation of
the higher-order interactions should be improved by borrowing information from
the main effects and lower-order interactions. To take advantage of such
patterns, this article introduces a class of hierarchical prior distributions
for collections of interaction arrays that can adapt to the presence of such
interactions. These prior distributions are based on a type of array-variate
normal distribution, for which a covariance matrix for each factor is
estimated. This prior is able to adapt to potential similarities among the
levels of a factor, and incorporate any such information into the estimation of
the effects in which the factor appears. In the presence of such similarities,
this prior is able to borrow information from well-estimated main effects and
lower-order interactions to assist in the estimation of higher-order terms for
which data information is limited.

measurements, together with a suite of coeval radio, submm and infrared data,
we performed a SED fitting of NGC 1275 using a model that contains
contributions from dust emission as well as synchrotron AGN emission. The data
indicate a low dust emissivity index, beta ~ 1, a total dust mass close to 10^7

component with temperature of 116 \pm 9 K. The FIR-derived star formation rate

conducted using the radiative transfer code, CLOUDY, a heating model comprising

find a [OI]/[CII] ratio about 1 dex smaller than predicted by the otherwise

both boost the lightest Higgs boson mass $m_{h}$ and also make radiative

where the stop trilinear mixing term $A_t$ is set to give $A_t^2/M_S^2 = 6$,
allows the stops to be as light as possible for a given $m_h$. Here we make the
distinction between minimal $M_S$ and optimal naturalness, showing that the
latter occurs for less-than-maximal mixing. Lagrange constrained optimisation
reveals that the two coincide closely in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard
Model (MSSM) -- optimally we have $5 < A_t^2/M_S^2 < 6$. We discuss why the two
are not generally expected to coincide beyond the MSSM, and that even within
the MSSM different models should not be compared based on the $M_S$ necessary
to achieve a given $m_{h}$. The splitting between the two stop-mass eigenvalues
$m_{\tilde{t}_2} - m_{\tilde{t}_1}$ is shown to be unconstrained by naturalness

(Wr(MgII)>0.3 A) MgII absorbers, with redshifts 0.2<z<2.5, measured in 81
quasar spectra obtained from the Very Large Telescope(VLT)/Ultraviolet and
Visual Echelle Spectrograph(UVES) archives of high-resolution spectra (R \sim
45,000). No evolutionary trend in Wr(FeII)/Wr(MgII) is found for moderately
strong MgII absorbers (0.3<Wr(MgII)<1.0 A). However, at lower z we find an
absence of very strong MgII absorbers (those with Wr(MgII)>1 A) with small
ratios of equivalent widths of FeII to MgII. At high z, very strong MgII
absorbers with both small and large Wr(FeII)/Wr(MgII) values are present. We
compare our findings to a sample of 100 weak MgII absorbers (Wr(MgII)<0.3 A)
found in the same quasar spectra by Narayanan et al. (2007).
  The main effect driving the evolution of very strong MgII systems is the
difference between the kinematic profiles at low and high redshifts. At high z,
we observe that, among the very strong MgII absorbers, all of the systems with
small ratios of Wr(FeII)/Wr(MgII) have relatively large velocity spreads,
resulting in less saturated profiles. At low z, such kinematically spread
systems are absent, and both FeII and MgII are saturated, leading to
Wr(FeII)/Wr(MgII) values that are all close to 1. The high redshift, small
Wr(FeII)/Wr(MgII) systems could correspond to sub-DLA systems, many of which
have large velocity spreads and are possibly linked to superwinds in star
forming galaxies. In addition to the change in saturation due to kinematic
evolution, the smaller Wr(FeII)/Wr(MgII) values could be due to a lower
abundance of Fe at high z, which would indicate relatively early stages of star
formation in those environments.

have univalent families classifying (n-2)-truncated maps. We show that
univalent families are preserved (and detected) by right adjoints to locally
cartesian localizations, and use this to exhibit certain canonical univalent
families in infinity-quasitopoi (certain infinity-categories of ""separated

univalent families, illustrating that a univalent family in an n-topos need not
be (n-2)-truncated, as well as some univalent families in the Morel--Voevodsky
infinity-category of motivic spaces, an instance of a locally cartesian closed
infinity-category which is not an n-topos for any $0\leq n\leq\infty$. Lastly,
we show that any presentable locally cartesian closed infinity-category is
modeled by a combinatorial type-theoretic model category, and conversely that
the infinity-category underlying a combinatorial type-theoretic model category
is presentable and locally cartesian closed. Under this correspondence,
univalent families in presentable locally cartesian closed infinity-categories
correspond to univalent fibrations in combinatorial type-theoretic model
categories.

converging hierarchy of convex finite-dimensional linear matrix inequalities
(LMIs). Our approach is genuinely primal in the sense that convexity of the
problem of computing the ROA is an outcome of optimizing directly over system
trajectories. The dual infinite-dimensional LP on nonnegative continuous
functions (approximated by polynomial sum-of-squares) allows us to generate a
hierarchy of semialgebraic outer approximations of the ROA at the price of
solving a sequence of LMI problems with asymptotically vanishing conservatism.
This sharply contrasts with the existing literature which follows an
exclusively dual Lyapunov approach yielding either nonconvex bilinear matrix
inequalities or conservative LMI conditions. The approach is simple and readily
applicable as the outer approximations are the outcome of a single semidefinite
program with no additional data required besides the problem description.

surrounding nuclear waste disposals at great depth, the thermal expansion of
the constituents generates excess pore pressures. The mass of clay is submitted
to gradients of pore pressure and temperature, to hydraulic and thermal flows,
and to changes in its mechanical properties. In this work, some of these
aspects were experimentally studied in the case of Boom clay, so as to help
predicting the response of the soil, in relation with investigations made in
the Belgian underground laboratory at Mol. Results of slow heating tests with
careful volume change measurements showed that a reasonable prediction of the
thermal expansion of the clay-water system was obtained by using the thermal
properties of free water. In spite of the density of Boom clay, no significant
effect of water adsorption was observed. The thermal consolidation of Boom clay
was studied through fast heating tests. A simple analysis shows that the
hydraulic and thermal transfers are uncoupled. Experimental results from fast
heating tests showed that the consolidation coefficient does not change
significantly with increased temperature, due to the opposite effect of
increasing permeability and decreasing porosity. The changes of permeability
with temperature were investigated by running constant head measurements at
various temperatures. An indirect analysis, based on the estimation of the mv
consolidation parameter, showed that the indirect method of estimating the
permeability from consolidation tests should be considered carefully. Intrinsic
permeability values were derived by considering the change of the viscosity of
free water with temperature. A unique relationship between the intrinsic
permeability and the porosity was observed, with no dependence on temperature,
confirming that the flow involved in the permeability test only concerns free
water.

of 55 Hickson Compact Groups (HCG) and 309 galaxies from the Catalog of
Isolated Galaxies (CIG). The SFH traces the variation of star formation over
the lifetime of a galaxy, and yields consequently a snapshot picture of its
formation. Comparing the SFHs in these extremes in galaxy density, allows us to
determine the main effects of Compact Groups (CG) on the formation of galaxies.
We fit our spectra using the spectral synthesis code STARLIGHT and obtain the
stellar population contents and mean stellar ages of HCG and CIG galaxies in
three different morphological classes: early-type galaxies (EtG), early-type
spirals (EtS), and late-type spirals (LtS). We find that EtG and EtS galaxies
in HCG show larger contents of old and intermediate stellar populations as well
as an important deficit of the young stellar population, what clearly implies
an older average stellar age in early galaxies in HCG. For LtS galaxies we find
similar mean values for the stellar content and age in the two samples.
However, we note that LtS can be split into two subclasses, namely old and
young LtS. In HCG we find a higher fraction of young LtS than in the CIG
sample, in addition, most of these galaxies belong to groups where most of the
galaxies are also young and actively forming stars. The Specific Star Formation
Rate (SSFR) of spiral galaxies in the two samples differ. EtS in HCG show lower
values of the SSFR, while LtS peak at higher values when comparing with their
counterparts in isolation. We have also measured shorter Star Formation Time
Scale (SFTS) in HCG galaxies, indicating that they have less prolonged star
formation activity than CIG galaxies.

consistent with being aligned with the binary orbital planes. Though secular
perturbations from the binary can align the disk, in both cases the alignment
time at the distances at which the disk is resolved is greater than the stellar
age, so we conclude that the coplanarity was primordial. Neither disk can be
modelled as a narrow ring, requiring extended radial distributions. To satisfy
both the Herschel and mid-IR images of the alpha CrB disk, we construct a model
that extends from 1-300AU, whose radial profile is broadly consistent with a
picture where planetesimal collisions are excited by secular perturbations from
the binary. However, this model is also consistent with stirring by other
mechanisms, such as the formation of Pluto-sized objects. The beta Tri disk
model extends from 50-400AU. A model with depleted (rather than empty) inner
regions also reproduces the observations and is consistent with binary and
other stirring mechanisms. As part of the modelling process, we find that the
Herschel PACS beam varies by as much as 10% at 70um and a few % at 100um. The
70um variation can therefore hinder image interpretation, particularly for
poorly resolved objects. The number of systems in which circumbinary debris
disk orientations have been compared with the binary plane is now four. More
systems are needed, but a picture in which disks around very close binaries
(alpha CrB, beta Tri, and HD 98800, with periods of a few weeks to a year) are
aligned, and disks around wider binaries (99 Her, with a 50 yr period) are
misaligned, may be emerging. This picture is qualitatively consistent with the
expectation that the protoplanetary disks from which the debris emerged are
more likely to be aligned if their binaries have shorter periods.

water content will soon be discovered. Water content helps determine surface
land fraction, which influences planetary weathering behavior. This is
important because the silicate weathering feedback determines the width of the
habitable zone in space and time. Here a low-order model of weathering and
climate, useful for gaining qualitative understanding, is developed to examine
climate evolution for planets of various land-ocean fractions. It is pointed
out that, if seafloor weathering does not depend directly on surface
temperature, there can be no weathering-climate feedback on a waterworld. This
would dramatically narrow the habitable zone of a waterworld. Results from our
model indicate that weathering behavior does not depend strongly on land
fraction for partially ocean-covered planets. This is powerful because it
suggests that previous habitable zone theory is robust to changes in land
fraction, as long as there is some land. Finally, a mechanism is proposed for a
waterworld to prevent complete water loss during a moist greenhouse through
rapid weathering of exposed continents. This process is named a ""waterworld
self-arrest,"" and it implies that waterworlds can go through a moist greenhouse
stage and end up as planets like Earth with partial ocean coverage. This work
stresses the importance of surface and geologic effects, in addition to the
usual incident stellar flux, for habitability.

cosmic voids through gamma-ray observations. In addition, dissipation of such
beams could affect considerably the thermal history of the intergalactic medium

of the blazar induced electromagnetic shower, in particular the bulk Lorentz
factor and the angular spread of the pair beam generated by the shower, as a
function of distance from the blazar itself. We then use linear and nonlinear
kinetic theory to study the stability of the pair beam against the growth of
electrostatic plasma waves, employing the Monte Carlo results for our
quantitative estimates. We find that the fastest growing mode, like any
perturbation mode with even a very modest component perpendicular to the beam
direction, cannot be described in the reactive regime. Due to the effect of
non-linear Landau damping, which suppresses the growth of plasma oscillations,
the beam relaxation timescale is found significantly longer than the inverse
Compton loss time. Finally, density inhomogeneities associated with cosmic
structure induce loss of resonance between the beam particles and plasma
oscillations, strongly inhibiting their growth. We conclude that relativistic
pair beams produced by blazars in the intergalactic medium are stable on
timescales long compared to the electromagnetic cascade's. There appears to be
little or no effect of pair-beams on the intergalactic medium.

star formation rates out to beyond 2R_200 in all groups, down to a completeness

For the first time we also report a similar suppression of the specific star

thus directly revealing the impact of the group environment in quenching star
formation within infalling galaxies. At fixed galaxy density and stellar mass,
this suppression is stronger in more massive groups, implying that both local

average quenching timescale of at least ~2 Gyr and strongly suggest that a
combination of tidal interactions and starvation is responsible. Despite their

given meaning in the context of an electroweak chiral Lagrangian, but it might

constraints on the centre of DM, we use an automated strong-lensing analysis,
mass-modelling technique which is based on the well-tested assumption that
light traces mass. The cluster galaxies are modelled with a steep power-law,
and the DM component is obtained by smoothing the galaxy distribution fitting a
low-order 2D polynomial (via spline interpolation), while probing a whole range
of polynomial degrees and galaxy power laws. We find that the offsets between
the BCG and the peak of the smoothed light map representing the DM, \Delta, are
distributed equally around zero with no preferred direction, and are well
described by a log-normal distribution with <log_{10}(\Delta [h^{-1}
Mpc])>=-1.895^{+0.003}_{-0.004}, and \sigma=0.501\pm0.004 (95% confidence
levels), or <log_{10}(\Delta [\arcsec])>=0.564\pm0.005, and
\sigma=0.475\pm0.007. Some of the offsets originate in prior misidentifications
of the BCG or other bright cluster members by the cluster finding algorithm,
whose level we make an additional effort to assess, finding that ~10% of the
clusters in the probed catalogue are likely to be misidentified, contributing
to higher-end offsets in general agreement with previous studies. Our results
constitute the first statistically-significant high-resolution distributions of
DM-to-BCG offsets obtained in an observational analysis, and importantly show
that there exists such a typical non-zero offset in the probed catalogue. The
offsets show a weak positive correlation with redshift, so that higher
separations are generally found for higher-z clusters in agreement with the
hierarchical growth of structure, which in turn could help characterise the
merger, relaxation and evolution history of clusters, in future studies.

sufficiently large that, if transferred to the envelope of the host star during
the red giant branch (RGB) evolution, it can spin-up the star's rotation to
unusually large speeds. This spin-up mechanism is one possible explanation for
the rapid rotators detected among the population of generally slow-rotating red
giant stars. These rapid rotators thus comprise a unique stellar sample
suitable for searching for signatures of planet accretion in the form of
unusual stellar abundances due to the dissemination of the accreted planet in
the stellar envelope. In this study, we look for signatures of replenishment in
the Li abundances and (to a lesser extent) 12C/13C, which are both normally
lowered during RGB evolution. Accurate abundances were measured from high
signal-to-noise echelle spectra for samples of both slow and rapid rotator red
giant stars. We find that the rapid rotators are on average enriched in lithium
compared to the slow rotators, but both groups of stars have identical
distributions of 12C/13C within our measurement precision. Both of these
abundance results are consistent with the accretion of planets of only a few
Jupiter masses. We also explore alternative scenarios for understanding the
most Li-rich stars in our sample---particularly Li regeneration during various
stages of stellar evolution. Finally, we find that our stellar samples show
non-standard abundances even at early RGB stages, suggesting that initial
protostellar Li abundances and 12C/13C may be more variable than originally
thought.

pressures. A preconditioned conjugate gradient method is used in the algorithm
with either a lumped or a Dirichlet preconditioner, and scalable convergence

process, which could explain the spatial location of the observed iron
enhancements just outside the traditional flux rope magnetic signatures and
between the two ICMEs. Detailed comparisons between the simulations and data
were more complicated, but a sharp increase in high iron charge states in the

ghost-free nonlinear bimetric theories. This can be achieved in a simple way by
first considering linear massive spin-2 perturbations around maximally
symmetric background solutions, for which the linear gauge symmetry at the
Higuchi bound is easily identified. Then, requiring consistency between an
appropriate subset of these transformations and the dynamical nature of the
backgrounds, fixes all but one parameter in the bimetric interaction potential.
This specifies the theory up to the value of the Fierz-Pauli mass and leads to
the unique candidate for nonlinear partially massless bimetric theory.

corresponding magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, dielectric permittivity
and ferroelectric polarization are systematically investigated. A long-range
magnetic ordering arises below the N\'{e}el temperature (around 40K) in each
member of the \alpha-MCr_2O_4 family, which changes to the quasi-120\degree
proper-screw-type helical spin structure at low temperature. A very small but
confirmed spontaneous electric polarization emerges concomitantly with this
magnetic ordering. The direction of electric polarization is found within the
basal triangular plane. The multiferroicity in \alpha-MCr_2O_4 can not be
explained within the frameworks of the magnetic exchange striction or the
inverse Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The observed results are more
compatible with the newly proposed Arima mechanism that is associated the d-p
hybridization between the ligand and transition metal ions, modified by the
spin-orbit coupling. The evolution of multiferroic properties with the
increasing inter-planar spacing (as M changes from Ca to Ba) reveals the
importance of interlayer interaction in this new family of frustrated magnetic

Finsler geometry. A Finsler metric is defined on the surface by using an
underlying vector field, which is an in-plane tilt order. According to the
orientation of the vector field, the Finsler length becomes dependent on both
position and direction on the surface, and for this reason the parameters such
as the surface tension and bending rigidity become anisotropic. To confirm that
the model is well-defined, we perform Monte Carlo simulations under several
isotropic conditions such as those given by random vector fields. The results
are comparable to those of previous simulations of the conventional model. It
is also found that a tubular phase appears when the vector field is constant.
Moreover, we find that the tilts form the Kosterlitz-Thouless and low
temperature configurations, which correspond to two different anisotropic
phases such as disk and tubular, in the model in which the tilt variable is
assumed to be a dynamical variable. This confirms that the model in this paper
may be used as an anisotropic model for membranes.

the traditional interpretation is synchrotron radiation of non-thermal
electrons accelerated in internal shocks or magnetic dissipation regions, a
growing trend in the community is to interpret this component as modified
thermal emission from a dissipative photosphere of a GRB fireball. We analyze
the time dependent spectrum of GRB 110721A detected by {\em Fermi} GBM and LAT,
and pay special attention to the rapid evolution of the peak energy $E_p$. We
define a ""death line"" of thermally-dominated dissipative photospheric emission
in the $E_p - L$ plane, and show that $E_p$ of GRB 110721A at the earliest
epoch has a very high $E_p \sim 15$ MeV that is beyond the ""death line"".
Together with the finding that an additional ""shoulder"" component exists in
this burst that is consistent with a photospheric origin, we suggest that at
least for some bursts, the ""Band"" component is not from a dissipative
photosphere, but must invoke a non-thermal origin (e.g. synchrotron or inverse
Compton) in the optically thin region of a GRB outflow. We also suggest that
the rapid ""hard-to-soft"" spectral evolution is consistent with the quick
discharge of magnetic energy in a magnetically-dominated outflow in the
optically thin region.

low-energy nu2 bending mode at frequencies between 1654--1897 GHz using HIFI on
board Herschel, in DR21(OH), a high mass star forming region. Several
transitions of CCH and c-C3H2 have also been observed with HIFI and the IRAM
30m telescope. A gas and grain warm-up model was used to identify the primary
C3 forming reactions in DR21(OH). We have detected C3 in absorption in four
far-infrared transitions, P(4), P(10), Q(2) and Q(4). The continuum sources MM1
and MM2 in DR21(OH) though spatially unresolved, are sufficiently separated in
velocity to be identified in the C3 spectra. All C3 transitions are detected
from the embedded source MM2 and the surrounding envelope, whereas only Q(4) &
P(4) are detected toward the hot core MM1. The abundance of C3 in the envelope
and MM2 is \sim6x10^{-10} and \sim3x10^{-9} respectively. For CCH and c-C3H2 we
only detect emission from the envelope and MM1. The observed CCH, C3, and
c-C3H2 abundances are most consistent with a chemical model with
n(H2)\sim5x10^{6} cm^-3 post-warm-up dust temperature, T_max =30 K and a time
of \sim0.7-3 Myr. Post warm-up gas phase chemistry of CH4 released from the
grain at t\sim 0.2 Myr and lasting for 1 Myr can explain the observed C3
abundance in the envelope of DR21(OH) and no mechanism involving
photodestruction of PAH molecules is required. The chemistry in the envelope is
similar to the warm carbon chain chemistry (WCCC) found in lukewarm corinos.
The observed lower C3 abundance in MM1 as compared to MM2 and the envelope
could be indicative of destruction of C3 in the more evolved MM1. The timescale
for the chemistry derived for the envelope is consistent with the dynamical
timescale of 2 Myr derived for DR21(OH) in other studies.

gaseous substructures in barred galaxies and their relationships with the bar
strength. The gaseous medium is assumed to be isothermal and unmagnetized. The
bar potential is modeled as a Ferrers prolate with index n. To explore
situations with differing bar strength, we vary the bar mass fbar relative to
the spheroidal component as well as its aspect ratio. We derive expressions as
functions of fbar and the aspect ratio for the bar strength Qb and the radius
r(Qb) where the maximum bar torque occurs. When applied to observations, these
expressions suggest that bars in real galaxies are most likely to have
fbar=0.25-0.5 and n<1. Dust lanes approximately follow one of x1-orbits and
tend to be more straight under a stronger and more elongated bar, but are
insensitive to the presence of self-gravity. A nuclear ring of a conventional
x2 type forms only when the bar is not so massive or elongated. The radius of
an x2-type ring is generally smaller than the inner Lindblad resonance,
decreases systematically with increasing Qb, and slightly larger when
self-gravity is included. This evidences that the ring position is not
determined by the resonance but by the amount of angular momentum loss at
dust-lane shocks. Nuclear spirals exist only when the ring is of the x2-type
and sufficiently large in size. Unlike the other features, nuclear spirals are
transient in that they start out as being tightly-wound and weak, and then due
to the nonlinear effect unwind and become stronger until turning into shocks,
with an unwinding rate higher for larger Qb. The mass inflow rate to the galaxy
center is found to be less than 0.01 Msun/yr for models with Qb<0.2, while
becoming larger than 0.1 Msun/yr when Qb>0.2 and self-gravity is included.

we found that the amplitude of the modulation and peak intensity changed by > 1

a power spectrum density of P(f) propto f^(-2) but the folded X-ray light

are difficult to reconcile with each other. The widely accepted presence of
clumping in hot star winds implies a significant reduction of observational
mass-loss rate estimates from diagnostics that depend on the square of the
density. Moreover, the ultraviolet Pv resonance lines indicate a possible need
for even stronger reduction of hot star mass-loss rates, provided that Pv is a
dominant ionization stage of phosphorus at least in some hot stars. The latter
assumption is challenged by a possible presence of the XUV radiation.
  Here we study the influence of the XUV radiation on the Pv ionization
fraction in the hot star winds. By a detailed solution of the hydrodynamical,
radiative transfer, and statistical equilibrium equations we confirm that
sufficiently strong XUV radiation source may decrease the Pv ionization
fraction, possibly depreciating the Pv lines as a reliable mass-loss rate
indicator. On the other hand, the XUV radiation influences also the ionization
fraction of heavier ions that drive the wind, leading to a decrease of the wind
terminal velocity. Consequently, we conclude that the XUV radiation alone can
not bring theory and observations in accord.
  We fit our predicted wind mass-loss rates by a suitable formula and compare
the results with the observational mass-loss rate diagnostics. We show that for
supergiants and giants the theoretical predictions do not contradict the
mass-loss rate estimates based on X-ray line profiles or density squared
diagnostics. On the other hand, for main-sequence stars the predicted mass-loss
rates are still significantly higher than that inferred from Pv or X-ray lines.
This indicates that the ""weak wind problem"" recently detected in low-luminosity
main-sequence stars may occur to some extent also for the stars with higher
luminosity.

generate a MD in their goodness senses for boosting generalization. Unlike
their indirect control over MD, in this paper, we propose an alternative
boosting algorithm termed Margin distribution Controlled Boosting (MCBoost)
which directly controls the MD by introducing and optimizing a key adjustable
margin parameter. MCBoost's optimization implementation adopts the column
generation technique to ensure fast convergence and small number of weak
classifiers involved in the final MCBooster. We empirically demonstrate: 1)
AdaBoost is actually also a MD controlled algorithm and its iteration number

compared in their mechanical action when used for hydraulic fracturing? By
employing the modified formulation of the PKN problem we obtain its simple
analytical solutions in the cases of perfectly plastic and Newtonian fluids.
Since the results for shear thinning fluids are intermediate between those for
these cases, the obtained equation for the fracture length suggests a criterion
of the equivalence of various shear thinning fluids for the problem of
hydraulic fractures. We assume fluids equivalent in their hydrofracturing
action, when at a reference time they produce fractures of the same length. The
equation for the fracture length translates the equivalence in terms of the
hydraulic fracture length and treatment time into the equivalence in terms of
the properties of a fracturing fluid (behavior and consistency indices).
Analysis shows that the influence of the consistency and behavior indices on
the fracture length, particle velocity and propagation speed is quite similar
when considering the PKN and KGD models despite the models refer to different
plain-strain states. It appears that from the mechanical point of view, the
differences between thinning fluids are not significant; they may be taken into
account when wishing to have some quantity to be greater (less) at small
(large) time. We conclude that a choice of a fracturing fluid is to be made
mostly from technological and/or economic considerations under the condition
that the compared fluids are equivalent in their mechanical effect according to
the suggested criterion.

stronger for the 100 Live Days data. Secondly we find that, due to the two
points at low values of S1 and S2 in the 225 days data-set, our analysis points
to either weak consistency with low-mass Dark Matter or the possible presence
of an unknown background. Given the null-result from LUX, the latter scenario

and may be key to explaining timing irregularities such as pulsar glitches.
However, most models for this phenomenon exclude the global instability
required to trigger the event. In this paper we discuss a mechanism that may
fill this gap. We establish that small scale inertial r-modes become unstable
in a superfluid neutron star that exhibits a rotational lag, expected to build
up due to vortex pinning as the star spins down. Somewhat counterintuitively,
this instability arises due to the (under normal circumstances dissipative)
vortex-mediated mutual friction. We explore the nature of the superfluid
instability for a simple incompressible model, allowing for entrainment
coupling between the two fluid components. Our results recover a previously
discussed dynamical instability in systems where the two components are
strongly coupled. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time that the
system is secularly unstable (with a growth time that scales with the mutual
friction) throughout much of parameter space. Interestingly, large scale
r-modes are also affected by this new aspect of the instability. We analyse the
damping effect of shear viscosity, which should be particularly efficient at
small scales, arguing that it will not be sufficient to completely suppress the
instability in astrophysical systems.

approaches to scaling up entity resolution (ER) to multiple data sources: the
prohibitive cost of labeling training data for supervised learning of
similarity scores for each pair of sources. While there exists a rich
literature describing almost all aspects of pairwise ER, this new challenge is
arising now due to the unprecedented ability to acquire and store data from
online sources, features driven by ER such as enriched search verticals, and
the uniqueness of noisy and missing data characteristics for each source. We
show on real-world and synthetic data that for state-of-the-art techniques, the
reality of heterogeneous sources means that the number of labeled training data
must scale quadratically in the number of sources, just to maintain constant
precision/recall. We address this challenge with a brand new transfer learning
algorithm which requires far less training data (or equivalently, achieves
superior accuracy with the same data) and is trained using fast convex
optimization. The intuition behind our approach is to adaptively share
structure learned about one scoring problem with all other scoring problems
sharing a data source in common. We demonstrate that our theoretically
motivated approach incurs no runtime cost while it can maintain constant
precision/recall with the cost of labeling increasing only linearly with the
number of sources.

collected in clusters, an important aspect that should be accounted for is the

aim we propose an approach based on nested hidden (latent) Markov chains, which
are associated to every sample unit and to every cluster. The approach allows
us to account for the mentioned forms of unobserved heterogeneity in a dynamic
fashion; it also allows us to account for the correlation which may arise
between the responses provided by the units belonging to the same cluster.
Given the complexity in computing the manifest distribution of these response
variables, we make inference on the proposed model through a composite
likelihood function based on all the possible pairs of subjects within every
cluster. The proposed approach is illustrated through an application to a
dataset concerning a sample of Italian workers in which a binary response

case where on $i\R$ the interpolating polynomials are to be positive

degree interpolating polynomial $P(s)$ which on $i\R$ is Hermitian. Then we
find all polynomials $\Psi(s)$, vanishing at the interpolation points which are
positive semidefinite on $i\R$. Finally, using the fact that the set of
positive semidefinite matrices is a convex subcone of Hermitian matrices, one
can compute the minimal scalar $\hat{\beta}\geq 0$ so that $P(s)+\beta\Psi(s)$
satisfies all interpolation constraints for all $\beta\geq\hat{\beta}$. This
approach is then adapted to cases when the family of interpolating polynomials

The problem is reduced to an eigenvalue system and the properties of the

number of symmetric and skew-symmetric modes. Asymptotic expansions in the far
field, associated with long wavelength homogenisation are presented. Asymptotic
expressions for Green's function in the vicinity of the band edge are also

compared with the asymptotic expansions. The case of an infinite defect is also

initial geometry is measured over a broad range in transverse momentum 0.5
GeV<pT<9 GeV, and centrality (0-50)% in Pb-Pb collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=2.76
TeV, recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The v1 coefficient is
determined via a two-component fit of the first order Fourier coefficient,
v_{1,1}= cos \Delta\phi, of two-particle correlations in azimuthal angle
\Delta\phi=\phi_a-\phi_b as a function of pT^a and pT^b. This fit is motivated
by the finding that the pT dependence of v_{1,1}(pT^a,pT^b) data are consistent
with the combined contributions from a rapidity-even v1 and global momentum
conservation. The magnitude of the extracted momentum conservation component
suggests that the system conserving momentum involves only a subset of the
event (spanning about 3 units in \eta in central collisions). The extracted v1
is observed to cross zero at pT~1.0 GeV, reaches a maximum at 4-5 GeV with a
value comparable to that for v3, and decreases at higher pT. Interestingly, the
magnitude of v1 at high pT exceeds the value of the v3 in all centrality
interval and exceeds the value of v2 in central collisions. This behavior
suggests that the path-length dependence of energy loss and initial dipole
asymmetry from fluctuations corroborate to produce a large dipolar anisotropy
for high pT hadrons, making the v1 a valuable probe for studying the jet
quenching phenomena.

symmetry breaking by strong Yukawa dynamics. Technically, the symmetry is
assumed to be broken by formation of symmetry-breaking parts of both the scalar
and the fermion propagators, rather than by the scalar vacuum expectation
values. The idea is first introduced on an example of a toy model with the
underlying symmetry being an Abelian one and later applied to a realistic model
of electroweak interaction. In addition, the thesis also deals with some more
general, model-independent issues, applicable not only to the discussed model
of strong Yukawa dynamics, but to a wider class of models with dynamical mass
generation. First of these issues is the problem of fermion flavor mixing in
the presence of fermion self-energies with a general momentum dependence. It is
in particular shown how to define the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix in
such models and argued that it can come out in principle non-unitary. Second
issue is the problem of calculating the gauge boson masses when the symmetry is
broken by fermion self-energies. On top of deriving the formula for the gauge
boson mass matrix we also find corrections to the related Pagels-Stokar

In \cite{HZ76}, F. Hirzebruch and D. Zagier introduced Hirzebruch-Zagier
cycles, that could also be called twisted diagonals. These are maps $\HH \to
\HH \times \HH^-$ given by $z \mapsto (Mz,-M^\sigma z)$ where $M \in
\GL_2^+(K)$ and $\sigma$ denotes the Galois conjugate. The projection of a
twisted diagonal to $X_D$ yields a Kobayashi curve, i.e. an algebraic curve
which is a geodesic for the Kobayashi metric on $X_D$. Properties of
Hirzebruch-Zagier cycles have been abundantly studied in the
literature.\\Teichm\""uller curves are algebraic curves in the moduli space of
Riemann surfaces $\mathcal{M}_g$, which are geodesic for the Kobayashi metric.
Some Teichm\""uller curves in $\mathcal{M}_2$, namely the primitive ones, can
also be regarded as Kobayashi curves on $X_D$. This implies that in the
universal cover the curve is of the form $z \mapsto (z,\varphi(z))$ for some
holomorphic map $\varphi$. A possibility to construct even more Kobayashi
curves on $X_D$ is to consider the projection of $(Mz,M^\sigma\varphi(z))$ to
$X_D$ where again $M \in \GL_2^+(K)$. These new objects are called twisted
Teichm\""uller curves because their construction reminds very much of twisted
diagonals. In these notes we analyze twisted Teichm\""uller curves in detail and

distributed over the network. The content distribution techniques have recently
started to embrace peer-to-peer (P2P) systems as an alternative to the
traditional client-server architecture. P2P systemsthat are based on the
BitTorrent protocol uses end-users' resources to provide a cost effective
distribution of bandwidth intensive content to thousands of users. The
BitTorrent protocol system offers a scalable mechanism for distributing a large
volume of data to a set of peers over the Internet. With the growing demand for
file sharing and content distribution, BitTorrent has become one of the most
popular Internet applications and contributes to a signification fraction of
the Internet traffic. With the wide usage of the BitTorrent protocol system, it
has basically solved one of the major problems where data can be quickly
transferred to a group of interested parties. The strength of the BitTorrent
protocol lies in efficient bandwidth utilization for the downloading and
uploading processes. However, the usage of BitTorrent protocol also causes
latency for other applications in terms of network bandwidth which in turn has
caused concerns for the Internet Service Providers, who strives for quality of
service for all their customers. In this paper, we study the network traffic
patterns of theBitTorrent network traffic and investigate its behavior by
usingthe time series ARMA model. Our experimental results show that BitTorrent
network traffic can be modeled and forecasted by using ARMA models. We compared
and evaluated the forecasted network traffic with the real traffic patterns.
This modeling can be utilized by the Internet Service Providers to manage their
network bandwidth and also detect any abnormality in their network.

that scale decoupling in general is not complete. Thus early time, i.e.
non-potential effects, significantly modify the shape of the lowest peak. We

advantage of the XRT is that we can also explore the soft band not covered by

extending down to close to the black hole in the low hard state, and to show
low frequency variability in the soft band intrinsic to this disk. Our results
are consistent with this, with at low intensities stronger low-frequency
variability in the soft than in the hard band. From our analysis we are able to
present the first measurements of the soft band variability in the peak of the
outburst and find it to be less variable than the hard band, especially at high
frequencies, opposite to what is seen at low intensity. Both results can be
explained within the framework of a simple two emission-region model where the
hot flow is more variable in the peak of the outburst and the disk is more

pseudo-range and carrier phase measurement but also can result in a complete

spot number (SSN), Geomagnetic index (o < Kp < 9), time of year, time of day,
geographical position. Most scintillation occurs for a few hours after sunset
during the peak years of the solar cycle. Typically delay locked loop/phase

New opacity distribution functions were generated to calculate ATLAS9 model

techniques. The metallicity ([M/H]) spans from -5 to 1.5 for ATLAS and -2.5 to
0.5 for MARCS models. There are three main differences with respect to previous
ATLAS9 model grids: a new corrected H2O linelist, a wide range of carbon
([C/M]) and alpha element [alpha/M] variations, and solar reference abundances
from Asplund et al. 2005. The added range of varying carbon and alpha element
abundances also extends the previously calculated MARCS model grids. Altogether
1980 chemical compositions were used for the ATLAS9 grid, and 175 for the MARCS
grid. Over 808 thousand ATLAS9 models were computed spanning temperatures from
3500K to 30000K and log g from 0 to 5, where larger temperatures only have high
gravities. The MARCS models span from 3500K to 5500K, and log g from 0 to 5.

xy and yz, which are half-filled gapped states at the Fermi level, and
itinerant zx, 3z^2-r^2 and x^2-y^2. We argue that orbital ordering between yz

field with Chern-Simons coupling. In the absence of charge, the magnetic field
induces an RG flow to an infrared AdS$_3 \times {\bf R}^2$ geometry, which is
dual to a 2-dimensional CFT representing strongly interacting fermions in the
lowest Landau level. Two asymptotic Virasoro algebras and one chiral Kac-Moody
algebra arise as {\sl emergent symmetries} in the IR. Including a nonzero
charge density reveals a quantum critical point when the magnetic field reaches
a critical value whose scale is set by the charge density. The critical theory
is probed by the study of long-distance correlation functions of the boundary
stress tensor and current. All quantities of major physical interest in this

analytically. We also study an asymptotically AdS$_6$ system whose magnetic
field induced quantum critical point is governed by a IR Lifshitz geometry,
holographically dual to a D=2+1 field theory. The behavior of these holographic
theories shares important similarities with that of real world quantum critical
systems obtained by tuning a magnetic field, and may be relevant to materials

batching verification tasks for presentation to human workers but even with
batching, a human-only approach is infeasible for data sets of even moderate

hybrid human-machine approach in which machines are used to do an initial,
coarse pass over all the data, and people are used to verify only the most
likely matching pairs. We show that for such a hybrid system, generating the
minimum number of verification tasks of a given size is NP-Hard, but we develop
a novel two-tiered heuristic approach for creating batched tasks. We describe
this method, and present the results of extensive experiments on real data sets

above room temperature. As a consequence, classical molecular dynamics
simulations of their liquids largely underestimate the energy of modes with a

covalent interatomic distances due to anharmonic effects. Zero-point effects
can be recovered using path integral molecular dynamics simulations, but these
are computationally expensive, making their combination with ab initio
molecular dynamics simulations a challenge. As an alternative to path integral
methods, from a computationally simple perspective, one would envision the
design of a thermostat capable of equilibrating and maintaining the different
vibrational modes at their corresponding zero-point temperatures. Recently,
Ceriotti et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. 102 020601 (2009)) introduced a framework to
use a custom-tailored Langevin equation with correlated noise that can be used
to include quantum fluctuations in classical molecular dynamics simulations.
Here we show that it is possible to use the generalized Langevin equation with
suppressed noise in combination with Nose-Hoover thermostats to efficiently
impose a zero-point temperature on independent modes in liquid water. Using our
simple and inexpensive method, we achieve excellent agreement for all atomic
pair correlation functions compared to the path integral molecular dynamics

Namely, let $E\subset \R^n$ and $$J_{p,q}(\a,

violating completion time goals of the users by dynamically increasing or
decreasing individual VMs to maximize data locality and also to maximize the

inter-valley scattering, sample disorder reduces the edge conductance. However,
for weak scattering a metallic regime emerges with the diffusive conductance G

to the inter-valley scattering and L >> l_KK' is the edge length. We also take

incorporate the latest data from XENON100 on the spin independent direct

also imposes that the observed thermal relic density is obtained. We also study
models with a low abundance that can more easily evade the direct detection
rates. We study the impact of the flavour and Dark Matter observables on the

rules selecting and weighting in the construction of fuzzy rule based

T-norms. Consequently, these changes in calculation results in altering the
overall accuracy of rule based classification systems. Experimental results
obtained on some well-known data sets show that the best performance is

time scales. To understand the physics of such hierarchy, here Brownian motion
of a particle moving through a fluctuating medium with slowly varying
temperature is studied as an analytically tractable example, and a kinetic
theory is formulated for describing the states of the particle. What is
peculiar here is that the (inverse) temperature is treated as a dynamical
variable. Dynamical hierarchy is introduced in conformity with the adiabatic
scheme. Then, a new analytical method is developed to show how the
Fokker-Planck equation admits as a stationary solution the Maxwellian
distribution modulated by the temperature fluctuations, the distribution of
which turns out to be determined by the drift term. A careful comment is also
made on so-called superstatistics.

communicate with each other using multihop wireless links without requiring any
fixed based-station infrastructure and centralized management. Each node in the
network acts as both a host and a router. In such scenario, designing of an
efficient, reliable and secure routing protocol has been a major challenging
issue over the last many years. Numerous schemes have been proposed for secure
routing protocols and most of the research work has so far focused on providing
security for routing using cryptography. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach to secure Ad hoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing protocol
from the insider attacks launched through active forging of its Route Reply
(RREP) control message. AODV routing protocol does not have any security
provision that makes it less reliable in publicly open ad hoc network. To deal
with the concerned security attacks, we have proposed AODV Security Extension
(AODVSEC) which enhances the scope of AODV for the security provision. We have
compared AODVSEC with AODV and Secure AODV (SAODV) in normal situation as well
as in presence of the three concerned attacks viz. Resource Consumption (RC)
attack, Route Disturb (RD) attack, Route Invasion (RI) attack and Blackhole
(BH) attack. To evaluate the performances, we have considered Packet Delivery
Fraction (PDF), Average End-to-End Delay (AED), Average Throughput (AT),
Normalized Routing Load (NRL) and Average Jitter and Accumulated Average

superconductors, we solve the linearized Eliashberg's equation on the
two-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the presence of the Rashba-type
spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) within the random phase approximation. In the
presence of the RSOC, three types of pairing symmetries appear in the phase
diagram with respect to the on-site Coulomb repulsion U and off-site one V.
Each of pairing symmetries is admixture of spin-singlet and -triplet ones. On
the basis of analytical study, it is found that the admixture of spin-singlet
and -triplet components depends on not only the predominant pairing symmetry
but also dispersion relation and pairing interaction.

In particular, we consider the quasi-two dimensional geometry, where a strong
trapping potential admits only zero-point motion in the trap direction, while
the atoms are more free to move in the transverse directions. We employ the
Bogoliubov treatment of the two-component system to identify both the
well-known long-wavelength IMT in addition to a roton-like IMT, where the
transition occurs at finite-wave number and is reminiscent of the roton
softening in the single component dipolar BEC. Additionally, we verify the
existence of the roton IMT in the fully trapped, finite systems by direct
numerical simulation of the two-component coupled non-local Gross-Pitaevskii

functions (parametrizations) defined on a closed interval. They can also be
defined as connected one-dimensional compact subsets of points. For simple
curves of finite lengths, parametrizations can be further required to be
injective or even length-normalized. All of these four approaches to curves are
classically equivalent. In this paper we investigate four different versions of
computable curves based on these four approaches. It turns out that they are
all different, and hence, we get four different classes of computable curves.
More interestingly, these four classes are even point-separable in the sense
that the sets of points covered by computable curves of different versions are
also different. However, if we consider only computable curves of computable
lengths, then all four versions of computable curves become equivalent. This
shows that the definition of computable curves is robust, at least for those of
computable lengths. In addition, we show that the class of computable curves of
computable lengths is point-separable from the other four classes of computable
curves.

function (Floquet-NEGF) describing open quantum systems periodically driven by
an external field of arbitrary strength of frequency. By adopting the
reduced-zone scheme, we obtain expressions rendering conserved charge currents
for any given maximum number of photons, distinguishable from other existed
Floquet-NEGF-based expressions where, less feasible, infinite number of photons
needed to be taken into account to ensure the conservation. To justify our
derived formalism and to investigate spin-charge conversions by spin-orbit
coupling (SOC), we consider the spin-driven setups as reciprocal to the
electric-driven setups in S. Souma et. al., Phys. Rev. B 70, 195346 (2004) and
Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 106602 (2005). In our setups, pure spin currents are
driven by the magnetization dynamics of a precessing ferromagnetic (FM) island
and then are pumped into the adjacent two- or four-terminal mesoscopic
Aharonov-Casher (AC) ring of Rashba SOC where spin-charge conversions take
place. Our spin-driven results show reciprocal features that excellently agree
with the findings in the electric-driven setups mentioned above. We propose two
types of symmetry operations, under which the AC ring Hamiltonian is invariant,
to argue the relations of the pumped/converted currents in the leads within the
same or between different pumping configurations. The symmetry arguments are
independent of the ring width and the number of open channels in the leads,
terminals, and precessing FM islands, In particular, net pure in-plane spin
currents and pure spin currents can be generated in the leads for certain
setups of two terminals and two precessing FM islands with the current
magnitude and polarization direction tunable by the pumping configuration, gate
voltage covering the two-terminal AC ring in between the FM islands.

second is a new, fully second-order scheme that also respects the convex

the gradients of strictly convex, coercive functionals. Thus, both are uniquely
solvable regardless of the time and space step sizes. The schemes are solved by
efficient nonlinear multigrid methods. Numerical results are presented
demonstrating the accuracy, energy stability, efficiency, and practical utility
of the schemes. In particular, we show that our multigrid solvers enjoy
optimal, or nearly optimal complexity in the solution of the nonlinear schemes.
