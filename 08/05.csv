and platelets are preferentially found near blood vessel walls, while
erythrocytes are depleted from these regions. Here margination is investigated
using direct hydrodynamic simulations of a binary suspension of stiff (s) and
floppy (f) capsules, as well as a stochastic model that incorporates the key
particle transport mechanisms in suspensions -- wall-induced hydrodynamic
migration and shear-induced pair collisions. The stochastic model allows the
relative importance of these two mechanisms to be directly evaluated and
thereby indicates that margination, at least in the dilute case, is largely due
to the differential dynamics of homogeneous (e.g. s-s) and heterogeneous (s-f)
collisions

Tehran, Iran 2008",,,,"cs.OH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  In a global and technology oriented world the requirements that products and
services have to fulfill are increasing and are getting more complicated.
Research and development (R&D) is becoming increasingly important in creating
the knowledge that makes research and business more competitive. Companies are
obliged to produce more rapidly, more effectively and more efficiently. In
order to meet these requirements and to secure the viability of business
processes, services and products R&D teams need to access and retrieve
information from as many sources as possible. From the other perspective
virtual teams are important mechanisms for organizations seeking to leverage
scarce resources across geographic and other boundaries moreover; virtual
collaboration has become vital for most organizations. This is particularly
true in the context of designing new product and service innovation. Such
collaboration often involves a network of partners located around the world.
However at the R&D project level, dealing with such distributed teams
challenges both managers and specialists. In new product development, it is
necessary to put together the growing different capabilities and services with
the goal, through cooperation between suppliers and customers, service
providers and scientific institutions to achieve innovations of high quality.
In this paper based on comprehensive literature review of recent articles, at
the first step provides an primary definition and characterization of virtual
R&D team; next, the potential value created by virtual R&D teams for new
product development is explored and lastly along with a guide line for future
study, it is argued that the establishing of virtual R&D teams should be given
consideration in the management of R&D projects.

  Noise in Linear Multi-Agent Systems",,,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many applications of multi-agent systems (MAS), a set of leader agents
acts as a control input to the remaining follower agents. In this paper, we
introduce an analytical approach to selecting leader agents in order to
minimize the total mean-square error of the follower agent states from their
desired value in steady-state in the presence of noisy communication links. We
show that the problem of choosing leaders in order to minimize this error can
be solved using supermodular optimization techniques, leading to efficient
algorithms that are within a provable bound of the optimum. We formulate two
leader selection problems within our framework, namely the problem of choosing
a fixed number of leaders to minimize the error, as well as the problem of
choosing the minimum number of leaders to achieve a tolerated level of error.
We study both leader selection criteria for different scenarios, including MAS
with static topologies, topologies experiencing random link or node failures,
switching topologies, and topologies that vary arbitrarily in time due to node
mobility. In addition to providing provable bounds for all these cases,
simulation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other leader
selection methods, such as node degree-based and random selection methods, and
provides comparable performance to current state of the art algorithms.

the radio emission of inclined air showers in the Ultra-High Frequency band
(300 MHz - 3 GHz). The Fourier-spectrum of the radiation is shown to have a
sizable intensity well into the GHz frequency range. The emission is mainly due
to transverse currents induced by the geomagnetic field and to the excess
charge produced by the Askaryan effect. At these frequencies only a
significantly reduced volume of the shower around the axis contributes
coherently to the signal observed on the ground. The size of the coherently
emitting volume depends on frequency, shower geometry and observer position,
and is interpreted in terms of the relative time delays. At ground level, the
maximum emission at high frequencies is concentrated in an elliptical ring-like
region around the intersection of a Cherenkov cone with its vertex at shower
maximum and the ground. The frequency spectrum of inclined showers when
observed at positions that view shower maximum in the Cherenkov direction, is
shown to be in broad agreement with the pulses detected by the Antarctic
Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment, making the interpretation that
they are due to Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray atmospheric showers consistent
with our simulations. These results are also of great importance for
experiments aiming to detect molecular bremsstrahlung radiation in the GHz
range as they present an important background for its detection.

common envelope evolution. Instead, we assume that systems where the core of
the secondary AGB star is more massive than the WD remnant of the primary star
merge at the termination of the common envelope phase. We also use a simple
prescription to count systems that have strong interaction during the AGB
phase, but not during the earlier red giant branch (RGB) phase. That a very
simple population synthesis code that uses the basics of stellar evolution

find the sublimation temperature of 1130 +- 90 K and 1170 +- 60 K for silicates
and amorphous carbon respectively, both somewhat lower than expected from
laboratory measurements and vastly below temperatures inferred from the inner
edge of YSO disks. The fact that O-rich and C-rich dust types showed the same
sublimation temperature was surprising as well. For the most optically-thick
shells (tau > 2 at 2.2 microns), the temperature profile of the inner dust
shell is observed to change substantially, an effect we suggest could arise
when individual dust clumps become optically-thick at the highest mass-loss
rates.

simulations of the two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet in contact with a heat

at temperatures $T_1<T_c<T_2$, where $T_c$ is the Onsager critical temperature.
In this way one can observe a phase transition between an ordered phase
($T<T_c$) and a disordered one ($T>T_c$) by means of a single simulation. By
starting the simulations with fully disordered initial configurations with
magnetization $m\equiv 0$ corresponding to $T=\infty$, which are then suddenly
annealed to a preset thermal gradient, we study the short-time critical dynamic
behavior of the system. Also, by setting a small initial magnetization $m=m_0$,
we study the critical initial increase of the order parameter. Furthermore, by
starting the simulations from fully ordered configurations, which correspond to
the ground state at T=0 and are subsequently quenched to a preset gradient, we
study the critical relaxation dynamics of the system. Additionally, we perform
stationary measurements ($t\rightarrow\infty$) that are discussed in terms of
the standard finite-size scaling theory. We conclude that our numerical
simulation results of the Ising magnet in a thermal gradient, which are
rationalized in terms of both dynamic and standard scaling arguments, are fully

developed in the framework of Reduced MHD. A local analysis is performed taking
into account the dependence of a generic equilibrium profile on the outflow
coordinate. The plasmoid instability [Loureiro et al, Phys. Plasmas {\bf 14},
100703 (2007)] is recovered, i.e., current sheets are unstable to the formation
of a large-wave-number chain of plasmoids ($k_{\rm max}\Lsheet \sim S^{3/8}$,
where $k_{\rm max}$ is the wave-number of fastest growing mode, $S=\Lsheet
V_A/\eta$ is the Lundquist number, $\Lsheet$ is the length of the sheet, $V_A$
is the Alfv\'en speed and $\eta$ is the plasma resistivity), which grows
super-Alfv\'enically fast ($\gmax\tau_A\sim S^{1/4}$, where $\gmax$ is the
maximum growth rate, and $\tau_A=\Lsheet/V_A$). For typical background
profiles, the growth rate and the wave-number are found to {\it increase} in
the outflow direction. This is due to the presence of another mode, the
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability, which is triggered at the periphery of the
layer, where the outflow velocity exceeds the Alfv\'en speed associated with
the upstream magnetic field. The KH instability grows even faster than the
plasmoid instability, $\gmax \tau_A \sim k_{\rm max} \Lsheet\sim S^{1/2}$. The
effect of viscosity ($\nu$) on the plasmoid instability is also addressed. In
the limit of large magnetic Prandtl numbers, $Pm=\nu/\eta$, it is found that
$\gmax\sim S^{1/4}Pm^{-5/8}$ and $k_{\rm max} \Lsheet\sim S^{3/8}Pm^{-3/16}$,
leading to the prediction that the critical Lundquist number for plasmoid
instability in the $Pm\gg1$ regime is $\Scrit\sim 10^4Pm^{1/2}$. These results
are verified via direct numerical simulation of the linearized equations, using
a new, analytical 2D SP equilibrium solution.

released by applying an atomic frequency shift causing a revival of photon

method of parallel MRI makes use of an autocalibration scan (ACS) to determine
a set of synthesis coefficients to be used in the image reconstruction. For EPI
time series the ACS data is usually acquired once prior to the time series. In
this case the interleaved R-shot EPI trajectory, where R is the GRAPPA
reduction factor, offers advantages which we justify from a theoretical and
experimental perspective. Unfortunately, interleaved R-shot ACS can be
corrupted due to perturbations to the signal (such as direct and indirect
motion effects) occurring between the shots, and these perturbations may lead
to artifacts in GRAPPA-reconstructed images. Consequently we also present a
method of acquiring interleaved ACS data in a manner which can reduce the
effects of inter-shot signal perturbations. This method makes use of the phase
correction data, conveniently a part of many standard EPI sequences, to assess
the signal perturbations between the segments of R-shot EPI ACS scans. The
phase correction scans serve as navigator echoes, or more accurately a
perturbation-sensitive signal, to which a root-mean-square deviation
perturbation metric is applied for the determination of the best available
complete ACS data set among multiple complete sets of ACS data acquired prior
to the EPI time series. This best set (assumed to be that with the smallest
valued perturbation metric) is used in the GRAPPA autocalibration algorithm,
thereby permitting considerable improvement in both image quality and temporal
signal-to-noise ratio of the subsequent EPI time series at the expense of a
small increase in overall acquisition time.

dominated by cold HI emission (i.e., have velocity dispersions <6 km/s) are
found primarily beyond the optical radius of the host galaxy. The cold HI is
typically found in localized regions and is generally not coincident with the
very highest surface density peaks of the global HI distribution (which are

expertise, the human expert is still often able to emit preferences and rank
the agent demonstrations. Earlier work has presented an iterative
preference-based RL framework: expert preferences are exploited to learn an
approximate policy return, thus enabling the agent to achieve direct policy
search. Iteratively, the agent selects a new candidate policy and demonstrates
it; the expert ranks the new demonstration comparatively to the previous best
one; the expert's ranking feedback enables the agent to refine the approximate
policy return, and the process is iterated. In this paper, preference-based
reinforcement learning is combined with active ranking in order to decrease the
number of ranking queries to the expert needed to yield a satisfactory policy.
Experiments on the mountain car and the cancer treatment testbeds witness that
a couple of dozen rankings enable to learn a competent policy.

solution for assisting recommender systems. Even though the approach of using a
web-of-trust scheme for assisting the recommendation production is well
adopted, issues like the sparsity problem have not been explored adequately so
far with regard to this. In this work we are proposing and testing a scheme
that uses the existing ratings of users to calculate the hypothetical trust
that might exist between them. The purpose is to demonstrate how some basic
social networking when applied to an existing system can help in alleviating
problems of traditional recommender system schemes. Interestingly, such schemes
are also alleviating the cold start problem from which mainly new users are
suffering. In order to show how good the system is in that respect, we measure
the performance at various times as the system evolves and we also contrast the
solution with existing approaches. Finally, we present the results which
justify that such schemes undoubtedly work better than a system that makes no
use of trust at all.

derived in 2002, a lot of limit theorems for quantum walks with a localized

theory, there are four notions of independence (free, monotone, commuting, and
boolean independence) and quantum central limit theorems associated to each
independence have been investigated. The relation between quantum walks and
quantum probability theory is still unknown. As random walks are fundamental
models in the Kolmogorov probability theory, can the quantum walks play an
important role in quantum probability theory? To discuss this problem, we focus
on a discrete-time 2-state quantum walk with a non-localized initial state and
present a limit theorem. By using our limit theorem, we generate probability

accelerate electrons in the parallel to magnetic field direction. Driven
perpendicular electric field of IAWs also heats ions in the transverse
direction. Such numerical setup is relevant for solar flaring loops and earth

electric field is localised in the density inhomogeneity region and rotates in
the same direction and with the same angular frequency as the initially

experiments are not effective at teaching interference and diffraction. In
response, the author created an interactive computer program that simulates
interference and diffraction effects using the Finite Difference Time Domain
method. The software allows students to easily control, visualize, and
quantitatively measure the effects. Students collected data from simulations as
part of their laboratory exercise, and they performed well on a subsequent
quiz---showing promise for this approach.

  choices of scale factor","13 pages, 12 figures","Journal of Theoretical and Applied Physics 2012, 6:27","10.1186/2251-7235-6-27",,"physics.gen-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present study is aimed at investigating the validity of the generalized
second law (GSL) of thermodynamics in $f(\cal R)$ gravity. Choosing $f(\cal
R)=R+\xi R^{\mu}+\zeta R^{-\nu}$ [following Phys Rev D, 68, 123512 (2003)] we
have computed the time derivatives of total entropy for various choices of
scale factor pertaining to emergent, intermediate and logamediate scenarios of
the universe. We have taken into account the radii of hubble, apparent,
particle and event horizons while computing the time derivatives of entropy
under various situations being considered. After analyzing through the plots of
time derivative of total entropy against cosmic time it is observed that the
derivative always stays at positive level that indicate the validity of GSL of
thermodynamics in the $f(\cal R)$ gravity irrespective of the choices of scale
factor and enveloping horizon.

surface is proposed and investigated experimentally and theoretically - water
droplet could be driven by scale effect which is different from the traditional
methods. Gradient microstructured hydrophobic surface is fabricated in which
the area fraction is kept constant, but the scales of the micro-pillars are
monotonic changed. When additional water or horizontal vibration is applied,
the original water droplet could move unidirectionally to the direction from
the small scale to the large scale to decrease its total surface energy. A new
mechanism based on line tension model could be used to explain this phenomenon.
It is also found that dynamic contact angle decreases with increasing the scale
of the micro-pillars along the moving direction. These new findings will deepen
our understanding of the relationship between topology and wetting properties,
and could be very helpful to design liquid droplet transportation device in
microfluidic systems.
