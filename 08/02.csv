The complexity of the Spanish political-administrative system makes such a
study challenging, in view of the considerable degree of autonomy and
competences of the regional administrative bodies and local agencies with
respect to the central government, the former being more visible in the 17
regions of Spain. Nonetheless, the central government maintains a series of
legal instruments that allow a certain common framework of action to be
imposed, aside from what is put into effect through diverse programs aimed
precisely to develop common tools for the regions and municipalities of Spain.
  After an introduction that provides some necessary background, this study
describes the legislative framework in which Spain's electronic administrative
system has developed. The data included in the study refer to investment in
information and communication technologies (ICT) and the services offered by
the different Administrations on the internet; internet access by citizens,
homes, businesses, and employees, as well as the interactivity existing with
administrations by means of the internet; the origins and rise of various
political initiatives of the Central Government involving electronic
administration; and finally, the situation of civil service personnel, as
catalysts of the success of Information Society in the Public Administration
within Spain.

holes depends on the accretion rate. Broad iron emission lines originating from
the irradiation of cool matter can indicate that there is an inner disk below a
hot coronal flow.These emission lines have been detected in X-ray binaries.
Observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, XMM Newton and Suzaku have
confirmed the presence of these emission lines also in a large fraction of
Seyfert-1 active galactic nuclei (AGN). We investigate the accretion flow
geometry for which broad iron emission lines can arise in hard and soft
spectral state. We study an ADAF-type coronal flow, where the ions are
viscously heated and electrons receive their heat only by collisions from the
ions and are Compton cooled by photons from an underlying cool disk. For a
strong mass flow in the disk and the resulting strong Compton cooling only a
very weak coronal flow is possible. This limitation allows the formation of
ADAF-type coronae above weak inner disks in the hard state, but almost rules
them out in the soft state. The observed hard X-ray luminosity in the soft
state, of up to 10% or more of the total flux, indicates that there is a
heating process that directly accelerates the electrons. This might point to
the action of magnetic flares of disk magnetic fields reaching into the corona.
Such flares have also been proposed by observations of the spectra of X-ray
black hole binaries without a thermal cut-off around 200 keV.

sets strong constraint on the DM models to explain the line emission. 2) No

Applications that make many small accesses to the database create two

application performance is to convert part of the application into stored
procedures that are executed on the database server. Unfortunately, this
conversion is often difficult. In this paper we describe Pyxis, a system that
takes database-backed applications and automatically partitions their code into
two pieces, one of which is executed on the application server and the other on
the database server. Pyxis profiles the application and server loads,
statically analyzes the code's dependencies, and produces a partitioning that
minimizes the number of control transfers as well as the amount of data sent
during each transfer. Our experiments using TPC-C and TPC-W show that Pyxis is
able to generate partitions with up to 3x reduction in latency and 1.7x
improvement in throughput when compared to a traditional non-partitioned
implementation and has comparable performance to that of a custom stored

warping (DTW) distance between time series of size N and M is computed relying
on a dynamic programming approach which creates and fills an NxM grid to search
for an optimal warp path. Since this can be costly, various heuristics have
been proposed to cut away the potentially unproductive portions of the DTW
grid. In this paper, we argue that time series often carry structural features
that can be used for identifying locally relevant constraints to eliminate
redundant work. Relying on this observation, we propose salient feature based
sDTW algorithms which first identify robust salient features in the given time

boundaries for the warp path search. More specifically, we propose alternative
fixed core&adaptive width, adaptive core&fixed width, and adaptive
core&adaptive width strategies which enforce different constraints reflecting
the high level structural characteristics of the series in the data set.
Experiment results show that the proposed sDTW algorithms help achieve much

tools to efficiently work with data of this size. One problem many scientists
share is the analysis of the massive spatial models they build. For several
types of analysis they need to interactively follow the structures in the
spatial model, e.g., the arterial tree, neuron fibers, etc., and issue range
queries along the way. Each query takes long to execute, and the total time for
executing a sequence of queries significantly delays data analysis. Prefetching
the spatial data reduces the response time considerably, but known approaches
do not prefetch with high accuracy. We develop SCOUT, a structure-aware method
for prefetching data along interactive spatial query sequences. SCOUT uses an
approximate graph model of the structures involved in past queries and attempts
to identify what particular structure the user follows. Our experiments with
neuroscience data show that SCOUT prefetches with an accuracy from 71% to 92%,
which translates to a speedup of 4x-15x. SCOUT also improves the prefetching

analysis, cross-comparing the spatial boundaries of a huge amount of segmented
micro-anatomic objects demands extremely data- and compute-intensive
operations, requiring high throughput at an affordable cost. However, the
performance of spatial database systems has not been satisfactory since their
implementations of spatial operations cannot fully utilize the power of modern
parallel hardware. In this paper, we provide a customized software solution
that exploits GPUs and multi-core CPUs to accelerate spatial cross-comparison
in a cost-effective way. Our solution consists of an efficient GPU algorithm
and a pipelined system framework with task migration support. Extensive
experiments with real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
solution, which improves the performance of spatial cross-comparison by over 18
times compared with a parallelized spatial database approach.

  1555-1566 (2012)",,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to estimate resource consumption of SQL queries is crucial for a
number of tasks in a database system such as admission control, query
scheduling and costing during query optimization. Recent work has explored the
use of statistical techniques for resource estimation in place of the manually
constructed cost models used in query optimization. Such techniques, which
require as training data examples of resource usage in queries, offer the
promise of superior estimation accuracy since they can account for factors such
as hardware characteristics of the system or bias in cardinality estimates.
However, the proposed approaches lack robustness in that they do not generalize
well to queries that are different from the training examples, resulting in
significant estimation errors. Our approach aims to address this problem by
combining knowledge of database query processing with statistical models. We
model resource-usage at the level of individual operators, with different
models and features for each operator type, and explicitly model the asymptotic
behavior of each operator. This results in significantly better estimation
accuracy and the ability to estimate resource usage of arbitrary plans, even
when they are very different from the training instances. We validate our
approach using various large scale real-life and benchmark workloads on
Microsoft SQL Server.

show, that there is a dead angle \theta^*_d relative to \theta_h of similar

(around 1.5 degrees FWHM), and wide sky coverage (25% of the sky). The payload
will fly in a circumpolar long duration balloon mission during the polar night.
Using the Earth as a giant solar shield, the instrument will spin in azimuth,
observing a large fraction of the northern sky. The payload will host two
instruments. An array of coherent polarimeters using cryogenic HEMT amplifiers
will survey the sky at 43 and 90 GHz. An array of bolometric polarimeters,
using large throughput multi-mode bolometers and rotating Half Wave Plates

certain items has important implications in helping users search for desired
information. In this paper, we explore common analysis tasks and propose a dual

adopting different concrete measures for similarity and diversity in the

solving many of those problems and demonstrate, through comprehensive
experiments over real data, that our algorithms significantly out-perform the

at improving the transaction throughput as well as shortening the recovery time

large flash memory drive to store the entire database tables. This was possible
due to flash write optimization as well as disk access reduction obtained by
the FaCE caching methods. In addition, FaCE takes advantage of the
non-volatility of flash memory to fully support database recovery by extending
the scope of a persistent database to include the data pages stored in the
flash cache. We have implemented FaCE in the PostgreSQL open source database

it can represent. This paper first describes the quotient filter, which
supports the basic operations of the Bloom filter, achieving roughly comparable
performance in terms of space and time, but with better data locality.
Operations on the quotient filter require only a small number of contiguous
accesses. The quotient filter has other advantages over the Bloom filter: it
supports deletions, it can be dynamically resized, and two quotient filters can
be efficiently merged. The paper then gives two data structures, the buffered
quotient filter and the cascade filter, which exploit the quotient filter
advantages and thus serve as SSD-optimized alternatives to the Bloom filter.
The cascade filter has better asymptotic I/O performance than the buffered
quotient filter, but the buffered quotient filter outperforms the cascade
filter on small to medium data sets. Both data structures significantly
outperform recently-proposed SSD-optimized Bloom filter variants, such as the
elevator Bloom filter, buffered Bloom filter, and forest-structured Bloom

frequent itemsets over uncertain databases has attracted much attention. In
uncertain databases, the support of an itemset is a random variable instead of
a fixed occurrence counting of this itemset. Thus, unlike the corresponding
problem in deterministic databases where the frequent itemset has a unique
definition, the frequent itemset under uncertain environments has two different
definitions so far. The first definition, referred as the expected
support-based frequent itemset, employs the expectation of the support of an
itemset to measure whether this itemset is frequent. The second definition,
referred as the probabilistic frequent itemset, uses the probability of the
support of an itemset to measure its frequency. Thus, existing work on mining
frequent itemsets over uncertain databases is divided into two different groups
and no study is conducted to comprehensively compare the two different
definitions. In addition, since no uniform experimental platform exists,
current solutions for the same definition even generate inconsistent results.
In this paper, we firstly aim to clarify the relationship between the two
different definitions. Through extensive experiments, we verify that the two
definitions have a tight connection and can be unified together when the size
of data is large enough. Secondly, we provide baseline implementations of eight
existing representative algorithms and test their performances with uniform
measures fairly. Finally, according to the fair tests over many different

discuss some new findings.

chaotic for appropriate model parameters such as $N_B$, $c_o$ (coupling

held in practice at charity events or festivals. In a Chinese auction, multiple
players compete for several items by buying tickets, which can be used to win
the items. In front of each item there is a basket, and the players can bid by
placing tickets in the basket(s) corresponding to the item(s) they are trying
to win. After all the players have placed their tickets, a ticket is drawn at
random from each basket and the item is given to the owner of the winning
ticket. While a player is never guaranteed to win an item, they can improve
their chances of getting it by increasing the number of tickets for that item.
  In this paper we investigate the existence of pure Nash equilibria in both
the continuous and discrete settings. When the players have continuous budgets,
we show that a pure Nash equilibrium may not exist for asymmetric games when
some valuations are zero. In that case we prove that the auctioneer can
stabilize the game by placing his own ticket in each basket. On the other hand,
when all the valuations are strictly positive, a pure Nash equilibrium is
guaranteed to exist, and the equilibrium strategies are symmetric when both
valuations and budgets are symmetric. We also study Chinese auctions with
discrete budgets, for which we give both existence results and counterexamples.
While the literature on rent-seeking contests traditionally focuses on
continuous costly tickets, the discrete variant is very natural and more
closely models the version of the auction held in practice.

are dominated by nitrogen-rich ice. We use a statistical thermodynamic model to
investigate the composition of the successive multiple guest clathrates that
may have formed during the cooling of the primordial nebula from the most
abundant volatiles present in the gas phase. These clathrates agglomerated with
the other ices (pure condensates or stoichiometric hydrates) and formed the
building blocks of comets. We report that molecular nitrogen is a poor
clathrate former, when we consider a plausible gas phase composition of the
primordial nebula. This implies that its trapping into cometesimals requires a
low disk temperature ($\sim$20 K) in order to allow the formation of its pure
condensate. We find that it is possible to explain the lack of molecular
nitrogen in comets as a consequence of their postformation internal heating
engendered by the decay of short-lived radiogenic nuclides. This scenario is
found consistent with the presence of nitrogen-rich ice covers on Pluto and
Triton. Our model predicts that comets should present xenon-to-water and
krypton-to-water ratios close to solar xenon-to-oxygen and krypton-to-oxygen
ratios, respectively. In contrast, the argon-to-water ratio is predicted to be
depleted by a factor of $\sim$300 in comets compared to solar argon-to-oxygen,
as a consequence of poor trapping efficiency and radiogenic heating.

dwarf. Combined with our previous spectrum of the primary alone (Paper I), the
new observations yield the spectrum of the secondary alone. We investigate,
through a differential analysis of the two binary components, whether cool
surface spots are responsible for suppressing the temperature of the primary.
In Paper I, we found a significant discrepancy between the empirical surface
gravity of the primary and that inferred via fine analysis of its spectrum.
Here we find precisely the same discrepancy in surface gravity, both
qualitatively and quantitatively. While this may again be ascribed to either
cool spots or model opacity errors, it implies that cool spots cannot be
responsible for preferentially lowering the temperature of the primary: if they
were, spot effects on the primary spectrum should be preferentially larger, and
they are not. The Teff we infer for the primary and secondary, from the
TiO-epsilon bands alone, show the same reversal, in the same ratio, as is
empirically observed, bolstering the validity of our analysis. In turn, this
implies that if suppression of convection by magnetic fields on the primary is
the fundamental cause of the Teff reversal, then it cannot be a local
suppression yielding spots mainly on the primary (though both components may be
equally spotted), but a global suppression in the interior of the primary. We
briefly discuss current theories of how this might work.

the mean collision velocity has been considered, neglecting that a small but
possibly important fraction of the collisions will occur at both much lower and
higher velocities. We study the effect of the probability distribution of
impact velocities on the collisional dust growth barriers. Assuming a
Maxwellian velocity distribution for colliding particles to determine the
fraction of sticking, bouncing, and fragmentation, we implement this in a
dust-size evolution code. We also calculate the probability of growing through
the barriers and the growth timescale in these regimes. We find that the
collisional growth barriers are not as sharp as previously thought. With the
existence of low-velocity collisions, a small fraction of the particles manage
to grow to masses orders of magnitude above the main population. A particle
velocity distribution softens the fragmentation barrier and removes the
bouncing barrier. It broadens the size distribution in a natural way, allowing
the largest particles to become the first seeds that initiate sweep-up growth
towards planetesimal sizes.

energetic physical processes in the universe. It is known that core-collapse
SNe arise from the gravitational collapse and subsequent explosion of massive
stars (the progen- itors of nearby core-collapse SNe have been imaged and
unambiguously identified). It is also believed that the progenitors of
long-duration GRBs (L-GRBs) are massive stars, mainly due to the occurrence and
detection of very energetic core-collapse su- pernovae that happen both
temporally and spatially coincident with most L-GRBs. However many outstanding
questions regarding the nature of these events exist: How massive are the
progenitors? What evolutionary stage are they at when they explode? Do they
exist as single stars or in binary systems (or both, and to what fractions)?
  The work presented in this thesis attempts to further our understanding at
the types of progenitors that give rise to long-duration GRB supernovae
(GRB-SNe). This work is based on optical photometry obtained for three GRB-SNe
events: GRB 060729, GRB 090618 and XRF 100316D (an X-Ray Flash is similar to a
L-GRB, but has a lower peak energy). For GRB 060729 and GRB 090618 we model the
optical light curves and account for light coming from three sources: the host
galaxy, the afterglow and the supernova. When we remove the host flux, and
model the afterglow, the re- maining flux resembles that of a SN, both in the
shape of the light curve and the shape of the spectral energy distribution.

being scheduled, we are interested in minimizing the total time during which
the machine is active. We present a linear time algorithm for the case where
jobs are unit length and each Ti is a single interval. For general Ti, we show
that the problem is NP-complete even for B = 3. However when B = 2, we show
that it can be efficiently solved. In addition, we consider a version of the

also to handle non-unit length jobs. This yields an O(sqrt(L)m) time algorithm
to solve the preemptive scheduling problem for B = 2, where L is the sum of the
job lengths. We also show that for B = 2 and unit length jobs, the optimal

telescope with a spectral resolving power of R 3500 for a 0.7"" slit (2.9
pixels). The detector is a substrate-removed 2K x 2K HAWAII 2-RG HgCdTe array
from Teledyne Imaging Sensors with a cut-off wavelength of 2.5 {\mu}m and an
operational temperature of 77K. Spectroscopy of faint objects sets the
requirement for low dark current and low noise. MOSFIRE is also an infrared
camera with a 6.9' field of view projected onto the detector with 0.18"" pixel
sampling. Broad-band imaging drives the requirement for 32-channel readout and
MOSFIREs fast camera optics implies the need for a very flat detector. In this
paper we report the final performance of the detector selected for MOSFIRE. The
array is operated using the SIDECAR ASIC chip inside the MOSFIRE dewar and v2.3
of the HxRG software. Dark current plus instrument background is measured at
<0.008 e- s-1 pixel-1 on average. Multiple Correlated Double Sampling (MCDS)
and Up-The-Ramp (UTR) sampling are both available. A read noise of <5e- rms is
achieved with MCDS 16 and the lowest noise of 3e- rms occurs for 64 samples.
Charge persistence depends on exposure level and shows a large gradient across
this detector. However, the decay time constant is always \sim 660 seconds.
Linearity and stability are also discussed.

the ANIR near-infrared camera on the mini-TAO 1m telescope. The image enables
us to derive accurate star formation rates within the galaxy directly. The
total star formation rate, 22.2 M_sun/yr, was found to be much higher than
previous estimates. Ages of individual star forming blobs estimated from
equivalent widths indicate that most star forming regions are ~7 Myr old,
except for a giant HII region at the bridge which is much younger. Comparison
between star formation rates and molecular gas masses for the regions with the
same age exhibits a surprisingly tight correlation, a slope of unity, and star
formation efficiencies comparable to those of starburst galaxies. These results
suggest that Taffy I has just evolved into a starburst system after the
collision, and the star forming sites are at a similar stage in their evolution
from natal molecular clouds except for the bridge region. The tight
Schmidt-Kennicutt law supports the scenario that dispersion in the star
formation law is in large part due to differences in evolutionary stage of star
forming regions.

particles jump at rate 2d\kappa, split into two at rate \xi\vee 0, and die at
rate (-\xi)\vee 0. Our goal is to prove a number of basic properties of the
solution u under assumptions on $\xi$ that are as weak as possible. Throughout
the paper we assume that $\xi$ is stationary and ergodic under translations in
space and time, is not constant and satisfies \E(|\xi(0,0)|)<\infty, where \E
denotes expectation w.r.t. \xi. Under a mild assumption on the tails of the
distribution of \xi, we show that the solution to the parabolic Anderson
equation exists and is unique for all \kappa\in [0,\infty). Our main object of
interest is the quenched Lyapunov exponent
\lambda_0(\kappa)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{t}\log u(0,t). Under certain weak
space-time mixing conditions on \xi, we show the following properties:
(1)\lambda_0(\kappa) does not depend on the initial condition u_0;
(2)\lambda_0(\kappa)<\infty for all \kappa\in [0,\infty); (3)\kappa \mapsto
\lambda_0(\kappa) is continuous on [0,\infty) but not Lipschitz at 0. We
further conjecture:
(4)\lim_{\kappa\to\infty}[\lambda_p(\kappa)-\lambda_0(\kappa)]=0 for all
p\in\N, where \lambda_p
(\kappa)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{pt}\log\E([u(0,t)]^p) is the p-th annealed
Lyapunov exponent. Finally, we prove that our weak space-time mixing conditions
on \xi are satisfied for several classes of interacting particle systems.

find that the \Sigma distribution is degenerate, in the sense that many
different cluster morphologies (smooth or substructured) produce similar
cumulative distributions. However, when used in tandem with a measure of
structure, such as the Q-parameter, the current spatial and dynamical state of
a star cluster can be inferred. The effect of cluster dynamics on the \Sigma
distribution and the Q-parameter is investigated using N-body simulations and
we find that, depending on the assumed initial conditions, the \Sigma
distribution can rapidly evolve from high to low densities in less than 5Myr.
This suggests that the \Sigma distribution can only be used to assess the
current density of a star forming region, and provides little information on
its initial density. However, if the \Sigma distribution is used together with
the Q-parameter, then information on the amount of substructure can be used as
a proxy to infer the amount of dynamical evolution that has taken place.
Substructure is erased quickly through dynamics, which can disrupt binary star
systems and planets, as well as facilitate dynamical mass segregation.
Therefore, dynamical processing in young star forming regions could still be
significant, even without currently observed high densities.

potential are carried out using the code NBODY6. Based on these simulations a
new relationship between scale size and galactocentric distance is derived: the
scale size of star clusters is proportional to the hyperbolic tangent of the
galactocentric distance. The half-mass radius of star clusters increases
systematically with galactocentric distance but levels off when star clusters
orbit the galaxy beyond ~40 kpc. These simulations show that the half-mass
radius of individual star clusters varies significantly as they evolve over a
Hubble time, more so for clusters with shorter relaxation times, and remains
constant through several relaxation times only in certain situations when
expansion driven by the internal dynamics of the star cluster and the influence
of the host galaxy tidal field balance each other. Indeed, the radius of a star
cluster evolving within the inner 20 kpc of a realistic galactic gravitational
potential is severely truncated by tidal interactions and does not remain
constant over a Hubble time. Furthermore, the half-mass radius of star clusters
measured with present day observations bears no memory of the original cluster
size. Stellar evolution and tidal stripping are the two competing physical
mechanisms that determine the present day size of globular clusters. These
simulations also show that extended star clusters can form at large
galactocentric distances while remaining fully bound to the host galaxy. There
is thus no need to invoke accretion from an external galaxy to explain the
presence of extended clusters at large galactocentric distances in a Milky
Way-type galaxy.

redshift, we selected the HST band that most closely samples a common
rest-frame wavelength so as to minimize systematics from color gradients in
galaxies. At fixed n_c, galaxies grow in stellar mass by a factor of ~3 from
z~3 to z~0. The size evolution is complex: galaxies appear roughly constant in
size from z~3 to z~2 and then grow rapidly to lower redshifts. The evolution in
the surface mass density profiles indicates that most of the mass at r<2 kpc
was in place by z~2, and that most of the new mass growth occurred at larger
radii. This inside-out mass growth is therefore responsible for the larger
sizes and higher Sersic indices of the descendants toward low redshift. At z<2,
the effective radius evolves with the stellar mass as r_e M^{2.0}, consistent
with scenarios that find dissipationless minor mergers to be a key driver of
size evolution. The progenitors at z~3 were likely star-forming disks with
r_e~2 kpc, based on their low Sersic index of n~1, low median axis ratio of
b/a~0.52, and typical location in the star-forming region of the U-V versus V-J
diagram. By z~1.5, many of these star-forming disks disappeared, giving rise to
compact quiescent galaxies. Toward lower redshifts, these galaxies continued to
assemble mass at larger radii and became the local ellipticals that dominate
the high mass end of the mass function at the present epoch.

1 Mpc and two r200 cuts, one based on the velocity dispersion of the system and
the other on the X-ray emission. We find that an X-ray based r200 results in
less scatter in scaling relations and less dynamical complexity as evidenced by
results of the Anderson-Darling and Dressler-Schectman tests, indicating that
this radius tends to isolate the virialized part of the system. The constant
and velocity dispersion based cuts can overestimate membership and can work to
inflate velocity dispersion and dynamical and stellar mass. We find Lx-sigma

not dissimilar. The mean fraction of mass found in stars for our systems is
approximately 0.014 with a logarithmic standard deviation of 0.398 dex. We also
define and investigate a sample of groups which are X-ray underluminous given
the total group stellar mass. For these systems the fraction of stellar mass
contributed by the most massive galaxy is typically lower than that found for

stirred by in-falling galaxies, a process that can be studied in detail with
cosmological hydro- dynamical simulations. However, different numerical methods
yield discrepant predic- tions for crucial hydrodynamical processes, leading
for example to different entropy profiles in clusters of galaxies. In
particular, the widely used Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH)
scheme is suspected to strongly damp fluid instabili- ties and turbulence,
which are both crucial to establish the thermodynamic structure of clusters. In
this study, we test to which extent our recently developed Voronoi particle
hydrodynamics (VPH) scheme yields different results for the stripping of gas
out of infalling galaxies, and for the bulk gas properties of cluster. We
consider both the evolution of isolated galaxy models that are exposed to a
stream of intra cluster medium or are dropped into cluster models, as well as
non-radiative cosmological sim- ulations of cluster formation. We also compare
our particle-based method with results obtained with a fundamentally different
discretisation approach as implemented in the moving-mesh code AREPO. We find
that VPH leads to noticeably faster stripping of gas out of galaxies than SPH,
in better agreement with the mesh-code than with SPH. We show that despite the
fact that VPH in its present form is not as accurate as the moving mesh code in
our investigated cases, its improved accuracy of gradient estimates makes VPH
an attractive alternative to SPH.

acquiring sparse signals. The bulk of the CS literature has focused on the case
where the acquired signal has a sparse or compressible representation in an
orthonormal basis. In practice, however, there are many signals that cannot be
sparsely represented or approximated using an orthonormal basis, but that do
have sparse representations in a redundant dictionary. Standard results in CS
can sometimes be extended to handle this case provided that the dictionary is
sufficiently incoherent or well-conditioned, but these approaches fail to
address the case of a truly redundant or overcomplete dictionary. In this paper
we describe a variant of the iterative recovery algorithm CoSaMP for this more
challenging setting. We utilize the D-RIP, a condition on the sensing matrix
analogous to the well-known restricted isometry property. In contrast to prior
work, the method and analysis are ""signal-focused""; that is, they are oriented
around recovering the signal rather than its dictionary coefficients. Under the
assumption that we have a near-optimal scheme for projecting vectors in signal
space onto the model family of candidate sparse signals, we provide provable
recovery guarantees. Developing a practical algorithm that can provably compute
the required near-optimal projections remains a significant open problem, but
we include simulation results using various heuristics that empirically exhibit
superior performance to traditional recovery algorithms.

causal models may be written and tested when theories suggest spillover or
other network-based interference among experimental units. We show that the ""no

questions about interference. We offer researchers the ability to model
theories about how treatment given to some units may come to influence outcomes
for other units. We further show how to test hypotheses about these causal
effects, and we provide tools to enable researchers to assess the operating
characteristics of their tests given their own models, designs, test

here is particularly applicable to social networks, but may be usefully
deployed whenever a researcher wonders about interference between units.
Interference between units need not be an untestable assumption; instead,
interference is an opportunity to ask meaningful questions about theoretically

weak SOC regime, as expected, our theory reproduces all previous
zero-temperature results, most of which have focused on impurity-scattering

experiments have observed the spin-helix mode with a large spin-lifetime whose

  Propagation Network",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Adaptive routing algorithm has been employed in multichip interconnection
networks in order to improve network performance. Does a algorithm use local or
global network state? This is the key question in adaptive routing. In many
traffic patterns, the ignorance of global network state, leading to routing
selection based only on local congestion information, tends to violate global
load balance. To attack the load balance issue in adapting routing, some global
adaptive routing algorithms introduce a congestion propagation network to
obtain global network status information, such as Regional Congestion Awareness
(RCA) and Destination Based Adaptive Routing (DBAR).
  However, the congestion propagation network leads to additional power and
area consumption which cannot be ignored. From another view, if we just
increase the bandwidth between neighbor nodes with the wires used to build the
congestion propagation network, the network performance could be improved as
well. In this paper, we propose a global adaptive routing algorithm without
employing the additional congestion propagation network. Our algorithm obtains
the global network state in a novel way, and can offer significant improvement
than the base-line local adaptive routing algorithm (xy-adaptive algorithm
which selects routing based on local congestion information in each hop) for
both medium and high injection rates.
  In wormhole flow control, all the routing information (flit id, source node
id, destination node id, vc id and address) is contained in head flit, and data
is carried in body flits. As a result, there are always many free bits in the
head flit, especially when the bandwidth is 128-bits which is normal in
interconnection network design. Then, we can use these free bits in the head
flit to propagate global congestion information but not increase the number of
flits.

found that the coupling between stress gradient and polarization, or
flexoelectricity, has significant effect on ferroelectric properties of
epitaxial thin films, such as polarization, free energy profile and hysteresis
loop. However, this effect can be completely eliminated by applying an
optimized external, uniform electric field. The role of such uniform electric
field is shown to be the same as that of an ideal gradient electric field which
can suppress the flexoelectricty effect completely based on the present theory.
Since the uniform electric field is more convenient to apply and control than

effect induced by stress gradient in epitaxial thin films and enhance the

Apparently, a portion of the particles from these components may penetrate into
the Milky Way and make an extragalactic contribution to the total dark matter

  We find that the particles of the diffuse component of the Local Group are
apt to contribute $\sim 12%$ to the total dark matter density near the Earth.
The particles of the extragalactic dark matter stand out because of their high
speed ($\sim 600$ {km/s}), i.e. they are much faster than the galactic dark
matter. In addition, their speed distribution is very narrow ($\sim 20$
{km/s}). The particles have isotropic velocity distribution (perhaps, in
contrast to the galactic dark matter). The extragalactic dark matter should
give a significant contribution to the direct detection signal. If the detector
is sensitive only to the fast particles ($v<450$ {km/s}), the signal may even
dominate.
  The density of other possible types of the extragalactic dark matter (for
instance, of the diffuse component of the Virgo Supercluster) should be
relatively small and comparable with the average dark matter density of the
Universe. However, these particles can generate anomaly high energy collisions

True-MCSA, a framework for truthful double multi-channel spectrum auctions.
True-MCSA takes as input any reusability-driven spectrum allocation algorithm,
introduces novel virtual buyer group (VBG) splitting and bidding algorithms,
and applies a winner determination and pricing mechanism to achieve
truthfulness and other economic properties while improving spectrum utilization
and successfully dealing with multi-channel requests from both buyers and
sellers. Our results show that the auction efficiency is impacted by the
economic factors with efficiency degradations within 30%, under different
experimental settings. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that we
can improve the auction efficiency by choosing a proper bidding algorithm and
using a base bid. True-MCSA makes an important contribution on enabling
spectrum reuse to improve auction efficiency in multi-channel cases.

invariant differential operators for non-compact semisimple Lie groups. Our
starting points is the class of algebras, which we call 'conformal Lie
algebras' (CLA), which have very similar properties to the conformal algebras
of Minkowski space-time, though our aim is to go beyond this class in a natural
way. For this we introduce the new notion of {\it parabolic relation} between
two non-compact semisimple Lie algebras g and g' that have the same
complexification and possess maximal parabolic subalgebras with the same
complexification. Thus, we consider the exceptional algebra E_{7(7)} which is
parabolically related to the CLA E_{7(-25)}, the parabolic subalgebras
including E_{6(6)} and E_{6(-6)} . Other interesting examples are the
orthogonal algebras so(p,q) all of which are parabolically related to the
conformal algebra so(n,2) with p+q=n+2, the parabolic subalgebras including the
Lorentz subalgebra so(n-1,1) and its analogs so(p-1,q-1). We consider also
E_{6(6)} and E_{6(2)} which are parabolically related to the hermitian
symmetric case E_{6(-14)}, the parabolic subalgebras including real forms of
sl(6). We also give a formula for the number of representations in the main
multiplets valid for CLAs and all algebras that are parabolically related to
them. In all considered cases we give the main multiplets of indecomposable
elementary representations including the necessary data for all relevant
invariant differential operators. In the case of so(p,q) we give also the
reduced multiplets. We should stress that the multiplets are given in the most
economic way in pairs of {\it shadow fields}. Furthermore we should stress that
the classification of all invariant differential operators includes as special
cases all possible {\it conservation laws} and {\it conserved currents},
unitary or not.

However, until now all of these new properties have been studied extensively
based on the interfaces which involve a polar LaAlO$_3$ layer. To investigate
the role of the A and B cationic sites of the ABO$_3$ polar layer, here we
study various combinations of polar/nonpolar oxide (NdAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$,
PrAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ and NdGaO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$) interfaces which are similar in

the electronic reconstruction is the driving mechanism for the creation of the
2DEG at these oxide interfaces. Furthermore, the electrical properties of these

extremely vulnerable to various attacks. Since MFs are transmitted without
encryption, attackers can forge them easily. Such attacks can be detected in
cooperative environment such as Wireless Intrusion Detection System (WIDS).
However, in non-cooperative environment it is difficult for a single station to
identify these spoofing attacks using Received Signal Strength (RSS)-based
detection, due to the strong correlation of RSS to both the transmission power
(Txpower) and the location of the sender.
  By exploiting some unique characteristics (i.e., rapid spatial decorrelation,
independence of Txpower, and much richer dimensions) of the Channel State
Information (CSI), a standard feature in 802.11n Specification, we design a
prototype, called CSITE, to authenticate the Wi-Fi management frames by a

off-the-shelf hardware, achieves precise spoofing detection without

designed to address the challenges caused by user mobility and channel

of our design and conduct extensive evaluations in various scenarios. Our test
results show that our design significantly outperforms the RSS-based method in
terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency: we observe about 8 times
improvement by CSITE over RSS-based method on the falsely accepted attacking

mainly by the shock accompanying the propagation of the clouds outwards. The
infrared line ratios are emitted from clouds ejected from a starburst which
photoionises the gas by the black-body radiation flux corresponding to a
stellar colour temperature of about 50,000 K. Both the flux from the AGN and
the ionization parameters are low. The most characteristic physical parameters
are the relatively high shock velocities (>400 km/s) and low preshock densities
(about 40-60 cm-3) of the gas. The C/H, N/H, O/H relative abundances are higher
than solar by a factor lower or about 1.5. We suggest that those high relative
abundances indicate trapping of H into H2 molecules rather than high
metallicities. Adopting an initial grain radius of 1 micron, the dust
temperatures calculated in the clouds reached by the power-law radiation flux
and by the black-body radiation flux are 81 K and 68 K, respectively.

renormalized version of the adiabatic local density (ALDA) exchange-correlation

condensates (BECs) has been recently one of the most important topics in low
temperature physics. In these systems, a macroscopic wave function appears
because of Bose-Einstein condensation, which creates quantized vortices.
Turbulence consisting of quantized vortices is called quantum turbulence (QT).
The study of quantized vortices and QT has increased in intensity for two
reasons. The first is that recent studies of QT are considerably advanced over
older studies, which were chiefly limited to thermal counterflow in 4He, which
has no analogue with classical traditional turbulence, whereas new studies on
QT are focused on a comparison between QT and classical turbulence. The second
reason is the realization of atomic BECs in 1995, for which modern optical
techniques enable the direct control and visualization of the condensate and
can even change the interaction; such direct control is impossible in other
quantum condensates like superfluid helium and superconductors. Our group has
made many important theoretical and numerical contributions to the field of
quantum hydrodynamics of both superfluid helium and atomic BECs. In this
article, we review some of the important topics in detail. The topics of
quantum hydrodynamics are diverse, so we have not attempted to cover all these
topics in this article. We also ensure that the scope of this article does not

understand them, it is essential to identify all relevant parameters which
shift the energy balance between spin states, and determine their trends. We
find that \Delta, the eg-t2g crystal-field splitting, increases by ~250 meV
when increasing pressure to 8 GPa and by about 150 meV when cooling from 1000K
to 5K. It changes, however, by less than 100 meV when La is substituted with
another rare earth. Also the Hund's rule coupling J_avg is about the same in
systems with very different spin-state transition temperature, like LaCoO3 and
EuCoO3. Consequently, in addition to \Delta and J_avg, the Coulomb-exchange
anisotropy \Delta J_ avg and the super-exchange energy-gain \Delta E_SE play a
crucial role, and are comparable with spin-state dependent relaxation effects
due to covalency. We show that in the LnCoO3 series, with Ln=Y or a rare earth

Ln^{3+} ionic radius decreases. We give a simple model to describe spin-state
transitions and show that, at low temperature, the formation of isolated

following an initial bunch offset are important phenomena in synchrotrons and
storage rings, and are widely used for beam and lattice measurements.
Incoherent shifts of the particles betatron frequency and of the synchrotron
frequency modify the transverse spectrum and the bunch decoherence. In this
study we analyze the effects of transverse space charge and of the rf
nonlinearity on the decoherence signals. The transverse bunch decoherence and
the resulting coherent spectra are measured in the SIS18 synchrotron at GSI
Darmstadt for different bunch parameters. Particle tracking simulations
together with an analytical model are used to describe the modifications in the
decoherence signals and in the coherent spectra due to space charge and the rf
bucket nonlinearity.

in astrophysical phenomena in the light of recent progress in observations. The
mechanism of deconfinement is not well understood, but the thermodynamical
aspects of the hadron-quark (HQ) phase transition have been extensively studied
in recent years. Then the mixed phase of hadron and quark matter becomes
important; the proper treatment is needed to describe the HQ phase transition
and derive the equation of state (EOS) for the HQ matter, based on the Gibbs
conditions for phase equilibrium. We here adopt a EOS based on the
baryon-baryon interactions including hyperons for the hadron phase, while we
use rather simple EOS within the MIT bag model in the quark phase. For quark
matter we further try to improve the previous EOS by considering other
effective models of QCD. One of the interesting consequences may be the
appearance of the inhomogeneous structures called ""pasta"", which are brought
about by the surface and the Coulomb interaction effects. We present here a
comprehensive review of our recent works about the HQ phase transition in
various astrophysical situations: cold catalyzed matter, hot matter and
neutrino-trapped matter. We show how the pasta structure becomes unstable by
the charge screening of the Coulomb interaction, thermal effect or the neutrino
trapping effect. Such inhomogeneous structure may affect astrophysical
phenomena through its elasticity or thermal properties. Here we also discuss
some implications on supernova explosion, gravitational wave and cooling of
compact stars.

isotropic energy $E_{\rm iso}$ for 13 Short Gamma Ray Burst (SGRB) candidates

determined spectral parameters. A SGRB candidate is regarded as a misguided
SGRB if it is located in the 3-$\sigma_{\rm int}$ dispersion region from the
best-fit function of the $E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation for Long GRBs
(LGRBs) while the others are regarded as secure SGRBs possibly from compact
star mergers. Using 8 secure SGRBs out of 13 SGRB candidates, we tested whether
$E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ and $E_{\rm p}$--$L_{\rm p}$ correlations exist for
SGRBs. We found that $E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation for SGRBs($E_{\rm
iso} =10^{51.42 \pm 0.15}{\rm erg s^{-1}} ({E_{\rm p}}/{\rm 774.5 keV})^{1.58

probability $p=1.5\times10^{-3}$. We found also that the $E_{\rm p}$--$L_{\rm

correlations for SGRBs are dimmer than those of LGRBs for the same $E_{\rm p}$
by factors $\sim$100 ($E_{\rm p}$--$E_{\rm iso}$) and $\sim$ 5($E_{\rm
p}$--$L_{\rm p}$). Applying the tighter $E_{\rm p}$--$L_{\rm p}$ correlation
for SGRBs to 71 bright BATSE SGRBs, we found that pseudo redshift $z$ ranges
from 0.097 to 2.258 with the mean $<z>$ of 1.05. The redshifts of SGRBs
apparently cluster at lower redshift than those of LGRBs ($<z>\sim 2.2 $),
which supports the merger scenario of SGRBs.

distance. In contrast to the naive exhaustive search which entails large-scale
linear programs, we show that the computational burden can be cut down
significantly by a simple two-stage algorithm: (1) projecting the query and
data-base subspaces into lower-dimensional space by random Cauchy matrix, and
solving small-scale distance evaluations (linear programs) in the projection
space to locate candidate nearest; (2) with few candidates upon independent
repetition of (1), getting back to the high-dimensional space and performing
exhaustive search. To preserve the identity of the nearest subspace with
nontrivial probability, the projection dimension typically is low-order
polynomial of the subspace dimension multiplied by logarithm of number of the
subspaces (Theorem 2.1). The reduced dimensionality and hence complexity
renders the proposed algorithm particularly relevant to vision application such
as robust face and object instance recognition that we investigate empirically.

Both probes showed a signal in the chromosome spreads of the restorer line

monosomic (2n=2x=20+1R) or disomic (2n=2x=20+2R) addition lines with one or two
copies of a single alien chromosome region originating from radish. In the

the radish chromosome arms showing that the fertility restorer gene Rfk1 was
located in this additional radish chromosome. Detected disomic addition lines
were found to be unstable for turnip rape hybrid production. Using the BAC-FISH
analysis, weak signals were sometimes visible in two chromosomes of turnip rape

verified with BLAST analysis. In the future this homologous area in A genome

  mean payoff and perfect information","34pages",,,,"math.OC cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider zero-sum stochastic games with finite state and action spaces,
perfect information, mean payoff criteria, without any irreducibility
assumption on the Markov chains associated to strategies (multichain games).
The value of such a game can be characterized by a system of nonlinear
equations, involving the mean payoff vector and an auxiliary vector (relative
value or bias). We develop here a policy iteration algorithm for zero-sum
stochastic games with mean payoff, following an idea of two of the authors
(Cochet-Terrasson and Gaubert, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2006). The
algorithm relies on a notion of nonlinear spectral projection (Akian and
Gaubert, Nonlinear Analysis TMA, 2003), which is analogous to the notion of
reduction of super-harmonic functions in linear potential theory. To avoid
cycling, at each degenerate iteration (in which the mean payoff vector is not
improved), the new relative value is obtained by reducing the earlier one. We
show that the sequence of values and relative values satisfies a
lexicographical monotonicity property, which implies that the algorithm does
terminate. We illustrate the algorithm by a mean-payoff version of Richman
games (stochastic tug-of-war or discrete infinity Laplacian type equation), in
which degenerate iterations are frequent. We report numerical experiments on
large scale instances, arising from the latter games, as well as from monotone
discretizations of a mean-payoff pursuit-evasion deterministic differential
game.

resonance scattering where interference between the input photons and those
scattered by the resonantly coupled dipole transition result in a reflectivity
of zero. The contrast between this and the unit reflectivity when the cavity is
empty allow us to perform a non demolition measurement of the spin and to non
deterministically generate entanglement between photons and spins. The chief
advantage of working in the regime of resonance scattering is that the required
cavity quality factors are orders of magnitude lower than is required for
strong coupling, or Purcell enhancement. This makes engineering a suitable
cavity much easier particularly in materials such as diamond where etching high

quantum conditions on the wave-function entails a kind of selection rule. As an
example, the minisuperspace model ensuing from a reduction of the Einstein -
Hilbert action by considering static, spherically symmetric configurations and
r as the independent dynamical variable, is canonically quantized. The
conditional symmetries of this reduced action are used as supplementary
conditions on the wave function. Their integrability conditions dictate, at a
first stage, that only one of the three existing symmetries can be consistently
imposed. At a second stage one is led to the unique Casimir invariant, which is
the product of the remaining two, as the only possible second condition on
$\Psi$. The uniqueness of the dynamical evolution implies the need to identify
this quadratic integral of motion to the reparametrisation generator. This can
be achieved by fixing a suitable parametrization of the r-lapse function,
exploiting the freedom to arbitrarily rescale it. In this particular
parametrization the measure is chosen to be the determinant of the supermetric.

the Data Release 9 (DR9) of the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS)

population by commonly employing an isolated single network. However, realistic
systems are composed of many interdependent networks coupled with each other,
rather than the isolated single one. In this paper, we consider a system
including two interacting networks with the same size, entangled with each
other by the introduction of probabilistic interconnections. We introduce the
public goods game into such system, and study how the probabilistic
interconnection influences the evolution of cooperation of the whole system and
the coupling effect between two layers of interdependent networks. Simulation
results show that there exists an intermediate region of interconnection
probability leading to the maximum cooperation level in the whole system.
Interestingly, we find that at the optimal interconnection probability the
fraction of internal links between cooperators in two layers is maximal. Also,
even if initially there are no cooperators in one layer of interdependent
networks, cooperation can still be promoted by probabilistic interconnection,
and the cooperation levels in both layers can more easily reach an agreement at
the intermediate interconnection probability. Our results may be helpful in
understanding the cooperative behavior in some realistic interdependent
networks and thus highlight the importance of probabilistic interconnection on
the evolution of cooperation.

into account Holstein-like coupling of a local phonon mode to the molecular

canonical transformations with numerical renormalization-group calculations to
address the interactions nonperturbatively and on equal footing, we obtain a
comprehensive description of the system's many-body physics in the
anti-adiabatic regime where the phonons adjust rapidly to changes in the
orbital occupancies, and are thereby able to strongly affect the Kondo physics.
The electron-phonon interactions strongly modify the bare orbital energies and
the Coulomb repulsion between electrons in the molecule, and tend to inhibit
tunneling of electrons between the molecule and the leads. The consequences of
these effects are considerably more pronounced when both molecular orbitals lie
near the Fermi energy of the leads than when only one orbital is active. In
situations where a local moment forms on the molecule, there is a crossover
with increasing electron-phonon coupling from a regime of collective Kondo
screening of the moment to a limit of local phonon quenching. At low
temperatures, this crossover is associated with a rapid increase in the
electronic occupancy of the molecule as well as a marked drop in the linear
electrical conductance through the single-molecule junction.

it is argued that the pair of particles begin to be produced efficiently from
the vacuum only in the fields of strength E >= E_cr. However, the direct
calculation shows that the Schwinger formula for creation of e+e- pairs is
valid only at the field intensities of E < 0.0291*E_cr. At higher fields, the
probability of pair production in an unit space-time volume exceeds unity. In

whether star/planet formation are influenced by the cluster environment. The
stellar density in the most prevalent clusters is the key factor here. Whether
dominant modes of clustered star formation exist is a fundamental question.
Using near-neighbour searches in young clusters Bressert et al. (2010) claim
this not to be the case and conclude that star formation is continuous from
isolated to densely clustered. We investigate under which conditions
near-neighbour searches can distinguish between different modes of clustered
star formation. Near-neighbour searches are performed for model star clusters
investigating the influence of the combination of different cluster modes,
observational biases, and types of diagnostic and find that the cluster density
profile, the relative sample sizes, limitations in observations and the choice
of diagnostic method decides whether modelled modes of clustered star formation
are detected. For centrally concentrated density distributions spanning a wide
density range (King profiles) separate cluster modes are only detectable if the
mean density of the individual clusters differs by at least a factor of ~65.
Introducing a central cut-off can lead to underestimating the mean density by
more than a factor of ten. The environmental effect on star and planet
formation is underestimated for half of the population in dense systems. A
analysis of a sample of cluster environments involves effects of superposition
that suppress characteristic features and promotes erroneous conclusions. While
multiple peaks in the distribution of the local surface density imply the
existence of different modes, the reverse conclusion is not possible. Equally,
a smooth distribution is not a proof of continuous star formation, because such
a shape can easily hide modes of clustered star formation (abridged)

nearly all models of cooperation implicitly assume that this structure remains
static. This is a simplifying assumption, because most organisms possess
genetic traits that affect their population structure to some degree. These
traits, such as a group size preference, affect the relatedness of interacting
individuals and hence the opportunity for kin or group selection. We argue that
models that do not explicitly consider their evolution cannot provide a
satisfactory account of the origin of cooperation, because they cannot explain
how the prerequisite population structures arise. Here, we consider the
concurrent evolution of genetic traits that affect population structure, with
those that affect social behavior. We show that not only does population
structure drive social evolution, as in previous models, but that the
opportunity for cooperation can in turn drive the creation of population
structures that support it. This occurs through the generation of linkage
disequilibrium between socio-behavioral and population-structuring traits, such
that direct kin selection on social behavior creates indirect selection
pressure on population structure. We illustrate our argument with a model of
the concurrent evolution of group size preference and social behavior.

off various fixed targets. During the years 2002-2007, COMPASS focused on
nucleon spin physics using 160 GeV/c polarised $\mu^+$ beams on polarised
deuteron and proton targets, including measurements of the gluon contribution
to the nucleon spin using longitudinal target polarisation as well as studies
of transverse spin effects in the nucleon on a transversely polarised target.
One major goal of the physics programme using hadron beams is the search for
new states, in particular the search for $J^{PC}$ exotic states and glue-balls.
COMPASS measures not only charged but also neutral final-state particles,
allowing for investigation of new objects in different reactions and decay
channels. In addition COMPASS can measure low-energy QCD constants like, e.g.
the electromagnetic polarisability of the pion. Apart from a few days pilot run
data taken in 2004 with a 190 GeV/c $\pi^{-}$ beam on a Pb target, showing a
significant spin-exotic $J^{PC}$ = $1^{-+}$ resonance at around 1660
MeV/$c^{2}$, COMPASS collected high statistics with negative and positive 190
GeV/$c$ hadron beams on a proton (H$_2$) and nuclear (Ni, Pb) targets in 2008

investigated out to redshift z~10. However, most of theoretical models for
galaxy formation underpredict the CSFRD at z>1. Since the theoretical models
reproduce the observed luminosity functions (LFs), luminosity densities (LDs),
and stellar mass density at each redshift, this inconsistency does not simply
imply that theoretical models should incorporate some missing unknown physical
processes in galaxy formation. Here, we examine the cause of this inconsistency
in UV wavelengths by using a mock catalog of galaxies generated by a
semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. We find that this inconsistency is due
to two observational uncertainties: dust obscuration correction and conversion
from UV luminosity to star formation rate (SFR). The methods for correction of
obscuration and SFR conversion used in observational studies result in the
overestimation of CSFRD by ~ 0.1-0.3 dex and ~ 0.1-0.2 dex, respectively,
compared to the results obtained directly from our mock catalog. We present new
empirical calibrations for dust attenuation and conversion from observed UV LFs
and LDs into CSFRD.

Information is the abstraction that allows us to refer to the states of systems

particular frameworks, like in classical or quantum theory, or more generally,
whenever there exists an information unit such that the state of any system can
be reversibly encoded in a sufficient number of such units. In this work we
show how the abstract formalism of quantum theory can be deduced solely from
the existence of an information unit with suitable properties, together with
two further natural assumptions: the continuity and reversibility of dynamics,
and the possibility of characterizing the state of a composite system by local
measurements. This constitutes a new set of postulates for quantum theory with
a simple and direct physical meaning, like the ones of special relativity or

granular matter. We consider a shape parameter $\eta$ describing the degree of
distortion from a perfectly spherical shape. Encompassing most specific shape
characteristics such as elongation, angularity and nonconvexity, $\eta$ is a
low-order but generic parameter that we used in a numerical benchmark test for
a systematic investigation of shape-dependence in sheared granular packings
composed of particles of different shapes. We find that the shear strength is
an increasing function of $\eta$ with nearly the same trend for all shapes, the
differences appearing thus to be of second order compared to $\eta$. We also
observe a nontrivial behavior of packing fraction which, for all our simulated
shapes, increases with $\eta$ from the random close packing fraction for disks,
reaches a peak considerably higher than that for disks, and subsequently
declines as $\eta$ is further increased. These findings suggest that a
low-order description of particle shape accounts for the principal trends of
packing fraction and shear strength. Hence, the effect of second-order shape
parameters may be investigated by considering different shapes at the same
level of $\eta$.

Superconductors at equilibrium and at finite temperature contain both paired
particles (of opposite spin) in the condensate phase as well as unpaired,
spin-randomised quasiparticles. Injecting spin-polarised electrons into a
superconductor thus creates both spin and charge imbalances [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7] (respectively Q* and S*, cf. Ref. [4]). These must relax when the injection
stops, but not necessarily over the same time (or length) scale as spin
relaxation requires spin-dependent interactions while charge relaxation does
not. These different relaxation times can be probed by creating a dynamic
equilibrium between continuous injection and relaxation, which leads to
constant-in-time spin and charge imbalances. These scale with their respective
relaxation times and with the injection current. While charge imbalances in
superconductors have been studied in great detail both theoretically [8] and
experimentally [9], spin imbalances have not received much experimental
attention [6, 10] despite intriguing theoretical predictions of spin-charge
separation effects [11, 12]. These could occur e.g. if the spin relaxation time
is longer than the charge relaxation time, i.e. Q* relaxes faster than S*.
Fundamentally, spin-charge decoupling in superconductors is possible because
quasiparticles can have any charge between e and -e, and also because the
condensate acts as a particle reservoir [13, 11, 12]. Here we present evidence
for an almost-chargeless spin imbalance in a mesoscopic superconductor.

relevant centre-of-mass energy of 240 GeV, near-constant luminosities of 10^34
cm^{-2}s^{-1} are possible in up to four collision points for a ring of 27km
circumference. The achievable luminosity increases with the bending radius, and
for 80km circumference, a luminosity of 5 10^34 cm^{-2}s^{-1} in four collision
points appears feasible. Beamstrahlung becomes relevant at these high
luminosities, leading to a design requirement of large momentum acceptance both
in the accelerating system and in the optics. The larger machine could reach
the top quark threshold, would yield luminosities per interaction point of
10^36 cm^{-2}s^{-1} at the Z pole (91 GeV) and 2 10^35 cm^{-2}s^{-1} at the W
pair production threshold (80 GeV per beam). The energy spread is reduced in
the larger ring with respect to what is was at LEP, giving confidence that beam
polarization for energy calibration purposes should be available up to the W
pair threshold. The capabilities in term of physics performance are outlined.

use the CANDELS Deep+Wide surveys in the GOODS-South, UDS and EGS fields,
complemented by data from the HUDF09 program, to address the relation between
size and luminosity at z\sim7. We select 153 z-band drop-out galaxies in six
different fields characterized by a wide combination of depth and areal
coverage, ideally suited to sample without biases the observed size-magnitude
plane. Detailed simulations allow us to derive the completeness as a function
of size and magnitude and to quantify measurements errors/biases. We find that
the half light radius distribution function of z\sim7 galaxies fainter than
J=26.6 is peaked at <0.1 arcsec (or equivalently 0.5 kpc proper), while at
brighter magnitudes high-z galaxies are typically larger than ~0.15 arcsec. We
also find a well defined size-luminosity relation, Rh\simL^1/2. We compute the
Luminosity Function in the HUDF and P12HUDF fields, finding large spatial
variation on the number density of faint galaxies. Adopting the size
distribution and the size-luminosity relation found for faint galaxies at z=7,
we derive a mean slope of -1.7\pm0.1 for the luminosity function of LBGs at
this redshift. Using this LF, we find that the amount of ionizing photons
cannot keep the Universe re-ionized if the IGM is clumpy (C_HII>3) and the
Lyman continuum escape fraction of high-z LBGs is relatively low (f_esc<0.3).
With future CANDELS data, we can put severe limits to the role of galaxies in
the reionization of the Universe.

rise to two waves emitted with a time delay with respect to each other at the

computing numerically and analyzing explicitly analytically a show-case example
of sequential two-photon ionization of an atom by resonant laser pulses, we
argue that this dynamic interference should be a general phenomenon in the

resonant Auger effect of an atom by intense free electron laser pulses, and
also to envisage experiments in which photons are emitted.

long baseline accelerator neutrino experiments. The community of European
neutrino physicists involved in oscillation experiments is strong enough to
support a major neutrino long baseline project in Europe, and has an ambitious,
competitive and coherent vision to propose. Following the 2006 European
Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) recommendations, two complementary design
studies have been carried out: LAGUNA/LBNO, focused on deep underground
detector sites, and EUROnu, focused on high intensity neutrino facilities.
LAGUNA LBNO recommends, as first step, a conventional neutrino beam CN2PY from
a CERN SPS North Area Neutrino Facility (NANF) aimed at the Pyhasalmi mine in
Finland. A sterile neutrino search experiment which could also be situated in
the CERN north area has been proposed (ICARUS-NESSIE) using a two detector
set-up, allowing a definitive answer to the 20 year old question open by the
LSND experiment. EUROnu concluded that a 10 GeV Neutrino Factory, aimed at a
magnetized neutrino detector situated, also, at a baseline of around 2200 km
(+-30%), would constitute the ultimate neutrino facility; it recommends that
the next 5 years be devoted to the R&D, preparatory experiments and
implementation study, in view of a proposal before the next ESPP update. The
coherence and quality of this program calls for the continuation of neutrino
beams at CERN after the CNGS, and for a high priority support from CERN and the
member states to the experiments and R&D program.

route towards the evolution of cooperation between individuals and the
subsequent formation of higher-level biological entities. Such group selection
explanations remain problematic, however, due to the narrow range of parameters
under which they can overturn within-group selection that favours selfish
behaviour. In principle, individual selection could act on such parameters so
as to strengthen the force of between-group selection and hence increase
cooperation and individual fitness, as illustrated in our previous work.
However, such a process cannot operate in parameter regions where group
selection effects are totally absent, since there would be no selective
gradient to follow. One key parameter, which when increased often rapidly
causes group selection effects to tend to zero, is initial group size, for when
groups are formed randomly then even moderately sized groups lack significant
variance in their composition. However, the consequent restriction of any group
selection effect to small sized groups is derived from models that assume
selfish types will competitively exclude their more cooperative counterparts at
within-group equilibrium. In such cases, diversity in the migrant pool can tend
to zero and accordingly variance in group composition cannot be generated. In
contrast, we show that if within-group dynamics lead to a stable coexistence of
selfish and cooperative types, then the range of group sizes showing some
effect of group selection is much larger.

such notions are controversial and poorly understood in natural populations.
The theoretic principles of group selection are well developed in idealised
models where a population is neatly divided into multiple semi-isolated
sub-populations. But since such models can be explained by individual selection
given the localised frequency-dependent effects involved, some argue that the
group selection concepts offered are, even in the idealised case, redundant and
that in natural conditions where groups are not well-defined that a group
selection framework is entirely inapplicable. This does not necessarily mean,
however, that a natural population is not subject to some interesting localised
frequency-dependent effects -- but how could we formally quantify this under
realistic conditions? Here we focus on the presence of a Simpson's Paradox
where, although the local proportion of cooperators decreases at all locations,
the global proportion of cooperators increases. We illustrate this principle in
a simple individual-based model of bacterial biofilm growth and discuss various
complicating factors in moving from theory to practice of measuring group

ranges in the limit of negligible electron fraction from about 4.3 eV for
diffuse atomic gas, to about 13 eV for the moderately dense regions of

cosmic-ray and X-ray heating depends on the physical properties of the medium,

nuclei, and to a lesser extent on the temperature. It is also noted that
chemical heating, the dominant process for cosmic-ray and X-ray heating, plays

  Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/757/1/76",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A leading formation scenario for R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars invokes the
merger of degenerate He and CO white dwarfs (WD) in a binary. The observed
ratio of 16O/18O for RCB stars is in the range of 0.3-20 much smaller than the
solar value of ~500. In this paper, we investigate whether such a low ratio can
be obtained in simulations of the merger of a CO and a He white dwarf. We
present the results of five 3-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the
merger of a double white dwarf system where the total mass is 0.9 Mdot and the
initial mass ratio (q) varies between 0.5 and 0.99. We identify in simulations
with $q\lesssim0.7$ a feature around the merged stars where the temperatures
and densities are suitable for forming 18O. However, more 16O is being
dredged-up from the C- and O-rich accretor during the merger than the amount of
18O that is produced. Therefore, on a dynamical time scale over which our
hydrodynamics simulation runs, a 16O/18O ratio of ~2000 in the ""best"" case is
found. If the conditions found in the hydrodynamic simulations persist for 10^6
seconds the oxygen ratio drops to 16 in one case studied, while in a hundred
years it drops to ~4 in another case studied, consistent with the observed
values in RCB stars. Therefore, the merger of two white dwarfs remains a strong
candidate for the formation of these enigmatic stars.

Phys. Rev. Lett. 106 130401) devoted to the study of the instability of the
superfluid flow of a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate in presence of a
repulsive optical barrier. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii mean-field equation, we
observe, consistently with what we found in Piazza et al (2009 Phys. Rev. A 80
021601), that the superflow with one unit of angular momentum becomes unstable
at a critical strength of the barrier, and decays through the mechanism of
phase slippage performed by pairs of vortex-antivortex lines annihilating.
While this picture qualitatively agrees with the experimental findings, the
measured critical barrier height is not very well reproduced by the
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, indicating that thermal fluctuations can play an
important role (Mathey et al 2012 arXiv:1207.0501). As an alternative
explanation of the discrepancy, we consider the effect of the finite resolution
of the imaging system. At the critical point, the superfluid velocity in the
vicinity of the obstacle is always of the order of the sound speed in that
region, $v_{\rm barr}=c_{\rm l}$. In particular, in the hydrodynamic regime
(not reached in the above experiment), the critical point is determined by
applying the Landau criterion inside the barrier region. On the other hand, the
Feynman critical velocity $v_{\rm f}$ is much lower than the observed critical
velocity. We argue that this is a general feature of the Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, where we have $v_{\rm f}=\epsilon\ c_{\rm l}$ with $\epsilon$ being a
small parameter of the model. Given these observations, the question still
remains open about the nature of the superfluid instability.
