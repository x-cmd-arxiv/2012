magnetic anisotropy (PMA) against thermally induced magnetization reversal is
important when designing perpendicularly magnetized patterned media and
magnetic random access memories. The leading-order dependence of magnetization
reversal rates are governed by the energy barrier the system needs to surmount
in order for reversal to proceed. In this paper we study the reversal dynamics
of these systems and compute the relevant barriers using the string method of
E, Vanden-Eijnden, and Ren. We find the reversal to be often spatially
incoherent; that is, rather than the magnetization flipping as a rigid unit,
reversal proceeds instead through a soliton-like domain wall sweeping through
the system. We show that for square nanomagnetic elements the energy barrier
increases with element size up to a critical length scale, beyond which the
energy barrier is constant. For circular elements the energy barrier continues
to increase indefinitely, albeit more slowly beyond a critical size. In both
cases the energy barriers are smaller than those expected for coherent
magnetization reversal.

mathematical physics, Birkhoff's theorem reads: up to singular exceptions of

Birkhoff-type theorems exist only for those physical situations which are

around product, functional and geographical dimensions and exhibit

functionally oriented Centers Of Excellence, product dimension World Product

the emerging SMBH, as function of the mass ratio, initial spin magnitudes, and
orientation of the spins with respect to the orbital plane and each other. This
formula approximates well more cumbersome expressions obtained from the fit
with numerical simulations. By integrating over all equally likely orientations
for precessing mergers we determine a lower approximant to the final spin
distribution as function of the mass ratio alone. By folding this with the
derived mass ratio dependent merger rate we derive a lower bound to the typical
final spin value after mergers. We repeat the procedure deriving an upper bound
for the typical spin in the case when the spins are aligned to the orbital
angular momentum, such that there is no precession in the system. Both slopes
of $\chi_{f}$ as function of the initial spins being smaller than one lead to
two attractors at $\chi_{f}^{prec}=0.2$ and $\chi_{f}^{align}=0.45$,
respectively. Real mergers, biased toward partial alignment by interactions
with the environment (accretion, host galaxy, etc.) would generate a typical
final spin lying between these two limiting values. These are the typical
values of the spin after the merger, starting from which the spin can built up

regional variations of seismic energy release to 290 km depth. These variations
reflect radial and lateral contrasts in thermomechanical competence, consistent
with a shear-dominated non-adiabatic boundary layer some 700-km thick, capped
by denser oceanic lithosphere as much as 100 km thick, or lighter continental
tectosphere 170 to 260 km thick. Thus, isobaric shearing at
fractally-distributed depths likely facilitates toroidal plate rotations while
minimizing global energy dissipation. Shear localization in the shallow crust
occurs as dislocations at finite angles with respect to the shortening
direction, with a 30 degree angle being the most likely. Consequently,
relatively low-angle reverse faults, steep normal faults, and triple junctions
with orthogonal or hexagonal symmetry are likely to form in regions of crustal
shortening, extension, and transverse motion, respectively. Thermomechanical
theory also predicts adiabatic conditions in the mantle below about 1000-km
depth, consistent with observed variations in bulk sound speed.

understanding of the neutrino mass generation and a precise, relativistic
description of hadrons, and observing that such a future theory may require
Dirac's FF of Hamiltonian dynamics, we provide a preliminary FF description of
neutrino oscillations using the Feynman--Gell-Mann-Levy version of an effective
theory in which leptons interact directly with whole nucleons and pions,
instead of with quarks via intermediate bosons. The interactions are treated in
the lowest-order perturbative expansion in the coupling constants in the
effective theory, including a perturbative solution of the coupled constraint
equations. Despite missing quarks and their binding mechanism, the effective
Hamiltonian description is sufficiently precise for showing that the standard
oscillation formula results from the interference of amplitudes with different
neutrinos in virtual intermediate states. This holds provided that the inherent
experimental uncertainties of preparing beams of incoming and measuring rates
of production of outgoing particles are large enough for all of the different
neutrino intermediate states to contribute as alternative virtual paths through
which the long-baseline scattering process can manifest itself. The result that
an approximate, effective FF theory reproduces the standard oscillation formula
at the level of transition rates for currently considered long-baseline
experiments--even though the space-time development of scattering is traced
differently and the relevant interaction Hamiltonians are constructed
differently than in the commonly used IF of dynamics--has two implications. It
shows that the common interpretation of experimental results is not the only
one, and it opens the possibility of considering more precise theories taking
advantage of the features of the FF that are not available in the IF.

potentially miniaturize the numerous applications of conventional frequency
combs. A priority is the realization of broad-band (ideally octave spanning)
spectra at detectable repetition rates for comb self referencing. However,
access to these rates involves pumping larger mode volumes and hence higher
threshold powers. Moreover, threshold power sets both the scale for power per
comb tooth and also the optical pump. Along these lines, it is shown that a
class of resonators having surface-loss-limited Q factors can operate over a
wide range of repetition rates with minimal variation in threshold power. A
new, surface-loss-limited resonator illustrates the idea. Comb generation on
mode spacings ranging from 2.6 GHz to 220 GHz with overall low threshold power
(as low as 1 mW) is demonstrated. A record number of comb lines for a microcomb
(around 1900) is also observed with pump power of 200 mW. The ability to
engineer a wide range of repetition rates with these devices is also used to
investigate a recently observed mechanism in microcombs associated with
dispersion of subcomb offset frequencies. We observe high-coherence,
phase-locking in cases where these offset frequencies are small enough so as to
be tuned into coincidence. In these cases, a record-low microcomb phase noise
is reported at a level comparable to an open-loop, high-performance microwave

Thomson, Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr. We first examine the origins of
Thomson's mechanical atomic models, from his ethereal vortex atoms in the early
1880's, to the myriad ""corpuscular"" atoms he proposed following the discovery
of the electron in 1897. Beyond predictions for the periodicity of the
elements, the application of Thomson's atoms to problems in scattering and
absorption led to quantitative predictions that were confirmed by experiments
with high-velocity electrons traversing thin sheets of metal. Still, the much
more massive and energetic {\alpha}-particles being studied by Rutherford were
better suited for exploring the interior of the atom, and careful measurements
on the angular dependence of their scattering eventually allowed him to infer
the existence of an atomic nucleus. Niels Bohr was particularly troubled by the
radiative instability inherent to any mechanical atom, and succeeded in 1913
where others had failed in the prediction of emission spectra, by making two
bold hypotheses that were in contradiction to the laws of classical physics,
but necessary in order to account for experimental facts.

demonstrated by hybrid techniques that combine light with the deeper
penetration capability of sound waves. Deep inside highly scattering media, the
sound focus dimensions restrict the imaging resolutions. Here we show that by
iteratively focusing light into an ultrasound focus via phase conjugation, we
can fundamentally overcome this resolution barrier in deep tissues and at the

the annual parallax of a group of the water maser spots, pi=0.400+/-0.025 mas,
corresponding to a distance to I22480 of D=2.50 /+0.17/-0.15 kpc. This suggests
that the estimated bolometric luminosity of I22480 should be revised to 35 000
L_sun, favoring a K-type supergiant rather than an RV Tau-type variable star
previously suggested. Although the spectral type is unusual as a stellar maser
source, the internal motions of the water maser features suggest that the water
masers are associated with the circumstellar envelope of this star. Taking into
account a possible stellar motion with respect to the maser feature motions, we
derived a secular proper motion of I22480, (mu_alpha, mu_delta)=(-2.58+/-0.33,
-1.91+/-0.17) [mas yr^-1]. The derived motion of I22480 in the Milky Way has a
deviation by ~ -30 km/s in the galactic azimuthal direction from a circular
motion estimated from the galactocentric distance to I22480 and assumption of a
flat Galactic rotation curve. This peculiar motion is still comparable to those
typically seen in the water maser sources located in the Perseus spiral arm.
Taking into account the peculiar motion and the proximity to the Galactic
midplane (z ~60 pc), I22480 may be a member of the Galactic thin disk.

observed in detail by the SDO/AIA and of the harmonic type-II burst sources,
observed by the NRH at ten frequencies from 445 to 151 MHz, is studied for the
partially behind the limb event on 3 November 2010. Special attention is given
to the band-splitting of the burst. Analysis is supplemented by investigation
of coronal hard X-ray (HXR) sources observed by the RHESSI. Results. It is
found that the flare impulsive phase was accompanied by the formation of a
double coronal HXR source, whose upper part coincided with the hot (T~10 MK)
eruptive plasma blob. The leading edge (LE) of the eruptive plasmas (T~1-2 MK)
moved upward from the flare region with the speed of v=900-1400 km/s. The type
II burst source initially appeared just above the LE apex and moved with the
same speed and in the same direction. After about 20 s it started to move about
twice faster, but still in the same direction. At any given moment the low
frequency component (LFC) source of the splitted type-II burst was situated
above the high frequency component (HFC) source, which in turn was situated
above the LE. It is also found that at a given frequency the HFC source was
located slightly closer to the photosphere than the LFC source. Conclusions.
The shock wave, which could be responsible for the observed type-II radio
burst, was initially driven by the multi-temperature eruptive plasmas, but
later transformed to a freely propagating blast shock wave. The most preferable
interpretation of the type-II burst splitting is that its LFC was emitted from
the upstream region of the shock, whereas the HFC - from the downstream region.

""obscuring tori"" around active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations including radiative feedback from
the central source. The X-ray heating and radiation pressure on the gas are
explicitly calculated using a ray-tracing method. This radiation feedback
drives a ""fountain"", that is, a vertical circulation of gas in the central a
few to tens parsecs. Interaction between the non-steady outflows and inflows
causes the formation of a geometrically thick torus with internal turbulent
motion. As a result, the AGN is obscured for a wide range of solid angles. In a
quasi-steady state, the opening angles for the column density toward a black
hole < 10^23 cm^-2 are approximately +-30 deg and +-50 deg for AGNs with 10%
and 1% Eddington luminosity, respectively. Mass inflows through the torus
coexist with the outflow and internal turbulent motion, and the average mass
accretion rate to the central parsec region is 2x10^-4 ~ 10^-3, M_sun/yr this
is about ten times smaller than accretion rate required to maintain the AGN
luminosity. This implies that relatively luminous AGN activity is intrinsically

  theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We establish the existence of wave-like solutions to spatially coupled
graphical models which, in the large size limit, can be characterized by a
one-dimensional real-valued state. This is extended to a proof of the threshold
saturation phenomenon for all such models, which includes spatially coupled
irregular LDPC codes over the BEC, but also addresses hard-decision decoding
for transmission over general channels, the CDMA multiple-access problem,
compressed sensing, and some statistical physics models.
  For traditional uncoupled iterative coding systems with two components and
transmission over the BEC, the asymptotic convergence behavior is completely
characterized by the EXIT curves of the components. More precisely, the system
converges to the desired fixed point, which is the one corresponding to perfect
decoding, if and only if the two EXIT functions describing the components do
not cross. For spatially coupled systems whose state is one-dimensional a
closely related graphical criterion applies. Now the curves are allowed to
cross, but not by too much. More precisely, we show that the threshold
saturation phenomenon is related to the positivity of the (signed) area
enclosed by two EXIT-like functions associated to the component systems, a very
intuitive and easy-to-use graphical characterization.
  In the spirit of EXIT functions and Gaussian approximations, we also show how
to apply the technique to higher dimensional and even infinite-dimensional
cases. In these scenarios the method is no longer rigorous, but it typically
gives accurate predictions. To demonstrate this application, we discuss
transmission over general channels using both the belief-propagation as well as
the min-sum decoder.

provide a context for the study of non-equilibrium dynamics and the formation
of topological defects. The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism predicts the scaling of
the resulting density of defects as a function of the quench rate through a
critical point, and this can provide an estimate of the critical exponents of a
phase transition. In this work we extend our previous study of the
miscible-immiscible phase transition of a binary Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
composed of two hyperfine states in which the spin dynamics are confined to one
dimension [J. Sabbatini et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 230402 (2011)]. The
transition is engineered by controlling a Hamiltonian quench of the coupling
amplitude of the two hyperfine states, and results in the formation of a random
pattern of spatial domains. Using the numerical truncated Wigner phase space
method, we show that in a ring BEC the number of domains formed in the phase
transitions scales as predicted by the KZ theory. We also consider the same
experiment performed with a harmonically trapped BEC, and investigate how the
density inhomogeneity modifies the dynamics of the phase transition and the KZ
scaling law for the number of domains. We then make use of the symmetry between
inhomogeneous phase transitions in anisotropic systems, and an inhomogeneous
quench in a homogeneous system, to engineer coupling quenches that allow us to
quantify several aspects of inhomogeneous phase transitions. In particular, we
quantify the effect of causality in the propagation of the phase transition
front on the resulting formation of domain walls, and find indications that the
density of defects is determined during the impulse to adiabatic transition
after the crossing of the critical point.

great interest to those tasked with monitoring and conserving ecosystems. For
decades, research in this area has relied upon multimetric indices of various
forms. Although indices may be numbers, many are constructed based on
procedures that are highly qualitative in nature, thus limiting the
quantitative rigour of the practical interpretations made from these indices.
The statistical modelling approach to construct the latent health factor index
(LHFI) was recently developed to express ecological data, collected to
construct conventional multimetric health indices, in a rigorous quantitative
model that integrates qualitative features of ecosystem health and preconceived
ecological relationships among such features. This hierarchical modelling
approach allows (a) statistical inference of health for observed sites and (b)
prediction of health for unobserved sites, all accompanied by formal
uncertainty statements. Thus far, the LHFI approach has been demonstrated and
validated on freshwater ecosystems. The goal of this paper is to adapt this
approach to modelling estuarine ecosystem health, particularly that of the
previously unassessed system in Richibucto in New Brunswick, Canada. Field data
correspond to biotic health metrics that constitute the AZTI marine biotic
index (AMBI) and abiotic predictors preconceived to influence biota. We also
briefly discuss related LHFI research involving additional metrics that form
the infaunal trophic index (ITI). Our paper is the first to construct a
scientifically sensible model to rigorously identify the collective explanatory
capacity of salinity, distance downstream, channel depth, and silt-clay content
--- all regarded a priori as qualitatively important abiotic drivers ---
towards site health in the Richibucto ecosystem.

natural science. Various nonlinear excitations of the NLS equation have been
found by many methods. However, except for the soliton-soliton interactions, it
is very difficult to find interaction solutions between different types of
nonlinear excitations. In this paper, three very simple and powerful methods,
the symmetry reduction method, the truncated Painlev\'e analysis and the
generalized tanh function expansion approach, are further developed to find
interaction solutions between solitons and other types of NLS waves.
Especially, the soliton-cnoidal wave interaction solutions are explicitly
studied in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions and the third type of
incomplete elliptic integrals. In addition to the new method and new solutions
of the NLS equation, the results can unearth some new physics. The solitons may
be decelerated/accelerated through the interactions of soliton with background
waves which may be utilized to study tsunami waves and fiber soliton
communications; the static/moving optical lattices may be automatically excited
in all mediums described by the NLS systems; solitons elastically interact with
non-soliton background waves, and the elastic interaction property with only
phase shifts provides a new mechanism to produce a controllable routing switch
that is applicable in optical information and optical communications.

energy losses or damping of the magnetic field. Aims. We want to investigate
whether or not different models of these filaments can be observationally
tested. Methods. Using observational parameters of four historical remnants, we
calculate the filament profiles and compare the spectra of the filaments with
those of the total non-thermal emission. For that purpose, we solve an
one-dimensional stationary transport equation for the isotropic differential
number density of the electrons. Results. We find that the difference between
the spectra of filament and total non-thermal emission above 1 keV is more
pronounced in the damping model than in the energy-loss model. Conclusions. A
considerable damping of the magnetic field can result in an observable
difference between the spectra of filament and total non-thermal emission, thus

Considering
tight-binding models for electrons on stacked honeycomb layers, this gives rise

Depending on the stacking order these band structures enhance or reduce the
role of electron-electron interactions. Here, we investigate the instabilities
of interacting electrons on honeycomb multilayers with a focus on trilayers
with ABA and ABC stackings theoretically by means of the functional
renormalization group. We find different types of competing instabilities and

dominant instabilities turn out to be toward an antiferromagnetic spin-density

Ab-initio values for the interaction parameters put the systems at the border
between SDW and QSH regimes. Furthermore, we discuss the energy scales for the
interaction-induced gaps of this model study and put them into context with the
scales for single-layer and Bernal-stacked bilayer honeycomb lattices. This
yields a comprehensive picture of the possible interaction-induced ground

beams within the outer gaps, at distances above $\sim$ 20 NS radii. The outward
moving beam produces UV-$X$-ray photons via Doppler-booster cyclotron emission,
and GeV photons by Compton scattering the cyclotron photons produced by the
inward going beam. The scattering occurs in the deep Klein-Nishina regime,
whereby the IC component provides a direct measurement of particle distribution
within the magnetosphere. The required plasma multiplicity is high, $\sim
10^6-10^7$, but is consistent with the average particle flux injected into the
pulsar wind nebula.
  The importance of Compton scattering in the Klein-Nishina regime also implies
the importance of pair production in the outer gaps. We suggest that outer gaps
are important sources of pairs in pulsar magnetospheres.
  Cyclotron motion of particles in the pulsar magnetosphere may be excited due
to coherent emission of radio waves by streaming particles at the anomalous
cyclotron resonance. Thus, a whole range of Crab non-thermal emission, from
coherent radio waves to very high energy $\gamma$-rays - nearly eighteen
decades in energy - may be a manifestation of inter-dependent radiation
processes.
  The present model, together with the observational evidence in favor of the
IC scattering (Lyutikov et al. 2012; Lyutikov 2012), demonstrates that the
inverse Compton scattering can be the dominant high energy emission mechanism

structure of graphene, is responsible of many of the outstanding electronic
properties found in this material. This article provides a clear understanding
of how such pseudospin impacts the quasiparticle interferences of monolayer
(ML) and bilayer (BL) graphene measured by low temperature scanning tunneling
microscopy and spectroscopy. We have used this technique to map, with very high
energy and space resolution, the spatial modulations of the local density of
states of ML and BL graphene epitaxialy grown on SiC(0001), in presence of
native disorder. We perform a Fourier transform analysis of such modulations
including wavevectors up to unit-vectors of the reciprocal lattice. Our data
demonstrate that the quasiparticle interferences associated to some particular
scattering processes are suppressed in ML graphene, but not in BL graphene.
Most importantly, interferences with 2qF wavevector associated to intravalley
backscattering are not measured in ML graphene, even on the images with highest
resolution. In order to clarify the role of the pseudospin on the quasiparticle
interferences, we use a simple model which nicely captures the main features
observed on our data. The model unambiguously shows that graphene's pseudospin
is responsible for such suppression of quasiparticle interferences features in
ML graphene, in particular for those with 2qF wavevector. It also confirms
scanning tunneling microscopy as a unique technique to probe the pseudospin in
graphene samples in real space with nanometer precision. Finally, we show that
such observations are robust with energy and obtain with great accuracy the
dispersion of the \pi-bands for both ML and BL graphene in the vicinity of the
Fermi level, extracting their main tight binding parameters.

following study, we investigate the prospects for CTA to study several science
questions that influence our current knowledge of fundamental physics. Based on
conservative assumptions for the performance of the different CTA telescope
configurations, we employ a Monte Carlo based approach to evaluate the
prospects for detection. First, we discuss CTA prospects for cold dark matter
searches, following different observational strategies: in dwarf satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way, in the region close to the Galactic Centre, and in
clusters of galaxies. The possible search for spatial signatures, facilitated
by the larger field of view of CTA, is also discussed. Next we consider
searches for axion-like particles which, besides being possible candidates for
dark matter may also explain the unexpectedly low absorption by extragalactic
background light of gamma rays from very distant blazars. Simulated
light-curves of flaring sources are also used to determine the sensitivity to
violations of Lorentz Invariance by detection of the possible delay between the
arrival times of photons at different energies. Finally, we mention searches
for other exotic physics with CTA.

spacetimes with Lifshitz dimensions exhibits, and provide expressions of the
energy in terms of multidimensional zeta functions for the massless case. Using
the zeta-regularization method, we found that when the 4-dimensional spacetime
has Lifshitz dimensions, then for specific values of the critical exponents,
the Casimir energy is singular, in contrast to the non-Lifshitz case.
Particularly we found that when the value of the critical exponent is $z=2$,
the Casimir energy is singular, while for $z\geq 3$ the Casimir energy is
regular. In addition, when flat extra dimensions are considered, the critical
exponents of the Lifshitz dimensions affect drastically the Casimir energy,
introducing singularities that are absent in the non-Lifshitz case. We also
discuss the Casimir energy in the context of braneworld models and the
perspective of Lifshitz dimensions in such framework.

diagram in an external magnetic field including a sequence of magnetization
plateaux. The by far experimentally most studied and most prominent
magnetization plateau is the 1/8 plateau. Theoretically, one expects that this
material is well described by the Shastry-Sutherland model. But recent
microscopic calculations indicate that the 1/8 plateau is energetically not
favored. Here we report on a very simple microscopic mechanism which naturally
leads to a 1/8 plateau for realistic values of the magnetic exchange constants.
We show that the 1/8 plateau with a diamond unit cell benefits most compared to
other plateau structures from quantum fluctuations which to a large part are
induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Physically, such couplings
result in kinetic terms in an effective hardcore boson description leading to a
renormalization of the energy of the different plateaux structures which we
treat in this work on the mean-field level. The stability of the resulting
plateaux are discussed. Furthermore, our results indicate a series of stripe
structures above 1/8 and a stable magnetization plateau at 1/6. Most
qualitative aspects of our microscopic theory agree well with a recently
formulated phenomenological theory for the experimental data of SrCu_2(BO_3)_2.
Interestingly, our calculations point to a rather large ratio of the magnetic
couplings in the Shastry-Sutherland model such that non-perturbative effects
become essential for the understanding of the frustrated quantum magnet
SrCu_2(BO_3)_2.

insider knows this barrier (as it can be the case for example for the manager
of the counterparty), whereas standard investors only observe its value at the
default time. All investors aim to maximize the expected utility from terminal
wealth, on a financial market where the risky asset price is exposed to a
sudden loss at the default time of the counterparty. In this framework, the
insider's information is modelled by using an initial enlargement of filtration

that the regulator must impose short selling constraints for the insider, in

optimization problem and we study the gain of the insider, theoretically and
numerically. In general, the insider achieves a larger value of expected
utility than the standard investor. But in extreme situations for the default

Additionally, we give a proof that a polygonal curve associated with a sample
of $n$ random variables (satisfying $\int_0^{2\pi} e^{ix}d\mu(x)=0$) converges
to a CCS associated with $\mu$ at speed $\sqrt{n}$, a result much similar to
the convergence of the empirical process in statistics. Finally, we employ this
correspondence to present models of smooth random CCS and simulations.

""affine-invariant"" codes. Affine-invariant codes are simply linear codes whose
coordinates are a vector space over a field and which are invariant under
affine-transformations of the coordinate space. Lifting takes codes defined
over a vector space of small dimension and lifts them to higher dimensions by
requiring their restriction to every subspace of the original dimension to be a
codeword of the code being lifted. While the operation is of interest on its
own, this work focusses on new ranges of parameters that can be obtained by
such codes, in the context of local correction and testing. In particular we
present four interesting ranges of parameters that can be achieved by such
lifts, all of which are new in the context of affine-invariance and some may be
new even in general. The main highlight is a construction of high-rate codes
with sublinear time decoding. The only prior construction of such codes is due
to Kopparty, Saraf and Yekhanin \cite{KSY}. All our codes are extremely simple,
being just lifts of various parity check codes (codes with one symbol of
redundancy), and in the final case, the lift of a Reed-Solomon code.
  We also present a simple connection between certain lifted codes and lower
bounds on the size of ""Nikodym sets"". Roughly, a Nikodym set in
$\mathbb{F}_q^m$ is a set $S$ with the property that every point has a line
passing through it which is almost entirely contained in $S$. While previous
lower bounds on Nikodym sets were roughly growing as $q^m/2^m$, we use our
lifted codes to prove a lower bound of $(1 - o(1))q^m$ for fields of constant
characteristic.

In the low-density regime, it is very striking that the resulting pairing order
parameter is a nearly isotropic singlet pairing and the physics can be well
described by an s-wave resonant interaction potential with finite range
corrections, despite of the anisotropic nature of dipolar interaction. The
pairing energy is as strong as a unitary Fermi gas nearby a magnetic Feshbach
resonance. In the high density regime, the anisotropic effect plays an
important role. We find phase transitions from singlet pairing to a state with
mixed singlet and triplet pairing, and then from mixed pairing to pure triplet
pairing. The state with mixed pairing spontaneously breaks the time-reversal

play a key role in the physics of the pseudogap phase. However, main
experimental observations motivated by this sophisticated proposal and
seemingly supporting the CC model can be explained in frames of a simple and
physically clear microscopic model. We argue that instead of a well-isolated
Zhang-Rice (ZR) singlet $^1A_{1g}$ the ground state of the hole center
[CuO$_4$]$^{5-}$ (cluster analog of Cu$^{3+}$ ion) in cuprates should be
described by a complex $^1A_{1g}$-$^{1,3}B_{2g}$-$^{1,3}E_u$ multiplet, formed
by a competition of conventional hybrid Cu 3d-O 2p $b_{1g}(\sigma)\propto
d_{x^2 -y^2}$ state and {\it purely oxygen nonbonding} O 2p$\pi$ states with
$a_{2g}(\pi)$ and $e_{ux,y}(\pi)$ symmetry. In contrast with inactive ZR
singlet we arrive at several novel competing orbital and spin-orbital order
parameters, e.g., Ising-like net orbital magnetic moment, orbital toroidal
moment, intra-plaquette's staggered order of Ising-like oxygen orbital magnetic
moments. As a most impressive validation of the non-ZR model we explain
fascinating results of recent neutron scattering measurements that revealed
novel type of magnetic ordering in pseudogap phase of several hole-doped
cuprates.

solving for the vertical displacement of a simply suspended thin plate under
