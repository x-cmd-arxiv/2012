theory of metals - is presented by complex materials with strong electronic
correlations. In these materials, non-Fermi liquid transport and thermodynamic
properties are often explained by the presence of a continuous quantum phase
transition which happens at a quantum critical point (QCP). A QCP can be
revealed by applying pressure, magnetic field, or changing the chemical
composition. In the heavy-fermion compound CeCoIn$_5$, the QCP is assumed to
play a decisive role in defining the microscopic structure of both normal and
superconducting states. However, the question of whether QCP must be present in
the material's phase diagram to induce non-Fermi liquid behavior and trigger
superconductivity remains open. Here we show that the full suppression of the
field-induced QCP in CeCoIn$_5$ by doping with Yb has surprisingly little
impact on both unconventional superconductivity and non-Fermi liquid behavior.
This implies that the non-Fermi liquid metallic behavior could be a new state
of matter in its own right rather then a consequence of the underlying quantum
phase transition.

surfaces, the infinite-n ideal MHD ballooning stability boundary is strongly
perturbed by the 3-D modulations of the local magnetic shear associated with
the presence of nearresonant Pfirsch-Schluter currents. These currents are
driven by 3-D components of the magnetic field spectrum even when there is no

is often used as a proxy for the onset of virulent kinetic ballooning modes

that the average of a random sample, $Y_1, ..., Y_n$, tends to $\mu$ as $n$
tends to infinity. This article explores how one can reliably construct a
confidence interval for $\mu$ with a prescribed half-width (or error tolerance)
$\varepsilon$. Our proposed two-stage algorithm assumes that the kurtosis of
$Y$ does not exceed some user-specified bound. An initial independent and
identically distributed (IID) sample is used to confidently estimate the
variance of $Y$. A Berry-Esseen inequality then makes it possible to determine
the size of the IID sample required to construct the desired confidence
interval for $\mu$. We discuss the important case where $Y=f(\vX)$ and $\vX$ is
a random $d$-vector with probability density function $\rho$. In this case
$\mu$ can be interpreted as the integral $\int_{\reals^d} f(\vx) \rho(\vx) \dif
\vx$, and the Monte Carlo method becomes a method for multidimensional
cubature.

where the key question is to determine $h_F(n,q)$, the minimum number of copies
of $F$ that a graph with $n$ vertices and $\ex(n,F)+q$ edges can have.
  We determine $h_F(n,q)$ asymptotically when $F$ is \emph{color-critical}

$q=o(n^2)$.
  Determining the exact value of $h_F(n,q)$ seems rather difficult. For

device as it may cause private data of the user to be public. To safeguard the
user data and also to preserve user privacy we propose and model the technique
of ownership authentication transfer. The user who is willing to sell the
device has to transfer the ownership of the device under sale. Once the device
is sold and the ownership has been transferred, the old owner will not be able
to use that device at any cost. Either of the users will not be able to use the
device if the process of ownership has not been carried out properly. This also
takes care of the scenario when the device has been stolen or lost, avoiding
the impersonation attack. The aim of this paper is to model basic process of
proposed ownership authentication transfer protocol and check its safety
properties by representing it using CSP and model checking approach. For model
checking we have used a symbolic model checker tool called NuSMV. The safety
properties of ownership transfer protocol has been modeled in terms of CTL
specification and it is observed that the system satisfies all the protocol

Our analysis is based on a mosaic of 18 multi-passband images obtained with ACS
aboard the HST, covering an area of \sim 10x20 arcmin^2. We use a weak-lensing
pipeline developed for the COSMOS survey, modified for the analysis of galaxy
clusters, to produce a weak-lensing catalogue. A mass map is then computed by
applying a weak-gravitational-lensing multi-scale reconstruction technique
designed to describe irregular mass distributions such as the one investigated
here. We test the resulting mass map by comparing the mass distribution
inferred for the cluster core with the one derived from strong-lensing
constraints and find excellent agreement. The filament is detected within the 3
sigma detection contour of the lensing mass reconstruction, and underlines the
importance of filaments for theoretical and numerical models of the mass
distribution in the Cosmic Web. We measure the filament's projected length as
\sim 4.5 h_{74}^{-1} Mpc, and its mean density as (2.92 \pm 0.66)10^8 h_{74}
M_{\odot} kpc^{-2}. Combined with the redshift distribution of galaxies
obtained after an extensive spectroscopic follow-up in the area, we can rule
out any projection effect resulting from the chance alignment on the sky of
unrelated galaxy group-scale structures. Assuming plausible constraints
concerning the structure's geometry based on its galaxy velocity field, we
construct a 3D model of the large-scale filament. Within this framework, we
derive the three-dimensional length of the filament to be 18 h_{74}^{-1} Mpc,
and a deprojected density in terms of the critical density of the Universe of
(206 \pm 46) \rho_{crit}, a value that lies at the very high end of the range

dominant on spatial scales below 600 km. Their size is distributed as a power
law with an index of -1.8 (which is close to the Kolmogorov's -5/3 law) and no

distribution with a mean diameter of 1050 km. Mini-granular structures
contribute significantly to the total granular area. They are predominantly
confined to the wide dark lanes between regular granules and often form chains

fibration over a curve has a section. We study an analogous question in
symplectic geometry. Namely, given a rationally connected fibration over a
curve, can one find a section which gives a non-zero Gromov-Witten invariant?
We observe that for any fibration, the existence of a section which gives a
non-zero Gromov-Witten invariant only depends on the generic fiber, i.e. a
variety defined over the function field of a curve. Some examples of rationally
connected fibrations with this property are given, including all rational
surface fibrations. We also prove some results, which says that in certain
cases we can ""lift"" Gromov-Witten invariants of the base to the total space of
a rationally connected fibration.

minimize both total travel costs of road users and total emission on a

dependent on the choice of datasets included in the analysis and the ability to
control the systematic uncertainties associated with these datasets. Our
analysis includes a variety of cosmological probes including the cosmic
microwave background (WMAP7+SPT), Hubble constant (HST), galaxy power spectrum
(SDSS-DR7), and supernova distances (SDSS and Union2 compilations). In the
joint observational analysis, our sterile neutrino model is equally favored as
a LCDM model when using the MLCS light curve fitter for the supernova
measurements, and strongly disfavored by the data at \Delta\chi^2 ~ 18 when
using the SALT2 fitter. When excluding the supernova measurements, the sterile
neutrino model is disfavored by the other datasets at \Delta\chi^2 ~ 12, and at
best becomes mildly disfavored at \Delta\chi^2 ~ 3 when allowing for curvature,
evolving dark energy, additional relativistic species, running of the spectral
index, and freedom in the primordial helium abundance. No single additional
parameter accounts for most of this effect. Therefore, if laboratory
experiments continue to favor a scenario with roughly eV mass sterile
neutrinos, and if this becomes decisively disfavored by cosmology, then a more
exotic cosmological model than explored here may become necessary.

emission from several molecules in the coma was measured with high
signal-to-noise ratio in January 2005 at heliocentric distance of 1.2 AU by
means of high-resolution spectroscopic observations using the Submillimeter
Telescope (SMT). We have obtained production rates of several volatiles (CH3OH,
HCN, H13CN, HNC, H2CO, CO and CS) by comparing the observed and simulated
line-integrated intensities. Furthermore, multiline observations of the CH3OH
(7-6) series allow us to estimate the rotational temperature using the rotation
diagram technique. We find that the CH3OH population distribution of the levels
sampled by these lines can be described by a rotational temperature of 40 \pm 3
K. Derived mixing ratios relative to hydrogen cyanide are
CO/CH3OH/H2CO/CS/HNC/H13CN/HCN = 30.9/24.6/4.8/0.57/0.031/0.013/1 assuming a
pointing offset of 8"" due to the uncertain ephemeris at the time of the
observations and the telescope pointing error. The measured relative molecular
abundances in C/2004 Q2 (Machholz) are between low- to typical values of those
obtained in Oort Cloud comets, suggesting that it has visited the inner solar
system previously and undergone thermal processing. The HNC/HCN abundance ratio
of ~3.1% is comparable to that found in other comets, accounting for the
dependence on the heliocentric distance, and could possibly be explained by
ion-molecule chemical processes in the low-temperature atmosphere. From a

be long (years) or short (days). Few studies have been carried out to assess
the orbital parameters of these spectroscopic composite binaries; current
observations suggest the periods are long. To help address this problem, we
selected fifteen moderately-bright (V~13) hot subdwarfs with F-K dwarf
companions and monitored their radial velocities (RVs) from January 2005 to
July 2008 using the bench-mounted Medium Resolution Spectrograph on the
Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). Here we describe the details of our observing,
reduction, and analysis techniques and present preliminary results for all

using more than 6 years of observations. We also present an up-to-date period
histogram for all known hot subdwarf binaries, which suggests those with F-K
main sequence companions tend to have orbital periods on the order of several
years. Such long periods challenge the predictions of conventional BPS models,
although a larger sample is needed for a thorough assessment of the models'
predictive success. Lastly, one of our targets has an eccentric orbit, implying
some composite-spectrum systems might have formerly been hierarchical triple
systems, in which the inner binary merged to create the hot subdwarf.

to vary with ecliptic latitude and solar cycle. We found that the observed
oxygen intensities generally decrease from solar maximum to solar minimum, both
at high ecliptic latitudes (as expected) and at low ecliptic latitudes (not as
expected). The geocoronal SWCX intensity is expected to depend on the solar
wind proton flux and on the sightline's path through the magnetosheath. The
intensity variations seen in directions that have been observed multiple times
are in poor agreement with the predictions of a geocoronal SWCX model. The
oxygen lines account for ~40-50% of the 3/4 keV X-ray background that is not
due to unresolved AGN, in good agreement with a previous measurement. However,
this fraction is not easily explained by a combination of SWCX emission and
emission from hot plasma in the halo. The line intensities tend to increase
with longitude toward the inner Galaxy, possibly due to an increase in the
supernova rate in that direction or the presence of a halo of accreted material
centered on the Galactic Center. The variation of intensity with Galactic
latitude differs in different octants of the sky, and cannot be explained by a
single simple plane-parallel or constant-intensity halo model. (Abridged)

vector (spin-dependent) interactions and iso-spin violating couplings. Should a
signal of dark matter production be observed, this process can also help
disentangle the dark matter couplings to up- and down-type quarks.

z~4-6 located in the GOODS-S field that have high quality imaging from HST and
Spitzer. We have derived stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) through
stellar population modeling of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We
estimate the dust extinction from the observed UV colors. In the SED fitting
process we have studied the effects of assuming a star formation history (SFH)
both with constant SFR and one where the SFR rises exponentially with time. The
latter SFH is chosen to match the observed evolution of the UV luminosity
function. We find that neither the mean SFRs nor the mean stellar masses change
significantly when the rising SFR (RSF) model is assumed instead of the
constant SFR model. When focusing on galaxies with Mstar ~ 5x10^9 Msun, we find
that the sSFR evolves weakly with redshift (sSFR(z) \propto (1+z)^(0.6+/-0.1)
Gyr^-1), consistent with previous results and with recent estimates of the sSFR
at z~2-3 using similar assumptions. We have also investigated the impact of
optical emission lines on our results. We estimate that the contribution of
emission lines to the rest-frame optical fluxes is only modest at z~4 and 5 but
it could reach ~50% at z~6. When emission lines of this strength are taken into
account, the sSFR shows somewhat higher values at high redshifts, according to
the relation sSFR(z) \propto (1+z)^(1.0+/-0.1) Gyr^-1, i.e., ~2.3x higher at
z~6 than at z~2. However, the observed evolution is substantially weaker than
that found at z<2 or that expected from current models (which corresponds to
sSFR(z) \propto (1+z)^(2.5) Gyr^-1). -abridged-

Accurate stellar mass surface density profiles have been measured for the first
time for a complete sample of high-redshift galaxies more massive than 10^10.7
M_sun. The key advantage of this study compared to previous work is that the
surface brightness profiles are deconvolved for PSF smoothing, allowing
accurate measurements of the structure of the galaxies. The surface brightness
profiles account for contributions from complex galaxy structures such as rings
and faint outer disks. Mass profiles are derived using radial rest-frame u-g
color profiles and a well-established empirical relation between these colors
and the stellar mass-to-light ratio. We derive stellar half-mass radii from the
mass profiles, and find that these are on average ~25% smaller than rest-frame
g band half-light radii. This average size difference of 25% is the same at all
redshifts, and does not correlate with stellar mass, specific star formation
rate, effective surface density, Sersic index, or galaxy size. Although on
average the difference between half-mass size and half-light size is modest,
for approximately 10% of massive galaxies this difference is more than a factor
two. These extreme galaxies are mostly extended, disk-like systems with large
central bulges. These results are robust, but could be impacted if the central
dust extinction becomes high. ALMA observations can be used to explore this

redshift galaxies with measurements of the z~0 relation between gas-phase
metallicity, stellar mass, and star formation rate to make an explicit and
completely empirical connection between near-field and distant galaxy
observations. Our approach relies on two basic assumptions: 1) galaxies'
average paths through time in stellar mass vs. star formation rate space are
represented by a family of smooth functions that are determined by the
galaxies' final stellar mass, and 2) galaxies grow and become enriched with
heavy elements such that they always evolve along the mass--metallicity--star
formation rate relation. By integrating over these paths, we can track the
chemical evolution of stars in galaxies in a model independent way, without the
need for explicit assumptions about gas inflow, outflow, or star formation
efficiency. Using this approach, we present predictions of stellar metallicity
(i.e., O/H) distribution functions for present day star-forming galaxies of
different stellar masses and the evolution of the alpha-element stellar
metallicity-mass relation since z~1. The metallicity distribution functions are
fairly well described as Gaussians, truncated at high metallicity, with
power-law tails to low metallicity. We find that the stellar metallicity
distribution for Milky Way mass galaxies is in reasonable agreement with
observations for our Galaxy, and that the predicted stellar mass vs. mean
stellar metallicity relation at z=0 agrees quite well with results derived from
galaxy surveys. This validates the assumptions that are implicit in our simple
approach. Upcoming observations will further test these assumptions and their
range of validity, by measuring the mean stellar mass-metallicity relation up

appears to increase as a function of stellar mass. However, this result depends
on the ability to accurately measure the masses of evolved stars. Recently,
Lloyd (2011) called into question the masses of subgiant stars targeted by
Doppler surveys. Lloyd argues that very few observable subgiants have masses
greater than 1.5 Msun, and that most of them have masses in the range 1.0-1.2
Msun. To investigate this claim, we use Galactic stellar population models to
generate an all-sky distribution of stars. We incorporate the effects that make
massive subgiants less numerous, such as the initial mass function and
differences in stellar evolution timescales. We find that these effects lead to
negligibly small systematic errors in stellar mass estimates, in contrast to
the roughly 50% errors predicted by Lloyd. Additionally, our simulated target
sample does in fact include a significant fraction of stars with masses greater
than 1.5 Msun, primarily because the inclusion of an apparent magnitude limit
results in a Malmquist-like bias toward more massive stars, in contrast to the
volume-limited simulations of Lloyd. The magnitude limit shifts the mean of our
simulated distribution toward higher masses and results in a relatively smaller
number of evolved stars with masses in the range 1.0-1.2 Msun. We conclude
that, within the context of our present-day understanding of stellar structure
and evolution, many of the subgiants observed in Doppler surveys are indeed as
massive as main-sequence A stars.

advantage of easing computational burdens compared to solving the two sets of
penalized equations simultaneously. HPGEE2 with a smoothly clipped absolute

The empirical performance of the proposed HPGEE2 is demonstrated through

In one-dimensional (1D) lattices, the thermodynamic model becomes a coupled
Potts model with a bonding interaction that increases with the site matching
traits. We analytically calculate thermodynamic and critical properties for a
1D system and show that an order-disorder phase transition only occurs at T = 0
independent of the number of cultural traits q and features F. The 1D
thermodynamic Axelrod model belongs to the same universality class of the Ising
and Potts models, notwithstanding the increase of the internal dimension of the
local degree of freedom and the state-dependent bonding interaction. We suggest
a unifying proposal to compare exponents across different discrete 1D models.
The comparison with our Hamiltonian description reveals that in the
thermodynamic limit the original out-of-equilibrium 1D Axelrod model with noise
behaves like an ordinary thermodynamic 1D interacting particle system.

Different interpretations of photoemission data disagree on the evolution of
the pairing gap and different estimates of the upper critical field Hc2 are in
sharp contradiction. Here we resolve this contradiction by showing that
superconducting fluctuations in the underdoped cuprate Eu-LSCO, measured via
the Nernst effect, have a characteristic field scale that falls with
underdoping. The critical field Hc2 dips at p = 0.11, showing that
superconductivity is weak where stripe order is strong. In the archetypal
cuprate superconductor YBCO, Hc2 extracted from other measurements has the same
doping dependence, also with a minimum at p = 0.11, again where stripe order is
present. We conclude that competing states such as stripe order weaken
superconductivity and this, rather than phase fluctuations, causes Tc to fall
as cuprates become underdoped.

new modeling and optimization on a new Riemannian manifold of parameterized
regions.
  Joint dynamic shape and appearance models, in which a template of the object
is propagated to match the object shape and radiance in the next frame, are
advantageous over methods employing global image statistics in cases of complex
object radiance and cluttered background. In cases of 3D object motion and
viewpoint change, self-occlusions and dis-occlusions of the object are
prominent, and current methods employing joint shape and appearance models are
unable to adapt to new shape and appearance information, leading to inaccurate
shape detection. In this work, we model self-occlusions and dis-occlusions in a
joint shape and appearance tracking framework.
  Self-occlusions and the warp to propagate the template are coupled, thus a
joint problem is formulated. We derive a coarse-to-fine optimization scheme,
advantageous in object tracking, that initially perturbs the template by coarse
perturbations before transitioning to finer-scale perturbations, traversing all
scales, seamlessly and automatically. The scheme is a gradient descent on a
novel infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold that we introduce. The manifold
consists of planar parameterized regions, and the metric that we introduce is a
novel Sobolev-type metric defined on infinitesimal vector fields on regions.
The metric has the property of resulting in a gradient descent that
automatically favors coarse-scale deformations (when they reduce the energy)
before moving to finer-scale deformations.
  Experiments on video exhibiting occlusion/dis-occlusion, complex radiance and
background show that occlusion/dis-occlusion modeling leads to superior shape
accuracy compared to recent methods employing joint shape/appearance models or
employing global statistics.

genetic factors with small effects on susceptibility to disease. These small
effects are difficult to map reliably in genetic association studies. To
address this problem, researchers have developed methods that aggregate
information over sets of related genes, such as biological pathways, to
identify gene sets that are enriched for genetic variants associated with
disease. However, these methods fail to answer a key question: which genes and
genetic variants are associated with disease risk? We develop a method based on
sparse multiple regression that simultaneously identifies enriched pathways,
and prioritizes the variants within these pathways, to locate additional
variants associated with disease susceptibility. A central feature of our
approach is an estimate of the strength of enrichment, which yields a coherent
way to prioritize variants in enriched pathways. We illustrate the benefits of
our approach in a genome-wide association study of Crohn's disease with
~440,000 genetic variants genotyped for ~4700 study subjects. We obtain strong
support for enrichment of IL-12, IL-23 and other cytokine signaling pathways.
Furthermore, prioritizing variants in these enriched pathways yields support
for additional disease-association variants, all of which have been
independently reported in other case-control studies for Crohn's disease.

The model image of the quasar 1924-292 was obtained with four telescopes at
three observatories: the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) on Mauna Kea in
Hawaii, the Arizona Radio Observatory's Submillimeter Telescope (SMT) in
Arizona, and two telescopes of the Combined Array for Research in
Millimeterwave Astronomy (CARMA) in California in April 2009. With the greatly
improved resolution compared with previous observations and robust closure
phase measurement, the inner jet structure of 1924-292 was spatially resolved.
The inner jet extends to the northwest along a position angle of $-53^\circ$ at
a distance of 0.38\,mas from the tentatively identified core, in agreement with
the inner jet structure inferred from lower frequencies, and making a position
angle difference of $\sim 80^{\circ}$ with respect to the cm-jet. The size of
the compact core is 0.15\,pc with a brightness temperature of
$1.2\times10^{11}$\,K. Compared with those measured at lower frequencies, the
low brightness temperature may argue in favor of the decelerating jet model or
particle-cascade models. The successful measurement of closure phase paves the
way for imaging and time resolving Sgr A* and nearby AGN with the Event Horizon
Telescope.

Spicules are an important feature of the chromosphere, connecting the
photosphere to the corona, potentially mediating the transfer of energy and
mass. The aim of this work is to study the properties of spicules over
different regions of the sun. Our goal is to investigate if there is more than
one type of spicules, and how spicules behave in the quiet sun, coronal holes,
and active regions. We make use of high-cadence and high-spatial resolution Ca
II H observations taken by Hinode/SOT. Making use of a semi-automated detection
algorithm, we self-consistently track and measure the properties of 519
spicules over different regions. We find clear evidence of two types of
spicules. Type I spicules show a rise and fall and have typical lifetimes of
150-400 s and maximum ascending velocities of 15-40 km/s, while type II
spicules have shorter lifetimes of 50-150 s, faster velocities of 30-110 km/s,
and are not seen to fall down, but rather fade at around their maximum length.
Type II spicules are the most common, seen in quiet sun and coronal holes. Type
I spicules are seen mostly in active regions. There are regional differences
between quiet sun and coronal hole spicules, likely attributable to the
different field configurations. The properties of type II spicules are
consistent with published results of Rapid Blueshifted Events (RBEs),
supporting the hypothesis that RBEs are their disk counterparts. For type I
spicules we find the relations between their properties to be consistent with a
magnetoacoustic shock wave driver, and with dynamic fibrils as their disk
counterpart. The driver of type II spicules remains unclear from limb
observations.

structure is unstable at low temperature and/or high pressure. The 'cubic'
structure reflects the symmetry at high (room) temperature where the hydrogen
bond network is disordered and the hydrogen molecules are orientationally
disordered due to thermal rotation. In this sense, the 'cubic' symmetry would
definitely be lowered at low temperature where the hydrogen bond network and
the hydrogen molecules are expected to be ordered. At room temperature and
below 30 GPa, it is the thermal effects that play an essential role in
stabilizing the structure in 'cubic' symmetry. Above 60 GPa, the hydrogen bonds
in the framework would be symmetrized and the hydrogen bond order-disorder
transition would disappear. These results also suggest the phase behavior of
other filled-ice hydrates. In the case of rare gas hydrate, there would be no
guest molecues rotation-nonrotation transition since the guest molecules keep
their spherical symmetry at any temperature. On the contrary methane hydrate
MH-III would show complex transitions due to the lower symmetry of the guest
molecule. These results would encourage further experimental studies,

phase are almost unaffected by the introduction of a network. Measurement of
decorrelation times in the stable phase allow us to determine the critical

end of the day, after a roller-coaster ride of winning and losing, with his
dollar still intact, or maybe even with two dollars. But what the gambler loses
the moment he places his first bet is position. He exchanges one distribution
of money for a distribution of lesser quality, from which he cannot return. Our
first discussion in this work connects known results of economic inequality and
majorization to the probability theory of gambling and Martingales. We provide
a simple proof that fair gambles cannot increase the Lorenz curve, and we also
constructively demonstrate that any sequence of non-increasing Lorenz curves
corresponds to at least one Martingale.
  We next consider the efficiency of gambles. If all fair gambles are available
then one can move down the lattice of distributions defined by the Lorenz
ordering. However, the step from one distribution to the next is not unique. Is
there a sense of efficiency with which one can move down the Lorenz stream? One
approach would be to minimize the average total volume of money placed on the
table. In this case, it turns out that implementing part of the strategy using
private randomness can help reduce the need for the casino's randomness,
resulting in less money on the table that the casino cannot get its hands on.

theoretical models imply HI fractions as large as 40-90 per cent may be

spectra of high-redshift (z~6-7) quasars, we demonstrate that the opacity of
the intervening IGM redward of rest-frame Ly-a can rise rapidly in average
regions of the Universe simply because of the increasing incidence of
absorption systems which are optically thick to Lyman continuum photons as the
tail-end of reionisation is approached. Our simulations suggest these data do
not require a large change in the IGM neutral fraction by several tens of per

tau functions. They are obtained from reducing the Hirota bilinear equations
that describe the relation between certain points in the 3 component polynomial
KP Grassmannian. In this way we obtain transformations that act on the root
lattice of sl(6). We also show that this sl(6) root lattice can be related to
the $F_4^{(1)}$ root lattice. We thus obtain B\""acklund transformations that

Alternatively, the presence of nitrogen may be the result of past interactions

2,947 days. Here we revisit the topic of the dynamical status of this
remarkable object as well as look into its dynamical past and explore its
future orbital evolution which is driven by close encounters with both the
Earth-Moon system and Mercury. In our calculations we use a Hermite integration
scheme, the most updated ephemerides and include the perturbations by the eight
major planets, the Moon and the three largest asteroids. We confirm that 2002
VE68 currently is a quasi-satellite of Venus and it has remained as such for at
least 7,000 yr after a close fly-by with the Earth. Prior to that encounter the
object may have already been co-orbital with Venus or moving in a classical,
non-resonant Near-Earth Object (NEO) orbit. The object drifted into the
quasi-satellite phase from an L4 Trojan state. We also confirm that, at
aphelion, dangerously close encounters with the Earth (under 0.002 AU, well
inside the Hill sphere) are possible. We find that 2002 VE68 will remain as a
quasi-satellite of Venus for about 500 yr more and its dynamical evolution is
controlled not only by the Earth, with a non-negligible contribution from the
Moon, but by Mercury as well. 2002 VE68 exhibits resonant (or near resonant)
behavior with Mercury, Venus and the Earth. Our calculations indicate that an
actual collision with the Earth during the next 10,000 yr is highly unlikely
but encounters as close as 0.04 AU occur with a periodicity of 8 years.

PT-symmetric quantum systems is investigated. We show that they emerge from a
limit of band-edge states in a doubly periodic finite gap system when the
imaginary period tends to infinity. In this limit, the energy gaps are
contracted and disappear, every pair of band states of the same periodicity at
the edges of a gap coalesces and transforms into a singlet state in the
continuum. As a result, these spectral singularities turn out to be analogous
to those in the non-periodic systems, where they appear as zero-width

spectral singularities in the class of periodic systems we study are
transformed into exceptional points. The specific degeneration related to the
presence of finite number of spectral singularities and exceptional points is
shown to be coherently reflected by a hidden, bosonized nonlinear
supersymmetry.

Two experimental examples are presented: the self-propelled motion of a liquid

motion of a droplet, we introduce an experiment in which a droplet of aniline
sitting on an aqueous layer moves spontaneously at an air-water interface. The
spontaneous symmetry breaking of Marangoni-driven spreading causes regular
motion. In a circular Petri dish, the droplet exhibits either beeline motion or
circular motion. On the other hand, we show the emergence of a dynamic
labyrinthine pattern caused by dewetting of a metastable thin film from the
air-water interface. The contact line between the organic phase and aqueous
phase forms a unique spatio-temporal pattern characterized as a dynamic
labyrinthine. Motion of the contact line is controlled by diffusion processes.

similarities over a wide range of scales, from mesoscopic vortex structures in
microbial suspensions and motility assays of biopolymers to turbulent
large-scale instabilities in flocks of birds or schools of fish. Here, we argue
that, in many cases, the phenomenology of such active states can be efficiently
described in terms of fourth- and higher-order partial differential equations.
Structural transitions in these models can be interpreted as Landau-type
kinematic transitions in Fourier (wavenumber) space, suggesting that
microscopically different biological systems can share universal
long-wavelength features. This general idea is illustrated through numerical
simulations for two classes of continuum models for incompressible active
fluids: a Swift-Hohenberg-type scalar field theory, and a minimal vector model
that extends the classical Toner-Tu theory and appears to be a promising
candidate for the quantitive description of dense bacterial suspensions. We
also discuss briefly how microscopic symmetry-breaking mechanisms can enter
macroscopic continuum descriptions of collective microbial motion near surfaces
and conclude by outlining future applications.

semidiscretizations (including the Gauss--Legendre methods) applied to a class
of semilinear Hamiltonian PDEs which are well-posed on spaces of analytic
functions with analytic initial data can be embedded into a modified
Hamiltonian flow up to an exponentially small error. As a consequence, such
time-semidiscretizations conserve the modified Hamiltonian up to an
exponentially small error. The modified Hamiltonian is $O(h^p)$-close to the
original energy where $p$ is the order of the method and $h$ the time
step-size. Examples of such systems are the semilinear wave equation or the
nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with analytic nonlinearity and periodic
boundary conditions. Standard Hamiltonian interpolation results do not apply
here because of the occurrence of unbounded operators in the construction of
the modified vector field. This loss of regularity in the construction can be
taken care of by projecting the PDE to a subspace where the operators occurring
in the evolution equation are bounded and by coupling the number of excited
modes as well as the number of terms in the expansion of the modified vector
field with the step size. This way we obtain exponential estimates of the form
$O(\exp(-c/h^{1/(1+q)}))$ with $c>0$ and $q \geq 0$; for the semilinear wave
equation, $q=1$, and for the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation, $q=2$. We give

actions. They are anonymous and can not be distinguished by their appearances
and do not have common coordinate system or chirality. The robots do not
communicate through message passing. In the proposed gathering algorithm one
robot moves at a time towards its destination. The robot which moves, is
selected in such a way that, it will be the only robot eligible to move, until
it reaches its destination. In case of a tie, this paper proposes a leader
election algorithm which produces an ordering of the robots and the first robot
in the ordering becomes the leader. The ordering is unique in the sense that,
each robot, characterized by its location, agrees on the same ordering. We show
that if a set of robots can be ordered then they can gather deterministically.
The paper also characterizes the cases, where ordering is not possible. This
paper also presents an important fact that, if leader election is possible then

star--forming clouds under the influence of internal ionizing feedback from
massive stars across a spectrum of cloud properties. We infer which objects are
triggered by comparing our feedback simulations with control simulations in
which no feedback was present. We find feedback always results in a lower
star--formation efficiency and usually but not always results in a larger
number of stars or clusters. Cluster mass functions are not strongly affected
by feedback, but stellar mass functions are biased towards lower masses.
Ionization also affects the geometrical distribution of stars in ways that are
robust against projection effects, but may make the stellar associations more
or less subclustered depending on the background cloud environment. We observe
a prominent pillar in one simulation which is the remains of an accretion flow
feeding the central ionizing cluster of its host cloud and suggest that this
may be a general formation mechanism for pillars such as those observed in M16.
We find that the association of stars with structures in the gas such as shells
or pillars is a good but by no means foolproof indication that those stars have
been triggered and we conclude overall that it is very difficult to deduce
which objects have been induced to form and which formed spontaneously simply
from observing the system at a single time.

Thus, this is the first detection of the 232 GHz vibrationally excited H2O

concentrated at the position of the radio Source I, which is remarkably
different from other molecular lines. The spectrum shows a double-peak

consistent with the 22 GHz H2O masers and 43 GHz SiO masers observed around
Source I. Thus, the 232 GHz H2O maser around Source I would be excited by the
internal heating by an embedded protostar, being associated with either the
root of the outflows/jets or the circumstellar disk around Source I, as traced
by the 22 GHz H2O masers or 43 GHz SiO masers, respectively.

efficient sensing techniques becomes critical. Recently, Compressed Sampling
(CS) techniques, which exploit the sparsity of signals, have allowed to
reconstruct signal and images with less measurements than the traditional
Nyquist sensing approach. However, multichannel signals like Hyperspectral
images (HSI) have additional structures, like inter-channel correlations, that
are not taken into account in the classical CS scheme. In this paper we exploit
the linear mixture of sources model, that is the assumption that the
multichannel signal is composed of a linear combination of sources, each of
them having its own spectral signature, and propose new sampling schemes
exploiting this model to considerably decrease the number of measurements
needed for the acquisition and source separation. Moreover, we give theoretical
lower bounds on the number of measurements required to perform reconstruction
of both the multichannel signal and its sources. We also proposed optimization
algorithms and extensive experimentation on our target application which is
HSI, and show that our approach recovers HSI with far less measurements and

primary and secondary users. In order to alleviate the negative effects of
misdetection and false alarm probabilities, a novel design of spectrum access
mechanism is proposed. We propose two schemes. First, the SU senses primary
channel to exploit the periods of silence, if the PU is declared to be idle,
the SU randomly accesses the channel with some access probability $a_s$.
Second, in addition to accessing the channel if the PU is idle, the SU possibly
accesses the channel if it is declared to be busy with some access probability
$b_s$. The access probabilities as function of the misdetection, false alarm
and average primary arrival rate are obtained via solving an optimization
problem designed to maximize the secondary service rate given a constraint on
primary queue stability. In addition, we propose a variable sensing duration
schemes where the SU optimizes over the optimal sensing time to achieve the
maximum stable throughput of the network. The results reveal the performance
gains of the proposed schemes over the conventional sensing scheme. We propose
a method to estimate the mean arrival rate and the outage probability of the PU

  in PODS'13. The merged article can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2815",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Let P be a set of n points in R^2. Given a rectangle Q = [\alpha_1, \alpha_2]
x [\beta_1, \beta_2], a range skyline query returns the maxima of the points in
P \cap Q. An important variant is the so-called top-open queries, where Q is a
3-sided rectangle whose upper edge is grounded at y = \infty (that is, \beta_2
= \infty). These queries are crucial in numerous database applications. In
internal memory, extensive research has been devoted to designing data
structures that can answer such queries efficiently. In contrast, currently
there is no clear understanding about their exact complexities in external
memory.
  This paper presents several structures of linear size for answering the above
queries with the optimal I/O cost. We show that a top-open query can be solved
in O(log_B(n) + k/B) I/Os, where B is the block size and k is the number of
points in the query result. The query cost can be made O(log log_B(U) + k/B)
when the data points lie in a U x U grid for some integer U >= n, and further
lowered to O(1 + k/B) if U = O(n). The same efficiency also applies to 3-sided
queries where Q is a right-open rectangle. However, the hardness of the problem
increases if Q is a left- or bottom-open 3-sided rectangle. We prove that any
linear-size structure must perform \Omega((n/B)^\eps + k/B) I/Os to solve such
a query in the worst case, where \eps > 0 can be an arbitrarily small constant.
In fact, left- and right-open queries are just as difficult as general
(4-sided) queries, for which we give a linear-size structure with query time
O((n/B)^\eps + k/B). Interestingly, this indicates that 4-sided range skyline
queries have exactly the same hardness as 4-sided range reporting (where the
goal is to report simply the whole P \cap Q). That is, the skyline requirement
does not alter the problem difficulty at all.

spectral line maps of the 12/13CO(2-1) transitions as well as a NIR extinction
map were added to the analysis. We employed a ray-tracing algorithm to derive
the 2D mid-plane dust temperature and volume density distribution without
suffering from LoS averaging effects of simple SED fitting procedures.
Additional 3D radiative transfer calculations were employed to investigate the
connection between the external irradiation and the peculiar crescent shaped
morphology found in the FIR maps. For the first time, we spatially resolve the
dust temperature and density distribution of B68. We find T_dust dropping from
16.7 K at the edge to 8.2 K in the centre, which is about 4 K lower than the
result of the simple SED fitting approach. N_H peaks at 4.3x10^22 cm^-2 and n_H
at 3.4x10^5 cm^-3 in the centre. B68 has a mass of 3.1 M_sun of material with
A_K > 0.2 mag for an assumed distance of 150 pc. We detect a compact source in
the southeastern trunk, which is also seen in extinction and CO. We find the
radial density distribution from the edge of the inner plateau outward to be
n_H ~ r^-3.5. Such a steep profile can arise from either or both of the
following: external irradiation with a significant UV contribution or the
fragmentation of filamentary structures. Our 3D radiative transfer model of an
externally irradiated core by an anisotropic ISRF reproduces the crescent
morphology. Our CO observations show that B68 is part of a chain of globules in
both space and velocity, which may indicate that it was once part of a filament
which dispersed. We also resolve a new compact source in the SE trunk and find
that it is slightly shifted in centroid velocity from B68, lending qualitative
support to core collision scenarios.

stellar-mass black hole outbursts. In contrast, compact, steady, relativistic
jets are detected in spectrally hard states that are dominated by non-thermal
X-ray emission. Although these distinctive outflows appear to be almost
mutually exclusive, it is possible that a disk wind persists in hard states but
cannot be detected via X-ray absorption lines owing to very high ionization.
Here, we present an analysis of a deep, 60 ksec Chandra/HETGS observation of
the black hole candidate H 1743-322 in the low/hard state. The spectrum shows
no evidence of a disk wind, with tight limits, and within the range of ionizing
flux levels that were measured in prior Chandra observations wherein a wind was
clearly detected. In H 1743-322, at least, disk winds are actually diminished
in the low/hard state, and disk winds and jets are likely state-dependent and
anti-correlated. These results suggest that although the launching radii of
winds and jets may differ by orders of magnitude, they may both be tied to a
fundamental property of the inner accretion flow, such as the mass accretion
rate and/or the magnetic field topology of the disk. We discuss these results
in the context of disk winds and jets in other stellar-mass black holes, and
possible launching mechanisms for black hole outflows.

intrinsic property of Maxwell equations in free space. This symmetry underlies
the conservation of optical helicity, and, as we show here, is closely related
to the separation of spin and orbital degrees of freedom of light (the helicity
flux coincides with the spin angular momentum). However, in the standard
field-theory formulation of electromagnetism, the field Lagrangian is not dual
symmetric. This leads to problematic dual-asymmetric forms of the canonical
energy-momentum, spin, and orbital angular momentum tensors. Moreover, we show
that the components of these tensors conflict with the helicity and energy
conservation laws. To resolve this discrepancy between the symmetries of the
Lagrangian and Maxwell equations, we put forward a dual-symmetric Lagrangian
formulation of classical electromagnetism. This dual electromagnetism preserves
the form of Maxwell equations, yields meaningful canonical energy-momentum and
angular momentum tensors, and ensures a self-consistent separation of the spin
and orbital degrees of freedom. This provides rigorous derivation of results
suggested in other recent approaches. We make the Noether analysis of the dual
symmetry and all the Poincar\'e symmetries, examine both local and integral
conserved quantities, and show that only the dual electromagnetism naturally
produces a complete self-consistent set of conservation laws. We also discuss
the observability of physical quantities distinguishing the standard and dual

turbulent eddies is known to be possible via the so-called $\alpha$ effect when
the turbulence is helical and if the domain is large enough for the $\alpha$
effect to dominate over turbulent diffusion. Using three-dimensional turbulence
simulations, we show that the energy of the resulting mean magnetic field of
the saturated state increases linearly with the product of normalized helicity
and the ratio of domain scale to eddy scale, provided this product exceeds a
critical value of around unity. This implies that large-scale dynamo action
commences when the normalized helicity is larger than the inverse scale ratio.
Our results show that the emergence of small-scale dynamo action does not have
any noticeable effect on the large-scale dynamo. Recent findings by Pietarila
Graham et al. (2012, Phys. Rev. E85, 066406) of a smaller minimal helicity may
be an artifact due to the onset of small-scale dynamo action at large magnetic
Reynolds numbers. However, the onset of large-scale dynamo action is difficult
to establish when the kinetic helicity is small. Instead of random forcing,
they used an ABC-flow with time-dependent phases. We show that such dynamos
saturate prematurely in a way that is reminiscent of inhomogeneous dynamos with
internal magnetic helicity fluxes. Furthermore, even for very low fractional
helicities, such dynamos display large-scale fields that change direction,
which is uncharacteristic of turbulent dynamos.

primary front is launched with an initial speed of $\sim$440 km s$^{-1}$. It
appears significant emission enhancement in the hotter channel but deep
emission reduction in the cooler channel. When the primary front encounters a
large coronal loop system and slows down, a secondary much fainter front
emanates from the primary front with a relatively higher starting speed of
$\sim$550 km s$^{-1}$. Afterwards the two fronts propagate independently with
increasing separation. The primary front finally stops at a magnetic
separatrix, while the secondary front travels farther before it fades out. In
addition, upon the arrival of the secondary front, transverse oscillations of a
prominence are triggered. We suggest that the two components are of different
natures. The primary front belongs to a non-wave coronal mass ejection (CME)
component, which can be reasonably explained with the field-line stretching
model. The multi-temperature behavior may be caused by considerable heating due
to the nonlinear adiabatic compression on the CME frontal loop. For the
secondary front, most probably it is a linear fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) wave that propagates through a medium of the typical coronal temperature.
X-ray and radio data provide us with complementary evidence in support of the
above scenario.

fluctuating velocity and temperature in compressible wall-bounded turbulent
flows. In particular, an exact analogy solution is derived for compressible
turbulent pipe and channel flows and an approximate analogy solution is derived
for compressible turbulent boundary layers (CTBL), both of which are
independent of fluid Prandtl number and wall temperature condition. The analogy
solutions are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulation data,
able to reproduce empirical relations, and can be viewed as extensions of
existing theories. In contrast to Walz's equation for adiabatic CTBL, the mean
temperature-velocity relation derived by GRA can be applied to different
wall-bounded flows in non-adiabatic wall condition, which is achieved by
extending Walz's adiabatic recovery factor to a heat flux dependent one. The
fluctuation temperature-velocity relations derived by GRA are slightly
different from the modified strong Reynolds analogy derived phenomenologically
by Huang et al. (HSRA), and have a better performance than HSRA. In addition,
several key quantities are introduced in GRA, including a general total
enthalpy (or temperature) and an adiabatic degree--a well-founded dimensionless
parameter for characterizing the wall-temperature effects in non-adiabatic
flows. The GRA unveils the universal feature behind the complex nonlinear
couplings between the thermal and velocity fields, and makes possible of
predicting the mean fields of compressible wall-bounded turbulence with the
information of the corresponding incompressible flow.

interpreted here to imply that the lifetime of the e-p pair should be equal to
the Planck time. Concerning the title's subject, a perfect theory would require
that the true vacuum expectation value of the operator associated with pair
production, be compatible with the normalization of the true vacuum. At
present, a calculation of the vacuum energy based on Feynman diagrams reveals a
serious difficulty: if only second order terms of the S-matrix are retained,
and because there are no external lines, it follows that the space-time
integrations over the coordinates, involved in the calculation of the vacuum
expectation value of the S-matrix, give rise to two identical delta functions:
the amplitude is thus proportional to the space-time volume of integration, L4.
The square of the amplitude defies then any physically meaningful
interpretation. One is faced here with two evils: modify the interaction
Lagrangian so that the amplitude becomes proportional to L2, or abstain from
any calculation. It is felt that the first one is the lesser evil. If the
square of the amplitude is proportional to L4 (instead of L8), it, can be
interpreted as being the number, N, of events (pairs created), in the volume of
integration. In the calculations for N it was assumed that the integral over
momentums (rescaled to be dimensionless) was of the order unity, and that
processes with small virtual photon-energy are predominant. The pairs'
contribution to the vacuum density is then given by the mass of the particles
multiplied, by the number of events per unit volume and unit time, as well as,
by the pairs lifetime. It is found that the calculated value for the vacuum
density is in surprisingly good agreement with the observations.
