  with high order of accuracy",,,,,"math.NA physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the development of exponential methods for the robust time
discretization of space inhomogeneous Boltzmann equations in stiff regimes.
Compared to the space homogeneous case, or more in general to the case of
splitting based methods, studied in Dimarco Pareschi (SIAM J. Num. Anal. 2011)
a major difficulty is that the local Maxwellian equilibrium state is not
constant in a time step and thus needs a proper numerical treatment. We show
how to derive asymptotic preserving (AP) schemes of arbitrary order and in
particular using the Shu-Osher representation of Runge-Kutta methods we explore
the monotonicity properties of such schemes, like strong stability preserving
(SSP) and positivity preserving. Several numerical results confirm our
analysis.

describe a tensor network approach to characterize its emergent anyon model
and, in a chiral phase, also its gapless edge theory. First, a tensor network
representation of a complete, orthonormal set of ground states on a cylinder of
infinite length and finite width is obtained through numerical optimization.
Each of these ground states is argued to have a different anyonic flux
threading through the cylinder. In a chiral phase, the entanglement spectrum of
each ground state is seen to reveal a different sector of the corresponding
gapless edge theory. A quasi-orthogonal basis on the torus is then produced by
chopping off and reconnecting the tensor network representation on the
cylinder. Elaborating on the recent proposal of [Y. Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. B
85, 235151 (2012)], a rotation on the torus yields an alternative basis of
ground states and, through the computation of overlaps between bases, the
modular matrices S and U (containing the mutual and self statistics of the
different anyon species) are extracted. As an application, we study the
hard-core boson Haldane model by using the two-dimensional density matrix
renormalization group. A thorough characterization of the universal properties
of this lattice model, both in the bulk and at the edge, unambiguously shows
that its ground space realizes the \nu=1/2 bosonic Laughlin state.

best realization of an ideal inviscid Euler fluid. As expressed by d'Alembert's
famous paradox, an ideal fluid does not exert drag on bodies past which it
flows, or in other words, it does not exchange momentum with them. Also, the
flow of an ideal fluid does not dissipate kinetic energy. We study
experimentally whether these properties apply to the flow of superfluid 3He-B
in a rotating cylinder at low temperatures. It is found that ideal behavior is
broken by quantum turbulence, which leads to substantial energy dissipation, as
observed also earlier. Here we show that remarkably, nearly ideal behavior is
preserved with respect to the angular-momentum exchange between the superfluid
and its container, i.e., the drag almost disappears in the zero-temperature
limit. This mismatch between energy and angular-momentum transfer results in a
new physical situation where the proper description of wall-bounded quantum
turbulence requires two effective friction parameters, one for energy

cutoff is taken to infinity while maintaining stable results due to a
cutoff-dependent adjustment of counterterms. We have applied this
renormalization method in the non-perturbative calculation of phase-shifts for
nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering using chiral NN potentials up to
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N3LO). For lower partial waves, we find
that there is either no convergence with increasing order or, if convergence
occurs, the results do not always converge to the empirical values. For higher
partial waves, we always observe convergence to the empirical phase shifts
(except for the 3G5 state). Furthermore, no matter what the order is, one can
use only one or no counterterm per partial wave, creating a rather erratic
scheme of power counting that does not allow for a systematic order-by-order
improvement of the predictions. The conclusion is that infinite-cutoff
renormalization is inappropriate for chiral NN interactions, which should not
come as a surprise, since the chiral effective field theory, these interactions
are based upon, is designed for momenta below the chiral-symmetry breaking
scale of about 1 GeV. Therefore, this value for the hard scale should also be
perceived as the appropriate upper limit for the momentum cutoff.

In this paper, we provide evidence that, within the limits of the model
selection approach used to ascertain the presence of power law statistics, the

law. In contrast, the global lability of synchronisation measure is shown to
better discriminate critical from non critical interaction.

into a narrow band of frequencies at superhorizon scales. In this work we
numerically confirm this expectation. These gauge fields and currents, when
combined with the Friedmann equations, were broken into a system of hyperbolic

including the effects of the chiral anomaly for the axial vector current,
inflation ended satisfactorily after approximately 60 e-folds.

arranged in typical patterns which are observed as a variety of multiscale
magnetic patterns. High resolution magnetograms of quiet solar surface revealed
the presence of magnetic underdense regions in the solar photosphere, commonly
called voids, which may be considered a signature of the underlying convective
structure. The analysis of such patterns paves the way for the investigation of
all turbulent convective scales from granular to global. In order to address
the question of magnetic structures driven by turbulent convection at granular
and mesogranular scales we used a ""voids"" detection method. The computed voids
distribution shows an exponential behavior at scales between 2 and 10 Mm and
the absence of features at 5-10 Mm mesogranular scales. The absence of
preferred scales of organization in the 2-10 Mm range supports the multiscale
nature of flows on the solar surface and the absence of a mesogranular
convective scale.

the Tevatron data, the deviations can be explained by the extremely mixed stop
sector in the sense of best global fit (BGF). We analyze the relations among
the competing reduced coupling hGG, Higgs boson mass,and LHC stop mass m_{\wt
t_1} lower bound at the tree- and one-loop level. In particular, we point out
that we use the light stop running mass in the Higgs boson mass calculation
while the light stop pole mass in the Higgs decays. So the gluino radiative
correction on the light stop mass plays the crucial role. Its large negative
correction saves the GBF in the Minimal Supersymmetric SM (MSSM) and the next
to the MSSM (NMSSM) constrained by the perturbativity. Moreover, a light stop
is predicted: in the MSSM if we set the gluino mass M_3\lesssim4 TeV, we have
m_{\wt t_1}<m_t; while in the NMSSM, imposing the least tuning condition we get
m_{\wt t_1}\simeq130 GeV for M_3\simeq1.5 TeV.

formed with a general circulation model by varying the rotation rate {\Omega}
and the surface drag {\tau} in a wide parametric range. By using nonequilibrium
thermodynamics diagnostics such as material entropy production, efficiency,
meridional heat transport and kinetic energy dissipation we characterize in a
new way the different circulation regimes. Baroclinic circulations feature high
mechanical dissipation, meridional heat transport, material entropy pro-
duction and are fairly efficient in converting heat into mechanical work. The
thermal dissipation associated with the sensible heat flux is found to depend
mainly on the surface properties, almost independent from the rotation rate and
very low for quasi-barotropic circulations and regimes approaching equa- torial
super-rotation. Slowly rotating, axisymmetric circulations have the highest
meridional heat transport. At high rotation rates and intermediate- high drag,
atmospheric circulations are zonostrohic with very low mechanical dissipation,
meridional heat transport and efficiency. When {\tau} is interpreted as a
tunable parameter associated with the turbulent boundary layer trans- fer of
momentum and sensible heat, our results confirm the possibility of using the
Maximum Entropy Production Principle as a tuning guideline in the range of
values of {\Omega}. This study suggests the effectiveness of using fun-
damental nonequilibrium thermodynamics for investigating the properties of
planetary atmospheres and extends our knowledge of the thermodynamics of the

peak, found in the Fermi/LAT data, in terms of dark matter annihilation through
a dipole moment interaction. The annihilating dark matter particles represent a
subdominant component, with mass density 7-17% of the total DM density; and
they only annihilate into gamma gamma, gamma Z, and ZZ, through a magnetic (or
electric) dipole moment. Annihilation into other standard model particles is
suppressed, due to a mass splitting in the magnetic dipole case, or to p-wave
scattering in the electric dipole case. In either case, the observed signal
requires a dipole moment of strength mu ~ 2/TeV. We argue that composite models
are the preferred means of generating such a large dipole moment, and that the
magnetic case is more natural than the electric one. We present a simple model
involving a scalar and fermionic techniquark of a confining SU(2) gauge
symmetry. We point out some generic challenges for getting such a model to
work. The new physics leading to a sufficiently large dipole moment is below
the TeV scale, indicating that the magnetic moment is not a valid effective
operator for LHC physics, and that production of the strongly interacting
constituents, followed by techni-hadronization, is a more likely signature than
monophoton events. In particular, 4-photon events from the decays of bound

almost all the energy radiated in the mid-IR. The radius of the dust emission
is increasing as R\simt^(0.7+/-0.4) and the optical depth is dropping as
tau_V\simt^(-1.3+/-0.4). The evolution expected for an expanding shell of

This finding proves conclusively that the edge in the gamma-rays is real (and

the gamma-ray bubbles are indeed the same structure observed at multiple
wavelengths, and strongly supports the interpretation of the microwave haze as
a separate component of Galactic synchrotron (likely generated by a transient

synchrotron. In addition, combining these data sets allows for the first
determination of the magnetic field within a radio bubble using microwaves and
gamma-rays by taking advantage of the fact that the inverse Compton gamma-rays
are primarily generated by scattering of CMB photons at these latitudes, thus
minimizing uncertainty in the target radiation field. Assuming uniform volume

fields. Unfortunately, a closed, analytic expression for the pdf is not yet
known. As a first result of this work, an explicit analytic expression for the
density of the sum of two gamma random variables is derived. Then a
computationally efficient algorithm to numerically calculate the linear
combination of chi square random variables is developed. An explicit expression
for the error bound is obtained. The proposed technique is shown to be
computationally efficient, i.e. only polynomial in growth in the number of
terms compared to the exponential growth of most other methods. It provides a
vast improvement in accuracy and shows only logarithmic growth in the required
precision. In addition, it is applicable to a much greater number of terms and
currently the only way of computing the distribution for hundreds of terms. As
an application, the exponential dependence of the eigenvalue fluctuation
probability of a random matrix model for 4d supergravity with N scalar fields
is found to be of the asymptotic form exp(-0.35N).

only two effective operators, so that the rates in $Z\gamma$ and $WW^*$ are
predicted now that the rates in $\gamma\gamma$ and $ZZ^*,Z\gamma^* \to 4 \ell$
have been measured. We find that the pseudoscalar possibility is disfavored but
not conclusively excluded. Experimental exclusion of the $Z\gamma$ decay to
well below $\sigma/\sigma_{\rm SM} \sim 170$ or conclusive observation of the
$WW^*$ decay near the Standard Model rate would eliminate the pseudoscalar
possibility. The $Z\gamma$ exclusion should be possible using existing data.
The only loophole in our argument is the possibility that the $4\ell$ signal
comes from pseudoscalar decays to a pair of new neutral gauge bosons with mass
near the $Z$ pole.

nonzero only when there is more than one superconducting order parameter,

frequency-dependence of the Hall conductivity at a frequency close to the
inter-orbital hopping energy scale that describes hopping between Ru $d_{xz}$

impurity effects in the superconducting phase, would thus constitute compelling
evidence in favour of a multiband origin of superconductivity in $\Sr$, with
strong superconductivity on the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ bands. The temperature
dependence of the Hall conductivity and Kerr rotation angle are studied within

revisit the so-called halofit model (Smith et al. 2003) as an accurate fitting
formula for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. While the halofit model has
been frequently used as a standard cosmological tool to predict the nonlinear
matter power spectrum in a universe dominated by cold dark matter, its
precision has been limited by the low-resolution of $N$-body simulations used
to determine the fitting parameters, suggesting the necessity of improved
fitting formula at small scales for future cosmological studies. We run
high-resolution $N$-body simulations for 16 cosmological models around the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) best-fit cosmological parameters
(1, 3, 5, and 7 year results), including dark energy models with a constant
equation of state. The simulation results are used to re-calibrate the fitting
parameters of the halofit model so as to reproduce small-scale power spectra of
the $N$-body simulations, while keeping the precision at large scales. The
revised fitting formula provides an accurate prediction of the nonlinear matter
power spectrum in a wide range of wavenumber ($k \leq 30h$\,Mpc$^{-1}$) at
redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 10$, with 5% precision for $k\leq1 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at $0

$p_{\rm T}=7$ GeV/$c$, there is a significant rise in the nuclear modification
factor, which reaches $R_{\rm{AA}} \approx0.4$ for $p_{\rm T}>30$ GeV/$c$. In
peripheral collisions (70-80%), the suppression is weaker with $R_{\rm{AA}}

modification factors are compared to other measurements and model calculations.

system is tilted, asymmetric, warped and photoevaporated. The exquisite angular
resolution of ACS allows us to map the distribution of dust grains at the
northern translucent edge of the disk, dominated by the photoevaporative flow.
Using the Mie theory for standard circumstellar disk grains, we find evidence
for a spatial gradient in grain size. The typical dust radius, $\simeq 0.2-0.7
\mu$m (less than what reported by previous studies) becomes smaller as the
distance from the disk center increases, consistent with the expectations for
the dynamic of dust entrained in a gaseous photoevaporative wind. Our analysis
of the disk morphology and location within the nebula indicates that this
system is photoevaporated by the diffuse radiation field of the Orion Nebula,
while being shielded from the radiation coming directly from the central
Trapezium stars. We estimate the mass-loss rate from the disk surface and the
time-scale for total disk dissipation, which turns out to be of the order of
$10^4$yr. Such a short time, of the order of 1/100 of the cluster age,
indicates that this system is seen on the verge of destruction. This is
compatible with the exceptional nature of the disk, namely its combination of
huge size and low mass. Finally, we briefly discuss the viability of possible

incomparable with the parallel class NC which also satisfies NL \subseteq NC
\subseteq P, and note that this conjecture implies that none of the CC-complete
problems has an efficient polylog time parallel algorithm. We provide evidence
for our conjecture by giving oracle settings in which relativized CC and
relativized NC are incomparable.
  We give several alternative definitions of CC, including (among others) the
class of problems computed by uniform polynomial-size families of comparator
circuits supplied with copies of the input and its negation, the class of
problems AC^0-reducible to CCV, and the class of problems computed by uniform
AC^0 circuits with CCV gates. We also give a machine model for CC, which
corresponds to its characterization as log-space uniform polynomial-size
families of comparator circuits. These various characterizations show that CC
is a robust class. The main technical tool we employ is universal comparator

one gluon exchange interaction for the massless quarks has considerable effect
on the $QGP$ phase diagram and it causes the system to reach to the confined

and Friedrichs as $p(\rho) = \alpha \rho^ \gamma - \beta$ for consants $\gamma
>1$ and $ \alpha, \beta > 0$. The analysis is made difficult by two competing
nonlinearities associated with the potential energy: compression in the bulk,
and surface area dynamics on the free-boundary. Unlike the analysis of the
incompressible Euler equations, wherein boundary regularity controls regularity
in the interior, the compressible Euler equation require the additional
analysis of nonlinear wave equations generating sound waves. An existence
theory is developed by a specially chosen parabolic regularization together
with the vanishing viscosity method. The artificial parabolic term is chosen so
as to be asymptotically consistent with the Euler equations in the limit of
zero viscosity. Having solutions for the positive surface tension problem, we
proceed to obtain a priori estimates which are independent of the surface
tension parameter. This requires choosing initial data which satisfy the Taylor
sign condition. By passing to the limit of zero surface tension, we prove the
well-posedness of the compressible Euler system without surface on the

well as with residual scattering. It can be used to trace out the fermion
dispersion curves. However, this effect depends strongly on the linearity of
the Dirac dispersion. Should the Dirac fermions acquire a mass, the peak in
$\sigma(q,w)$ shifts to lower energies and broadens as optical spectral weight
is redistributed over an energy range of the order of the mass gap energy. Even

pseudoconvex hypersurface $M\subset \bC^{n+1}$ into a sphere $\bS$ in a higher
dimensional complex space $\bC^{N+1}$. The degeneracy of the mapping $f$ will
be characterized in terms of the ranks of the CR second fundamental form and
its covariant derivatives. In 2004, the author, together with X. Huang and D.
Zaitsev, established a rigidity result for CR embeddings $f$ into spheres in
low codimensions. A key step in the proof of this result was to show that
degenerate mappings are necessarily contained a complex plane section of the
target sphere (partial rigidity). In the 2004 paper, it was shown that if the
total rank $d$ of the second fundamental form and all of its covariant
derivatives is $<n$ (here, $n$ is the CR dimension of $M$), then $f(M)$ is
contained in a complex plane of dimension $n+d+1$. The converse of this
statement is also true, as is easy to see. When the rank $d$ exceeds $n$, it is
no longer true, in general, that $f(M)$ is contained in a complex plane of
dimension $n+d+1$, as can be seen by examples. In this paper, we carry out a
systematic study of degenerate CR mappings into spheres. We show that when the
ranks of the second fundamental form and its covariant derivatives exceed the
CR dimension $n$, then partial rigidity may still persist, but there is a
""defect"" $k$ that arises from the ranks exceeding $n$ such that $f(M)$ is only
contained in a complex plane of dimension $n+d+k+1$. Moreover, this defect
occurs in general, as is illustrated by examples.

loop level which requires a mechanism, e.g., a symmetry, to forbid the lower
order contributions. Here, we study in detail the conditions on this type of
symmetries. We put special emphasis on the discrete Z_n symmetries as a simple
example but our results can be also extended to more general groups. We find
that regardless of the details of the symmetry, in certain cases the existence
of a lower order contribution to neutrino masses can be determined by the
topology of the diagrams with a given number of loops. We discuss the lepton
flavor violating rare decays as well as (g-2)_\mu in this class of models,
which generically appear at the one loop level. Typically the imposed symmetry
has important implications for dark matter, with the possibility of stabilizing
one or even multiple dark matter candidates.

is concerned with the ability of such a detector to detect muons of the
opposite sign to those stored (wrong-sign muons) while suppressing
contamination of the signal from the interactions of other neutrino species in
the beam. A new more realistic simulation and analysis, which improves the
efficiency of this detector at low energies, has been developed using the GENIE
neutrino event generator and the GEANT4 simulation toolkit. Low energy neutrino
events down to 1 GeV were selected, while reducing backgrounds to the $10^{-4}$
level. Signal efficiency plateaus of ~60% for $\nu_\mu$ and ~70% for
$\bar{\nu}_\mu$ events were achieved starting at ~5 GeV. Contamination from the
$\nu_\mu\rightarrow \nu_\tau$ oscillation channel was studied for the first
time and was found to be at the level between 1% and 4%. Full response matrices
are supplied for all the signal and background channels from 1 GeV to 10 GeV.
The sensitivity of an experiment involving a MIND detector of 100 ktonnes at

oriented along the beam's direction of propagation and opposite to it,
respectively. The behavior of the acoustic radiation force generated by Bessel
beams when the sphere lies outside the beam's axis (off-axial configuration) is
unknown. Using the 3D radiation force formulas given in terms of the partial
wave expansion coefficients for the incident and scattered waves, both axial
and transverse components of the force exerted on a silicone-oil sphere are
obtained for a zero- and a first-order Bessel vortex beam. As the sphere
departs from the beam's axis, the tractor force becomes weaker. Moreover, the
behavior of the transverse radiation force field may vary with the sphere's
size factor $ka$ (where $k$ is the wavenumber and $a$ is the sphere radius).
Both stable and unstable equilibrium regions around the beam's axis are found
depending on $ka$ values. These results are particularly important for the
design of acoustical tractor beam devices operating with Bessel beams.

coupling in the presence of \emph{s}-wave pairing potentials (superconducting
proximity effect in semiconductors or superfluidity in cold atoms) are one of
the most promising systems for the developing of topological phases hosting
Majorana fermions. The breaking of time-reversal symmetry is essential for the
appearance of unpaired Majorana fermions. By implementing a
\emph{time-dependent} spin rotation, we show that the standard magnetostatic
model maps into a \emph{non-magnetic} one where the breaking of time-reversal
symmetry is guaranteed by a periodical change of the spin-orbit coupling axis
as a function of time. This suggests the possibility of developing the
topological superconducting state of matter driven by external forces in the
absence of magnetic fields and magnetic elements. From a practical viewpoint,
the scheme avoids the disadvantages of conjugating magnetism and

basic properties of this Floquet system by showing that finite samples host
unpaired Majorana fermions at their edges despite the fact that the bulk
Floquet quasienergies are gapless and that the Hamiltonian at each instant of
time preserves time-reversal symmetry. Remarkably, we identify the mean energy

(hide), whose main effect is to restrict the access to the object of the
communication, thus representing confidentiality in a natural way. The hide
operator is meant for local communication, and it differs from new in that it
forbids the extrusion of the name and hence has a static scope. Consequently, a
communication channel in the scope of a hide can be implemented as a dedicated
channel, and it is more secure than one in the scope of a new. To emphasize the
difference, we introduce a spy context that represents a side-channel attack
and breaks some of the standard security equations for new. To formally reason
on the security guarantees provided by the hide construct, we introduce an
observational theory and establish stronger equivalences by relying on a proof
technique based on bisimulation semantics.

promising to reduce this gap by providing an abstract specification language
which is asynchronously distributable. Classical process semantics establish an
implicit order of actually independent actions, by means of an interleaving. So
does the semantics of the join-calculus. To capture such independent actions,
step-based semantics, e.g., as defined on Petri nets, are employed. Our Petri

using the PANIC instrument on the 6.5-meter Magellan telescope and the WHIRC
instrument on the 3.5-meter WIYN telescope respectively. Both sources are
members of the class of faint to very-faint X-ray binaries and undergo very
long X-ray outburst, hence classified as `quasi persistent X-ray binaries'.
While XMMU J174716.1-281048 was active for almost 12 years between 2003 and
2015, SAX J1806.5-2215 has been active for more than 5 years now since 2011.
From our observations, we identify two NIR stars consistent with the Chandra
X-ray error circle of XMMU J174716.1-281048. The comparison of our observations
with the UKIRT Galactic plane observations taken during the same outburst,
color-color diagram analysis and spectral energy distribution suggest that both
stars are probably a part of the field population and are likely high mass
stars. Hence possibly neither of the two stars is a true NIR counterpart. For
the faint X-ray binary SAX J1806.5-2215 during its current outburst, we
detected a NIR star in our K band WIYN observations consistent with its Chandra
error circle. The identified NIR star was not detected during the UKIRT
observations taken during its quiescent state. The comparison of two
observations suggest that there was an increase in flux by at least one
magnitude of the detected star during our observations, hence suggests the
detection of the likely counterpart of SAX J1806.5-2215.

from y=0.5 leads to a sudden increase in $T_c$, with a maximum $T_c$ ~40 K at
y=0.2. Using first principles calculations, the unsynthesized stoichiometric
y=0 and the substoichiometric y=0.5 compounds have been investigated. For the
50% Mg-doped phase (y=0.5), Sr2(Mg$_y$Ti$_{1-y}$)O3 layers are completely
insulating spacers between FeAs layers, leading to the fermiology such as that
found for other Fe pnictides. At y=0, representing a phase with metallic
Sr2TiO3 layers, the $\Gamma$-centered Fe-derived Fermi surfaces (FSs)
considerably shrink or disappear. Instead, three $\Gamma$-centered Ti FSs
appear, and in particular two of them have similar size, like in MgB2.
Interestingly, FSs have very low Fermi velocity in large fractions: the lowest
being 0.6$\times10^6$ cm/s. Furthermore, our fixed spin moment calculations
suggest the possibility of magnetic ordering, with magnetic Ti and nearly
nonmagnetic Fe ions. These results indicate a crucial role of
Sr2(Mg$_y$Ti$_{1-y}$)O3 layers in this superconductivity.

studied as a function of altitude and wavelength using stellar or solar
occultations, giving often unique constraints on the atmospheric composition.
For exoplanets, a transit yields a limb-integrated, wavelength-dependent
transmission spectrum of an atmosphere. When scattering haze and/or cloud
particles are present in the planetary atmosphere, the amount of transmitted
flux not only depends on the total optical thickness of the slant light path
that is probed, but also on the amount of forward-scattering by the scattering
particles. Here, we present results of calculations with a three-dimensional
Monte Carlo code that simulates the transmitted flux during occultations or
transits. For isotropically scattering particles, like gas molecules, the
transmitted flux appears to be well-described by the total atmospheric optical
thickness. Strongly forward-scattering particles, however, such as commonly
found in atmospheres of Solar System planets, can increase the transmitted flux
significantly. For exoplanets, such added flux can decrease the apparent radius
of the planet by several scale heights, which is comparable to predicted and
measured features in exoplanet transit spectra. We performed detailed
calculations for Titan's atmosphere between 2.0 and 2.8 micron and show that
haze and gas abundances will be underestimated by about 8% if
forward-scattering is ignored in the retrievals. At shorter wavelengths, errors
in the gas and haze abundances and in the spectral slope of the haze particles
can be several tens of percent, also for other Solar System planetary
atmospheres. We also find that the contribution of forward-scattering can be
fairly well described by modelling the atmosphere as a plane-parallel slab.

Statistical Theory in molecular systems. R. Landauer and C.H. Bennett showed
that a logical copy can be carried out in the limit of no dissipation if the
computation is performed sufficiently slowly. Structural and recent
single-molecule assays have provided dynamic details of polymerase machinery
with insight into information processing. We introduce a rigorous
characterization of Shannon Information in biomolecular systems and apply it to
DNA replication in the limit of no dissipation. Specifically, we devise an
equilibrium pathway in DNA replication to determine the entropy generated in
copying the information from a DNA template in the absence of friction. Both
the initial state, the free nucleotides randomly distributed in certain
concentrations, and the final state, a polymerized strand, are mesoscopic
equilibrium states for the nucleotide distribution. We use empirical stacking
free energies to calculate the probabilities of incorporation of the
nucleotides. The copied strand is, to first order of approximation, a state of
independent and non-indentically distributed random variables for which the
nucleotide that is incorporated by the polymerase at each step is dictated by
the template strand, and to second order of approximation, a state of
non-uniformly distributed random variables with nearest-neighbor interactions
for which the recognition of secondary structure by the polymerase in the
resultant double-stranded polymer determines the entropy of the replicated
strand. Two incorporation mechanisms arise naturally and their biological
meanings are explained. It is known that replication occurs far from
equilibrium and therefore the Shannon entropy here derived represents an upper
bound for replication to take place. Likewise, this entropy sets a universal
lower bound for the copying fidelity in replication.

explicit formulas for algebraic connections on a class of finitely generated

non-flat with trace of curvature equal to zero. We construct these formulas
using an idempotent matrix $M$ defining the module $E$. Such an idempotent
matrix $M$ is constructed from a ""projective basis"" $B$ defining the module
$E$. Associated to a projective basis $B$ for $E$ we construct a connection
$\nabla_B$. The curvature $R_{\nabla_B}$ of the connection $\nabla_B$ is given
by a Lie product: $R_{\nabla_B}(x,y):=[\nabla_B(x)(M), \nabla_B(y)(M)]$
involving the matrix $M$, and this Lie product is non-zero in general. Hence
the curvature formula indicates that most projective finite rank modules do not
have a flat algebraic connection. We also give an explicit formula for a
non-flat algebraic connection on the cotangent bundle $\Omega$ of the real
2-sphere. The cotangent bundle $\Omega$ is topologically non-trivial and it is
not clear if it has a flat algebraic connection. All higher Chern classes in
deRham cohomology are zero: $c_i(\Omega)=0$ for all $i \geq 1$. We relate the
construction to non-abelian extensions and a refined characteristic class
$c(\Omega)$ introduced in another paper on the subject. The class $c(\Omega)$
is defined using the connection $\nabla_B$ but it is independent of choice of
connection. The class $c(\Omega)$ is non-trivial and it is zero iff $\Omega$
has a flat algebraic connection and it refines the first Chern class
$c_1(\Omega)$ in deRham cohomology and Lie-Rinehart cohomology.

the Anderson model does not exist. Instead, processes associated with Hund's
rule both on $d$ and $\pi$ orbitals, which may be called ""the double Hund's
exchange mechanism"", turn out to play important roles and the sign of resultant
$J$ can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic depending on model
parameters because of competition among various processes. By taking account of
magnetic anisotropy due to spin-orbit interactions and comparing with
experimental results, it is indicated that $J$ is antiferromagnetic and of the
order of 100K.

the LAT telescope on the Fermi gamma-ray observatory, showing peak energies
around a few GeV. Current modelling proposes that the high energy emission
comes from outer magnetospheric gaps, however radiation from the equatorial
current sheet which separates the two magnetic hemispheres outside the light
cylinder has also been investigated. Aims. In this paper we discuss the region
right outside the light cylinder, or ""near wind"" zone. We investigate the
possibility that synchrotron radiation emitted by thermal populations in the
equatorial current sheet of the pulsar wind in this region can explain the
lightcurves and spectra observed by Fermi/LAT. Methods. We use analytical
estimates as well as detailed numerical computation to calculate the gamma-ray
luminosities, lightcurves and spectra of gamma-ray pulsars. Results. Many of
the characteristics of the gamma-ray pulsars observed by Fermi/LAT can be
reproduced by our model, most notably the position of these objects in the P -
Pdot diagram, and the range of gamma-ray luminosities. A testable result is a
sub-exponential cutoff with an index b = 0.35. We also predict the existence of
a population of pulsars with cutoff energies in the MeV range. These have
systematically lower spindown luminosities than the Fermi/LAT detected pulsars.
Conclusions. It is possible for relativistic populations of electrons and
positrons in the current sheet of a pulsar's wind right outside the light
cylinder to emit synchrotron radiation that peaks in the sub-GeV to GeV regime,
with gamma-ray efficiencies similar to those observed for the Fermi/LAT
pulsars.

evolves continuously upon cooling with a precursor behavior, typical of a

the bulk behavior and analyzed within a phenomenological model. Such an

beyond a critical threshold sigma_c =1/2, that separates discontinuous from

electromagnetic form factors are correctly recovered in the proper limits. The
sum of the GPDs H and E of 3He, at low momentum transfer, is largely dominated
by the neutron contribution, thanks to the unique spin structure of 3He. This

with the highest albedo and color variation of any asteroid we have observed so
far. Terrains rich in low albedo dark material (DM) have been identified using
Dawn Framing Camera (FC) 0.75 {\mu}m filter images in several geologic
settings: associated with impact craters (in the ejecta blanket material and/or
on the crater walls and rims); as flow-like deposits or rays commonly
associated with topographic highs; and as dark spots (likely secondary impacts)
nearby impact craters. This DM could be a relic of ancient volcanic activity or
exogenic in origin. We report that the majority of the spectra of DM are
similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites mixed with materials indigenous to
Vesta. Using high-resolution seven color images we compared DM color properties
(albedo, band depth) with laboratory measurements of possible analog materials.
Band depth and albedo of DM are identical to those of carbonaceous chondrite
xenolith-rich howardite Mt. Pratt (PRA) 04401. Laboratory mixtures of Murchison
CM2 carbonaceous chondrite and basaltic eucrite Millbillillie also show band
depth and albedo affinity to DM. Modeling of carbonaceous chondrite abundance
in DM (1-6 vol%) is consistent with howardite meteorites. We find no evidence
for large-scale volcanism (exposed dikes/pyroclastic falls) as the source of
DM. Our modeling efforts using impact crater scaling laws and numerical models
of ejecta reaccretion suggest the delivery and emplacement of this DM on Vesta
during the formation of the ~400 km Veneneia basin by a low-velocity (<2
km/sec) carbonaceous impactor. This discovery is important because it
strengthens the long-held idea that primitive bodies are the source of carbon
and probably volatiles in the early Solar System.

(SWNTs), it is necessary to solve such an important problem as the
immobilization of a target biomolecule on the nanotube surface. In this work,
the enzyme (glucose oxidase (GOX)) was immobilized on the surface of a nanotube
network, which was created by the deposition of nanotubes from their solution
in 1,2-dichlorobenzene by the spray method. 1-Pyrenebutanoic acid succinimide
ester (PSE) was used to form the molecular interface, the bifunctional molecule
of which provides the covalent binding with the enzyme shell, and its other
part (pyrene) is adsorbed onto the nanotube surface. First, the usage of such a
molecular interface leaves out the direct adsorption of the enzyme (in this
case, its activity decreases) onto the nanotube surface, and, second, it
ensures the enzyme localization near the nanotube. The comparison of the
resonance Raman (RR) spectrum of pristine nanotubes with their spectrum in the
PSE environment evidences the creation of a nanohybrid formed by an SWNT with a
PSE molecule which provides the further enzyme immobilization. As the RR
spectrum of an SWNT:PSE:GOX film does not essentially differ from that of
SWNT:PSE ones, this indicates that the molecular interface (PSE) isolates the
enzyme from nanotubes strongly enough. The efficient immobilization of GOX
along the carbon nanotubes due to PSE is confirmed with atom-force microscopy
images. The method of molecular dynamics allowed us to establish the structures
of SWNT:PSE:GOX created in the aqueous environment and to determine the
interaction energy between hybrid components. In addition, the conductivity of
the SWNT network with adsorbed PSE and GOX molecules is studied.

interactions of galaxies with the cluster environment. Both the high-velocity
tidal interactions and effects of ram pressure stripping by the intracluster

anomalies in the magnetic field structures of Virgo cluster spirals in order to
characterize a variety of effects and attribute them to different disturbing
agents. Six angularly large Virgo cluster spiral galaxies (NGC4192, NGC4302,
NGC4303, NGC4321, NGC4388, and NGC4535) were targets of a sensitive total power
and polarization study using the 100-m radio telescope in Effelsberg at 4.85GHz
and 8.35GHz (except for NGC4388 observed only at 4.85GHz, and NGC4535 observed
only at 8.35GHz). Magnetic field structures distorted to various extent are
found in all galaxies. Three galaxies (NGC4302, NGC4303, and NGC4321) show some
signs of possible tidal interactions, while NGC4388 and NGC4535 have very
likely experienced strong ram-pressure and shearing effects, respectively,
visible as distortions and asymmetries of polarized intensity distributions. As
in our previous study, even strongly perturbed galaxies closely follow the
radio-far-infrared correlation. In NGC4303 and NGC4321, we observe symmetric
spiral patterns of the magnetic field and in NGC4535 an asymmetric pattern.
Magnetic fields allow us to trace even weak interactions that are difficult to
detect with other observations. Our results show that the degree of distortions
of a galaxy is not a simple function of the distance to the cluster center but
reflects also the history of its interactions. The angle between the velocity
vector and the rotation vector of a galaxy may be a general parameter that
describes the level of distortions of galactic magnetic fields.

  Structures",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study the role non-adaptivity plays in maintaining dynamic
data structures. Roughly speaking, a data structure is non-adaptive if the
memory locations it reads and/or writes when processing a query or update
depend only on the query or update and not on the contents of previously read
cells. We study such non-adaptive data structures in the cell probe model. This
model is one of the least restrictive lower bound models and in particular,
cell probe lower bounds apply to data structures developed in the popular
word-RAM model. Unfortunately, this generality comes at a high cost: the
highest lower bound proved for any data structure problem is only
polylogarithmic. Our main result is to demonstrate that one can in fact obtain
polynomial cell probe lower bounds for non-adaptive data structures.
  To shed more light on the seemingly inherent polylogarithmic lower bound
barrier, we study several different notions of non-adaptivity and identify key
properties that must be dealt with if we are to prove polynomial lower bounds
without restrictions on the data structures.
  Finally, our results also unveil an interesting connection between data
structures and depth-2 circuits. This allows us to translate conjectured hard
data structure problems into good candidates for high circuit lower bounds; in
particular, in the area of linear circuits for linear operators. Building on
lower bound proofs for data structures in slightly more restrictive models, we
also present a number of properties of linear operators which we believe are
worth investigating in the realm of circuit lower bounds.

investigated theoretically by means of a computationally efficient scheme. The
procedure can be divided into two stages: study of magnetism and calculations
of structural properties. In the first stage, an Ising model is considered and
fractions of Fe moments which point up as a function of temperature are
determined. In the second stage, density-functional theory calculations are
performed to evaluate free energies of alloys in partially disordered local
moment states as a function of lattice constant for various temperatures.
Extensive tests of the scheme are carried out by comparing simulation results
for thermal expansion coefficients of Fe1-xNix with x = 0.35, 0.4, ..., 0.8,
Fe0.72Pt0.28, and Fe0.68Pd0.32 with measurements. The scheme is found to
perform well, at least qualitatively, throughout the whole spectrum of test
compounds. For example, the significant reduction of the thermal expansion
coefficient of Fe1-xNix as x decreases from 0.55 to 0.35 near room temperature,
which was discovered by Guillaume, is reliably reproduced. As a result of the

radio access technologies are witnessing increasing interest from network
providers and consumers alike. Energy efficiency in such networks has become an
important design consideration due to the limited battery life of mobile
terminals on one side, and the ever increasing operational expenses pertaining
to energy expenditure on the other. In this paper, we present a routing
protocol for multi-radio multi-hop wireless networks, which aims to achieve a
trade-off between energy consumption in the network and routing delay,
considering both the energy consumption at the devices and the link energy
costs. We also present optimum route-path selection strategies by defining a
utility function to minimize the energy consumption in the network while
maximizing the network lifetime. Using simulations, we verify the utility of
the route-path selection strategies and the efficiency of the energy aware
routing algorithm. It turns out that the proposed protocol is energy efficient
in terms of path selection, with a slight compromise in the end-to-end delay.

island different from all others. This difference is incorporated in the
magnetic moment (spin) of the ""imperfect"" island and several cases are studied,
including the special situation in which this distinct spin is zero (vacancy).
We have shown that the two extreme points of a malformed island behave like two
opposite magnetic charges. Then, the effective interaction between a pair of
Nambu monopoles with the deformed island is a problem involving four magnetic
charges (two pairs of opposite poles) and a string. We also sketch the
configuration of the field lines of these four charges to confirm this picture.
The influence of the string on this interaction decays rapidly with the string
distance from the defect.

study the behavior of the expansion of $\s_{1^n\times w}\cdot\s_{1^n\times u}$

to a broad distribution of rupture forces and end-to-end lengths in the

hierarchy in which the rupture of domain-domain interactions at high forces
(200 pN) liberates the unfolding of individual domains at low forces (100 pN).

of the biexponential fits to the distribution of unfolding dwell times under
force-clamp. Overall, FLNa 16-23 under a force of 100 pN is more compliant than
the linear FLNa 1-8. Since a physiological role of FLNa is to crosslink actin

investigated. It is shown that at long delay times the echo amplitude is
determined by a small subset of two level systems (TLS) having negligible
relaxation and decoherence because of their weak coupling to phonons. The echo
decay can then be described approximately by power law time dependencies with
different powers at times longer and shorter than the typical TLS relaxation
time. The theory is applied to recent measurements of two and three pulse
dipolar echo in borosilicate glass BK7 and provides a perfect data fit in the
broad time and temperature ranges under the assumption that there exist two TLS
relaxation mechanisms due to TLS-phonons and TLS-TLS interaction. This

Existing contributions to this problem have largely focused on the special case
of first-order functional autoregressive processes because of their technical
tractability and the current lack of advanced functional time series
methodology. It is shown here how standard multivariate prediction techniques
can be utilized in this context. The connection between functional and
multivariate predictions is made precise for the important case of vector and
functional autoregressions. The proposed method is easy to implement, making
use of existing statistical software packages, and may therefore be attractive
to a broader, possibly non-academic, audience. Its practical applicability is
enhanced through the introduction of a novel functional final prediction error
model selection criterion that allows for an automatic determination of the lag
structure and the dimensionality of the model. The usefulness of the proposed
methodology is demonstrated in a simulation study and an application to
environmental data, namely the prediction of daily pollution curves describing
the concentration of particulate matter in ambient air. It is found that the
proposed prediction method often significantly outperforms existing methods.

measured the surface brightness profiles in the five Sloan optical bands and in

finding two differentiated features: an innermost break radius at distances of

that the breaks might be a phenomena related to a threshold in the star

and mass. Consequently the most metal-poor galaxies in the local universe are
dwarf galaxies. Blue compact dwarfs and tidal dwarfs tend to deviate from the
metallicity-luminosity relation by being too metal-poor or too metal-rich for
their luminosity, respectively. A less pronounced offset separates dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) and dwarf irregular galaxies, making the former too
metal-rich for their luminosity, which indicates different formation conditions
for these two types of dwarfs. While environment (photo-evaporation through
local re-ionization by massive galaxies, tidal and ram pressure stripping)
govern the observed morphology-distance relation, intrinsic properties (in
particular total mass) play a decisive role in dwarf galaxy evolution with
respect to the time and duration of star formation and the amount of
enrichment. The metallicity distribution functions of nearby dwarfs can be
understood taking pre-enrichment, gas infall, and winds into account. Many
dwarfs show evidence for inhomogeneous, localized enrichment. Ultra-faint
dSphs, which may have formed their metal-poor stars at high redshift via H2
cooling, show an overabundance of metal-deficient stars as compared to the
(inner) Galactic halo, but may, along with classical dSphs, have contributed
significantly to the build-up of the outer halo. The abundance ratios measured
in the irregular Large Magellanic Cloud are consistent with the postulated
early accretion of irregulars to form the inner Galactic halo.

neutrino oscillation measurements. One experimental signature for these
oscillations is an observed deficit in the rate of $\nu_{\mu}$ charged-current
interactions with an oscillatory dependence on $L_{\nu}/E_{\nu}$, where
$L_{\nu}$ is the neutrino propagation distance, and $E_{\nu}$ is the neutrino
energy. For contained-vertex atmospheric neutrino interactions, the
$L_{\nu}/E_{\nu}$ resolution varies significantly from event to event. The
precision of the oscillation measurement can be improved by incorporating
information on $L_{\nu}/E_{\nu}$ resolution into the oscillation analysis. In
the analysis presented here, a Bayesian technique is used to estimate the
$L_{\nu}/E_{\nu}$ resolution of observed atmospheric neutrinos on an
event-by-event basis. By separating the events into bins of $L_{\nu}/E_{\nu}$
resolution in the oscillation analysis, a significant improvement in
oscillation sensitivity can be achieved.

cancelation scheme is proposed to achieve the maximum DoF of the MIMO X

divided into 3 cases, $3N_2<M_1+M_2<2N_1+N_2$ (Case $A$), $M_1+M_2\geq2N_1+N_2$
(Case $B$), and $M_1+M_2\leq3N_2$ (Case $C$). With the proposed scheme, it is
shown that in Case $A$, the outer-bound $\frac{M_1+M_2+N_2}{2}$ is achievable;
in Case $B$, the achievable DoF equals the outer-bound $N_1+N_2$ if $M_2>N_1$,
otherwise it is 1/2 or 1 less than the outer-bound; in Case $C$, the achievable
DoF is equal to the outer-bound $2/3(M_1+M_2)$ if $(3N_2-M_1-M_2)\mod 3=0$, and
it is 1/3 or 1/6 less than the outer-bound if $(3N_2-M_1-M_2)\mod 3=1

bottleneck analysis, we employ the recently published Execution-Cache-Memory

the scaling and the saturation behavior of bandwidth-limited loop kernels on a

of energy consumption. From power dissipation measurements of benchmark
programs with vastly different requirements to the hardware, we derive a
simple, phenomenological power model for the Sandy Bridge processor. Together
with the ECM model, we are able to explain many peculiarities in the
performance and power behavior of multicore processors, and derive guidelines
for energy-efficient execution of parallel programs. Finally, we show that the

a function of its orbital distance. This simple model is successfully tested
against available chemical composition data from CI chondrites and surface

predicted for bulk early Earth. This converges with other works suggesting that
the interior of the Earth could be enriched with hydrogen.

Strategy, recent comments on several topics are presented. First of all, it is
emphasized that only the simplest version of the fourth chiral generation,
namely, minimal SM4 (mSM4) with only one Higgs doublet is in some tension with
the recent LHC data on the Higgs boson search. This tension, which follows from
the relative strengths of the H --> 4l and Higgs --> {\gamma}{\gamma} channels,
can be naturally resolved if there is a mechanism to enhance the
H-->{\gamma}{\gamma} width (although any charged and heavy particle could
enhance the H-{\gamma}-{\gamma} loop, 2HDM can be given as an example).
  We then emphasize the possible role of the linac-ring type colliders,
especially LHeC (QCD Exploder) and TAC super charm factory. The QCD Explorer
will give opportunity to enlighten the origin of the 98.5% portion of the
visible universe's mass. Especially the {\gamma}-nucleus option seems to be
very promising for QCD studies. The TAC super charm factory may provide
opportunity to investigate the charm physics with statistics well above that of
the dedicated runs at Super-B factories.
  Finally, it is argued that the history of particle physics (and, more
generally, the history of the investigation of the fundamental ingredients of
the matter), a large number of ""fundamental"" particles, an inflation of
observable free parameters, and, especially, the mixing of ""fundamental""
fermions favor the idea of a new set of fundamental particles at a deeper
level. These new particles can be formulated with the preonic or even
pre-preonic models.

of concurrent programs running within the context of a relaxed memory model.
Our framework features a ""temporary store"" where the memory operations issued
by the threads are recorded, in program order. A memory model then specifies
the conditions under which a pending operation from this sequence is allowed to
be globally performed, possibly out of order. The memory model also involves a
""write grain,"" accounting for architectures where a thread may read a write
that is not yet globally visible. Our formal model is supported by a software
simulator, allowing us to run litmus tests in our semantics.
