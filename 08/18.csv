Fermilab. The existing New Muon Lab (NML) building is being converted for this
facility. The accelerator will consist of an electron gun, injector, beam
acceleration section consisting of 3 TTF-type or ILC-type cryomodules, multiple
downstream beam lines for testing diagnostics and conducting various beam
tests, and a high power beam dump. When completed, it is envisioned that this
facility will initially be capable of generating an 810 MeV electron beam with
ILC beam intensity. Expansion plans of the facility are underway that will
provide the capability to upgrade the accelerator to a total beam energy of 1.5
GeV. In addition to testing accelerator components, this facility will be used
to test RF power equipment, instrumentation, LLRF and controls systems for
future SRF accelerators such as the ILC and Project-X. This paper describes the
current status and overall plans for this facility.

of electromagnetic effects in large size, high frequency capacitively coupled

fluid models which are applied to typical cases showing pronounced standing
wave and skin effects. With the first model it is demonstrated that Darwin
approximation is valid for treatment of such effects in the range of parameters
under consideration. The second approach, a reduced nonlinear Darwin
approximation-based model, shows that the electromagnetic phenomena persist in
a more realistic setting. The Darwin approximation offers a simple and
efficient way of carrying out electromagnetic simulations as it removes the
Courant condition plaguing explicit electromagnetic algorithms and can be
implemented as a straightforward modification of electrostatic algorithms. The
algorithm described here avoids iterative schemes needed for the divergence
cleaning and represents a fast and efficient solver, which can be used in fluid
and kinetic models for self-consistent description of technical plasmas
exhibiting certain electromagnetic activity.

sublinear-time approximation algorithm for a $# P$-complete problem. Our
approach is based on the correlation decay of the Gibbs distribution associated
with $Z(G,\lambda)$. We show that our algorithm approximates the probability
for a vertex to be covered by a matching, sampled according to this Gibbs

approximate the average size and the entropy of such a matching within an
additive error with high probability, where again the query complexity is
polynomial in $1/\epsilon$ and the lower bound is quadratic in $1/\epsilon$.
Our algorithms are simple to implement and of practical use when dealing with

the scalar and pseudoscalar quarkonia, eta_c, chi_{c0}, eta_b, chi_{b0}, which
allow for an angular independent investigation. Within the framework of
transverse momentum dependent factorization in combination with the
nonrelativistic QCD based color-singlet quarkonium model, we show for small
transverse momentum (q_T^2 \ll 4 M_Q^2) that the scalar and pseudoscalar
quarkonium production cross sections are modified in different ways by linearly
polarized gluons, while their effects on the production of higher angular
momentum quarkonium states are strongly suppressed. Comparisons to chi_{c2},
chi_{b2} production can help to cancel out uncertainties. Together with the
analogous study in Higgs production at LHC, quarkonium production can moreover
be used to test the scale dependence of the linearly polarized gluon

to mass hierarchy and leptonic CP violation is increased by 20%. Addition of 5
years of neutrino data from T2K to NOvA more than doubles the range of deltacp
for which the leptonic CP violation can be discovered, compared to stand alone

Therefore, we further explore the improvement in the hierarchy and CP violation

NOvA in all respects. We find that combined data from 10 kt liquid argon
detector (3 years of nu + 3 years of nubar run), NOvA (6 years of nu + 6 years

suppression can only occur for those theories that admit such classical static

a quasiclassical softening of quantum fluctuations is only possible for

range between about 10^5 and 3x10^8 G. It is not known whether the remaining
white dwarfs are not magnetic, or if they have a magnetic field too weak to be
detected with the techniques adopted in the large surveys. Aims. We describe
the results of the first survey specifically devised to clarify the detection
frequency of kG-level magnetic fields in cool DA white dwarfs. Methods: Using
the FORS1 instrument of the ESO VLT, we have obtained Balmer line circular
spectropolarimetric measurements of a small sample of cool (DA6 - DA8) white
dwarfs. Using FORS and UVES archive data, we have also revised numerous white
dwarf field measurements previously published in the literature. Results: We
have discovered an apparently constant longitudinal magnetic field of \sim9.5
kG in the DA6 white dwarf WD2105-820. This star is the first weak-field white
dwarf that has been observed sufficiently to roughly determine the
characteristics of its field. The available data are consistent with a simple
dipolar morphology with magnetic axis nearly parallel to the rotation axis, and
a polar strength of \simeq 56 kG. Our re-evaluation of the FORS archive data
for white dwarfs indicates that longitudinal magnetic fields weaker than 10 kG
had previously been correctly identified in at least three white dwarfs.
Conclusions: We find that the probability of detecting a field of kG strength
in a DA white dwarf is of the order of 10% for each of the cool and hot DA
stars. If there is a lower cutoff to field strength in white dwarfs, or a field
below which all white dwarfs are magnetic, the current precision of
measurements is not yet sufficient to reveal it.

periodic signals of special shape with irregularly spaced arguments. This
method was developed for determination of phenomenological characteristics of
the light curves, which are necessary for registration in the ""General
Catalogue of Variable Stars"" and other databases. For eclipsing binary stars
with smooth light curves - of types EB and EW - it is recommended a
trigonometric polynomial of optimal degree in a complete or symmetric form. For
eclipsing binary systems with narrow minima (EA-type), statistically optimal is
an approximation in a class of non-polynomial spline functions. It is used a
combination of the second-order trigonometric polynomial (TP2, what describes
effects of ""reflection"", ""ellipsoidality"" and ""spotness"") and localized
contributions of minima (parametrized in depth and profile separately for
primary and secondary minima). Such an approach is characterized by a
statistical accuracy of the smoothing curve, which is up to ~1.5-2 times better
than the trigonometric polynomial of statistically optimal degree, and the
absence of false ""waves"" in the light curve associated with the effect of
Gibbs. In addition to the minimum width, which can not be determined by a
trigonometric polynomial approximation, the method allows to determine with
better accuracy its depth, as well as to separate the effects of the eclipse
and out-of-eclipse parts. For multi-color observations, improving the accuracy
of the smoothing of the curve in each filter will allow to obtain with better
accuracy the curves of the color index variations. Effectivity of the proposed
method increases with decreasing eclipse depth. The method called NAV (""New
Algol Variable""), was applied to eclipsing binary systems VSX

developing efficient estimators for these two metrics based on a node sample
collected via either independence sampling or random walks. Then, we process
the output of the estimators to ensure that the target properties are
realizable. Finally, we propose an efficient algorithm for generating
topologies that have the exact target JDD and a $\bar{c}(k)$ close to the
target. Extensive simulations using real-life graphs show that the graphs
generated by our methodology are similar to the original graph with respect to,
not only the two target metrics, but also a wide range of other topological
metrics; furthermore, our generator is order of magnitudes faster than
state-of-the-art techniques.

zero beta functions. Nevertheless, the work of Jack and Osborn implies that the

until recently no such behavior had been exhibited. Our recent work has led to
the discovery of CFTs with nonzero beta functions, more precisely CFTs that
live on recurrent trajectories, e.g., limit cycles, of the beta-function vector
field. To demonstrate this we study the S function of Jack and Osborn. We use
Weyl consistency conditions to show that it vanishes at fixed points and agrees
with the generator Q of limit cycles on them. Moreover, we compute S to third
order in perturbation theory, and explicitly verify that it agrees with our
previous determinations of Q. A byproduct of our analysis is that, in
perturbation theory, unitarity and scale invariance imply conformal invariance
in four-dimensional quantum field theories. Finally, we study some properties
of these new, ""cyclic"" CFTs, and point out that the a-theorem still governs the
asymptotic behavior of renormalization-group flows.

is broadly smeared so that the neutrino energy in a particular event is not
directly known, but must be reconstructed from final state properties. In this
paper we investigate the contributions from different reaction mechanisms on
the energy-reconstruction method widely used in long-baseline neutrino
experiments. Difference between the true-QE and QE-like cross sections in
MiniBooNE experiment is investigated in details. It is shown, that fake QE-like
events lead to significant distortions in neutrino energy reconstruction.
Flux-folded and unfolded cross sections for QE-like scattering are calculated
as functions of both true and reconstructed energies. Flux-folded momentum
transfer distributions are calculated as functions of both true and
reconstructed momentum transfer. Distributions versus reconstructed values are
compared with the experimental data. Also presented are the conditional
probability densities of finding a true energy for a given reconstructed
energy. It is shown, how the energy reconstruction procedure influences the
measurement of oscillation parameters in T2K experiment. For the reconstruction
procedure based on quasielastic (QE) kinematics, all other reaction channels
beside true-QE scattering show a shift of the reconstructed energy towards
lower values as compared to the true energy. On average in the MiniBooNE and
T2K experiments the shift is 100 - 200 MeV and depends on energy. The
oscillation signals are similarly affected. These uncertainties may limit the
extraction of a CP violating phase from an oscillation result.

been quite inhomogeneous on small scales, due to the low Jeans mass in the
neutral IGM and the hierarchical growth of structure in a cold dark matter
Universe. This small-scale structure acted as an important sink during the
epoch of reionization, impeding the progress of the ionization fronts that
swept out from the first sources of ionizing radiation. Here we present results
of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamics simulations that resolve the
cosmological Jeans mass of the neutral IGM in representative volumes several
Mpc across. The adiabatic hydrodynamics we follow are appropriate in an
unheated IGM, before the gas has had a chance to respond to the photoionization
heating. Our focus is determination of the resolution required in cosmological

regulating the opacity of an unheated IGM. We find that a dark matter particle

typically of 10 to 20 for an ionization rate of Gamma ~ 0.3 - 3 x 1e-12 s^-1,

verified that with this restriction on information exchange, measurement fusion
alone results in an unbounded estimation error at every such agent that does
not have an observable set of measurements in its neighborhood. To over come
this challenge, state-estimate fusion has been proposed to recover the system
observability. However, we show that adding state-estimate fusion may not

Kepler data. Authors argue that this object may be a transiting disintegrating
planet with a comet like dusty tail. We calculate the light-curves of stars
with such planets and take into account the Mie absorption and scattering on
spherical dust grains of various sizes assuming realistic dust opacities and
phase functions and finite radius of the source of the scattered light. The
planet light-curve is reanalysed using long and short cadence Kepler
observations from the first 14 quarters. Orbital period of the planet was
improved. We prove that the peculiar light-curve of this objects is in
agreement with the idea of a planet with a comet like tail. There is an
evidence of a quasi periodic long term evolution of the tail. Light-curve has a
prominent pre-transit brightening and a less prominent post-transit
brightening. Both are caused by the forward scattering and are a strong
function of the particle size. This feature enabled us to estimate a typical
particle size (radius) in the dust tail of about 0.1-1 micron. However, there
is an indication that the particle size changes along the tail. Larger
particles better reproduce the pre-transit brightening and transit core while
smaller particles are more compatible with the egress and post-transit
brightening. Dust density in the tail is a steep decreasing function of the
distance from the planet which indicates a significant tail destruction caused
by the star. We also argue that the 'planet' does not show uniform behaviour
but may have at least two constituents. This light-curve with pre-transit
brightening is analogous to the light-curve of $\epsilon$ Aur with mid-eclipse

simulations of a dwarf galaxy assembling inside a halo of virial mass 10^9
solar at z = 10. The simulations follow the non-equilibrium chemistry/cooling
of primordial gas and the conversion of the gas into metal-free stars. To
quantify the radiative feedback, we compare a simulation in which stars emit
both molecular hydrogen dissociating and hydrogen/helium ionizing radiation
with a simulation in which stars emit only dissociating radiation, and with a
simulation in which stars remain dark. Photodissociation and -ionization exert
a strong negative feedback on the assembly of the simulated galaxy. Gas
condensation is strongly impeded, and star formation is strongly suppressed in
comparison with the simulation in which stars remain dark. The feedback on the
gas implies a suppression of the central dark matter densities in the minihalo
progenitor by factors of up to a few, which is a significant deviation from the
singular isothermal density profile characterizing the dark matter distribution
in the absence of radiative feedback. The evolution of gas densities, star
formation rates, and the distribution of dark matter becomes insensitive to the
inclusion of dissociating radiation in the late stages of the minihalo
assembly, and it becomes insensitive to the inclusion of ionizing radiation
once the minihalo turns into an atomically cooling galaxy. The formation of an
extended disk inside the dwarf galaxy is a robust outcome not affected by the
inclusion of radiation. We estimate that dwarf galaxies such as simulated here
will be among the faintest galaxies the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope

three-dimensional non-linear magnetohydrodynamical model in a spherical shell

motion by the counter-rotation of the two hemispheric walls. The resulting flow
is of von K\'arm\'an type, consisting of a layer of zonal velocity close to the
outer wall and a secondary meridional circulation. Above a certain forcing
threshold, the mean flow is unstable to non-axisymmetric motions within an
equatorial belt. For fixed forcing above this threshold, we have studied the
dynamo properties of this flow. The presence of a conducting outer wall is
essential to the existence of a dynamo at these parameters. We have therefore
studied the effect of changing the material parameters of the wall (magnetic
permeability, electrical conductivity, and thickness) on the dynamo. In common
with previous studies, we find that dynamos are obtained only when either the
conductivity or the permeability is sufficiently large. However, we find that
the effect of these two parameters on the dynamo process are different and can
even compete to the detriment of the dynamo. Our self-consistent approach allow
us to analyze in detail the dynamo feedback loop. The dynamos we obtain are
typically dominated by an axisymmetric toroidal magnetic field and an axial
dipole component. We show that the ability of the outer shear layer to produce
a strong toroidal field depends critically on the presence of a conducting
outer wall, which shields the fluid from the vacuum outside. The generation of
the axisymmetric poloidal field, on the other hand, occurs in the equatorial
belt and does not depend on the wall properties.

develop ion force fields have generally focused on reproducing experimental
measurements of aqueous solution properties such as hydration free energies and
ion-water distribution functions. This dependency limits transferability of the
resulting parameters because of the variety and known limitations of water
models. We present a solvent-independent approach to calibrating ion parameters
based exclusively on crystal lattice properties. Our procedure relies on
minimization of lattice sums to calculate lattice energies and interionic
distances instead of equilibrium ensemble simulations of dense fluids. The gain
in computational efficiency enables simultaneous optimization of all parameters
for Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, Cs+, F-, Cl-, Br-, and I- subject to constraints that
enforce consistency with periodic table trends. We demonstrate the method by
presenting lattice-derived parameters for the primitive model and the
Lennard-Jones model with Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules. The resulting
parameters successfully reproduce the lattice properties used to derive them
and are free from the influence of any water model. To assess the
transferability of the Lennard-Jones parameters to aqueous systems, we used
them to estimate hydration free energies and found that the results were in
quantitative agreement with experimentally measured values. These
lattice-derived parameters are applicable in simulations where coupling of ion
parameters to a particular solvent model is undesirable. The simplicity and low
computational demands of the calibration procedure make it suitable for
parametrization of crystallizable ions in a variety of force fields.

reconstruction bias, and uncertainties in the magnetic field. The two step
method uses the mean $<1/p^\mu_T>$ for muons from $Z\to \mu\mu$ decays to
determine the momentum scale corrections in bins of charge, $\eta$ and $\phi$.
In the second step, the corrections are tuned by using the average invariant
mass $<M^Z_{\mu\mu}>$ of $Z\to \mu\mu$ events in the same bins of charge $\eta$
and $\phi$. The forward-backward asymmetry of $Z/\gamma^{*} \to \mu\mu$ pairs
as a function of $\mu^+\mu^-$ mass, and the $\phi$ distribution of $Z$ bosons
in the Collins-Soper frame are used to ascertain that the corrections remove
the bias in the momentum measurements for positive versus negatively charged
muons. By taking the sum and difference of the momentum scale corrections for
positive and negative muons, we isolate additive corrections to $1/p^\mu_T$
that may originate from misalignments and multiplicative corrections that may
originate from mis-modeling of the magnetic field $(\int \vec{B} \cdot

inward due to gravitational interaction with trailing spiral arms, and can be
absorbed into the central object. However, in situations of multiple clump
formation, gravitational scattering of clumps can result in the ejection of a
low mass clump. These clumps can then give rise to free-floating low mass
stars, brown dwarfs, or even giant planets. Detailed modeling of this process

out essentially as Larson first cores and grow subsequently by accretion. In
the context of Pop III star formation, preliminary indications are that the

component is included. It is important for early epoch when the radiation
cannot be neglected because the equation of state (EoS) of the effective dark
energy becomes time variable. Therefore, it is not equivalent to the
quintessence model with a constant EoS anymore. This situation was almost
overlooked in the literature. By using the recent released Union2 557 of type
Ia supernovae (SN Ia), the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from Sloan Digital
Sky Survey and the WiggleZ data points, the full information of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) measurement given by the seven-year Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe observation, we constrain the Cardassian model via
the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. A tight constraint is obtained: $n=
-0.0479_{- 0.0732- 0.148}^{+ 0.0730+ 0.142}$ in $1,2\sigma$ regions. The
deviation of Cardassian model from quintessence model is shown in CMB
anisotropic power spectra at high l's parts due to the evolution of EoS. But it
is about the order of 0.1% which cannot be discriminated by current data sets.
The Cardassian model is consistent with current cosmic observational data sets.

on the well known nonlocal means (NLM) filtering and takes advantage of
self-similarity in images, which helps to suppress the staircase effect and
restore the fine details. Furthermore, an efficient augmented Lagrangian based

quantum chemical calculations has been made in the past two decades. The main
focus has always been the desire to be able to treat ever larger molecules or
molecular assemblies---especially linear and sub-linear scaling techniques are
devoted to the accomplishment of this goal. However, as many chemical reactions
are rather local, they usually involve only a limited number of atoms so that
models of about two hundred (or even less) atoms embedded in a suitable
environment are sufficient to study their mechanisms. Thus, the system size
does not need to be enlarged, but remains constant for reactions of this type
that can be described by less than two hundred atoms. The question then arises
how fast one can obtain the quantum chemical results. This question is not
directly answered by linear-scaling techniques. In fact, ideas such as haptic
quantum chemistry or interactive quantum chemistry require an immediate
provision of quantum chemical information which demands the calculation of data
in ""real time"". In this perspective, we aim at a definition of real-time
quantum chemistry, explore its realm and eventually discuss applications in the
field of haptic quantum chemistry. For the latter we elaborate whether a direct
approach is possible by virtue of real-time quantum chemistry.

were obtained, including lower bounds on the percolation threshold. In the
present investigation, we provide additional analytical results for certain
cluster statistics, such as the concentration of $k$-mers and related
quantities, and obtain an upper bound on the percolation threshold $\eta_c$. We
utilize the tightest lower bound obtained in the first paper to formulate an
efficient simulation method, called the {\it rescaled-particle} algorithm, to
estimate continuum percolation properties across many space dimensions with
heretofore unattained accuracy. This simulation procedure is applied to compute
the threshold $\eta_c$ and associated mean number of overlaps per particle
${\cal N}_c$ for both overlapping hyperspheres and oriented hypercubes for $ 3
\le d \le 11$. These simulations results are compared to corresponding upper
and lower bounds on these percolation properties. We find that the bounds
converge to one another as the space dimension increases, but the lower bound
provides an excellent estimate of $\eta_c$ and ${\cal N}_c$, even for
relatively low dimensions. We confirm a prediction of the first paper in this
series that low-dimensional percolation properties encode high-dimensional
information. We also show that the concentration of monomers dominate over
concentration values for higher-order clusters (dimers, trimers, etc.) as the

state of the star material. In this study, we take into account dark matter
particles, assumed to behave like fermions with a free parameter to account for
the interaction strength among the particles, as a possible constituent of
neutron stars. We find dark matter inside the star would soften the equation of
state more strongly than that of hyperons, and reduce largely the maximum mass
of the star. However, the neutron star maximum mass is sensitive to the
particle mass of dark matter, and a very high neutron star mass larger than 2
times solar mass could be achieved when the particle mass is small enough. Such
kind of dark-matter- admixed neutron stars could explain the recent measurement
of the Shapiro delay in the radio pulsar PSR J1614-2230, which yielded a
neutron star mass of 2 times solar mass that may be hardly reached when
hyperons are considered only, as in the case of the microscopic Brueckner
theory. Furthermore, in this particular case, we point out that the dark matter
around a neutron star should also contribute to the mass measurement due to its
pure gravitational effect. However, our numerically calculation illustrates
that such contribution could be safely ignored because of the usual diluted
dark matter environment assumed. We conclude that a very high mass measurement
of about 2 times solar mass requires a really stiff equation of state in
neutron stars, and find a strong upper limit (<= 0.64 GeV) for the particle
mass of non-self- annihilating dark matter based on the present model.

solution to mitigate privacy problems on the Internet. Tor (short for The onion
router) is a popular low-latency anonymity system that can be installed as an
end-user application on a wide range of operating systems to redirect the
traffic through a series of anonymising proxy circuits. The construction of
these circuits determines both the latency and the anonymity degree of the Tor
anonymity system. While some circuit construction strategies lead to delays
which are tolerated for activities like Web browsing, they can make the system
vulnerable to linking attacks. We evaluate in this paper three classical
strategies for the construction of Tor circuits, with respect to their
de-anonymisation risk and latency performance. We then develop a new circuit
selection algorithm that considerably reduces the success probability of
linking attacks while keeping a good degree of performance. We finally conduct
experiments on a real-world Tor deployment over PlanetLab. Our experimental
results confirm the validity of our strategy and its performance increase for
Web browsing.

in contrast to the problem of free motions without gravity. The reason is that
the usual iteration method for quasilinear hyperbolic problem cannot be used

ultimately dissipates to heat. The power of this process has previously been
estimated to be around 2-4 W m-2 in the tropics: a value comparable in
magnitude to the dynamic power of the global circulation. Here we suggest that
this previous power estimate is approximately double the true figure. Our
result reflects a revised evaluation of the mean precipitation path length Hp.
We investigate the dependence of Hp on surface temperature,relative
humidity,temperature lapse rate and degree of condensation in the ascending
air. We find that the degree of condensation,defined as the relative change of
the saturated water vapor mixing ratio in the region of condensation, is a
major factor determining Hp. We estimate from theory that the mean large-scale
rate of frictional dissipation associated with total precipitation in the
tropics lies between 1 and 2 W m-2 and show that our estimate is supported by
empirical evidence. We show that under terrestrial conditions frictional
dissipation constitutes a minor fraction of the dynamic power of
condensation-induced atmospheric circulation,which is estimated to be at least
2.5 times larger. However,because Hp increases with surface temperature Ts, the
rate of frictional dissipation would exceed that of condensation-induced
dynamics, and thus block major circulation, at Ts >~320 K in a moist adiabatic
atmosphere.

infer unspotted brightness, V - I and/or b - y colors, spot-induced brightness
amplitudes and precise rotation periods. Our data are complemented by
literature data and are used to determine rotation-temperature-activity
relations for active binary components. We also relate lithium abundance to
rotation and surface temperature. We find that 74% of all known
rapidly-rotating active binary stars are synchronized and in circular orbits
but 26% are rotating asynchronously of which half have Prot > Porb and e > 0.
Because rotational synchronization is predicted to occur before orbital
circularization active binaries should undergo an extra spin-down besides tidal
dissipation. We suspect this to be due to a magnetically channeled wind with
its subsequent braking torque. We find a steep increase of rotation period with
decreasing effective temperature for active stars. For inactive, single giants
with Prot > 100 d, the relation is much weaker. Our data also indicate a
period-activity relation for H{\alpha} of the form RH{\alpha} \propto P - 0.24

our sample increase with effective temperature. On average, binaries of

in supersymmetry with extra vector-like fermions. Higgs mass is obtained from
loops of top quark and vector-like fermions from the global symmetry breaking
scale f at around TeV. The mu, Bmu/mu \sim f are generated from the dynamics of
global symmetry breaking and the Higgs quartic coupling vanishes at f as tan
beta \simeq 1. The relation of msoft \sim $4\pi M_Z$ with f \sim mu \sim m_soft
\sim TeV is obtained and large mu does not cause a fine tuning for the
electroweak symmetry breaking. The Higgs to di-photon rate can be enhanced from
the loop of uncolored vector-like matters. The stability problem of Higgs
potential with vector-like fermions can be nicely cured by the UV completion
with the Goldstone picture.

($\sigma^z_{xy}$ and $\sigma^z_{yx}$) in a clean, two-dimensional system with
generic k-linear spin-orbit interaction. The coefficients of the product of the
momentum and spin components form a spin-orbit matrix $\widetilde{\beta}$. We
find that the determinant of the spin-orbit matrix $\detbeta$ describes the
effective coupling of the spin $s_z$ and orbital motion $L_z$. The decoupling
of spin and orbital motion results in a sign change of the ISHC and the
band-overlapping phenomenon. Furthermore, we show that the ISHC is in general
unsymmetrical ($\sigma^z_{xy}\neq-\sigma^z_{yx}$), and it is governed by the
asymmetric response function $\Deltabeta$, which is the difference in
band-splitting along two directions: those of the applied electric field and
the spin-Hall current. The obtained non-vanishing asymmetric response function
also implies that the ISHC can be larger than $e/8\pi$, but has an upper bound
value of $e/4\pi$. We will that the unsymmetrical properties of the ISHC can
also be deduced from the manifestation of the Berry curvature at the nearly
degenerate area. On the other hand, by investigating the equilibrium spin
current, we find that $\detbeta$ determines the field strength of the SU(2)
non-Abelian gauge field.

in a few of iterative steps. Moreover, each set/slave-processor majorly
communicate with its nearest neighbors, and the transferring data between
sets/slave-processors and master is always far below the set-neighbor

has been implemented based on MPI library, and a super large 2-dimension square

Voronoi regions induced by given sites. It seems intuitively clear that each
point in the space belongs to at least one of the regions, i.e., no neutral
region can exist. As simple counterexamples show this is not true in general,
but we present a simple necessary and sufficient condition ensuring the
non-existence of a neutral region. We discuss a similar phenomenon concerning
recent variations of Voronoi diagrams called zone diagrams, double zone
diagrams, and (double) territory diagrams. These objects are defined in a
somewhat implicit way and they also induce a decomposition of the space into
regions. In several works it was claimed without providing a proof that some of
these objects induce a decomposition in which a neutral region must exist. We
show that this assertion is true in a wide class of cases but not in general.
We also discuss other properties related to the neutral region, among them a
one related to the concentration of measure phenomenon.

oxygen nuclei and fission them. Among the products of this fission is lithium.
Given this preference for carbon and oxygen atoms, in this work I propose that
in an atmosphere of almost pure CO2, such as Mars and Venus atmospheres,
lithium nuclei are produced by interaction with cosmic rays. I calculated the
production rate of lithium and came to the conclusion that, for pressures of
two bars or greater, are produced between 21 and 81 lithium nuclei for each
primary cosmic rays proton. For lower pressures, the production is less and
almost nil with the current pressure of Mars or Earth (pressure of CO2).
Assuming a rate of cosmic ray arrival at Mars equal to that of Earth, and a
pressure greater than two bars throughout the history of Mars, the amount of
lithium that would occur would be between 162 and 642 million metric tons (in
the Earth lithium estimated reserves are 30 million metric tons). These values
are an upper limit; the actual amount of lithium on Mars will depend on the
time in which the planet had a dense atmosphere (> 2 bars). That is, the amount
of lithium produced by cosmic rays, serves to estimate the time that Mars had a
thick atmosphere and therefore the capacity for have liquid water on surface.
