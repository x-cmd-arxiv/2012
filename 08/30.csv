the fraction of globular clusters (GC) that contain low-mass X-ray binaries
(LMXB), by utilizing all available data obtained with Chandra for LMXBs and HST
ACS for GCs. Our primary sample consists of old elliptical galaxies selected
from the ACS Virgo and Fornax surveys. To improve statistics at both the lowest
and highest X-ray luminosity, we also use previously reported results from
other galaxies. It is well known that the LMXB fraction is considerably higher
in red, metal-rich, than in blue, metal-poor GCs. In this paper, we test
whether this metallicity effect is X-ray luminosity-dependent, and find that
the effect holds uniformly in a wide luminosity range. This result is
statistically significant (at >= 3 sigma) in LMXBs with luminosities in the
range LX = 2 x 10^37 - 5 x 10^38 erg s-1, where the ratio of LMXB fractions in
metal-rich to metal-poor GCs is R = 3.4 +- 0.5. A similar ratio is also found
at lower (down to 10^36 erg s-1) and higher luminosities (up to the ULX
regime), but with less significance (~2 sigma confidence). Because different
types of LMXBs dominate in different luminosities, our finding requires a new
explanation for the metallicity effect in dynamically formed LMXBs. We confirm
that the metallicity effect is not affected by other factors such as stellar
age, GC mass, stellar encounter rate, and galacto-centric distance.

fitness diversity with numerous genomic loci under selection. It is also known
that genealogical trees for populations under selection are quantifiably
different from those expected under neutral evolution and described
statistically by Kingman's coalescent. While differences in the statistical
structure of genealogies have long been used as a test for the presence of
selection, the full extent of the information that they contain has not been
exploited. Here we shall demonstrate that the shape of the reconstructed
genealogical tree for a moderately large number of random genomic samples taken
from a fitness diverse, but otherwise unstructured asexual population can be
used to predict the relative fitness of individuals within the sample. To
achieve this we define a heuristic algorithm, which we test in silico using
simulations of a Wright-Fisher model for a realistic range of mutation rates
and selection strength. Our inferred fitness ranking is based on a linear
discriminator which identifies rapidly coalescing lineages in the reconstructed
tree. Inferred fitness ranking correlates strongly with actual fitness, with a
genome in the top 10% ranked being in the top 20% fittest with false discovery
rate of 0.1-0.3 depending on the mutation/selection parameters. The ranking
also enables to predict the genotypes that future populations inherit from the
present one. While the inference accuracy increases monotonically with sample
size, samples of 200 nearly saturate the performance. We propose that our
approach can be used for inferring relative fitness of genomes obtained in
single-cell sequencing of tumors and in monitoring viral outbreaks.

agreement with this in a certain neighborhood of the origin in the Fourier
domain by Rubinstein in his Ph.D. thesis in 1998. An attempt to extend the
neighborhood was made in the Ph.D. thesis of Peng Gao (2005), who under GRH
gave the density as a complicated combinatorial factor, but it remained open
whether it coincides with the Random Matrix Theory factor. For n at most 7 this
was recently confirmed by Levinson and Miller. We resolve this problem for all
n, not by directly doing the combinatorics, but by passing to a function field
analogue, of L-functions associated to hyper-elliptic curves of given genus g
over a field of q elements. We show that the answer in this case coincides with
Gao's combinatorial factor up to a controlled error. We then take the limit of
large finite field size q to infinity and use the Katz-Sarnak equidistribution
theorem, which identifies the monodromy of the Frobenius conjugacy classes for
the hyperelliptic ensemble with the group USp(2g). Further taking the limit of

X-ray emission from shocked ambient medium has not firmly been detected yet in

prediction. We performed spatially resolved spectral analysis of a set of
regions covering the southeastern rim of SN 1006. We studied the spatial
distribution of the thermodynamic properties of the ambient medium and
carefully verified the robustness of the result with respect to the analysis
method. We detected the contribution of the shocked ambient medium. We also
found that the postshock density of the interstellar medium significantly
increases in regions where particle acceleration is efficient. Under the
assumption of uniform preshock density, we found that the shock compression
ratio reaches a value of ~6 in regions near the nonthermal limbs. Our results
support the predictions of shock modification theory and indicate that effects

binaries (LMXBs). Observers detect ~100 times more LMXBs per stellar mass in
GCs compared to stars in the fields of galaxies. It has also been
observationally established that metal-rich GCs are about 3 times more likely
to contain an X-ray source than their metal-poor counterparts. Recent
observations have shown that this ratio holds in extragalactic GCs for all
bright X-ray sources with Lx between 2X10^{37} and 5X10^{38} erg/s. In this
Letter, we propose that the observed metallicity dependence of LMXBs in
extragalactic GCs can be explained by the differences in the number densities
and average masses of red giants in populations of different metallicities. Red
giants serve as seeds for the dynamical production of bright LMXBs via two
channels - binary exchanges and physical collisions - and the increase of the
number densities and masses of red giants boost LMXB production, leading to the

as defined in the recent work of Arnold and Awanou [Found. Comput. Math. 11

dimension than the more commonly used bicubic and tricubic Hermite tensor
product spaces - 12 instead of 16 for the square and 32 instead of 64 for the
cube - yet are still guaranteed to obtain cubic order \textit{a priori} error
estimates in $H^1$ norm when used in finite element methods. The basis
functions we define have a canonical relationship both to the finite element
degrees of freedom as well as to the geometry of their graphs; this means the
bases may be suitable for applications employing isogeometric analysis where
domain geometry and functions supported on the domain are described by the same
basis functions. Moreover, the basis functions are linear combinations of the
commonly used bicubic and tricubic polynomial Bernstein or Hermite basis
functions, allowing their rapid incorporation into existing finite element
codes.

simulation of fermionic systems presents a specific challenge. The

fermions with qubits, first proposed by Bravyi and Kitaev [S. B. Bravyi, A.Yu.
Kitaev, Annals of Physics 298, 210-226 (2002)], that reduces the simulation
cost to O(log n) qubit operations for one fermionic operation. We apply this
new Bravyi-Kitaev transformation to the task of simulating quantum chemical
Hamiltonians, and give a detailed example for the simplest possible case of
molecular hydrogen in a minimal basis. We show that the quantum circuit for
simulating a single Trotter time-step of the Bravyi-Kitaev derived Hamiltonian
for H2 requires fewer gate applications than the equivalent circuit derived
from the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Since the scaling of the Bravyi-Kitaev
method is asymptotically better than the Jordan-Wigner method, this result for
molecular hydrogen in a minimal basis demonstrates the superior efficiency of
the Bravyi-Kitaev method for all quantum computations of electronic structure.

explain what singularities can occur under the flow and also why it can be
assumed to be in generic position.
  The mean curvature flow is the negative gradient flow of volume, so any
hypersurface flows through hypersurfaces in the direction of steepest descent
for volume and eventually becomes extinct in finite time. Before it becomes

remarkable extension to arbitrary genus whose structure is deeply related to
the characterization of the Jacobian locus. Furthermore, it turns out that the
bosonic string measure has an elegant geometrical interpretation as generating
the quadrics in P^{g-1} characterizing the Riemann surface. All this leads to
identify forms on the Siegel upper half-space that, if certain conditions
related to the characterization of the Jacobian are satisfied, express the
bosonic measure as a multiresidue in the Siegel upper half-space. We also
suggest that it may exist a super analog on the super Siegel half-space.

the gas/grain chemistry, including the formation and evolution of more complex
organic molecules in ices. Pre-stellar cores provide the original reservoir of
material from which future planetary systems are built, but few observational
constraints exist on the formation of water and its partitioning between gas
and ice in the densest cores. Thanks to the high sensitivity of the Herschel
Space Observatory, we report on the first detection of water vapor at high
spectral resolution toward a dense cloud on the verge of star formation, the
pre-stellar core L1544. The line shows an inverse P-Cygni profile,
characteristic of gravitational contraction. To reproduce the observations,
water vapor has to be present in the cold and dense central few thousand AU of
L1544, where species heavier than Helium are expected to freeze-out onto dust
grains, and the ortho:para H2 ratio has to be around 1:1 or larger. The
observed amount of water vapor within the core (about 1.5x10^{-6} Msun) can be
maintained by Far-UV photons locally produced by the impact of galactic cosmic
rays with H2 molecules. Such FUV photons irradiate the icy mantles, liberating
water wapor in the core center. Our Herschel data, combined with radiative
transfer and chemical/dynamical models, shed light on the interplay between gas
and solids in dense interstellar clouds and provide the first measurement of
the water vapor abundance profile across the parent cloud of a future
solar-type star and its potential planetary system.

around massive, isolated protostars collapse or shrink from diameters of 80 or
300 AU, depending on the model choice, down to near absence during the swelling
of stellar radius that accompanies the protostar's transition from a convective

investigated by a commercial simulation tool, Virtual Reactor (VR). DCS
suppresses the formation of elemental Si at lower pressures, reduces precursor
losses, and leads to increased growth rate. However, at higher pressures, even
DCS decomposes into elemental Si, which contributes to high Si depletion,
limiting the maximum achievable growth rate. Reduction of Si loss using DCS is
verified by mass measurements of parasitic depositions in the injector tube.
The doping concentration of the epitaxial film is governed by the effective
C/Si ratio at the growth surface rather than the inlet C/Si ratio, which is
examined at various growth pressures. In addition to the widely known
Si-depletion, C-depletion is also shown to exist and it plays a critical role
in determining the doping concentration at various growth conditions. Increased
roughness for the DCS growth at higher pressures is addressed and attributed to
excessive HCl etching at higher pressures.

itself that restricts to the monomial Cremona subgroup and preserves de
Jonqui\`eres maps. In the monomial restriction this duality commutes with

could help to explain the physical structure of the accretion flow, and also to
assess the impact of accretion on the evolution of the AGN host galaxies. Here
we present our first attempt to systematically address the issue of the origin
of the complexities observed in absorption profiles. Using a simple method, we
compute absorption line profiles against a continuum point source for several
simulations of accretion disk winds. We investigate the geometrical,
ionization, and dynamical effects on the absorption line shapes. We find that
significant complexity and diversity of the absorption line profile shapes can
be produced by the non-monotonic distribution of the wind velocity, density,
and ionization state. Non-monotonic distributions of such quantities are
present even in steady-state, smooth disk winds, and naturally lead to the
formation of multiple and detached absorption troughs. These results
demonstrate that the part of a wind where an absorption line is formed is not
representative of the entire wind. Thus, the information contained in the
absorption line is incomplete if not even insufficient to well estimate gross
properties of the wind such as the total mass and energy fluxes. In addition,
the highly dynamical nature of certain portions of disk winds can have
important effects on the estimates of the wind properties. For example, the
mass outflow rates can be off up to two orders of magnitude with respect to
estimates based on a spherically symmetric, homogeneous, constant velocity
wind.

enables a fast response while enhancing resistances of responses and
bistability to stimulus noise. We now find that in addition: 1) the dual-time
structure confers resistance to internal noise due to molecule number
fluctuations, and 2) model variants with altered coupling, which better
represent some specific systems, share all the above advantages. We develop a
similar bistable model with a fast autoactivation loop coupled to a slow loop,
which minimally represents positive feedback that may be essential for
long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP). The advantages of fast response and
noise resistance carry over to this model. Empirically, LTP develops resistance
to reversal over ~1 h. The model suggests this resistance may result from
increased amounts of synaptic kinases involved in positive feedback.

networks. Initially, k pieces of information (henceforth called tokens) are
distributed among n nodes. The tokens need to be broadcast to all nodes through
a synchronous network in which the topology can change arbitrarily from round
to round provided that some connectivity requirements are satisfied.
  If the network is guaranteed to be connected in every round and each node can
broadcast a single token per round to its neighbors, there is a simple token
dissemination algorithm that manages to deliver all k tokens to all the nodes
in O(nk) rounds. Interestingly, in a recent paper, Dutta et al. proved an
almost matching Omega(n + nk/log n) lower bound for deterministic
token-forwarding algorithms that are not allowed to combine, split, or change
tokens in any way. In the present paper, we extend this bound in different
ways.
  If nodes are allowed to forward b < k tokens instead of only one token in
every round, a straight-forward extension of the O(nk) algorithm disseminates
all k tokens in time O(nk/b). We show that for any randomized token-forwarding
algorithm, Omega(n + nk/(b^2 log n log log n)) rounds are necessary. If nodes
can only send a single token per round, but we are guaranteed that the network
graph is c-vertex connected in every round, we show a lower bound of
Omega(nk/(c log^{3/2} n)), which almost matches the currently best O(nk/c)
upper bound. Further, if the network is T-interval connected, a notion that
captures connection stability over time, we prove that Omega(n + nk/(T^2 log
n)) rounds are needed. The best known upper bound in this case manages to solve
the problem in O(n + nk/T) rounds. Finally, we show that even if each node only
needs to obtain a delta-fraction of all the tokens for some delta in [0,1],
Omega(nk delta^3 log n) are still required.

controlled lower extremity prostheses may restore intuitive and able-body-like
ambulation after SCI. To test its feasibility, the authors developed and tested
a novel EEG-based, data-driven BCI system for intuitive and self-paced control
of the ambulation of an avatar within a virtual reality environment (VRE).
  Approach: Eight able-bodied subjects and one with SCI underwent the following
10-min training session: subjects alternated between idling and walking
kinaesthetic motor imageries (KMI) while their EEG were recorded and analysed
to generate subject-specific decoding models. Subjects then performed a
goal-oriented online task, repeated over 5 sessions, in which they utilised the
KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10 sequential stops
at designated points within the VRE.
  Main results: The average offline training performance across subjects was
77.2 +/- 9.5%, ranging from 64.3% (p = 0.00176) to 94.5% (p = 6.26*10^-23),
with chance performance being 50%. The average online performance was 8.4 +/-
1.0 (out of 10) successful stops and 303 +/- 53 sec completion time (perfect =
211 sec). All subjects achieved performances significantly different than those
of random walk (p < 0.05) in 44 of the 45 online sessions.
  Significance: By using a data-driven machine learning approach to decode
users' KMI, this BCIVRE system enabled intuitive and purposeful self-paced
control of ambulation after only a 10-minute training. The ability to achieve
such BCI control with minimal training indicates that the implementation of
future BCI-lower extremity prosthesis systems may be feasible.

real world complex networks, the classic rumor spreading model need to be
modified to consider the dependence of rumor spread rate on the degree of the
spreader and the informed nodes. We have given a modified rumor spreading model
to accommodate these facts. This new model, has been studied for rumor
spreading in complex networks in this work. Nonlinear rumor spread exponent
$\alpha$ and degree dependent tie strength exponent $\beta$ in any complex
network gives rumor threshold as some finite value. In the present work, the
modified rumor spreading model has been studied in scale free networks. It is
also found that if $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ parameters are tuned to appropriate
value, the rumor threshold becomes independent of network size. In any social
network, rumors can spread may have undesirable effect. One of the possible
solutions to control rumor spread, is to inoculate a certain fraction of nodes
against rumors. The inoculation can be done randomly or in a targeted fashion.
We have used modified rumor spreading model over scale free networks to
investigate the efficacy of inoculation. Random and targeted inoculation
schemes have been applied. It has been observed that rumor threshold in random
inoculation scheme is greater than the rumor threshold in the model without any
inoculation scheme. But random inoculation is not that much effective. The
rumor threshold in targeted inoculation is very high than the rumor threshold
in the random inoculation in suppressing the rumor.

primary foci of astrophysics, although there has yet to be any direct evidence
for its existence (Porter et al. 2011). Indirect evidence for the existence of
dark matter is largely rooted in the rotational speeds of stars within their
host galaxies, where, instead of having a ~ r^1/2 radial dependence, stars
appear to have orbital speeds independent of their distance from the galactic
center, which led to proposed existence of dark matter (Porter et al. 2011;
Peebles 1993). We propose an alternate explanation for the observed stellar
motions within galaxies, combining the standard treatment of a fluid-like
spacetime with the possibility of a ""bulk flow"" of mass through the Universe.
The differential ""flow"" of spacetime could generate vorticies capable of
providing the ""perceived"" rotational speeds in excess of those predicted by
Newtonian mechanics. Although a more detailed analysis of our theory is
forthcoming, we find a crude ""order of magnitude"" calculation can explain this
phenomena. We also find that this can be used to explain the graviational
lensing observed around globular clusters like ""Bullet Cluster"".

$\alpha'$. In this work we clarify that the previous claim is indeed valid for
the bosonic open string, but for the supersymmetric one the situation is much
more better than that: there are constraints in the kinematical bosonic terms
of the amplitude (probably due to Spacetime Supersymmetry) such that a much
lower open superstring $n$-point amplitude is needed to find all the
${\alpha'}^N$ order terms. In this `revisited' S-matrix approach we have
checked that, at least up to ${\alpha'}^4$ order, using these kinematical

possible to determine all the bosonic terms of the low energy effective

the ones achieved by the method of BPS configurations, proposed about ten years

Finding this sequence, however, is generally intractable. As a result, many
well-established methods select actions greedily. Surprisingly, this often
performs well. Our work first explains this high performance -- we note a
commonly used metric, reduction of Shannon entropy, is submodular under certain
assumptions, rendering the greedy solution comparable to the optimal plan in
the offline setting. However, reacting online to observations can increase
performance. Recently developed notions of adaptive submodularity provide
guarantees for a greedy algorithm in this online setting. In this work, we
develop new methods based on adaptive submodularity for selecting a sequence of

can capitalize on submodularity to attain additional computational speedups. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in simulation and on a robot.

accumulating in a neoplasm. These few driver alterations reside in a cancer
genome alongside tens of thousands of other mutations that are widely believed
to have no role in cancer and termed passengers. Many passengers, however, fall
within protein coding genes and other functional elements and can possibly have
deleterious effects on cancer cells. Here we investigate a potential of mildly
deleterious passengers to accumulate and alter the course of neoplastic
progression. Our approach combines evolutionary simulations of cancer
progression with the analysis of cancer sequencing data. In our simulations,
individual cells stochastically divide, acquire advantageous driver and
deleterious passenger mutations, or die. Surprisingly, despite selection
against them, passengers accumulate and largely evade selection during
progression. Although individually weak, the collective burden of passengers
alters the course of progression leading to several phenomena observed in
oncology that cannot be explained by a traditional driver-centric view. We
tested predictions of the model using cancer genomic data. We find that many
passenger mutations are likely to be damaging and that, in agreement with the
model, they have largely evaded purifying selection. Finally, we used our model
to explore cancer treatments that exploit the load of passengers by either 1)
increasing the mutation rate; or 2) exacerbating their deleterious effects.
While both approaches lead to cancer regression, the later leads to less
frequent relapse. Our results suggest a new framework for understanding cancer
progression as a balance of driver and passenger mutations.

For example,
in the presence of time reversal symmetry, the orbital magnetic moment and
Berry curvature of the Bloch states must vanish unless inversion symmetry is
broken. In certain 2D electron systems such as bilayer graphene, the intrinsic
inversion symmetry can be broken simply by applying a perpendicular electric
field. In principle, this offers the remarkable possibility of switching on/off
and continuously tuning the magnetic moment and Berry curvature near the Dirac
valleys by reversible electrical control. Here we demonstrate this principle
for the first time using bilayer MoS2, which has the same symmetry as bilayer
graphene but has a bandgap in the visible that allows direct optical probing of
these Berry-phase related properties. We show that the optical circular
dichroism, which reflects the orbital magnetic moment in the valleys, can be
continuously tuned from -15% to 15% as a function of gate voltage in bilayer
MoS2 field-effect transistors. In contrast, the dichroism is gate-independent
in monolayer MoS2, which is structurally non-centrosymmetric. Our work
demonstrates the ability to continuously vary orbital magnetic moments between
positive and negative values via symmetry control. This represents a new
approach to manipulating Berry-phase effects for applications in quantum

active osteoclasts and active osteoblasts are spatially and temporally coupled.
The refilling of new bone by osteoblasts towards the back of the BMU occurs at
a rate that depends both on the number of osteoblasts and on their secretory
activity. In cortical bone, a linear phenomenological relationship between
matrix apposition rate (MAR) and BMU cavity radius is found experimentally. How
this relationship emerges from the combination of complex, nonlinear
regulations of osteoblast number and secretory activity is unknown.
  Here, we extend our previous mathematical model of cell development within a
single BMU to investigate how osteoblast number and osteoblast secretory
activity vary along the BMU's closing cone. MARs predicted by the model are
compared with data from tetracycline double labelling experiments. We find that
the linear phenomenological relationship observed in these experiments between
MAR and BMU cavity radius holds for most of the refilling phase simulated by
our model, but not near the start and end of refilling. This suggests that at a
particular bone site undergoing remodelling, bone formation starts and ends
rapidly. Our model also suggests that part of the observed cross-sectional
variability in tetracycline data may be due to different bone sites being
refilled by BMUs at different stages of their lifetime. The different stages of
a BMU's lifetime depend on whether the cell populations within the BMU are
still developing or have reached a quasi-steady state while travelling through
bone. We find that due to their longer lifespan, active osteoblasts reach a
quasi-steady distribution more slowly than active osteoclasts. We suggest that
this fact may locally enlarge the Haversian canal diameter (due to a local lack
of osteoblasts compared to osteoclasts) near the BMU's point of origin.

for the first 1.5 years after the discovery. The UBVRI light curves
demonstrated an interesting two-stage evolution during the nebular phase, which
almost flatten out after about 90 days from the optical maximum. SN 2010jl has
one of the highest intrinsic H_alpha luminosity ever recorded for a SN IIn,
especially at late phase, suggesting a strong interaction of SN ejecta with the
dense circumstellar material (CSM) ejected by the progenitor. This is also
indicated by the remarkably strong Balmer lines persisting in the optical
spectra. One interesting spectral evolution about SN 2010jl is the appearance
of asymmetry of the Balmer lines. These lines can be well decomposed into a
narrow component and an intermediate-width component. The intermediate-width
component showed a steady increase in both strength and blueshift with time
until t ~ 400 days after maximum, but it became less blueshifted at t ~ 500
days when the line profile appeared relatively symmetric again. Owing to that a
pure reddening effect will lead to a sudden decline of the light curves and a
progressive blueshift of the spectral lines, we therefore propose that the
asymmetric profiles of H lines seen in SN 2010jl is unlikely due to the
extinction by newly formed dust inside the ejecta, contrary to the explanation
by some early studies. Based on a simple CSM-interaction model, we speculate
that the progenitor of SN 2010jl may suffer a gigantic mass loss (~ 30-50
M_sun) in a few decades before explosion. Considering a slow moving stellar
wind (e.g., ~ 28 km/s) inferred for the preexisting, dense CSM shell and the
extremely high mass-loss rate (1-2 M_sun per yr), we suggest that the
progenitor of SN 2010jl might have experienced a red supergiant stage and
explode finally as a post-red supergiant star with an initial mass above 30-40

narrow line, or maybe two lines and/or an internal bremsstrahlung feature, has
been found in data from the Fermi-LAT satellite detector. As recent analyses
have also shown that there is little sign of extra contributions to continuum
photons, it is natural to investigate leptophilic interacting massive particle
(LIMP) models. We show that a model of radiatively generated neutrino masses
may have the properties needed to explain the Fermi-LAT structure around 130
GeV. This model was proposed some 10 years ago, and predicted a clearly
observable $\gamma$-ray signal in the Fermi-LAT (then GLAST) detector. Here, we
update and improve that analysis, and show as an example that a right-handed
neutrino of mass 135 GeV should give rise to three conspicuous effects: a broad
internal bremsstrahlung bump with maximum around 120 GeV, a 2$\gamma$ line
around 135 GeV, and a $Z\gamma$ line at 119.6 GeV (neglected in the previous
work). These features together give a good fit to the 130 GeV structure, given
the present energy resolution of the Fermi-LAT data. An attractive feature of
the model is that the particle physics properties are essentially fixed, when
relic density and mass of the right-handed neutrino dark matter particle have
been set. Puzzling features of the data at present are a slight displacement of
the signal from the galactic center, and a needed boost factor of order 5-15.
This presents a challenge for numerical simulations including both baryons and
dark matter on scales of 100 pc, and perhaps a need to go beyond the simplest
halo models. With upcoming data, the double-peak structure with the two lines
and the internal bremsstrahlung feature should be seen, if this model is
correct. With the satellite GAMMA-400, a striking fingerprint of this dark
matter candidate should then appear.

the quantum dot from a lead, a polarized current is ejected to others,
similarly to the spin Hall effect. In the absence of magnetic field, the
generation of spin-polarized current requires $N \ge 3$. The polarization is
markedly enhanced by resonant tunneling when the level spacing in the quantum
dot is smaller than the level broadening due to the tunnel coupling to the

broad variety of magnetic field geometries including small scale multipolar and
large scale dipole-dominated topologies. Previous dynamo models suggest that
solutions become multipolar once inertia becomes influential. Being tailored
for terrestrial planets, most of these models neglected the background density
stratification. Aims: we investigate the influence of the density
stratification on convection-driven dynamo models. Methods: three-dimensional
nonlinear simulations of rapidly rotating spherical shells are employed using
the anelastic approximation to incorporate density stratification. A systematic
parametric study for various density stratifications and Rayleigh numbers
allows to explore the dependence of the magnetic field topology on these
parameters. Results: anelastic dynamo models tend to produce a broad range of
magnetic field geometries that fall on two distinct branches with either strong
dipole-dominated or weak multipolar fields. As long as inertia is weak, both
branches can coexist but the dipolar branch vanishes once inertia becomes
influential. The dipolar branch also vanishes for stronger density
stratifications. The reason is the concentration of the convective columns in a
narrow region close to the outer boundary equator, a configuration that favors
non-axisymmetric solutions. In multipolar solutions, zonal flows can become
significant and participate in the toroidal field generation. Parker dynamo
waves may then play an important role close to onset of dynamo action leading
to a cyclic magnetic field behavior. Conclusion: Our simulations also suggest
that the fact that late M dwarfs have dipolar or multipolar magnetic fields can
be explained in two ways. They may differ either by the relative influence of
inertia or fall into the regime where both types of solutions coexist.

decoded using message-passing decoders with limited precision, absorbing sets
have been shown to be a key factor in error floor behavior. Focusing on this
scenario, this paper introduces the cycle consistency matrix (CCM) as a
powerful analytical tool for characterizing and avoiding absorbing sets in
separable circulant-based (SCB) LDPC codes. SCB codes include a wide variety of
regular LDPC codes such as array-based LDPC codes as well as many common
quasi-cyclic codes. As a consequence of its cycle structure, each potential
absorbing set in an SCB LDPC code has a CCM, and an absorbing set can be
present in an SCB LDPC code only if the associated CCM has a nontrivial null
space.
  CCM-based analysis can determine the multiplicity of an absorbing set in an
SCB code and CCM-based constructions avoid certain small absorbing sets
completely. While these techniques can be applied to an SCB code of any rate,
lower-rate SCB codes can usually avoid small absorbing sets because of their
higher variable node degree. This paper focuses attention on the high-rate
scenario in which the CCM constructions provide the most benefit. Simulation
results demonstrate that under limited-precision decoding the new codes have
steeper error-floor slopes and can provide one order of magnitude of
improvement in the low FER region.

assumption of a dilute solution of point ions. There are a number of situations
such as high applied voltages, high concentration of electrolytes, systems with
multivalent ions, or solvent-free ionic liquids where the classical theory is
often applied but the fundamental assumptions cannot be justified. Perhaps the
most basic assumption underlying continuum models in electrokinetics is the
mean-field approximation, that the electric field acting on each discrete ion
is self-consistently determined by the local mean charge density. This paper
considers situations where the mean-field approximation breaks down and
electrostatic correlations become important. A fourth-order modified Poisson
equation is developed that accounts for electrostatic correlations and captures
the essential features in a simple continuum framework. The theory is derived
variationally as a gradient approximation for non-local electrostatics, in
which the dielectric permittivity becomes a differential operator. The only new
parameter is a characteristic length scale for correlated ion pairs. The model
is able to capture subtle aspects of more detailed simulations based on Monte
Carlo, molecular dynamics, or density functional theory and allows for the
straightforward calculation of electrokinetic flows in correlated liquids, for
the first time. Departures from classical Helmholtz-Smoluchowski theory are
controlled by the dimensionless ratio of the correlation length to the Debye
screening length. Charge-density oscillations tend to reduce electro-osmotic
flow and streaming current, and over-screening of the surface charge can lead
to flow reversal. These effects also help to explain the apparent
charge-induced thickening of double layers in induced-charge electrokinetic
phenomena.

<Ecoll>/k > 20 mK, about two orders of magnitude lower than has been achieved
in previous experiments with molecular ions. Choosing N2+ +Rb as a prototypical
system, we find that the reaction rate is independent of the collision energy,
but strongly dependent on the internal state of Rb. Highly efficient charge
exchange about four times faster than the Langevin rate was observed with Rb in
the excited (5p) 2P3/2 state. This observation is rationalized in terms of a
capture process dominated by the charge- quadrupole interaction and a near
resonance between the entrance and exit channels of the reaction. Our results
provide a test of classical models for reactions of molecular ions at the
lowest energies reached thus far.

Particle Hydrodynamics ({\small SPH}) algorithm coupled with a ray-tracing
scheme that calculates the position of the ionisation-front at each timestep.
We present results from simulations performed for three choices of {\small
IR}-flux spanning the range of fluxes emitted by a typical {\small B}-type star
to a cluster of {\small OB}-type stars. The extent of photo-ablation, of
course, depends on the strength of the incident flux and a strong flux of
{\small IR} severely ablates a {\small MC}. Consequently, the first
star-formation sites appear in the dense shocked layer along the edges of the
irradiated cloud. Radiation-induced turbulence readily generates dense
filamentary structure within the photo-ablated cloud although several new
star-forming sites also appear in some of the densest regions at the junctions
of these filaments. Prevalent physical conditions within a {\small MC} play a
crucial role in determining the mode, i.e., filamentary as compared to isolated
pockets, of star-formation, the timescale on which stars form and the
distribution of stellar masses. The probability density functions ({\small
PDF}s) derived for irradiated clouds in this study are intriguing due to their
resemblance with those presented in a recent census of irradiated {\small MC}s.
Furthermore, irrespective of the nature of turbulence, the protostellar
mass-functions({\small MF}s) derived in this study follow a power-law
distribution. When turbulence within the cloud is driven by a relatively strong
flux of {\small IR} such as that emitted by a massive {\small O}-type star or a
cluster of such stars, the {\small MF} approaches the canonical form due to
Salpeter, and even turns-over for protostellar masses smaller than $\sim$0.2

of the trigger and the propagation of shallow landslides caused by rainfall. We
used a Molecular Dynamics (MD) inspired model, similar to discrete element
method (DEM), that is suitable to model granular material and to observe the
trajectory of single particle, so to identify its dynamical properties. We
consider that the triggering of shallow landslides is caused by the decrease of
the static friction along the sliding surface due to water infiltration by
rainfall. Thence the triggering is caused by two following conditions: (a) a
threshold speed of the particles and (b) a condition on the static friction,
between particles and slope surface, based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure
criterion. The latter static condition is used in the geotechnical model to
estimate the possibility of landslide triggering. Finally the interaction force
between particles is defined trough a potential that, in the absence of
experimental data, we have modeled as the Lennard-Jones 2-1 potential. In the
model the viscosity is also introduced and for a large range of values of the
model's parameters, we observe a characteristic velocity pattern, with
acceleration increments, typical of real landslides. The results of simulations
are quite promising: the energy and the time triggering distributions of local
avalanches shows a power law distribution, analogous to the observed
Gutenberg-Richter and Omori power law distributions for earthquakes. Finally it
is possible to apply the method of the inverse surface displacement velocity
[Fukuzono 1985] for predicting the failure time.

overabundant information for online users. Though the information filtering for
the online commercial systems received much attention recently, almost all of
the previous works are dedicated to design new algorithms and consider the
user-item bipartite networks as given and constant information. However, many
problems for recommender systems such as the cold-start problem (i.e. low
recommendation accuracy for the small degree items) are actually due to the
limitation of the underlying user-item bipartite networks. In this letter, we
propose a strategy to enhance the performance of the already existing
recommendation algorithms by directly manipulating the user-item bipartite
networks, namely adding some virtual connections to the networks. Numerical
analyses on two benchmark data sets, MovieLens and Netflix, show that our
method can remarkably improve the recommendation performance. Specifically, it
not only improve the recommendations accuracy (especially for the small degree
items), but also help the recommender systems generate more diverse and novel
recommendations.

The nebula shows an elliptical shape with an inner semi-major axis $\sim$ 0.45

torus-like or a ring-like shell structure around the nova. There is also a

binary is $\sim$ 0.003 c s$^{-1}$ over the 0.2-9.0 keV energy range. The best

bibliometric indicators need to normalize for such differences between fields

Traditionally, normalization for field differences has usually been done based
on a field classification system. In this approach, each publication belongs to
one or more fields and the citation impact of a publication is calculated
relative to the other publications in the same field. Recently, the idea of
source normalization was introduced, which offers an alternative approach to
normalize for field differences. In this approach, normalization is done by
looking at the referencing behavior of citing publications or citing journals.
In this paper, we provide an overview of a number of source normalization

attention to the issue of the selection of the journals to be included in a

possibility of interference among several transmitting nodes. Much important
research has been invested in decreasing the number of collisions in order to
obtain faster algorithms for communication in such networks.
  This paper proposes a novel approach for wireless communication, which
embraces collisions rather than avoiding them, over an additive channel. It
introduces a coding technique called Bounded-Contention Coding (BCC) that
allows collisions to be successfully decoded by the receiving nodes into the
original transmissions and whose complexity depends on a bound on the
contention among the transmitters.
  BCC enables deterministic local broadcast in a network with n nodes and at
most a transmitters with information of l bits each within O(a log n + al) bits
of communication with full-duplex radios, and O((a log n + al)(log n)) bits,
with high probability, with half-duplex radios. When combined with random
linear network coding, BCC gives global broadcast within O((D + a + log n)(a
log n + l)) bits, with high probability. This also holds in dynamic networks
that can change arbitrarily over time by a worst-case adversary. When no bound
on the contention is given, it is shown how to probabilistically estimate it
and obtain global broadcast that is adaptive to the true contention in the
network.

intrinsic helical structure is stabilized with length and temperature for a

range n=4-8 not just due to enthalpic factors (hydrogen bonds and their
cooperativity, van der Waals dispersion interactions, electrostatics), but
importantly also by a vibrational entropic stabilization over competing
conformers at room temperature. The stabilization is shown to be due to softer
low-frequency vibrational modes in helical conformers than in more compact
ones. This observation is corroborated by including anharmonic effects
explicitly through \emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics, and generalized by
testing different terminations and considering larger helical peptide models.

presented. The single-differential cross-sections d(sigma)/dQ2, d(sigma)/dx and
d(sigma)/dy and the reduced cross-section were measured in the kinematic region
Q2 > 185 GeV2 and y < 0.9, where Q2 is the four-momentum transfer squared, x
the Bjorken scaling variable, and y the inelasticity of the interaction. The
measurements were performed separately for positively and negatively polarised
positron beams. The measurements are based on an integrated luminosity of 135.5
pb-1 collected with the ZEUS detector in 2006 and 2007 at a centre-of-mass
energy of 318 GeV. The structure functions F3 and F3(gamma)Z were determined by
combining the e+p results presented in this paper with previously published e-p
neutral current results. The asymmetry parameter A+ is used to demonstrate the
parity violation predicted in electroweak interactions. The measurements are
well described by the predictions of the Standard Model.

  We extend the halo-occupation formalism to model the cross-correlation
function between a galaxy sample of interest and multiple tracer populations
simultaneously. This method can be applied to commonly used luminosity
threshold samples as well as to color and luminosity bin selected galaxy
samples, and improves the accuracy of clustering analyses for sparse galaxy
populations.
  We confirm the previously observed trend that red galaxies reside in more
massive halos and are more likely to be satellite galaxies than average
galaxies of similar luminosity. While the change in central galaxy host mass as
a function of color is only weakly constrained, the satellite fraction and
characteristic halo masses of green satellite galaxies are found to be
intermediate between those of blue and red satellite galaxies.

a similar formation mechanism as the one accepted for low mass stars. However,
larger databases and more systematic studies are needed before strong
conclusions can be reached. Aims. In this second paper of a series devoted to
the study of the spectroscopic properties of the members of the Lambda Orionis
Star Forming Region, we study accretion, activity and rotation for a wide set
of spectroscopically confirmed members of the central star cluster Collinder 69
to draw analogies and/or differences between the brown dwarf and stellar
populations of this cluster. Moreover, we present comparisons with other star
forming regions of similar and different ages to address environmental effects
on our conclusions. Methods. We study prominent photospheric lines to derive
rotational velocities and emission lines to distinguish between accretion
processes and chromospheric activity. In addition, we include information about
disk presence and X-ray emission. Results. We report very large differences in
the disk fractions of low mass stars and brown dwarfs (~58%) when compared to
higher mass stars (26+4-3%) with 0.6 Msun being the critical mass we find for
this dichotomy. As a byproduct, we address the implications of the spatial
distribution of disk and diskless members in the formation scenario of the
cluster itself. We have used the Halpha emission to discriminate among
accreting and non-accreting sources finding that 38+8-7% of sources harboring
disks undergo active accretion and that his percentage stays similar in the
substellar regime. For those sources we have estimated accretion rates.
Finally, regarding rotational velocities, we find a high dispersion in vsin(i)
which is even larger among the diskless population.

programs against the Total Store Ordering (TSO) memory model. A program is
robust if all its TSO computations correspond to computations under the
Sequential Consistency (SC) semantics.
  We provide a complete characterization of non-robustness in terms of
so-called attacks: a restricted form of (harmful) out-of-program-order
executions. Then, we show that detecting attacks can be parallelized, and can
be solved using state reachability queries under SC semantics in a suitably
instrumented program obtained by a linear size source-to-source translation.
Importantly, the construction is valid for an arbitrary number of addresses and
an arbitrary number of parallel threads, and it is independent from the data
domain and from the size of store buffers in the TSO semantics. In particular,
when the data domain is finite and the number of addresses is fixed, we obtain
decidability and complexity results for robustness, even for an arbitrary
number of threads.
  As a second contribution, we provide an algorithm for computing an optimal
set of fences that enforce robustness. We consider two criteria of optimality:
minimization of program size and maximization of its performance. The
algorithms we define are implemented, and we successfully applied them to
analyzing and correcting several concurrent algorithms.

of magnitude. In this issue of PNAS, Hanasoge et al. (2012) employ recent
helioseismic observations to derive stringent empirical constraints on the

but communities are reliable only if they are statistically significant. To
detect statistically significant communities, a common approach is to resample
the original network and analyze the communities. But resampling assumes
independence between samples, while the components of a network are inherently
dependent. Therefore, we must understand how breaking dependencies between
resampled components affects the results of the significance analysis. Here we
use scientific communication as a model system to analyze this effect. Our
dataset includes citations among articles published in journals in the years
1984-2010. We compare parametric resampling of citations with non-parametric
article resampling. While citation resampling breaks link dependencies, article
resampling maintains such dependencies. We find that citation resampling
underestimates the variance of link weights. Moreover, this underestimation
explains most of the differences in the significance analysis of ranking and
clustering. Therefore, when only link weights are available and article
resampling is not an option, we suggest a simple parametric resampling scheme
that generates link-weight variances close to the link-weight variances of
article resampling. Nevertheless, when we highlight and summarize important
structural changes in science, the more dependencies we can maintain in the
resampling scheme, the earlier we can predict structural change.

  The kernel $K_1$ of the transmutation operator relating

written texts. As a first step, a one-dimensional system is examined : two
written texts by one author (Lewis Carroll) are considered, together with one
translation, into an artificial language, i.e. Esperanto are mapped into time
series. Their corresponding shuffled versions are used for obtaining a ""base
line"". Two different one-dimensional time series are used here: (i) one based
on word lengths (LTS), (ii) the other on word frequencies (FTS). It is shown
that the generalized Hurst exponent $h(q)$ and the derived $f(\alpha)$ curves
of the original and translated texts show marked differences. The original
""texts"" are far from giving a parabolic $f(\alpha)$ function, - in contrast to
the shuffled texts. Moreover, the Esperanto text has more extreme values. This
suggests cascade model-like, with multiscale time asymmetric features as
finally written texts. A discussion of the difference and complementarity of
mapping into a LTS or FTS is presented. The FTS $f(\alpha)$ curves are more
opened than the LTS ones

Montroll's adaptation of Verhulst equation is more like an economic field
description than a ""social force"". The empirical Verhulst logistic function and
the Gompertz double exponential law are used here in order to present an
alternative view, within a similar mechanistic physics framework. As an
example, a ""social force"" modifying the rate in the number of temples

1940 in Belgium is found and quantified. Practically, two temple inauguration
regimes are seen to exist over different time spans, separated by a gap
attributed to a specific ""constraint"", a taxation system, but allowing for a
different, smooth, evolution rather than a jump. The impulse force duration is
also emphasized as being better taken into account within the Gompertz
framework. Moreover, a ""social force"" can be as here, attributed to a change in
the limited need/capacity of some population, coupled to some external field,
in either Verhulst or Gompertz equation, rather than resulting from already

this faithful representation of the kinematics of the tri-layer FeAs or FeSe
structure, the model provides answers and physical pictures to fundamental
questions related to the robustness of superconductivity and pairing symmetry,
unifies different families of iron-based superconductors, casts new insight
into the connections to the other high $T_c$ superconductors, cuprates, and
reveals why an s-wave pairing can be stabilized by repulsive interactions.
Further progresses include that the model provides a clean understanding of
band reconstruction observed in magnetically ordered states, which is a strong
support to the kinematics of the $S_4$ model, and captures the essential low
energy physics of iron-based superconductors based on numerical results from
unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulation.

leading idea is to describe the trading of these goods by means of some
fundamental rules in price theory, in particular by using Cobb-Douglas utility
functions for the binary exchange, and the Edgeworth box for the description of
the common exchange area in which utility is increasing for both agents. This
leads to a Boltzmann-type equation in which the post-interaction variables
depend in a nonlinear way from the pre-interaction ones. Other models will be
derived, by suitably linearizing this Boltzmann equation. In presence of
uncertainty in the exchanges, it is shown that the solution to some of the
linearized kinetic equations develop Pareto tails, where the Pareto index
depends on the ratio between the gain and the variance of the uncertainty. In
particular, the result holds true for the solution of a drift-diffusion
equation of Fokker-Planck type, obtained from the linear Boltzmann equation as
the limit of quasi-invariant trades.
