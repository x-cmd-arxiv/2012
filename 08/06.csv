described by the fourth rank elasticity tensor C. The decomposition of C into a
partially symmetric tensor M and a partially antisymmetric tensors N is often
used in the literature. An alternative, less well-known decomposition, into the
completely symmetric part S of C plus the reminder A, turns out to be
irreducible under the 3-dimensional general linear group. We show that the
SA-decomposition is unique, irreducible, and preserves the symmetries of the

applications of the SA-decomposition are discussed: the Cauchy relations
(vanishing of A), the non-existence of elastic null Lagrangians, the
decomposition of the elastic energy and of the acoustic wave propagation. The
acoustic or Christoffel tensor is split in a Cauchy and a non-Cauchy part. The
Cauchy part governs the longitudinal wave propagation. We provide explicit
examples of the effectiveness of the SA-decomposition. A complete class of
anisotropic media is proposed that allows pure polarizations in arbitrary
directions, similarly as in an isotropic medium.

Step Kinetic Monte Carlo (FS-KMC) algorithms proposed in [1] for the parallel

fractional step algorithms with a time-stepping window $\Delta t$, and as such
they are inherently partially asynchronous since there is no processor
communication during the period $\Delta t$. In this contribution we primarily
focus on the error analysis of FS-KMC algorithms as approximations of
conventional, serial kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). A key aspect of our analysis
relies on emphasising a goal-oriented approach for suitably defined macroscopic
observables (e.g., density, energy, correlations, surface roughness), rather
than focusing on strong topology estimates for individual trajectories.
  One of the key implications of our error analysis is that it allows us to
address systematically the processor communication of different parallelization
strategies for KMC by comparing their (partial) asynchrony, which in turn is
measured by their respective fractional time step $\Delta t$ for a prescribed
error tolerance.

context of signal transduction. The model consists of input-output transfer
functions, which are derived from differential equations, using stable
equilibria. We select a set of 'source' species, which receive input signals.
Signals are transmitted to all other species in the system (the 'target'
species) with a specific delay and transmission strength. The delay is computed
as the maximal reaction time until a stable equilibrium for the target species
is reached, in the context of all other reactions in the system. The
transmission strength is the concentration change of the target species. The
computed input-output transfer functions can be stored in a matrix, fitted with
parameters, and recalled to build discrete dynamical models. By separating
reaction time and concentration we can greatly simplify the model,
circumventing typical problems of complex dynamical systems. The transfer
function transformation can be applied to mass-action kinetic models of signal
transduction. The paper shows that this approach yields significant insight,
while remaining an executable dynamical model for signal transduction. In
particular we can deconstruct the complex system into local transfer functions
between individual species. As an example, we examine modularity and signal
integration using a published model of striatal neural plasticity. The modules
that emerge correspond to a known biological distinction between
calcium-dependent and cAMP-dependent pathways. We also found that overall
interconnectedness depends on the magnitude of input, with high connectivity at
low input and less connectivity at moderate to high input. This general result,
which directly follows from the properties of individual transfer functions,
contradicts notions of ubiquitous complexity by showing input-dependent signal
transmission inactivation.

recovery of low-dimensional models or the learning of manifolds underlying sets
of data. Many manifold learning methods require the estimation of the tangent
space of the manifold at a point from locally available data samples. Local
sampling conditions such as (i) the size of the neighborhood (sampling width)
and (ii) the number of samples in the neighborhood (sampling density) affect
the performance of learning algorithms. In this work, we propose a theoretical
analysis of local sampling conditions for the estimation of the tangent space
at a point P lying on a m-dimensional Riemannian manifold S in R^n. Assuming a
smooth embedding of S in R^n, we estimate the tangent space T_P S by performing
a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on points sampled from the neighborhood of
P on S. Our analysis explicitly takes into account the second order properties
of the manifold at P, namely the principal curvatures as well as the higher
order terms. We consider a random sampling framework and leverage recent
results from random matrix theory to derive conditions on the sampling width
and the local sampling density for an accurate estimation of tangent subspaces.
We measure the estimation accuracy by the angle between the estimated tangent
space and the true tangent space T_P S and we give conditions for this angle to
be bounded with high probability. In particular, we observe that the local
sampling conditions are highly dependent on the correlation between the
components in the second-order local approximation of the manifold. We finally
provide numerical simulations to validate our theoretical findings.

during inflation is necessary for the correct interpretation of measurements of
non-Gaussian correlations in the cosmic microwave background and the
large-scale structure of the universe. The ""{\delta}N formalism"" is a popular
and powerful technique for computing non-linear evolution of cosmological
perturbations on large scales. In particular, it enables us to compute the
curvature perturbation, {\zeta}, on large scales without actually solving
perturbed field equations. However, people often wonder why this is the case.
In order for this approach to be valid, the perturbed Hamiltonian constraint
and matter-field equations on large scales must, with a suitable choice of
coordinates, take on the same forms as the corresponding unperturbed equations.
We find that this is possible when (1) the unperturbed metric is given by a
homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric; and (2)
on large scales and with a suitable choice of coordinates, one can ignore the
shift vector (g0i) as well as time-dependence of tensor perturbations to
gij/a2(t) of the perturbed metric. While the first condition has to be assumed
a priori, the second condition can be met when (3) the anisotropic stress
becomes negligible on large scales. However, in order to explicitly show that
the second condition follows from the third condition, one has to use
gravitational field equations, and thus this statement may depend on the
details of theory of gravitation. Finally, as the {\delta}N formalism uses only
the Hamiltonian constraint and matter-field equations, it does not a priori
respect the momentum constraint. We show that the violation of the momentum
constraint only yields a decaying mode solution for {\zeta}, and the violation
vanishes when the slow-roll conditions are satisfied.

between current density and vector potential [1], which has many deep
consequences. Amongst them, one can speculate that superconductors in a
magnetic field ""find an equilibrium state where the sum of kinetic and magnetic
energies is minimum"" and this state ""corresponds to the expulsion of the
magnetic field"" [2]. This statement still leaves an open question: from which
source is superconducting current acquiring its kinetic energy? A na\""ive
answer, perhaps, is from the energy of the magnetic field.
  However, one can consider situations (Aharonov-Bohm effect), where the
classical magnetic field is absent in the space area where the current is being
set up. Experiments demonstrate [3] that despite the local absence of magnetic
field, current is, nevertheless, building up. From what source is it acquiring
its energy then? Locally, only a vector potential is present. How does the
vector potential facilitate the formation of the current?
  Is the current formation a result of truly non-local quantum action, or does
the local action of the vector potential have experimental consequences, which
are measurable quasi-locally?
  We discuss possible experiments with a hybrid normal-metal superconductor
circuitry, which can clarify this puzzling situation. Experimental answers
would be important for further theoretical developments.

propagation in the presence of spatial inhomogeneity, driving electric field
and the spin orbit coupling in semiconductor quantum wells in a wide range of
temperature regime based on the kinetic spin Bloch equation. It is analytically
shown that under an applied electric field, the spin density wave gains a
time-dependent phase shift $\phi(t)$. Without the spin-orbit coupling, the
phase shift increases linearly with time and is equivalent to a normal Doppler
shift in optical measurements. Due to the joint effect of spin-orbit coupling
and the applied electric field, the phase shift behaviors differently at the
early and the later stages. At the early stage, the phase shifts are the same
with or without the spin-orbit coupling. While at the later stage, the phase
shift deviates from the normal Doppler one when the spin-orbit coupling is
present. The crossover time from the early normal Doppler behavior to the
anomalous one at the later stage is inversely proportional to the spin
diffusion coefficient, wave vector of the spin density wave and the spin-orbit
coupling strength. In the high temperature regime, the crossover time becomes
large as a result of the decreased spin diffusion coefficient. The analytic
results capture all the quantitative features of the experimental results,
while the full numerical calculations agree quantitatively well with the
experimental data obtained from the Doppler velocimetry of spin propagation
[Yang {\it et al.}, Nat. Phys. {\bf 8}, 153 (2012)]. We further predict that
the coherent spin precession, originally thought to be broken down at high
temperature, is robust up to the room temperature for narrow quantum wells. We
point out that one has to carry out the experiments longer to see the effect of
the coherent spin precession at higher temperature due to the larger crossover
time.

frequency of agreement between coders to account for agreement which simply
occurs by chance. However, in some situations these measures exhibit behavior
which make their values difficult to interprete. These properties, e.g. the
""annotator bias"" or the ""problem of prevalence"", refer to a tendency of some of
these measures to indicate counterintuitive high or low values of reliability
depending on conditions which many researchers consider as unrelated to
inter-coder reliability. However, not all researchers agree with this view, and
since there is no commonly accepted formal definition of inter-coder
reliability, it is hard to decide whether this depends upon a different concept
of reliability or simply upon flaws in the measuring algorithms.
  In this note we therefore take an axiomatic approach: we introduce a model
for the rating of items by several coders according to a nominal scale. Based
upon this model we define inter-coder reliability as a probability to assign a
category to an item with certainty. We then discuss under which conditions this
notion of inter-coder reliability is uniquely determined given typical
experimental results, i.e. relative frequencies of category assignments by
different coders.
  In addition we provide an algorithm and conduct numerical simulations which
exhibit the accuracy of this algorithm under different model parameter
settings.

two centuries and has yet to be resolved. The ""Rhineland Hypothesis"" proposes
that Eastern European Jews emerged from a small group of German Jews who
migrated eastward and expanded rapidly. Alternatively, the ""Khazarian
Hypothesis"" suggests that Eastern European descended from Judean tribes who
joined the Khazars, an amalgam of Turkic clans that settled the Caucasus in the
early centuries CE and converted to Judaism in the 8th century. The Judaized
Empire was continuously reinforced with Mesopotamian and Greco-Roman Jews until
the 13th century. Following the collapse of their empire, the Judeo-Khazars
fled to Eastern Europe. The rise of European Jewry is therefore explained by
the contribution of the Judeo-Khazars. Thus far, however, their contribution
has been estimated only empirically; the absence of genome-wide data from
Caucasus populations precluded testing the Khazarian Hypothesis. Recent
sequencing of modern Caucasus populations prompted us to revisit the Khazarian
Hypothesis and compare it with the Rhineland Hypothesis. We applied a wide
range of population genetic analyses - including principal component,
biogeographical origin, admixture, identity by descent, allele sharing
distance, and uniparental analyses - to compare these two hypotheses. Our
findings support the Khazarian Hypothesis and portray the European Jewish
genome as a mosaic of Caucasus, European, and Semitic ancestries, thereby
consolidating previous contradictory reports of Jewish ancestry.

current density, barrier layer thickness and the concentration of metal vacancy

point defect model and the present variant are also highlighted. The empirical
parameters alpha and beta in the original point defect model are replaced with
two physical parameters Rcont and Rhof which represent respectively the
electronic contact resistance at the metal/film interface and the electronic
resistivity of the oxide film. The present variant correctly describes the
annihilation of the metal vacancies at the metal/film interface and also
enforces the conservation of particle and defect volumes during the solid-state
reactions leading to the natural inclusion of the famous Pilling-Bedsworth
ratio RPB into the model. Diagnostics which help to check the model predictions
with experiments are given. Use of this variant to describe stress-induced
failure of the barrier oxide leading to pitting is also discussed.

region (AR) 11158 that are strongly modulated by the local magnetic field as
observed with the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO). A small bipole emerged in
the sunspot complex and subsequently created a quadrupolar flux system.
Non-linear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation from vector magnetograms
reveals its energetic nature: the fast-shearing bipole accumulated ~2e31 erg
free energy (10% of AR total) over just one day despite its relatively small
magnetic flux (5% of AR total). During the eruption, the ejected plasma
followed a highly inclined trajectory, over 60 degrees with respect to the
radial direction, forming a jet-like, inverted-Y shaped structure in its wake.
Field extrapolation suggests complicated magnetic connectivity with a coronal
null point, which is favorable of reconnection between different flux
components in the quadrupolar system. Indeed, multiple pairs of flare ribbons
brightened simultaneously, and coronal reconnection signatures appeared near
the inferred null. Part of the magnetic setting resembles that of a
blowout-type jet; the observed inverted-Y structure likely outlines the open
field lines along the separatrix surface. Owing to the asymmetrical
photospheric flux distribution, the confining magnetic pressure decreases much
faster horizontally than upward. This special field geometry likely guided the
non-radial eruption during its initial stage.

parameters, such as a doublon-holon binding factor indispensable to describe
correlated SC and normal states as doped Mott insulators. U/t, t'/t and \delta

As U/t increases, a sharp crossover of SC properties occurs at U_co/t \sim 10
from a conventional BCS type to a kinetic-energy-driven type for any t'/t. As
\delta decreases, U_co/t is smoothly connected to the Mott transition point at
half filling. For U/t\lsim 5, steady superconductivity corresponding to the
cuprates is not found, whereas the d-wave SC correlation function Pd^\infty
rapidly increases for U/t\gsim 6 and becomes maximum at U=U_co. Comparing the
\delta dependence of Pd^\infty with experimentally observed dome-shaped Tc and
condensation energy, we find that the effective value of $U$ for the cuprates
should be larger than the band width, for which the t-J model is valid.
Analyzing the kinetic energy, we reveal that for U>U_co only doped holes
(electrons) become charge carriers, which will make a small Fermi surface (hole
pocket), but for U<U_co all the electrons (holes) contribute to conduction and
will make an ordinary large Fermi surface, which is contradictory to the
feature of cuprates. By introducing a proper negative (positive) t'/t, the SC

order to investigate the cause of the dispersion, in this paper, we select five
nearby spiral galaxies, and perform spatially resolved studies on each of the
galaxies, with a combination of ultraviolet and infrared imaging data. We
measure all positions within each galaxy and divide the extracted regions into
young and evolved stellar populations. By means of this approach, we attempt to
discover separate effects of dust attenuation and stellar population age on the
IRX-UV relation for individual galaxies. In this work, in addition to dust
attenuation, stellar population age is interpreted to be another parameter in
the IRX-UV function, and the diversity of star formation histories is suggested
to disperse the age effects. At the same time, strong evidence shows the
necessity of more parameters in the interpretation of observational data, such
as variations in attenuation/extinction law. Fractional contributions of
different components to the integrated luminosities of the galaxies suggest
that the integrated measurements of galaxies which comprise different
populations would weaken the effect of the age parameter on IRX-UV diagrams.
The dependance of the IRX-UV relation on luminosity and radial distance in
galaxies presents weak trends, which offers an implication of selective
effects. The two-dimensional maps of the UV color and the
infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio are displayed and show a disparity in the spatial
distributions between the two parameters in galaxies, which offers a spatial
interpretation of the scatter in the IRX-UV relation.

in M\'armol-Queralt\'o (2011, henceforth Paper I). All the galaxies were
observed using Integral Field Spectroscopy with a similar setup, covering their
optical extension up to \sim2.4 effective radii within a wavelength range from
\sim3700 to \sim6900{\AA}. We develop a new automatic procedure to detect H ii
regions, based on the contrast of the H{\alpha} intensity maps. Once detected,
the procedure provides us with the integrated spectra of each individual
segmented region. A well-tested automatic decoupling procedure has been applied
to remove the underlying stellar population, deriving the main proper- ties of
the strongest emission lines in the considered wavelength range (covering from
[O ii] {\lambda}3727 to [S ii] {\lambda}6731). A final catalogue of the
spectroscopic properties of these regions has been created for each galaxy. In
the current study we focused on the understanding of the average properties of
the H ii regions and their radial distributions. We find that the gas-phase
oxygen abundance and the H{\alpha} equivalent width present negative and
positive gradient, respectively. The distribution of slopes is statistically
compatible with a random Gaussian distribution around the mean value, if the
radial distances are measured in units of the respective effective radius. No
difference in the slope is found for galaxies of different morphologies:
barred/non-barred, grand-design/flocculent. Therefore, the effective radius is
a universal scale length for gradients in the evolution of galaxies. Other
properties have a larger variance across each object.

spectrum of SgrA*, we use a sample of simultaneous NIR/X-ray flare peaks and
model the flares using a synchrotron and SSC mechanism. The observations reveal
flaring activity in all wavelength bands that can be modeled as the signal from
adiabatically expanding synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) components. The model
parameters suggest that either the adiabatically expanding source components
have a bulk motion larger than v_exp or the expanding material contributes to a
corona or disk, confined to the immediate surroundings of SgrA*. For the bulk
of the synchrotron and SSC models, we find synchrotron turnover frequencies in
the range 300-400 GHz. For the pure synchrotron models this results in
densities of relativistic particles of the order of 10^6.5 cm^-3 and for the
SSC models, the median densities are about one order of magnitude higher.
However, to obtain a realistic description of the frequency-dependent
variability amplitude of SgrA*, models with higher turnover frequencies and
even higher densities are required. We discuss the results in the framework of
possible deviations from equilibrium between particle and magnetic field

degree of high column density partial coverer in order to fully model the hard

resulting from Fe XXV and Fe XXVI. A further four AGN feature highly ionized Fe
K absorbers consistent with zero outflow velocity, making a total of 14/46
(30%) AGN in this sample showing evidence for statistically significant
absorption in the Fe K region.
  Narrow Fe K alpha emission from distant material at 6.4 keV is found to be
almost ubiquitous in these AGN. Examining the 6-7 keV Fe K region we note that
narrow emission lines originating from Fe XXV at 6.63-6.70 keV and from Fe XXVI

an average emissivity index of q=2.4\pm0.1 and equivalent width EW=96\pm10 eV

determine. In such cases, one can resort to so-called choice functions. They
provide a means to determine which options in a particular set are optimal, and
allow incomparability among any number of options. Applying choice functions in
sequential decision problems can be highly non-trivial, as the usual properties
of maximising expected utility may no longer be satisfied. In this paper, we
study one of these properties: we revisit and reinterpret Selten's concept of
subgame perfectness in the context of decision trees, leading us to the concept
of subtree perfectness, which basically says that the optimal solution of a
decision tree should not depend on any larger tree it may be embedded in. In
other words, subtree perfectness excludes counterfactual reasoning, and
therefore may be desirable from some philosophical points of view. Subtree
perfectness is also desirable from a practical point of view, because it admits
efficient algorithms for solving decision trees, such as backward induction.
The main contribution of this paper is a very simple non-technical criterion
for determining whether any given choice function will satisfy subtree
perfectness or not. We demonstrate the theorem and illustrate subtree
perfectness, or the lack thereof, through numerous examples, for a wide variety
of choice functions, where incomparability amongst strategies can be caused by
imprecision in either probabilities or utilities. We find that almost no choice
function, except for maximising expected utility, satisfies it in general. We
also find that choice functions other than maximising expected utility can
satisfy it, provided that we restrict either the structure of the tree, or the
structure of the choice function.

complex phenomena that are observed in the cuprate and iron-based
high-temperature superconductors. Simulations of these models therefore provide
an ideal framework to study and understand the superconducting properties of
these systems and the mechanisms responsible for them. Here we review recent
dynamic cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations of these models, which provide
an unbiased view of the leading correlations in the system. In particular, we
discuss what these simulations tell us about superconductivity in the
homogeneous 2D single-orbital Hubbard model, and how charge stripes affect this
behavior. We then describe recent simulations of a bilayer Hubbard model, which
provides a simple model to study the type and nature of pairing in systems with
multiple Fermi surfaces such as the iron-based superconductors.

Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation (GMOR) are obtained using weighted QCD Finite
Energy Sum Rules (FESR) involving the pseudoscalar current correlator. Two
types of integration kernels in the FESR are used to suppress the contribution
of the kaon radial excitations to the hadronic spectral function, one with
local and the other with global constraints. The result for the pseudoscalar
current correlator at zero momentum is $\psi_5(0) = (2.8 \pm 0.3) \times
10^{-3} GeV^{4}$, leading to the chiral corrections to GMOR: $\delta_K = (55
\pm 5)%$. The resulting uncertainties are mostly due to variations in the upper
limit of integration in the FESR, within the stability regions, and to a much
lesser extent due to the uncertainties in the strong coupling and the strange
quark mass. Higher order quark mass corrections, vacuum condensates, and the
hadronic resonance sector play a negligible role in this determination. These
results confirm an independent determination from chiral perturbation theory
giving also very large corrections, i.e. roughly an order of magnitude larger
than the corresponding corrections in chiral $SU(2) \times SU(2)$. Combining
these results with our previous determination of the corrections to GMOR in
chiral $SU(2) \times SU(2)$, $\delta_\pi$, we are able to determine two low
energy constants of chiral perturbation theory, i.e. $L^r_8 = (1.0 \pm 0.3)
\times 10^{-3}$, and $H^r_2 = - (4.7 \pm 0.6) \times 10^{-3}$, both at the
scale of the $\rho$-meson mass.

terms of generalized/4x4 transfer and scattering matrices. Results are
presented for a planar dielectric multilayer of arbitrary refractive index

lateral and normal velocity-dependent components which may depend in a subtle
way on the Doppler effect and TE-TM polarization mixing. For lateral
displacements in particular, polarization mixing, which is here interpreted as
an effective magneto-electric effect due to the reduced symmetry induced by the
motion of the slab, gives rise to a velocity dependent force contribution that
is sensitive to the phase difference between the two polarization amplitudes.
This term gives rise to a rather peculiar optical response on the moving body
and specific caseses are illustrated for incident radiation of arbitrarily
directed linear polarization. The additional force due to polarization mixing
may cancel to first order in V/c with the first order Doppler contribution
yielding an overall vanishing of the velocity-dependent component of the force
on the body. The above findings bare some relevance to modern developments of
nano-optomechanics as well as to the problem of a frictional component to the

when the number variables runs into the thousands, and so even two-way
interactions number in the millions, these methods may become computationally
infeasible. Typically variable screening based on model fits using only main
effects must be performed first. One problem with screening is that important
variables may be missed if they are only useful for prediction when certain
interaction terms are also present in the model.
  To tackle this issue, we introduce a new method we call Backtracking. It can
be incorporated into many existing high-dimensional methods based on penalty
functions, and works by building increasing sets of candidate interactions
iteratively. Models fitted on the main effects and interactions selected early
on in this process guide the selection of future interactions. By also making
use of previous fits for computation, as well as performing calculations is
parallel, the overall run-time of the algorithm can be greatly reduced.
  The effectiveness of our method when applied to regression and classification
problems is demonstrated on simulated and real data sets. In the case of using

$\su(X)\leq\mu(X)\leq\su(X)^+$. We also introduce the class $\mathcal C_\kappa$

relativistic and ultra-relativistic cosmic rays in the background magnetic
field in the multi-fluid approach. Cosmic rays can be both electrons and ions.
The drift speed of cosmic rays is directed along the magnetic field. In
equilibrium, the return current of the background plasma is taken into account.
One-dimensional perturbations parallel to the magnetic field are considered.
The dispersion relations are derived for transverse and longitudinal
perturbations. It is shown that the back-reaction of magnetized cosmic rays
generates new instabilities one of which has the growth rate that can approach
the growth rate of the Bell instability. These new instabilities can be
stronger than the cyclotron resonance instability. For unmagnetized cosmic
rays, the growth rate is analogous to the Bell one. We compare two models of
the plasma return current in equilibrium with three and four charged
components. Some difference between these models is demonstrated. For
longitudinal perturbations, an instability is found in the case of
ultra-relativistic cosmic rays. The results obtained can be applied to
investigation of astrophysical objects such as the shocks by supernova
remnants, galaxy clusters, intracluster medium and so on, where interaction of
cosmic rays with turbulence of the electron-ion plasma produced by them is of a
great importance for the cosmic-ray evolution.

maximize the performance (i.e. clicks, actions) under the current budget

constructed from the regularized expressions of the propagators that reproduce
both the resummed behavior in the high-k limit and the standard PT results at
low-k. With the help of N-body simulations, we show that such a construction
gives robust and accurate predictions for both the density power spectrum and
the correlation function at percent-level in the weakly non-linear regime. We
then present an algorithm that allows accelerated evaluations of all the
required diagrams by reducing the computational tasks to one-dimensional
integrals. This is achieved by means of pre-computed kernel sets defined for
appropriately chosen fiducial models. The computational time for two-loop
results is then reduced from a few minutes, with the direct method, to a few
seconds with the fast one. The robustness and applicability of this method are
tested against the power spectrum cosmic emulator from which a wide variety of
cosmological models can be explored. The fortran program with which direct and

describing the transition between the pre-radiation era and the radiation era.
The universe starts from $t=-\infty$ but, when $t<0$, its size is less than the
Planck length $l_P=1.62 10^{-35} m$. The universe undergoes an inflationary
expansion that brings it to a size $a_1=2.61 10^{-6} m$ on a timescale of a few
Planck times $t_P=5.39 10^{-44} s$. When $t\gg t_P$, the universe decelerates

decelerating universe dominated by baryonic and dark matter to an accelerating
universe dominated by dark energy (second inflation). The transition takes
place at a size $a_2=8.95 10^{25} m$ corresponding to a time of the order of
the cosmological time $t_{\Lambda}=1.46 10^{18} s$. This polytropic model
reveals a nice ""symmetry"" between the early and late evolution of the universe,
the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in the late universe playing a role similar
to the Planck constant $\hbar$ in the early universe. We interpret the
cosmological constant as a fundamental constant of nature describing the

Planck density and the cosmological density represent fundamental upper and
lower bounds differing by ${122}$ orders of magnitude. The cosmological

linear learning and sublinear time near-neighbor search. The major drawback of
minwise hashing is the expensive preprocessing cost, as the method requires
applying (e.g.,) k=200 to 500 permutations on the data. The testing time can
also be expensive if a new data point (e.g., a new document or image) has not
been processed, which might be a significant issue in user-facing applications.
  We develop a very simple solution based on one permutation hashing.
Conceptually, given a massive binary data matrix, we permute the columns only
once and divide the permuted columns evenly into k bins; and we simply store,
for each data vector, the smallest nonzero location in each bin. The
interesting probability analysis (which is validated by experiments) reveals
that our one permutation scheme should perform very similarly to the original
(k-permutation) minwise hashing. In fact, the one permutation scheme can be
even slightly more accurate, due to the ""sample-without-replacement"" effect.
  Our experiments with training linear SVM and logistic regression on the
webspam dataset demonstrate that this one permutation hashing scheme can
achieve the same (or even slightly better) accuracies compared to the original
k-permutation scheme. To test the robustness of our method, we also experiment
with the small news20 dataset which is very sparse and has merely on average
500 nonzeros in each data vector. Interestingly, our one permutation scheme
noticeably outperforms the k-permutation scheme when k is not too small on the
news20 dataset. In summary, our method can achieve at least the same accuracy
as the original k-permutation scheme, at merely 1/k of the original
preprocessing cost.

total energy conservation. We propose that the velocity can be expanded in
terms of their relative distance and produce a better fit to the available

calculate under which conditions an (unstable) equilibrium state can be reached
