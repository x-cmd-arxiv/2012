LHC. These processes will help to validate the Standard Model at highest
energies, and they may also open the door for the discovery of new physics
potentially showing up in subtle modifications of the non-abelian structure of
weak interactions. In this letter, we present the first full
$\mathcal{O}(\alpha^3)$ analysis of on-shell W$^\pm$Z and Z-pair production at
the LHC with all mass effects consistently included. The resulting electroweak
corrections are negative, strongly increase with increasing transverse momenta,
and lead to significant modifications of rapidity and angular distributions. In
view of the high energies accessible at the LHC, combined with considerable
event rates, our results have to be included in a proper analysis of
experimental data.

interaction region design. A specially-designed symmetric Chromaticity
Compensation Block (CCB) induces an angle spread in the passing beam such that
it cancels the chromatic kick of the final focusing quadrupoles. Two such CCBs
placed symmetrically around an interaction point allow simultaneous
compensation of the 1st-order chromaticities and chromatic beam smear at the IP
without inducing significant 2nd-order aberrations to the particle trajectory.
We first develop an analytic description of this approach and explicitly
formulate 2nd-order aberration compensation conditions at the interaction
point. The concept is next applied to develop an interaction region design for
the ion collider ring of an electron-ion collider. We numerically evaluate
performance of the design in terms of momentum acceptance and dynamic aperture.
The advantages of the new concept are illustrated by comparing it to the
conventional distributed-sextupole chromaticity compensation scheme.

understanding genome biology. Researchers must explore many large datasets of
genome intervals (e.g., genes, sequence alignments) to place their experimental
results in a broader context and to make new discoveries. Relationships between
genomic datasets are typically measured by identifying intervals that
intersect: that is, they overlap and thus share a common genome interval. Given
the continued advances in DNA sequencing technologies, efficient methods for
measuring statistically significant relationships between many sets of genomic
features is crucial for future discovery.
  Results: We introduce the Binary Interval Search (BITS) algorithm, a novel
and scalable approach to interval set intersection. We demonstrate that BITS
outperforms existing methods at counting interval intersections. Moreover, we
show that BITS is intrinsically suited to parallel computing architectures such

because of finite-size effects and stray external fields.
  Technical developments, including laser heating and the use of long Josephson
tunnel junctions, have improved the quality of data that can be obtained. With
new experiments in mind we perform large-scale 3D simulations of quenches of
small, thin rings of various geometries with fully dynamical electromagnetic

Cherenkov detectors, particularly those that involve separating
extraterrestrial neutrinos from the atmospheric neutrino background. Muon
energy has traditionally been determined by measuring the specific energy loss
(dE/dx) along the muon's path and relating the dE/dx to the muon energy.
Because high-energy muons (E_mu > 1 TeV) lose energy randomly, the spread in
dE/dx values is quite large, leading to a typical energy resolution of 0.29 in
log10(E_mu) for a muon observed over a 1 km path length in the IceCube
detector. In this paper, we present an improved method that uses a truncated
mean and other techniques to determine the muon energy. The muon track is
divided into separate segments with individual dE/dx values. The elimination of
segments with the highest dE/dx results in an overall dE/dx that is more
closely correlated to the muon energy. This method results in an energy
resolution of 0.22 in log10(E_mu), which gives a 26% improvement. This
technique is applicable to any large water or ice detector and potentially to
large scintillator or liquid argon detectors.

T_{max} ~ 4.8 K) data show both the gradual disappearance of the prominence due
to vertical drainage and lateral transport of plasma followed by the formation
of a new prominence some 12 hours later. The formation of the prominence is
preceded by the appearance of a bright emission ""cloud"" in the central region
of the coronal cavity. The peak brightness of the cloud progressively shifts in
time from the Fe XIV 211 \AA\ channel, through the Fe XII 193 \AA\ channel, to
the Fe IX 171 \AA\ channel (log T_{max} ~ 6.2, 6.1, 5.8 K, respectively) while
simultaneously decreasing in altitude. Filter ratio analysis estimates the
initial temperature of the cloud in the cavity to be approximately log T \sim
6.25 K with evidence of cooling over time. The subsequent growth of the
prominence is accompanied by darkening of the cavity in the 211 \AA\ channel.
The observations imply the possibility of prominence formation via in situ
condensation of hot plasma from the coronal cavity, in support of the proposed
process of magneto-thermal convection in coronal magnetic flux ropes.

LaFe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$AsO ($T_c \simeq 9.1$ K) under high magnetic fields. In
contrast to most of the previously reported Fe based superconductors, and
despite its relatively low $T_c$, LaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$AsO shows a superconducting
anisotropy which is comparable to those seen for instance in the cuprates or
$\gamma_H = H_{c2}^{ab}/H_{c2}^{c} = m_c/m_{ab} \simeq 9$, where $m_c/m_{ab}$
is the effective mass anisotropy. Although, in the present case and as in all
Fe based superconductors, $\gamma \rightarrow 1$ as $T \rightarrow 0$. Under
the application of an external field, we also observe a remarkable broadening
of the superconducting transition particularly for fields applied along the
inter-planar direction. Both observations indicate that the low dimensionality
of LaFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$AsO is likely to lead to a more complex vortex
phase-diagram when compared to the other Fe arsenides and consequently, to a
pronounced dissipation associated with the movement of vortices in a possible
vortex liquid phase. When compared to, for instance, F-doped compounds
pertaining to same family, we obtain rather small activation energies for the
motion of vortices. This suggests that the disorder introduced by doping
LaFeAsO with F is more effective in pinning the vortices than alloying it with
Co.

properties and to measure its couplings to fermions and gauge bosons with the
highest possible accuracy. However, the measurements will be limited by
significant theoretical uncertainties that affect the production cross section
in the main production channels as well as by experimental systematical errors.
Following earlier work, we propose in this paper to consider ratios of Higgs
production cross sections times decay branching ratios in which most of the
theoretical uncertainties and some systematical errors, such as the ones due to
the luminosity measurement and the Higgs decay branching fractions, cancel out.
The couplings of the Higgs particle could be then probed in a way that will be
mostly limited by the statistical accuracy achievable at the LHC and accuracies
at the percent level are foreseen for some of the ratios at the end of the LHC
run. At the theoretical level, these ratios are also interesting as they do not
involve the ambiguities that affect the Higgs total decay width in new physics
scenarios. To illustrate how these ratios can be used to determine the Higgs
couplings, we perform a rough analysis of the recent ATLAS and CMS data which
shows that there is presently no significant deviation from the Standard Model
expectation.

apparent violation of the equivalence principle and the postulates of black
hole complementarity. In this paper I review the arguments for firewalls, and
give a slightly different interpretation of them. According to this
interpretation the horizon has standard properties, but the singularity is
non-standard. The growing entanglement of the black hole with Hawking radiation
causes the singularity to migrate toward the horizon, and eventually intersect
it at the page time. The resulting collision of the singularity with the
horizon leads to the firewall. Complementarity applies to the horizon and not
to the singular firewall.
  Almheiri, Marolf, Polchinski, and Sully conjecture that firewalls form much
earlier then the Page time; namely at the scrambling time. I argue that there
is no reason to believe this generalization, and good reason to think it is
wrong.
  For most of this paper I will assume that the firewall argument is correct.
In the last section before the conclusion I will describe reasons for having
reservations.

great promise as the building blocks of novel electronic devices. However,
these properties are strongly dependent on the geometry of the edges of the
graphene devices. Thus far only zigzag and armchair edges have been extensively
studied. However, several other self passivating edge reconstructions are
possible, and were experimentally observed. Here we utilize the Nonequilibrium
Green's Function (NEGF) technique in conjunction with tight binding methods to
model quantum transport through armchair, zigzag, and several other
self-passivated edge reconstructions. In addition we consider the
experimentally relevant cases of mixed edges, where random combinations of
possible terminations exist on a given GNR boundary. We find that transport
through GNR's with self-passivating edge reconstructions is governed by the
sublattice structure of the edges, in a manner similar to their parent zigzag
or armchair configurations. Furthermore, we find that the reconstructed
armchair GNR's have a larger band gap energy than pristine armchair edges and
are more robust against edge disorder. These results offer novel insights into
the transport in GNRs with realistic edges and are thus of paramount importance
in the development of GNR based devices.

theoretically how inelastic tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) can shed light on
these issues. We present calculations of the geometries, low bias conductances
and IETS of propanedithiol and propanedithiolate molecular junctions with gold
electrodes. We show that IETS can distinguish between junctions with molecules
having no, one or two thiol hydrogen atoms. We find that in most cases the
single-molecule junctions in the IETS experiment of Hihath et al. [Nano Lett.
8, 1673 (2008)] had no thiol H atoms, but that a molecule with a single thiol H
atom may have bridged their junction occasionally. We also consider the
evolution of the IETS spectrum as a gold STM tip approaches the intact S-H
group at the end of a molecule bound at its other end to a second electrode. We
predict the frequency of a vibrational mode of the thiol H atom to increase by
a factor \sim 2 as the gap between the tip and molecule narrows. Therefore,
IETS should be able to track the approach of the tip towards the thiol group of
the molecule and detect the detachment of the thiol H atom from the molecule

observations of broad-lined Type Ic SN 2007bg. The light curve shows three
distinct phases of spectral and temporal evolution, implying that the SNe shock
likely encountered at least 3 different circumstellar medium regimes. We
interpret this as the progenitor of SN 2007bg having at least two distinct
mass-loss episodes (i.e., phases 1 and 3) during its final stages of evolution,
yielding a highly-stratified circumstellar medium. Modelling the phase 1 light
curve as a freely-expanding, synchrotron-emitting shell, self-absorbed by its
own radiating electrons, requires a progenitor mass-loss rate of
\dot{M}~1.9x10^{-6}(v_{w}/1000 km s^{-1}) Solar masses per year for the last
t~20(v_{w}/1000 km s^{-1}) yr before explosion, and a total energy of the radio
emitting ejecta of E\sim1x10^{48} erg after 10 days from explosion. This places
SN 2007bg among the most energetic Type Ib/c events. We interpret the second
phase as a sparser ""gap"" region between the two winds stages. Phase 3 shows a
second absorption turn-on before rising to a peak luminosity 2.6 times higher
than in phase 1. Assuming this luminosity jump is due to a circumstellar medium
density enhancement from a faster previous mass-loss episode, we estimate that
the phase 3 mass-loss rate could be as high as \dot{M}<~4.3x10^{-4}(v_{w}/1000
km s^{-1}) Solar masses per year. The phase 3 wind would have transitioned
directly into the phase 1 wind for a wind speed difference of ~2. In summary,
the radio light curve provides robust evidence for dramatic global changes in
at least some Ic-BL progenitors just prior (~10-1000 yr) to explosion. The
observed luminosity of this SN is the highest observed for a
non-gamma-ray-burst broad-lined Type Ic SN, reaching L_{8.46 GHz}~1x10^{29} erg
Hz^{-1} s^{-1}, ~567 days after explosion.

are developed, reproducing well the experimental information in the energy
region 5 GeV - 7 TeV. The parametrization for the total cross sections is then
extended to fit the elastic (integrated) cross section data in the same energy
region, with satisfactory results. From these empirical results we extract the
energy dependence of several physical quantities: inelastic cross section,
ratios elastic/total, inelastic/total cross sections, ratio
total-cross-section/elastic-slope, elastic slope and optical point. All data,

indirect territorial battle to the spontaneous emergence and destruction of

fascinatingly reach social dynamics that explains why this costly behavior has
evolved and persevered. Comparisons with adaptive punishment, however, uncover
an Achilles heel of adaptive rewarding that is due to over-aggression, which in

focal plane wavefront control techniques to achieve the necessary contrast
levels. These correction algorithms are iterative and the control methods
require an estimate of the electric field at the science camera, which requires
nearly all of the images taken for the correction. We demonstrate a Kalman
filter estimator that uses prior knowledge to create the estimate of the
electric field, dramatically reducing the number of exposures required to
estimate the image plane electric field. In addition to a significant reduction
in exposures, we discuss the relative merit of this algorithm to other
estimation schemes, particularly in regard to estimate error and covariance. As
part of the reduction in exposures we also discuss a novel approach to
generating the diversity required for estimating the field in the image plane.
This uses the stroke minimization control algorithm to choose the probe shapes
on the deformable mirrors, adding a degree of optimality to the problem and
once again reducing the total number of exposures required for correction.
Choosing probe shapes has been largely unexplored up to this point and is
critical to producing a well posed set of measurements for the estimate.
Ultimately the filter will lead to an adaptive algorithm which can estimate
physical parameters in the laboratory and optimize estimation.

form the building blocks which merge hierarchically to more massive galaxies.
Since intergalactic gas is accreted by massive galaxies, observable e.g. as
high- velocity clouds (HVCs) around the Milky Way, with extremely low
metallicities, these can be suggested to represent the baryonic content of
primordial Dark Matter (DM) subhalos. Another possibility of their origin is
that they stem from disrupted satellite galaxies, but in this case, these gas
clouds move unaccompanied by a bound DM structure. Since HVCs are observed with
long gas tails and with irregular substructures, numerical models are performed
aiming at exploring their structure and compare them with observations. If HVCs
are engulfed by DM subhalos, their gas must leave the DM gravitational
potential and reflect this in their dynamics. On the other hand, the evolution
and survival of pure gas models must be tested to distinguish between
DM-dominated and DM-free clouds and to allow conclusions on their origin. The
models demonstrate that purely baryonic HVCs with low masses are disrupted by
ram-pressure stripping and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, while more massive
ones survive, losing their initially spherical shape and develop significant
substructures including cometary elongations in the column density distribution
(""head-tail structure""). On the contrary, HVCs with DM subhalos survive with
more than 90% of their gas mass still bound and spherically shaped, approaching
the Galactic disk like bullets. In addition, we find that velocity gradients
along the cometary head-tail structures does not necessarily offer a
possibility to distinguish between DM-dominated and purely gaseous HVCs.
Comparison of models with observations let us conclude that HVCs are not
embedded in a DM substructure and do not trace the cosmological subhalo
population.

of the galaxies at rest-frame optical wavelengths, fitting two-dimensional
axi-symmetric Sersic models. Crucially, the WFC3/IR H-band imaging enables
modelling of the mass-dominant galaxy, rather than the blue high-surface
brightness features which often dominate optical (rest-frame UV) images of
(sub-)mm galaxies, and can confuse visual morphological classification. As a
result of this analysis we find that >95% of the rest-frame optical light in
almost all of the (sub-)mm galaxies is well-described by either a single
exponential disk, or a multiple-component system in which the dominant
constituent is disk-like. We demonstrate that this conclusion is consistent
with the results of high-quality ground-based K-band imaging, and explain why.
The massive disk galaxies which host luminous (sub-)mm emission are reasonably
extended (r_e=4 kpc), consistent with the sizes of other massive star-forming
disks at z~2. In many cases we find evidence of blue clumps within the sources,
with the mass-dominant disk becoming more significant at longer wavelengths.
Finally, only a minority of the sources show evidence for a major galaxy-galaxy
interaction. Taken together, these results support the view that most (sub-)mm
galaxies at z~2 are simply the most extreme examples of normal star-forming
galaxies at that era.

does not reverberate, and the velocity characteristics of this component vary
from object-to-object. The differing strength and properties of this
non-variable component are responsible for much of the scatter in CIV-based
black hole masses compared to Hbeta masses. The CIV mass bias introduced by
this non-variable component is correlated with the shape of the CIV line,
allowing us to make an empirical correction to the black hole mass estimates.
Using this correction and accounting for other sources of scatter such as poor
data quality and data inhomogeneity reduces the scatter between the CIV and
Hbeta masses in our sample by a factor of ~2, to only ~0.2 dex. We discuss the
possibility that this non-variable CIV component originates in an
orientation-dependent outflow from either the proposed broad line region (BLR)

in double layer graphene heterostructures (DLGs) on transport characteristics
of DLG devices in the metallic regime. The effect of gate-tunable charge
density in the additional layer is two-fold: it provides screening of the
long-range potential of charged defects in the system, and screens out Coulomb
interactions between charge carriers. We find that the efficiency of defect
charge screening is strongly dependent on the concentration and location of
defects within the DLG. In particular, only a moderate suppression of
electron-hole puddles around the Dirac point induced by the high concentration
of remote impurities in the silicon oxide substrate could be achieved. A
stronger effect is found on the elastic relaxation rate due to charged defects
resulting in mobility strongly dependent on the electron denisty in the
additional layer of DLG. We find that the quantum interference correction to
the resistivity of graphene is also strongly affected by screening in DLG. In
particular, the dephasing rate is strongly suppressed by the additional
screening that supresses the amplitude of electron-electron interaction and
reduces the diffusion time that electrons spend in proximity of each other. The
latter effect combined with screening of elastic relaxation rates results in a
peculiar gate tunable weak-localization magnetoresistance and quantum
correction to resistivity. We propose suitable experiments to test our theory
and discuss the possible relevance of our results to exisiting data.

expressed in terms of fully renormalized amplitudes for these processes. The
overall prefactor of the T^D term vanishes in the ""local approximation"", when
the interaction can be approximated by its value for the initial and final
fermionic states right on the Fermi surface. The local approximation is
justified near a Pomeranchuk instability, even if the vertex corrections are
non-negligible. We show that the strength of the first-Matsubara-frequency rule
is amplified in the local approximation, where it states that not only the T^D
term vanishes but also that \Sigma^R(i\pi T,T) does not contain any terms
beyond O(T). This rule imposes two constraints on the scaling form of the
self-energy: upon replacing \omega by i\pi T, Im\Sigma^R(\omega,T) must vanish
and Re\Sigma^R (\omega, T) must reduce to O(T). These two constraints should be
taken into consideration in extracting scaling forms of \Sigma^R(\omega,T) from
experimental and numerical data.

Fermi liquid form Re\sigma^{-1}(\Omega,T)\propto \Omega^2+4\pi^2T^2 holds under
very general conditions, namely in any dimensionality above one, for a Fermi
surface of an arbitrary shape (but away from nesting and van Hove

show that the scaling form of Re\sigma^{-1}(\Omega,T) is determined by the
analytic properties of the conductivity along the Matsubara axis. If a system
contains not only itinerant electrons but also localized degrees of freedom
which scatter electrons elastically, e.g., magnetic moments or resonant levels,
the scaling form changes to Re\sigma^{-1}(\Omega,T)\propto \Omega^2+b\pi^2T^2,
with 1\leq b<\infty. For purely elastic scattering, b =1. Our analysis implies
that the value of b\approx 1, reported for URu_2Si_2 and some rare-earth based

Simulations"" (KS) have been criticized by Thomson & Devenish (TD) (2005), who
argued that sweeping decorrelation effects suppress pair dispersion in such
models. We derive analytical results for Eulerian turbulence modeled by
Gaussian random fields for the case with zero mean velocity. Our starting point
is an exact integrodifferential equation for the particle pair separation
distribution. When memory times of particle locations are short, a Markovian
approximation leads to a Richardson-type diffusion model. We obtain a
diffusivity tensor of the form $K_{ij}(r,t)=S_{ij}(r)\tau(r,t)$ where
$S_{ij}(r)$ is the structure-function tensor and $\tau(r,t)$ is an effective
correlation time of velocity increments. This is found to be the minimum value
of three times: the intrinsic turnover time $\tau_{eddy}(r)$ at separation $r$,
the overall evolution time $t,$ and the sweeping time $r/v_0$ with $v_0$ the
rms velocity. We study the diffusion model numerically by a Monte Carlo method.
With moderate inertial-ranges like those achieved in current KS, our model is
found to reproduce the $t^{9/2}$ power-law for pair dispersion predicted by TD
and observed in the KS. However, for much longer ranges, our model exhibits
three distinct pair-dispersion laws in the inertial-range: a Batchelor
$t^2$-regime, followed by a $t^1$ diffusive regime, and then a $t^6$ regime.
Finally, outside the inertial-range, there is another $t^1$ regime with
particles undergoing independent Taylor diffusion. These scalings are exactly
the same as those predicted by TD for KS with large mean velocities, which we
argue hold also for KS with zero mean velocity. Our results support the basic
conclusion that sweeping effects make Lagrangian properties of KS fundamentally
different from hydrodynamic turbulence for very extended inertial-ranges.

from the Wide Field Spectrograph on the ANU 2.3 m telescope to analyse spectra

shock velocities, densities, radiative ages and pressures across the object. We
show that S26 is just entering its radiative phase, and that the northern and
western regions are dominated by partially-radiative shocks due to a lower
density ISM in these directions. We determine a velocity of expansion along the
jet of 330 km s$^{-1}$, and a velocity of expansion of the bubble in the minor
axis direction of 132 km s$^{-1}$. We determine the age of the structure to be
$4.1\times10^5$ yr, and the jet energy flux to be $ (4-10)\times10^{40}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ The jet appears to be collimated within $\sim0.25$ deg, and to undergo
very little precession. If the relativistic $\beta \sim 1/3$, then some 4

this paper we introduce rotations for finite posets, which can be seen as the
poset counterpart of Seidel-switch for finite graphs. We analyze some of their

two finite posets are rotation-equivalent. We moreover give an explicit

of first-principles calculations and experimental parameters of the crystal
structure. Then, we solve this model in the Hartree-Fock approximation. We
argue that the multiferroic state in YMnO3 has a magnetic origin, and the
centrosymmetric Pbnm structure is formally sufficient for explaining details of
the noncentrosymmetric magnetic ground state. The relativistic spin-orbit
interaction lifts the degeneracy, caused by the frustration of isotropic
interactions, and stabilizes a twofold periodic magnetic state, which is
similar to the E-state apart from the spin canting. The noncentrosymmetric
atomic displacements in the P2_1nm phase reduce the spin canting, but do not
change the symmetry of the magnetic state. The effect of the P2_1nm distortion
on the FE polarization P_a is twofold: (i) it gives rise to ionic
contributions, associated with the Y and O sites; (ii) it affects the
electronic polarization, through the change of the spin canting. The relatively
small value of P_a, observed in the experiment, is caused by a partial
cancelation of the electronic and ionic contributions in the experimental
P2_1nm structure. Finally, we theoretically optimize the crystal structure, by
using the LSDA+U approach and assuming the collinear E-type alignment. We have
found that the agreement with the experimental data in this case is less
satisfactory and P_a is largely overestimated. Although the magnetic structure
can be formally tuned by varying the Coulomb repulsion U as a parameter,
apparently LSDA+U fails to reproduce some fine details of the experimental
structure, and the cancelation of different contributions in P_a does not
occur.

distribution of galaxy properties on the MP is characterized by: (i) a zone of
exclusion described by two power-laws joined by a break at M 3e10 Msun. This
results in a break in the mean M-sigma relation with Msigma^2.3 and M sigma^4.7
at small and large sigma respectively; (ii) a mass M 2e11 Msun which separates
a population dominated by flat fast rotator with disks and spiral galaxies at
lower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses;
(iii) below that mass the distribution of ETGs properties tends to be constant
along lines of constant sigma; (iv) it forms a parallel sequence with the

fast rotator ETGs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf ETGs

sigma traces the bulge fraction, which drives the observed trends in M/L,
Hbeta, colour, IMF and molecular gas fraction. We interpret this as due to a
combination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction which
increases sigma and greatly enhances the likelihood for a galaxy to have its
star formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass along

power-law distributions. The accurate identification of power-law patterns has
significant consequences for correctly understanding and modeling complex
systems. However, statistical evidence for or against the power-law hypothesis
is complicated by large fluctuations in the empirical distribution's tail, and
these are worsened when information is lost from binning the data. We adapt the
statistically principled framework for testing the power-law hypothesis,
developed by Clauset, Shalizi and Newman, to the case of binned data. This
approach includes maximum-likelihood fitting, a hypothesis test based on the
Kolmogorov--Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistic and likelihood ratio tests for
comparing against alternative explanations. We evaluate the effectiveness of
these methods on synthetic binned data with known structure, quantify the loss
of statistical power due to binning, and apply the methods to twelve real-world
binned data sets with heavy-tailed patterns.

influential in shaping our understanding of early galaxy formation and the role
galaxies may play in cosmic reionization. Of particular importance is the
stellar mass density at early times which represents the integral of earlier
star formation. An important puzzle arising from the measurements so far
reported is that the specific star formation rates (sSFR) evolve far less
rapidly than expected in most theoretical models. Yet the observations
underpinning these results remain very uncertain, owing in part to the possible
contamination of rest-optical broadband light from strong nebular emission
lines. To quantify the contribution of nebular emission to broad-band fluxes,
we investigate the SEDs of 92 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies in the
redshift range 3.8<z<5.0 chosen because the H-alpha line lies within the
Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 um filter. We demonstrate that the 3.6 um flux is
systematically in excess of that expected from stellar continuum, which we
derive by fitting the SED with population synthesis models. No such excess is
seen in a control sample at 3.1<z<3.6 in which there is no nebular
contamination in the IRAC filters. From the distribution of our 3.6 um flux
excesses, we derive an H-alpha equivalent width (EW) distribution. The mean
rest-frame H-alpha EW we infer at 3.8<z<5.0 (270 A) indicates that nebular
emission contributes at least 30% of the 3.6 um flux. Via our
empirically-derived EW distribution we correct the available stellar mass
densities and show that the sSFR evolves more rapidly at z>4 than previously
thought, supporting up to a 5x increase between z~2 and 7. Such a trend is much
closer to theoretical expectations. Given our findings, we discuss the
prospects for verifying quantitatively the nebular emission line strengths
prior to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.

text from the OCR provides a wealth of data and opinion for researchers and
historians. However, categorization of articles provided by the OCR engine is
rudimentary and a large number of the articles are labeled editorial without
further grouping. Manually sorting articles into fine-grained categories is
time consuming if not impossible given the size of the corpus. This paper
studies techniques for automatic categorization of newspaper articles so as to
enhance search and retrieval on the archive. We explore unsupervised (e.g.
KMeans) and semi-supervised (e.g. constrained clustering) learning algorithms
to develop article categorization schemes geared towards the needs of
end-users. A pilot study was designed to understand whether there was unanimous
agreement amongst patrons regarding how articles can be categorized. It was
found that the task was very subjective and consequently automated algorithms
that could deal with subjective labels were used. While the small scale pilot
study was extremely helpful in designing machine learning algorithms, a much
larger system needs to be developed to collect annotations from users of the
archive. The ""BODHI"" system currently being developed is a step in that
direction, allowing users to correct wrongly scanned OCR and providing keywords

of the beta version of this system, we hope that it can be integrated with

filtration and an ascending filtration and a $\Frob_q$-twisted isomorphism
between the respective graded sheaves. In this article we define and
systematically investigate what might be called ""$F$-zips with a
$G$-structure"", for an arbitrary reductive linear algebraic group $G$.
  These objects come in two incarnations. One incarnation is an exact linear
tensor functor from the category of finite dimensional representations of $G$
to the category of $F$-zips over $S$. Locally any such functor has a type
$\chi$, which is a cocharacter of $G$. The other incarnation is a certain
$G$-torsor analogue of the notion of $F$-zips. We prove that both incarnations
define stacks that are naturally equivalent to a quotient stack of the form
$[E_{G,\chi}\backslash G_k]$ that was studied in an earlier paper. By the
results obtained there they are therefore smooth algebraic stacks of dimension
0 over $k$. Using our earlier results we can also classify the isomorphism
classes of such objects over an algebraically closed field, describe their
automorphism groups, and determine which isomorphism classes can degenerate
into which others.
  For classical groups we can deduce the corresponding results for twisted or
untwisted symplectic, orthogonal, or unitary $F$-zips. The results can be
applied to the algebraic de Rham cohomology of smooth projective varieties (or
generalizations thereof such as smooth proper Deligne-Mumford stacks) and to
truncated Barsotti-Tate groups of level 1. In addition, we hope that our
systematic group theoretical approach will help to understand the analogue of
the Ekedahl-Oort stratification of the special fibers of arbitrary Shimura
varieties.

a time-dependent Hamiltonian barred galaxy model. Recently, a strong
correlation was found between the strength of the bar and the presence of
chaotic motion in this system, as models with relatively strong bars were shown
to exhibit stronger chaotic behavior compared to those having a weaker bar
component. Here, we attempt to further explore this connection by studying the
interplay between chaotic and regular behavior of star orbits when the
parameters of the model evolve in time. This happens for example when one
introduces linear time dependence in the mass parameters of the model to mimic,
in some general sense, the effect of self-consistent interactions of the actual
N-body problem. We thus observe, in this simple time-dependent model also, that
the increase of the bar's mass leads to an increase of the system's chaoticity.
We propose a new way of using the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method as
a reliable criterion to estimate the relative fraction of chaotic vs. regular
orbits in such time-dependent potentials, which proves to be much more
efficient than the computation of Lyapunov exponents. In particular, GALI is
able to capture subtle changes in the nature of an orbit (or ensemble of
orbits) even for relatively small time intervals, which makes it ideal for
detecting dynamical transitions in time-dependent systems.

propose efficient procedures for learning a sparse Ising model based on a
penalized composite conditional likelihood with nonconcave penalties.
Nonconcave penalized likelihood estimation has received a lot of attention in
recent years. However, such an approach is computationally prohibitive under
high-dimensional Ising models. To overcome such difficulties, we extend the
methodology and theory of nonconcave penalized likelihood to penalized
composite conditional likelihood estimation. The proposed method can be
efficiently implemented by taking advantage of coordinate-ascent and
minorization--maximization principles. Asymptotic oracle properties of the
proposed method are established with NP-dimensionality. Optimality of the
computed local solution is discussed. We demonstrate its finite sample
performance via simulation studies and further illustrate our proposal by
studying the Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 protease structure based on
data from the Stanford HIV drug resistance database. Our statistical learning
results match the known biological findings very well, although no prior
biological information is used in the data analysis procedure.

radiation suggested by observations, while the modulus decay through the

In the sequestered case, the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by the
modulus decay can naturally account for the observed dark matter density. In

not produced by the modulus decay, since the soft masses are of order the heavy

error which depends on signal to noise ratio of background image. We find that
the origin of the error is the random count noise which comes from Poisson
noise of sky counts. Random count noise makes additional moments and centroid
shift error, and those 1st orders are canceled in averaging, but 2nd orders are
not canceled. We derived the equations which corrects these effects in
measuring moments and ellipticity of the image and test their validity using

degree. We prove a lemma showing that one can strengthen Mader's result by
replacing the notion of high connectivity by the notion of vertex expansion.
  Another well known result in graph theory states that for every integer t
there is a smallest real c(t) so that every n-vertex graph with c(t)n edges
contains a K_t-minor. Fiorini, Joret, Theis and Wood conjectured that if an
n-vertex graph G has (c(t)+\epsilon)n edges then G contains a K_t-minor of
order at most C(\epsilon)log n. We use our extension of Mader's theorem to
prove that such a graph G must contain a K_t-minor of order at most
C(\epsilon)log n loglog n. Known constructions of graphs with high girth show
that this result is tight up to the loglog n factor.

to access time-sensitive data anytime anywhere has fuelled a high demand for
wireless networks. However, wireless networks are susceptible to intrusion and
security problems. There is an inherent need to secure the wireless data
communication to ensure the confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non

the resultant energy consumption to achieve sufficient security can be high.
Encryption algorithms are generally computationally intensive, and consume a
significant amount of computing resources (such as CPU time, memory, and
battery power). Considering the limited resources on wireless devices, it is
crucial that security protocols be implemented efficiently. This manuscript
focuses on how energy consumption is impacted by the use of unoptimised
AES-CCMP algorithms and proposes an optimized AES CCMP algorithm using 2-way
interleaving that does not compromise the security of wireless communication
sessions. There is also analysis of the performance of AES (a.k.a. Rijndael) in
its AES-CCMP implementation. The 2-way interleaving technique is an
optimization of the CBC-MAC that is investigated using two performance metrics
(namely encryption time and throughput).

scalar curvature of S^2xSigma does not vanish, the vortex equations are well

discontinuities at the boundaries, as well as effects from ion confinement in
the slit region between the surfaces are taken fully into account, leading to
image-generated depletion attraction, ion correlation attraction and
steric-like repulsive interactions. We investigate these effects by employing a

The latter incorporates strong ion-image charge correlations, which develop in
the presence of high valency ions in the mixture. We show that the implicit-ion
simulations and the proposed analytical theory can describe the explicit
simulation results on a qualitative level, while excellent quantitative
agreement can be obtained for sufficiently large monovalent salt
concentrations. The resultant attractive interaction between the neutral

interactions between semi-infinite dielectrics, and can thus play a significant
role at the nano scale.

into account of the fluctuations around each time point to distinguish between

Snapshots with similar fluctuations are used as nodes of a transition network,
the clusterization of which into states provides accurate Markov-State-Models

binary systems for circumbinary companions. An intriguing tertiary signal has
been discovered in the short period eclipsing binary KIC002856960. This third
body leads to transit-like features in the light curve occurring every 204.2
days, while the two other components of the system display eclipses on a 6.2
hour period. The variations due to the tertiary body last for a duration of
\sim1.26 days, or 4.9 binary orbital periods. During each crossing of the
binary orbit with the tertiary body, multiple individual transits are observed
as the close binary stars repeatedly move in and out of alignment with the
tertiary object. We are at this stage unable to distinguish between a planetary
companion to a close eclipsing binary, or a hierarchical triply eclipsing
system of three stars. Both possibilities are explored, and the light curves
presented.

Moreover, the behavior of percolation probability $R_L(p)$ that a lattice of

symmetry for F(R) theory of gravity coupled to a tachyon field enforces gauge
to vanish and leads to F(R) \propto R^2, with a tachyon potential V(\phi)
\propto \phi^{-4}. Here, we show that the analysis is completely wrong since
the conserved current does not satisfy the field equations. Earlier, it has
been shown that F(R) theory of gravity in vacuum or in matter dominated era
admits trivial Noether symmetry for F(R) \propto R^{3/2}, because z = a^2, a
being the scale factor, becomes cyclic for F(R) \propto R^{3/2}. Further, it
has already been noticed that F(R) does not admit Noether symmetry when coupled
to a scalar sector, minimally or non-minimally. Finally, here we show that
Noether symmetry is obscure even when F(R) is coupled to a tachyon field.
However, Noether symmetry for R^2 gravity coupled to a scalar taking an
auxiliary variable Q different from R exists in the literature and it is not
recovered from F(R) gravity. Since, canonization of a general F(R) theory of
gravity is only possible treating R as the auxiliary variable, so we conclude
that in general Noether symmetry of F(R) theory of gravity is obscure.

Allopolyploid species are formed after hybridization between otherwise

successful implementation of species tree models that take population genetic
parameters into account. However, these models have not included allopolyploid
hybridization and the special problems imposed when species trees of
allopolyploids are inferred. Here, two new models for the statistical inference
of the evolutionary history of allopolyploids are evaluated using simulations
and demonstrated on two empirical data sets. It is assumed that there has been
a single hybridization event between two diploid species resulting in a genomic
allotetraploid. The evolutionary history can be represented as a network or as
a multiply labeled tree, in which some pairs of tips are labeled with the same
species. In one of the models (AlloppMUL), the multiply labeled tree is
inferred directly. This is the simplest model and the most widely applicable,
since fewer assumptions are made. The second model (AlloppNET) incorporates the
hybridization event explicitly which means that fewer parameters need to be
estimated. Both models are implemented in the BEAST framework. Simulations show
that both models are useful and that AlloppNET is more accurate if the
assumptions it is based on are valid. The models are demonstrated on previously
analyzed data from the genus Pachycladon (Brassicaceae) and from the genus

exert strong control on the thermal conductivity of these systems. For stripe
superlattices, we find that zigzag configured interfaces produce a higher
$\kappa$ in the direction parallel to the interface than the armchair

details of the interface and is limited by the $\kappa$ of h-BN. Additionally,
the embedded dot structures, having mixed zigzag and armchair interfaces,
affects the thermal transport properties more strongly than superlattices.

depend whether constant voltage or constant current is applied to the single

down to metallic values and relaxes subsequently in a single-exponential manner

via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Planck is able, for the first time, to detect
SZ emission up to r ~ 3 X R_500. We test previously proposed models for the
pressure distribution in clusters against the azimuthally averaged data. We
find that the Arnaud et al. universal pressure profile does not fit Coma, and
that their pressure profile for merging systems provides a good fit of the data
only at r<R_500: by r=2XR_500 it underestimates the observed y profile by a
factor of ~2. This may indicate that at these larger radii either i) the
cluster SZ emission is contaminated by unresolved SZ sources along the line of
sight or ii) the pressure profile of Coma is higher at r>R_500 than the mean
pressure profile predicted by the simulations. The Planck image shows
significant local steepening of the y profile in two regions about half a
degree to the west and to the south-east of the cluster centre. These features
are consistent with the presence of shock fronts at these radii, and indeed the
western feature was previously noticed in the ROSAT PSPC mosaic as well as in
the radio. Using Planck y profiles extracted from corresponding sectors we find
pressure jumps of 4.5+0.4-0.2 and 5.0+1.3-0.1 in the west and southeast,
respectively. Assuming Rankine-Hugoniot pressure jump conditions, we deduce
that the shock waves should propagate with Mach number M_w=2.03+0.09-0.04 and
M_se=2.05+0.25-0.02 in the West and Southeast, respectively. Finally, we find
that the y and radio-synchrotron signals are quasi-linearly correlated on Mpc
scales with small intrinsic scatter. This implies either that the energy
density of cosmic-ray electrons is relatively constant throughout the cluster,
or that the magnetic fields fall off much more slowly with radius than
previously thought.

the effect of stretching forces. Using self-avoiding walks of up to $N = 25600$
steps on the square and simple cubic lattices, variable chain stiffness is
modeled by introducing an energy penalty $\epsilon_b$ for chain bending;
varying $q_b=\exp (- \epsilon_b/k_BT)$ from $q_b=1$ (completely flexible
chains) to $q_b = 0.005$, the persistence length can be varied over two orders
of magnitude. For unstretched semiflexible chains we test the applicability of
the Kratky-Porod worm-like chain model to describe the scattering function, and
discuss methods for extracting persistence length estimates from scattering.
While in $d=2$ the direct crossover from rod-like chains to self-avoiding walks
invalidates the Kratky-Porod description, it holds in $d=3$ for stiff chains if
the number of Kuhn segments $n_K$ does not exceed a limiting value $n^*_K$
(which depends on the persistence length). For stretched chains, the Pincus
blob size enters as a further characteristic length scale. The anisotropy of
the scattering is well described by the modified Debye function, if the actual
observed chain extension $<X>$ (end-to-end distance in the direction of the
force) as well as the corresponding longitudinal and transverse linear
dimensions $<X^2> - <X>^2$, $<R_{g,\bot}^2>$ are used.

mathematical or statistical modeling of read counts or per-base exonic signal
have been successful, they may suffer from model overfitting since not all the
reference transcripts in a database are expressed under a specific biological
condition. Standard shrinkage approaches, such as Lasso, shrink all the
transcript abundances to zero in a non-discriminative manner. Thus it does not
necessarily yield the set of condition-specific transcripts. Informed shrinkage
approaches, using the observed exonic coverage signal, are thus desirable.
Motivated by ubiquitous uncovered exonic regions in RNA-Seq data, termed as
""naked exons"", we propose a new computational approach that first filters out
the reference transcripts not supported by splicing and paired-end reads, then
followed by fitting a new mathematical model of per-base exonic coverage signal
and the underlying transcripts structure. We introduce a tuning parameter to
penalize the specific regions of the selected transcripts that were not
supported by the naked exons. Our approach compares favorably with the selected
competing methods in terms of both time complexity and accuracy using simulated

non-homogeneous systems with repulsive screened Coulomb interactions,
indicating accumulation and depletion effects at the interfaces. Finally, we
consider systems with several degrees of disorder, which are prototypical for

the disturbance is stationary or traveling and whether it is caused by the
motion of atoms and molecules or the vibration of a lattice structure, a wave
can be understood as a specific type of solution of an appropriate mathematical
equation modeling the underlying physics. Typical models consist of partial
differential equations that exhibit certain general properties, e.g.,
hyperbolicity. This, in turn, leads to the possibility of wave solutions.
Various analytical techniques (integral transforms, complex variables,
reduction to ordinary differential equations, etc.) are available to find wave
solutions of linear partial differential equations. Furthermore, linear
hyperbolic equations with higher-order derivatives provide the mathematical
underpinning of the phenomenon of dispersion, i.e., the dependence of a wave's
phase speed on its wavenumber. For systems of nonlinear first-order hyperbolic
equations, there also exists a general theory for finding wave solutions. In
addition, nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations are sometimes said
to posses wave solutions, though they lack hyperbolicity, because it may be
possible to find solutions that translate in space with time. Unfortunately, an
all-encompassing methodology for solution of partial differential equations
with any possible combination of nonlinearities does not exist. Thus, nonlinear
wave solutions must be sought on a case-by-case basis depending on the

calculation of similarity measure between a pair of documents. Similarity
measure is a function that assign a real number between 0 and 1 to a pair of
documents, depending upon the degree of similarity between them. A value of
zero means that the documents are completely dissimilar whereas a value of one
indicates that the documents are practically identical. Traditionally,
vector-based models have been used for computing the document similarity. The
vector-based models represent several features present in documents. These
approaches to similarity measures, in general, cannot account for the semantics
of the document. Documents written in human languages contain contexts and the
words used to describe these contexts are generally semantically related.
Motivated by this fact, many researchers have proposed semantic-based
similarity measures by utilizing text annotation through external thesauruses
like WordNet (a lexical database). In this paper, we define a semantic
similarity measure based on documents represented in topic maps. Topic maps are
rapidly becoming an industrial standard for knowledge representation with a
focus for later search and extraction. The documents are transformed into a
topic map based coded knowledge and the similarity between a pair of documents
is represented as a correlation between the common patterns. The experimental
studies on the text mining datasets reveal that this new similarity measure is
more effective as compared to commonly used similarity measures in text
clustering.

to be a result of minimization of the interface energy due to hybridization
between Co and oxygen at the interface.

Young-Laplace equation obtaining an analogic equation and commenting some
numerical results produced by its application. The results, even if based on a
simple analogy, appear quite intriguing and very close to the experimentally
estimated or calculated values. Some conceptual and numerical limitations of
such an analogic approach are also indicated.

R+\nu T$ (proposed by R. Myrzakulov, arXiv:1205.5266v2) is considered here. For
this model we have observed a quintom-like behavior of the equation of state
(EoS) parameter and a transition from matter dominated to dark energy density
has been observed through fraction density evolution. The statefinder
parameters reveal that the model interpolates between dust and $\Lambda$CDM
phases of the universe.

Steady States (NESS) in a dissipative medium. The core device is a small
rotating blade that imposes cycles of increasing and decreasing forcings to a
granular gas, shaken independently. The velocity of this blade is measured,
subject to the transitions imposed by the periodic torque variation. The
Hatano-Sasa equality, that generalises the second principle of thermodynamics
to NESS, is verified with a high accuracy (a few $10^{-3}$), at different
variation rates. Besides, it is observed that the fluctuating velocity at fixed
forcing follows a generalised Gumbel distribution. A rough evaluation of the
mean free path in the granular gas suggests that it might be a correlated
system, at least partially.

  Grooming",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cyber-crime targeting children such as online pedophile activity are a major
and a growing concern to society. A deep understanding of predatory chat
conversations on the Internet has implications in designing effective solutions
to automatically identify malicious conversations from regular conversations.
We believe that a deeper understanding of the pedophile conversation can result
in more sophisticated and robust surveillance systems than majority of the
current systems relying only on shallow processing such as simple word-counting
or key-word spotting.
  In this paper, we study pedophile conversations from the perspective of
online grooming theory and perform a series of linguistic-based empirical
analysis on several pedophile chat conversations to gain useful insights and
patterns. We manually annotated 75 pedophile chat conversations with six stages
of online grooming and test several hypothesis on it. The results of our
experiments reveal that relationship forming is the most dominant online
grooming stage in contrast to the sexual stage. We use a widely used
word-counting program (LIWC) to create psycho-linguistic profiles for each of
the six online grooming stages to discover interesting textual patterns useful
to improve our understanding of the online pedophile phenomenon. Furthermore,
we present empirical results that throw light on various aspects of a pedophile
conversation such as probability of state transitions from one stage to
another, distribution of a pedophile chat conversation across various online
grooming stages and correlations between pre-defined word categories and online
grooming stages.
