spatial sections coupled to a massive scalar field is provided, within the
framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology. We identify solutions with their initial
data on the minimum volume section, and from this we construct the physical
Hilbert space. Moreover, a perturbative study allows us to introduce small
inhomogeneities. After gauge fixing, the inhomogeneous part of the system is
reduced to a linear field theory. We then adopt a standard Fock representation
to quantize these degrees of freedom. For the considered case of compact
spatial topology, the requirements of: i) invariance under the spatial
isometries, and ii) unitary implementation of the quantum dynamics, pick up a
unique Fock representation and a particular set of canonical fields (up to
unitary equivalence).

(computed tomography) or CBCT (cone beam computed tomography) in the KV domain
or portal imaging in the MV domain (KV: kilovolt age, MV: megavoltage).
Multiple scatter is described by, at least, one Gaussian kernel. In various
situations, this approximation is crude, and we need two/three Gaussian kernels
to account for the long-range tails (Landau tails), which appear in the
Moli\`ere scatter of protons, energy straggling and electron capture of charged
particles passing through matter and Compton scatter of photons. The ideal
image (source function) is subjected to Gaussian convolutions to yield a
blurred image recorded by a detector array. The inverse problem is to obtain
the ideal source image from measured image. Deconvolution methods of linear
combinations of two/three Gaussian kernels with different parameters s0, s1, s2
can be derived via an inhomogeneous Fredholm integral equation of second kind
(IFIE2) and Liouville - Neumann series (LNS) to provide the source function
{\rho}. The determination of scatter parameter functions s0, s1, s2 can be best
determined by Monte-Carlo simulations. A particular advantage of this procedure
is given, if the scatter functions s0, s1, s2 are not constant and depend on
coordinates. This fact implies that the scatter functions can be calibrated
according to the electron density {\rho}electron provided by image
reconstructions. The convergence criterion of LNS can always be satisfied with
regard to the above mentioned cases. A generalization of the present theory is
given by an analysis of convolution problems based on the Dirac equation and
Fermi-Dirac statistics leading to Landau tails. This generalization is applied
to Bethe-Bloch equation (BBE) of charged particles to analyze electron capture.
The methodology can readily be extended to other disciplines of physics.

To calculate the finite-temperature Green's function of the system, each lead
is simulated by a small cluster, so that the problem is reduced to that of a
finite-size system comprising the molecule and clusters on both sides. The
Hamiltonian parameters of the lead clusters are chosen such that their
embedding potentials coincide with those of the semi-infinite leads on
Matsubara frequencies. Exact diagonalization is used to evaluate the effect of
Coulomb correlations on the electronic properties of the molecule at finite
temperature. Depending on key Hamiltonian parameters, such as Coulomb
repulsion, one-electron hopping within the molecule, and hybridization between
molecule and leads, the molecular self-energy is shown to exhibit Fermi-liquid
behavior or deviations associated with finite low-energy scattering rates. The
method is shown to be sufficiently accurate to describe the formation of Kondo
resonances inside the correlation-induced pseudogaps, except in the limit of
extremely low temperatures. These results demonstrate how the system can be

of black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) imply that the variability is generated
in the 'standard' optically-thick accretion disc. The variability originates in
the disc as mass-accretion fluctuations and propagates through the disc to
'light up' inner disc regions, eventually modulating the power-law emission
that is produced relatively centrally.
  We present a comparative spectral-timing study of XMM-Newton data from the
BHXRB SWIFT J1753.5-0127 in a bright 2009 hard state with that from the
significantly fainter 2006 hard state, to show for the first time the change in
disc spectral-timing properties associated with a global increase in both the
accretion rate and the relative contribution of the disc emission to the
bolometric luminosity.
  We show that, although there is strong evidence for intrinsic disc
variability in the more luminous hard state, the disc variability amplitude is
suppressed relative to that of the power-law emission, which contrasts with the
behaviour at lower luminosities where the disc variability is slightly enhanced
when compared with the power-law variations. In the higher-luminosity data, the
disc variability below 0.6 keV becomes incoherent with the power-law and
higher-energy disc emission at frequencies below 0.5 Hz, in contrast with the
coherent variations seen in the 2006 data.
  We explain these differences and the associated complex lags in the 2009 data
in terms of the fluctuating disc model. If the variable signals are generated
at small radii in the disc, the variability of disc emission can be naturally
suppressed by the fraction of unmodulated disc emission from larger radii. The
drop in coherence can be produced by disc accretion fluctuations arising at
larger radii which are viscously damped and hence unable to propagate to the
inner, power-law emitting region.

EE equations shows that fluctuations stabilize the whole system generating
elastic shear waves and increasing speed of sound. Those turbulent motions that

the details of observations of gravitational lensing in galaxies and groups of
galaxies, without the need of any dark matter. We show how all dynamical
observations on flat rotation curves and gravitational lensing can be
synthesised in terms of the empirically required metric coefficients of any
metric theory of gravity. We construct the corresponding metric components for
the theory presented at second order in perturbation, which are shown to be
perfectly compatible with the empirically derived ones. It is also shown that
under the theory being presented, in order to obtain a complete full agreement
with the observational results, a specific signature of Riemann's tensor has to
be chosen. This signature corresponds to the one most widely used nowadays in
relativity theory. Also, a computational program, the MEXICAS (Metric

gluon distributions. In this study we present the cross sections and rapidity
dependence of the photoproduction of heavy quarks and exclusive production of
vector mesons in ultraperipheral pPb and PbPb collisions at the Large Hadron
Collider at sqrt(s_NN)=5 TeV and sqrt(s_NN)=2.76$ TeV, respectively. The
potentials of using these processes for constraining nuclear gluon shadowing
are explored. It is found that photoproduction of $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ in
PbPb collisions in particular exhibit very good sensitivity to gluon shadowing.

derived for an energy harvesting transmitter with energy storage losses. In
particular, the energy harvesting transmitter is equipped with a battery that
loses a fraction of its stored energy. Both single user, i.e. one
transmitter-one receiver, and the broadcast channel, i.e., one
transmitter-multiple receiver settings are considered, initially with an
infinite capacity battery. It is shown that the optimal policies for these
models are threshold policies. Specifically, storing energy when harvested
power is above an upper threshold, retrieving energy when harvested power is
below a lower threshold, and transmitting with the harvested energy in between
is shown to maximize the weighted sum-rate. It is observed that the two
thresholds are related through the storage efficiency of the battery, and are
nondecreasing during the transmission. The results are then extended to the
case with finite battery capacity, where it is shown that a similar
double-threshold structure arises but the thresholds are no longer monotonic. A
dynamic program that yields an optimal online power allocation is derived, and
is shown to have a similar double-threshold structure. A simpler online policy
is proposed and observed to perform close to the optimal policy.

of inertial frames by the spinning hole. We solve the coupled post-Newtonian
equations describing the joint evolution of S and the stellar angular momenta
Lj, j = 1...N in spherical, rotating nuclear star clusters. In the absence of
gravitational interactions between the stars, two evolutionary modes are found:
(1) nearly uniform precession of S about the total angular momentum vector of
the system; (2) damped precession, leading, in less than one precessional
period, to alignment of S with the angular momentum of the rotating cluster.
Beyond a certain distance from the SBH, the time scale for angular momentum
changes due to gravitational encounters between the stars is shorter than
spin-orbit precession times. We present a model, based on the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck equation, for the stochastic evolution of star clusters due
to gravitational encounters and use it to evaluate the evolution of S in nuclei
where changes in the Lj are due to frame dragging close to the SBH and to
encounters farther out. Long-term evolution in this case is well described as
uniform precession of the SBH about the cluster's rotational axis, with an
increasingly important stochastic contribution when SBH masses are small. Spin
precessional periods are predicted to be strongly dependent on nuclear
properties, but typical values are 10-100 Myr for low-mass SBHs in dense
nuclei, 100 Myr - 10 Gyr for intermediate mass SBHs, and > 10 Gyr for the most
massive SBHs. We compare the evolution of SBH spins in stellar nuclei to the

any theory that respects our intuition of classicality.
  This exploration is divided in two parts: in the first we review classical
results of the literature, such as the Kochen-Specker theorem, von Neumann's
theorem, Gleason's theorem, as well as more recent ideas, such as the
distinction between $\psi$-ontic and $\psi$-epistemic ontological models,
Spekkens' definition of contextuality, Hardy's ontological excess baggage
theorem and the PBR theorem.
  The second part is concerned with pinning down what should be the ""correct""
definition of contextuality. We settle down on the definition advocated by
Abramsky and Branderburger, motivated by the Fine theorem, and show the
connection of this definition with the work of George Boole. This definition
allows us to unify the notions of locality and noncontextuality, and use
largely the same tools to characterize how quantum mechanics violates these
notions of classicality. Exploring this formalism, we find a new family of
noncontextuality inequalities. We conclude by reviewing the notion of
state-independent contextuality.

to extensive Dirac chains during the magnetic reversion.

present the detection of a frequency varying Lorentzian component in the

similar broad-band noise components have been associated to either the viscous

constraints on the accretion disk structure. In the viscous case we employ the
fluctuating accretion disk model to infer parameters for the viscosity and disk
scale height, and infer uncomfortably high parameters to be accommodated by the
standard thin disk, whilst in the dynamical case we infer a large accretion
disk truncation radius of ~10 white dwarf radii. More importantly however, the

galaxies between 0.1 $<$ z $\leq$ 0.84 from the All-Wavelength Extended Groth
Strip International Survey (AEGIS) and the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary
Probe 2 (DEEP2) survey. We find that bars are preferentially found in galaxies
that are massive and dynamically cold (rotation-dominated) and on the stellar
Tully-Fisher relationship, as is the case for barred spirals in the local
Universe. The data provide at least one explanation for the steep ($\times$3)
decline in the overall bar fraction from z=0 to z=0.84 in L$^*$ and brighter
disks seen in previous studies. The decline in the bar fraction at high
redshift is almost exclusively in the lower mass (10 $<$ log M$_{*}$(\Msun)$<$
11), later-type and bluer galaxies. A proposed explanation for this
""downsizing"" of the bar formation / stellar structure formation is that the
lower mass galaxies may not form bars because they could be dynamically hotter
than more massive systems from the increased turbulence of accreting gas,
elevated star formation, and/or increased interaction/merger rate at higher
redshifts. The evidence presented here provides observational support for this
hypothesis. However, the data also show that not every disk galaxy that is
massive and cold has a stellar bar, suggesting that mass and dynamic coldness
of a disk are necessary but not sufficient conditions for bar formation -- a
secondary process, perhaps the interaction history between the dark matter halo
and the baryonic matter, may play an important role in bar formation.

design of distributed cross-layer optimization algorithms have received
significant interest from the networking research community. So far, the
standard distributed cross-layer approach in the literature is based on
first-order Lagrangian dual decomposition and the subgradient method, which
suffers a slow convergence rate. In this paper, we make the first known attempt
to develop a distributed Newton's method, which is second-order and enjoys a
quadratic convergence rate. However, due to interference in wireless networks,
the Hessian matrix of the cross-layer problem has an non-separable structure.
As a result, developing a distributed second-order algorithm is far more
challenging than its counterpart for wireline networks. Our main results in
this paper are two-fold: i) For a special network setting where all links
mutually interfere, we derive decentralized closed-form expressions to compute
the Hessian inverse; ii) For general wireless networks where the interference
relationships are arbitrary, we propose a distributed iterative matrix
splitting scheme for the Hessian inverse. These results successfully lead to a
new theoretical framework for cross-layer optimization in wireless networks.
More importantly, our work contributes to an exciting second-order paradigm
shift in wireless networks optimization theory.

allows to achieve better throughput, but also assures nearly perfect fairness.

key problems that limit user's trust in these systems. First, paths for
anonymous communication are built without considering trust relationships
between users and relays in the system. Second, the network architecture relies
on a set of centralized servers. In this paper, we propose Pisces, a
decentralized protocol for anonymous communications that leverages users'
social links to build circuits for onion routing. We argue that such an
approach greatly improves the system's resilience to attackers.
  A fundamental challenge in this setting is the design of a secure process to
discover peers for use in a user's circuit. All existing solutions for secure
peer discovery leverage structured topologies and cannot be applied to
unstructured social network topologies. In Pisces, we discover peers by using
random walks in the social network graph with a bias away from highly connected
nodes to prevent a few nodes from dominating the circuit creation process. To
secure the random walks, we leverage the reciprocal neighbor policy: if
malicious nodes try to exclude honest nodes during peer discovery so as to
improve the chance of being selected, then honest nodes can use a tit-for-tat
approach and reciprocally exclude the malicious nodes from their routing
tables. We describe a fully decentralized protocol for enforcing this policy,
and use it to build the Pisces anonymity system.
  Using theoretical modeling and experiments on real-world social network

H^m(G(\sigma),L) of any irreducible kG(\sigma)-module L is bounded by a
constant depending on the root system \Phi\ of G and the integer m. A similar
result holds for the degree m cohomology of G_\sigma. These bounds are actually
established for the degree m extension groups Ext^m_{G(\sigma)}(L,L') between

the Apache Point Observatory 3.5m. The NIR images confirm the late-type galaxy
morphologies found by SDSS for these sources in all but a few (6 of 70) cases
(12 previously well-studied or misclassified sources were culled). Among 70
sources in the final sample, 33 show galaxy type SEDs, 17 have galaxy
components to their SEDs, and 20 have quasar power-law continua. At least 9
sources with galaxy SEDs have K-band flux densities too faint to be giant
ellipticals if placed at their photometric redshifts. Photometric redshifts for
this sample are analyzed and found to be too inaccurate for an efficient
radio-frequency absorption line search; spectroscopic redshifts are required. A
few new spectroscopic redshifts for these sources are presented here but more
will be needed to make significant progress in this field. Subsequent papers
will describe the radio continuum properties of the sample and the search for

a parameter to a probability distribution is one-to-one and if its Fisher
information matrix is always positive definite. If otherwise, it is called
singular. In regular statistical models, the Bayes free energy, which is
defined by the minus logarithm of Bayes marginal likelihood, can be
asymptotically approximated by the Schwarz Bayes information criterion (BIC),
whereas in singular models such approximation does not hold.
  Recently, it was proved that the Bayes free energy of a singular model is
asymptotically given by a generalized formula using a birational invariant, the
real log canonical threshold (RLCT), instead of half the number of parameters
in BIC. Theoretical values of RLCTs in several statistical models are now being
discovered based on algebraic geometrical methodology. However, it has been
difficult to estimate the Bayes free energy using only training samples,
because an RLCT depends on an unknown true distribution.
  In the present paper, we define a widely applicable Bayesian information
criterion (WBIC) by the average log likelihood function over the posterior
distribution with the inverse temperature $1/\log n$, where $n$ is the number
of training samples. We mathematically prove that WBIC has the same asymptotic
expansion as the Bayes free energy, even if a statistical model is singular for
and unrealizable by a statistical model. Since WBIC can be numerically
calculated without any information about a true distribution, it is a
generalized version of BIC onto singular statistical models.

(FE) discretizations of elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a
random coefficient, to estimate expected values of linear functionals of the
solution. The expected value is considered as an infinite-dimensional integral
in the parameter space corresponding to the randomness induced by the random
coefficient. We use a multi-level algorithm, with the number of QMC points
depending on the discretization level, and with a level-dependent dimension
truncation strategy. In some scenarios, we show that the overall error is
$\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, where $h$ is the finest FE mesh width, or
$\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\delta})$ for arbitrary $\delta>0$, where $N$ is the maximal
number of QMC sampling points. For these scenarios, the total work is
essentially of the order of one single PDE solve at the finest FE
discretization level. The analysis exploits regularity of the parametric
solution with respect to both the physical variables (the variables in the
physical domain) and the parametric variables (the parameters corresponding to
randomness). Families of QMC rules with ""POD weights"" (""product and order
dependent weights"") which quantify the relative importance of subsets of the
variables are found to be natural for proving convergence rates of QMC errors
that are independent of the number of parametric variables.

contributions to the noise budget of an image made with an array of dishes or
aperture array stations. Each noise contribution to the visibility data is
associated with a relevant correlation timescale and frequency bandwidth so
that the net impact on a complete observation can be assessed. All quantities
are parameterised as function of observing frequency and the visibility
baseline length. We apply the resulting noise budget analysis to a wide range
of existing and planned telescope systems that will operate between about 100
MHz and 5 GHz to ascertain the magnitude of the calibration challenges that
they must overcome to achieve thermal noise limited performance. We conclude
that calibration challenges are increased in several respects by small
dimensions of the dishes or aperture array stations. It will be more
challenging to achieve thermal noise limited performance using 15 m class
dishes rather than the 25 m dishes of current arrays. Some of the performance
risks are mitigated by the deployment of phased array feeds and more with the
choice of an (alt,az,pol) mount, although a larger dish diameter offers the
best prospects for risk mitigation. Many improvements to imaging performance
can be anticipated at the expense of greater complexity in calibration
algorithms. However, a fundamental limitation is ultimately imposed by an
insufficient number of data constraints relative to calibration variables. The
upcoming aperture array systems will be operating in a regime that has never
previously been addressed, where a wide range of effects are expected to exceed
the thermal noise by two to three orders of magnitude. Achieving routine
thermal noise limited imaging performance with these systems presents an
extreme challenge. The magnitude of that challenge is inversely related to the
aperture array station diameter.

spectrally efficient technique in future cellular systems. To exploit the
abundant patial resources provided by the cooperating base stations, however,
considerable training overhead is required to acquire the channel information.
To avoid the extra overhead outweighing the cooperative gain, we propose a
method that allows each user to select transmission mode between coherent CoMP
and Non-CoMP. We first analyze the average throughput of each user under CoMP
and Non-CoMP transmission after taking into account the downlink training
overhead. A closed-form mode selection rule is then developed, which depends on
the user location and system settings, i.e, the number of cooperating base
stations and transmit antennas, training overhead and cell-edge signal to noise
ratio. Simulation results show that the proposed downlink transmission mode
selection method achieves higher throughput than CoMP for cell-center users and
than Non-CoMP for cell-edge users after accounting for the overhead. As a
by-product, the backhaul load is also reduced significantly.

heavy ion collisions at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) facility,
and is now confirmed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) facility. The RHIC plus
LHC era provides a unique opportunity to study the jet-medium interaction that
leads to the jet quenching, and the medium itself at different collision
energies (medium temperatures).
  [Purpose:] We study the azimuthal anisotropy of jet quenching, to seek
constraints on different models featuring distinct path-length and density
dependences for jet energy loss, and to gain a better understanding of the
medium.
  [Methods:] The models are fixed by using the RHIC data, and then applied to
study the LHC case. A set of harmonic (Fourier) coefficients $v_{n}$ are
extracted from the jet azimuthal anisotropy on a event-by-event basis.
  [Results:] The second harmonics $v_{2}$, mostly driven by the medium's
geometry, can be used to differentiate jet quenching models. Other harmonics
are also compared with the LHC (2.76 TeV) data. The predictions for future LHC
(5.5 TeV) run are presented.
  [Conclusions:] We find that a too strong path-length dependence (e.g., cubic)
is ruled out by the LHC $v_{2}$ data, while the model with a strong near-$T_c$
enhancement for the jet-medium interaction describes the data very well. It is
worth pointing out that the latter model expects a less color-opaque medium at
LHC.

polarized solar spectrum formed due to coherent scattering processes. One such

between the hyperfine structure (F) states. We extend the redistribution matrix
derived for the J-state interference to the case of F-state interference. We
then incorporate it into the polarized radiative transfer equation and solve it
for isothermal constant property slab atmospheres. The relevant transfer
equation is solved using a polarized approximate lambda iteration (PALI)

the Neumann series expansion is also proposed and is found to be relatively
more efficient than the PALI method. The effects of PRD and the F-state

However, for some particular cases, such as for structures with strong

FETI in these particular cases is traced back to poor initial estimates of the

strategy for splitting interface forces between neighboring substructures is
proposed. The additional computational cost incurred is not significant. This
yields a new initialization for the FETI method and restores numerical

performing poorly. Various simple test problems are presented to discuss the
efficiency of the proposed strategy and to illustrate the so-obtained numerical

  Self-Organization",,"Acta Biotheoretica 60, 1 (2012) 55",,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microtubules, major elements of the cell skeleton are, most of the time, well
organized in vivo, but they can also show self-organizing behaviors in time
and/or space in purified solutions in vitro. Theoretical studies and models
based on the concepts of collective dynamics in complex systems,
reaction-diffusion processes and emergent phenomena were proposed to explain
some of these behaviors. In the particular case of microtubule spatial
self-organization, it has been advanced that microtubules could behave like
ants, self-organizing by 'talking to each other' by way of hypothetic (because
never observed) concentrated chemical trails of tubulin that are expected to be
released by their disassembling ends. Deterministic models based on this idea
yielded indeed like-looking spatio-temporal self-organizing behaviors.
Nevertheless the question remains of whether microscopic tubulin trails
produced by individual or bundles of several microtubules are intense enough to
allow microtubule self-organization at a macroscopic level. In the present
work, by simulating the diffusion of tubulin in microtubule solutions at the
microscopic scale, we measure the shape and intensity of tubulin trails and
discuss about the assumption of microtubule self-organization due to the
production of chemical trails by disassembling microtubules. We show that the
tubulin trails produced by individual microtubules or small microtubule arrays
are very weak and not elongated even at very high reactive rates. Although the
variations of concentration due to such trails are not significant compared to
natural fluctuations of the concentration of tubuline in the chemical
environment, the study shows that heterogeneities of biochemical composition
can form due to microtubule disassembly. They could become significant when
produced by numerous microtubule ends located in the same place. Their possible
formation could play a role in certain conditions of reaction. In particular,
it gives a mesoscopic basis to explain the collective dynamics observed in
excitable microtubule solutions showing the propagation of concentration waves
of microtubules at the millimeter scale, although we doubt that individual
microtubules or bundles can behave like molecular ants.

interesting results, two in some of which may force us to change the image of
thermal quasifermions: (1) The thermal mass of a quasifermion begins to
decrease as the strength of the coupling gets stronger and finally disappears
in the strong coupling region, thus showing a property of a massless particle,
and (2) its imaginary part (i.e., the decay width) persists to have $O(g^2T
\log(1/g))$ behavior. These results suggest that in the recently produced
strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma, the thermal mass of a quasiquark should
vanish. Taking into account the largeness of the imaginary part, it seems very
hard for a quark to exist as a qausiparticle in the strongly coupled
quark-gluon plasma phase. Other important findings are as follows: (3) The
collective plasmino mode disappears also in the strongly coupled system, and
(4) there exists an ultrasoft third peak in the quasifermion spectral density
at least in the weakly coupled QED/QCD plasma, indicating the existence of the
ultrasoft fermionic mode.

thickness is presented. Using Laplace transform method, the radiation and
material energy densities are obtained as a function of space and time. The
variation in integrated energy densities and leakage currents are also studied.
In order to linearize the radiation transport and material energy equation, the
heat capacity is assumed to be proportional to the cube of the material
temperature. The steady state energy densities show linear variation along the
depth of the planar slab, whereas non-linear dependence is observed for the
spherical shell. The analytical energy densities show good agreement with those

The benchmark results obtained in this work can be used to validate and verify

are selected from Caldwell et al. These star clusters have been observed as
part of the Beijing--Arizona--Taiwan--Connecticut (BATC) Multicolor Sky Survey
from 1995 February to 2008 March. The BATC images including these star clusters
are taken with 15 intermediate-band filters covering 3000--10000 \AA. Combined
with photometry in the {\sl GALEX} far- and near-ultraviolet, broad-band
$UBVRI$, SDSS $ugriz$, and infrared $JHK_{\rm s}$ of Two Micron All Sky Survey,
we obtain their accurate spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 1538-20000
\AA. We derive these star clusters' ages and masses by comparing their SEDs
with stellar population synthesis models. Our results are in good agreement
with previous determinations. The mean value of age and mass of young clusters
($<2$ Gyr) is about 385 Myr and $2\times 10^4 {M_\odot}$, respectively. There
are two distinct peaks in the age distribution, a highest peak at age $\sim$ 60
Myr and a secondary peak around 250 Myr, while the mass distribution shows a
single peak around $10^4 {M_\odot}$. A few young star clusters have two-body
relaxation times greater than their ages, indicating that those clusters have
not been well dynamically relaxed and therefore have not established the
thermal equilibrium. There are several regions showing aggregations of young
star clusters around the 10 kpc ring and the outer ring, indicating that the
distribution of the young star clusters is well correlated with M31's
star-forming regions. The young massive star clusters (age $\leq 100$ Myr and
mass $\geq 10^4 {M_\odot}$) show apparent concentration around the ring
splitting region, suggesting a recent passage of a satellite galaxy (M32)
through M31 disk.

in two stages namely, Query Identification and Solution Development. A person
referred to as customer will submit the problem details or requirements which
will be referred to as a query. Anyone who can provide a service will need to
register with the registrar module of the architecture. Services can be
anything ranging from expert consultancy in the field of agriculture to
academic research, from selling products to manufacturing goods, from medical
help to legal issues or even providing logistics. Query submitted by customer
is first parsed and then iteratively understood with the help of domain experts
and the customer to get a precise set of properties. Query thus identified will
be solved again with the help of intelligent agent systems which will search
the semantic web for all those who can find or provide a solution. A workable
solution workflow is created and then depending on the requirements, using the
techniques of negotiation or auctioning, solution is implemented to complete
the service for customer. This part is termed as solution development. In this
service oriented architecture, we first try to analyze the complex set of user
requirements then try to provide best possible solution in an optimized way by
combining better information searches through semantic web and better workflow

exposure of 300 kg yr, assuming a hypothetical detection of DM and studying a
series of benchmark points for the DM properties. We find that the effect of
these uncertainties can be similar in amplitude to that of astrophysical
uncertainties, especially in those cases where the spin-dependent contribution
to the elastic scattering cross-section is sizable.

Xenomai. One of the key characteristics of a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
is its ability to meet execution time deadlines deterministically. So, the more
precise and flexible the time management can be, the better it can handle
efficiently the determinism for different embedded applications. RTOS time
precision is characterized by a specific periodic interrupt service controlled
by a software time manager. The smaller the period of the interrupt, the better
the precision of the RTOS, the more it overloads the CPU, and though reduces
the overall efficiency of the RTOS. In this paper, we propose to drastically
reduce these overheads by migrating the time management service of Xenomai into
a configurable hardware component to relieve the CPU. The hardware component is
implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array coupled to the CPU. This work
was achieved in a Master degree project where students could apprehend many

applying a WKB approximation to the minimally coupled Dirac equation describing
an interaction between a massive fermion and an electromagnetic field. Making
use of the superposition principle we show that the +1 and -1 spin eigenstates

has been a renew interest in the investigation of nuclear reactions with heavy
ions near the Coulomb barrier. The role of inelastic and transfer channel
couplings in fusion reactions induced by stable heavy ions can be revisited.
Detailed Analysis of recent experimental fusion cross sections by using
standard coupled-channel calculations is first discussed. Multi-neutron
transfer effects are introduced in the fusion process below the Coulomb barrier
by analyzing 32S+90,96Zr as benchmark reactions. The enhancement of fusion
cross sections for 32S+96Zr is well reproduced at sub-barrier energies by NTFus
code calculations including the coupling of the neutron-transfer channels
following the Zagrebaev semi-classical model. Similar effects for 40Ca+90Zr and
40Ca+96Zr fusion excitation functions are found. The breakup coupling in both
the elastic scattering and in the fusion process induced by weakly bound stable
projectiles is also shown to be crucial. In the second part of this work, full
coupled-channel calculations of the fusion excitation functions are performed
by using the breakup coupling for the more neutron-rich reaction and for the
more weakly bound projectiles. we clearly demonstrate that
Continuum-Discretized Coupled-Channel calculations are capable to reproduce the
fusion enhancement from the breakup coupling in 6Li+59Co.

the pion that is also emitted. We also use an independent set of D0's coming
directly from the hadronization of the charm quark, but in this case the
flavour of the charmed meson is not known. We analyze events collected by the
BaBar experiment at the PEP-II asymmetric-energy e+e- collider, corresponding
to an integrated luminosity of 468 fb-1. We measure the mixing parameter value
to be yCP = [0.72 +- 0.18 (stat) +- 0.12 (syst)]%, and exclude the no-mixing
hypothesis at 3.3sigma significance. We find no evidence of CP violation,
observing DeltaY = [0.09 +- 0.26 (stat) +- 0.06 syst)]% which is consistent

(magnetars) which have been proposed as an explanation for the quasi-periodic
oscillations (QPOs) appearing in the decaying tail of the giant flares of soft
gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs). We extend previous studies by investigating various
magnetic field configurations, computing the Alfv\'en spectrum in each case and
performing magneto-elastic simulations for a selected number of models. By
identifying the observed frequencies of 28 Hz (SGR 1900+14) and 30 Hz (SGR
1806-20) with the fundamental Alfv\'en QPOs, we estimate the required surface
magnetic field strength. For the magnetic field configurations investigated
(dipole-like poloidal, mixed toroidal-poloidal with a dipole-like poloidal
component and a toroidal field confined to the region of field lines closing
inside the star, and for poloidal fields with an additional quadrupole-like
component) the estimated dipole spin-down magnetic fields are between 8x10^14 G
and 4x10^15 G, in broad agreement with spin-down estimates for the SGR sources
producing giant flares. A number of these models exhibit a rich Alfv\'en
continuum revealing new turning points which can produce QPOs. This allows one
to explain most of the observed QPO frequencies as associated with
magneto-elastic QPOs. In particular, we construct a possible configuration with
two turning points in the spectrum which can explain all observed QPOs of SGR
1900+14. Finally, we find that magnetic field configurations which are entirely
confined in the crust (if the core is assumed to be a type I superconductor)
are not favoured, due to difficulties in explaining the lowest observed QPO
frequencies (f<30 Hz).

in events containing four reconstructed jets associated with quarks. For masses

dominant and result primarily in two hadronic jets. An additional two jets can
be produced in the hadronic decay of a W or Z boson produced in association
with the Higgs boson, or from the incoming quarks that produced the Higgs boson
through the vector-boson fusion process. The search is performed using a sample
of \sqrt{s} = 1.96 TeV proton-antiproton collisions corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 9.45 fb-1 recorded by the CDF II detector. The data
are in agreement with the background model and 95% credibility level upper
limits on Higgs boson production are set as a function of the Higgs boson mass.
The median expected (observed) limit for a 125GeV/c2 Higgs boson is 11.0 (9.0)
times the predicted standard model rate.

contribution to the SNIa rate from the population of merging double
carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. We aim to develope a model that fits the observed

We differentiate between two scenarios for the common envelope (CE) evolution;
the alpha-formalism based on the energy equation and the gamma-formalism that
is based on the angular momentum equation. In one model we apply the
alpha-formalism always. In the second model the gamma-formalism is applied,
unless the binary contains a compact object or the CE is triggered by a tidal
instability for which the alpha-formalism is used. The binary population
synthesis code SeBa was used to evolve binary systems from the zero-age main
sequence to the formation of double white dwarfs and subsequent mergers. SeBa
has been thoroughly updated since the last publication of the content of the
code. The limited sample of observed double white dwarfs is better represented
by the simulated population using the gamma-formalism than the alpha-formalism.
For both CE formalisms, we find that although the morphology of the simulated
delay time distribution matches that of the observations within the errors, the
normalisation and time-integrated rate per stellar mass are a factor 7-12 lower
than observed. Furthermore, the characteristics of the simulated populations of
merging double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs are discussed and put in the context
of alternative SNIa models for merging double white dwarfs.

frequency of a game is determined by the payoff matrix of the game. This paper
reports the first experimental evidence to demonstrate this relationship.
Evidence comes from two populations randomly-matched $2\times2$ games with 12
different payoff matrix parameters. The directions, frequencies and changes in
the radius of the cycles are measured definitively. The main finding is that
the observed periodic frequencies of the persistent cycles are significantly
different in games with different parameters. Two replicator dynamics, standard
and adjusted, are employed as predictors for the periodic frequency.
Interestingly, both of the models could infer the difference of the observed
frequencies well. The experimental frequencies linearly, positively and
significantly relate to the theoretical frequencies, but the adjusted model
performs slightly better.

analytically. The pulsar equation is solved in the region close to the magnetic
axis. Proceeding from linearization of the current function in the axial
region, we find the axial magnetic flux function valid at any altitude above
the neutron star. This function is used as a starting approximation to develop
series for the non-linear pulsar equation in the polar region. Taking into
account the quasi-monopolar character of the pulsar magnetic flux at infinity,
we obtain unique asymptotic series for the flux and current functions. At
infinity, both functions are close but not equivalent to those known for the
case of a force-free monopole. The flux function at the top of the polar gap is
found to differ from the dipolar one at the neutron star surface. With our
results, the transverse current sheet closing the pulsar circuit at the neutron
star surface is consistently incorporated into the global magnetospheric

the stationary cascade scenario looks admissible. The present paper is the
first step toward complete analytic description of the pulsar force-free

luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential
velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis
that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our
implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic
representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to
the aperture problem similar to physio-logy and behavior. We demonstrate that
this solution is the result of two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate
the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features
independent of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are
explained away, while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global
scale. Most previous models included ad hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped
cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features as
necessary conditions to solve the aperture problem. Here, we have proved that
motion-based predictive coding, as it is implemented in this functional model,
is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This solution may give insights

employ the technique of asymptotic matching to join a perturbed Kerr metric in
the neighborhood of each spinning black hole to a near-zone, post-Newtonian

post-Minkowskian metric that accounts for full temporal retardation. The result
is a 4-metric that is approximately valid everywhere in space and in a small

that an increase in the strength of the correlation is accompanied by an
increase in the critical coupling strength for the onset of synchronization. We
further observe that the critical coupling can solely depend on the average

breaks down. If noise is present, the correlations have to be stronger to yield

non-Newtonian mathematical formalism thatis based upon a behavioral model of
Livings. The model is quantum-inspired: it represented by a modified Madelung
equation which the quantum potential is replaced by different, specially chosen
""computational"" potential. It consists of motor dynamics simulating actual
behavior of the object, and mental dynamics representing evolution of the
corresponding knowledge-based and incorporating this knowledge in the for m of
information flows into the motor dynamics. Due to feedback from mental
dynamics, motor dynamics attains quantum-like properties: its trajectory splits
into a family of different trajectories, and each of those trajectories can be
chosen with the probability prescribed by the mental dynamics. The model
addresses a new type of entanglement that correlates the probabilities of
actions of Livings rather than the actions themselves.

Hubble parameter and put constraints on cosmological models. We select 23,883
quiescent luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the SDSS DR7 and divide them into
four sub-samples according to their velocity dispersions and each sub-sample is
further divided into 12 redshift bins. The spectra of the LRGs in each redshift
and velocity bin are co-added in order to obtain a combined spectrum with
relatively high $S/N$. Adopting the GalexEV/SteLib model, we estimate the mean
ages of the LRGs from these combined spectra by the full-spectrum fitting
method. We check the reliability of the estimated age by using Monte-Carlo
simulations and find that the estimates are robust and reliable. Assuming that
the LRGs in each sub-sample and each redshift bin were on average formed at the
same time, the Hubble parameter at the present time $H_0$ is estimated from the
age--redshift relation obtained for each sub-sample, which is compatible with
the $H_0$ value measured by other methods. We demonstrate that a systematic
bias (up to $\sim 20%$) may be introduced to the $H_0$ estimation because of
recent star formation in the LRGs due to the later major mergers at $z\la 0.4$,
but this bias may be negligible for those sub-samples with large velocity
dispersions. Using the age--redshift relations obtained from the sub-sample
with the largest velocity dispersion or the two sub-samples with high velocity
dispersions, we find $H_0= 65^{+7}_{-3}\kmsmpc$ or $H_0= 74^{+5}_{-4}\kmsmpc$
by assuming a spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. With upcoming surveys,
such as the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), even larger samples
of quiescent massive LRGs may be obtained, and thus the Hubble parameter can be
measured with high accuracy through the age--redshift relation.

interplay among the atom-pair hopping, the on-site repulsion and the
nearest-neighbor repulsion. With on-site repulsion present, we observe first
order transitions between the Mott Insulators and pair superfluid driven by the
pair hopping. With the nearest-neighbor repulsion turning on, three typical
solid phases with 2/3, 1 and 4/3-filling emerge at small atom-pair hopping
region. A stable pair supersolid phase is found at small on-site repulsion.
This is due to the three-body constraint and the pair hopping, which
essentially make the model a quasi hardcore boson system. Thus the pair
supersolid state emerges basing on the order-by-disorder mechanism, by which
hardcore bosons avoid classical frustration on the triangular lattice. The
transition between the pair supersolid and the pair superfluid is first order,

model based on our current understanding of the evolution of main-sequence (MS)
and starburst (SB) galaxies. We rely on a simple Spectral Energy Distribution
(SED) library based on Herschel observations: a single SED for the MS and
another one for SB, getting warmer with redshift. Our model is able to
reproduce recent measurements of galaxy counts performed with Herschel,
including counts per redshift slice. This agreement demonstrates the power of
our 2 Star-Formation Modes (2SFM) decomposition for describing the statistical
properties of infrared sources and their evolution with cosmic time. We discuss
the relative contribution of MS and SB galaxies to the number counts at various
wavelengths and flux densities. We also show that MS galaxies are responsible
for a bump in the 1.4 GHz radio counts around 50 {\mu}Jy. Material of the model
(predictions, SED library, mock catalogs...) is available online at

create a false asymmetry. To measure the detector sensitivities, we modulate X,
X', Y, Y' using four air-core dipoles in the Hall C beamline as well as beam

the important question of its origin. Several models have already been
proposed. Here we suggest that a recent nova outburst has ejected a ring-like

and tail structure, and the unusually high eccentricity of the observed cloud
in a natural way, even as the nova moves on an orbit quite normal for the young

calculating orbits for the head and tail parts of the ejecta and the nova that

on the properties of the spectroscopic sub-classes of high excitation galaxies

possibly extended) emission in about 40% of the sources; the fraction is even
higher (8/10) restricting the analysis to the objects with exposure times
larger than 10 ks. In the 18 BLOs, extended emission is seen only in 2 objects;
this lower detection rate can be ascribed to the presence of their bright X-ray
nuclei that easily outshine any genuine diffuse emission.
  A very close correspondence between the soft X-ray and optical line
morphology emerges. We also find that the ratio between [O III] and extended
soft X-ray luminosity is confined within a factor of 2 around a median value of
5. Both results are similar to what is seen in Seyfert galaxies.
  We discuss different processes that could explain the soft X-ray emission and
conclude that the photoionization of extended gas, coincident with the narrow

frequency (RF) atmospheric pressure microplasmas operated in helium are
investigated by Particle in Cell simulations and semi-analytical modeling. A
strong heating of electrons and ionization in the plasma bulk due to high bulk
electric fields are observed at distinct times within the RF period. Based on
the model the electric field is identified to be a drift field caused by a low
electrical conductivity due to the high electron-neutral collision frequency at
atmospheric pressure. Thus, the ionization is mainly caused by ohmic heating in
this ""Omega-mode"". The phase of strongest bulk electric field and ionization is
affected by the driving voltage amplitude. At high amplitudes, the plasma
density is high, so that the sheath impedance is comparable to the bulk
resistance. Thus, voltage and current are about 45{\deg} out of phase and
maximum ionization is observed during sheath expansion with local maxima at the
sheath edges. At low driving voltages, the plasma density is low and the
discharge becomes more resistive resulting in a smaller phase shift of about
4{\deg}. Thus, maximum ionization occurs later within the RF period with a
maximum in the discharge center. Significant analogies to electronegative low
pressure macroscopic discharges operated in the Drift-Ambipolar mode are found,
where similar mechanisms induced by a high electronegativity instead of a high
collision frequency have been identified.

several decades by means of statistical models. However, accurate predictions
require some fine-tuning of the model parameters. This task can be simplified
by studying several entrance channels, which populate different regions of the
parameter space of the compound nucleus.
  Fusion reactions play an important role in this strategy because they
minimise the uncertainty on the entrance channel by fixing mass, charge and
excitation energy of the compound nucleus. If incomplete fusion is negligible,
the only uncertainty on the compound nucleus comes from the spin distribution.
However, some de-excitation channels, such as fission, are quite sensitive to
spin. Other entrance channels can then be used to discriminate between
equivalent parameter sets.
  The focus of this work is on fission and intermediate-mass-fragment emission
cross sections of compound nuclei with 70<=A<=240. The statistical
de-excitation model is GEMINI++. The choice of the observables is natural in
the framework of GEMINI++, which describes fragment emission using a
fission-like formalism. Equivalent parameter sets for fusion reactions can be
resolved using the spallation entrance channel. This promising strategy can
lead to the identification of a minimal set of physical ingredients necessary
for a unified quantitative description of nuclear de-excitation.

measurements performed on two distant physical systems should be uncorrelated
thus their quantum state should be separable it means described by a simple
tensor product of the individual local state vectors or a tensor product of
individual local density operators. It was shown many years ago by EPR that two
systems which interacted in the past and separated afterwards had to be
described in most cases by particular non-separable states which are called
entangled. It was noticed by Zanardi et al. that a Hilbert space of possible
state vectors of compound physical system could be partitioned in different way
by introducing various tensor product structures induced by the experimentally
accessible observables (interactions and measurements). Therefore a separable
state in one partition could become entangled in different partition. In this
sense the entanglement was relative to a particular set of experimental
capabilities. Continuing this line of thought Torre et al. claimed to prove
that for any separable state there existed strongly correlated physical
observables therefore all quantum states were entangled. The same claims one
may find in several recent papers. In this paper we will discuss in operational
way the differences existing between separable, non-separable and entangled
states and we will show that the conclusions of Torre et al. were unjustified.
A sufficient condition for entanglement is the violation of BI-CHSH and/or
steering inequalities. Since there exist experiments outside the quantum
physics violating these inequalities therefore in the operational approach one
cannot say that the entanglement is an exclusive quantum phenomenon.

a significant impact on the approximation error of the Nystr\""{o}m method. Our
approach is based on the concentration inequality of integral operator and the
theory of matrix perturbation. Our analysis shows that when there is a large
eigengap, we can improve the approximation error of the Nystr\""{o}m method from
$O(N/m^{1/4})$ to $O(N/m^{1/2})$ when measured in Frobenius norm, where $N$ is
the size of the kernel matrix, and $m$ is the number of sampled columns.

by the modified Rummukainen-Gottlieb formula for two-particle system with

effect of a mass $M$ on the metric at position r from it. It is proportional to
the dimensionless parameter $\beta^2 = 2GM/rc^2$, which normally is $<< 1$.
Here $G$ is the gravitational constant, $M$ the mass of the gravitating body,
$r$ the position of the metric from the gravitating body and $c$ the speed of
light. The seeable universe is the sphere, with center at the observer, having
a size such that it shall contain all light emitted within it. For this to
occur one can impose that the gravitational effect on the velocity of light at
$r$ is zero for the radial component, and non zero for the tangential one.
Light is then trapped. The condition is given by the equality $R_g = 2GM/c^2$,
where $R_g$ represents the radius of the {\it seeable} universe. It is the
gravitational radius of the mass $M$. The result has been presented elsewhere
as the condition for the universe to be treated as a black hole. According to
present observations, for the case of our universe taken as flat ($k = 0$), and
the equation of state as $p = - \rho c^2$, we prove here from the Einstein's
cosmological equations that the universe is expanding in an accelerated way as
$t^2$, a constant acceleration as has been observed. This implies that the
gravitational radius of the universe (at the event horizon) expands as $t^2$.
Taking $c$ as constant, observing the galaxies deep in space this means deep in
time as $ct$, linear. Then, far away galaxies from the observer that we see
today will disappear in time as they get out of the distance ct that is $<
R_g$. The accelerated expanding vacuum will drag them out of sight. This may be
a valid test for the present ideas in cosmology. Previous calculations are here
halved by our results.

becoming a ""need to have"" than a ""nice to have"" service. The net banking, thus,
now is more of a norm rather than an exception in many developed countries due
to the fact that it is the cheapest way of providing banking services. This

  migration and vaccination pressures",,,,,"q-bio.BM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Influenza virus contains two highly variable envelope glycoproteins,
hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The structure and properties of HA,
which is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected,
change significantly when the virus is transmitted from avian or swine species
to humans. Here we focus on much smaller human individual evolutionary amino
acid mutational changes in NA, which cleaves sialic acid groups and is required
for influenza virus replication. We show that very small amino acid changes can
be monitored very accurately across many Uniprot and NCBI strains using
hydropathicity scales to quantify the roughness of water film packages.
Quantitative sequential analysis is most effective with the differential
hydropathicity scale based on protein self-organized criticality (SOC). NA
exhibits punctuated evolution at the molecular scale, millions of times smaller
than the more familiar species scale, and thousands of times smaller than the
genomic scale. Our analysis shows that large-scale vaccination programs have
been responsible for a very large convergent reduction in influenza severity in
the last century, a reduction which is hidden from short-term studies of
vaccine effectiveness. Hydropathic analysis is capable of interpreting and even
predicting trends of functional changes in mutation prolific viruses.
