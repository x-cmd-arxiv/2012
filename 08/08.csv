strongly affected by the population and mass imbalances. Here we present phase
diagrams of atomic Fermi gases as they undergo BCS--Bose-Einstein condensation
(BEC) crossover with population and mass imbalances, using a pairing
fluctuation theory. We focus on the finite temperature and trap effects, with
an emphasis on the mixture of $^{6}$Li and $^{40}$K atoms. We show that there
exist exotic types of phase separation in the BEC regime as well as
sandwich-like shell structures at low temperature with superfluid or
pseudogapped normal state in the central shell in the BCS and unitary regimes,
especially when the light species is the majority. Such a sandwich-like shell
structure appear when the mass imbalance increases beyond certain threshold.
Our result is relevant to future experiments on the $^6$Li--$^{40}$K mixture
and possibly other Fermi-Fermi mixtures.

the energy release and initiates the onset of eruptions in the magnetar
magnetosphere. A self-consistent stationary, axisymmetric model of the magnetar
magnetosphere is constructed based on a force-free magnetic field configuration
which contains a helically twisted force-free flux rope. Given the complex
multipolar magnetic fields at the magnetar surface, we also develop a
convenient numerical scheme to solve the GS equation. Depending on the surface
magnetic field polarity, there exist two kinds of magnetic field
configurations, inverse and normal. For these two kinds of configurations,
variations of the flux rope equilibrium height in response to gradual surface
physical processes, such as flux injections and crust motions, are carefully
examined. We find that equilibrium curves contain two branches, one represents
a stable equilibrium branch, the other an unstable equilibrium branch. As a
result, the evolution of the system shows a catastrophic behavior: when the
magnetar surface magnetic field evolves slowly, the height of flux rope would
gradually reach a critical value beyond which stable equilibriums can no longer
be maintained. Subsequently the flux rope would lose equilibrium and the
gradual quasi-static evolution of the magnetar magnetosphere will be replaced
by a fast dynamical evolution. In addition to flux injections, the relative
motion of active regions would give rise to the catastrophic behavior and lead
to magnetic eruptions as well. We propose that a gradual process could lead to
a sudden release of magnetosphere energy on a very short dynamical timescale,
without being initiated by a sudden fracture in the crust of the magnetar. Some
implications of our model are also discussed.

the hydrostatic equilibrium equation accounting exactly for the radiation

atmospheres with various luminosities relative to the Eddington luminosity
L_Edd computed for the Thomson cross-section. The maximum relative luminosities
L/L_Edd reach values of up to 1.1 for high gravity models. The emergent spectra
of all models are redshifted and fitted by diluted blackbody spectra in the

correction factors f_c. The radiative acceleration g_rad in our luminous,
hot-atmosphere models is significantly smaller than in corresponding models

electron scattering cross-section, and therefore formally ""super-Eddington""

atmospheres are small for L / L_Edd < 0.8. For the same g_rad / g, the new f_c

  Modified Phase Field Crystal Equation",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we provide a detailed convergence analysis for an
unconditionally energy stable, second-order accurate convex splitting scheme
for the Modified Phase Field Crystal equation, a generalized damped wave
equation for which the usual Phase Field Crystal equation is a special
degenerate case. The fully discrete, fully second-order finite difference
scheme in question was derived in a recent work [2]. An introduction of a new
variable \psi, corresponding to the temporal derivative of the phase variable
\phi, could bring an accuracy reduction in the formal consistency estimate,
because of the hyperbolic nature of the equation. A higher order consistency
analysis by an asymptotic expansion is performed to overcome this difficulty.
In turn, second order convergence in both time and space is established in a
discrete L^\infty (0,T; H^3) norm.

nearby molecular cloud is thought to trigger the formation of new stars.
However, the importance of this mode of star formation is uncertain. This
investigation seeks to quantify triggered star formation (TSF) in IC 1396A
(a.k.a., the Elephant Trunk Nebula), a bright rimmed cloud (BRC) on the
periphery of the nearby giant HII region IC 1396 produced by the Trumpler 37
cluster. X-ray selection of young stars from Chandra X-ray Observatory data is
combined with existing optical and infrared surveys to give a more complete
census of the TSF population. Over 250 young stars in and around IC 1396A are
identified; this doubles the previously known population. A spatio-temporal
gradient of stars from the IC 1396A cloud toward the primary ionizing star HD
206267 is found. We argue that the TSF mechanism in IC 1396A is the
radiation-driven implosion process persisting over several million years.
Analysis of the X-ray luminosity and initial mass functions indicates that >140
stars down to 0.1 Msun were formed by TSF. Considering other BRCs in the IC
1396 HII region, we estimate the TSF contribution for the entire HII region
exceeds 14-25% today, and may be higher over the lifetime of the HII region.
Such triggering on the periphery of HII regions may be a significant mode of
star formation in the Galaxy.

unrestricted blocking mechanism. Being based on a conceptually simple rule,
unrestricted blocking performs case distinctions over whether two individuals

mechanism ties the proof of termination of tableau derivations to the finite

pronounced behind strong shocks and in low density regions, i.e., the middle
and high chromosphere. Concerning our models of different tube spreading, we
attained pronounced differences between the various types of models, which were
largely initiated by different degrees of dilution of the wave energy flux as
well as the density structure partially shaped by strong shocks, if existing.
Models showing a quasi-steady rise of temperature with height are obtained via
monochromatic waves akin to previous acoustic simulations. However,
longitudinal flux tube waves are identified as insufficient to heat the solar
transition region and corona in agreement with previous studies.

conservative approach assumes that we have only learned the k-dependence of the

conjointly accommodates the t\bar t forward-backward asymmetry observed at the

arising dominantly from new physics beyond the Standard Model, hint for a
flavor paradigm within partial compositeness models in which the right-handed
quarks of the first two generations are not elementary fields but rather
composite objects. We show that this class of models is consistent with current
data on flavor and CP violating physics, electroweak precision observables,
dijet and top pair resonance searches at hadron colliders. These models have
several predictions which will be tested in forthcoming experiments. The CP
asymmetry in D decays is induced through an effective operator of the form
(\bar u c)_{V+A}(\bar s s)_{V+A} at the charm scale, which implies a larger CP
asymmetry in the D^0\to K^+K^- rate relative the D^0\to \pi^+\pi^- channel.
This prediction is distinctive from other Standard Model or dipole-based new
physics interpretation of the LHCb result. CP violation in D-\bar D mixing as
well as an an excess of dijet production of the LHC are also predicted to be
observed in a near future. A large top asymmetry originates from the exchange
of an axial resonance which dominantly produces left-handed top pairs. As a
result a negative contribution to the lepton-based forward-backward asymmetry
in t\bar t production, as well as O(10%) forward-backward asymmetry in b\bar b
production above m_{b\bar b}\simeq 600GeV at the Tevatron is expected.

of galactic environments and metallicities, that star formation occurs
exclusively in the molecular phase of the interstellar medium (ISM).
Theoretical models show that this association results from the correlation
between chemical phase, shielding, and temperature. Interstellar gas converts
from atomic to molecular only in regions that are well shielded from
interstellar ultraviolet (UV) photons, and since UV photons are also the
dominant source of interstellar heating, only in these shielded regions does
the gas become cold enough to be subject to Jeans instability. However, while
the equilibrium temperature and chemical state of interstellar gas are
well-correlated, the time scale required to reach chemical equilibrium is much
longer than that required to reach thermal equilibrium, and both timescales are
metallicity-dependent. Here I show that the difference in time scales implies
that, at metallicities below a few percent of the Solar value, well-shielded
gas will reach low temperatures and proceed to star formation before the bulk
of it is able to convert from atomic to molecular. As a result, at extremely
low metallicities, star formation will occur in a cold atomic phase of the ISM
rather than a molecular phase. I calculate the observable consequences of this
result for star formation in low metallicity galaxies, and I discuss how some
current numerical models for H2-regulated star-formation may need to be

well-constrained universal exponential distribution beyond 0.2*r25 (inside of
which the scatter is large) with less than a factor of two scatter out to two
optical radii r25. Scaling the radius to r25 and the total gas surface density
to the surface density at the transition radius, i.e., where Sigma_HI and
Sigma_H2 are equal, as well as removing galaxies that are interacting with
their environment, yields a tightly constrained exponential fit with average
scale length 0.61+-0.06 r25. In this case, the scatter reduces to less than 40%
across the optical disks (and remains below a factor of two at larger radii).
We show that the tight exponential distribution of neutral gas implies that the
total neutral gas mass of nearby disk galaxies depends primarily on the size of
the stellar disk (influenced to some degree by the great variability of
Sigma_H2 inside 0.2*r25). The derived prescription predicts the total gas mass
in our sub-sample of 17 non-interacting disk galaxies to within a factor of
two. Given the short timescale over which star formation depletes the H2

studying the chemo-dynamical evolution in disk galaxies, which consists of
fusing disk chemical evolution models with compatible numerical simulations of
galactic disks. This method avoids known star formation and chemical enrichment
problems encountered in simulations. Here we focus on the Milky Way, by using a
detailed thin-disk chemical evolution model and a simulation in the
cosmological context, with dynamical properties close to those of our Galaxy.
We show that, due to radial migration from mergers at high redshift and the
central bar at later times, a sizable fraction of old metal-poor
high-[alpha/Fe] stars reaches the solar vicinity. This naturally accounts for a
number of recent observations related to both the thin and thick disks, despite
the fact that we use thin-disk chemistry only. Although significant radial
mixing is present, the slope in the age-metallicity relation is only weakly
affected, with a scatter compatible with recent observational work. While we
find a smooth density distribution in the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane, we can recover
the observed discontinuity by selecting particles according to kinematic
criteria used in high-resolution samples to define the thin and thick disks. We
outline a new method for estimating the birth place of the Sun and predict that
the most likely radius lies in the range 4.4 < r < 7.7 kpc (for a location at r
= 8 kpc). A new, unifying model for the Milky Way thick disk is offered, where
both mergers and radial migration play a role at different stages of the disk
evolution. We show that in the absence of early-on massive mergers the vertical
velocity dispersion of the oldest stars is underestimated by a factor of ~2
compared with observations. We can, therefore, argue that the Milky Way thick
disk is unlikely to have been formed through a quiescent disk evolution.

assumptions on the physics of the stellar structure and the atmospheric
radiative transfer. This leads to biased theoretical predictions on the
photospheric Spectral Energy Distributions of Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) stars,
and affects the derivation of stellar parameters from photometric data. Our
goal is to correct the biases present in the theoretical predictions for the
near-IR photometry of low-mass PMS stars. Using empirical intrinsic IR colors,
we assess the accuracy of current synthetic spectral libraries and evolutionary
models. We consider a sample of ~300 PMS stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (age
1 Myr) with measured luminosities, temperatures and photospheric JHKs
photometry. By analyzing the photospheric colors of our sample of stars, we
find that the synthetic JHKs photometry provided by theoretical spectral
templates for late spectral types (>K6) are accurate at the level of ~0.2 mag,
while colors are accurate at ~0.1 mag. We tabulate the intrinsic photospheric
colors, appropriate for the Orion Nebula Cluster, in the range K6-M8.5. They
can be conveniently used as templates for the intrinsic colors of other young
(age<5 Myr) stellar clusters. An empirical correction of the atmospheric
templates can fix the discrepancies between expected and observed colors.
Still, other biases in the evolutionary models prevent a more robust comparison
between observations and theoretical absolute magnitudes. In particular, PMS
evolutionary models seem to consistently underestimate the intrinsic
near-infrared flux at the very late spectral types, and this may introduce
spurious features in the low-mass end of the photometrically-determined Initial
Mass Function of young clusters.

expected costs $\mathbb {E}[c(X_1,X_2)]$ by varying the joint distribution
$(X_1,X_2)$ where the marginal distributions of the random variables $X_1$ and
$X_2$ are fixed. Inspired by recent applications in mathematical finance and
connections with the peacock problem, we study this problem under the
additional condition that $(X_i)_{i=1,2}$ is a martingale, that is, $\mathbb
{E}[X_2|X_1]=X_1$. We establish a variational principle for this problem which
enables us to determine optimal martingale transport plans for specific cost
functions. In particular, we identify a martingale coupling that resembles the
classic monotone quantile coupling in several respects. In analogy with the
celebrated theorem of Brenier, the following behavior can be observed: If the
initial distribution is continuous, then this ""monotone martingale"" is
supported by the graphs of two functions $T_1,T_2:\mathbb {R}\to \mathbb {R}$.

XLF of sources associated with older stellar populations has a steeper slope

theory as a theory of a spin-2 field coupled to gravity. This requires
identifying a gravitational metric and parameterizing deviations of the
resulting theory from general relativity. To this end, we first consider the
most general bimetric backgrounds for which a massless and a massive spin-2
fluctuation with Fierz-Pauli mass exist. These backgrounds coincide with
solutions in general relativity. Based on this, we obtain nonlinear extensions
of the massive and massless spin-2 fields. The background value of the
nonlinear massive field parameterizes generic deviations of the bimetric theory
from GR. It is also shown that the nonlinear massless field does not have
standard ghost-free matter couplings, and hence cannot represent the
gravitational metric. However, an appropriate gravitational metric can still be
identified in the weak gravity limit. Hence in the presence of other neutral
spin-2 fields, the weak gravity limit is crucial for compatibility with general
relativity. We also write down the action in terms of the nonlinear massive
spin-2 field and obtain its ghost-free couplings to matter. The discussion is
then generalized to multimetric theories.

acceleration H v_r, where v_r is the radial velocity of the binary's proper
orbital motion, would experience long-term temporal changes of both its
semimajor axis a and the eccentricity e qualitatively different from any other
standard competing effect for them. Contrary to what one might reasonably
expect, the analytical expressions of such rates do not vanish in the limit
M--> 0, where M is the mass of the primary, being independent of it. This is a
general requirement that any potentially viable physical mechanism able to
provide such a putative acceleration should meet. Nonetheless, if H had the
same value H_0 of the Hubble parameter at present epoch, such rates of change
would have magnitude close to the present-day level of accuracy in determining
planetary orbital motions in our Solar System. A tension with recent
observations may even be present for Mercury and Mars. However, general
relativity, applied to a localized gravitationally bound binary system immersed
in an expanding Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker, does not predict the
existence of such a putative radial acceleration at Newtonian level. Instead,
it was recently shown in literature that an acceleration of order H and
directed along the velocity v of the test particle occurs at post-Newtonian
level. We worked out its orbital effects finding well-behaved secular rates of
change for both a and e proportional to the Schwarzschild radius r_s of the
primary. Their magnitude is quite small: the rate of change of a amounts to
just 20 microns per century in our Solar System. Finally, we discussed certain
basic criteria of viability that modified models of gravity should generally
meet when their observable effects are calculated.

this prominence before the eruption. This prominence contains two parts: an
active region part containing mainly horizontal threads, and a quiet Sun part
containing mainly vertical threads. On the northern side of the prominence
channel, both AIA and EUVI observe bright features which appear to be the lower
legs of loops that go above then join in the filament. Filament materials are
observed to frequently eject horizontally from the active region part to the
quiet Sun part. This ejection results in the formation of a dense-column
structure (concentration of dark vertical threads) near the border between the
active region and the quiet Sun. Using the flux rope insertion method, we
create non-linear force-free field models based on SDO/HMI line-of-sight
magnetograms. A key feature of these models is that the flux rope has
connections with the surroundings photosphere, so its axial flux varies along
the filament path. The height and location of the dips of field lines in our
models roughly replicate those of the observed prominence. Comparison between
model and observations suggests that the bright features on the northern side
of the channel are the lower legs of the field lines that turn into the flux
rope. We suggest that plasma may be injected into the prominence along these
field lines. Although the models fit the observations quiet well, there are
also some interesting differences. For example, the models do not reproduce the
observed vertical threads and cannot explain the formation of the dense-column
structure.

expansion model $r(t)$ that consists of an exponentially growing acceleration
phase, followed by a deceleration phase that is parameterized by the

includes the logistic growth limit ($\beta=0$), sub-diffusion ($\beta = 0-1$),
classical diffusion ($\beta=1$), super-diffusion ($\beta = 1-2$), and the
linear expansion limit ($\beta=2$). We analyze all M and X-class flares
observed with GOES and AIA/SDO during the first two years of the SDO mission,
amounting to 155 events. We find that most flares operate in the sub-diffusive
regime ($\beta=0.53\pm0.27$), which we interpret in terms of anisotropic chain
reactions of intermittent magnetic reconnection episodes in a low
plasma-$\beta$ corona. We find a mean propagation speed of $v=15\pm12$ km
s$^{-1}$, with maximum speeds of $v_{max}=80 \pm 85$ km s$^{-1}$ per flare,
which is substantially slower than the sonic speeds expected for thermal
diffusion of flare plasmas. The diffusive characteristics established here (for

switchyard networks dates back to Knuth in 1968. In this work, we are
interested in permutations which are sortable on a double-ended queue (called a
deque), or on two parallel stacks. In 1982, Rosenstiehl and Tarjan presented an
O(n) algorithm for testing whether a given permutation was sortable on parallel
stacks. In the same paper, they also presented a modification giving O(n) test
for sortability on a deque. We demonstrate a slight error in the version of
their algorithm for testing deque sortability, and present a fix for this
problem.
  The general enumeration problem for both of these classes of permutations
remains unsolved. What is known is that the growth rate of both classes is
approximately Theta(8^n), so computing the number of sortable permutations of
length n, even for small values of n, is difficult to do using any method that
must evaluate each sortable permutation individually. As far as we know, the
number of deque sortable permutations was known only up to n=14. This was
computed using algorithms which effectively generate all sortable permutations.
By using the symmetries inherent in the execution of Tarjan's algorithm, we
have developed a new dynamic programming algorithm which can count the number
of sortable permutations in both classes in O(n^5 2^n) time, allowing the
calculation of the number of deque and parallel stack sortable permutation for
much higher values of n than was previously possible.

increasing the carrier density and the conductivity which, in turn, suppresses

Standard Model predictions for its production and decay. In a variety of
supersymmetric models, a neutralino NLSP can decay dominantly to the Higgs and
the LSP. In natural SUSY models, a light third generation squark decaying
through this chain can lead to large excess Higgs production while evading
existing BSM searches. Such models can be observed at the 8 TeV LHC in channels
exploiting the rare diphoton decays of the Higgs produced in the cascade decay.
Identifying a diphoton resonance in association with missing energy, a lepton,
or b-tagged jets is a promising search strategy for discovery of these models,
and would immediately signal new physics involving production of a Higgs boson.
We also discuss the possibility that excess Higgs production in these SUSY
decays can be responsible for enhancements of up to 50% over the SM prediction

which would likely by the end of the 8 TeV run be accompanied by excesses in

the single particle emissions and fission in this energy regime. Indeed, the
inclusion of these channels along the decay evaporating chain shows that the
yield of charged particles and occurrence of fission are affected by these

the single sequential emission results. The effect also shows a qualitative
change in the neutron multiplicity of different heavy compound nucleus

small R lead to a crossover from the CZD predicted by the theory of Pimpinelli

decays. The corresponding ISD also cross over from Gaussian or faster decays to
simple exponential ones. For fractal islands, these features are explained by
changes in the island growth kinetics, from a competition for capture of
diffusing adatoms (PE scaling) to aggregation of adatoms with effectively
irrelevant diffusion, which is characteristic of random sequential adsorption
(RSA) without surface diffusion. This interpretation is confirmed by studying
the crossover with similar CZ areas (of order 100 sites) in a model with
freezing of diffusing adatoms that corresponds to i=0. For square islands,
deviations from PE predictions appear for coverages near \theta=0.2 and are

The Lagrangian exhibits a nonlinear realization of (approximate) $SU(2)_{L}
\otimes SU(2)_{R}$ chiral symmetry and incorporates vector meson dominance. In
the calculation, a revised version of the so-called ""optimal approximation"" is
applied, in which one-nucleon interaction amplitude is factorized out and its
medium-modifications are included. The distortion of final pion wave function
is calculated using the Eikonal approximation. In addition, we briefly mention
the ambiguity of off-shell interaction amplitude. To benchmark the

then applied to study the neutrinoproductions. In the pion photoproduction and
NC photon production, we are able to address the contributions of two contact
terms that are partially related to the proposed anomalous interactions
involving $\omega (\rho)$ $Z$ boson and photon. The calculation is focused on

of asymptotically AdS spacetimes indicate that AdS spacetimes are generically
singular even if a closed trapped surface, which is one of the main conditions

This may lead one to expect to obtain a singularity theorem without imposing
the existence of a trapped set in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. This, however,
does not appear to be the case. We consider, within the use of global methods,
two such attempts and discuss difficulties in eliminating conditions concerning
a trapped set from singularity theorems in asymptotically AdS spacetimes. Then
in the second part, we restrict our attention to the specific case of
spherically symmetric, perfect fluid systems in asymptotically AdS spacetime,

closed trapped surface must form, and as a combined result with Hawking and
Penrose's theorem, that such a spacetime must be singular.

to each tile edge. The assembly process is driven by positive and negative
force interactions between glue types, allowing for tile assemblies floating in
the plane to combine and break apart over time. We refer to this type of
assembly model as passive in that the constituent parts remain unchanged
throughout the assembly process regardless of their interactions. A
computationally universal system is said to be fuel efficient if the number of
tiles used up per computation step is bounded by a constant. Work within this
model has shown how fuel guzzling tile systems can perform universal
computation with only positive strength glue interactions. Recent work has
introduced space-efficient, fuel-guzzling universal computation with the
addition of negative glue interactions and the use of a powerful non-diagonal
class of glue interactions. Other recent work has shown how to achieve fuel
efficient computation within active tile self-assembly. In this paper we
utilize negative interactions in the tile self-assembly model to achieve the
first computationally universal passive tile self-assembly system that is both

Investigation of such effects requires spatial-spectral representation of the

originates from the impurity scattering by Co atoms substituted for the Fe

paramagnetic-tetragonal phase, a Co impurity transforms to a weak and isotropic

inflation by examining trapped particle orbits. This large-amplitude scattering
is caused by the seed modifying the distribution function earlier in the

to parts of the seeds undergoing kinetic inflation and reaching amplitudes
several times more than the steady-state linear theory results. Simulations
with continuous seeds demonstrate that the onset of inflation depends on seed

Centauri and find that the blue main sequence (bMS) can be reproduced only by
models that have a of helium abundance in the range Y=0.35-$0.40. To explain
the faint subgiant branch of the reddest stars (""MS-a/RG-a"" sequence),
isochrones for the observed metallicity ([Fe/H]\approx0.7) appear to require
both a high age (~13Gyr) and enhanced CNO abundances ([CNO/Fe]\approx0.9$).
Y~0.35 must also be assumed in order to counteract the effects of high CNO on
turnoff colors, and thereby to obtain a good fit to the relatively blue turnoff
of this stellar population. This suggest a short chemical evolution period of
time (<1Gyr) for Omega Cen. Our intermediate-mass (super-)AGB models are able
to reproduce the high helium abundances, along with [N/Fe]~2 and substantial O
depletions if uncertainties in the treatment of convection are fully taken into
account. These abundance features distinguish the bMS stars from the dominant
[Fe/H] $\approx1.7$ population. The most massive super-AGB stellar models
(M_zams>=6.8M_sun, M_He,core>=1.245M_sun) predict too large N-enhancements,
which limits their role in contributing to the extreme populations. We show
quantitatively that highly He- and N-enriched AGB ejecta have particularly
efficient cooling properties. Based on these results and on the reconstruction
of the orbit of Omega Cen with respect to the Milky Way we propose the galactic
plane passage gas purging scenario for the chemical evolution of this cluster.
Our model addresses the formation and properties of the bMS population
(including their central location in the cluster). We follow our model
descriptively through four passage events, which could explain not only some
key properties of the bMS, but also of the MS-a/RGB-a and the s-enriched stars.

Mott insulator LaTiO3 films on TiO2 terminated SrTiO3 show remarkably
similarities. Two types of non-equilibrium carriers are generated in each
system, having a signature of a particular type of perturbation characterized
by distinctly different relaxation process. While, the photo-conducting state
diminishes in a stretched exponential manner, with a temperature dependent
activation energy varying from few tens of meV to ~ 1 to 2 meV on lowering the
temperature, and a relaxation time of several hours, the recovery from
electrostatic gating occurs in milli-seconds time scale. An attempt is also
made to explain the experimental observations using the ab-initio density
functional calculations. The calculations show that the electronic transitions
associated with near ultra-violet radiation emerge from bands located at ~ 2 eV
above and below the Fermi energy, which are the Ti 3d states of the SrTiO3
substrate, and that from the AlO2 (TiO2) layers of the LaAlO3 (LaTiO3) films,

explained in terms of the closely spaced Ti 3dxy states in the lower conduction

redshift, half as many radio-loud as radio-quiet galaxies have experienced
significant star formation in the past Gyr. (2) The Balmer absorption line
properties of massive galaxies that have experienced recent star formation show
that star formation occurred as a burst in many of these systems. (3) Both the

redshift. However, radio galaxies with similar stellar population parameters,
have similar emission-line properties both at high- and at low-redshift. These
results suggest that massive galaxies experience cyclical episodes of gas
accretion, star formation and black hole growth, followed by the production of
a radio jet that shuts down further activity. The behaviour of galaxies with

the linearized Hamiltonian operator appearing in each iteration of the
self-consistent field method. Building on the linear-scaling method, we
introduce a spatial approximation scheme resulting in a coarse-grained Density

resolution where necessary and to coarsen elsewhere. This coarse-graining step
enables the analysis of defects at a fraction of the original computational

coding gains, and STBC-schemes consisting of these STBCs have a non-vanishing
determinant (NVD) so that they are DMT-optimal for their respective MIDO
systems. It is also shown that the SR-code [R. Vehkalahti, C. Hollanti, and F.

lowest ML-decoding complexity among known rate-2 STBCs for the $4\times2$ MIDO
system with a large coding gain for 4-/16-QAM, has the same algebraic structure
as the STBC constructed in this paper for the $4\times2$ system. This also
settles in positive a previous conjecture that the STBC-scheme that is based on

three-dimensional structure and make it play a specific function impose
structural and functional constraints on each residue site. Selective
constraints on residue sites are recorded in amino acid orders in homologous
sequences and also in the evolutionary trace of amino acid substitutions. A
challenge is to extract direct dependences between residue sites by removing
indirect dependences through other residues within a protein or even through
other molecules. Recent attempts of disentangling direct from indirect
dependences of amino acid types between residue positions in multiple sequence
alignments have revealed that the strength of inferred residue pair couplings
is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures.
Here, we report an alternative attempt of inferring co-evolving site pairs from
concurrent and compensatory substitutions between sites in each branch of a
phylogenetic tree. First, branch lengths of a phylogenetic tree inferred by the
neighbor-joining method are optimized as well as other parameters by maximizing
a likelihood of the tree in a mechanistic codon substitution model. Mean
changes of quantities, which are characteristic of concurrent and compensatory
substitutions, accompanied by substitutions at each site in each branch of the
tree are estimated with the likelihood of each substitution. Partial
correlation coefficients of the characteristic changes along branches between
sites are calculated and used to rank co-evolving site pairs. Accuracy of
contact prediction based on the present co-evolution score is comparable to
that achieved by a maximum entropy model of protein sequences for 15 protein
families taken from the Pfam release 26.0. Besides, this excellent accuracy
indicates that compensatory substitutions are significant in protein evolution.

relativistic effect has not been observed thus far, the question arises that
whether this effect becomes detectable in view of todays high-precision
astrometry which soon will reach the microarcsecond level of accuracy. The
effect is studied and its observability is investigated. It turns out, that in
total there are about 1000 binaries having orbital parameters such that the
light deflection amounts to be at least 1 microarcsecond. Two stringent
criteria for the orbital parameters are presented, by means of which one can
easily determine the maximal value of light deflection effect for a given
binary system. It is found, that for relevant binaries their orbital parameters
must take rather extreme values in order to have a light deflection of the
order of a few microarcseconds. Only in a very few and rather extreme binary
systems the light deflection effect might be detectable by todays astrometry,
but their existence is highly improbable. Thus, the detection of this subtle
effect of relativity still remains a challenge for future astrometric missions.

sample of 68 nearby active galactic nuclei from the INTEGRAL all-sky hard X-ray
(HX) survey. This is the first HX-selected (above 15 keV) sample of AGNs with
complementary high angular resolution, high signal to noise, MIR data.
Correcting for the host galaxy contribution, we find a correlation between HX
and MIR luminosities: L_MIR L_HX^(0.74+/-0.06). Assuming that the observed MIR
emission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dusty
torus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (as
inferred from the declining fraction of obscured AGNs), the intrinsic disk
luminosity, L_D, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the corona
in the 2-300 keV energy band, L_C, with the L_D/L_C ratio varying by a factor
of 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6. This ratio is a factor of ~2 smaller than
for typical quasars producing the cosmic X-ray background (CXB). Therefore,
over three orders of magnitude in luminosity, HX radiation carries a large, and
roughly comparable, fraction of the bolometric output of AGNs. We estimate the
cumulative bolometric luminosity density of local AGNs at ~(1-3)x10^40
erg/s/Mpc^3. Finally, the Compton temperature ranges between kT_c~2 and ~6 keV
for nearby AGNs, compared to kT_c~2 keV for typical quasars, confirming that
radiative heating of interstellar gas can play an important role in regulating
SMBH growth.

The implied literals of each literal is computed dynamically during the search.
Therefore, it is call a dynamic phase selection strategy. In general, computing
dynamically a weight is time-consuming. Hence, so far no SAT solver applies
successfully a dynamic phase selection. Since the implied literal of our
strategy conforms to that of the search process, the usual two watched-literals
scheme can be applied here. Thus, the cost of our dynamic phase selection is
very low. To improve Glucose 2.0 which won a Gold Medal for application

Glucose improved by the dynamic phase selection is significantly better than

tauNL of the collapsed limit of the four-point correlator of the primordial
curvature perturbation and the amplitude fNL of the squeezed limit of its
three-point correlator. While a convincing detection of non-Gaussianity through
the squeezed limit of the three-point correlator would rule out all
single-field models, a robust confirmation or disproval of the inequality
between tauNL and fNL would provide crucial information about the validity of
multi-field models of inflation. In this paper, we discuss to which extent
future measurements of the scale-dependence of galaxy bias can test multi-field
inflationary scenarios. The strong degeneracy between the effect of a
non-vanishing fNL and tauNL on halo bias can be broken by considering multiple
tracer populations of the same surveyed volume. If halos down to 1e13 Msun/h
are resolved in a survey of volume 25(Gpc/h)^3, then testing multi-field models
of inflation at the 3-\sigma level would require, for instance, a detection of
tauNL at the level of tauNL~1e5 given a measurement of a local bispectrum with
amplitude fNL~10. However, we find that disproving multi-field models of
inflation with measurements of the non-Gaussian bias only will be very
challenging, unless |fNL| > 80 and one can achieve a halo mass resolution of

neutral hydrogen (HI) signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We have used
150 MHz GMRT observations to characterize the statistical properties of the
foregrounds in four different fields of view. The measured multi-frequency
angular power spectrum C_l(Delta nu) is found to have values in the range 10^4
mK^2 to 2 x 10^4 mK^2 across 700 <= l <= 2 x 10^4 and Delta nu <= 2.5 MHz,
which is consistent with model predictions where point sources are the most
dominant foreground component. The measured C_l(Delta nu) does not show a
smooth Delta nu dependence, which poses a severe difficulty for foreground
removal using polynomial fitting.
  The observational data was used to assess point source subtraction.
Considering the brightest source (~ 1 Jy) in each field, we find that the
residual artifacts are less than 1.5% in the most sensitive field (FIELD I). We
have used FIELD I, which has a rms noise of 1.3 mJy/Beam, to study the
properties of the radio source population to a limiting flux of 9 mJy. The
differential source count is well fitted with a single power law of slope -1.6.
We find there is no evidence for flattening of the source counts towards lower
flux densities which suggests that source population is dominated by the
classical radio-loud Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN).
  The diffuse Galactic emission is revealed after the point sources are
subtracted out from FIELD I . We find C_l \propto l^{-2.34} for 253 <= l <= 800
which is characteristic of the Galactic synchrotron radiation measured at
higher frequencies and larger angular scales. We estimate the fluctuations in
the Galactic synchrotron emission to be sqrt{l(l+1)C_l/2 pi} ~ 10 K at l=800
(theta > 10'). The measured C_l is dominated by the residual point sources and
artifacts at smaller angular scales where C_l ~ 10^3 mK^2 for l > 800.

measurements on large grain ceramic PZT with compositions near the two
morphotropic phase boundaries (MPBs) that the ferroelectric (FE) rhombohedral
phase has with the Zr-rich antiferroelectric and Ti-rich FE tetragonal phases.
These results are discussed together with similar data from previous series of
samples, and reveal new features of the phase diagram of PZT, mainly connected
with octahedral tilting and its coupling with the polar modes. Additional
evidence is provided of what we interpret as the onset of the tilt instability,
when is initially frustrated by lattice disorder, and the long range order is
achieved at lower temperature. Its temperature T_IT(x) prosecutes the long
range tilt instability line T_T(x) up to T_C, when T_T. It is proposed that the
difficulty of seeing the expected 1/2<111> modulations in diffraction
experiments is due to the large correlation volume associated with that type of
tilt fluctuations combined with strong lattice disorder. It is shown that the
lines of the tilt instabilities tend to be attracted and merge with those of
polar instabilities. Not only T_IT bends toward T_C and then merges with it,
but in our series of samples the temperature T_MPB of the dielectric and
anelastic maxima at the rhombohedral/tetragonal MPB does not cross T_T, but
deviates remaining parallel or possibly merging with T_T. These features,
together with a similar one in NBT-BT, are discussed in terms of cooperative
coupling between tilt and FE instabilities, which may trigger a common phase
transition. An analogy is found with recent simulations of the tilt and FE
transitions in multiferroic BiFeO3. An abrupt change is found in the shape of
the anelastic anomaly at T_T when x passes from 0.465 to 0.48, possibly
indicative of a rhombohedral/monoclinic boundary.

  Applied Physics - no supplemental material available on arXiv.org",,"10.1063/1.4761997",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Chalcogenide materials have received great attention in the last decade owing
to their application in new memory systems. Recently, phase-change memories
have, in fact, reached the early stages of production. In spite of the
industrial exploitation of such materials, the physical processes governing the
switching mechanism are still debated. In this paper we work out a complete and
consistent model for transport in amorphous chalcogenide materials based on
trap-limited conduction accompanied by carrier heating. A previous model is
here extended to include position-dependent carrier concentration and field,
consistently linked by the Poisson equation. The results of the new model
reproduce the experimental electrical characteristics and their dependences on
the device length and temperature. Furthermore, the model provides a sound
physical interpretation of the switching phenomenon and is able to give an
estimate of the threshold condition in terms of the material parameters, a
piece of information of great technological interest.

nebula (PWN) detected in gamma rays, N157B, located in the large Magellanic
Cloud (LMC). Pulsars with high spin-down luminosity are found to power
energised nebulae that emit gamma rays up to energies of several tens of TeV.
N157B is associated with PSRJ0537-6910, which is the pulsar with the highest
known spin-down luminosity. The High Energy Stereoscopic System telescope array
observed this nebula on a yearly basis from 2004 to 2009 with a dead-time
corrected exposure of 46 h. The gamma-ray spectrum between 600 GeV and 12 TeV
is well-described by a pure power-law with a photon index of 2.8 \pm 0.2(stat)
\pm 0.3(syst) and a normalisation at 1 TeV of (8.2 \pm 0.8(stat) \pm 2.5(syst))
\times 10^-13 cm^-2s^-1TeV^-1. A leptonic multi-wavelength model shows that an
energy of about 4 \times 10^49erg is stored in electrons and positrons. The
apparent efficiency, which is the ratio of the TeV gamma-ray luminosity to the
pulsar's spindown luminosity, 0.08% \pm 0.01%, is comparable to those of PWNe
found in the Milky Way. The detection of a PWN at such a large distance is
possible due to the pulsar's favourable spin-down luminosity and a bright
infrared photon-field serving as an inverse-Compton-scattering target for
accelerated leptons. By applying a calorimetric technique to these
observations, the pulsar's birth period is estimated to be shorter than 10 ms.

Tomescu","Graph Operations on Parity Games and Polynomial-Time Algorithms",,,,,"cs.GT cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parity games are games that are played on directed graphs whose vertices are
labeled by natural numbers, called priorities. The players push a token along
the edges of the digraph. The winner is determined by the parity of the
greatest priority occurring infinitely often in this infinite play.
  A motivation for studying parity games comes from the area of formal
verification of systems by model checking. Deciding the winner in a parity game
is polynomial time equivalent to the model checking problem of the modal
mu-calculus. Another strong motivation lies in the fact that the exact
complexity of solving parity games is a long-standing open problem, the
currently best known algorithm being subexponential. It is known that the
problem is in the complexity classes UP and coUP.
  In this paper we identify restricted classes of digraphs where the problem is
solvable in polynomial time, following an approach from structural graph
theory. We consider three standard graph operations: the join of two graphs,
repeated pasting along vertices, and the addition of a vertex. Given a class C
of digraphs on which we can solve parity games in polynomial time, we show that
the same holds for the class obtained from C by applying once any of these
three operations to its elements.
  These results provide, in particular, polynomial time algorithms for parity
games whose underlying graph is an orientation of a complete graph, a complete
bipartite graph, a block graph, or a block-cactus graph. These are classes
where the problem was not known to be efficiently solvable.
  Previous results concerning restricted classes of parity games which are
solvable in polynomial time include classes of bounded tree-width, bounded
DAG-width, and bounded clique-width.
  We also prove that recognising the winning regions of a parity game is not
easier than computing them from scratch.

any such pair is determined by a linear operator on $(\mathfrak{g},[,])$, which
is defined up to adding a derivation. We propose a special fixing of this

root decomposition with respect to a Cartan subalgebra. The classification
leads to two disjoint classes of pairs depending on the symmetry properties of
the corresponding operator with respect to the Killing form. Within each class

15-degree region around NOAA Active Region 11072. We map the
spatio--temporal-power distribution for the different observables and the HMI
Line Core [$I_L$], or Continuum minus Line Depth, and the phase and coherence
functions for selected observable pairs, as a function of position and
frequency. Five-minute oscillation power in all observables is suppressed in
the sunspot and also in plage areas. Above the acoustic cut-off frequency, the
behaviour is more complicated: power in HMI $I_C$ is still suppressed in the
presence of surface magnetic fields, while power in HMI $I_L$ and the AIA bands
is suppressed in areas of surface field but enhanced in an extended area around
the active region, and power in HMI $V$ is enhanced in a narrow zone around
strong-field concentrations and suppressed in a wider surrounding area. The
relative phase of the observables, and their cross-coherence functions, are
also altered around the active region. These effects may help us to understand
the interaction of waves and magnetic fields in the different layers of the
photosphere, and will need to be taken into account in multi-wavelength local
helioseismic analysis of active regions.

systematically above these values. One possibility is that post-retinal
processing significantly contributes to the decrease in the quantum efficiency
determined by signal detection. We carried out experiments in humans using
controlled sources of light while recording EEG and reaction times. Half of the
participants behaved as noisy detectors reporting perception in trials where no
light was sent. DN subjects were significantly faster to take decisions.
Reaction times significantly increased with the decrease in the number of
photons. This trend was reflected in the latency and onset of the EEG responses
over frontal and parietal contacts where the first significant differences in
latency comparable to differences in reaction time appeared. Delays in latency
of neural responses across intensities were observed later over visual areas
suggesting that they are due to the time required to reach the decision
threshold in decision areas rather than to longer integration times at sensory
areas. Our results suggest that post-retinal processing significantly
contribute to increase detection noise and thresholds, decreasing the

emerge at the solar photosphere. Our aim is to investigate the flux emergence

determine the circumstances under which magnetic buoyancy enhances the flux
emergence rate (which is otherwise driven solely by the convective upflows). We
use three-dimensional numerical simulations, solving the equations of
compressible magnetohydrodynamics in a horizontally-periodic Cartesian domain.
A horizontal magnetic flux tube is inserted into fully developed hydrodynamic
convection. We systematically vary the initial field strength, the tube
thickness, the initial entropy distribution along the tube axis and the
magnetic Reynolds number. Focusing upon the low magnetic Prandtl number regime
(Pm<1) at moderate magnetic Reynolds number, we find that the flux tube is
always susceptible to convective disruption to some extent. However, stronger
flux tubes tend to maintain their structure more effectively than weaker ones.
Magnetic buoyancy does enhance the flux emergence rates in the strongest
initial field cases, and this enhancement becomes more pronounced when we
increase the width of the flux tube. This is also the case at higher magnetic
Reynolds numbers, although the flux emergence rates are generally lower in
these less dissipative simulations because the convective disruption of the
flux tube is much more effective in these cases. These simulations seem to be
relatively insensitive to the precise choice of initial conditions: for a given
flow, the evolution of the flux tube is determined primarily by the initial
magnetic field distribution and the magnetic Reynolds number.

applications of biometric technology. One of the main advantage of a biometric
time and attendance system is it avoids ""buddy-punching"". Buddy punching was a
major loophole which will be exploiting in the traditional time attendance
systems. Fingerprint recognition is an established field today, but still
identifying individual from a set of enrolled fingerprints is a time taking
process. Most fingerprint-based biometric systems store the minutiae template
of a user in the database. It has been traditionally assumed that the minutiae
template of a user does not reveal any information about the original
fingerprint. This belief has now been shown to be false; several algorithms
have been proposed that can reconstruct fingerprint images from minutiae
templates. In this paper, a novel fingerprint reconstruction algorithm is
proposed to reconstruct the phase image, which is then converted into the
grayscale image. The proposed reconstruction algorithm reconstructs the phase
image from minutiae. The proposed reconstruction algorithm is used to automate
the whole process of taking attendance, manually which is a laborious and
troublesome work and waste a lot of time, with its managing and maintaining the
records for a period of time is also a burdensome task. The proposed
reconstruction algorithm has been evaluated with respect to the success rates
of type-I attack (match the reconstructed fingerprint against the original
fingerprint) and type-II attack (match the reconstructed fingerprint against
different impressions of the original fingerprint) using a commercial
fingerprint recognition system. Given the reconstructed image from our
algorithm, we show that both types of attacks can be effectively launched

He I lines at 4026, 4388 and 4471 A with vsini. As the sample has been selected
solely on the basis of spectral types it contains an selection of B stars in
the field, in clusters, and in OB associations. The vsini distribution obtained
for the entire sample is found to be essentially flat for vsini values between
0-150 km/s, with only a modest peak at low projected rotational velocities.
Considering subsamples of stars, there appears to be a gradation in the vsini
distribution with the field stars presenting a larger fraction of the slow
rotators and the cluster stars distribution showing an excess of stars with
vsini between 70 and 130 km/s. Furthermore, for a subsample of potential
runaway stars we find that the vsini distribution resembles the distribution
seen in denser environments, which could suggest that these runaway stars have
been subject to dynamical ejection mechanisms.

task execution. In this paper, we address the problem of a planner who needs to
incentivize agents within a network in order to seek their help in executing an
{\em atomic task} as well as in recruiting other agents to execute the task. We
study this mechanism design problem under two natural resource optimization
settings: (1) cost critical tasks, where the planner's goal is to minimize the
total cost, and (2) time critical tasks, where the goal is to minimize the
total time elapsed before the task is executed. We identify a set of desirable
properties that should ideally be satisfied by a crowdsourcing mechanism. In
particular, {\em sybil-proofness} and {\em collapse-proofness} are two
complementary properties in our desiderata. We prove that no mechanism can
satisfy all the desirable properties simultaneously. This leads us naturally to
explore approximate versions of the critical properties. We focus our attention
on approximate sybil-proofness and our exploration leads to a parametrized
family of payment mechanisms which satisfy collapse-proofness. We characterize
the approximate versions of the desirable properties in cost critical and time
critical domain.

formation of an optically-thick envelope scattering the radiation formed in the

optimization and it is used throughout AI. Several local search algorithms are
based on searching the k-exchange neighborhood. This is the set of solutions

elements. As a rule of thumb, the larger k is, the better are the chances of
finding an improved solution. However, for inputs of size n, a na\""ive
brute-force search of the k-exchange neighborhood requires n to the power of
O(k) time, which is not practical even for very small values of k.
  Fellows et al. (IJCAI 2009) studied whether this brute-force search is
avoidable and gave positive and negative answers for several combinatorial
problems. They used the notion of local search in a strict sense. That is, an
improved solution needs to be found in the k-exchange neighborhood even if a
global optimum can be found efficiently.
  In this paper we consider a natural relaxation of local search, called
permissive local search (Marx and Schlotter, IWPEC 2009) and investigate
whether it enhances the domain of tractable inputs. We exemplify this approach
on a fundamental combinatorial problem, Vertex Cover. More precisely, we show
that for a class of inputs, finding an optimum is hard, strict local search is
hard, but permissive local search is tractable.

branchings, that is, polytrees in which the in-degree of every node is at most

  We show that the problem can be solved via a matroid intersection formulation

order of the polynomial time bound depends on this constant, hence the
algorithm does not establish fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by
the number of deleted arcs. We show that a restricted version of the problem

evidence has been interpreted as the spectral signature of dark matter
annihilation or internal bremsstrahlung. Through a combination of supervised

real it might be related to accretion, bubble, or jet activity in nearby (z <

due to a chance occurrence caused by extragalactic background light (EBL)

single exposures is a challenging task, because of the complex signal recorded
by IFS instruments. Existing detection algorithms are commonly found to be
unreliable in the case of IFS data and the optimal parameter settings are
usually unknown a-priori for a given dataset. The CALIFA survey generates
hundreds of IFS datasets for which a reliable and robust detection algorithm
for cosmics is required as an important part of the fully automatic CALIFA data
reduction pipeline. We developed a novel algorithm, PyCosmic, which combines
the edge-detection algorithm of L.A.Cosmic with a point-spread function
convolution scheme. We generated mock data to compute the efficiency of
different algorithms for a wide range of characteristic fibre-fed IFS datasets
using the PMAS and VIMOS IFS instruments as representative cases. PyCosmic is
the only algorithm that achieves an acceptable detection performance for CALIFA
data. We find that PyCosmic is the most robust tool with a detection rate of
>~90% and a false detection rate <5% for any of the tested IFS data. It has one
less free parameter than the L.A.Cosmic algorithm. Only for strongly
undersampled IFS data does L.A.Cosmic exceed the performance of PyCosmic by a
few per cent. DCR never reaches the efficiency of the other two algorithms and
should only be used if computational speed is a concern. Thus, PyCosmic appears
to be the most versatile cosmics detection algorithm for IFS data. It is

First, we study the degraded MAC with confidential messages, where two users
transmit their confidential messages (no common message) to a destination, and
each user obtains a degraded version of the output of the MAC. Each user views
the other user as a eavesdropper, and wishes to keep its confidential message
as secret as possible from the other user. Measuring each user's uncertainty
about the other user's confidential message by equivocation, the inner and
outer bounds on the capacity-equivocation region for this model have been
provided. The result is further explained via the binary and Gaussian examples.
  Second, the discrete memoryless multiple-access wiretap channel (MAC-WT) is
studied, where two users transmit their corresponding confidential messages (no
common message) to a legitimate receiver, while an additional wiretapper wishes
to obtain the messages via a wiretap channel. This new model is considered into
two cases: the general MAC-WT with cooperative encoders, and the degraded
MAC-WT with non-cooperative encoders. The capacity-equivocation region is
totally determined for the cooperative case, and inner and outer bounds on the
capacity-equivocation region are provided for the non-cooperative case. For
both cases, the results are further explained via the binary examples.

function of frequency and in the presence of a finite chemical potential due to
charging. Unlike the monolayer, we find a Drude absorption at charge neutrality
in addition to an interband absorption with onset of twice the interlayer
hopping energy. At finite doping, the interband absorption exhibits two edges
which depend on both chemical potential and interlayer hopping energy. We study
the behaviour as a function of varying chemical potential relative to the
interlayer hopping energy scale and compute the partial optical sum. The
results are contrasted with the previously published case of AB-stacking. While
we focus on in-plane conductivity, we also provide the perpendicular
conductivity for both AB and AA stacking. We also examine conductivity for
other variations with AA-stacking, such as AAA-stacked trilayer. Based on
proposed models for topological insulators discussed in the literature, we also
consider the effect of spin orbit coupling on the optical properties of an
AA-stacked bilayer which illustrates the effect of an energy gap opening at
points in the band structure.

mortality. Therapeutic strategies include synthetic drugs and surgery, which
may entail high costs and serious complications. Plant-based medicinal agents
offer an alternative approach. A review of the studies on accessible botanical
sources for the treatment of obesity is provided, which attempts to explain how
these medicinal plants act to cause weight loss, and which approach is safer
and more efficient. Information was gathered for the period of 1991 to 2012.
Five basic mechanisms, including stimulating thermogenesis, lowering
lipogenesis, enhancing lipolysis, suppressing appetite, and decreasing the
absorption of lipids may be operating. Consumption of standardized medicinal
plant extracts may be a safe treatment for obesity. However, some combinations
of medicinal plants may result in either lower efficacy or cause unexpected
side-effects.

particular, we analyze the importance of the initial distribution of opinions
in determining the asymptotic configuration. Thus, we sketch the structure of
attractors of the dynamical system, by means of the numerical computation of
the time evolution of the agents density. We show that, for a given bound of
confidence, a consensus can be encouraged or prevented by certain initial
conditions. Furthermore, a noisy perturbation is added to the system with the
purpose of modeling the free will of the agents. As a consequence, the
importance of the initial condition is partially replaced by that of the
statistical distribution of the noise. Nevertheless, we still find evidence of
the influence of the initial state upon the final configuration for a short
range of the bound of confidence parameter.

recent decades. Recently, view-based methods have attracted much research
attention due to the high discriminative property of multi-views for 3D object
representation. In this report, we summarize the view-based 3D model methods
and provide the further research trends. This paper focuses on the scheme for
matching between multiple views of 3D models and the application of
bag-of-visual-words method in 3D model retrieval. For matching between multiple
views, the many-to-many matching, probabilistic matching and semisupervised
learning methods are introduced. For bag-of-visual-words application in 3D
model retrieval, we first briefly review the bag-of-visual-words works on
multimedia and computer vision tasks, where the visual dictionary has been
detailed introduced. Then a series of 3D model retrieval methods by using
bag-of-visual-words description are surveyed in this paper. At last, we
summarize the further research content in view-based 3D model retrieval.
