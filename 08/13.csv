  Operators and its Application to Human Oral Bioavailability Prediction",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Very recently new genetic operators, called geometric semantic operators,
have been defined for genetic programming. Contrarily to standard genetic
operators, which are uniquely based on the syntax of the individuals, these new
operators are based on their semantics, meaning with it the set of input-output
pairs on training data. Furthermore, these operators present the interesting
property of inducing a unimodal fitness landscape for every problem that
consists in finding a match between given input and output data (for instance
regression and classification). Nevertheless, the current definition of these
operators has a serious limitation: they impose an exponential growth in the
size of the individuals in the population, so their use is impossible in
practice. This paper is intended to overcome this limitation, presenting a new
genetic programming system that implements geometric semantic operators in an
extremely efficient way. To demonstrate the power of the proposed system, we
use it to solve a complex real-life application in the field of
pharmacokinetic: the prediction of the human oral bioavailability of potential
new drugs. Besides the excellent performances on training data, which were
expected because the fitness landscape is unimodal, we also report an excellent
generalization ability of the proposed system, at least for the studied
application. In fact, it outperforms standard genetic programming and a wide
set of other well-known machine learning methods.

X-ray diffraction analysis. A plausible growth mechanism of such FLG is

a symmetry breaking (pitchfork) bifurcation. Second, the ground state and the

phenomenology is also pairwise identified for higher excited states, with e.g.
the two-soliton structure bearing similar characteristics to the zero-soliton
one, and the three-soliton state having the same pitchfork destabilization

  We construct a matrix A and recovery algorithm with the following properties:
(i) if there are k objects, the number of measurements m is O((k log N)/(log
k)), undercutting the best known bound of O(k log(N/k)) (ii) the matrix A is
very sparse, which is important for hardware implementations of compressive

typically use cameras to acquire an image of the sky, and then identify stars
in the image to compute their orientation. Taking pictures is very expensive

optically compresses the image before it reaches the camera's array of pixels,

of magnitude smaller than current state of the art observational resolution

  Aim. In order to understand coronal heating and interpret correctly
observations it is crucial to study the thermodynamics of such a system where
energy is deposited at unresolved small-scales.
  Methods. Fully compressible three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations
are carried out to understand the thermodynamics of coronal heating in the
magnetically confined solar corona.
  Results. We show that temperature is highly structured at scales below
observational resolution and nonhomogeneously distributed so that only a

qualitatively different possibilities. In the massless case we have a parameter

solitons. For the massive vector meson, besides the no-skyrmion region and a

user queries enables more effective query analysis and retrieval of relevant
products. However, due to lack of sufficient domain knowledge, user queries
often include terms that cannot be mapped directly to any product attribute.
For example, a user looking for {\tt designer handbags} might start with such a
query because she is not familiar with the manufacturers, the price ranges,
and/or the material that gives a handbag designer appeal. Current commerce
search engines treat terms such as {\tt designer} as keywords and attempt to
match them to contents such as product reviews and product descriptions, often
resulting in poor user experience.
  In this study, we propose to address this problem by reformulating queries
involving terms such as {\tt designer}, which we call \emph{modifiers}, to
queries that specify precise product attributes. We learn to rewrite the
modifiers to attribute values by analyzing user behavior and leveraging
structured data sources such as the product catalog that serves the queries. We
first produce a probabilistic mapping between the modifiers and attribute
values based on user behavioral data. These initial associations are then used
to retrieve products from the catalog, over which we infer sets of attribute
values that best describe the semantics of the modifiers. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach based on a comprehensive Mechanical Turk study.
We find that users agree with the attribute values selected by our approach in
about 95% of the cases and they prefer the results surfaced for our
reformulated queries to ones for the original queries in 87% of the time.

challenges in the area of source finding and cataloguing. The data rates and
image sizes are very large, and require automated processing in a
high-performance computing environment. This requires development of new tools,
that are able to operate in such an environment and can reliably handle large
datasets. These tools must also be able to accommodate the different types of
observations ASKAP will make: continuum imaging, spectral-line imaging,
transient imaging. The ASKAP project has developed a source-finder known as
Selavy, built upon the Duchamp source-finder (Whiting 2012). Selavy
incorporates a number of new features, which we describe here.
  Since distributed processing of large images and cubes will be essential, we
describe the algorithms used to distribute the data, find an appropriate
threshold and search to that threshold and form the final source catalogue. We
describe the algorithm used to define a varying threshold that responds to the
local, rather than global, noise conditions, and provide examples of its use.
And we discuss the approach used to apply two-dimensional fits to detected
sources, enabling more accurate parameterisation. These new features are
compared for timing performance, where we show that their impact on the
pipeline processing will be small, providing room for enhanced algorithms.
  We also discuss the development process for ASKAP source finding software. By

examine a non-adiabatic-like accelerated expansion of the universe in entropic

solve the modified Friedmann and acceleration equations, neglecting high-order

and propose a simple model. Through the luminosity distance, it is demonstrated
that the simple model agrees well with both the observed accelerated expansion
of the universe and a fine-tuned standard $\Lambda$CDM (lambda cold dark
matter) model. However, we find that the increase of the entropy for the simple
model is likely uniform, while the increase of the entropy for the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model tends to be gradually slow especially after the present

(VLD) $<\delta \mathcal{L}(\omega) \delta \mathcal{L}(-\omega)>$ in turbulent
flows of quantum fluids. Two cases are considered. The first one is the
counterflowing (Vinen) turbulence, where the vortex lines are disordered, and
the evolution of quantity $\mathcal{L}(t)$ obeys the Vinen equation. The second
case is the quasi-classic turbulence, where vortex lines are believed to form
the so called vortex bundles, and their dynamics is described by the HVBK
equations. The latter case, is of a special interest, since a number of recent
experiments demonstrate the $\omega ^{-5/3}$ dependence for spectrum VLD,
instead of $\omega ^{1/3}$ law, typical for spectrum of vorticity. In
nonstationary situation, in particular, in the fluctuating turbulent flow there
is a retardation between the instantaneous value of the normal velocity and the
quantity $\mathcal{L}$. This retardation tends to decrease in the accordance
with the inner dynamics, which has a relaxation character. In both cases the
relaxation dynamics of VLD is related to fluctuations of the relative velocity,
however if for the Vinen case the rate of temporal change for $\mathcal{L}(t)$
is directly depends on $\delta \mathbf{v}_{ns}$, for the HVBK dynamics it
depends on $\nabla \times \delta \mathbf{v}_{ns}$. As a result, for the
disordered case the spectrum $<\delta \mathcal{L}(\omega) \delta
\mathcal{L}(-\omega)>$ coincides with the spectrum $\omega ^{-5/3} $. In the
case of the bundle arrangement, the spectrum of the VLD varies (at different
temperatures) from $\omega ^{1/3}$ to $\omega ^{-5/3}$ dependencies. This
conclusion may serve as a basis for the experimental determination of what kind
of the turbulence is implemented in different types of generation.

explicitly the equations of the linear scalar perturbations of the FRW universe

equations to a particular gauge, we are able to obtain a master equation of the
perturbations, in contrast to all the other versions of the theory without the
projectability condition. This is because in the current version of the theory
it has the same degree of freedom of general relativity. To calculate the power
spectrum and index, we first define the initial conditions as the ones that
minimize the energy of the ground state. Then, we obtain the full solutions of
the equation of motion, by using the WKB approximations. From these solutions,
we calculate the power spectrum and spectrum index of the comoving curvature
perturbations and find the corrections due to the high order spatial derivative
terms of the theory to those standard results obtained in general relativity.
Remarkably, partly of corrections are a direct consequence of the
non-projectability condition. It is also shown that the perturbations are still
of scale-invariance, and the results obtained in the general covariant

proportionally to Tc^alpha. Within a rather narrow error bar of +-0.15, the
exponent alpha was the same (approximately 2) over a range of compositions
(0.055 < x < 0.15) around the optimal concentration, x=0.08, where Tc is the
maximum in the phase diagram. Thus, whether the superconductivity was
coexistent with magnetism (underdoped) or not (overdoped) did not affect the

stars (NS) could give rise to several interesting phenomena. Compact stars can
have such exotic states up to their surface (called strange stars (SS)) or they
can have quark core surrounded by hadronic matter, known as hybrid stars (HS).
As the state of matter of the resultant SS/HS is different from the initial
hadronic matter, their masses also differ. Therefore, such conversion leads to
huge energy release, sometimes of the order of $10^{53}$ ergs. In the present
work we study the qualitative energy released by such conversion. Recent
observations reveal huge surface magnetic field in certain stars, termed
magnetars. Such huge magnetic fields can modify the equations of state (EOS) of
the matter describing the star. Therefore, the mass of magnetars are different
from normal NS. The energy released during the conversion process from neutron
magnetar (NM) to strange magnetar/hybrid magnetar (SS/HS) is different from
normal NS to SS/HS conversion. In this work we calculate the energy release
during the phase transition in magnetars. The energy released during NS to
SS/HS conversion exceeds the energy released during NM to SM/HM conversion. The
energy released during the conversion of NS to SS is always of the order of
$10^{53}$ ergs. The amount of energy released during such conversion can only
be compared to the energy observed during the gamma ray bursts (GRB). The
energy liberated during NM to HM conversion is few times lesser, and is not
likely to power GRB at cosmological distances. However, the magnetars are more
likely to lose their energy from the magnetic poles and can produce giant
flares, which are usually associated with magnetars.

computation is defined as follows: A database DB of N bits held by Bob is
queried by a user Alice who is interested in the bit DB_b in such a way that
(1) Alice learns DB_b and only DB_b and (2) Bob does not learn anything about
Alice's choice b. While solutions to this problem in the classical domain rely
largely on unproven computational complexity theoretic assumptions, it is also
known that perfect solutions that guarantee both database and user privacy are
impossible in the quantum domain. Jakobi et al. [Phys. Rev. A, 83(2), 022301,
Feb 2011] proposed a protocol for Oblivious Transfer using well known QKD
techniques to establish an Oblivious Key to solve this problem. Their solution
provided a good degree of database and user privacy (using physical principles
like impossibility of perfectly distinguishing non-orthogonal quantum states
and the impossibility of superluminal communication) while being loss-resistant
and implementable with commercial QKD devices (due to the use of SARG04).
However, their Quantum Oblivious Key Distribution (QOKD) protocol requires a
communication complexity of O(N log N). Since modern databases can be extremely
large, it is important to reduce this communication as much as possible. In
this paper, we first suggest a modification of their protocol wherein the
number of qubits that need to be exchanged is reduced to O(N). A subsequent
generalization reduces the quantum communication complexity even further in
such a way that only a few hundred qubits are needed to be transferred even for
very large databases.

develop a distributed solution that relies on a general class of adaptive
diffusion strategies. We show how the diffusion process can be represented as
the cascade composition of three operators: two combination operators and a
gradient descent operator. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we establish
the existence of a unique fixed point for the composite cascade. We then study
how close each agent converges towards this fixed point, and also examine how
close the Pareto solution is to the fixed point. We perform a detailed
mean-square error analysis and establish that all agents are able to converge
to the same Pareto optimal solution within a sufficiently small

address several issues concerning irreducible continuous unitary

any irreducible positive energy representation of $G^\sharp$, i.e., for which

The passage from irreducible unitary representations of $G$ to representations

continuous. To facilitate this verification, we derive various effective
criteria for the continuity of projective unitary representations. Based on
results on Borchers for $W^*$-dynamical systems, we also derive a
characterization of the continuous positive definite functions on $G$ that
extend to a $G^\sharp$.

expected to be a sensitive signal of local strong parity violation. For the
early time we consider fluctuations in the position of charged spectators
resulting in electromagnetic field fluctuations as well as in the position of
participant baryons defining the event plane. For partonic and hadronic phases
in intermediate stages of the interaction we study the possible formation of
excited matter in electric charge dipole and quadrupole form as generated by
fluctuations. The role of the transverse momentum and local charge conservation
laws in the observed azimuthal asymmetry is investigated, too. All these
above-mentioned effects are incorporated in our analysis based on
event-by-event PHSD calculations. Furthermore, the azimuthal angular
correlations from Au+Au collisions observed in the recent STAR measurements
within the RHIC Beam-Energy-Scan (BES) program are studied. It is shown that
the STAR correlation data at the collision energies of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 7.7

the model fails to describe the $\psi$ correlation data resulting in an
overestimation of the partonic scalar field involved. We conclude that an

Black-Scholes model can be constructed with some Markov processes such as
Brownian motion. The advantage of modeling with fBm to Markov proccesses is its
capability of exposing the dependence between returns. The real life data for a
volatile asset display long-range dependence property. For this reason, using
fBm is a more realistic model compared to Markov processes. Investors would be
interested in any kind of information on the risk in order to manage it or
hedge it. The maximum possible loss is one way to measure highest possible

give some theoretical bounds on the distribution of maximum possible loss of

of maximum loss of standard fBm and fBm with drift and diffusion coefficients.
In the investment point of view, these results explain, how large values of

globular clusters, as their presence in a specific category of clusters might
provide more clues as to their formation. We selected from the WISE all-Sky

clusters within 50 kpc, which is the distance to which RCB stars are detectable
by WISE. The total number of stars selected in this way was 635989. We then
successively applied the eight selection criteria of Tisserand (2012) satisfied
by RCB stars to the dereddened photometric WISE and 2MASS data. Only three
stars satisfying the conditions were found in the field of three globular
clusters. The star in the field of Liller 1 is most probably a protostar. For
the two other candidates, the absence of photometry in the visible range did
not allow us to establish their nature with certainty. We further identified
one dust-enshrouded star that only satisfied the first selection criteria, and
used DUSTY to determine that it is a star of temperature 4800K enshrouded in a
dusty envelope with a temperature 300 K and an opacity in the visible of 0.59.
It is probably an Xray binary star with a dusty accretion disk. We found no RCB

systems which does not have a counterpart in non-interacting ones. The optical
absorption spectrum of a system is obtained by shining light on it. At the
microscopic level photons hit the electrons which sit in the ground state and
change their configuration. If the light source is not too intense this can be
described in linear response; that is only ""one photon"" processes are involved,
only one electron per time can be influenced. Here is where the interaction
comes in. The hit electron is linked to the others and so other process take
place, one of these is the appearance of multiple excitations.
  In the second part of the thesis we focus on the application of more standard
techniques to the description of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). In particular we
focus on the effects of magnetic fields on CNTs. CNTs are quasi 1D-systems
composed by carbon atoms which have been discovered in 1952. Under the effect
of a magnetic field electrons delocalized on a cylindrical surface display a
peculiar behaviour, known as Aharonov-Bohm effect. The Aharonov-Bohm is a pure
quantum mechanical effect which does not have any counterpart in classical
physics. In CNTs the Aharonov-Bohm modify the electronic gap and so can be used
to tune the electronic properties. Though a model able to account for such
process is available in the literature, in the present work we will describe
the effect of magnetic fields ""ab-initio"". In the description of CNTs we will
use standard approximations which are by far much more accurate and general
than any approximation introduced in phenomenological descriptions based on

designed to select objects with red MIR power-law spectral energy distributions

in the photometry and deviations of the MIR SEDs from a pure power-law. The
completeness of the MIR selection is a strong function of luminosity. At L(2-10

97.1_{-4.8}^{+2.2}% and 76.5_{-18.4}^{+13.3}% of the BUXS type-1 and type-2 AGN

industrial applications, e.g., stabilisation of emulsions. The dynamics of
fluid-fluid interfaces is difficult to study because these interfaces are
usually deformable and their shapes are not known a priori. Since experiments
do not provide access to all observables of interest, computer simulations pose
attractive alternatives to gain insight into the physics of interfaces. In the
present article, we restrict ourselves to systems with dimensions comparable to
the lateral interface extensions. We provide a critical discussion of three
numerical schemes coupled to the lattice Boltzmann method as a solver for the
hydrodynamics of the problem: (a) the immersed boundary method for the
simulation of vesicles and capsules, the Shan-Chen pseudopotential approach for
multi-component fluids in combination with (b) an additional
advection-diffusion component for surfactant modelling and (c) a molecular
dynamics algorithm for the simulation of nanoparticles acting as emulsifiers.

ingredients: dark matter and dark energy. In this paper, we explore the
possibility that, in fact, there exist two dark-energy components: the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$, with equation-of-state parameter
$w_\Lambda=-1$, and a `missing matter' component $X$ with $w_X=-2/3$, which we
introduce here to allow the evolution of the universal scale factor as a
function of conformal time to exhibit a symmetry that relates the big bang to
the future conformal singularity, such as in Penrose's conformal cyclic
cosmology. Using recent cosmological observations, we constrain the present-day
energy density of missing matter to be $\Omega_{X,0}=-0.034 \pm 0.075$. This is
consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, but constraints on the energy
densities of all the components are considerably broadened by the introduction
of missing matter; significant relative probability exists even for
$\Omega_{X,0} \sim 0.1$, and so the presence of a missing matter component
cannot be ruled out. As a result, a Bayesian model selection analysis only
slightly disfavours its introduction by 1.1 log-units of evidence. Foregoing
our symmetry requirement on the conformal time evolution of the universe, we
extend our analysis by allowing $w_X$ to be a free parameter. For this more
generic `double dark energy' model, we find $w_X = -1.01 \pm 0.16$ and
$\Omega_{X,0} = -0.10 \pm 0.56$, which is again consistent with the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model, although once more the posterior distributions are
sufficiently broad that the existence of a second dark-energy component cannot
be ruled out. The model including the second dark energy component also has an
equivalent Bayesian evidence to $\Lambda$CDM, within the estimation error, and
is indistinguishable according to the Jeffreys guideline.

it is proven that all solutions to the Weyl equations are degenerate, in the
sense that they correspond to an infinite number of electromagnetic

is shown that they can be classified into two classes. The elements of the

degenerate Dirac solutions. Further, it is proven that at least two of these
4-potentials are gauge-inequivalent, corresponding to different electromagnetic
fields. In order to illustrate this particularly important result we have
studied the denerate solutions to the force-free Dirac equation and shown that
they correspond to massless particles. We have also provided explicit examples

group $Mp_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, which is the unique non-trivial double cover of
$SL_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, admits a representation $\rho_{M}$, called the Weil
representation, on the space $\mathbb{C}[M^{*}/M]$. The main aim of this paper
is to show how the formulae for the $\rho_{M}$-action of a general element of
$Mp_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ can be obtained by a direct evaluation which does not
depend on ``external objects'' such as theta functions. We decompose the Weil
representation $\rho_{M}$ into $p$-parts, in which each $p$-part can be seen as
subspace of the Schwartz functions on the $p$-adic vector space
$M_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$. Then we consider the Weil representation of
$Mp_{2}(\mathbb{Q}_{p})$ on the space of Schwartz functions on
$M_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}}$, and see that restricting to $Mp_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ just
gives the $p$-part of $\rho_{M}$ again. The operators attained by the Weil
representation are not always those appearing in the formulae from 1964, but
are rather their multiples by certain roots of unity. For this, one has to find
which pair of elements, lying over a matrix in $SL_{2}(\mathbb{Q}_{p})$, belong
to the metaplectic double cover. Some other properties are also investigated.

to measure the importance of each variable in the model by making use of

Using concepts and results from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces

to a minimization problem which can be provably solved by an iterative
procedure. The consistency properties of the obtained estimator are studied
both in terms of prediction and selection performance. An extensive empirical

changing the plasma process parameters. The amount of H$_2$O$_2$ produced was

coating mechanism does not significantly change the surface BET area and pore

constructing ultrafilters whose ultrapowers have a precise degree of
saturation. We begin by showing that any flexible regular ultrafilter makes the
product of an unbounded sequence of finite cardinals large, {thus} saturating
any stable theory. We then prove directly that a ""bottleneck"" in the inductive
construction of a regular ultrafilter on $\lambda$ (i.e. a point after which
all antichains of $P(\lambda)/D$ have cardinality less than $\lambda$)
essentially prevents any subsequent ultrafilter from being flexible, {thus}
from saturating any non-low theory. The paper's three main constructions are as
follows. First, we construct a regular filter $D$ on $\lambda$ so that any
ultrafilter extending $D$ fails to $\lambda^+$-saturate ultrapowers of the
random graph, {thus} of any unstable theory. The proof constructs the omitted
random graph type directly. Second, assuming existence of a measurable cardinal
$\kappa$, we construct a regular ultrafilter on $\lambda > \kappa$ which is
$\lambda$-flexible but not $\kappa^{++}$-good, improving our previous answer to
a question raised in Dow 1975. Third, assuming a weakly compact cardinal
$\kappa$, we construct an ultrafilter to show that $\lcf(\aleph_0)$ may be
small while all symmetric cuts of cofinality $\kappa$ are realized. Thus
certain families of pre-cuts may be realized while still failing to saturate

within the framework of the local complex potential model, by using potentials
energies and widths optimized in order to reproduce the experimental cross

an infinite population subject to a 3-strategy game. We argue that this
dynamics represents a characterization of how certain systems, both natural and
artificial, are governed. In each period, the population is randomly sorted
into pairs, which engage in a once-off play of the game; the probability that a
member propagates its type to its offspring is proportional only to its payoff
within the pair. We show that if a type is dominant (obtains higher payoffs in
games with both other types), its 'pure' population state, comprising only
members of that type, is globally attracting. If there is no dominant type,
there is an unstable 'mixed' fixed point; the population state eventually
oscillates between the three near-pure states. We then allow for mutations,
where offspring have a non-zero probability of randomly changing their type. In
this case, the existence of a dominant type renders a point near its pure state
globally attracting. If no dominant type exists, a supercritical Hopf
bifurcation occurs at the unique mixed fixed point, and above a critical
(typically low) mutation rate, this fixed point becomes globally attracting:
the implication is that even very low mutation rates can stabilize a system
that would, in the absence of mutations, be unstable.

continuum to avoid the bias introduced by continuum fitting over the Ly-alpha

previous measurements of the mean Ly-alpha transmission. The individual spectra
are first combined into twenty-six composites with mean redshifts spanning 2.25
< z_comp < 5.08. The flux ratios of separate composites at the same rest
wavelength are then used, without continuum fitting, to infer the mean
transmitted flux, F(z), as a fraction of its value at z~2. Absolute values for
F(z) are found by scaling our relative values to measurements made from
high-resolution data by Faucher-Giguere et al. (2008) at z < 2.5, where
continuum uncertainties are minimal. We find that F(z) evolves smoothly with
redshift, with no evidence of a previously reported feature at z~3.2. This
trend is consistent with a gradual evolution of the ionization and thermal
state of the intergalactic medium over 2 < z < 5. Our results generally agree
with the most careful measurements to date made from high-resolution data, but
offer much greater precision and extend to higher redshifts. This work also
improves upon previous efforts using SDSS spectra by significantly reducing the
level of systematic error.

This is supported by the analysis of correlation functions of both the module

quark anti-quark ($Q-\bar Q$) pair with the medium can be recast into an
in-medium potential, I solve the time dependent Schr\""odinger equation to
evolve the density matrix which describes the hard pair production and its
connection to the final distribution of hadrons after the medium disappears.
For those temperatures in which bound states survive in the medium, I find a
non-trivial dependence of the production of excited quarkonia states on the
in-medium levels, due to the mixing of vacuum and in-medium wave functions.
This mixing leads, in particular, to the enhancement of the relative abundance
of 2S to 1S states for those systems in which the in-medium ground state of the
$Q-\bar Q$ system is dissolved or close to threshold. I also explore quarkonia
production in a non-homogeneous expanding medium and find that the finite

behavior of $\sqrt{-M(T)}\sim(T-Ta)^m$, where m is an exponent and Ta an
apparent temperature transition. Values of m deviates from the expected mean
field value, 1/2, suggesting the importance of phase fluctuations. Resulting
values of Ta, interpreted as the onset of phase correlations, decrease as field
increases showing an upward curvature. Values of Tc(H) are obtained through a

timed computer controlled events. A distributed GUI-based control system
designed with such experiments in mind, The Cicero Word Generator, is
described. The system makes use of a client-server separation between a user
interface for sequence design and a set of output hardware servers. Output
hardware servers are designed to use standard National Instruments output
cards, but the client-server nature allows this to be extended to other output
hardware. Output sequences running on multiple servers and output cards can be
synchronized using a shared clock. By using an FPGA-generated variable
frequency clock, redundant buffers can be dramatically shortened, and a time
resolution of 100ns achieved over effectively arbitrary sequence lengths.

not uniquely determine the evolution of spacetime structure because quantum

equilibrium (in close analogy to Classical Mechanics) has been associated to
the Hardy-Weinberg (HW) Principle and the identification of equilibrium is
currently assumed by stating that the HW axioms are valid if appropriate values
of Chi-Square (p<0.05) are observed in experiments. Here we show by numerical
experiments with the genetic system of one locus/two alleles that considering
large ensembles of populations the Chi-Square test is not decisive and may lead
to false negatives in random mating populations and false positives in
nonrandom mating populations. As a result we confirm the logical statement that
statistical tests can not be used to deduce if the genetic population is under
the HW conditions. Furthermore, we show that under the HW conditions
populations of any finite size evolve in time according to what can be
identified as neutral dynamics to which the very notion of equilibrium is
unattainable for any practical purpose. Therefore, under the HW conditions
equilibrium properties are not observable. We also show that by relaxing the
condition of random mating the dynamics acquires all the characteristics of
asymptotic stable equilibrium. As a consequence our results show that the
question of equilibrium in genetic systems should be approached in close
analogy to non-equilibrium statistical physics and its observability should be
focused on dynamical quantities like the typical decay properties of the
allelic auto correlation function in time. In this perspective one should
abandon the classical notion of genetic equilibrium and its relation to the HW
proportions and open investigations in the direction of searching for unifying
general principles of population genetic transformations capable to take in
consideration these systems in their full complexity.

theory remains perturbability. By studying the flavour violation process \mu
\rightarrow e \gamma and relic density abundance, we get very strong constraint
for the model. In addition, we try to explain muon anomaly a_{\mu} \equiv
(g-2)/2 within the model, but the contribution induced by new particles is too
small to account for the discrepancy. In WDM scenario, We show that relic
abundance can be produced by thermal production with subsequent entropy
dilution process. The entropy dilution can be attained by N_2 decay in which a
