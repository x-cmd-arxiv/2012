cosmological studies, we must understand how the resonant scattering affects
the escape fraction of the Lya photons. Thus, high spatial resolution
multiwavelength studies of nearby Lya emitters, like Haro 2, are highly needed.
For that purpose, we have used Chandra X-ray and HST (UV, optical and NIR)
images of Haro 2, and STIS and ground-based spectral images along its major and
minor axes, to characterize the Lya emission and the properties of the stellar
population. The UV, Ha (Halpha) and FIR luminosities of the Haro 2 nuclear
starburst are reproduced using evolutionary synthesis models assuming a young
stellar population with ages ~3.5-5.0 Myr, affected by differential
interstellar extinctions. The observed X-ray emission is attributed to gas
heated by the mechanical energy released by the starburst (soft component) and
a Ultra-Luminous X-ray source candidate (hard). Both compact and diffuse Lya
components are observed. Whereas Lya is spatially decoupled from Balmer lines
emission, Balmer decrement and UV continuum, the diffuse Lya component is
spatially correlated with the diffuse soft X-ray emission. Moreover, unlike the
compact one, diffuse Lya shows luminosities larger than predicted from Ha,
assuming case B recombination and dust extinction as derived from Ha/Hbeta. We
propose that, whereas the compact Lya emission is associated to the massive
stellar clusters and is affected by outflows and dust extinction, the diffuse
Lya originates in gas ionized by the hot plasma responsible for the soft X-ray
radiation, as suggested by their spatial correlation and by the measured
L(Ha)/LsoftX ratios. Calibration of Lya as star formation rate tracer should
therefore include both effects (destruction vs. enhancement) to avoid biases in
the study of galaxies at cosmological distances.

model is considered for a thin TiO_2 film containing a region which is highly
self-doped with oxygen vacancies and a region which is less doped, i.e., a
single-phase material with a built-in chemical inhomogeneity sandwiched between
two platinum electrodes. On base of the proposed model, Strukov et al. [1] were
able to obtain the characteristic dynamical state equation and current-voltage

electrochemistry have been overlooked by the authors while putting forward
their model, namely the coupling of diffusion currents at the boundary between
both regions. The device will operate for a certain time like a ""chemical

essential requirement on a genuine memristor, the so-called ""no energy

HP-memristor device must fail as this relation violates by itself Landauer's
principle of the minimum energy costs for information processing. Maybe, such
an approach might be upheld if one introduces an additional prerequisite by
specifying the minimum amount of electric power input to the device which is
required to continuously change internal, physical states of the considered
system. However, we have reasonable doubts with regard to this.

typically a few tens of km/s for both galaxies and quasars, with a significant

underestimated by a factor of 1.19 to 1.34 for galaxies, and by a factor of 2

calculations have been done using event-by-event hydrodynamics where the
initial density profile fluctuates from event to event. In these event-by-event
calculations the expansion rate fluctuates strongly as well, and thus it is
interesting to check how the dynamical freeze-out changes hadron distributions
with respect to the constant temperature freeze-out. We present hadron spectra

show the differences between constant temperature and dynamical freeze-out

plays a role in explaining the lower 17O/18O ratio of the Sun, relative to the
present-day interstellar medium, or the existence of distinct 16O-rich and
16O-poor reservoirs in the Solar System. Although the production of both 17O
and 18O are related to the metallicity of progenitor stars, 17O is most likely
produced in stars that evolve on longer timescales than those that produce 18O.
Therefore the 17O/18O ratio need not have remained constant over time, contrary
to preconceptions and the simplest models of GCE. An apparent linear, slope-one
correlation between delta17O and delta18O in the ISM need not necessarily
reflect an O isotopic gradient, and any slope-one galactocentric gradient need
not correspond to evolution in time. Instead, increasing 17O/18O is consistent
both with observational data from molecular clouds and with modeling of the
compositions of presolar grains. Models in which the rate of star formation has
decelerated over the past few Gyr or in which an enhanced period of star
formation occurred shortly before solar birth (""starburst"") can explain the
solar-ISM O-isotopic difference without requiring a local input of supernova
ejecta into the protosolar cloud. ""Cosmic chemical memory"" models in which
interstellar dust is on average older than interstellar gas predict that
primordial Solar System solids should be 16O-rich, relative to the Sun, in
conflict with observations. However, scenarios in which the 16O-rich
contribution of very massive stars could lead to 16O-poor solids and a 16O-rich
bulk Sun, if the Solar System formed shortly after a starburst, independent of
the popular scenario of photochemical self-shielding of CO.

induces a root system of rank 4. Via the Cartan-Dieudonn\'e theorem, an even
number of successive Coxeter reflections yields rotations that in a Clifford
algebra framework are described by spinors. In three dimensions these spinors
themselves have a natural four-dimensional Euclidean structure, and discrete
spinor groups can therefore be interpreted as 4D polytopes. In fact, we show
that these polytopes have to be root systems, thereby inducing Coxeter groups
of rank 4, and that their automorphism groups include two factors of the
respective discrete spinor groups trivially acting on the left and on the right
by spinor multiplication. Special cases of this general theorem include the
exceptional 4D groups $D_4$, $F_4$ and $H_4$, which therefore opens up a new
understanding of applications of these structures in terms of spinorial
geometry. In particular, 4D groups are ubiquitous in high energy physics. For
the corresponding case in two dimensions, the groups $I_2(n)$ are shown to be
self-dual, whilst via a similar construction in terms of octonions each rank-3
root system induces a root system in dimension 8; this root system is in fact
the direct sum of two copies of the corresponding induced 4D root system.

show that the system presents from the viewpoint of their geometric phases, two
behaviours. The first one is identical to the behaviour of an isolated spin
driven by a magnetic field, as the problem originally treated by Berry. The
second one is specific to the decoherence process. The gauge structures induced
by these geometric phases are then similar to a magnetic monopole gauge
structure for the first case, and can be viewed as a kind of instanton gauge
structure for the second case. We study the role of these geometric phases in
the evolution of a mixed state, particularly by focusing on the evolution of
the density matrix coherence. We investigate also the relation between the
geometric phase of the mixed state of one of the entangled systems and the
geometric phase of the bipartite system.

However, flares having a circular ribbon have rarely been reported, although it
is expected in the fan--spine magnetic topology involving reconnection at a
three-dimensional (3D) coronal null point. We present five circular ribbon
flares with associated surges, using high-resolution and high-cadence halpha
blue wing observations obtained from the recently digitized films of Big Bear
Solar Observatory. In all the events, a central parasitic magnetic field is
encompassed by the opposite polarity, forming a circular PIL traced by filament
material. Consequently, a flare kernel at the center is surrounded by a
circular flare ribbon. The four homologous jet-related flares on 1991 March 17
and 18 are of particular interest, as (1) the circular ribbons brighten
sequentially, with co-spatial surges, rather than simultaneously, (2) the
central flare kernels show an intriguing ""round-trip"" motion and become
elongated, and (3) remote brightenings occur at a region with the same magnetic
polarity as the central parasitic field and are co-temporal with a separate
phase of flare emissions. In another flare on 1991 February 25, the circular
flare emission and surge activity occur successively, and the event could be
associated with magnetic flux cancellation across the circular PIL. We discuss
the implications of these observations combining circular flare ribbons,
homologous jets, and remote brightenings for understanding the dynamics of 3D

on the results of recent, 2.5D axi-symmetric simulations. Our formulation of
the disc wind problem is in the spirit of the original Parker (1958) and Bondi
(1952) problems, namely we assume an elementary flow configuration consisting
of an outflow following pre-defined trajectories in the presence of a central
gravitating point mass. Viscosity and heat conduction are neglected. We
consider two different streamline geometries, both comprised of straight lines
in the (x,z)-plane: (i) streamlines that converge to a geometric point located
at (x,z)=(0,-d) and (ii) streamlines that emerge at a constant inclination
angle from the disc midplane (the x-axis, as we consider geometrically thin
accretion discs). The former geometry is commonly used in kinematic models to
compute synthetic spectra, while the latter, which exhibits self-similarity, is
likely unused for this purpose, although it easily can be with existing
kinematic models. We make the case that it should be, i.e. that geometry (ii)
leads to transonic wind solutions with substantially different properties owing
to its lack of streamline divergence. Both geometries can be used to complement
recent efforts to estimate photoevaporative mass loss rates from protoplanetary
discs. Pertinent to understanding our disc wind results, which are also
applicable to X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei, is a focused
discussion on lesser known properties of classic Parker wind solutions. We find
that the parameter space corresponding to decelerating Parker wind solutions is
made larger due to rotation and leads instead to disc wind solutions that
always accelerate after the bulk velocity is slowed to a minimum value.
Surprisingly, Keplerian rotation may allow for two different transonic wind
solutions for the same physical conditions.

descriptions have been proposed which make quantitative predictions about the

generate a large number of independent, jammed, two-dimensional configurations.
Each configuration consists of a single layer of photoelastic disks supported
by a gentle layer of air. New configurations are generated by alternately
dilating and re-compacting the system through a series of boundary
displacements. Within each configuration, a bath of particles surrounds a
smaller subsystem of particles with a different inter-particle friction
coefficient than the bath. The use of photoelastic particles permits us to find
all particle positions as well as the vector forces at each inter-particle
contact. By comparing the temperature-like quantities in both systems, we find
compactivity (conjugate to the volume) does not equilibrate between the
systems, while the angoricity (conjugate to the stress) does. Both independent
components of the angoricity are linearly dependent on the hydrostatic
pressure, in agreement with predictions of the stress ensemble.

study of galaxy formation simulations of an L* galaxy that uses early stellar
feedback combined with supernova feedback to match the stellar mass--halo mass
relationship. While supernova feedback alone can reduce star formation enough
to match the stellar mass--halo mass relationship, the galaxy forms too many
stars before z=2 to match the evolution seen using abundance matching. Our
early stellar feedback is purely thermal and thus operates like a UV ionization
source as well as providing some additional pressure from the radiation of
massive, young stars. The early feedback heats gas to >10^6 K before cooling to
10^4 K. The pressure from this hot gas creates a more extended disk and
prevents more star formation prior to z=1 than supernovae feedback alone. The
resulting disk galaxy has a flat rotation curve, an exponential surface
brightness profile, and matches a wide range of disk scaling relationships. The
disk forms from the inside-out with an increasing exponential scale length as
the galaxy evolves. Overall, early stellar feedback helps to simulate galaxies
that match observational results at low and high redshifts.

analytic scheme is developed prescribing the coupling of infall from the
intergalactic medium and radial flows within the disc based on angular momentum
conservation. We show that model parameters are tightly constrained by the
observed [Fe/H]-abundance gradient in the Galactic disc. By this comparison the
average rotational velocity of the onfalling material can be constrained to 0.7
< v/V_c < 0.75, or respectively ~ 160 km/s when assuming a constant disc
circular velocity of V_c = 220 km/s. We test the robustness of this value
against the influence of other processes. For a very simple model of inside-out
formation this value changes only by \Delta v/V_c ~ 0.1, i.e. ~ 20 km/s, and
significantly less on more realistic scenarios, showing that inside-out
formation does not alone explain the abundance gradient. Effects of other
uncertain parameters, e.g. star formation history and star formation efficiency
have very small impact.
  Other drivers of inflow beyond our explicit modelling are assessed by adding
a fixed inflow across the whole disc. The churning amplitude only mildly
affects the results mostly by slightly flattening the metallicity gradient in
the inner disc. A new process causing radial gas flows due to the ejection of
material by stars moving on non-circular orbits is studied and seems to
contribute negligibly to the total flows. We further show that gaseous outer
discs cannot be the main source feeding the persistent star formation in the

strong periodic variability at 11.82 s is clearly detected in the Chandra data,
confirming the pulsating nature of the source, with the lightcurve softening at

10^{23} cm^{-2}, and photon index \Gamma = 0.4+/-0.1) with an average absorbed
2-8 keV flux of 1.4\times 10^{-11} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. At the Chandra-based
position, a source is detected in our near infrared (NIR) maps with K_s =
13.14+/-0.04 mag, H_n = 16+/-0.1 mag, and no J_n band counterpart down to ~18
mag. The NIR source, compatible with 2MASS J18175218-1621316, shows no
variability between 2012 March 13 and March 26. Searches of the UKIDSS database
show similar NIR flux levels at epochs six months prior to and after a 2007
February 11 archival Chandra observation where the source's X-ray flux was at
least 87 times fainter. In many ways IGR J18179-1621 is unusual: its
combination of a several week long outburst (without evidence of repeated
outbursts in the historical record), high absorption column (a large fraction
of which is likely local to the system), and 11.82 s period does not fit neatly
into existing X-ray binary categories.

compare three WDM models with a dark matter mass of 0.5, 0.75 and 2.0 keV, with
the standard Cold Dark Matter case. For a fixed set of parameters describing
the baryonic physics the WDM models predict less galaxies at low (stellar)
masses, as expected due to the suppression of power on small scales, while no
substantial difference is found at the high mass end. However these differences

possible to break this degeneracy between DM properties and the
parameterization of baryonic physics by combining observations on the stellar
mass function with the Tully-Fisher relation (the relation between stellar mass
and the rotation velocity at large galactic radii as probed by resolved HI
rotation curves). WDM models with a too warm candidate (m<0.75 keV) cannot
simultaneously reproduce the stellar mass function and the Tully-Fisher

long wavelength (chiral) fermionic states moving independently. We use several
nonperturbative techniques to demonstrate that. First, we analyze the fermionic
spectrum in the deconfinement phase (Tc < T < 2 Tc) using lattice (overlap)
fermions and observe a gap between near-zero modes and the bulk of the
spectrum. Second, we use the bosonization procedure with a finite cut-off and
obtain a dynamical axion-like field out of the chiral fermionic modes. Third,
we use relativistic hydrodynamics for macroscopic description of the effective
theory obtained after the bosonization. Finally, solving the hydrodynamic
equations in gradient expansion, we find that in the presence of external
electromagnetic fields the motion of the ""superfluid"" component gives rise to
the chiral magnetic, chiral electric and dipole wave effects. Latter two
effects are specific for a two-component fluid, which provides us with crucial
experimental tests of the model.

the non-perturbative running of the axion-photon coupling and the mass of the

anomalous dimensions. As a consequence, momentum-independent axion
self-interactions are not induced by photon fluctuations. The non-perturbative
flow towards the ultraviolet exhibits a Landau-pole-type behavior, implying
that the system has a scale of maximum UV extension and that the renormalized
axion-photon coupling in the deep infrared is bounded from above. Even though
gauge invariance guarantees that photon fluctuations do not decouple in the
infrared, the renormalized couplings remain finite even in the deep infrared

existence of an exceptional RG trajectory, which is extendable to arbitrarily

In bulk cuprates such as \LCO{}, the presence of a weak interlayer coupling
stabilizes 3D N\'{e}el order up to high temperatures. In a truly 2D system
however, thermal spin fluctuations melt long range order at any finite
temperature \cite{Mermin1966}. Further, quantum spin fluctuations transfer
magnetic spectral weight out of a well-defined magnon excitation into a
magnetic continuum, the nature of which remains controversial
\cite{Sandvik2001,Ho2001,Christensen2007,Headings2010}. Here, we measure the
spin response of \emph{isolated one-unit-cell thick layers} of \LCO{}. We show
that coherent magnons persist even in a single layer of \LCO{} despite the loss
of magnetic order, with no evidence for resonating valence bond (RVB)-like spin
correlations \cite{Anderson1987,Hsu1990,Christensen2007}. Thus these
excitations are well described by linear spin wave theory (LSWT). We also
observe a high-energy magnetic continuum in the isotropic magnetic response.

scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the clustering of matter over a
larger volume than the combined efforts of all previous spectroscopic surveys
of large scale structure. BOSS uses 1.5 million luminous galaxies as faint as
i=19.9 over 10,000 square degrees to measure BAO to redshifts z<0.7.
Observations of neutral hydrogen in the Lyman alpha forest in more than 150,000
quasar spectra (g<22) will constrain BAO over the redshift range 2.15<z<3.5.
Early results from BOSS include the first detection of the large-scale
three-dimensional clustering of the Lyman alpha forest and a strong detection
from the Data Release 9 data set of the BAO in the clustering of massive
galaxies at an effective redshift z = 0.57. We project that BOSS will yield
measurements of the angular diameter distance D_A to an accuracy of 1.0% at
redshifts z=0.3 and z=0.57 and measurements of H(z) to 1.8% and 1.7% at the
same redshifts. Forecasts for Lyman alpha forest constraints predict a
measurement of an overall dilation factor that scales the highly degenerate
D_A(z) and H^{-1}(z) parameters to an accuracy of 1.9% at z~2.5 when the survey
is complete. Here, we provide an overview of the selection of spectroscopic
targets, planning of observations, and analysis of data and data quality of
BOSS.

this limitation. In particular, based on a combination between an entropic

a DIQKD protocol where the CHSH test is carried out entirely in Alice's
laboratory. Thus the loophole caused by channel losses is avoided.

bipartite graph K_{m,n} in which one designated vertex is a sink. We present a
bijection from these recurrent configurations to decorated parallelogram
polyominoes whose bounding box is a m*n rectangle. Several special types of
recurrent configurations and their properties via this bijection are examined.
For example, recurrent configurations whose sum of heights is minimal are shown
to correspond to polyominoes of least area. Two other classes of recurrent
configurations are shown to be related to bicomposition matrices, a matrix
analogue of set partitions, and (2+2)-free partially ordered sets.
  A canonical toppling process for recurrent configurations gives rise to a
path within the associated parallelogram polyominoes. This path bounces off the
external edges of the polyomino, and is reminiscent of Haglund's well-known
bounce statistic for Dyck paths. We define a collection of polynomials that we
call q,t-Narayana polynomials, defined to be the generating function of the
bistatistic (area,parabounce) on the set of parallelogram polyominoes, akin to
the (area,hagbounce) bistatistic defined on Dyck paths in Haglund (2003). In
doing so, we have extended a bistatistic of Egge, Haglund, Kremer and
Killpatrick (2003) to the set of parallelogram polyominoes. This is one answer
to their question concerning extensions to other combinatorial objects.
  We conjecture the q,t-Narayana polynomials to be symmetric and prove this
conjecture for numerous special cases. We also show a relationship between
Haglund's (area,hagbounce) statistic on Dyck paths, and our bistatistic
(area,parabounce) on a sub-collection of those parallelogram polyominoes living
in a (n+1)*n rectangle.

mechanical signals propagate back to the middle ear, from which they are
emitted as sound. Here we combine theoretical and experimental studies to show
that mechanical signals can be transmitted by waves on Reissner's membrane, an
elastic structure within the cochea. We develop a theory for wave propagation
on Reissner's membrane and its role in otoacoustic emissions. Employing a
scanning laser interferometer, we measure traveling waves on Reissner's

two pieces: a covariant Laplacian and a curvature dependent potential term. By
analogy with elementary magnetic systems they lead to, respectively, dia- and
paramagnetic-type interactions of the metric fluctuations with the background
gravitational field. We show that above 3 spacetime dimensions the
gravitational antiscreening occurring in QEG is entirely due to a strong
dominance of the ultralocal paramagnetic interactions over the diamagnetic ones
that favor screening. (Below 3 dimensions both the dia- and paramagnetic
effects support antiscreening.) The spacetimes of QEG are interpreted as a
polarizable medium with a ""paramagnetic"" response to external perturbations,
and similarities with the vacuum state of Yang-Mills theory are pointed out. As
a by-product, we resolve a longstanding puzzle concerning the beta function of

function of pulse phase from the distribution of visibility on the
Mopra-Tidbinbilla baseline. As we demonstrate, in the presence of strong
scintillation, finite size of the emission region produces a characteristic
W-shaped signature in the projection of the visibility distribution onto the
real axis. This modification involves heightened probability density near the
mean amplitude, decreased probability to either side, and a return to the
zero-size distribution beyond. We observe this signature with high statistical
significance, as compared with the best-fitting zero-size model, in many
regions of pulse phase. We find that the equivalent full width at half maximum
of the pulsar's emission region decreases from more than 400 km early in the
pulse to near zero at the peak of the pulse, and then increases again to
approximately 800 km near the trailing edge. We discuss possible systematic
effects, and compare our work with previous results.

range of methods to produce cold molecular ensembles. However, cooling
polyatomic molecules to ultracold temperatures has until now seemed
intractable. Here we report on the experimental realization of opto-electrical
cooling, a paradigm-changing cooling and accumulation method for polar
molecules. Its key attribute is the removal of a large fraction of a molecule's
kinetic energy in each step of the cooling cycle via a Sisyphus effect,
allowing cooling with only few dissipative decay processes. We demonstrate its
potential by reducing the temperature of about 10^6 trapped CH_3F molecules by
a factor of 13.5, with the phase-space density increased by a factor of 29 or a
factor of 70 discounting trap losses. In contrast to other cooling mechanisms,
our scheme proceeds in a trap, cools in all three dimensions, and works for a
large variety of polar molecules. With no fundamental temperature limit
anticipated down to the photon-recoil temperature in the nanokelvin range, our
method eliminates the primary hurdle in producing ultracold polyatomic
molecules. The low temperatures, large molecule numbers and long trapping times
up to 27 s will allow an interaction-dominated regime to be attained, enabling
collision studies and investigation of evaporative cooling toward a BEC of
polyatomic molecules.

of data (11 TB for the 148 GHz band only), with a daily average of 10.5 hours

devoted to a 280 deg^2 stripe (4.5 hours by 4.8 deg) centered at the celestial

telescope pointing, and data selection. Out of 1260 survey hours and 1024
detectors per array, 816 hours and 593 effective detectors remain after data
selection for this frequency band, yielding a 38% survey efficiency. The total
sensitivity in 2008, determined from the noise level between 5 Hz and 20 Hz in
the time-ordered data stream (TOD), is 32 micro-Kelvin sqrt{s} in CMB units.
Atmospheric brightness fluctuations constitute the main contaminant in the data

points and n circles in three dimensions. The previous best known bound,
originally established for the planar case and later extended to any dimension
$\ge 2$, is $O*(m^{2/3}n^{2/3} + m^{6/11}n^{9/11}+m+n)$, where the $O*(\cdot)$
notation hides sub-polynomial factors. Since all the points and circles may lie
on a common plane (or sphere), it is impossible to improve the bound in R^3
without first improving it in the plane.
  Nevertheless, we show that if the set of circles is required to be ""truly
three-dimensional"" in the sense that no sphere or plane contains more than $q$
of the circles, for some $q << n$, then the bound can be improved to
\[O*(m^{3/7}n^{6/7} + m^{2/3}n^{1/2}q^{1/6} + m^{6/11}n^{15/22}q^{3/22} + m +
n). \]
  For various ranges of parameters (e.g., when $m=\Theta(n)$ and $q =
o(n^{7/9})$), this bound is smaller than the lower bound
$\Omega*(m^{2/3}n^{2/3}+m+n)$, which holds in two dimensions.
  We present several extensions and applications of the new bound: (i) For the
special case where all the circles have the same radius, we obtain the improved
bound $O*(m^{5/11}n^{9/11} + m^{2/3}n^{1/2}q^{1/6} + m + n$. (ii) We present an
improved analysis that removes the subpolynomial factors from the bound when
$m=O(n^{3/2-\eps})$ for any fixed $\varepsilon >0$. (iii) We use our results to
obtain the improved bound $O(m^{15/7})$ for the number of mutually similar
triangles determined by any set of $m$ points in R^3.
  Our result is obtained by applying the polynomial partitioning technique of
Guth and Katz using a constant-degree partitioning polynomial (as was also
recently used by Solymosi and Tao). We also rely on various additional tools
from analytic, algebraic, and combinatorial geometry.

variety of physical phenomena, the construction of an optimal control of such

scheduling. In this paper, we devise an algorithm for the computation of an
optimal control of constrained nonlinear switched dynamical systems. The
control parameter for such systems include a continuous-valued input and
discrete-valued input, where the latter corresponds to the mode of the switched
system that is active at a particular instance in time. Our approach, which we
prove converges to local minimizers of the constrained optimal control problem,
first relaxes the discrete-valued input, then performs traditional optimal
control, and then projects the constructed relaxed discrete-valued input back
to a pure discrete-valued input by employing an extension to the classical
Chattering Lemma that we prove. We extend this algorithm by formulating a
computationally implementable algorithm which works by discretizing the time
interval over which the switched dynamical system is defined. Importantly, we
prove that this implementable algorithm constructs a sequence of points by
recursive application that converge to the local minimizers of the original
constrained optimal control problem. Four simulation experiments are included
to validate the theoretical developments.

sciences where either the dynamic is nonlinear and/or the probability density
function of uncertain state is non-Gaussian. In such problems, the accuracy of
the estimated quantities depends highly upon how accurately their posterior pdf
can be approximated. In low dimensional state spaces, methods based on
Sequential Importance Sampling (SIS) can suitably approximate the posterior
pdf. For higher dimensional problems, however, these techniques are usually
inappropriate since the required number of particles to achieve satisfactory
estimates grows exponentially with the dimension of state space. On the other
hand, ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and its variants are more suitable for
large-scale problems due to transformation of particles in the Bayesian update
step. It has been shown that the latter class of methods may lead to suboptimal
solutions for strongly nonlinear problems due to the Gaussian assumption in the
update step. In this paper, we introduce a new technique based on the Gaussian
sum expansion which captures the non-Gaussian features more accurately while
the required computational effort remains within reason for high dimensional
problems. We demonstrate the performance of the method for non-Gaussian
processes through several examples including the strongly nonlinear Lorenz
models. Results show a remarkable improvement in the mean square error compared
to EnKF, and a desirable convergence behavior as the number of particles
increases.

practical considerations of data analysis, I consider E/B-mode estimators which
are linear combinations of the binned shear correlation function data points. I
demonstrate that these estimators mix E- and B-modes generally. I then show how
to define estimators which minimize this E/B-mode mixing and give practical
recipes for their construction and use. Using these optimal estimators, I
demonstrate that the vector space composed of the binned shear correlation
function data points can be decomposed into approximately ambiguous, E- and
B-mode subspaces. With simple Fisher information estimates, I show that a
non-trivial amount of information on typical cosmological parameters is
contained in the ambiguous mode subspace computed in this formalism. Next, I
give two examples which apply these practical estimators and recipes to generic
problems in cosmic shear data analysis: data compression and spatially locating
B-mode contamination. In particular, by using wavelet-like estimators with the
shear correlation functions directly, one can pinpoint B-mode contamination to
specific angular scales and extract information on its shape. Finally, I
discuss how these estimators can be used as part of blinded or closed-box
cosmic shear data analyses in order to assess and find B-mode contamination at
high-precision while avoiding observer biases.

Accordingly, we consider rewritings that can exploit a single view, by means of
compensation, and rewritings that can use multiple views, by means of
intersection. Since in a probabilistic setting queries return answers with
probabilities, the problem of rewriting goes beyond the classic one of
retrieving XML answers from views. For both semantics of XML queries, we show

MVDB is a (very large) Markov Logic Network. We make two sets of contributions.
First, we show that query evaluation on an MVDB is equivalent to evaluating a
Union of Conjunctive Query(UCQ) over a tuple-independent database. The
translation is exact (thus allowing the techniques developed for tuple
independent databases to be carried over to MVDB), yet it is novel and quite
non-obvious (some resulting probabilities may be negative!). This translation
in itself though may not lead to much gain since the translated query gets
complicated as we try to capture more correlations. Our second contribution is
to propose a new query evaluation strategy that exploits offline compilation to
speed up online query evaluation. Here we utilize and extend our prior work on
compilation of UCQ. We validate experimentally our techniques on a large
probabilistic database with MarkoViews inferred from the DBLP data.

of the coordination task is shifted from the user to the database.
Unfortunately, evaluating entangled queries is very hard, and thus previous
work considered only a restricted class of queries that satisfy safety (the
coordination partners are fixed) and uniqueness (all queries need to be
satisfied). In this paper we significantly extend the class of feasible
entangled queries beyond uniqueness and safety. First, we show that we can
simply drop uniqueness and still efficiently evaluate a set of safe entangled
queries. Second, we show that as long as all users coordinate on the same set
of attributes, we can give an efficient algorithm for coordination even if the
set of queries does not satisfy safety. In an experimental evaluation we show
that our algorithms are feasible for a wide spectrum of coordination scenarios.

Although there have been some works using the (key,value) pair-based

Theta-join queries has never been fully explored. The substantial challenge
lies in, given a number of processing units (that can run Map or Reduce tasks),
mapping a multi-way Theta-join query to a number of MapReduce jobs and having
them executed in a well scheduled sequence, such that the total processing time
span is minimized. Our solution mainly includes two parts: 1) cost metrics for
both single MapReduce job and a number of MapReduce jobs executed in a certain
order; 2) the efficient execution of a chain-typed Theta-join with only one
MapReduce job. Comparing with the query evaluation strategy proposed in [23]
and the widely adopted Pig Latin and Hive SQL solutions, our method achieves
significant improvement of the join processing efficiency.

queries with known algebraic semantics. In this work, we find that a handful of

  Moreover, both classes of platform incur significant overhead in executing

bounded reachability for deciding whether there exists a path of a bounded
length between a pair of nodes, and regular reachability for checking whether
there exists a path connecting two nodes such that the node labels on the path
form a string in a given regular expression. We develop these algorithms based
on partial evaluation, to explore parallel computation. When evaluating a query
Q on a distributed graph G, we show that these algorithms possess the following
performance guarantees, no matter how G is fragmented and distributed: (1) each
site is visited only once; (2) the total network traffic is determined by the
size of Q and the fragmentation of G, independent of the size of G; and (3) the
response time is decided by the largest fragment of G rather than the entire G.
In addition, we show that these algorithms can be readily implemented in the
MapReduce framework. Using synthetic and real-life data, we experimentally
verify that these algorithms are scalable on large graphs, regardless of how

to maximize the accuracy of the query results, while satisfying the privacy

considerable accuracy gains, compared to answering them individually. However,

oxygen defect order can be highly inhomogeneous, even in ""optimal""
superconducting samples, which raises the question of the nature of the sample
regions where the order does not exist but which nonetheless form the ""glue""
binding the ordered regions together. Here we use scanning X-ray
microdiffraction (with beam 300 nm in diameter) to show that for La2CuO4+y, the
""glue"" regions contain incommensurate modulated local lattice distortions,
whose spatial extent is most pronounced for the best superconducting samples.
For an underdoped single crystal with mobile oxygen interstitials in the spacer
La2O2+y layers intercalated between the CuO2 layers, the incommensurate
modulated local lattice distortions form droplets anticorrelated with the
ordered oxygen interstitials, and whose spatial extent is most pronounced for
the best superconducting samples. In this simplest of high temperature
superconductors, there are therefore not one, but two networks of ordered
defects which can be tuned to achieve optimal superconductivity. For a given
stoichiometry, the highest transition temperature is obtained when both the
ordered oxygen and lattice defects form fractal patterns, as opposed to
appearing in isolated spots. We speculate that the relationship between
material complexity and superconducting transition temperature Tc is actually
underpinned by a fundamental relation between Tc and the distribution of
ordered defect networks supported by the materials.

By iterating the entanglement concentration process several times, the present
ECP has the total success probability approaching to the limit in theory. The
present ECP has the advantage of a high success probability. Moreover, the

non-standardness. For example, two dyadic filtrations with trivial tail

filtration indexed by the non-positive integers becomes standard when
sufficiently many integers are skipped. In this paper, we focus on the non

although they are non-standard. Two class of filtrations are studied, first the
filtrations of the split-words processes, second some filtrations inspired by
an unpublished example of B. Tsirelson. They provide examples which disproves
some naive intuitions. For example, it is possible to have a standard
filtration extracted from a non-standard one with no intermediate (for
extraction) filtration at the threshold of standardness. It is also possible to
have a filtration which provides a standard filtration on the even times but a

modeling nodal attributes as random variates, thus creating a random model of
the full network, which we call Exponential-family Random Network Models
(ERNM). We demonstrate how this framework allows a new formu- lation for
logistic regression in network data. We develop likelihood-based inference for
the model and an MCMC algorithm to implement it. This new model formulation is
used to analyze a peer social network from the National Lon- gitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health. We model the relationship between substance use and
friendship relations, and show how the results differ from the standard use of
logistic regression on network data.

circulation models of their atmospheres. Such models must be integrated
starting from an assumed initial state, which is typically taken to be a
wind-free, rest state. Here, we investigate the sensitivity of hot-Jupiter
atmospheric circulation models to initial conditions. We consider two classes
of models--shallow-water models, which have proven successful at illuminating
the dynamical mechanisms at play on these planets, and full three-dimensional
models similar to those being explored in the literature. Models are
initialized with zonal jets, and we explore a variety of different initial jet
profiles. We demonstrate that, in both classes of models, the final,
equilibrated state is independent of initial condition--as long as frictional
drag near the bottom of the domain and/or interaction with a specified
planetary interior are included so that the atmosphere can adjust angular
momentum over time relative to the interior. When such mechanisms are included,
otherwise identical models initialized with vastly different initial conditions
all converge to the same statistical steady state. In some cases, the models
exhibit modest time variability; this variability results in random
fluctuations about the statistical steady state, but we emphasize that, even in
these cases, the statistical steady state itself does not depend on initial
conditions. Although the outcome of hot-Jupiter circulation models depend on
details of the radiative forcing and frictional drag, aspects of which remain
uncertain, we conclude that the specification of initial conditions is not a
source of uncertainty, at least over the parameter range explored in most
current models.

(equal the minimal number of genome rearrangements required to transform them
into a single genome) is often used for measuring their evolutionary
remoteness. Generalization of this measure to three genomes is known as the
median score (while a resulting genome is called median genome). In contrast to
the rearrangement distance between two genomes which can be computed in linear
time, computing the median score for three genomes is NP-hard. This inspires a
quest for simpler and faster approximations for the median score, the most
natural of which appears to be the halved sum of pairwise distances which in
fact represents a lower bound for the median score.
  In this work, we study relationship and interplay of pairwise distances
between three genomes and their median score under the model of
Double-Cut-and-Join (DCJ) rearrangements. Most remarkably we show that while a
rearrangement may change the sum of pairwise distances by at most 2 (and thus
change the lower bound by at most 1), even the most ""powerful"" rearrangements
in this respect that increase the lower bound by 1 (by moving one genome
farther away from each of the other two genomes), which we call strong, do not
necessarily affect the median score. This observation implies that the two
measures are not as well-correlated as one's intuition may suggest.
  We further prove that the median score attains the lower bound exactly on the
triples of genomes that can be obtained from a single genome with strong
rearrangements. While the sum of pairwise distances with the factor 2/3
represents an upper bound for the median score, its tightness remains unclear.
Nonetheless, we show that the difference of the median score and its lower
bound is not bounded by a constant.

  Wireless Networks","9 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Secondary spectrum auction is widely applied in wireless networks for
mitigating the spectrum scarcity. In a realistic spectrum trading market, the
requests from secondary users often specify the usage of a fixed spectrum
frequency band in a certain geographical region and require a duration time in
a fixed available time interval. Considering the selfish behaviors of secondary
users, it is imperative to design a truthful auction which matches the
available spectrums and requests of secondary users optimally. Unfortunately,
existing designs either do not consider spectrum heterogeneity or ignore the
differences of required time among secondary users. In this paper, we address
this problem by investigating how to use auction mechanisms to allocate and
price spectrum resources so that the social efficiency can be maximized. We
begin by classifying the spectrums and requests from secondary users into
different local markets which ensures there is no interference between local
markets, and then we can focus on the auction in a single local market. We
first design an optimal auction based on the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
mechanism to maximize the social efficiency while enforcing truthfulness. To
reduce the computational complexity, we further propose a truthful sub-optimal
auction with polynomial time complexity, which yields an approximation factor
6+4\surd2. Our extensive simulation results using real spectrum availability
data show that the social efficiency ratio of the sub-optimal auction is always
above 70% compared with the optimal auction.

participate as a layer of regulatory interactions with miRNAs. The availability
of genome-scale datasets for argonaute targets across human transcriptome has

miRNAs and lncRNAs.
  We used well characterized experimental

the present paper is to investigate whether polarization imaging may provide
evidence either for or against the disk hypothesis. In addition, we aim at
clarifying whether there might be any additional close companion to the binary
star. Methods. We used the coronagraph PolCor in its polarization mode in
combination with an EMCCD camera allowing short unit exposure times. As a
result of shift-and-add and frame selection, the spatial resolution is improved
compared to traditional CCD imaging. In order to possibly reveal an additional
stellar companion, we used high resolution spectroscopy in the optical and high
spatial resolution imaging in the near-IR. Results. The disk/filament is much
better seen in polarization; it is narrow and a line drawn along the ridge
passes within a second of arc from the star. The degree of polarization is high
(?50% after correction for the extended component of the reflection nebula)
which means that the disk/filament must be approximately at the same distance
as the star. Although we confirm that the feature is much brighter south-east
than north-west of the star, the evidence that the feature is physically
connected to the star is strengthened and suggests that we are witnessing the
destruction process of an accretion disk. Our spectroscopy shows that at least
one of the stars is a spectroscopic binary. We were, however, not able to
spatially resolve any stellar component in addition to the two well separated

pre-stellar cores on the cloud fragmentation induced by the dust emission
cooling. Employing a simple model of grain growth in a gravitationally
collapsing gas, we show that Fe and Si grains can grow efficiently at hydrogen
densities of ~10^{10}-10^{14} cm^{-3} in the clouds with metal abundances of -5
<~ [Fe, Si/H] <~ -3. The critical metal number abundances, above which the
grain growth could induce the fragmentation of the gas clouds, are estimated to
be A_{crit} ~ 10^{-9}-10^{-8}, unless the initial grain radius is too large (>~
1 um) or the sticking probability is too small (<~ 0.01). We find that even if
the initial dust-to-gas mass ratio is well below the minimum value required for
the dust-induced fragmentation, the grain growth increases the dust mass high
enough to cause the gas fragmentation into sub-solar mass clumps. We suggest
that as long as the critical metal abundance is satisfied, the grain growth
could play an important role in the formation of low-mass stars with
metallicity as low as 10^{-5} Z_sun.

decline then trace luminosities of 0.86-0.27 L_Edd. These spectra are all
dominated by a hot disc component, which roughly follows a constant inner
radius track in luminosity and temperature as the source declines. At the
highest luminosity the disc structure should change due to advection of
radiation through the disc. This advected flux can be partly released at lower
radii thus modifying the spectral shape. To study the effect of advection at
luminosities close to Eddington we employ a fully relativistic slim disc model,
SLIMBH, that includes advective cooling and full radiative transfer through the
photosphere based on TLUSTY. The model also incorporates relativistic photon
ray-tracing from the proper location of the disc photosphere rather than the
mid-plane as the slim disc is no longer geometrically thin. We find that these
new models differ only slightly from the non-advective (standard) BHSPEC models
even at the highest luminosities considered here. While both discs can fit the
highest luminosity data, neither is a very good fit to the *lower*

against intra- and inter-embryonic variations is not understood. A common motif
in the gene regulation networks that control embryonic development is mutual
repression between pairs of genes. To assess the role of mutual repression in
the robust formation of gene expression patterns, we have performed large-scale
stochastic simulations of a minimal model of two mutually repressing gap genes
in Drosophila, hunchback (hb) and knirps (kni). Our model includes not only
mutual repression between hb and kni, but also the stochastic and cooperative
activation of hb by the anterior morphogen Bicoid (Bcd) and of kni by the
posterior morphogen Caudal (Cad), as well as the diffusion of Hb and Kni. Our
analysis reveals that mutual repression can markedly increase the steepness and
precision of the gap gene expression boundaries. In contrast to spatial
averaging and cooperative gene activation, mutual repression thus allows for
gene-expression boundaries that are both steep and precise. Moreover, mutual
repression dramatically enhances their robustness against embryo-to-embryo
variations in the morphogen levels. Finally, our simulations reveal that gap
protein diffusion plays a critical role not only in reducing the width of gap
gene expression boundaries via spatial averaging, but also in repairing
patterning errors that could arise due to the bistability induced by mutual
repression.

typical values for cyclotron features lie in the high-energy part of the

the 54 months long Swift-BAT survey of the high-mass X-ray source IGR
J16493-4348. To constrain the broadband spectrum we used soft X-ray spectra
from Swift-XRT and Suzaku pointed observations. We model the spectra using a
set of phenomenological models usually adopted to describe the energy spectrum
of accreting high-mass X-ray binaries; irrespective of the models we used, we
found significant improvements in the spectral fits adding to the models a
broad (10 keV width) absorption feature, with best-fitting energy estimate
between 30 and 33 keV, that we interpret as evidence for a resonant cyclotron
absorption feature. We also discuss instrumental issues related to the use of
Swift-BAT for this kind of studies and the statistical method to weight the
confidence level of this detection. Correcting for the gravitational redshift

provides an unique tool for the study of source star stellar atmospheres
through an enhancement of a characteristic polarization signal. This is due to
the differential magnification induced during the crossing of the source star.
In this paper we consider a specific set of reported highly magnified, both
single and binary exoplanetary systems, microlensing events towards the
Galactic bulge and evaluate the expected polarization signal. To this purpose,
we consider several polarization models which apply to different types of
source stars: hot, late type main sequence and cool giants. As a result we
compute the polarization signal P,which goes up to P=0.04% for late type stars
and up to a few percent for cool giants, depending on the underlying physical
polarization processes and atmosphere model parameters. Given a I band
magnitude at maximum magnification of about 12, and a typical duration of the
polarization signal up to 1 day, we conclude that the currently available
technology, in particular the polarimeter in FORS2 on the VLT, potentially may
allow the detection of such signals. This observational programme may take
advantage of the currently available surveys plus follow up strategy already
routinely used for microlensing monitoring towards the Galactic bulge (aimed at
the detection of exoplanets). In particular, this allows one to predict in
advance for which events and at which exact time the observing resources may be
focused to make intensive polarization measurements.

of the defects was studied using combined focussed ion beam (FIB) and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). We find that the defects originate from a local
increase of a GaAs layer thickness. Modulation heights of up to 140nm for oval
defects and 90nm for round defects are found, while the lateral extension is
about 2um for oval and 4um for round defects. The GaAs thickness increase is
attributed to Ga droplets deposited during growth due to Ga cell spitting.
Following the droplet deposition, the thickness modulation expands laterally
while reducing its height, yielding oval to round mounds of the interfaces and
the surface. With increasing growth temperature, the ellipticity of the mounds
is decreasing and their size is increasing. This suggests that the expansion is
related to the surface mobility of Ga, which with increasing temperature is
increasing and reducing its anisotropy between the [110] and [1-10]
crystallographic directions. Comprehensive data consisting of surface profiles

variations) in networks that are anonymous, unknown, and possibly dynamic. In
counting, nodes must determine the size of the network n and in naming they
must end up with unique identities. By anonymous we mean that all nodes begin
from identical states apart possibly from a unique leader node and by unknown
that nodes have no a priori knowledge of the network (apart from some minimal
knowledge when necessary) including ignorance of n. Network dynamicity is
modeled by the 1-interval connectivity model, in which communication is
synchronous and a worst-case adversary chooses the edges of every round subject
to the condition that each instance is connected. We first focus on static
networks with broadcast where we prove that, without a leader, counting is
impossible to solve and that naming is impossible to solve even with a leader
and even if nodes know n. These impossibilities carry over to dynamic networks
as well. We also show that a unique leader suffices in order to solve counting
in linear time. Then we focus on dynamic networks with broadcast. We conjecture
that dynamicity renders nontrivial computation impossible. In view of this, we
let the nodes know an upper bound on the maximum degree that will ever appear
and show that in this case the nodes can obtain an upper bound on n. Finally,
we replace broadcast with one-to-each, in which a node may send a different
message to each of its neighbors. Interestingly, this natural variation is
proved to be computationally equivalent to a full-knowledge model, in which
unique names exist and the size of the network is known.

dependence of resistivity and dc magnetic susceptibility and the temperature
dependence of zero field heat capacity in a Ti$_{0.6}$V$_{0.4}$ alloy. The
temperature dependence of the normal state dc magnetic susceptibility in this
Ti$_{0.6}$V$_{0.4}$ alloy shows T$^2$lnT behavior. The temperature dependence
of resistivity follows a T$^2$ behaviour in the range 20-50 K. On the other
hand, a term $T^3$ lnT is needed in the expression containing the electronic
and lattice heat capacities to explain the temperature dependence of heat
capacity at temperatures where $T^2$ dependence of resistivity is observed.
Such temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility, resistivity and heat
capacity are indications of the presence of spin-fluctuations in the system.
Further experimental evidence for the spin fluctuations is obtained in the form
of a negative value of T$^5$ term in the temperature dependence of resistivity.
The influence of spin-fluctuations on the superconducting properties of
Ti$_{0.6}$V$_{0.4}$ is discussed in detail. We show from our analysis of
resistivity and the susceptibility in normal and superconducting states that
the spin fluctuations present in Ti$_{0.6}$V$_{0.4}$ alloy are itinerant in
nature. There is some evidence of the existence of preformed Cooper-pairs in
the temperature range well above the superconducting transition temperature.
Our study indicates that the interesting correlations between spin-fluctuations
and superconductivity may actually be quite widespread amongst the

obtained by XMM-Newton and ATCA, along with archival optical and infrared
observations. We use data at various wavelengths to study this object and its
complex neighbourhood, in particular in the context of the star formation
activity, past and present, around the source. We analyse the X-ray spectrum to
derive some remnant's properties, such as age and explosion energy. Supernova
remnant features are detected at all observed wavelengths: soft and extended
X-ray emission is observed, arising from a thermal plasma with a temperature kT
between 0.2 keV and 0.3 keV. Optical line emission is characterised by an
enhanced [SII]/Halpha ratio and a shell-like morphology, correlating with the
X-ray emission. The source is not or only tentatively detected at near-infrared
wavelengths (< 10 microns), but there is a detection of arc-like emission at
mid and far-infrared wavelengths (24 and 70 micron) that can be unambiguously
associated with the remnant. We suggest that thermal emission from dust heated
by stellar radiation and shock waves is the main contributor to the infrared
emission. Finally, an extended and faint non-thermal radio emission correlates
with the remnant at other wavelengths and we find a radio spectral index
between -0.7 and -0.9, within the range for SNRs. The size of the remnant is
~79x64 pc and we estimate a dynamical age of about 35000 years. We definitely
confirm DEM L205 as a new SNR. This object ranks amongst the largest remnants
known in the LMC. The numerous massive stars and the recent outburst in star
formation around the source strongly suggest that a core-collapse supernova is
the progenitor of this remnant. (abridged)

most popular nodes. However, these nodes may not be appropriate relay
candidates for some target nodes, because they may have low importance relative
to these subsets of target nodes. In this paper, to improve the opportunistic
forwarding efficiency, we exploit the relative importance (called partial
centrality) of a node with respect to a group of nodes. We design a new
opportunistic forwarding scheme, opportunistic forwarding with partial
centrality (OFPC), and theoretically quantify the influence of the partial
centrality on the data forwarding performance using graph spectrum. By applying
our scheme on three real opportunistic networking scenarios, our extensive
evaluations show that our scheme achieves significantly better mean delivery

enriched in D and 15N. This is consistent with the idea that the functional
groups carrying these isotopic anomalies, nitriles and amines, were formed by
ion-molecule chemistry in the protosolar nebula. Theoretical models of
interstellar fractionation at low temperatures predict large enrichments in
both D and 15N and can account for the largest isotopic enrichments measured in
carbonaceous meteorites. However, more recent measurements have shown that, in
some primitive samples, a large 15N enrichment does not correlate with one in
D, and that some D-enriched primitive material displays little, if any, 15N
enrichment. By considering the spin-state dependence in ion-molecule reactions
involving the ortho and para forms of H2, we show that ammonia and related
molecules can exhibit such a wide range of fractionation for both 15N and D in
dense cloud cores. We also show that while the nitriles, HCN and HNC, contain
the greatest 15N enrichment, this is not expected to correlate with extreme D
enrichment. These calculations therefore support the view that Solar System 15N
and D isotopic anomalies have an interstellar heritage. We also compare our
results to existing astronomical observations and briefly discuss future tests
of this model.

intrinsic star-to-star scatter in its Fe or Ca content. From our analysis, we
assess that all the investigated stars share the same [Fe/H], [Ca/Fe] and
[Ti/Fe] abundance ratios, while a large spread in Mg and K abundances is
detected. The distribution of [Mg/Fe] is bimodal, with ~40% of the observed
targets having subsolar [Mg/Fe], down to [Mg/Fe] ~ -1 dex, a level of
Mg-deficiency never observed before in globular clusters. It is found that the
large dispersion in Mg abundances is likely the main origin of the observed
dispersion of the Ca II triplet lines strengths (that can be erroneously
interpreted in terms of Fe or Ca abundance scatter) because Mg plays a relevant
role in the atmosphere of giant stars as an electron donor. A strong depletion
in the Mg abundance leads to an increase of the line strength of the Ca II
triplet, due to the variation in the electronic pressure, at a constant Fe and
Ca abundance. Finally, we detect an anti-correlation between Mg and K
abundances, not easily explainable within the framework of the current

work examines the question whether the scalar quark-antiquark states are found
in the energy region below or above 1 GeV in the physical spectrum. Contrarily
to the naive expectation, the mentioned states are found in the region above 1
GeV. Additionally, the axial-vector isotriplet state $a_1(1260)$ is described
as a quarkonium. These results have consequences for the building of order
parameters for the chiral-symmetry breaking of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).

correlated, exhibiting either attraction or repulsion. Such structural
correlations can reveal important relationships between different events.
Unfortunately, correlation relationships on graph structures are not well
studied and cannot be captured by traditional measures. In this work, we design
a novel measure for assessing two-event structural correlations on graphs.
Given the occurrences of two events, we choose uniformly a sample of ""reference

correlation measure to compute the average concordance of event density
changes. Significance can be efficiently assessed by tau's nice property of
being asymptotically normal under the null hypothesis. In order to compute the
measure in large scale networks, we develop a scalable framework using
different sampling strategies. The complexity of these strategies is analyzed.
Experiments on real graph datasets with both synthetic and real events

allows to process analytical queries directly on the transactional data. By
offering arbitrarily current snapshots of the transactional data for OLAP,

several Terabytes in a single commodity server, RAM is still a precious

Compaction consists of two tasks: First, separating the mutable working set
from the immutable ""frozen"" data. Second, compressing the immutable data and
optimizing it for efficient, memory-consumption-friendly snapshotting. Our
approach reorganizes and compresses transactional data online and yet hardly
affects the mission-critical OLTP throughput. This is achieved by unburdening

fine-grained shared-nothing configurations. We quantify the impact of
non-uniform hardware on various deployments by (a) examining how efficiently
each deployment uses the available hardware resources and (b) measuring the
impact of distributed transactions and skewed requests on different workloads.
Finally, we argue in favor of shared-nothing deployments that are topology- and

Taylor series in the initial Lagrangian dark matter density fluctuation field.
We show that if this Lagrangian bias is local, and the initial conditions are
Gaussian, then the two-point cross-correlation between halos and mass should be
linearly proportional to the mass-mass auto-correlation function. This
statement is exact and valid on all scales; there are no higher order
contributions, e.g., from terms proportional to products or convolutions of
two-point functions, which one might have thought would appear upon truncating
the Taylor series of the halo bias function. In addition, the auto-correlation
function of locally biased tracers can be written as a Taylor series in the
auto-correlation function of the mass; there are no terms involving, e.g.,
derivatives or convolutions. Moreover, although the leading order coefficient,
the linear bias factor of the auto-correlation function is just the square of
that for the cross-correlation, it is the same as that obtained from expanding
the mean number of halos as a function of the local density only in the
large-scale limit. In principle, these relations allow simple tests of whether
or not halo bias is indeed local in Lagrangian space. We discuss why things are
more complicated in practice. We also discuss our results in light of recent
work on the renormalizability of halo bias, demonstrating that it is better to
renormalize than not. We use the Lognormal model to illustrate many of our
findings.

scale in the nuclei of 4 galaxies, while for the other five sources we set an

NGC 4138, radio emission is detected at both 1.7 and 5 GHz and it is resolved
in two or more components. We describe the structural and spectral properties
of these features; we find that in each of these three nuclei there is one

flat/intermediate spectral index (0.3\leq alpha \leq 0.6, S(nu) \sim

natural explanation. A faint feature is detected in NGC 4477 at 5 GHz; keeping

considering its very short orbital period. Given the age of the system, this
planet should have been tidally circularized a long time ago. Many attempts to
explain this were proposed in recent years, either involving abnormally weak
tides, or the perturbing action of a distant companion. We address here the
latter issue based on Kozai migration. We propose that GJ 436b was formerly
located further away from the star and that it underwent a migration induced by
a massive, inclined perturber via Kozai mechanism. In this context, the
perturbations by the companion trigger high amplitude variations to GJ 436b
that cause tides to act at periastron. Then the orbit tidally shrinks to reach
its present day location. We numerically integrate the 3-body system including
tides and General Relativity correction. We first show that starting from the
present-day location of GJ 436b inevitably leads to damping the Kozai
oscillations and to rapidly circularizing the planet. Conversely, starting from
5-10 times further away allows the onset of Kozai cycles. The tides act in peak
eccentricity phases and reduce the semi-major axis of the planet. The net
result is an evolution characterized by two phases: a first one with Kozai
cycles and a slowly shrinking semi-major axis, and a second one once the planet
gets out of the Kozai resonance characterized by a more rapid decrease. The
timescale of this process appears in most cases much longer than the standard
circularization time of the planet by a factor larger than 50. This model can
provide a solution to the eccentricity paradox of GJ 436b. Depending on the
various orbital configurations, it can take several Gyrs to GJ 436b to achieve
a full orbital decrease and circularization. According to this scenario, we
could be witnessing today the second phase of the scenario where the semi-major
axis is already reduced while the eccentricity is still significant. We then
explore the parameter space and derive in which conditions this model can be
realistic given the age of the system. This yields constraints on the
characteristics of the putative companion.

granular system compatible to a macrostate that is set by the external stress.
The nature of this phase space is analyzed, showing that the consideration of
the allowed and forbidden regions and the internal degrees of freedom of every
configuration (i.e. geometrical pattern) could be a relevant factor for the
establishment of its probability and, therefore, of the expected properties of
the sample. This is due to the fact that many combinations of forces acting on
a particle can keep it in static equilibrium. Every set of forces can be
considered equivalent to a microscopic stress field, but the kind of
interaction and the geometrical restrictions mean that not all stress states
can be represented by any set, whereas others can be represented by many sets.
Consequently the points of the phase space are degenerate, and the density of
states of each configuration strongly determines the most probable statistical
distribution. It is shown how these functions just depend on the deviatoric
stress. A first analysis of two-dimensional (2D) arrangements is included to
clarify this assertion.

in proximity to another broken symmetry. In heavy-electron superconductors, the
nearby ordered state most commonly is magnetism, and the so-called Ce115
heavy-electron compounds have been particularly instructive for revealing new
relationships between magnetism and superconductivity. From measurements of the
resistive and bulk transitions to superconductivity in these materials, we find
that the resistive transition appears at a temperature considerably higher than
the bulk transition when superconductivity and magnetic order coexist, but this
temperature difference disappears in the absence of long-range magnetic order.
Further, in the pressure-temperature region of coexistence in CeRhIn5, a new
anisotropy in the resistive transition develops even though the tetragonal
crystal structure apparently remains unchanged, implying a form of textured
superconductivity. We suggest that this texture may be a generic response to
coexisting order in these and other heavy-fermion superconductors.

can mimic measurement devices, and it can also be used to reveal dynamical
properties of the closed system. In this paper we provide an unified treatment
of leaking systems and we review applications to different physical problems,
both in the classical and quantum pictures. Our treatment is based on the
transient chaos theory of open systems, which is essential because real leaks
have finite size and therefore estimations based on the closed system differ
essentially from observations. The field of applications reviewed is very
broad, ranging from planetary astronomy and hydrodynamical flows, to plasma
physics and quantum fidelity. The theory is expanded and adapted to the case of
partial leaks (partial absorption/transmission) with applications to room
acoustics and optical microcavities in mind. Simulations in the lima .con
family of billiards illustrate the main text. Regarding billiard dynamics, we
emphasize that a correct discrete time representation can only be given in
terms of the so- called true-time maps, while traditional Poincar \'e maps lead
to erroneous results. We generalize Perron-Frobenius-type operators so that
they describe true-time maps with partial leaks.

of a population's infected fraction, ranging from steady-state to chaotic. We
show that period doubling arises as we increase the average node degree, and
that the universality class of this well known route to chaos depends on the
interaction structure of random networks rather than the microscopic behavior
of individual nodes. We find that increasing the fixedness of the system tends
to stabilize the infected fraction, yet disjoint, multiple equilibria are
possible depending solely on the choice of the initially infected node.

involving the use of Bayes' theorem and the choice of a probability prior. When

insensitive to the form of the prior. In the oposite case of scarse data, it is
suggested that the probabilities are assigned such that they are the least
sensitive to specific variations of the probability prior. In the continuous
