smart-grid networks. This is studied within a network utility maximization
(NUM) framework in a deterministic setting with a single provider, multiple
users and a finite horizon. The provider produces power or buys power in a
(deterministic) spot market, and determines a dynamic price to charge the
users. The users then adjust their demand in response to the time-varying
prices. This is typically categorized as the demand response problem, and we
study a progression of related models by focusing on two aspects: 1) the
characterization of the structure of the optimal dynamic prices in the Smart
Grid and the optimal demand and supply under various interaction with a spot
market; 2) a greedy approach to facilitate the solution process of the
aggregate NUM problem and the optimality gap between the greedy solution and
the optimal one.

with 208Pb has been the subject of a number of theoretical studies with widely
differing predictions, ranging over four orders of magnitude, for the fusion
excitation function.
  Purpose: To measure the excitation function for the 11Li + 208Pb reaction.
  Methods: A stacked foil/degrader assembly of 208Pb targets was irradiated
with a 11Li beam producing center of target beam energies from above barrier to
near barrier energies (40 to 29 MeV). The intensity of the 11Li beam (chopped)
was 1250 p/s and the beam on-target time was 34 hours. The alpha-decay of the
stopped evaporation residues was detected in a alpha-detector array at each
beam energy in the beam-off period (the beam was on for <= 5 ns and then off
for 170 ns).
  Results: The 215At evaporation residues were associated with the fusion of
11Li with 208Pb. The 213,214At evaporation residues were formed by the breakup
of 11Li into 9Li + 2n, with the 9Li fusing with 208Pb. The 214At evaporation
residue appears to result from a ""quasi-breakup"" process.
  Conclusions: Most of 11Li + 208Pb interactions lead to breakup with a small
fraction (<= 11%) leading to complete fusion.

Intrinsic dust extinction effects are taken into account by using far-infrared
observations. Synthetic SEDs created with different stellar population
synthesis models are fitted to the observed SEDs, providing estimates for the
stellar mass surface density. The stellar mass distribution of the galaxy is
described with a 3D model consisting of a nucleus, a bulge, a disc, a young
disc and a halo component, each following the Einasto density distribution
(relations between different functional forms of the Einasto density
distribution are given in App. B). By comparing the stellar mass distribution
to the observed rotation curve and kinematics of outer globular clusters and
satellite galaxies, the DM halo parameters are estimated.
  Stellar population synthesis models suggest that M31 is dominated by old
stars throughout the galaxy. The total stellar mass is (10-15)10^10Msun, 30% of
which is in the bulge and 56% in the disc. None of the tested DM distribution

(0.8-1.1)10^12Msun and the virial radius is 189-213kpc, depending on the DM
distribution. The central density of the DM halo is comparable to that of
nearby dwarf galaxies, low-surface-brightness galaxies and distant massive disc

sheet perturbation theory. If they exist as models of quantum gravity, they are
defined by conformal field theories, and each is an independent quantum system,
which makes no transitions to any of the others. This landscape has nothing to
do with CDL tunneling or eternal inflation.
  A proper understanding of CDL transitions in QFT on a fixed background dS
space, shows that the EI picture of this system is not justified within the
approximation of low energy effective field theory. The cutoff independent
physics, defined by the Euclidean functional integral over the 4-sphere admits
only a finite number of instantons. Plausible extensions of these ideas to a
quantum theory of gravity obeying the holographic principle explain all of the
actual facts about CDL transitions in dS space, and lead to a picture radically
different from eternal inflation.
  Theories of Eternal Inflation (EI) have to rely too heavily on the anthropic
principle to be consistent with experiment. Given the vast array of effective
low energy field theories that could be produced by the conventional picture of
the string landscape one is forced to conclude that the most numerous
anthropically allowed theories will disagree with experiment violently.

atmosphere is studied through three-dimensional numerical simulations. An
upward propagating fast acoustic wave is excited in the high-beta region of the
model. The new wave modes generated at the conversion layer are analyzed from
the projections of the velocity and magnetic field in their characteristic
directions, and the computation of their wave energy and fluxes. The analysis
reveals that the maximum efficiency of the conversion to the slow mode is
obtained for inclinations of 25 degrees and low azimuths, while the Alfven wave
conversions peaks at high inclinations and azimuths between 50 and 120 degrees.
Downward propagating Alfven waves appear at the regions of the sunspot where
the orientation of the magnetic field is in the direction opposite to the wave
propagation, since at these locations the Alfven wave couples better with the
downgoing fast magnetic wave which are reflected due to the gradients of the
Alfven speed. The simulations shows that the Alfven energy at the chromosphere
is comparable to the acoustic energy of the slow mode, being even higher at
high inclined magnetic fields.

unifying approach to such models, since they can be viewed as the outcome of
the same discrete dislocation setup, for different values of the dimensionless

the rigorous nature of the upscaling removes the need for ad hoc assumptions.

neutrinoless double-beta (0\nu\beta\beta) decay one needs a precise computation
of the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) associated with this process. Approaches
based on the Shell Model (ShM) are among the nuclear structure methods used for
their computation. ShM better incorporates the nucleon correlations, but have
to face the problem of the large model spaces and computational resources. The
goal is to develop a new, fast algorithm and the associated computing code for
efficient calculation of the two-body matrix elements (TBMEs) of the
0\nu\beta{\beta} decay transition operator, which are necessary to calculate
the NMEs. This would allow us to extend the ShM calculations for double-beta
decays to larger model spaces, of about 9-10 major harmonic oscillator shells.
The improvement of our code consists in a faster calculation of the radial
matrix elements. Their computation normally requires the numerical evaluation
of two-dimensional integrals: one over the coordinate space and the other over
the momentum space. By rearranging the expressions of the radial matrix
elements, the integration over the coordinate space can be performed
analytically, thus the computation reduces to sum up a small number of
integrals over momentum. Our results for the NMEs are in a good agreement with
similar results from literature, while we find a significant reduction of the
computation time for TBMEs, by a factor of about 30, as compared with our
previous code that uses two-dimensional integrals.

an emphasis on low-mass dark matter candidates (wimp mass of about 10 GeV/c2).
We report on the characteristics of the PPC detector presently taking data at
the Soudan Underground Laboratory, elaborating on aspects of shielding, data

A detailed background model is used to investigate the low energy excess of
events previously reported, and to assess the possibility of temporal
modulations in the low-energy event rate. Extensive simulations of all
presently known backgrounds do not provide a viable background explanation for
the excess of low-energy events in the CoGeNT data, or the previously observed
temporal variation in the event rate. Also reported on for the first time is a
determination of the surface (slow pulse rise time) event contamination in the

continues to increase, mediators become important to ensure that the wealth of
information available is tapped effectively. A key challenge that these
information mediators need to handle is the varying levels of incompleteness in
the underlying databases in terms of missing attribute values. Existing
approaches such as QPIAD aim to mine and use Approximate Functional
Dependencies (AFDs) to predict and retrieve relevant incomplete tuples. These
approaches make independence assumptions about missing values---which
critically hobbles their performance when there are tuples containing missing
values for multiple correlated attributes. In this paper, we present a
principled probabilistic alternative that views an incomplete tuple as defining
a distribution over the complete tuples that it stands for. We learn this
distribution in terms of Bayes networks. Our approach involves
mining/""learning"" Bayes networks from a sample of the database, and using it to
do both imputation (predict a missing value) and query rewriting (retrieve
relevant results with incompleteness on the query-constrained attributes, when
the data sources are autonomous). We present empirical studies to demonstrate
that (i) at higher levels of incompleteness, when multiple attribute values are
missing, Bayes networks do provide a significantly higher classification
accuracy and (ii) the relevant possible answers retrieved by the queries
reformulated using Bayes networks provide higher precision and recall than AFDs
while keeping query processing costs manageable.

general non-parametric approach that utilizes similarity information on the
space of all categories in two sample tests. Our approach extends the
graph-based tests of Friedman and Rafsky (1979) and Rosenbaum (2005), which are
tests base on graphs connecting observations by similarity. Both tests require
uniqueness of the underlying graph and cannot be directly applied on
categorical data. We explored different ways to extend graph-based tests to the
categorical setting and found two types of statistics that are both powerful
and fast to compute. We showed that their permutation null distributions are
asymptotically normal and that their $p$-value approximations under typical
settings are quite accurate, facilitating the application of the new approach.
The approach is illustrated through several examples.

optimal discrimination of coherent states--the quantum states of light emitted
by a laser--has immense practical importance. However, quantum mechanics
imposes a fundamental limit on how well different coher- ent states can be
distinguished, even with perfect detectors, and limits such discrimination to
have a finite minimum probability of error. While conventional optical
receivers lead to error rates well above this fundamental limit, Dolinar found
an explicit receiver design involving optical feedback and photon counting that
can achieve the minimum probability of error for discriminating any two given
coherent states. The generalization of this construction to larger sets of
coherent states has proven to be challenging, evidencing that there may be a
limitation inherent to a linear-optics-based adaptive measurement strategy. In
this Letter, we show how to achieve optimal discrimination of any set of
coherent states using a resource-efficient quantum computer. Our construction
leverages a recent result on discriminating multi-copy quantum hypotheses
(arXiv:1201.6625) and properties of coherent states. Furthermore, our
construction is reusable, composable, and applicable to designing
quantum-limited processing of coherent-state signals to optimize any metric of
choice. As illustrative examples, we analyze the performance of discriminating
a ternary alphabet, and show how the quantum circuit of a receiver designed to
discriminate a binary alphabet can be reused in discriminating multimode
hypotheses. Finally, we show our result can be used to achieve the quantum
limit on the rate of classical information transmission on a lossy optical
channel, which is known to exceed the Shannon rate of all conventional optical
receivers.

new materials with their atomically-flat interfaces in the heterostructures
exhibiting novel physical properties. From a fundamental point of view,
knowledge of the electronic structures of thin films and their interfaces is
indispensable to understand the origins of their functionality which further
evolves into realistic device application. In view of extreme surface
sensitivity of the conventional vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), with a probing depth of several angstroms,
experiments on thin films have to use sophisticated in-situ sample transfer
systems to avoid surface contamination. In this Letter, we put forward a method
to circumvent these difficulties using soft X-ray (SX) ARPES. A GaAs:Be thin
film in our samples was protected by an amorphous As layer with an thickness of
$\sim 1$ nm exceeding the probing depth of the VUV photoemission with photon
energy $h\nu$ around 100 eV. The increase of the probing depth with increasing
$h\nu$ towards the SX region has clearly exposed the bulk band dispersion
without any surface treatment. Any contributions from potential interface
states between the thin film and the amorphous capping layer has been below the
detection limit. Our results demonstrate that SX-ARPES enables the observation
of coherent three-dimensional band dispersion of buried heterostructure layers
through an amorphous capping layer, breaking through the necessity of surface
cleaning of thin film samples. Thereby, this opens new frontiers in diagnostics
of authentic momentum-resolved electronic structure of protected thin-film
heterostructures.

the measured Einstein radii have presented a source of tension for LCDM.
Previous cosmological tests for high-redshift clusters (z>0.5) have suffered
from small number statistics in the simulated sample and the implementation of
baryonic physics is likely to affect the outcome. We analyse zoomed-in
simulations of a fairly large sample of cluster-sized objects, with Mvir >
3x10^14 Msun/h, identified at z=0.25 and z=0.5, for a concordance LCDM
cosmology. We start with dark matter only simulations, and then add gas
hydrodynamics, with different treatments of baryonic processes: non-radiative
cooling, radiative cooling with star formation and galactic winds powered by
supernova explosions, and finally including the effect of AGN feedback. We find
that the addition of gas in non-radiative simulations does not change the
strong lensing predictions significantly, but gas cooling and star formation
together significantly increase the number of expected giant arcs and the
Einstein radii, particularly for lower redshift clusters and lower source
redshifts. Further inclusion of AGN feedback reduces the predicted strong
lensing efficiencies such that the lensing probability distributions becomes
closer to those obtained for simulations including only dark matter. Our
results indicate that the inclusion of baryonic physics in simulations will not
solve the arc-statistics problem at low redshifts, when the physical processes
included provide a realistic description of cooling in the central regions of
galaxy clusters. [Abridged]

  Dispersion",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a generalized Brownian motion model has been applied to
describe the relative particle dispersion problem in more realistic turbulent
flows. The fluctuating pressure forces acting on a fluid particle are taken to
be a colored noise and follow a stationary process and are described by the
Uhlenbeck-Ornstein model while it appears plausible to take their correlation
time to have a power-law dependence on the flow Reynolds number $R_e$, thus
introducing a bridge between the Lagrangian quantities and the Eulerian
parameters for this problem. This ansatz is in qualitative agreement with the
possibility of a connection speculated earlier by Corrsin [26] between the
white-noise representation for the fluctuating pressure forces and the
large-$R_e$ assumption in the Kolmogorov [4] theory for the 3D fully developed
turbulence (FDT) as well as the argument of Monin and Yaglom [23] and the
result of Sawford [13] and Borgas and Sawford [24] that the Lagrangian
acceleration is delta-function auto-correlated in the infinite-$R_e$ limit. It
also provides an insight into the result that the Richardson-Obukhov scaling
holds only in the infinite-$R_e$ limit and disappears otherwise. This ansatz
further confirms the Lin-Reid [18] conjecture regarding the connection between
the fluctuating pressure-force parameter and the energy dissipation rate in
turbulence and leads to an $R_e$-dependent explicit relation between the two
speculated by Lin and Reid [18]. More specifically, this ansatz provides a
determination of the Richardson-Obukhov constant $g$ as a function of $R_e$,
with an asymptotic constant value in the infinite-$R_e$ limit. It is shown to
lead to full agreement, in the small-$R_e$ limit as well, with the
Batchelor-Townsend [27] scaling for the rate of change of the mean square
interparticle separation in 3D FDT, hence validating its soundness further.

features of Pulsar Wind Nebulae as Cosmic Accelerators. I discuss recent
studies of Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe). I pay special attention to the recently
discovered gamma ray flares in the Crab Nebula's emission, focusing on the
possibility, raised by the observations, that the accelerating electric field
exceeds the magnetic field, suggesting that reconnection in the persistent
current layer (a current sheet) plays a significant role in the behavior of
this well studied Pevatron. I address the present status of the termination
shock model for the particle accelerator that converts the wind flow energy to
the observed non thermal particle spectra, concluding that it has a number of
major difficulties related to the transverse magnetic geometry of the shock
wave. I discuss recent work on the inferred pair outflow rates, which are in
excess of those predicted by existing theories of pair creation, and use those
results to point out that the consequent mass loading of the wind reduces the
wind's bulk flow 4-velocity to the point that dissipation of the magnetic field
in a pulsar's wind upstream of the termination shock is restored to life as a
viable model for the solution of the ""sigma problem"". I discuss some
suggestions that current starvation in the current flow supporting the
structured (""striped"") upstream magnetic field induces a transition to
superluminal wave propagation. I show that current starvation probably does not
occur, because those currents are carried in the current sheet separating there
stripes rather than in the stripes themselves.

of certain dynamic properties, such as density scaling of the relaxation times
and isochronal superpositioning of the relaxation function. In this work we
employ molecular dynamics simulations (mds) on methanol and two variations,
lacking hydrogen bonds and a dipole moment, to assess the connection between
the correlation of U and W and these dynamic properties. We show, in accord
with prior results of others [T.S. Ingebrigtsen, T.B. Schroder, J.C. Dyre,
Phys. Rev. X 2, 011011 (2012).], that simple van der Waals liquids exhibit both
strong correlations and the expected dynamic behavior. However, for polar
liquids this correspondence breaks down - weaker correlation between U and W is
not associated with worse conformance to density scaling or isochronal
superpositioning. The reason for this is that strong correlation between U and
W only requires their proportionality, whereas the expected dynamic behavior
depends primarily on constancy of the proportionality constant for all state
points. For hydrogen-bonded liquids, neither strong correlation nor adherence
to the dynamic properties is observed; however, this nonconformance is not
directly related to the concentration of hydrogen bonds, but rather to the
greater deviation of the intermolecular potential from an inverse power law
(IPL). Only (hypothetical) liquids having interactions governed strictly by an
IPL are perfectly correlating and exhibit the consequent dynamic properties
over all thermodynamic conditions.

  Sdoia","17 pages, 1 figure",,,,"stat.AP physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent article, I showed that in several academic disciplines in Italy,
professors display a paucity of last names that cannot be explained by
unbiased, random, hiring processes. I suggested that this scarcity of last
names could be related to the prevalence of nepotistic hires, i.e., professors
engaging in illegal practices to have their relatives hired as academics. My
findings have recently been questioned through repeat analysis to the United
Kingdom university system. Ferlazzo & Sdoia found that several disciplines in
this system also display a scarcity of last names, and that a similar scarcity
is found when analyzing the first (given) names of Italian professors. Here I
show that the scarcity of first names in Italian disciplines is completely
explained by uneven male/female representation, while the scarcity of last
names in United Kingdom academia is due to discipline-specific immigration.
However, these factors cannot explain the scarcity of last names in Italian
disciplines. Geographic and demographic considerations -- proposed as a
possible explanation of my findings -- appear to have no significant effect:
after correcting for these factors, the scarcity of last names remains highly
significant in several disciplines, and there is a marked trend from north to
south, with a higher likelihood of nepotism in the south and in Sicily.
Moreover, I show that in several Italian disciplines positions tend to be
inherited as with last names (i.e., from father to son, but not from mother to
daughter). Taken together, these results strenghten the case for nepotism,
highlighting that statistical tests cannot be applied to a dataset without
carefully considering the characteristics of the data and critically
interpreting the results.

result, since it is precisely for materials having small values of v that
direct measurements are not feasible, so that v must be calculated from other
elastic constants. Herein we measure directly Poisson's ratio for four
materials, two for which the more restrictive bounds on v apply, and two having
values below this limit of 0.2. We find that while the measured v for the
former are equivalent to values calculated from the shear and tensile moduli,
for two auxetic materials (v < 0), the equations of classical elasticity give
inaccurate values of v. This is experimental corroboration that the correct
lower limit on Poisson's ratio is 0.2 in order for classical elasticity to
apply.

history of heating because pure CO2 ice forms only at elevated temperature, T >
20 K, and thus around protostars of higher luminosity. Current internal
luminosities of YSOs with L < 1 Lsun do not provide the conditions needed to
produce pure CO2 ice at radii where typical envelopes begin. The presence of
detectable amounts of pure CO2 ice would signify a higher past luminosity. Many
of the spectra require a contribution from a pure, crystalline CO2 component,
traced by the presence of a characteristic band splitting in the 15.2
micrometer bending mode. About half of the sources (9 out of 19) in the low
luminosity sample have evidence for pure CO2 ice, and six of these have
significant double-peaked features, which are very strong evidence of pure CO2
ice. The presence of the pure CO2 ice component indicates that the dust
temperature, and hence luminosity of the central star/accretion disk system,
must have been higher in the past. An episodic accretion scenario, in which
mixed CO-CO2 ice is converted to pure CO2 ice during each high luminosity
phase, explains the presence of pure CO2 ice, the total amount of CO2 ice, and

such as human mobility for traffic analysis and urban planning. There is a
pressing need for scalable and efficient techniques for analyzing this data and
discovering the underlying patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel
technique which we call vector-field $k$-means.
  The central idea of our approach is to use vector fields to induce a
similarity notion between trajectories. Other clustering algorithms seek a
representative trajectory that best describes each cluster, much like $k$-means
identifies a representative ""center"" for each cluster. Vector-field $k$-means,
on the other hand, recognizes that in all but the simplest examples, no single
trajectory adequately describes a cluster. Our approach is based on the premise
that movement trends in trajectory data can be modeled as flows within multiple
vector fields, and the vector field itself is what defines each of the
clusters. We also show how vector-field $k$-means connects techniques for
scalar field design on meshes and $k$-means clustering.
  We present an algorithm that finds a locally optimal clustering of
trajectories into vector fields, and demonstrate how vector-field $k$-means can
be used to mine patterns from trajectory data. We present experimental evidence
of its effectiveness and efficiency using several datasets, including
historical hurricane data, GPS tracks of people and vehicles, and anonymous
call records from a large phone company. We compare our results to previous
trajectory clustering techniques, and find that our algorithm performs faster
in practice than the current state-of-the-art in trajectory clustering, in some

distinct cell subsets from blood and tissue is crucial to decipher system level

A common problem in the analysis of such data is to identify biomarkers (or
combinations of thereof) that are differentially expressed between two
biological conditions (e.g., before/after vaccination), where expression is
defined as the proportion of cells expressing the biomarker or combination in
the cell subset of interest.
  Here, we present a Bayesian hierarchical framework based on a beta-binomial
mixture model for testing for differential biomarker expression using
single-cell assays. Our model allows inference to be subject specific, as is
typically required when accessing vaccine responses, while borrowing strength
across subjects through common prior distributions. We propose two approaches
for parameter estimation: an empirical-Bayes approach using an
Expectation-Maximization algorithm and a fully Bayesian one based on a Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We compare our method against frequentist
approaches for single-cell assays including Fisher's exact test, a likelihood
ratio test, and basic log-fold changes. Using several experimental assays
measuring proteins or genes at the single-cell level and simulated data, we
show that our method has higher sensitivity and specificity than alternative
methods. Additional simulations show that our framework is also robust to model
misspecification. Finally, we also demonstrate how our approach can be extended
to testing multivariate differential expression across multiple biomarker
combinations using a Dirichlet-multinomial model and illustrate this
multivariate approach using single-cell gene expression data and simulations.

far there is no compelling thermodynamic evidence as to whether the pseudogap

of this line is such that it terminates at zero temperature inside the

calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAI) and micron-sized corundum grains, show
that short-lived radionuclides (SLR), e.g., 26Al, were present in the early
Solar System. Their abundances require a local origin, which however is far
from being understood. We present for the first time the abundances of several
SLR up to 60Fe predicted from stars with initial mass in the range roughly 7-11
Msun. These stars evolve through core H, He, and C burning. After core C
burning they go through a ""Super""-asymptotic giant branch (Super-AGB) phase,
with the H and He shells activated alternately, episodic thermal pulses in the
He shell, a very hot temperature at the base of the convective envelope (~ 10^8
K), and strong stellar winds driving the H-rich envelope into the surrounding
interstellar medium. The final remnants of the evolution of Super-AGB stars are
mostly O-Ne white dwarfs. Our Super-AGB models produce 26Al/27Al yield ratios ~
0.02 - 0.26. These models can account for the canonical value of the 26Al/27Al
ratio using dilutions with the Solar Nebula of the order of 1 part of Super-AGB
mass per several 10^2 to several 10^3 of Solar Nebula mass, resulting in
associated changes in the O composition in the range 3 permil to 20 permil.
This is in agreement with observations of the O isotopic ratios in primitive
Solar System condensated, which do not carry the signature of a stellar
pollutor. The radionuclides 41Ca and 60Fe are produced by neutron captures in
Super-AGB stars and their meteoritic abundances are also matched by some of our
models, depending on the nuclear and stellar physics uncertainties as well as
the meteoritic experimental data. We also expect and are currently
investigating Super-AGB production of SLR heavier than iron, such as 107Pd.

them as $F_1 = 1$, $F_2 = 2$, $F_3 = 3$, $F_4 = 5, ...$, then every positive
integer can be written uniquely as a sum of non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers.
This is now known as Zeckendorf's theorem [21], and similar decompositions
exist for many other sequences ${G_{n+1} = c_1 G_{n} + ... + c_L G_{n+1-L}}$
arising from recurrence relations. Much more is known. Using continued fraction
approaches, Lekkerkerker [15] proved the average number of summands needed for
integers in $[G_n, G_{n+1})$ is on the order of $C_{{\rm Lek}} n$ for a
non-zero constant; this was improved by others to show the number of summands
has Gaussian fluctuations about this mean.
  Kolo$\breve{{\rm g}}$lu, Kopp, Miller and Wang [17, 18] recently recast the
problem combinatorially, reproving and generalizing these results. We use this
new perspective to investigate the distribution of gaps between summands. We
explore the average behavior over all $m \in [G_n, G_{n+1})$ for special
choices of the $c_i$'s. Specifically, we study the case where each $c_i \in
{0,1}$ and there is a $g$ such that there are always exactly $g-1$ zeros
between two non-zero $c_i$'s; note this includes the Fibonacci, Tribonacci and
many other important special cases. We prove there are no gaps of length less
than $g$, and the probability of a gap of length $j > g$ decays geometrically,
with the decay ratio equal to the largest root of the recurrence relation.
These methods are combinatorial and apply to related problems; we end with a
discussion of similar results for far-difference (i.e., signed) decompositions.

between the mechanical modes. In the case of linear coupling, the coherent
contribution to the interaction can be exploited e.g. in quantum state swapping
protocols, while the incoherent part leads to significant modifications of cold
damping or amplification from the single-mode situation. Quadratic coupling can
result in a wealth of possible effective interactions including the analogs of
second-harmonic generation and four-wave mixing in nonlinear optics, with
specific forms depending sensitively on the sign of the coupling. The
cavity-mediated mechanical interaction of two modes is investigated in two
limiting cases, the resolved sideband and the Doppler regime. As an

in the decay rates of scalar fields: the late-time rates seemed to depend on
whether finite distance observers are in the strong field domain or far away
from the rotating black hole, an apparent phenomenon dubbed ""splitting"". We
discuss far-field ""splitting"" in the full field and near-horizon ""splitting"" in
certain projected modes using horizon-penetrating, hyperboloidal coordinates.
For either case we propose an explanation to the cause of the ""splitting""

be ambiguous or immeasurable. The far-field ""splitting"" is explained by
competition between projected modes. The near-horizon ""splitting"" is due to
excitation of lower multipole modes that back excite the multipole mode for
which ""splitting"" is observed. In both cases ""splitting"" is an intermediate
effect, such that asymptotically in time strong field rates are valid at all
finite distances. At any finite time, however, there are three domains with
different decay rates whose boundaries move outwards during evolution. We then
propose a formula for the decay rate of tails that takes into account the
inter--mode excitation effect that we study.

is achieved through the reciprocity of the embedding and detection invariants.
The embedded patterns are real onedimensional Mellin monomial patterns
distributed over two-dimensions. The embedded patterns are scale invariant and
can be directly embedded in an image by simple pixel addition. Detection
achieves rotation and general affine invariance by signal projection using
implicit Radon transformation. Embedded signals contract to one-dimension in
the two-dimensional Fourier polar domain. The real signals are detected by
correlation with complex Mellin monomial templates. Using a unique template of
4 chirp patterns we detect the affine signature with exquisite sensitivity and
moderate security. The practical implementation achieves efficiencies through
fast Fourier transform (FFT) correspondences such as the projection-slice
theorem, the FFT correlation relation, and fast resampling via the chirp-z
transform. The overall method utilizes orthodox spread spectrum patterns for
the payload and performs well in terms of the classic

When combining GaN and AlN in to a heterostructure a spatial projection of
wavefunctions indicate that valence band offset between states becomes of order
of 0.85 V. Systematic analysis of influence of number of Ga atomic layers on
the properties of wells have shown that for thickness up to 4 Ga layers, GaN
behave as carriers locating potential minimum rather, while for larger
thickness it is a standard quantum well. In all cases wells has strongly
localized quantum states close to valance band maxima (VBM) and conduction band
minimum (CBM). The calculated oscillator strength values rapidly decreases for
the well thickness in excess of 8 Ga layers (~21 {\AA}) which indicates that
wells for UV emitters should be much thinner than these based on InGaN/GaN

conserved quantity in any interaction. With the advent of special relativity,
mass became no longer a conserved quantity, since energy and momenta had the
status of conserved variables. Nevertheless, the expression for relativistic
mass gives a Poincare invariant measure that can be associated as the mass, a
useful attribute of the body or system. In the quantum regime, mass becomes
truly dynamical. Higgs field is said to provide mass to all the species of
elementary constituents - as widely popularized by the media in connection with
the recent (most likely) discovery of the Higgs meson at CERN. However, we
emphasize that the most abundant component of matter - Nucleons - derives its

the QCD scale determined experimentally, through a self consistent perturbative

mass loss of late-type supergiants are still not well known. Binaries such as
alpha Sco provide the most detailed empirical information about the winds of
these stars.
  Aims: The goal was to improve the binary technique for the determination of
the mass-loss rate of alpha Sco A by including a realistic density distribution
and velocity field from hydrodynamic and plasma simulations.
  Methods: We performed 3D hydrodynamic simulations of the circumstellar
envelope of alpha Sco in combination with plasma simulations accounting for the
heating, ionization, and excitation of the wind by the radiation of alpha Sco
B. These simulations served as the basis for an examination of circumstellar
absorption lines in the spectrum of alpha Sco B as well as of emission lines
from the Antares nebula.
  Results: The present model of the extended envelope of alpha Sco reproduces
some of the structures that were observed in the circumstellar absorption lines
in the spectrum of alpha Sco B. Our theoretical density and velocity
distributions of the outflow deviate considerably from a spherically expanding
model, which was used in previous studies. This results in a higher mass-loss
rate of (2 +/- 0.5) x 10^-6 M_sun/yr. The hot H II region around the secondary

orbital angular momentum and initial black hole spin. This approach is based on
the Buonanno, Kidder, and Lehner method for binary black holes, and it is
successfully tested against the results of numerical-relativity simulations:
the dimensionless spin parameter is predicted with absolute error $\lesssim
0.02$, whereas the relative error on the final mass is $\lesssim 2$%, its
distribution in the tests being pronouncedly peaked at $1$%. Our approach and
the fit to the torus remnant mass reported in Foucart (2012) thus constitute an
easy-to-use analytical model that accurately describes the remnant of black
hole-neutron star mergers. The space of parameters consisting of the binary
mass ratio, the initial black hole spin, and the neutron star mass and equation
of state is investigated. We provide indirect support to the cosmic censorship
conjecture for black hole remnants of black hole-neutron star mergers. We show
that the presence of a neutron star affects the quasinormal mode frequency of
the black hole remnant, thus suggesting that the ringdown epoch of the
gravitational wave signal may virtually be used to (1) distinguish black
hole-black hole from black hole-neutron star mergers and to (2) constrain the
neutron star equation of state.

speeds up data transfer for wireless networks. On the other hand, the
allocation of multiple channels to a single user decreases the probability of
finding a free logical channel for new connections, which may result in a
network-wide throughput loss. While this relationship has been studied
experimentally, especially in the WLAN configuration, little is known on how to
analytically model such phenomena. With the advent of Opportunistic Spectrum
Access (OSA) networks, it is even more important to understand the
circumstances in which it is beneficial to bond channels occupied by primary
users with dynamic duty cycle patterns. In this paper we propose an analytical
framework which allows the investigation of the average channel throughput at
the medium access control layer for OSA networks with channel bonding enabled.
We show that channel bonding is generally beneficial, though the extent of the
benefits depend on the features of the OSA network, including OSA network size
and the total number of channels available for bonding. In addition, we show
that performance benefits can be realized by adaptively changing the number of
bonded channels depending on network conditions. Finally, we evaluate channel
bonding considering physical layer constraints, i.e. throughput reduction
compared to the theoretical throughput of a single virtual channel due to a
transmission power limit for any bonding size.

perturbative quantization of gravity is sufficient as an effective theory
because matter becomes classical before the perturbative expansion breaks down.
This is achieved by considering the vanishing commutator between a field and
its conjugated momentum as a symmetry that is broken at low temperatures, and
by this generates the quantum phase that we currently live in, while at high
temperatures Planck's constant goes to zero.

of the abundance of two key SLRs, 26Al (mean lifetime = 1.1 Myr) and 60Fe (mean

astrophysical conditions. Our aim is to propose a coherent and generic solution
based on the most recent understanding of star-forming mechanisms. Iron-60 in
the nascent solar system is shown to have been produced by a diversity of
supernovae belonging to a first generation of stars in a giant molecular cloud.
Aluminum-26 is delivered into a dense collected shell by a single massive star
wind belonging to a second star generation. The Sun formed in the collected
shell as part of a third stellar generation. Aluminum-26 yields used in our
calculation are based on new rotating stellar models in which 26Al is present
in stellar winds during the star main sequence rather than during the
Wolf-Rayet phase alone. Our scenario eventually constrains the time sequence of
the formation of the two stellar generations that just preceded the solar
system formation, along with the number of stars born in these two generations.

  Aims: We investigate the nature of the fast magnetoacoustic wave about a
fully 3D magnetic null point, with a specific interest in its propagation, and
we look for evidence of MHD mode coupling and/or conversion to the Alfv\'en
mode.
  Methods: A special fieldline and flux-based coordinate system was constructed
to permit the introduction of a pure fast magnetoacoustic wave in the vicinity
of proper and improper 3D null points. We considered the ideal, {\beta} = 0,
MHD equations, which are solved using the LARE3D numerical code. The
constituent modes of the resulting wave were isolated and identified using the
special coordinate system. Numerical results were supported by analytical work
derived from perturbation theory and a linear implementation of the WKB method.
  Results: An initially pure fast wave is found to be permanently decoupled
from the Alfv\'en mode both linearly and nonlinearly for both proper and
improper 3D null points. The pure fast mode also generates and sustains a
nonlinear disturbance aligned along the equilibrium magnetic field. The
resulting pure fast magnetoacoustic pulse has transient behaviour, which is
found to be governed by the (equilibrium) Alfv\'en-speed profile, and a
refraction effect focuses all the wave energy towards the null point.

even when this is small compared to ambipolar and Ohmic diffusion, as the
surface density, accretion rate and angular momentum in the flow all depend
upon the product \eta_H(B.\Omega), and the inclusion of Hall diffusion may be
the solution to the magnetic braking catastrophe of star formation simulations.

were revealed. The conclusion was drawn that two types of CME exist depending
on their velocity time profile. This profile depends on the properties of the
active region where the ejection emerged. CMEs with equal ejection velocity
time dependence originate form in the same active region. All the HCMEs studied
represent loop-like structures either from the first moment of recording or a

to the associated flare X-ray radiation intensity rise time. The results of
(Zhang and Dere, 2006) on the existence of an inverse correlation between the
acceleration amplitude and duration, and also on the equality of the measured

In that spirit, the Antoinist community yearly financial reports, income and
expenses, are hereby examined along the so-called Benford's law. The latter is
often used as a test about possible accounting wrongdoings. On the other hand,
Benford's law is known to be invariant under scale and base transformation.
Therefore, as a further test, of both such data and Benford's law use, the
yearly financial reports are nonlinearly remapped through a sort of Theil
transformation, i.e. based on a log-transformation. The resulting data is again
analyzed along the Benford's law scheme. Bizarre, puzzling, features are seen.
However, it is emphasized that such a non-linear transformation can shift the
argument toward a more objective conclusion. In an Appendix, some brief
discussion is made on why the original Theil mapping should not be used. In a

fireball model, but higher values of n are possible as well for larger areas in
the fit parameter space. Our bolometric light curve and a dense spectral

of the explosion. We show that the photometric evolution of PTF12gzk is slower
than that of most SNe Ic, and its high ejecta velocities (~30,000km/s four days
after explosion) are closer to the observed velocities of broad-lined SNe Ic
associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) than to the observed velocities in
normal Type Ic SNe. The high velocities are sustained through the SN early
evolution, and are similar to those of GRB-SNe when the SN reach peak
magnitude. By comparison with the spectroscopically similar SN 2004aw, we
suggest that the observed properties of PTF12gzk indicate an initial progenitor
mass of 25-35 solar mass and a large (5-10E51 erg) kinetic energy, close to the
regime of GRB-SN properties. The host-galaxy characteristics are consistent
with GRB-SN hosts, and not with normal SN Ic hosts as well, yet this SN does
not show the broad lines over extended periods of time that are typical of
broad-line Type Ic SNe.

molecular junctions with clean, unoxidized electrode-molecule interfaces, i.e.

conclude that the TVS method allows estimating the onset of the tail of the

Fermi energy. For oxidized interfaces (e.g. the same monolayer measured with Hg

lower transition voltages (0.1 - 0.6 V) are systematically measured. These
values are explained by the presence of oxide-related density of states at

a useful technique to assess the quality of the molecule-electrode interfaces

filaments of hot and low density intergalactic medium. Most of these baryons
remain undetected even by the most advanced X-ray observatories which are
limited in sensitivity to the diffuse low density medium. The Planck satellite
has provided hundreds of detections of the hot gas in clusters of galaxies via
the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect and is an ideal instrument for
studying extended low density media through the tSZ effect. In this paper we
use the Planck data to search for signatures of a fraction of these missing
baryons between pairs of galaxy clusters. Cluster pairs are good candidates for
searching for the hotter and denser phase of the intergalactic medium (which is
more easily observed through the SZ effect). Using an X-ray catalogue of
clusters and the Planck data, we select physical pairs of clusters as
candidates. Using the Planck data we construct a local map of the tSZ effect
centered on each pair of galaxy clusters. ROSAT data is used to construct X-ray
maps of these pairs. After having modelled and subtracted the tSZ effect and
X-ray emission for each cluster in the pair we study the residuals on both the
SZ and X-ray maps. For the merging cluster pair A399-A401 we observe a
significant tSZ effect signal in the intercluster region beyond the virial
radii of the clusters. A joint X-ray SZ analysis allows us to constrain the
temperature and density of this intercluster medium. We obtain a temperature of
kT = 7.1 +- 0.9, keV (consistent with previous estimates) and a baryon density
of (3.7 +- 0.2)x10^-4, cm^-3. The Planck satellite mission has provided the
first SZ detection of the hot and diffuse intercluster gas.

negation-complete (maximal) and consistent (and hence strictly weaker than, for
example, Peano Arithmetic) and enjoy the disjunction property (like
Intuitionistic Logic). In other words, internalised proof theories are
ultrafilters and all internalised proof goals are definite in the sense of
being either provable or disprovable to an agent by means of disjunctive
internalised proofs (thus also called epistemic deciders). Still, LDiiP itself
is classical (monotonic, non-constructive), negation-incomplete, and does not
have the disjunction property. The price to pay for the negation completeness
of our interactive proofs is their non-monotonicity and non-communality (for
singleton agent communities only). As a normal modal logic, LDiiP enjoys a
standard Kripke-semantics, which we justify by invoking the Axiom of Choice on
LiiP's and then construct in terms of a concrete oracle-computable function.
LDiiP's agent-centric internalised notion of proof can also be viewed as a
negation-complete disjunctive explicit refinement of standard KD45-belief, and
yields a disjunctive but negation-incomplete explicit refinement of
S4-provability.

the two-gluon mechanism takes over at $W >$ 15 GeV. Including the bound-state
wave function effects for the two-gluon exchange mechanism gives a cross
section 0.1 - 0.4 pb, substantially smaller than that in the non-relativistic

  Contains arXiv:1010.3007 and arXiv:1111.2026 with some small additions",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uncertainty relations express the fundamental incompatibility of certain
observables in quantum mechanics. Far from just being puzzling constraints on
our ability to know the state of a quantum system, uncertainty relations are at
the heart of why some classically impossible cryptographic primitives become
possible when quantum communication is allowed. This thesis is concerned with
strong notions of uncertainty relations and their applications in quantum
information theory.
  One operational manifestation of such uncertainty relations is a purely
quantum effect referred to as information locking. A locking scheme can be
viewed as a cryptographic protocol in which a uniformly random n-bit message is
encoded in a quantum system using a classical key of size much smaller than n.
Without the key, no measurement of this quantum state can extract more than a
negligible amount of information about the message, in which case the message
is said to be ""locked"". Furthermore, knowing the key, it is possible to
recover, that is ""unlock"", the message. We give new efficient constructions of
bases satisfying strong uncertainty relations leading to the first explicit
construction of an information locking scheme. We also give several other
applications of our uncertainty relations both to cryptographic and
communication tasks.
  In addition, we define objects called QC-extractors, that can be seen as
strong uncertainty relations that hold against quantum adversaries. We provide
several constructions of QC-extractors, and use them to prove the security of
cryptographic protocols for two-party computations based on the sole assumption
that the parties' storage device is limited in transmitting quantum
information. In doing so, we resolve a central question in the so-called
noisy-storage model by relating security to the quantum capacity of storage
devices.

linear time-frequency (TF) decomposition using Gaussian, gammatone and
gammachirp filters at uniform, logarithmic and cochlear spacings in frequency.
This necessitates consideration of the use the PSP on non-asymptotic integrals
and leads to the introduction of a test for phase rate dominance. Regions of
the TF plane that pass the test and don't contain stationary phase points
contribute little or nothing to the final output. Analysis values that lie in
these regions can thus be set to zero, i.e. sparsity. In regions of the TF
plane that fail the test or are in the vicinity of stationary phase points,
synthesis is performed in the usual way. A new interpretation of the location
parameters associated with the synthesis filters leads to: (i) a new method for
locating stationary phase points in the TF plane; (ii) a test for phase rate
dominance in that plane. Together this is a TF stationary phase approximation
(TFSFA) for both analysis and synthesis. The stationary phase regions of
several elementary signals are identified theoretically and examples of
reconstruction given. An analysis of the TF phase rate characteristics for the
case of two simultaneous tones predicts and quantifies a form of simultaneous

indicating that far from thermal decoherence, the excitations behave

throughout the act of eating the candy. In our model we do not take any
microscopic mechanism of the dissolution process into account, but rather
provide an estimate which is based on easy-to-follow calculations. Having
obtained a description based on this calculation, we confirm the assumed
behavior by providing experimental data of the dissolution process. Besides a
deviation from our prediction caused by the production process of the candies
below a diameter of 2 mm, we find good agreement with our model-based
expectations. Serious questions on the optimal strategy of enjoying a candy
will be addressed, like whether it is wise to split the candy by breaking it
with the teeth or not.

(AGN) using the envisioned future Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). This review
focuses on jetted AGN, which constitute the vast majority of AGN detected at
gamma-ray energies. Future progress will be driven by the planned lower energy
threshold for very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray detections to ~10 GeV and
improved flux sensitivity compared to current-generation Cherenkov Telescope
facilities. We argue that CTA will enable substantial progress on gamma-ray
population studies by deepening existing surveys both through increased flux
sensitivity and by improving the chances of detecting a larger number of
low-frequency peaked blazars because of the lower energy threshold. More
detailed studies of the VHE gamma-ray spectral shape and variability might
furthermore yield insight into unsolved questions concerning jet formation and
composition, the acceleration of particles within relativistic jets, and the
microphysics of the radiation mechanisms leading to the observable high-energy
emission. The broad energy range covered by CTA includes energies where
gamma-rays are unaffected from absorption while propagating in the
extragalactic background light (EBL), and extends to an energy regime where VHE
spectra are strongly distorted. This will help to reduce systematic effects in
the spectra from different instruments, leading to a more reliable EBL
determination, and hence will make it possible to constrain blazar models up to
the highest energies with less ambiguity.

discovered. N-body simulations taking into account standard type-I planetary
migration suggest that protoplanets are captured into mean-motion resonant
orbits near the inner disk edge at which the migration is halted. Previous
N-body simulations suggested that orbital stability of the resonant systems
depends on number of the captured planets. In the unstable case, through close
scattering and merging between planets, non-resonant multiple systems are
finally formed. In this paper, we investigate the critical number of the
resonantly trapped planets beyond which orbital instability occurs after disk
gas depletion. We find that when the total number of planets ($N$) is larger
than the critical number ($N_{\rm crit}$), crossing time that is a timescale of
initiation of the orbital instability is similar to non-resonant cases, while
the orbital instability never occurs within the orbital calculation time
($10^8$ Kepler time) for $N\leq N_{\rm crit}$. Thus, the transition of crossing
time across the critical number is drastic. When all the planets are trapped in
7:6 resonance of adjacent pairs, $N_{\rm crit} = 4$. We examine the dependence
of the critical number of 4:3, 6:5 and 8:7 resonance by changing the orbital
separation in mutual Hill radii and planetary mass. The critical number
increases with increasing the orbital separation in mutual Hill radii with
fixed planetary mass and increases with increasing planetary mass with fixed
the orbital separation in mutual Hill radii. We also calculate the case of a
system which is not composed of the same resonance. The sharp transition of the
stability can be responsible for the diversity of multiple super-Earths
(non-resonant or resonant), that is being revealed by $Kepler$ mission.

DN may have truncated accretion disks in quiescence which can also explain the

suffer rapid inward Type I migration. In non-isothermal discs, recent work has
shown that a decreasing radial profile of the disc entropy can lead to a strong
positive corotation torque which can significantly slow down or reverse Type I
migration in laminar viscous disc models. It is not clear however how this
picture changes in turbulent disc models. The aim of this study is to examine
the impact of turbulence on the torque experienced by a low-mass planet
embedded in a non-isothermal protoplanetary disc. We particularly focus on the
role of turbulence on the corotation torque whose amplitude depends on the
efficiency of diffusion processes in the planet's horseshoe region. We
performed 2D numerical simulations using a grid-based hydrodynamical code in
which turbulence is modelled as stochastic forcing. In order to provide
estimations for the viscous and thermal diffusion coefficients as a function of
the amplitude of turbulence, we first set up non-isothermal disc models for
different values of the amplitude of the turbulent forcing. We then include a
low-mass planet and determine the evolution of its running time-averaged
torque. We show that in non-isothermal discs, the entropy-related corotation
torque can indeed remain unsaturated in the presence of turbulence. For
turbulence amplitudes that do not strongly affect the disc temperature profile,
we find that the running time-averaged torque experienced by an embedded
protoplanet is in fairly good agreement with laminar disc models with
appropriate values for the thermal and viscous diffusion coefficients. In discs
with turbulence driven by stochastic forcing, the corotation torque therefore
behaves similarly as in laminar viscous discs and can be responsible for

contribution to the elastic vector and axial form factors of the nucleon, using
elastic electroweak scattering data. Specifically, we combine elastic $\nu p$
and $\bar{\nu} p$ scattering cross section data from the Brookhaven E734
experiment with elastic $ep$ and quasi-elastic $ed$ and $e$-$^4$He scattering
parity-violating asymmetry data from the SAMPLE, HAPPEx, G0 and PVA4
experiments. We have not only determined these form factors at individual
values of momentum-transfer ($Q^2$), but also have fit the $Q^2$-dependence of
these form factors using simple functional forms. We present the results of
these fits, along with some expectations of how our knowledge of these form
factors can be improved with data from Fermilab experiments.

electronic and magnetic properties can be systematically engineered.
SrRuO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattice, with its period consisting of one unit cell
each, is very sensitive to strain change. Our first-principles simulations
reveal that in the high tensile strain region, it transits from a ferromagnetic
(FM) metal to an antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator with clear tilted octahedra,
while in the low strain region, it is a ferromagnetic metal without octahedra
tilting. Detailed analyses of three spin-down Ru-t$_{2g}$ orbitals just below
the Fermi level reveal that the splitting of these orbitals underlies these
dramatic phase transitions, with the rotational force constant of RuO$_6$
octahedron high up to 16 meV/Deg$^2$, 4 times larger than that of TiO$_6$.
Differently from nearly all the previous studies, these transitions can be
probed optically through the diagonal and off-diagonal dielectric tensor
elements. For one percent change in strain, our experimental spin moment change
is -0.14$\pm$0.06 $\mu_B$, quantitatively consistent with our theoretical value
of -0.1 $\mu_B$.

each uniformly random in $[s]^n$ but so that $X$ and $Y$ are correlated . For
each symbol $i$, we have that $Y_i = X_i$ with probability $1-\eps$ and
otherwise $Y_i$ is chosen independently and uniformly from $[s]$.
  Alice and Bob wish to use their respective strings to extract a uniformly
chosen common sequence from $[s]^k$ but without communicating. How well can
they do? The trivial strategy of outputting the first $k$ symbols yields an
agreement probability of $(1 - \eps + \eps/s)^k$. In a recent work by Bogdanov
and Mossel it was shown that in the binary case where $s=2$ and $k = k(\eps)$
is large enough then it is possible to extract $k$ bits with a better agreement
probability rate. In particular, it is possible to achieve agreement
probability $(k\eps)^{-1/2} \cdot 2^{-k\eps/(2(1 - \eps/2))}$ using a random
construction based on Hamming balls, and this is optimal up to lower order
terms.
  In the current paper we consider the same problem over larger alphabet sizes
$s$ and we show that the agreement probability rate changes dramatically as the
alphabet grows. In particular we show no strategy can achieve agreement
probability better than $(1-\eps)^k (1+\delta(s))^k$ where $\delta(s) \to 0$ as
$s \to \infty$. We also show that Hamming ball based constructions have {\em
much lower} agreement probability rate than the trivial algorithm as $s \to
\infty$. Our proofs and results are intimately related to subtle properties of
hypercontractive inequalities.

characteristic of normal Type Ia SNe, as illustrated by a comparison with SNe
1999ee, 2002bo and 2003du. The broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of
SN 2005cf is studied in combined ultraviolet (UV), optical and NIR spectra at
five epochs between ~ 8 d before and ~ 10 d after maximum light. We also
present synthetic spectra of the hydrodynamic explosion model W7, which
reproduce the key properties of SN 2005cf not only at UV-optical as previously
reported, but also at NIR wavelengths. From the radiative-transfer calculations
we infer that fluorescence is the driving mechanism that shapes the SED of SNe
Ia. In particular, the NIR part of the spectrum is almost devoid of absorption
features, and instead dominated by fluorescent emission of both iron-group
material and intermediate-mass elements at pre-maximum epochs, and pure
iron-group material after maximum light. A single P-Cygni feature of Mg II at
early epochs and a series of relatively unblended Co II lines at late phases
allow us to constrain the regions of the ejecta in which the respective
elements are abundant.

of the temperature $T$, the magnitude of the external driving field $E$, and
the lattice size. The DLG model undergoes an order-disorder second-order phase
transition at the critical temperature $T_c(E)$, such that the ordered phase is
characterized by high-density strips running along the direction of the applied
field; while in the disordered phase one has a lattice-gas-like behaviour. It
is found that the damage always spreads for all the investigated temperatures
and reaches a saturation value $D_{sat}$ that depends only on $T$. $D_{sat}$
increases for $T<T_c(E=\infty)$, decreases for $T>T_c(E=\infty)$ and is free of
finite-size effects. This behaviour can be explained as due to the existence of
interfaces between the high-density strips and the lattice-gas-like phase whose
roughness depends on $T$. Also, we investigated damage spreading for a range of
finite fields as a function of $T$, finding a behaviour similar to that of the
case with $E=\infty$.
