magnetic field in a polytropic atmosphere where, contrary to previous studies,
the field lines in the initial state are not unidirectional. We show that if
the twist is initially concentrated inside the unstable layer, the
modifications of the instability reported by several authors (see e.g. Cattaneo
et al. (1990)) are only observed when the calculation is restricted to two
dimensions. In three dimensions, the usual interchange instability occurs, in
the direction fixed by the field lines at the interface between the layer and
the field-free region. We therefore introduce a new configuration: the
instability now develops in a weakly magnetised atmosphere where the direction
of the field can vary with respect to the direction of the strong unstable
field below, the twist being now concentrated at the upper interface. Both
linear stability analysis and non-linear direct numerical simulations are used
to study this configuration. We show that from the small-scale interchange
instability, large-scale twisted coherent magnetic structures are spontaneously
formed, with possible implications to the formation of active regions from a
deep-seated solar magnetic field.

tight-binding chain with weak uncorrelated on-site disorder (the
one-dimensional Anderson model). The special emphasis is on the probability of
the anomalously localized states (ALS) with $|\psi|^{2}$ much larger than the
inverse typical localization length $\ell_{0}$. Using the solution to the
generating function $\Phi_{an}(u,\phi)$ found recently in our works we find the
ALS probability distribution $P(|\psi|^{2})$ at $|\psi|^{2}\ell_{0} >> 1$. As
an auxiliary preliminary step we found the asymptotic form of the generating
function $\Phi_{an}(u,\phi)$ at $u >> 1$ which can be used to compute other
statistical properties at the center-of-band anomaly. We show that at
moderately large values of $|\psi|^{2}\ell_{0}$, the probability of ALS at E=0
is smaller than at energies away from the anomaly. However, at very large
values of $|\psi|^{2}\ell_{0}$, the tendency is inverted: it is exponentially
easier to create a very strongly localized state at E=0 than at energies away
from the anomaly. We also found the leading term in the behavior of
$P(|\psi|^{2})$ at small $|\psi|^{2}<< \ell_{0}^{-1}$ and show that it is
consistent with the exponential localization corresponding to the Lyapunov
exponent found earlier by Kappus and Wegner and Derrida and Gardner.

chains of Lennard-Jones liquids with adjustable volatility are directed
normally onto an atomistic solid surface where they are observed to bounce,
stick, splash or disintegrate, depending on the initial velocity and the nature
of the materials involved. Drops impacting at low velocity bounce from
non-wetting surfaces but stick and subsequently spread slowly on wetting
surfaces. Higher velocity impacts produce an prompt splash followed by
disintegration of the drop, while at still higher velocity drops disintegrate
immediately. The disintegration can be understood as either a loss of coherence
of the liquid or as the result of a local temperature exceeding the
liquid-vapor coexistence value. In contrast to macroscopic drops, the presence
of vapor outside the drop does not effect the behavior in any significant way.
Nonetheless, the transition between the splashing and bouncing/sticking regimes
occur at Reynolds and Weber numbers similar to those found for larger drops.

claimed that this goal may be impeded by the strong dependence of the
difference parameter RL+PV on the reactor neutrino flux and on slight
variations of Delta M^2_32. We demonstrate that this effect results from a
spurious dependence of the difference parameter on the very high energy (8+
MeV) tail of the reactor neutrino spectrum. This dependence is spurious because
the high energy tail depends upon decays of exotic isotopes and is insensitive
to the mass hierarchy. An energy-dependent weight in the Fourier transform not
only eliminates this spurious dependence but in fact increases the chance of
correctly determining the hierarchy.

Elimination of auxiliary fields leads to the deformation of the supersymmetry

deformation starts from $\lambda \, \pa^4 {\cal F}^3$ and has higher

exploring finite size effects in perturbation theory in inverse size and even
nonperturbatively, with highly nontrivial agreements between thermodynamics and
statistical mechanics. Unlike the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy which
follows from the two-derivative Einstein-Hilbert action, these finite size
corrections depend sensitively on the phase under consideration and contain a
wealth of information about the details of compactification as well as the
spectrum of nonperturbative states in the theory. Finite-size corrections are

spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs) provide a natural and efficient tool for
computing with bandlimited functions defined on an interval. As a result, PSWFs
are becoming increasing popular in various areas in which such function occur -
this includes physics (e.g. wave phenomena, fluid dynamics), engineering (e.g.
signal processing, filter design), etc.
  To use PSWFs as a computational tool, one needs fast and accurate numerical
algorithms for the evaluation of PSWFs and related quantities, as well as for
the construction of quadratures, interpolation formulas, etc. Even though, for
the last half a century, substantial progress has been made in design of such
algorithms, the complexity of many of the existing algorithms, however, is at
least quadratic in the band limit $c$. For example, the evaluation of the $n$th
eigenvalue of the prolate integral operator requires at least $O(c^2)$
operations. Therefore, while the existing algorithms are quite satisfactory for
moderate values of $c$ (e.g. $c \leq 10^3$), they tend to be relatively slow
when $c$ is large (e.g. $c \geq 10^4$).
  In this paper, we describe several numerical algorithms for the evaluation of
PSWFs and related quantities, and design a class of PSWF-based quadratures for
the integration of bandlimited functions. Also, we perform detailed analysis of
the related properties of PSWFs. While the analysis is somewhat involved, the
resulting numerical algorithms are quite simple and efficient in practice. For
example, the evaluation of the $n$th eigenvalue of the prolate integral
operator requires $O(n+c)$ operations; also, the construction of related
accurate quadrature rules requires $O(c)$ operations.
  Our results are illustrated via several numerical experiments.

up a Markov chain over paths by alternately sampling a finite set of virtual

supply chain in order to achieve a desired outflow, reducing the costs of
inventory, or the goods timing in warehouses. The supply chain is modelled by a
conservation law for the density of processed parts coupled to an ODE for the
queue buffer occupancy. The control problem is stated as the minimization of a
cost functional J measuring the queue size and the quadratic difference between
the outflow and the expected one. The main novelty is the extensive use of
generalized tangent vectors to a piecewise constant control, which represent
time shifts of discontinuity points. Such method allows convergence results and
error estimates for an Upwind- Euler steepest descent algorithm, which is also

achieved when fitting synthetic though noisy binary-lens lightcurves, allowing

  volatility relation with wavelet band spectrum regression",,,,,"q-fin.ST","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper revisits the fractional cointegrating relationship between ex-ante
implied volatility and ex-post realized volatility. We argue that the concept
of corridor implied volatility (CIV) should be used instead of the popular
model-free option-implied volatility (MFIV) when assessing the fractional
cointegrating relation as the latter may introduce bias to the estimation. For
the realized volatility, we use recently proposed methods which are robust to
noise as well as jumps and interestingly we find that it does not affect the
implied-realized volatility relation. In addition, we develop a new tool for
the estimation of fractional cointegrating relation between implied and
realized volatility based on wavelets, a wavelet band least squares (WBLS). The
main advantage of WBLS in comparison to other frequency domain methods is that
it allows us to work conveniently with potentially non-stationary volatility
due to the properties of wavelets. We study the dynamics of the relationship in
the time-frequency domain with the wavelet coherence confirming that the
dependence comes solely from the lower frequencies of the spectra. Motivated by
this result we estimate the relationship only on this part of the spectra using
WBLS and compare our results to the fully modified narrow-band least squares
(FMNBLS) based on the Fourier frequencies. In the estimation, we use the S&P
500 and DAX monthly and bi-weekly option prices covering the recent financial
crisis and we conclude that in the long-run, volatility inferred from the
option prices using the corridor implied volatility (CIV) provides an unbiased
forecast of the realized volatility.

begin by placing these defects within the broader conceptual scheme of
extrinsic twist defects associated with symmetries of the topological state. We
explicitly study several classes of examples, including $Z_2$ and $Z_3$ twist
defects, where the topological state with N twist defects can be mapped to a
topological state without twist defects on a genus $g \propto N$ surface. To
emphasize this connection we refer to the twist defects as genons. We develop
methods to compute the projective non-abelian braiding statistics of the
genons, and we find the braiding is given by adiabatic modular transformations,
or Dehn twists, of the topological state on the effective genus g surface. We
study the relation between this projective braiding statistics and the ordinary
non-abelian braiding statistics obtained when the genons become deconfined,
finite-energy excitations. We find that the braiding is generally different, in
contrast to the Majorana case, which opens the possibility for fundamentally
novel behavior. We find situations where the genons have quantum dimension 2
and can be used for universal topological quantum computing (TQC), while the
host topological state is by itself non-universal for TQC.

line from a sample of six unlensed and spectroscopically-confirmed
870um-selected submillimetre (submm) galaxies (SMGs) at 1.1<z<1.6 from the
LABOCA Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS) Submm Survey (LESS). This is
the first survey of [OI]63um, one of the main photodissociation region (PDR)
cooling lines, in SMGs. New high-resolution ALMA interferometric 870um
continuum imaging confirms that these six Herschel-targeted SMG counterparts
are bona fide sources of submm emission. We detect [OI]63um in two SMGs with a
SNR >3, tentatively detect [OI]63um in one SMG, and constrain the line flux for
the non-detections. We also exploit the combination of submm continuum
photometry from 250-870um and our new PACS continuum measurements to constrain
the far-infrared (FIR) luminosity, L_FIR, in these SMGs to < 30%. We find that
SMGs do not show a deficit in their [OI]63um-to-far-infrared continuum
luminosity ratios (with ratios ranging from ~0.5-1.5%), similar to what was
seen previously for the [CII]158um-to-FIR ratios in SMGs. These observed ratios
are about an order of magnitude higher than what is seen typically for local
ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), which adds to the growing body of
evidence that SMGs are not simply `scaled up' versions of local ULIRGs. Rather,
the PDR line-to-L_FIR ratios suggest that the star formation modes of SMGs are
likely more akin to that of local normal (lower-luminosity) star-forming
galaxies, with the bulk of the star formation occurring in extended regions,
galaxy-scale (~kpc) in size. These observations represent the first step
towards a census of the major PDR cooling lines in typical SMGs that will be
attainable with ALMA, enabling detailed modelling to probe the global
properties of the star formation and the evolutionary status of SMGs.

the kinematic invariants s_{ij}, plus a possible three-loop correlation
involving four particles, which is described by a yet unknown function of

satisfying these constraints. We also extend the analysis to four-loop order,
finding that three additional four-particle correlations and a single
five-particle correlation appear, which again are governed by functions of

temperature and dynamics of new massive cold clumps found by ATLASGAL. Most
importantly, we derived their kinematical distances from the measured line

transitions toward 862 clumps of a flux-limited sample of submm clumps detected
by ATLASGAL and extracted 13CO (1-0) spectra from the Galactic Ring Survey

(71 sources) and for 277 clumps whose near/far distance ambiguity is resolved.
Most ATLASGAL clumps are cold with rotational temperatures from 10-30 K. They
have a wide range of NH3 linewidths, which by far exceeds the thermal
linewidth, as well as a broad distribution of high column densities with an NH3
abundance in the range of 5 to 30 * 10^{-8}. We found an enhancement of clumps
at Galactocentric radii of 4.5 and 6 kpc. The high detection rate (87%)
confirms ammonia as an excellent probe of the molecular content of the massive,
cold clumps revealed by ATLASGAL. A clear trend of increasing rotational
temperatures and linewidths with evolutionary stage is seen for source samples
ranging from 24 \mu m dark clumps to clumps with embedded HII regions. The
survey provides the largest ammonia sample of high-mass star forming clumps and
thus presents an important repository for the characterization of statistical

with a larger one, their coronae are the first to interact, producing
disturbances that remove gas from the smaller system and settle it into the
corona of the larger one. For a Milky-Way-size galaxy merging into a low-mass
group, ram pressure stripping and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability are the most
relevant of these disturbances. We argue that the turbulence generated by the
latter mixes the material of both coronae in the wake of the orbiting satellite
creating a ""warm phase"" mixture with a cooling time a factor of several shorter
than that of the ambient intragroup gas. We reach this conclusion using
analytic estimates, as well as adiabatic and dissipative high resolution
numerical simulations of a spherical corona subject to the ablation process of
a constant velocity wind with uniform density and temperature. Although this is
a preliminary analysis, our results are promising and we speculate that the
mixture could potentially trigger in situ star formation and/or be accreted
into the central galaxy as a cold gas flow resulting in a new mode of star
formation in galaxy groups and clusters.

We employ the intuitive language of fluids, allowing us to explicitly maintain

that hydrodynamics is not always a valid description for describing
cosmological perturbations in general scalar-field theories and present a
consistent alternative that nonetheless utilises the fluid language. We apply
this approach explicitly to a worked example: k-essence non-minimally coupled
to gravity. This is the simplest case which captures the essential new features
of these imperfect-fluid models. We demonstrate the generic existence of a new
scale separating regimes where the fluid is perfect and imperfect. We obtain
the equations for the evolution of dark-energy density perturbations in both
these regimes. The model also features two other known scales: the Compton
scale related to the breaking of shift symmetry and the Jeans scale which we
show is determined by the speed of propagation of small scalar-field
perturbations, i.e. causality, as opposed to the frequently used definition of
the ratio of the pressure and energy-density perturbations.

melanogaster, representing 22 population samples from the sub-Saharan ancestral
range of this species, along with one European population. Most genomes were
sequenced above 25X depth from haploid embryos. Results indicated a pervasive
influence of non-African admixture in many African populations, motivating the
development and application of a novel admixture detection method. Admixture
proportions varied among populations, with greater admixture in urban
locations. Admixture levels also varied across the genome, with localized peaks
and valleys suggestive of a non-neutral introgression process. Genomes from the
same location differed starkly in ancestry, suggesting that isolation
mechanisms may exist within African populations. After removing putatively
admixed genomic segments, the greatest genetic diversity was observed in
southern Africa (e.g. Zambia), while diversity in other populations was largely
consistent with a geographic expansion from this potentially ancestral region.
The European population showed different levels of diversity reduction on each
chromosome arm, and some African populations displayed chromosome arm-specific
diversity reductions. Inversions in the European sample were associated with
strong elevations in diversity across chromosome arms. Genomic scans were
conducted to identify loci that may represent targets of positive selection. A
disproportionate number of candidate selective sweep regions were located near
genes with varied roles in gene regulation. Outliers for Europe-Africa FST were
found to be enriched in genomic regions of locally elevated cosmopolitan
admixture, possibly reflecting a role for some of these loci in driving the
introgression of non-African alleles into African populations.

item, but what is the neurological substrate of this representation? One
hypothesis states that such representations depend upon multimodal binding
processes within a single region. Convergent evidence suggests that such a
region may exist within the temporal lobe(see Patterson 2007). To test these
hypotheses we utilized two established paradigms, behavioral priming and
physiological suppression, to examine response to the repetition of concepts
across perceptual modalities.
  Typically, examinations of the relationship between behavioral priming and
suppression have queried the extent to which suppression effects in different
brain regions correlate with single measures of behavioral priming. In
contrast, we were interested in the extent to which suppression effects within
a single brain region would correlate with multiple measures of behavioral
priming. While many sensory regions show suppression effects to specific
perceptual repetitions, we hypothesized that a region engaged in conceptual
representation would show suppression effects to conceptual repetitions, even
when the stimuli were perceptually distinct.
  Using BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) data, we determined that
suppression effects in perirhinal cortex, a temporal lobe region, significantly
correlate with behavioral priming in a multimodal manner. This result provides
evidence that perirhinal cortex is engaged in conceptual representation.

built using attribute-based encryption; a key and novel feature of our
architecture, however, is that it is possible to remove access from a user

We achieve this by introducing a proxy that participates in the decryption
process and enforces revocation constraints. The proxy is minimally trusted and
cannot decrypt ciphertexts or provide access to previously revoked users. We

performance evaluation.We also describe an architecture for online social

viscoelasticity deviates from the single Maxwell behavior. The concentration
dependence of characteristic relaxation time and moduli is different in high
and low concentration cases. These results suggest that there are two different
concentration regimes. We expect that densely connected (well percolated)
networks are formed in high-concentration solutions, whereas sparsely connected
(weakly percolated) networks are formed in low-concentration solutions. We
propose single chain type transient network models to explain experimental
results. Our models incorporate the spatial correlation effect of micellar
cores and average number of elastically active chains per micellar core (the
network functionality). Our models can reproduce non-single Maxwellian
relaxation and nonlinear rheological behavior such as the shear thickening and
thinning. They are qualitatively consistent with experimental results. In our
models, the linear rheological behavior is mainly attributable to the
difference of network structures (functionalities). The nonlinear rheological

change in the sign of the magnetic hysteresis in the vicinity of the upper
critical field $H_{c2}$, from a clear diamagnetic response dominated by the
pinning of vortices, to a considerably smaller net hysteretic response of
opposite sign, which \emph{disappears} at $H_{c2}$. If the diamagnetic response
at high fields results from pinned vortices and associated screening
super-currents, this sign change must result from currents circulating in the
opposite sense, which give rise to a small field-dependent magnetic moment
\emph{below} $H_{c2}$. This behavior seems to be extremely sensitive to the
sample quality or stoichiometry, as we have observed it only in a few fresh
crystals, which also display the de Haas van Alphen-effect. We provide
arguments against the surface superconductivity, the flux compression, and the
random $\pi$ junction scenarios, which have been previously put forward to
explain a paramagnetic Meissner effect, below the lower critical field
$H_{c1}$. The observed anomalous hysteresis at high fields will be compatible
with the existence of chiral gap wave-functions, which possess a field
dependent magnetic moment. Within a Landau-Ginzburg framework, we demonstrate
how a $(d_{x^2 - y^2} + id_{xy})$ or a $(p_x+ip_y)$ chiral superconducting
component can be stabilized in the mixed state of $s_{\pm}$ superconductor, due
to the combined effects of the magnetic field and the presence of competing
pairing channels. The realization of a particular chiral pairing depends on the
microscopic details of the strengths of the competing pairing channels.

the radial distributions of the total baryonic mass, the gas mass, and the O/H
abundance. From observations, we find that the total baryonic mass profile in
M33 has a double exponential behavior, decreasing exponentially for r<= 6 kpc,
and increasing lightly for r > 6 kpc due to the increase of the gas mass
surface density. To adopt a concordant set of stellar and H II regions O/H
values, we had to correct the latter for the effect of temperature variations
and O dust depletion. Our best model shows a good agreement with the observed
the radial distributions of: the SFR, the stellar mass, C/H, N/H, Ne/H, Mg/H,
Si/H, P/H, S/H, Ar/H, Fe/H,and Z. According to our model, the star formation
efficiency is constant in time and space for r <= 6 kpc, but the SFR efficiency
decreases with time and galactocentric distance for r > 6 kpc. The reduction of
the SFR efficiency occurs earlier at higher r. While the galaxy follows the
inside-out formation scenario for all r, the stars follow the inside-out

other, then they lie in the same automorphism orbit. The proof is based on
techniques that were developed by Kaplansky and Mackey in order to give an
elegant proof of Ulm's theorem. Similar results hold for reduced countably
generated torsion modules over principal ideal domains. It is shown that the
depth and the description of atoms of the resulting poset of orbits of tuples
depend only on the Ulm invariants of the module in question (and not on the
underlying ring). A complete description of the poset of orbits of elements in
terms of the Ulm invariants of the module is given. The relationship between
this description of orbits and a very different-looking one obtained by Dutta
and Prasad for torsion modules of bounded order is explained.

environments, e.g., cytoskeletal networks, stretched DNAs in chromatin. It is
of paramount importance to understand quantitatively how they, utilizing their
flexibility, optimally respond to a minute signal, which is, in general,
temporally fluctuating far away from equilibrium. To this end, we analytically
study viscoelastic response and associated stochastic resonance in a stretched
single semi-flexible chain to an oscillatory force or electric field. Including
hydrodynamic interactions between chain segments, we evaluate dynamics of the
polymer extension in coherent response to the force or field. We find power
amplification factor of the response at a noise-strength (temperature) can
attain the maximum that grows as the chain length increases, indicative of an
entropic stochastic resonance (ESR). In particular for a charged chain under an
electric field, we find that the maximum also occurs at an optimal chain
length, a new feature of ESR. The hydrodynamic interaction is found to enhance
the power amplification, representing unique polymer cooperativity which the
fluid background imparts despite its overdamping nature. For the slow
oscillatory force, the resonance behavior is explained by the chain undulation
of the longest wavelength. This novel ESR phenomenon suggests how a biopolymer
self-organizes in an overdamping environment, utilizing its flexibility and
thermal fluctuations.

In particular, those coordinates whose magnitude is below the machine precision

  It turns out that, under certain conditions, frequently ecountered in

exponential in the size of the Finite State Automaton (FSA) computing the

  In this work we are interested in efficient computation in the above model,
at the expense of minimal additional assumptions. Relying on the existence of
one-way functions, we show how to process a priori unbounded inputs (but of
course, polynomial in the security parameter) at a cost linear in $m$, the

  * In the case of $(n,n)$-reconstruction (i.e. in which all $n$ agents
participate in reconstruction of the distributed computation) and at most $n-1$
agents are corrupted, the agent storage, the time required to process each
input symbol and the time complexity for reconstruction are all $O(mn)$.
  * In the case of $(t+1,n)$-reconstruction (where only $t+1$ agents take part
in the reconstruction) and at most $t$ agents are corrupted, the agents'
storage and time required to process each input symbol are $O(m{n-1 \choose
t-1})$. The complexity of reconstruction is $O(m(t+1))$.

processes on two-lane systems with open boundaries. We have considered two
distinct two-lane systems. In the first, particles hop on the lanes in one
direction obeying exclusion principle and there is no exchange of particles
between the lanes. The hopping on one lane is affected by the particle
occupancies on the other, which thereby introduces an indirect interaction
among the lanes. Through a phase plane analysis of the boundary layer equation,
we show why the bulk density undergoes a sharp change as the interaction
between the lanes is increased. The second system involves one lane with driven
exclusion process and the other with biased diffusion of particles. In contrast
to the previous model, here there is a direct interaction between the lanes due
to particle exchange between them. In this model, we have looked at two
possible scenarios with constant (flat) and non-constant bulk profiles. The
fixed point based boundary layer method provides a new perspective on several
aspects including those related to maximal/minimal current phases,
possibilities of shocks under very restricted boundary conditions for the flat

minimum number of single spin errors that could cause error correction to fail.
However, the success thresholds of finite per-qubit error rate that have been
proven for the likes of the Toric code require them to work well beyond this
limit. We argue that without the assumption of being below the distance limit,
the success of error correction is not only contingent on the noise model, but
what the noise model is believed to be. Any discrepancy must adversely affect
the threshold rate, and risks invalidating existing threshold theorems. We
prove that for the 2D Toric code, suitable thresholds still exist by utilising
a mapping to the 2D random bond Ising model.

filling are of intense current interest and debate. We study this issue using
the singular-mode functional renormalization group theory. We discover a rich
variety of electronic instabilities under short range interactions. With
increasing on-site repulsion $U$, the system develops successively
ferromagnetism, intra unit-cell antiferromagnetism, and charge bond order. With
nearest-neighbor Coulomb interaction $V$ alone (U=0), the system develops
intra-unit-cell charge density wave order for small $V$, s-wave
superconductivity for moderate $V$, and the charge density wave order appears
again for even larger $V$. With both $U$ and $V$, we also find spin bond order
and chiral $d_{x^2 - y^2} + i d_{xy}$ superconductivity in some particular
regimes of the phase diagram. We find that the s-wave superconductivity is a
result of charge density wave fluctuations and the squared logarithmic
divergence in the pairing susceptibility. On the other hand, the d-wave
superconductivity follows from bond order fluctuations that avoid the matrix
element effect. The phase diagram is vastly different from that in honeycomb
lattices because of the geometrical frustration in the Kagome lattice.

of rotating stars, like angular momentum and chemicals transport, with
classical chemical evolution, gravitational contraction or mass-loss. Such
modelling needs to be achieved in two dimensions, combining the calculation of
the structure of the star, its mean flows and the time-evolution of the whole.
We present here a first step in this challenging programme. It leads to the
first self-consistent two-dimensional models of rotating stars in a steady
state generated by the ESTER code. In these models the structure (pressure,
density and temperature) and the flow fields are computed in a self-consistent
way allowing the prediction of the differential rotation and the associated
meridian circulation of the stars. After a presentation of the physical
properties of such models and the numerical methods at work, we give the first

polarization produced by scattering processes in strong UV lines, such as the
hydrogen Ly$\alpha$ line. The interpretation of the observed Stokes profiles
will require taking into account that the outer solar atmosphere is highly
structured and dynamic, and that the height of the transition region may well
vary from one place in the atmosphere to another. Here we report on the
Ly$\alpha$ scattering polarization signals we have calculated in a realistic

radiation MHD simulation. This model is characterized by spatially complex
variations of the physical quantities at transition region heights. The results
of our investigation lead us to emphasize that scattering processes in the
upper solar chromosphere should indeed produce measurable linear polarization
in Ly$\alpha$. More importantly, we show that via the Hanle effect the model's
magnetic field produces significant changes in the emergent $Q/I$ and $U/I$
profiles. Therefore, we argue that by measuring the polarization signals
produced by scattering processes and the Hanle effect in Ly$\alpha$ and
contrasting them with those computed in increasingly realistic atmospheric

structure of the upper chromosphere and transition region of the Sun.

therefore not even arithmetical. We also define a natural and comprehensive
class C of geometric structures (T,\beta), where T is a subset of R^2, and show
that for each structure (T,\beta) in C, the FO-theory of the class of monadic

addition to decidability questions, we briefly study the expressivity of
universal MSO and weak universal MSO over expansions of (R^n,\beta). While the

weak universal MSO translate into equivalent formulae of universal MSO.

flows under consideration for the laboratory magnetic dynamos. Recent
experiments have shown that such flows may excite Coriolis restored inertial
modes. The present work aims to better understand the properties of the
observed modes and the nature of their excitation. Using numerical solutions
describing forced inertial modes of a uniformly rotating fluid inside a
spherical shell, we first identify the observed oscillations of the Couette
flow with non-axisymmetric, retrograde, equatorially anti-symmetric inertial
modes, confirming first attempts using a full sphere model. Although the model
has no differential rotation, identification is possible because a large
fraction of the fluid in a spherical Couette flow rotates rigidly. From the
observed sequence of the excited modes appearing when the inner sphere is
slowed down by step, we identify a critical Rossby number associated with a
given mode and below which it is excited. The matching between this critical
number and the one derived from the phase velocity of the numerically computed
modes shows that these modes are excited by an instability likely driven by the
critical layer that develops in the shear layer staying along the tangent
cylinder of the inner sphere.

represented by a set of random effects, which are modelled with a conditional
autoregressive (CAR) prior. Such priors include a global spatial smoothing
parameter, whereas real risk surfaces are likely to include areas of smooth
evolution as well as discontinuities, the latter of which are known as risk
boundaries. Therefore, this paper proposes an extension to the class of CAR
priors, which can identify both areas of localised spatial smoothness and risk
boundaries. However, allowing for this localised smoothing requires large
numbers of correlation parameters to be estimated, which are unlikely to be
well identified from the data. To address this problem we propose eliciting an
informative prior about the locations of such boundaries, which can be combined
with the information from the data to provide more precise posterior inference.
We test our approach by simulation, before applying it to a study of the risk
of emergency admission to hospital in Greater Glasgow, Scotland.

leading to the formation of planetesimals of kilometre size. A promising
scenario involves the existence of vortices able to concentrate a large amount
of dust and grains in their centres. Up to now this scenario has been studied
mostly in 2D razor thin disks. A 3D study including, simultaneously, the
formation and resulting dust concentration of the vortices with vertical
settling, was still missing. The Rossby wave instability self-consistently
forms 3D vortices, which have the unique quality of presenting a large scale
vertical velocity in their centre. Here we aim to study how this newly
discovered effect can alter the dynamic evolution of the dust. We perform
global 3D simulations of the RWI in a radially and vertically stratified disk
using the code MPI-AMRVAC. After the growth phase of the instability, the gas
and solid phases are modelled by a bi-fluid approach, where the dust is
considered as a fluid without pressure. Both the drag force of the gas on the
dust and the back-reaction of the dust on the gas are included. Multiple grain
sizes from 1mm to 5cm are used with a constant density distribution. We obtain
in a short timescale a high concentration of the largest grains in the
vortices. Indeed, in 3 rotations the dust-to-gas density ratio grows from 10^-2
to unity leading to a concentration of mass up to that of Mars in one vortex.
The presence of the radial drift is also at the origin of a dust pile-up at the
radius of the vortices. Lastly, the vertical velocity of the gas in the vortex
causes the sedimentation process to be reversed, the mm size dust is lifted and
higher concentrations are obtained in the upper layer than in the mid-plane.

the book, focussing on d-manifolds without boundary, is arXiv:1206.4207, and
readers just wanting a general overview are advised to start there.
  We introduce a 2-category dMan of ""d-manifolds"", new geometric objects which
are 'derived' smooth manifolds, in the sense of the 'derived algebraic
geometry' of Toen and Lurie. They are a 2-category truncation of Spivak's
'derived manifolds' (see arXiv:0810.5174, arXiv:1212.1153). The category of
manifolds Man embeds in dMan as a full (2-)subcategory. We also define
2-categories dMan^b,dMan^c of ""d-manifolds with boundary"" and ""d-manifolds with
corners"", and orbifold versions of these dOrb,dOrb^b,dOrb^c, ""d-orbifolds"".
Much of differential geometry extends very nicely to d-manifolds and
d-orbifolds -- immersions, submersions, submanifolds, transverse fibre
products, orientations, orbifold strata, bordism, etc. Compact oriented
d-manifolds and d-orbifolds have virtual classes.
  There are truncation functors to d-manifolds and d-orbifolds from essentially
every geometric structure on moduli spaces used in enumerative invariant
problems in differential geometry or complex algebraic geometry, including
Fredholm sections of Banach vector bundles over Banach manifolds, the
""Kuranishi spaces"" of Fukaya, Oh, Ohta and Ono and the ""polyfolds"" of Hofer,
Wysocki and Zehnder in symplectic geometry, and C-schemes with perfect
obstruction theories in algebraic geometry. Thus, results in the literature
imply that many important classes of moduli spaces are d-manifolds or
d-orbifolds, including moduli spaces of J-holomorphic curves in symplectic
geometry.
  D-manifolds and d-orbifolds will have applications in symplectic geometry,
and elsewhere.

peculiar features: (i) they originate from jets whose initial virtuality and
energy are of the same order; (ii) such jets are rare and have a very biased
energy sharing among the particles, namely, the detected hadron carries the
main fraction of the jet energy. The former feature leads to an extremely
intensive gluon radiation and energy dissipation at the early stage of
hadronization, either in vacuum or in a medium. As a result, a leading hadron
must be produced on a short length scale. Evaluation within a model of
perturbative fragmentation confirms the shortness of the production length.
This result is at variance with the unjustified assumption of long production
length, made within the popular energy loss scenario. Thus we conclude that the
main reason of suppression of high-pT hadrons in heavy ion collisions is the
controlled by color transparency attenuation of a high-pT dipole propagating
through the hot medium. Adjusting a single parameter, the transport
coefficient, we describe quite well the data from LHC and RHIC for the
suppression factor R_{AA} as function of pT, collision energy and centrality.
We observe that the complementary effect of initial state interaction causes a
flattening and even fall of R_{AA} at large pT. The azimuthal anisotropy of
hadron production, calculated with no further adjustment, also agrees well with
data at different energies and centralities.

differentiate features within a 3-D data cube (longitude, latitude, radial
velocity) and to parameterize individual coherent structures. We compiled an HI
object catalog of LA objects within an area of 70 degr x 85 degr (1.6 sr) of
the LA region. This catalog comprises information of location, column density,
line width, shape and asymmetries of the individual LA objects above the
4-sigma threshold of Delta T_b simeq 200 mK. We present evidence of a fourth
arm segment (LA4). For all LA objects we find an inverse correlation of
velocities v_GSR in Galactic Standard of Rest frame with Magellanic longitude.
High-mass objects tend to have higher radial velocities than low-mass ones.
About 1/4 of all LA objects can be characterized as head-tail (HT) structures.
Using image recognition with objective criteria, it is feasible to isolate most
of LA emission from the diffuse Milky Way HI gas. Some blended gas components
(we estimate 5%) escape detection, but we find a total gas content of the LA
that is about 50% higher than previously assumed. These methods allow the
deceleration of the LA clouds to be traced towards the Milky Way disk by drag
forces. The derived velocity gradient strongly supports the assumption that the
whole LA originates entirely in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). LA4 is
observed opposite to LA1, and we propose that both arms are related, spanning
about 52kpc in space. HT structures trace drag forces even at tens of kpc

surrounding a super-massive black hole and a central accretion disk. The
dissipative force acting on stars in the disk leads to an enhanced mass flow
towards the super-massive black hole and to an asymmetry in the phase space
distribution due to the rotating accretion disk. The accretion disk is
considered as a stationary Keplerian rotating disk, which is vertically
extended in order to employ a fully self-consistent treatment of stellar
dynamics including the dissipative force originating from star-gas ram pressure
effects. The stellar system is treated with a direct high-accuracy N-body
integration code. A star-by-star representation, desirable in N-body
simulations, cannot be extended to real particle numbers yet. Hence, we
carefully discuss the scaling behavior of our model with regard to particle
number and tidal accretion radius. The main idea is to find a family of models
for which the ratio of two-body relaxation time and dissipation time (for
kinetic energy of stellar orbits) is constant, which then allows us to
extrapolate our results to real parameters of galactic nuclei. Our model is
derived from basic physical principles and as such it provides insight into the
role of physical processes in galactic nuclei, but it should be regarded as a
first step towards more realistic and more comprehensive simulations.
Nevertheless, the following conclusions appear to be robust: the star accretion
rate onto the accretion disk and subsequently onto the super-massive black hole
is enhanced by a significant factor compared to purely stellar dynamical
systems neglecting the disk. This process leads to enhanced fueling of central
disks in active galactic nuclei and to an enhanced rate of tidal stellar
disruptions. [Abridged]

composition of protoplanetary disks are affected by the incident radiation
field at optical, FUV, and X-ray wavelengths, as well as by the dust
properties.
  Aims. The effect of FUV and X-rays on the disk structure and the gas chemical
composition are investigated. This work forms the basis of a second paper,
which discusses the impact on diagnostic lines of, e.g., C+, O, H2O, and Ne+
observed with facilities such as Spitzer and Herschel.
  Methods. A grid of 240 models is computed in which the X-ray and FUV
luminosity, minimum grain size, dust size distribution, and surface density
distribution are varied in a systematic way. The hydrostatic structure and the
thermo-chemical structure are calculated using ProDiMo.
  Results. The abundance structure of neutral oxygen is stable to changes in
the X-ray and FUV luminosity, and the emission lines will thus be useful
tracers of the disk mass and temperature. The C+ abundance distribution is
sensitive to both X-rays and FUV. The radial column density profile shows two
peaks, one at the inner rim and a second one at a radius r=5-10 AU. Ne+ and
other heavy elements have a very strong response to X-rays, and the column
density in the inner disk increases by two orders of magnitude from the lowest
(LX = 1e29 erg/s) to the highest considered X-ray flux (LX = 1e32 erg/s). FUV
confines the Ne+ ionized region to areas closer to the star at low X-ray
luminosities (LX = 1e29 erg/s). H2O abundances are enhanced by X-rays due to
higher temperatures in the inner disk and higher ionization fractions in the
outer disk. The line fluxes and profiles are affected by the effects on these
species, thus providing diagnostic value in the study of FUV and X-ray
irradiated disks around T Tauri stars. (abridged)

evolved within quantum physics. We begin by reviewing Shannon's information
theory and its first application in quantum physics, due to Everett, in
explaining the information conveyed during a quantum measurement. This
naturally leads us to Lindblad's information theoretic analysis of quantum
measurements and his emphasis of the difference between the classical and
quantum mutual information. After briefly summarising the quantification of
entanglement using these and related ideas, we arrive at the concept of quantum
discord that naturally captures the boundary between entanglement and classical
correlations. Finally we discuss possible links between discord and the
generation of correlations in thermodynamic transformations of coupled harmonic
oscillators.

with the mutual information $I$ between the two parts after a local measurement

entanglement measured in its ground state at the critical point is known to
obey a certain scaling form. Surprisingly, the mutual information of classical
spin configurations is found to obey the same scaling form, although with a
different prefactor. Moreover, we find that mutual information and the
entanglement obey the inequality $I\leq E$ in the ground state as well as in a
dynamically evolving situation. This inequality holds for general bipartite
systems in a pure state and can be proven using similar techniques as for
Holevo's bound.

Bohr's reply, one can appreciate that both arguments were technically correct.
Their opposed conclusions about the completeness of quantum mechanics hinged
upon an explicit difference in their criteria for when a measurement on Alice's
system can be regarded as not disturbing Bob's system. The EPR criteria allow
their conclusion (incompletness) to be reached by establishing the physical
reality of just a single observable $q$ (not a conjugate pair $q$ and $p$), but
I show that Bohr's definition of disturbance prevents the EPR chain of
reasoning from establishing even this. Moreover, I show that Bohr's definition
is intimately related to the asymmetric concept of quantum discord from quantum
information theory: if and only if the joint state has no Alice-discord, she
can measure any observable without disturbing (in Bohr's sense) Bob's system.
Discord can be present even when systems are unentangled, and this has
implications for our understanding of the historical development of notions of
quantum nonlocality.

bounds are obtained. The first bound is rather easy to be obtained since the
needed condition, equivalent to uniform ergodicity, is imposed on the
transition matrix directly. The second bound, which holds for a general
(possibly periodic) Markov chain, involves finding a drift function. This drift
function is closely related with the mean first hitting times. Some
$V$-norm-wise bounds are also derived based on the results in Kartashov (1986).
Moreover, we show how the bounds developed in this paper and one bound given in
Seneta (1988) can be extended to continuous-time Markov chains. Several
examples are shown to illustrate our results or to compare our bounds with the

of gauge quantum field theories, such as quantum chromodynamics, by discussing
a famous physical limit, the 't Hooft limit, in which the theory concerned
often simplifies.
  The idea of the limit is that the number $N$ of colours (or charges) goes to
infinity. The simplifications that can happen in this limit, and that we will
consider, are: (i) the theory's Feynman diagrams can be drawn on a plane
without lines intersecting (called `planarity'); and (ii) the theory, or a
sector of it, becomes integrable, and indeed corresponds to a well-studied
system, viz. a spin chain. Planarity is important because it shows how a
quantum field theory can exhibit extended, in particular string-like,
structures; in some cases, this gives a connection with string theory, and thus
with gravity.
  Previous philosophical literature about how one theory (or a sector, or
regime, of a theory) might be emergent from, and-or reduced to, another one has
tended to emphasize cases, such as occur in statistical mechanics, where the
system before the limit has finitely many degrees of freedom. But here, our
quantum field theories, including those on the way to the 't Hooft limit, will
have infinitely many degrees of freedom.
  Nevertheless, we will show how a recent schema by Butterfield and taxonomy by
Norton apply to the quantum field theories we consider; and we will classify
three physical properties of our theories in these terms. These properties are
planarity and integrability, as in (i) and (ii) above; and the behaviour of the
beta-function reflecting, for example, asymptotic freedom.
  Our discussion of these properties, especially the beta-function, will also
relate to recent philosophical debate about the propriety of assessing quantum
field theories, whose rigorous existence is not yet proven.

in this latent variable setting; we propose a penalty that automatically adapts
to the number of states $K$ and the state-specific sample sizes and can cope
with scaling issues arising from the unknown states. The methodology is
adaptive and very general, applying in particular to both low- and

approach facilitates exploration of the number of states $K$ by coupling
estimation for successive candidate values $K$. Empirical results on simulated

mixing, is studied by means of the field theoretic renormalization group.
Namely, relaxational stochastic dynamics of a non-conserved order parameter of
the Ashkin-Teller-Potts model, coupled to a random velocity field with
prescribed statistics, is considered. The mixing is modelled by Kraichnan's
rapid-change ensemble: time-decorrelated Gaussian velocity field with the
power-like spectrum $\propto k^{-d-\xi}$. It is shown that, depending on the
symmetry group of the underlying Potts model, the degree of compressibility and
the relation between the exponent $\xi$ and the space dimension $d$, the system
exhibits various types of infrared (long-time, large-scale) scaling behaviour,
associated with four different infrared attractors of the renormalization group
equations. In addition to known asymptotic regimes (equilibrium dynamics of the
Potts model and the passively advected scalar field), existence of a new,
strongly non-equilibrium type of critical behaviour is established. That
""full-scale"" regime corresponds to the novel type of critical behaviour
(universality class), where the self-interaction of the order parameter and the
turbulent mixing are equally important. The corresponding critical dimensions
depend on $d$, $\xi$, the symmetry group and the degree of compressibility. The
dimensions and the regions of stability for all the regimes are calculated in
the leading order of the double expansion in two parameters $\xi$ and
$\varepsilon=6-d$. Special attention is paid to the effects of compressibility
of the fluid, because they lead to nontrivial qualitative crossover phenomena.

observed excesses of nuclear recoil events, while the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has
a long standing annual modulation signal. It has been suggested that these
excesses may be due to light mass, m_chi ~ 5-10 GeV, WIMPs. The Earth's motion
with respect to the Galactic rest frame leads to a directional dependence in
the WIMP scattering rate, providing a powerful signal of the Galactic origin of
any recoil excess. We investigate whether direct detection experiments with
directional sensitivity have the potential to observe this anisotropic
scattering rate with the elastically scattering light WIMPs proposed to explain
the observed excesses. We find that the number of recoils required to detect an
anisotropic signal from light WIMPs at 5 sigma significance varies from 7 to
more than 190 over the set of target nuclei and energy thresholds expected for
directional detectors. Smaller numbers arise from configurations where the
detector is only sensitive to recoils from the highest speed, and hence most
anisotropic, WIMPs. However, the event rate above threshold is very small in
these cases, leading to the need for large experimental exposures to accumulate
even a small number of events. To account for this sensitivity to the tail of
the WIMP velocity distribution, whose shape is not well known, we consider two
exemplar halo models spanning the range of possibilities. We also note that for
an accurate calculation the Earth's orbital speed must be averaged over. We
find that the exposures required to detect 10 GeV WIMPs at a WIMP-proton
cross-section of 10^-4 pb are of order 10^3 kg day for a 20 keV energy
threshold, within reach of planned directional detectors. Lower WIMP masses
require higher exposures and/or lower energy thresholds for detection.

alternating fields to the particles, whose average Lorentz factor increases by
a factor of sigma with respect to the pre-shock value. In the limit
lambda/(r_L*sigma)>>1, where r_L is the relativistic Larmor radius in the wind,
the post-shock particle spectrum approaches a flat power-law tail with slope
around -1.5, populated by particles accelerated by the reconnection electric

monitoring system, which not only keeps track of all the energy coming in from
diverse sources but also can detect where energy is needed through a two-way
communication system that collects data about how and when consumers use power.
It is safer in many ways, compared with the current one-directional power
supply system that seems susceptible to either sabotage or natural disasters,
including being more resistant to attack and power outages. In such an
autonomic and advanced-grid environment, investing in a pilot study and knowing
the nation readiness to adopt a smart grid absolves the government of complex
intervention from any failure to bring Japan into the autonomic-grid
environment. This paper looks closely into the concept of the Japanese
government go green effort, the objective of which is to make Japan a leading
nation in environmental and energy sustainability through green innovation,
such as creating a low-carbon society and embracing the natural grid community.
This paper paints a clearer conceptual picture of how Japan smart grid effort
compares with that of the US.

eigenfunctions of a Sturm-Liouville problem with discontinuities at two points.
The problem contains an eigenparameter in the one of boundary conditions. For
operator-theoretic formulation of the considered problem we define an
equivalent inner product in the Hilbert space and suitable self-adjoint lineer
operator in it.
