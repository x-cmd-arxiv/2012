undergraduate (UG) class to formulate a relativistically extended Kinetic
Theory of Gases and thermal speed distribution, while assuming the basic
thermal symmetry arguments of the famous Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as
presented at the UG level. The adopted framework can be used by students to
understand the physics in a thermally governed system at high temperature and
speeds, without having to indulge in high level tensor based mathematics, as
has been done by the previous works in the subject. Our approach, a logical
extension of that proposed by Maxwell, will first recapitulate what is taught
and known in the UG class and then present a methodology inspired from the
Maxwell-Boltzmann framework that will help students to understand and derive
the physics of relativistic thermal systems. The methodology uses simple tools
well known to undergraduates and involves a component of computational
techniques that can be used to involve students in this exercise. We have tried
to place the current work in a larger perspective in regard to the earlier
works done and emphasize on it's simplicity and accessibility to students.
Towards the end, interesting implications of the relativistically extended
distribution are presented and compared with the Maxwell-Boltzmann results at
various temperatures.

exhibiting a quantum phase transition between its superfluid (SF) and
Mott-insulator (MI) phase. Unlike in higher dimensions the phase diagram of the
BHM in one dimension possesses regions in which increasing the hopping
amplitude can result in a transition from MI to SF and then back to a MI. This
type of re-entrance is well known in classical systems like liquid crystals yet
its origin in quantum systems is still not well understood. Moreover, this
unusual re-entrant character of the BHM is not easily captured in approximate
analytical or numerical calculations. Here we study in detail the predictions
of three different and widely used approximations; a multi-site mean-field
decoupling, a finite-sized cluster calculation, and a real-space
renormalization group (RG) approach. It is found that mean-field calculations
do not reproduce re-entrance while finite-sized clusters display a precursor to
re-entrance. Here we show for the first time that RG does capture the
re-entrant feature and constitutes one of the simplest approximation able to do
so. The differing abilities of these approaches reveals the importance of
describing short-ranged correlations relevant to the kinetic energy of a MI in

expression data is an important and challenging problem in systems biology.
Existing algorithms produce networks that either have undirected and unweighted
edges, or else are constrained to contain no cycles, both of which are
biologically unrealistic. In the present paper we propose a new algorithm,
based on a concept from probability theory known as the phi-mixing coefficient,
that produces networks whose edges are weighted and directed, and are permitted
to contain cycles. Because there is no ""ground truth"" for genome-wide networks
on a human scale, we analyzed the outcomes of several experiments on lung
cancer, and matched the predictions from the inferred networks with
experimental results. Specifically, we inferred three networks (NSCLC,
Neuro-endocrine NSCLC plus SCLC, and normal) from the gene expression
measurements of 157 lung cancer and 59 normal cell lines, compared with the
outcomes of siRNA screening of 19,000+ genes on 11 NSCLC cell lines, and
analyzed data from a ChIP-Seq experiment to determine putative downstream
targets of the lineage specific oncogenic transcription factor ASCL1. The
inferred networks displayed a scale-free or power law behavior between the
degree of a node and the number of nodes with that degree. There was a strong
correlation between the degree of a gene in the inferred NSCLC network and its
essentiality for the survival of the cells. The inferred downstream
neighborhood genes of ASCL1 in the SCLC network were significantly enriched by
ChIP-Seq determined putative target genes, while no such enrichment was found
in the inferred NSCLC network.

reproduces the low ionization absorption kinematics, suggesting gas coupled to

conclude that although the quasar sight-line passes along the galaxy minor axis

suggestive of dark matter annihilation in the galactic center and other dark
matter-dominated regions. If the Fermi feature is indeed due to dark matter
annihilation, the best-fit line cross-section, together with the lack of any
corresponding excess in continuum photons, poses an interesting puzzle for
models of thermal dark matter: the line cross-section is too large to be
generated radiatively from open Standard Model annihilation modes, and too
small to provide efficient dark matter annihilation in the early universe. We
discuss two mechanisms to solve this puzzle and illustrate each with a simple
reference model in which the dominant dark matter annihilation channel is
photonic final states. The first mechanism we employ is resonant annihilation,
which enhances the annihilation cross-section during freezeout and allows for a
sufficiently large present-day annihilation cross section. Second, we consider
cascade annihilation, with a hierarchy between p-wave and s-wave processes.
Both mechanisms require mass near-degeneracies and predict states with masses
closely related to the dark matter mass; resonant freezeout in addition
requires new charged particles at the TeV scale.

what extent the asymmetry can be enhanced by suitable phase space cuts and, in

central jets without an excessive reduction of the cross section. By applying
additional kinematical cuts, the asymmetry can be enhanced to -4%, but at the
cost of a strong reduction of the cross section. Massive color-octet states can
generate sizeable effects in top pair + jet production, both on the charge
asymmetry and on the cross section. The charge asymmetry probes both vector and
axial-vector couplings to quarks. We show that massive color octets can
generate asymmetries up to +-10% for moderate and up to +-30% for strong

combining samples acquired at different times and observing frequencies.
However, astrophysical sources often contain complicated spatial structure that
varies within the time-range of an observation, or the bandwidth of the
receiver being used, or both. Image reconstruction algorithms can been designed
to model time and frequency variability in addition to the average intensity
distribution, and provide an improvement over traditional methods that ignore
all variability. This paper describes an algorithm designed for such
structures, and evaluates it in the context of reconstructing three-dimensional
time-varying structures in the solar corona from radio interferometric
measurements between 5 GHz and 15 GHz using existing telescopes such as the
EVLA and at angular resolutions better than that allowed by traditional

compositions, and (3) mis-characterize the optical/UV absorption by assuming
that scattered photons are lost to the observer. The primary consequences for
the progenitor of SN2012aw are that both the luminosity and the absorption are
significantly over-estimated. In particular, the stellar luminosity is most
likely in the range 10^4.8 < L/Lsun < 10^5.0 and the star was not extremely
massive for a Type IIP progenitor, with M < 15Msun. Given the properties of the
circumstellar dust and the early X-ray/radio detections of SN2012aw, the star
was probably obscured by an on-going wind with Mdot ~ 10^-5.5 to 10^-5.0
Msun/year at the time of the explosion, roughly consistent with the expected
mass loss rates for a star of its temperature (T_* ~ 3600K) and luminosity. In
the spirit of Galactic extinction laws, we supply simple interpolation formulas
for circumstellar extinction by dusty graphitic and silicate shells as a
function of wavelength (>0.3 micron) and total (absorption plus scattering)
V-band optical depth (tau < 20). These do not include the contributions of dust
emission, but provide a simple, physical alternative to incorrectly using

is the development of causal discovery algorithms, the purpose of which is to
infer the causal relations that hold among a set of variables from the
correlations that these exhibit. We apply some of these algorithms to the
correlations that arise for entangled quantum systems. We show that they cannot
distinguish correlations that satisfy Bell inequalities from correlations that
violate Bell inequalities, and consequently that they cannot do justice to the
challenges of explaining certain quantum correlations causally. Nonetheless, by
adapting the conceptual tools of causal inference, we can show that any attempt
to provide a causal explanation of nonsignalling correlations that violate a
Bell inequality must contradict a core principle of these algorithms, namely,
that an observed statistical independence between variables should not be
explained by fine-tuning of the causal parameters. In particular, we
demonstrate the need for such fine-tuning for most of the causal mechanisms
that have been proposed to underlie Bell correlations, including superluminal
causal influences, superdeterminism (that is, a denial of freedom of choice of
settings), and retrocausal influences which do not introduce causal cycles.

diversity in their properties than in the optical. Using a stationary
Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code, a grid of spectra at maximum light was
created varying bolometric luminosity and the amount of metals in the outer
layers of the SN ejecta. This model grid is then compared to a sample of
high-redshift SNe Ia in order to test whether the observed diversities can be
explained by luminosity and metallicity changes alone. The dispersion in
broadband UV flux and colours at approximately constant optical spectrum can be
readily matched by the model grid. In particular, the UV1-b colour is found to
be a good tracer of metal content of the outer ejecta, which may in turn
reflect on the metallicity of the SN progenitor. The models are less successful
in reproducing other observed trends, such as the wavelengths of key UV
features, which are dominated by reverse fluorescence photons from the optical,
or intermediate band photometric indices. This can be explained in terms of the
greater sensitivity of these detailed observables to modest changes in the
relative abundances. Specifically, no single element is responsible for the
observed trends. Due to their complex origin, these trends do not appear to be
good indicators of either luminosity or metallicity.

binary formation, assuming a homogeneous background density, suspect. In a
previous paper, we have found that indeed the conventional wisdom of binary
formation, based on three-body encounters, is incorrect. Here we refine that
insight, by further dissecting the subsequent steps leading to hard binary
formation. For this purpose, we add some analysis tools in order to make the
study less subjective. We find that the conventional treatment does remain
valid for direct three-body scattering, but fails for resonant three-body
scattering. Especially democratic resonance scattering, which forms an
important part of the analytical theory of three-body binary formation, takes
too much space and time to be approximated as being isolated, in the context of
a cluster core around core collapse. We conclude that, while three-body
encounters can be analytically approximated as isolated, subsequent strong
perturbations typically occur whenever those encounters give rise to democratic
resonances. We present analytical estimates postdicting our numerical results.
If we only had been a bit more clever, we could have predicted this qualitative

medium (ISM) and its connections to the star formation (SF) process. The ISM is
turbulent, magnetized, self-gravitating, and is subject to heating and cooling
processes that control its thermodynamic behavior. The turbulence in the warm
and hot ionized components of the ISM appears to be trans- or subsonic, and
thus to behave nearly incompressibly. However, the neutral warm and cold
components are highly compressible, as a consequence of both thermal
instability in the atomic gas and of moderately-to-strongly supersonic motions
in the roughly isothermal cold atomic and molecular components. Within this
context, we discuss: i) the production and statistical distribution of
turbulent density fluctuations in both isothermal and polytropic media; ii) the
nature of the clumps produced by thermal instability, noting that, contrary to
classical ideas, they in general accrete mass from their environment; iii) the
density-magnetic field correlation (or lack thereof) in turbulent density
fluctuations, as a consequence of the superposition of the different wave modes
in the turbulent flow; iv) the evolution of the mass-to-magnetic flux ratio
(MFR) in density fluctuations as they are built up by dynamic compressions; v)
the formation of cold, dense clouds aided by thermal instability; vi) the
expectation that star-forming molecular clouds are likely to be undergoing
global gravitational contraction, rather than being near equilibrium, and vii)
the regulation of the star formation rate (SFR) in such gravitationally
contracting clouds by stellar feedback which, rather than keeping the clouds
from collapsing, evaporates and diperses them while they collapse.

the optical luminosities of their host galaxies indicate that they are drawn

are systematically bluer than those of comparably massive galaxies at the same
redshift. The host galaxies of the radio-loud quasars (RLQ) in our sample are
more luminous than their radio-quiet quasar (RQQ) counterparts at each epoch,
but have indistinguishable colours, confirming that the RLQ's are drawn from
only the most massive galaxies (10^{11}-10^{12} M_sun, even at z~2), while the
RQQ's are slightly less massive (~10^{11} M_sun). This is consistent with the
well-known anticorrelation between radio-loudness and accretion rate. Using
simple stellar population ""frosting"" models we estimate mean star formation
rates of ~350 M_sun/yr for the RLQ's and ~100 M_sun/yr for the RQQ's at z~2. By
z~1, these rates have fallen to ~150 M_sun/yr for the RLQ's and ~50 M_sun/yr

mechanically compatible and electrically neutral FDWs in rhombohedral BaTiO3
are of 71-degree, 109-degree, and 180-degree type. We have investigated these
FDWs based both on first-principles calculations and on a

competition between the energies of Bloch and Ising FDWs can be discussed in
terms of a picture in which a Bloch wall is regarded as being composed of a
pair of smaller-angle Ising ones. A reduction by 40% in the parameters
describing the gradient term in the GLD model brings it into better agreement
with the first-principles results for detailed properties such as the energies
and widths of the FDWs.

publishing social-network graphs is considered an ill-advised practice due to
privacy concerns. To alleviate this problem, several anonymization methods have
been proposed, aiming at reducing the risk of a privacy breach on the published
data, while still allowing to analyze them and draw relevant conclusions. In
this paper we introduce a new anonymization approach that is based on injecting
uncertainty in social graphs and publishing the resulting uncertain graphs.
While existing approaches obfuscate graph data by adding or removing edges
entirely, we propose using a finer-grained perturbation that adds or removes
edges partially: this way we can achieve the same desired level of obfuscation
with smaller changes in the data, thus maintaining higher utility. Our
experiments on real-world networks confirm that at the same level of identity

in this satellite of the Milky Way. One object is kinematically cold with a
velocity dispersion of $4.25 \pm 0.75\ \kms$ and centered at $(9.1\arcmin \pm
1.5, 7.2\arcmin \pm 1.2)$ in relative RA and DEC with respect to the center of
Ursa Minor. The second object has a large velocity offset of
$-12.8^{+1.75}_{-1.5}\ \kms$ compared to Ursa Minor and centered at
$(-14.0\arcmin^{+2.4}_{-5.8}, -2.5\arcmin^{+0.4}_{-1.0})$. The kinematically
cold object has been found before using a smaller data set but the prediction
that this cold object has a velocity dispersion larger than $2.0\ \kms$ at 95%

with the information criteria and Bayesian evidence model selection methods to
argue that Ursa Minor has one or two localized secondary populations. The
significant probability for a large velocity dispersion in each secondary

halo, that is, it is a satellite of a satellite of the Milky Way.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements revealed that superconducting
phase forms a network in the samples quenched above iron vacancy order-disorder
transition temperature Ts. For the samples obtained by natural cooling down to
room temperature in the furnace, referred to as furnace cooling,
superconducting phase aggregates into micrometer-sized rectangular bars and
aligns as disconnected chains. Accompanying this change in morphology the
superconducting shielding fraction is strongly reduced in the furnace-cooling
samples. By post-annealing above Ts followed by quenching in room temperature
water, the network recovers with superconducting shielding fraction approaching
80%. A reversible change from network to bar chains was realized by a secondary
heat treatment in annealed samples showing large shielding fraction, i.e.,
heating above Ts followed by slow cooling across Ts. The large shielding
fraction observed in KxFe1.6+ySe2 single crystals actually results from a
uniform and contiguous distribution of superconducting phase. Through the
measurements of temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, it is found that the
reflection corresponding to superconducting phase merges into that from iron
vacancy ordered phase upon warming. It is a solid solution above Ts, where iron
atoms randomly occupy the both Fe1 and Fe2 sites in iron vacancy disordering
status. By cooling across Ts, superconducting phase precipitates while iron
vacancy ordered phase forms together, suggesting that phase separation in
KxFe1.6+ySe2 single crystals is driven by the iron vacancy order-disorder
transition.

with dependent quantized data under the assumption that the structure of the
joint probability density function (pdf) is known, but it contains unknown
deterministic parameters. The parameters may include different vector
parameters corresponding to marginal pdfs and parameters that describe
dependence of observations across sensors. Since MLE with a single quantizer is
sensitive to the choice of thresholds due to the uncertainty of pdf, we
concentrate on MLE with multiple groups of quantizers (which can be determined
by the use of prior information or some heuristic approaches) to fend off
against the risk of a poor/outlier quantizer. The asymptotic efficiency of the
MLE scheme with multiple quantizers is proved under some regularity conditions
and the asymptotic variance is derived to be the inverse of a weighted linear
combination of Fisher information matrices based on multiple different
quantizers which can be used to show the robustness of our approach. As an
illustrative example, we consider an estimation problem with a bivariate
non-Gaussian pdf that has applications in distributed constant false alarm rate

planes isolate zones (sometimes overlapping) that are predominately occupied by
different astrophysical object types. These techniques depend on the
reliability of the available MIR source photometry. In this pilot study we
concentrate on MIR point source detections and show that it is dangerous to
take the MIR GLIMPSE (Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire)
photometry from Spitzer for each candidate at face value without examining the
actual MIR image data. About half of our selected sources are spurious
detections due to the applied source detection algorithms being affected by
complex MIR backgrounds and the de-blending of diffraction spikes around bright
MIR point sources into point sources themselves. Nevertheless, once this
additional visual diagnostic checking is performed, valuable MIR selected PN
candidates are uncovered. Four turned out to have faint, compact, optical
counterparts in our H-alpha survey data missed in previous optical searches. We
confirm all of these as true PNe via our follow-up optical spectroscopy. This
lends weight to the veracity of our MIR technique. It demonstrates sufficient
robustness that high-confidence samples of new Galactic PN candidates can be
extracted from these MIR surveys without confirmatory optical spectroscopy and

more precise forms of analysis and prediction but comes at the price of high

hybrid-store database. Hybrid-store databases---that is, databases supporting
row- and column-oriented data management---are getting more and more prominent.
While the columnar management offers high-performance capabilities for
analyzing large quantities of data, the row-oriented store can handle
transactional point queries as well as inserts and updates more efficiently. To
effectively take advantage of both stores at the same time the novel question
whether to store the given data row- or column-oriented arises. We tackle this
problem with a storage advisor tool that supports database administrators at
this decision. Our proposed storage advisor recommends the optimal store based
on data and query characteristics; its core is a cost model to estimate and
compare query execution times for the different stores. Besides a per-table
decision, our tool also considers to horizontally and vertically partition the
data and manage the partitions on different stores. We evaluated the storage
advisor for the use in the SAP HANA database; we show the recommendation
quality as well as the benefit of having the data in the optimal store with
respect to increased query performance.

with multiple concurrent scans hitting the same table. The Cooperative Scans
(CScans) framework, which introduces an Active Buffer Manager (ABM) component
into the database architecture, has been the most effective and elaborate
response to this problem, and was initially developed in the X100 research
prototype. We now report on the the experiences of integrating Cooperative
Scans into its industrial-strength successor, the Vectorwise database product.
During this implementation we invented a simpler optimization of concurrent
scan buffer management, called Predictive Buffer Management (PBM). PBM is based
on the observation that in a workload with long-running scans, the buffer
manager has quite a bit of information on the workload in the immediate future,
such that an approximation of the ideal OPT algorithm becomes feasible. In the
evaluation on both synthetic benchmarks as well as a TPC-H throughput run we
compare the benefits of naive buffer management (LRU) versus CScans, PBM and
OPT; showing that PBM achieves benefits close to Cooperative Scans, while
incurring much lower architectural impact.

adaptation by using external scripts and/or by inserting operators into the
stream processing graph that are unrelated to the data processing logic. In
this paper, we describe a component called orchestrator that allows users to
write routines for automatically adapting the application to runtime
conditions. Developers build an orchestrator by registering and handling events
as well as specifying actuations. Events can be generated due to changes in the
system state (e.g., application component failures), built-in system metrics
(e.g., throughput of a connection), or custom application metrics (e.g.,
quality score). Once the orchestrator receives an event, users can take
adaptation actions by using the orchestrator actuation APIs. We demonstrate the
use of the orchestrator in IBM's System S in the context of three different
applications, illustrating application adaptation to changes on the incoming
data distribution, to application failures, and on-demand dynamic composition.

purpose of this thesis is to extend the main ideas of classical network
information theory to the study of classical-quantum channels. We prove coding
theorems for quantum multiple access channels, quantum interference channels,
quantum broadcast channels and quantum relay channels.
  A quantum model for a communication channel describes more accurately the
channel's ability to transmit information. By using physically faithful models
for the channel outputs and the detection procedure, we obtain better
communication rates than would be possible using a classical strategy. In this
thesis, we are interested in the transmission of classical information, so we
restrict our attention to the study of classical-quantum channels. These are
channels with classical inputs and quantum outputs, and so the coding theorems
we present will use classical encoding and quantum decoding. We study the
asymptotic regime where many copies of the channel are used in parallel, and
the uses are assumed to be independent. In this context, we can exploit
information-theoretic techniques to calculate the maximum rates for error-free
communication for any channel, given the statistics of the noise on that
channel. These theoretical bounds can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the
rates achieved by practical communication protocols.
  Most of the results in this thesis consider classical-quantum channels with
finite dimensional output systems, which are analogous to classical discrete
memoryless channels. In the last chapter, we will show some applications of our
results to a practical optical communication scenario, in which the information
is encoded in continuous quantum degrees of freedom, which are analogous to
classical channels with Gaussian noise.

describes the mean-field dynamics of mixed atomic-molecular Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs). The existence and stability of various modes is determined
by their total power, N, topological charge, m/2 [m is the intrinsic vorticity
of the second-harmonic (SH) field], and \chi ^{(2)} mismatch, q. The analysis
is carried out in a numerical form and, in parallel, by means of the
variational approximation (VA), which produces results that agree well with
numerical findings. Below a certain power threshold, N\leq N_{c}^{(m)}(q), all
trapped modes are of the single-color type, represented by the SH component
only, while the fundamental-frequency (FF) one is absent. In contrast with the
usual situation, where such modes are always unstable, we demonstrate\ that
they are stable, for m=0,1,2 (the mode with m=1 may be formally considered as a
semi-vortex with topological charge m/2=1/2), at N\leq N_{c}^{(m)}(q), and
unstable above this threshold. On the other hand, N_{c}^{(m)}(q)\equiv 0 at
q\geq q_{\max} (in our notation, q_{\max}=1$), hence the single-color modes are
unstable in the latter case. At N=N_{c}^{(m)}, the modes with m=0 and m=2
undergo a pitchfork bifurcation, which gives rise to two-color states, which
remain completely stable for m=0. The two-color vortices with m=2 (topological
charge 1) have an upper stability border, N=N_{c2}(q). Above the border, they
exhibit periodic splittings and recombinations, while keeping their vorticity.
The semi-vortex does not bifurcate; at N=N_{c}^{(m=1)}, it exhibits
quasi-chaotic oscillations and a rotating ""groove"" resembling a screw-edge
dislocation induced by the semi-integer vorticity.

neglecting turbulence. Analysing the condensations in which the discs form, we
show that the magnetic flux loss is not sufficient to explain the build-up of
Keplerian discs. The average magnetic field is strongly inclined to the disc
which might reduce the magnetic braking efficiency. However, the main reason
for the reduced magnetic braking efficiency is the highly disordered magnetic
field in the surroundings of the discs. Furthermore, due to the lack of a
coherently rotating structure in the turbulent environment of the disc no
toroidal magnetic field necessary for angular momentum extraction can build up.
Simultaneously the angular momentum inflow remains high due to local shear
flows created by the turbulent motions. We suggest that the ""magnetic braking

obtained for negativity in terms of teleportation fidelity using convex-roof
extension negativity (CREN). However, with this it is not clear how to
distinguish betweeen states useful for teleportation and positive partial
transpose (PPT) entangled states. Further, there exists a strong conjecture in
the literature that all PPT entangled states, in 3 \times 3 systems, have
Schmidt rank two. This motivates us to develop measures capable of identifying
states useful for teleportation and dependent on the Schmidt number. We thus
establish various relations between teleportation fidelity and entanglement
measures depending upon Schmidt rank of the states. These relations and bounds
help us to determine the amount of entanglement required for teleportation,
which we call the ``Entanglement of Teleportation''. These bounds are used to
determine the teleportation fidelity as well as the entanglement required for
teleportation of states modeled by a two qutrit mixed system, as well as two

is shown that this is in fact the case for certain congruences of timelike

feasible in an accelerated expanding Universe. Furthermore, a negative

hydrostatic atmospheres in a strong radial magnetic field, determining both
their maximum extent and photospheric temperatures. We find that
spatially-extended atmospheres cannot exist in such a field configuration:
typical maximum extent for magnetar-strength fields is ~10 m (as compared to
200 km in the non-magnetic case). Achieving balance of gravitational and
radiative forces over a large range of radii, which is critical to the
existence of extended atmospheres, is rendered impossible in strong fields due
to the dependence of opacities on temperature and field strength. We conclude
that high luminosity bursts in magnetars do not lead to expansion and cooling
of the photosphere, as in the non-magnetic case. We also find the maximum
luminosity that can propagate through a hydrostatic magnetar atmosphere to be
lower than previous estimates. The proximity and small extent of the
photospheres associated with the two different polarization modes also calls
into question the interpretation of two blackbody fits to magnetar burst

ratios between 0.25 and 1.5. Subtracting off the mean azimuthal flow velocity,
we compute the distribution of the in-plane and perpendicular peculiar velocity
due to large scale structure and turbulence induced by self-gravity. For the
lower mass discs, we show that the characteristic peculiar velocities scale
with the square root of the effective turbulent viscosity parameter, as
expected from local turbulent-disc theory. The derived velocities are
anisotropic, with substantially larger in-plane than perpendicular values. As
the disc mass is increased, the validity of the locally determined turbulence
approximation breaks down, and this is accompanied by anomalously large
in-plane broadening. There is also a high variance due to the importance of
low-m spiral modes. For low-mass discs, the magnitude of in-plane broadening
is, to leading order, equal to the predictions from local disc theory and
cannot constrain the source of turbulence. However, combining our results with
prior evaluations of turbulent broadening expected in discs where the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) is active, we argue that self-gravity may
be distinguishable from the MRI in these systems if it is possible to measure
the anisotropy of the peculiar velocity field with disc inclination.
Furthermore, for large mass discs, the dominant contribution of large-scale
modes is a distinguishing characteristic of self-gravitating turbulence versus
MRI driven turbulence.

partly dehydrochlorinated PVC on the border between them the barrier layer is
formed, which can be eliminated by doping with iodine giving significant
increase in electrical conductivity. This layer does not arise in the case of
type A modifier plasticized PVC. The presence of such layer can be interpreted
as a sign of the near-surface spatial heterogeneity associated with the
presence of conduction mechanism of double conjugated bonds.

phenomena in active non-equilibrium fluids proves even more difficult than for
conventional liquids or gases. It is not known which features of turbulent

theory to identify the statistical properties of self-sustained meso-scale

conditions affect collective bacterial dynamics, we measured energy spectra and
structure functions in dense Bacillus subtilis suspensions in quasi-2D and 3D

well with predictions from a minimal model for self-propelled rods, suggesting
that at high concentrations the collective motion of the bacteria is dominated
by short-range interactions. To provide a basis for future theoretical studies,
we propose a minimal continuum model for incompressible bacterial flow. A
detailed numerical analysis of the 2D case shows that this theory can reproduce
many of the experimentally observed features of self-sustained active

can account for the observed properties. Such a low overshooting is opposite to
our previous modelling results for the non-magnetic beta Cep star theta Oph
having very similar parameters, except for a slower surface rotation rate. We
discuss whether this result can be explained by the presence of a magnetic
field in V2052 Oph that inhibits mixing in its interior.

cosmology. Stars are known to form from the gravitational collapse of dense
clumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it has been proposed that the
resulting star formation rate is proportional to either the amount of mass
above a threshold gas surface density, or the gas volume density. These
star-formation prescriptions appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in our
Milky Way Galaxy's disk as well as in distant galaxies where the star formation
rates are often much larger. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, the Central
Molecular Zone (CMZ), contains the largest concentration of dense, high-surface
density molecular gas in the Milky Way, providing an environment where the
validity of star-formation prescriptions can be tested. Here we show that by
several measures, the current star formation rate in the CMZ is an
order-of-magnitude lower than the rates predicted by the currently accepted
prescriptions. In particular, the region 1 deg < l < 3.5 deg, |b| < 0.5 deg
contains ~10^7 Msun of dense molecular gas -- enough to form 1000 Orion-like
clusters -- but the present-day star formation rate within this gas is only
equivalent to that in Orion. In addition to density, another property of
molecular clouds, such as the amplitude of turbulent motions, must be included
in the star-formation prescription to predict the star formation rate in a
given mass of molecular gas.

sense that these correlations are related to global properties of the galaxies
and not with small patches of the interstellar medium. Although a possible weak
N/H gradient is observed in Tol 2146-391, the available data suggest that the
metals from previous star-formation events are well mixed and homogeneously
distributed through the optical extent of these galaxies. The spatial constancy
of the N/O ratio might be attributed to efficient transport and mixing of
metals by starburst-driven super-shells, powered by a plethora of unresolved
star cluster in the inner part of the galaxies. This scenario agrees with the
idea that most of the observed HeII4686 emission line, in our sample of

expectation of its $k$:th tensor power; thus the moment (if it exists) is an
element of a tensor power of the original Banach space.
  We study both the projective and injective tensor products, and their
relation. Moreover, in order to be general and flexible, we study three
different types of expectations: Bochner integrals, Pettis integrals and
Dunford integrals.
  One of the problems studied is whether two random variables with the same
injective moments (of a given order) necessarily have the same projective
moments; this is of interest in applications. We show that this holds if the
Banach space has the approximation property, but not in general.
  Several sections are devoted to results in special Banach spaces, including
Hilbert spaces, $C(K)$ and $D[0,1]$. The latter space is non-separable, which
complicates the arguments, and we prove various preliminary results on e.g.
measurability in $D[0,1]$ that we need.
  One of the main motivations of this paper is the application to Zolotarev
metrics and their use in the contraction method. This is sketched in an
appendix.

  in accreting neutron stars","Accepted for publication in MNRAS main journal",,"10.1093/mnras/stt599",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is assumed that accreting neutron stars (NSs) in LMXBs are heated due to
the compression of the existing crust by the accreted matter which gives rise
to nuclear reactions in the crust. It has been shown that most of the energy is
released deep in the crust by pycnonuclear reactions involving low-Z elements.
We discuss if NSs in very-faint X-ray transients (VFXTs; those which have peak
X-ray luminosities < 1E36 erg/s) can be used to test this model. Unfortunately
we cannot conclusively answer this because of the large uncertainties in our
estimates of the accretion rate history of those VFXTs, both the short-term
(less than a few tens of thousands of years) and the one throughout their
lifetime. The latter is important because it can be so low that the NSs might
not have accreted enough matter to become massive enough that enhanced cooling
processes become active. Therefore, they could be relatively warm compared to
other systems for which such enhanced cooling processed have been inferred.
However, the amount of matter can also not be too low because then the crust
might not have been replaced significantly by accreted matter and thus a hybrid
crust of partly accreted and partly original, albeit further compressed matter,
might be present. This would inhibit the full range of pycnonuclear reactions
to occur and thus very likely decreasing the amount of heat deposited in the
crust. Furthermore, better understanding is needed how a hybrid crust affects
other properties such as the thermal conductivity. We also show that some
individual NS LMXBs might have hybrid crusts as well as the NSs in HMXBs. This
has to be taken into account when studying the cooling properties of those
systems when they are in quiescence. We show that the VFXTs are likely not the
dominate transients that are associated with the brightest low-luminosity X-ray
sources in globular clusters as was hypothesized.

radiation bath produced by the dissipative motion of the inflaton field may
induce a significant thermal abundance of potentially dangerous gravitinos.
While previous discussions of this problem focused on gravitino production only
at the end of warm inflation, similarly to conventional reheating scenarios, we
study the full evolution of the gravitino abundance during and after inflation
for simple monomial potentials, taking into account the enhanced gravitino and
possibly gaugino masses due to supersymmetry breaking during inflation and the
smooth transition into a radiation-dominated era. We find, on one hand, that
the continuous thermal production increases the gravitino yield, although, on
the other hand, `freeze-out' occurs at temperatures much lower than previously
estimated. Moreover, for sufficiently strong dissipation, which allows for
sub-planckian inflaton values, the lower radiation temperature significantly
alleviates and possibly solves the gravitino problem, with a baryon asymmetry
being nevertheless produced through dissipative effects. Our analysis may also
be relevant to standard reheating as an oscillating inflaton will also change
the gravitino mass, potentially modifying the produced gravitino yield.

neutral hydrogen at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) should inaugurate the next
generation of cosmological observables. In this respect, many works have
concentrated on the disambiguation of the cosmological signals from the
dominant reionization foregrounds. However, even after perfect foregrounds
removal, our ignorance on the background reionization history can significantly
affect the cosmological parameter estimation. In particular, the
interdependence between the hydrogen ionized fraction, the baryon density and
the optical depth to the redshift of observation induce nontrivial degeneracies
between the cosmological parameters that have not been considered so far. Using
a simple, but consistent reionization model, we revisit their expected
constraints for a futuristic giant 21-cm omniscope by using for the first time
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on multiredshift full sky simulated
data. Our results agree well with the usual Fisher matrix analysis on the
three-dimensional flat sky power spectrum but only when the above-mentioned
degeneracies are kept under control. In the opposite situation, Fisher results
can be inaccurate. We show that these conditions can be fulfilled by combining
cosmic microwave background measurements with multiple observation redshifts
probing the beginning of EoR. This allows a precise reconstruction of the total
optical depth, reionization duration and maximal spin temperature. Finally, we
discuss the robustness of these results in presence of unresolved ionizing
sources. Although most of the standard cosmological parameters remain weakly
affected, we find a significant degradation of the background reionization
parameter estimation in presence of nuisance ionizing sources.

  Here we test the reliability of temperature diagnostics using 3D radiative

the Monte Carlo Markov chain EMD diagnostic. By comparing the derived EMDs with
the ""true"" distributions from the model we assess the limitations of the
diagnostics, as a function of the plasma parameters and of the signal-to-noise
of the data.
  We find that EMDs derived from EIS synthetic data reproduce some general
characteristics of the true distributions, but usually show differences from
the true EMDs that are much larger than the estimated uncertainties suggest,
especially when structures with significantly different density overlap along
the line-of-sight. When using AIA synthetic data the derived EMDs reproduce the
true EMDs much less accurately, especially for broad EMDs. The differences
between the two instruments are due to the: (1) smaller number of constraints
provided by AIA data, (2) broad temperature response function of the AIA
channels which provide looser constraints to the temperature distribution.
  Our results suggest that EMDs derived from current observatories may often
show significant discrepancies from the true EMDs, rendering their
interpretation fraught with uncertainty. These inherent limitations to the
method should be carefully considered when using these distributions to
constrain coronal heating.

elements at the 10^{-3} level. Measurements of the ac Stark (light) shift
around ""magic-zero"" wavelengths, where the light shift vanishes, provide
precise constraints on the matrix elements. We make the first measurement of
the 5s-6p matrix elements in rubidium by measuring the light shift around the
421 nm and 423 nm zeros with a sequence of standing wave pulses. In conjunction
with existing theoretical and experimental data, we find 0.3236(9) e a_0 and
0.5230(8) e a_0 for the 5s-6p_{1/2} and 5s-6p_{3/2} elements, respectively, an
order of magnitude more accurate than the best theoretical values. This
technique can provide needed, accurate matrix elements for many atoms,
including those used in atomic clocks, tests of fundamental symmetries, and
quantum information.

Russ (on behalf of the CDF Collaboration)","Polarization in Quarkonium Production","6 pages, 10 figures, submission to FPCP2012",,,,"hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Production mechanisms for quarkonium states in hadronic collisions remain
difficult to understand. The decay angular distributions of J/$\psi$ or
$\Upsilon(nS)$ states into $\mu^+ \mu^-$ final states are sensitive to the
matrix elements in the production process and provide a unique tool to evaluate
different models. This talk will focus on new results for the spin alignment of
$\Upsilon(nS)$ states produced in $p\bar{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 1.96
TeV using the CDF II detector at the Fermilab Tevatron. The data sample
corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 6.7 fb$^{-1}$. The angular
distributions are analyzed as functions of the transverse momentum of the
dimuon final state in both the Collins-Soper and the s-channel helicity frames
using a unique data-driven background determination method. Consistency of the
analysis is checked by comparing frame-invariant quantities derived from
parametrizations of the angular distributions measured in each choice of
reference frame. This analysis is the first to quantify the complete
three-dimensional angular distribution of $\Upsilon(1S), \Upsilon(2S)$ and
$\Upsilon(3S)$ decays. The decays are nearly isotropic in all frames, even when
produced with large transverse momentum.

(+/- 0.3 dex) of the stellar mass of the Milky Way (MW), there is a 11.9%
chance that one of these galaxies will have a close companion (within a
projected separation of 70 kpc and radial separation of 400 km/s) that is at
least as massive as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Two close companions at
least as massive as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) are rare at the 3.4%
level. Two full analogues to the MW- LMC-SMC system were found in GAMA (all
galaxies late-type and star forming), suggesting such a combination of close
together, late-type, star-forming galaxies is rare: only 0.4% of MW mass
galaxies (in the range where we could observe both the LMC and SMC) have such a
system. In summary, the MW-LMC-SMC system is a 2.7? event (when recast into
Gaussian statistics).
  Using cross-correlation comparisons we find that there is a preference for
SMC- LMC binary pair analogues to be located within 2 Mpc of a range of
different lumi- nosity groups. There is a particular preference is for such
binaries to be located near LG luminosity systems. When these groups are
subdivided into small magnitude gap and large magnitude gap subsets, the
binaries prefer to be spatially associated with the small magnitude gap
systems. These systems will be dynamically less evolved, but still offer the
same amount of gravitational dark matter. This suggests that binaries such as
the SMC-LMC might be transient systems, usually destroyed during vigorous
merger events. Details of a particularly striking analogue to the MW-SMC-LMC
and M31 complex are included.

trajectories of a diffusively-coupled compartmental ODE model, where each
compartment represents a spatial domain of components interconnected through
diffusion terms with like components in different compartments. Each set of
like components has its own weighted undirected graph describing the topology
of the interconnection between compartments. The condition makes use of the
Jacobian matrix to describe the dynamics of each compartment as well as the
Laplacian eigenvalues of each of the graphs. We discuss linear matrix
inequalities that can be used to verify the condition guaranteeing spatial
uniformity, and apply the result to a coupled oscillator network. Next we turn
to reaction-diffusion PDEs with Neumann boundary conditions, and derive an
analogous condition guaranteeing spatial uniformity of solutions. The paper
contributes a relaxed condition to check spatial uniformity that allows
individual components to have their own specific diffusion terms and
interconnection structures.

dissipative two-level system, i.e., the so-called spin-boson model. It is
interesting to find that the decoherence tends to be inhibited with the
increase of the coupling strength between the system and the reservoir, which
is contrary to the common recognition that a stronger coupling always induces a
severer decoherence. This is attributed to the occurrence of a quantum phase
transition (QPT). The relationship between this QPT and conventional
delocalized-localized QPT is also discussed. Our result suggests a useful
control method to overcome the detrimental effects of the reservoir to the
system.

down from a high platform, hanging from a rope, then swings at a great speed
like ""Tarzan"", and finally jumps ahead to land on the ground. The question now
arises: How far can Tarzan jump by the swing? In this article, I present an
introductory analysis of the Tarzan swing mechanics, a big pendulum-like swing
with Tarzan himself attached as weight. The analysis enables determination of
how farther forward Tarzan can jump using a given swing apparatus. The
discussion is based on elementary mechanics and, therefore, expected to provide
rich opportunities for investigations using analytic and numerical methods.

generates supersymmetric Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations in D=2+1, and
supersymmetric Korteweg-de Vries equations in D=1+1 after appropriate
dimensional reductions. We also show that a similar self-dual system in seven

we conjecture that lower-dimensional supersymmetric integral models can be
generated by non-supersymmetric self-dual systems in higher dimensions only
