the elements of the language if the data are drawn independent identically
distributed (i.i.d.), provided the probability mass function is computable and
has a finite expectation. We give an effective procedure to almost surely

the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. Assuming (ii) we obtain the weaker result

alpha effect responsible for the generation of astrophysical magnetic fields is
proportional to the logarithmic gradient of kinetic energy density rather than
that of momentum, as was previously thought. This result is in agreement with a
new analytic theory developed in this paper for large Reynolds numbers. Thus,
the contribution of density stratification is less important than that of
turbulent velocity. The alpha effect and other turbulent transport coefficients
are determined by means of the test-field method. In addition to forced
turbulence, we also investigate supernova-driven turbulence and stellar
convection. In some cases (intermediate rotation rate for forced turbulence,
convection with intermediate temperature stratification, and supernova-driven
turbulence) we find that the contribution of density stratification might be
even less important than suggested by the analytic theory.

Ecliptic PoleWide field (NEP-Wide) survey of AKARI, which is an infrared space
telescope launched by Japan. The NEP-Wide survey covered 5.4 deg2 area, a
nearly circular shape centered on the North Ecliptic Pole, using nine
photometric filter-bands from 2 - 25 {\mu}m of the Infrared Camera (IRC).
Extensive efforts were made to reduce possible false objects due to cosmic ray
hits, multiplexer bleeding phenomena around bright sources, and other
artifacts. The number of detected sources varied depending on the filter band:
with about 109,000 sources being cataloged in the near-IR bands at 2 - 5
{\mu}m, about 20,000 sources in the shorter parts of the mid-IR bands between 7
- 11 {\mu}m, and about 16,000 sources in the longer parts of the mid-IR bands,
with \sim 4,000 sources at 24 {\mu}m. The estimated 5? detection limits are
approximately 21 magnitude (mag) in the 2 - 5 {\mu}m bands, 19.5 - 19 mag in
the 7 - 11 {\mu}m, and 18.8 - 18.5 mag in the 15 - 24 {\mu}m bands in the AB
magnitude scale. The completenesses for those bands were evaluated as a
function of magnitude: the 50% completeness limits are about 19.8 mag at 3
{\mu}m, 18.6 mag at 9 {\mu}m, and 18 mag at 18 {\mu}m band, respectively. To
construct a reliable source catalog, all of the detected sources were examined
by matching them with those in other wavelength data, including optical and
ground-based near-IR bands. The final band-merged catalog contains about
114,800 sources detected in the IRC filter bands. The properties of the sources
are presented in terms of the distributions in various color-color diagrams.

have reached important milestones with the precise measurements of the
anti-proton and gamma-ray spectra, notably by the PAMELA and FERMI-LAT
experiments. While the gamma-ray results have been used to test the thermal
Dark Matter hypothesis and constrain the Dark Matter annihilation cross section
into Standard Model (SM) particles, the anti-proton flux measured by the PAMELA
experiment remains relatively unexploited. Here we show that the latter can be
used to set a constraint on the neutralino-chargino mass difference. To
illustrate our point we use a Supersymmetric model in which the gauginos are
light, the sfermions are heavy and the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP)
is the neutralino. In this framework the W^+ W^- production is expected to be
significant, thus leading to large anti-proton and gamma-ray fluxes. After
determining a generic limit on the Dark Matter pair annihilation cross section
into W^+ W^- from the anti-proton data only, we show that one can constrain
scenarios in which the neutralino-chargino mass difference is as large as ~ 20
GeV for a mixed neutralino (and intermediate choices of the anti-proton
propagation scheme). This result is consistent with the limit obtained by using
the FERMI-LAT data. As a result, we can safely rule out the pure wino
neutralino hypothesis if it is lighter than 450 GeV and constitutes all the
Dark Matter.

well-studied for persistence modules where homomorphisms are induced by
inclusion maps. In this paper, we propose a practical algorithm for computing
persistence under $\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients for a sequence of general
simplicial maps and show how these maps arise naturally in some applications of
topological data analysis.
  First, we observe that it is not hard to simulate simplicial maps by
inclusion maps but not necessarily in a monotone direction. This, combined with
the known algorithms for zigzag persistence, provides an algorithm for
computing the persistence induced by simplicial maps.
  Our main result is that the above simple minded approach can be improved for
a sequence of simplicial maps given in a monotone direction. A simplicial map
can be decomposed into a set of elementary inclusions and vertex collapses--two
atomic operations that can be supported efficiently with the notion of simplex
annotations for computing persistent homology. A consistent annotation through
these atomic operations implies the maintenance of a consistent cohomology
basis, hence a homology basis by duality. While the idea of maintaining a
cohomology basis through an inclusion is not new, maintaining them through a
vertex collapse is new, which constitutes an important atomic operation for
simulating simplicial maps. Annotations support the vertex collapse in addition
to the usual inclusion quite naturally.
  Finally, we exhibit an application of this new tool in which we approximate
the persistence diagram of a filtration of Rips complexes where vertex
collapses are used to tame the blow-up in size.

pairs of galaxies from the measurement of the relative velocity and the
projected separation (r_p) of the galaxies in the pair. Using the well
constrained selection function of the MASSIV sample we derive the gas-rich
major merger fraction (luminosity ratio mu = L_2/L_1 >= 1/4), and, using merger
time scales from cosmological simulations, the gas-rich major merger rate at a
mean redshift up to z = 1.54. We find a high gas-rich major merger fraction of
20.8+15.2-6.8 %, 20.1+8.0-5.1 % and 22.0+13.7-7.3 % for close pairs with r_p <=

studies at z < 1, the gas-rich major merger rate evolves as (1+z)^n, with n =

star-forming galaxies with stellar masses M = 10^10 - 10^10.5 M_Sun have
undergone a major merger since z ~ 1.5. We develop a simple model which shows
that, assuming that all gas-rich major mergers lead to early-type galaxies, the
combined effect of gas-rich and dry mergers is able to explain most of the
evolution in the number density of massive early-type galaxies since z ~ 1.5,
with our measured gas-rich merger rate accounting for about two-thirds of this

smooth (CSS) regulator function is considered. It is demonstrated that in an
appropriate limit the CSS regulator recovers the optimized one and it has
derivatives of all orders. The more generalized form of the CSS regulator is
shown to reduce to all major type of regulator functions (exponential,
power-law) in appropriate limits. The CSS regulator function is tested by
studying the critical behavior of the bosonized two-dimensional quantum
electrodynamics in the local potential approximation and the sine-Gordon scalar
theory for d<2 dimensions beyond the local potential approximation. It is shown
that a similar smoothing problem in nuclear physics has already been solved by
introducing the so called Salamon-Vertse potential which can be related to the
CSS regulator.

enormous mass densities in the cores of neutron stars, the hadrons in the
centers of neutron stars may undergo a phase transition to deconfined quark
matter. In this picture, neutron stars could contain cores made of pure (up,
down, strange) quark matter which are surrounded by a mixed phase of quarks and
hadrons. More than that, because of the competition between the Coulomb and the
surface energies associated with the positively charged regions of nuclear
matter and negatively charged regions of quark matter, the mixed phase may
develop geometrical structures, similarly to what is expected of the
sub-nuclear liquid-gas phase transition. In this paper we restrict ourselves to
considering the formation of rare phase blobs in the mixed quark-hadron phase.
The influence of rare phase blobs on the thermal and transport properties of
neutron star matter is investigated. The total specific heat, $c_V$, thermal
conductivity, $\kappa$, and electron-blob Bremsstrahlung neutrino emissivities,
$\epsilon_{\nu,\text{BR}}$, of quark-hybrid matter are computed and the results
are compared with the associated thermal and transport properties of standard
neutron star matter. Our results show that the contribution of rare phase blobs
to the specific heat is negligibly small. This is different for the neutrino
emissivity from electron-blob Bremsstrahlung scattering, which turns out to be
of the same order of magnitude as the total contributions from other
Bremsstrahlung processes for temperatures below about $10^8$ K.

novel approach.
  One subject with able-body and one with paraplegia due to SCI underwent
electroencephalogram (EEG) recording while engaged in alternating epochs of
idling and walking kinesthetic motor imagery (KMI). These data were analyzed to
generate an EEG prediction model for online BCI operation. A commercial robotic
gait orthosis (RoGO) system (treadmill suspended), was interfaced with the BCI
computer. In an online test, the subjects were tasked to ambulate using the
BCI-RoGO system when prompted by computerized cues. The performance of this
system was assessed with cross-correlation analysis, and omission and false
alarm rates.
  The offline accuracy of the EEG prediction model averaged 86.3%. The
cross-correlation between instructional cues and BCI-RoGO walking epochs
averaged 0.812 +/- 0.048 (p-value<10^-4). There were on average 0.8 false
alarms per session and no omissions.
  This is the first time a person with parapegia due to SCI regained basic
brain-controlled ambulation, thereby indicating that restoring brain-controlled
ambulation is feasible. Future work will test this system in a population of
individuals with SCI. If successful, this may justify future development of

the presence of condensed particles (clouds or hazes) in the atmosphere of the
latter.
  The main goal of this paper is to develop a self-consistent microphysical
cloud model for 1D atmospheric codes, which can reproduce some observed
properties of Earth, such as the average albedo, surface temperature, and
global energy budget. The cloud model is designed to be computationally
efficient, simple to implement, and applicable for a wide range of atmospheric
parameters for planets in the habitable zone.
  We use a 1D, cloud-free, radiative-convective, and photochemical equilibrium
code originally developed by Kasting, Pavlov, Segura, and collaborators as
basis for our cloudy atmosphere model. The cloud model is based on models used
by the meteorology community for Earth's clouds. The free parameters of the
model are the relative humidity and number density of condensation nuclei, and
the precipitation efficiency. In a 1D model, the cloud coverage cannot be
self-consistently determined, thus we treat it as a free parameter.
  We apply this model to Earth (aerosol number density 100 cm^-3, relative
humidity 77 %, liquid cloud fraction 40 %, and ice cloud fraction 25 %) and
find that a precipitation efficiency of 0.8 is needed to reproduce the albedo,
average surface temperature and global energy budget of Earth. We perform
simulations to determine how the albedo and the climate of a planet is
influenced by the free parameters of the cloud model. We find that the
planetary climate is most sensitive to changes in the liquid water cloud
fraction and precipitation efficiency.
  The advantage of our cloud model is that the cloud height and the droplet
sizes are self-consistently calculated, both of which influence the climate and
albedo of exoplanets.

radiatively active dust to predict the evolution of a local dust storm
monitored by OMEGA on board Mars Express. We show that the evolution of this
dust storm is governed by deep convective motions. The supply of convective
energy is provided by the absorption of incoming sunlight by dust particles,
rather than by latent heating as in moist convection on Earth. We propose to
use the terminology ""rocket dust storm"", or conio-cumulonimbus, to describe
those storms in which rapid and efficient vertical transport takes place,
injecting dust particles at high altitudes in the Martian troposphere (30 to 50
km). Combined to horizontal transport by large-scale winds, rocket dust storms
produce detached layers of dust reminiscent of those observed with Mars Global
Surveyor and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Since nighttime sedimentation is less
efficient than daytime convective transport, and the detached dust layers can
convect during the daytime, these layers can be stable for several days. The
peak activity of rocket dust storms is expected in low-latitude regions at
clear seasons (late northern winter to late northern summer), which accounts
for the high-altitude tropical dust maxima unveiled by Mars Climate Sounder.
Dust-driven deep convection have strong implications for the Martian dust
cycle, thermal structure, atmospheric dynamics, cloud microphysics, chemistry,
and robotic and human exploration.

the associated column densities are large, in the interval ~10^{22}-10^{24}

quantization, we generalize a previous axiomatic characterization of classical
linear bosonic field theory to include the fermionic case. We proceed to
describe the quantization scheme, combining a Fock space quantization for state
spaces with the Feynman path integral for amplitudes. We show rigorously that
the resulting quantum theory satisfies the axioms of the TQFT, in a version
generalized to include fermionic theories. In the bosonic case we show the
equivalence to a previously developed holomorphic quantization scheme.
Remarkably, it turns out that consistency in the fermionic case requires state
spaces to be Krein spaces rather than Hilbert spaces. This is also supported by
arguments from geometric quantization and by the explicit example of the Dirac
field theory. Contrary to intuition from the standard formulation of quantum
theory, we show that this is compatible with a consistent probability
interpretation in the GBF. Another surprise in the fermionic case is the
emergence of an algebraic notion of time, already in the classical theory, but
inherited by the quantum theory. As in earlier work we need to impose an
integrability condition in the bosonic case for all TQFT axioms to hold, due to
the gluing anomaly. In contrast, we are able to renormalize this gluing anomaly

galaxies (ETGs) are more compact than those with comparable mass at z\sim 0.
Such a size evolution is most likely explained by the `Dry Merger Sceanario'.
However, previous studies based on this scenario are not able to consistantly
explain both the properties of the high-z compact massive ETGs and the local
ETGs. We investigate the effect of multiple sequential dry minor mergers on the
size evolution of the compact massive ETGs. From an analysis of the Millennium
Simulation Database, we show that such minor (stellar mass ratio $M_{2}/M_{1} <
1/4$) mergers are extremely common during hierarchical structure formation. We
perform N-body simulations of sequential minor mergers with parabolic and
head-on orbits, including a dark matter component and a stellar component.
Typical mass ratios of the minor mergers are $1/20 < M_{2}/M_{1} < 1/10$. We
show that sequential minor mergers of compact satellite galaxies are the most
efficient at promoting size growth and decreasing the velocity dispersion of
the compact massive ETGs in our simulations. The change of stellar size and
density of the merger remnants is consistent with recent observations.
Furthermore, we construct the merger histories of candidates for the high-z
compact massive ETGs using the Millennium Simulation Database, and estimate the
size growth of the galaxies by the dry minor merger scenario. We can reproduce
the mean size growth factor between $z=2$ and $z=0$, assuming the most
efficient size growth obtained during sequential minor mergers in our
simulations. However, we note that our numerical result is only valid for
merger histories with typical mass ratios between 1/20 and 1/10 with parabolic
and head-on orbits, and that our most efficient size growth efficiency is
likely to an upper limit.

reported here utilize data collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC from
the 2010 Pb ion run corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 7 inverse
microbarns. The results are obtained using fully reconstructed jets using the
anti-kt algorithm with a per-event background subtraction procedure. A
centrality-dependent modification of the dijet asymmetry distribution is
observed, which indicates a higher rate of asymmetric dijet pairs in central
collisions relative to peripheral and pp collisions. Simultaneously the dijet
angular correlations show almost no centrality dependence. These results
provide the first direct observation of jet quenching. Measurements of the
single inclusive jet spectrum, measured with jet radius parameters R =
0.2,0.3,0.4 and 0.5, are also presented. The spectra are unfolded to correct
for the finite energy resolution introduced by both detector effects and
underlying event fluctuations. Single jet production, through the
central-to-peripheral ratio RCP, is found to be suppressed in central
collisions by approximately a factor of two, nearly independent of the jet pT.
The RCP is found to have a small but significant increase with increasing R,
which may relate directly to aspects of radiative energy loss.

GHz) from observations totaling ~ 70 deg^2 made with the SPIRE instrument
aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. We measure a fractional anisotropy dI /
I = 14 +- 4%, detecting signatures arising from the clustering of dusty
star-forming galaxies in both the linear (2-halo) and non-linear (1-halo)
regimes; and that the transition from the 2- to 1-halo terms, below which power
originates predominantly from multiple galaxies within dark matter halos,
occurs at k_theta ~ 0.1 - 0.12 arcmin^-1 (l ~ 2160 - 2380), from 250 to 500um.
New to this paper is clear evidence of a dependence of the Poisson and 1-halo
power on the flux-cut level of masked sources --- suggesting that some fraction
of the more luminous sources occupy more massive halos as satellites, or are
possibly close pairs. We measure the cross-correlation power spectra between
bands, finding that bands which are farthest apart are the least correlated, as
well as hints of a reduction in the correlation between bands when resolved
sources are more aggressively masked. In the second part of the paper we
attempt to interpret the measurements in the framework of the halo model. With
the aim of fitting simultaneously with one model the power spectra, number
counts, and absolute CIB level in all bands, we find that this is achievable by
invoking a luminosity-mass relationship, such that the luminosity-to-mass ratio
peaks at a particular halo mass scale and declines towards lower and higher
mass halos. Our best-fit model finds that the halo mass which is most efficient
at hosting star formation in the redshift range of peak star-forming activity,
z ~ 1-3, is log(M_peak/M_sun) ~ 12.1 +- 0.5, and that the minimum halo mass to
host infrared galaxies is log(M_min/M_sun) ~ 10.1 +- 0.6.

source catalog with high completeness of optical identification thanks to deep
optical images, we select a sample of 30 AGNs at $z > 3$ with intrinsic
(de-absorbed and rest-frame 2--10 keV) luminosities of $L_{\rm X} = 10^{44-45}$
erg s$^{-1}$ detected in the 0.5--2 keV band, consisting of 20 and 10 objects
with spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, respectively. Utilizing the
$1/V_{\rm max}$ method, we confirm that the comoving space density of luminous
AGNs decreases with redshift above $z > 3$. When combined with the {\it
Chandra}-COSMOS result of Civano et al.\ (2011), the density decline of AGNs
with $L_{\rm X} = 10^{44-45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ is well represented by a power law
of $(1 + z)^{-6.2 \pm 0.9}$. We also determine the fraction of X-ray obscured
AGNs with $N_{\rm H} > 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ in the Compton-thin population to be
0.54$^{+0.17}_{-0.19}$, by carefully taking into account observational biases
including the effects of photon statistics for each source. This result is
consistent with an independent determination of the type-2 AGN fraction based
on optical properties, for which the fraction is found to be 0.59$\pm$0.09.
Comparing our result with that obtained in the local Universe, we conclude that
the obscured fraction of luminous AGNs increases significantly from $z=0$ to
$z>3$ by a factor of 2.5$\pm$1.1.

observed high-dimensional data may have missing elements. The performance of
classical methods for change-point detection typically scales poorly with the
dimensionality of the data, so that a large number of observations are
collected after the true change-point before it can be reliably detected.
Furthermore, missing components in the observed data handicap conventional
approaches. The proposed method addresses these challenges by modeling the
dynamic distribution underlying the data as lying close to a time-varying
low-dimensional submanifold embedded within the ambient observation space.
Specifically, streaming data is used to track a submanifold approximation,
measure deviations from this approximation, and calculate a series of
statistics of the deviations for detecting when the underlying manifold has
changed in a sharp or unexpected manner. The approach described in this paper
leverages several recent results in the field of high-dimensional data
analysis, including subspace tracking with missing data, multiscale analysis
techniques for point clouds, online optimization, and change-point detection
performance analysis. Simulations and experiments highlight the robustness and
efficacy of the proposed approach in detecting an abrupt change in an otherwise
slowly varying low-dimensional manifold.

difference-frequency pressure generated in a nonlinear scattering of two
acoustic waves with an arbitrary wavefront by means of a rigid sphere.
Particularly, the difference-frequency generation is analyzed in the nonlinear
scattering with a spherical scatterer involving two intersecting plane waves in
the following configurations: collinear, crossing at right angles, and
counter-propagating. For the sake simplicity, the plane waves are assumed to be
spatially located in a spherical region which diameter is smaller than the
difference-frequency wavelength. Such arrangements can be experimentally
accomplished in vibro-acoustography and nonlinear acoustic tomography
techniques. It turns out to be that when the sphere radius is of the order of
the primary wavelengths, and the downshift ratio (i.e. the ratio between the
fundamental frequency and the difference-frequency) is larger than five,
difference-frequency generation is mostly due to a nonlinear interaction
between the primary scattered waves. The exception to this is the collinear
scattering for which the nonlinear interaction of the primary incident waves is
also relevant. In addition, the difference-frequency scattered pressure in all
scattering configurations decays as $r^{-1} \ln r$ and $1/r$, whereas $r$ is
the radial distance from the scatterer to the observation point.

carbon-oxygen (C-O) white dwarfs (WDs). The single-degenerate scenario is a
well-explored model of SNe Ia where unstable thermonuclear burning initiates in
an accreting, Chandrasekhar-mass WD and forms an advancing flame. By several
proposed physical processes the rising, burning material triggers a detonation,
which subsequently consumes and unbinds the WD. However, if a detonation is not
triggered and the deflagration is too weak to unbind the star, a completely
different scenario unfolds. We explore the failure of the
Gravitationally-Confined Detonation (GCD) mechanism of SNe Ia, and demonstrate
through 2D and 3D simulations the properties of failed-detonation SNe. We show
that failed-detonation SNe expel a few 0.1 solar masses of burned and
partially-burned material and that a fraction of the material falls back onto
the WD, polluting the remnant WD with intermediate-mass and iron-group
elements, that likely segregate to the core forming an WD whose core is iron
rich. The remaining material is asymmetrically ejected at velocities comparable
to the escape velocity from the WD, and in response, the WD is kicked to
velocities of a few hundred km/s. These kicks may unbind the binary and eject a
runaway/hyper-velocity WD. Although the energy and ejected mass of the
failed-detonation SN are a fraction of typical thermonuclear SNe, they are
likely to appear as sub-luminous low-velocity SNe Ia. Such failed detonations
might therefore explain or are related to the observed branch of peculiar SNe
Ia, such as the family of low-velocity sub-luminous SNe (SN 2002cx/SN
2008ha-like SNe).

I_i, i=1,2, of the channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) for each
user's channel can be either perfect (P), delayed (D) or not available (N),
i.e., I_1 and I_2 can take values of either P, D or N, and therefore the
overall CSIT can alternate between the 9 resulting states, each state denoted
as I_1I_2. The fraction of time associated with CSIT state I_1I_2 is denoted by
the parameter \lambda_{I_1I_2} and it is assumed throughout that
\lambda_{I_1I_2}=\lambda_{I_2I_1}, i.e., \lambda_{PN}=\lambda_{NP},
\lambda_{PD}=\lambda_{DP}, \lambda_{DN}=\lambda_{ND}. Under this assumption of
symmetry, the main contribution of this paper is a complete characterization of
the DoF region of the two user MISO BC with alternating CSIT. Surprisingly, the
DoF region is found to depend only on the marginal probabilities (\lambda_P,
\lambda_D,\lambda_N)=(\sum_{I_2}\lambda_{PI_2},\sum_{I_2}\lambda_{DI_2},
\sum_{I_2}\lambda_{NI_2}), I_2\in {P,D,N}, which represent the fraction of time
that any given user (e.g., user 1) is associated with perfect, delayed, or no
CSIT, respectively. As a consequence, the DoF region with all 9 CSIT states,
\mathcal{D}(\lambda_{I_1I_2}:I_1,I_2\in{P,D,N}), is the same as the DoF region
with only 3 CSIT states \mathcal{D}(\lambda_{PP}, \lambda_{DD}, \lambda_{NN}),
under the same marginal distribution of CSIT states, i.e., (\lambda_{PP},
\lambda_{DD},\lambda_{NN})=(\lambda_P,\lambda_D,\lambda_N). The results
highlight the synergistic benefits of alternating CSIT and the tradeoffs
between various forms of CSIT for any given DoF value.

opinion and incurs some cost depending on the opinions of his neighbors, his
initial opinion, and his stubbornness about his initial opinion. Agents
iteratively update their opinions based on their own initial opinions and
observing the opinions of their neighbors. The iterative update of an agent can

stubborn agents and the extent of their stubbornness. We also study the
convergence speed to such equilibrium and characterize the convergence time as

in an anticipated improvement in material property uniformity. Moreover, it is
recognized that in addition to Te particles, dislocation cells can also cause
electric field perturbation and the associated property non-uniformity. Further
improvement of the material, therefore, requires that dislocations in CZT
crystals be understood and controlled. Here we use a recently developed CZT
bond order potential to perform representative molecular dynamics simulations
to study configurations, energies, and mobilities of 29 different types of
possible dislocations in CdTe (i.e., x = 1) crystals. An efficient method to
derive activation free energies and activation volumes of thermally activated

important dislocations in the material, and gives guidance toward experimental

the fourth-order accurate WENO method developed by Liu et al. (1994) was
implemented on a non-uniform staggered mesh to discretize the scalar convection
while for the scalar diffusion a fourth-order accurate central discretization
was employed. The discretization of the scalar convection-diffusion equation
was combined with a fourth-order Navier-Stokes solver which solves the
incompressible flow. A dual meshing strategy was employed, in which the scalar
was solved on a finer mesh than the incompressible flow. The solver was tested
by performing a number of two-dimensional simulations of an unstably stratified
flow with low diffusivity scalar transport. The unstable stratification led to
buoyant convection which was modelled using a Boussinesq approximation with a
linear relationship between flow temperature and density. The order of accuracy
for one-dimensional scalar transport on a stretched and uniform grid was also
tested. The results show that for the method presented above a relatively
coarse mesh is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid flow, while the use
of a refined mesh for the low-diffusive scalars is found to be beneficial in

calculi) in the overdamped Langevin equation for the motion of a particle in an
inhomogeneous medium is often referred to as the ""Ito--Stratonovich dilemma,""
although there is, in fact, a continuum of choices. We introduce two Monte
Carlo (MC) simulation approaches for studying such systems, with both
approaches giving the choice between different calculi (in particular, Ito,
Stratonovich, and ""isothermal""). To demonstrate these approaches, we study the
diffusion on a 1D interval of a particle released at an interface (in the
middle of the system) between two media where this particle has different
diffusivities (e.g., two fluids with different viscosities). For reflecting
boundary conditions at the ends of the interval, a discontinuity at the
interface in the stationary-state particle distribution is found, except for
the isothermal case, as expected. We also study the first-passage problem using
absorbing boundary conditions. Good agreement is found when comparing the MC
approaches to theory as well as Brownian and Langevin dynamics simulations.
Also, the results themselves turn out to be interesting. For instance: 1) for
some calculi, there are more particles on the low-viscosity side (LVS) at
earlier times and then fewer particles at later times; 2) there is no
preference to end up on a particular wall for the Ito variant, but a bias
towards the wall on the LVS in all other cases; 3) the mean first-passage time
to the wall on the LVS grows as the viscosity on the other side is increased,
except for the isothermal case where it approaches a constant; 4) when the
viscosity ratio is high, the first-passage-time distribution for the wall on
the LVS is much broader than for the other wall, with a power-law dependence of
the former in a certain time interval whose exponent depends on the calculus.

framework is extended to incorporate subdivided population structure, thus
providing an efficiently computable CSD that admits a genealogical
interpretation related to the structured coalescent with migration and

the CSD developed here can be employed to yield accurate estimation of a wide

cosmological N-body code and describes many utilities and extensions that have
been added to the standard package. These include a memory-light runtime SO
halo finder, a non-Gaussian initial conditions generator, and a system of
unique particle identification. CUBEP3M is fast, its accuracy is tuneable to
optimize speed or memory, and has been run on more than 27,000 cores, achieving
within a factor of two of ideal weak scaling even at this problem size. The
code can be run in an extra-lean mode where the peak memory imprint for large
runs is as low as 37 bytes per particles, which is almost two times leaner than
other widely used N-body codes. However, load imbalances can increase this
requirement by a factor of two, such that fast configurations with all the
utilities enabled and load imbalances factored in require between 70 and 120
bytes per particles. CUBEP3M is well designed to study large scales
cosmological systems, where imbalances are not too large and adaptive
time-stepping not essential. It has already been used for a broad number of
science applications that require either large samples of non-linear
realizations or very large dark matter N-body simulations, including
cosmological reionization, halo formation, baryonic acoustic oscillations, weak
lensing or non-Gaussian statistics. We discuss the structure, the accuracy,
known systematic effects and the scaling performance of the code and its
utilities, when applicable.

the two-dimensional hyperbolic space, a constant-time surface in AdS3, the

coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) more clearly reveal their three-dimensional
structure than do observations made by a single spacecraft. The launch of the
STEREO twin observatories in October 2006 has greatly increased the number of
multipoint studies of ICMEs in the literature, but this field is still in its
infancy. To date, most studies continue to use on flux rope models that rely on
single track observations through a vast, multi-faceted structure, which
oversimplifies the problem and often hinders interpretation of the large-scale
geometry, especially for cases in which one spacecraft observes a flux rope,
while another does not. In order to tackle these complex problems, new modeling
techniques are required. We describe these new techniques and analyze two ICMEs
observed at the twin STEREO spacecraft on 22-23 May 2007, when the spacecraft
were separated by ~8 degrees. We find a combination of non-force-free flux rope
multi-spacecraft modeling, together with a new non-flux rope ICME plasma flow
deflection model, better constrains the large-scale structure of these ICMEs.
We also introduce a new spatial mapping technique that allows us to put
multispacecraft observations and the new ICME model results in context with the
convecting solar wind. What is distinctly different about this analysis is that
it reveals aspects of ICME geometry and dynamics in a far more visually
intuitive way than previously accomplished. In the case of the 22-23 May ICMEs,
the analysis facilitates a more physical understanding of ICME large-scale
structure, the location and geometry of flux rope sub-structures within these
ICMEs, and their dynamic interaction with the ambient solar wind.

vertical dispersion relations for spin excitations with anisotropic
incommensurability at low energy $\omega \le 90 meV$, which are reminiscent of
the experiments. At very high energy $\omega \ge 165 meV$, we also find
energy-dependent incommensurability. Although there are some important
difference between the three cases, unpolarized neutron measurements cannot
discriminate between these alternate possibilities; the vertical dispersion,
however, is a distinct feature of all three density wave states in contrast to

operators are not the same as in the random unitary case, highlighting a richer
separability structure of quantum channels with respect to quantum states.
Finally we consider the set of PPT maps, developing a technique to reveal NPT
maps.

diaelectric state will appear in ferroelectrics when the direction of SDIMF is
opposite to WMF and its strength is strong enough. In other words, we found a
way to design diaelectric materials (diaelectrics). Besides, the theory also

of mesons is expected from QCD, in which quarks interact which each other
through the exchange of colored self-interacting gluons. Owing to this
particular structure of QCD, configurations are allowed in which an excited
gluonic field contributes to the quantum numbers J^{PC} of the meson. States
with a valence color-octet qqbar' pair neutralized in color by an excited gluon
field are termed hybrids. The observation of such states, however, is difficult
because they will mix with ordinary qqbar' states with the same quantum

gluonic field may carry quantum numbers other than 0^{++}, however, this can
give rise to states with ""exotic"" quantum numbers J^{PC}=0^{--}, 0^{+-},
1^{-+}, 2^{+-},... The lowest-lying hybrid multiplet is expected to contain a
state with exotic quantum numbers J^{PC}=1^{-+}. The identification of such a

The search for hybrid states has been a central goal of hadron spectroscopy in
the last 20 years. Ongoing and upcoming high-statistics experiments are

harbor multiple populations with different chemical compositions and/or ages.
In the first case, the most common candidate is a spread in the initial helium
abundance, but this quantity is difficult to determine spectroscopically due to
the fact that helium absorption lines are not present in cooler stars, whereas
for hotter GC stars gravitational settling of helium becomes important. As a
consequence, indirect methods to determine the initial Y among populations are
necessary. For that reason, in this series of papers, we investigate the
effects of a Y enrichment in populations covering the range of GC
metallicities. In this first paper, we present the theoretical evolutionary
tracks, isochrones, and ZAHB loci calculated with the Princeton-Goddard-PUC
(PGPUC) stellar evolutionary code, which has been updated with the most recent
input physics and compared with other theoretical databases. The chemical
composition grid covers 9 Z ranging from Z=1.60x10^-4 to 1.57x10^-2, 7 Y from
Y=0.230 to 0.370, and an alpha-element enhancement of [alpha/Fe]=0.3. The
effects of different helium abundances that can be observed in isochrones are:
splits in the MS, differences in the L and Teff of the turn off point, splits
in the SGB being more prominent for lower ages or higher metallicities, splits
in the lower red giant branch being more prominent for higher ages or higher
metallicities, differences in L of the RGB bump (with small changes in Teff),
and differences in L at the RGB tip. At the ZAHB, when Y is increased there is
an increase of L for low Teff, which is affected in different degrees depending
on the age of the GC being studied. Finally, the ZAHB morphology distribution
depending on the age explains how for higher GC metallicities a population with
higher helium abundance could be hidden at the red ZAHB locus.

behavior of some strongly correlated systems. In this work we give a full
pedagogical treatment of a special simple case of these models, which we call
the 3D semion model: We calculate its ground state degeneracies for a variety
of boundary conditions, and classify its low-lying excitations. While point
defects in the bulk are confined in pairs connected by energetic strings, the
surface excitations are more interesting: the model has deconfined point
defects pinned to the boundary of the lattice, and these exhibit semionic
braiding statistics. The surface physics is reminiscent of a $\nu=1/2$ bosonic
fractional quantum Hall effect in its topological limit, and these
considerations help motivate an effective field theoretic description for the
lattice models as variants of $bF$ theories. Our special example of the 3D
semion model captures much of the behavior of more general `confined
Walker-Wang models'. We contrast the 3D semion model with the closely related
3D version of the toric code (a lattice gauge theory) which has deconfined
point excitations in the bulk and we discuss how more general models may have
some confined and some deconfined excitations. Having seen that there exist
lattice models whose surfaces have the same topological order as a bosonic
fractional quantum Hall effect on a confining bulk, we construct a lattice
model whose surface has similar topological order to a fermionic quantum hall
effect. We find that in these models a fermion is always deconfined in the
three dimensional bulk.

Einstein, and he suspected that in it must lie the key to a deeper

consider Galileo's law of free fall as a powerful argument in favor of
expanding the principle of relativity to systems moving non-uniformly relative
to each other. Einstein realized that he might be able to generalize the
principle of relativity when guided by Galileo's law of free fall; for if one
body fell differently from all others in the gravitational field, then with the
help of this body an observer in free fall (with all other bodies) could find
out that he was falling in a gravitational field.

continuous-time counterpart of the link transmission model. In addition, we
present a solution existence theory for the continuous-time network model and
investigate continuous dependence of the solution on the initial data, a
property known as well-posedness. We test the DAE system extensively on several
small and large networks and demonstrate its numerical efficiency.

correlation times for the vortex dynamics, in an iron-based superconductor,
have been derived. Upon cooling, the vortex dynamics displays a crossover
consistent with a vortex glass transition. The correlation times, in the fast
motions regime, merge onto a universal curve which is fit by the Vogel-Fulcher
law, rather than by an Arrhenius law. Moreover, the pinning barrier shows a
weak dependence on the magnetic field which can be heuristically justified
within a fragile glass scenario. In addition, the glass freezing temperatures
obtained by the two techniques merge onto the de Almeida-Thouless line. Finally
the phase diagram for the mixed phase has been derived.

galaxies (BCGs) spanning the redshift interval 0.03 < z < 1.63. We use this
sample, which covers 70% of the history of the universe, to measure the growth
in the stellar mass of BCGs after correcting for the correlation between the
stellar mass of the BCG and the mass of the cluster in which it lives. We find
that the stellar mass of BCGs increase by a factor of 1.8 between z=0.9 and
z=0.2. Compared to earlier works, our result is closer to the predictions of
semi-analytic models. However, BCGs at z=0.9, relative to BCGs at z=0.2, are
still a factor of 1.5 more massive than the predictions of these models. Star
formation rates in BCGs at z~1 are generally to low to result in significant
amounts of mass. Instead, it is likely that most of the mass build up occurs
through mainly dry mergers in which perhaps half of the mass is lost to the
intra-cluster medium of the cluster.

triplet character. This never happens in models where spins and charge carriers
share the same lattice, whether they are in the same band or in different
bands. This proves that effective one-lattice models do not describe correctly
the low-energy part of the two-carrier spectrum of a two-sublattice model, even
though they may describe the low-energy single-carrier spectrum appropriately.

ways of extracting the Wilson coefficients.

Hamiltonians, such as one-band models. We find that while this is possible in
the one-particle sector, the magnon-mediated interactions which are key to
properly describe the two-carrier states of the complex model are not
reproduced by the simpler models. We argue that this is true not just for
ferromagnetic, but also for antiferromagnetic backgrounds. Our results question
the ability of simple one-band models to accurately describe the low-energy

Einstein's field equations for flat FRW model in loop quantum cosmology have

field. We separately assumed the magnetic universe and electric universe. The
interaction between matter and magnetic field have been considered in one
section and for some particular form of interaction term, we have found the
solutions of magnetic field and the energy density of matter. We have also
considered the interaction between the matter and electric field and another
form of interaction term has been chosen to solve the field equations. The
validity of generalized second law of thermodynamics has been investigated on
apparent and event horizons using Gibb's law and the first law of
thermodynamics for magnetic and electric universe separately.
