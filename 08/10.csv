scales of 0.5-10 arcmin with very low systematics. The Small Array (AMI-SA; ten
3.7-m antennas) couples very well to Sunyaev-Zel'dovich features from galaxy

large numbers of objects. In this White Paper we review the new science - both

provide direct sensitivity to the physics of jet quenching. In a sample of
lead-lead collisions at sqrt(s) = 2.76 TeV corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of approximately 7 inverse microbarns, ATLAS has measured jets with
a calorimeter over the pseudorapidity interval |eta| < 2.1 and over the
transverse momentum range 38 < pT < 210 GeV. Jets were reconstructed using the
anti-kt algorithm with values for the distance parameter that determines the
nominal jet radius of R = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 and 0.5. The centrality dependence of
the jet yield is characterized by the jet ""central-to-peripheral ratio,"" Rcp.
Jet production is found to be suppressed by approximately a factor of two in
the 10% most central collisions relative to peripheral collisions. Rcp varies
smoothly with centrality as characterized by the number of participating
nucleons. The observed suppression is only weakly dependent on jet radius and
transverse momentum. These results provide the first direct measurement of
inclusive jet suppression in heavy ion collisions and complement previous
measurements of dijet transverse energy imbalance at the LHC.

essential for optimal performance of a wireless sensor network. Clustering
provides an effective way of extending the lifetime of a sensor network.
Clustering is the process that divides sensor networks into smaller localized
group (called clusters) of members with a cluster head. Clustering protocols
need to elect optimal number of clusters in hierarchically structured wireless
sensor networks. Any clustering scheme that elects clusters uniformly
(irrespective of the distance from Base Station) incurs excessive energy usage
on clusters proximal and distant to Base Station. In single hop networks a
gradual increment in the energy depletion rate is observed as the distance from
the cluster head increases. This work focuses on the analysis of wasteful
energy consumption within a uniform cluster head election model (EPEM) and
provides an analytic solution to reduce the overall consumption of energy usage
amongst the clusters elected in a wireless sensor network. A circular model of
sensor network is considered, where the sensor nodes are deployed around a
centrally located Base Station. The sensor network is divided into several
concentric rings centred at the Base Station. A model, Unequal Probability
Election Model (UEPEM), which elects cluster heads non-uniformly is proposed.
The probability of cluster head election depends on the distance from the Base
Station. UEPEM reduces the overall energy usage by about 21% over EPEM. The
performance of UEPEM improves as the number of rings is increased.

image, caused by the coarse quantization of DCT coefficients. A number of image
filtering approaches have been analyzed in literature incorporating
value-averaging filters in order to smooth out the discontinuities that appear

decrease the severity of these unwanted artifacts to some extent, other

employing smoothening, detection of blocked edges and then filtering the

Our investigation varied the central density of the progenitor white dwarf at
flame ignition, and considered its impact on the explosion yield, particularly
the production and distribution of radioactive Ni-56, which powers the light
curve. We performed a suite of two-dimensional simulations with randomized
initial conditions, allowing us to characterize the statistical trends that we
present. The simulations indicate that production of Fe-group material is
statistically independent of progenitor central density, but the mass of stable
Fe-group isotopes is tightly correlated with central density, with a decrease
in the production of Ni-56 at higher central densities. These results imply
progenitors with higher central densities produce dimmer events. We provide
details of the post-explosion distribution of Ni-56 in the models, including
the lack of a consistent centrally-located deficit of Ni-56, which may be
compared to observed remnants. By performing a self-consistent extrapolation of
our model yields and considering the main-sequence lifetime of the progenitor
star and the elapsed time between the formation of the white dwarf and the
onset of accretion, we develop a brightness-age relation that improves our
prediction of the expected trend for single degenerates and we compare this
relation with observations.

double-barrier resonant level structure and investigate resonant tunneling

of the resonance tends to zero. We argue that this unique behavior results from
many-body physics of interacting electrons and signals the presence of a
quantum phase transition (QPT). In our samples many parameters, including the
interaction strength, can be precisely controlled; thus, we have created an
attractive model system for studying quantum critical phenomena in general. Our
work therefore has broadly reaching implications for understanding QPTs in more

can observe the fine structure of the electron antineutrino survival

4pi/Delta M^2_31. The periodicity with respect to L/E is broken by 2-3
oscillations which, in the case of the normal (inverted) hierarchy, shift the
first 16 oscillations nearly 1% higher (lower) and move the next 16 lower
(higher). The energy of each peak determines a particular combination of the
mass differences, for example cos^2(theta12)Delta M^2_31 + sin^2(theta12)Delta
M^2_32 for nearly all peaks visible at baselines under 40 km. Comparing these

probability, near the maximum of the 1-2 oscillation the complex phase of the

between the reactors reduce the amplitudes of peaks below about 4 MeV. Second,
even reactors 100 or more kilometers away significantly obscure the 1-2

It is, therefore, very important to have the most reliable calibration of RXTE

on-board RXTE which provides data in 3-50 keV energy range with sub-millisecond

response residual minimization method used to derive the parameters of the PCA
physical model. The procedure is based on the residual minimization between the
model spectrum for Crab nebula emission and a calibration data set consisting
of a number of spectra from the Crab and the on-board Am241 calibration source,
uniformly covering the whole RXTE mission operation period. The new method led
to a much more effective model convergence and allowed for better understanding

troduces dependencies among flows that do not share a single link or node. As a
result, when designing a resource allocation scheme, be it a medium access
scheduler or a flow rate controller, one needs to consider the interdependence
among nodes within interference range of each other. Specifically, control
plane information needs to reach nearby nodes which often lie outside the
communi- cation range, but within the interference range of a node of interest.
But how can one communicate control plane information well beyond the existing
communication range? To address this fundamental need we introduce tag
spotting. Tag spotting refers to a communication system which allows re- liable
control data transmission at SNR values as low as 0 dB. It does this by
employing a number of signal encoding techniques including adding redundancy to
multitone modulation, shaping the spectrum to reduce inter-carrier interfer-
ence, and the use of algebraic coding. Making use of a detection theory-based
model we analyze the performance achievable by our modulation as well as the
trade-off between the rate of the information transmitted and the likelihood of
error. Using real-world experiments on an OFDM system built with software
radios, we show that we can transmit data at the target SNR value of 0 dB with
a 6% overhead; that is, 6% of our packet is used for our low-SNR decodable tags
(which carry up to a couple of bytes of data in our testbed), while the remain-
ing 94% is used for traditional header and payload data. We also demonstrate
via simulations how tag spotting can be used in implementing fair and efficient
rate control and scheduling schemes.

cluster candidates are now known by examining survey data. Here we report on
multiwavelength observations of six of these candidates in the Galaxy. We
carried out 4.9 and 8.5 GHz VLA observations of the radio emission associated
with these clusters to obtain the physical characteristics of the surrounding
gas, including the Lyman continuum photon flux and ionized gas mass. Spitzer
Infrared Array Camera observations were also made of these regions, and provide
details on the stellar population as well as the dust continuum and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon emission. When compared to the known young, massive
clusters in the Galaxy, the six cluster candidates have less powerful Lyman
ionizing fluxes and ionize less of the H II mass in the surrounding ISM.
Therefore, these cluster candidates appear to be more consistent with
intermediate-mass clusters (10^3-10^4 Msun).

that interactions near the horizon preclude traditional complementarity. But
the conjecture of 'fuzzball complementarity' works in the opposite way: the

this as a correction, we extend the gravitational redshift method employed by
Falcon et al. (2010) to use the apparent velocity of the HeI 5876AA line and
conduct the first gravitational redshift investigation of a group of WDs

apparent velocity, <v_app>_BI, (and hence average gravitational redshift,
<v_g>_BI) for our WDs; from that we derive an average mass, <M>_BI. For the
DBAs, we find <v_app>_BI = 40.8+/-4.7 km/s and derive <M>_BI = 0.71 +0.04 -0.05

using the same method (0.647 +0.013 -0.014 Msun; Falcon et al. 2010), we do not

between <v_app>_BI of the DBAs and <v_app> of normal DAs is no larger than 9.2
km/s, at the 95% confidence level; this corresponds to roughly 0.10 Msun. For
the DBs, we find <v_app>^He_BI = 42.9+/-8.49 km/s after applying the blueshift
correction and determine <M>_BI = 0.74 +0.08 -0.09 Msun. The difference between
<v_app>^He_BI of the DBs and <v_app> of DAs is less than or equal to 11.5 km/s
(~0.12 Msun), at the 95% confidence level. The gravitational redshift method
indicates much larger mean masses than the spectroscopic determinations of the

difficult task, as developers need to understand both the details of the
language in which their applications are written in, and also the intricacies
of the relational model. One popular solution to this problem is the use of
object-relational mapping (ORM) libraries that provide transparent access to
the database using the same language that the application is written in.
Unfortunately, using such frameworks can easily lead to applications with poor
performance because developers often end up implementing relational operations
in application code, and doing so usually does not take advantage of the
optimized implementations of relational operations, efficient query plans, or
push down of predicates that database systems provide. In this paper we present
QBS, an algorithm that automatically identifies fragments of application logic
that can be pushed into SQL queries. The QBS algorithm works by automatically
synthesizing invariants and postconditions for the original code fragment. The
postconditions and invariants are expressed using a theory of ordered relations
that allows us to reason precisely about the contents and order of the records
produced even by complex code fragments that compute joins and aggregates. The
theory is close in expressiveness to SQL, so the synthesized postconditions can
be readily translated to SQL queries. Using 40 code fragments extracted from
over 120k lines of open-source code written using the Java Hibernate ORM, we
demonstrate that our approach can convert a variety of imperative constructs
into relational specifications.

spaces, a common practical limiting difficulty is the necessity of computing
the kernel matrix, which most frequently leads to algorithms with running time
at least quadratic in the number of observations n, i.e., O(n^2). Low-rank
approximations of the kernel matrix are often considered as they allow the
reduction of running time complexities to O(p^2 n), where p is the rank of the
approximation. The practicality of such methods thus depends on the required
rank p. In this paper, we show that in the context of kernel ridge regression,
for approximations based on a random subset of columns of the original kernel
matrix, the rank p may be chosen to be linear in the degrees of freedom
associated with the problem, a quantity which is classically used in the
statistical analysis of such methods, and is often seen as the implicit number
of parameters of non-parametric estimators. This result enables simple
algorithms that have sub-quadratic running time complexity, but provably

the Euler-Poincare equation on the group of diffeomorphisms of the circle
$S^1$, and admits a class of soliton-like solutions named Teichons. Our method
relies on approximating the geodesic with these teichon solutions, which have
momenta given by a finite linear combination of delta functions. The geodesic
equation for this simpler set of solutions is more tractable from the numerical
point of view. With a robust numerical integration of this equation, we
formulate a shooting method utilizing a cross-ratio matching term. Several
examples of geodesics in the space of shapes are demonstrated.

in both metrology and as qubits for quantum information science (QIS). When
prepared in a superposition of two states and allowed to evolve freely, the
state of the system precesses with a frequency proportional to the splitting
between the states. In QIS,this precession forms the basis for universal
control of the qubit,and in metrology the frequency of the precession provides
a sensitive measurement of the splitting. However, on a timescale of the
coherence time, $T_2$, the qubit loses its quantum information due to
interactions with its noisy environment, causing qubit oscillations to decay
and setting a limit on the fidelity of quantum control and the precision of
qubit-based measurements. Understanding how the qubit couples to its
environment and the dynamics of the noise in the environment are therefore key
to effective QIS experiments and metrology. Here we show measurements of the
level splitting and dephasing due to voltage noise of a GaAs singlet-triplet
qubit during exchange oscillations. Using free evolution and Hahn echo
experiments we probe the low frequency and high frequency environmental
fluctuations, respectively. The measured fluctuations at high frequencies are
small, allowing the qubit to be used as a charge sensor with a sensitivity of
$2 \times 10^{-8} e/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, two orders of magnitude better than
the quantum limit for an RF single electron transistor (RF-SET). We find that
the dephasing is due to non-Markovian voltage fluctuations in both regimes and
exhibits an unexpected temperature dependence. Based on these measurements we
provide recommendations for improving $T_2$ in future experiments, allowing for
higher fidelity operations and improved charge sensitivity.

mass using the SDSS/DR7 spectroscopic catalogue. In contrast with previous
studies, which focussed mainly on bright primaries, our central galaxies span a
wide range of stellar mass, 10^7.5 < M_*^pri/M_sun < 10^11, from dwarfs to
central cluster galaxies. Our analysis confirms that the average number of
satellites around bright primaries, when expressed in terms of
satellite-to-primary stellar mass ratio (m_*^sat/M_*^pri), is a strong function
of M_*^pri. On the other hand, satellite abundance is largely independent of
primary mass for dwarf primaries (M_*^pri<10^10 M_sun). These results are
consistent with galaxy formation models in the LCDM scenario. We find excellent
agreement between SDSS data and semi-analytic mock galaxy catalogues
constructed from the Millennium-II Simulation. Satellite galaxies trace dark
matter substructure in LCDM, so satellite abundance reflects the dependence on
halo mass, M_200, of both substructure and galaxy stellar mass (M_*). Since
dark matter substructure is almost scale-free, the dependence of satellite
abundance on primary mass results solely from the well-defined characteristic
mass in the galaxy mass-halo mass relation. On dwarf galaxy scales, where
models predict a power-law scaling, M_* \propto M_200^2.5, similarity is
preserved and satellite abundance is independent of primary mass. For primaries
brighter than the characteristic mass of the M_*-M_200 relation, satellite
abundance increases strongly with primary mass. Our results provide strong
support for the steep, approximately power-law dependence of dwarf galaxy mass
on halo mass envisioned in LCDM galaxy formation models.

evidence of excessive power on scales of $50\hmpc$, which seems to be
inconsistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. We discuss
several assumptions and conventions used in studies of the large-scale bulk
flow to check whether this claim is robust under a variety of conditions.
Rather than using a composite catalogue we select samples from the SN, ENEAR,
SFI++ and A1SN catalogues, and correct for Malmquist bias in each according to
the IRAS PSCz density field. We also use slightly different assumptions about
the small-scale velocity dispersion and the parameterisation of the matter
power spectrum when calculating the variance of the bulk flow. By combining the
likelihood of individual catalogues using a Bayesian hyper-parameter method, we
find that the joint likelihood of the amplitude parameter gives
$\sigma_8=0.65^{+0.47}_{-0.35}(\pm 1 \sigma)$, which is entirely consistent
with the $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, the bulk flow magnitude ($v \sim 310
\kms$) and direction, $(l,b)\sim (280^{\circ} \pm 8^{\circ}, 5.1^{\circ} \pm
6^{\circ})$, found by each of the catalogues are all consistent with each
other, and with the bulk flow results from most previous studies. Furthermore,
the bulk flow velocities in different shells of the surveys constrain
$\sigma_{8}$--$\Omega_{\rm{m}}$ to be
($1.01^{+0.26}_{-0.20},0.31^{+0.28}_{-0.14}$, SFI++) and
($1.04^{+0.32}_{-0.24},0.28^{+0.30}_{-0.14}$, ENEAR), which is consistent with
{\it WMAP} 7-year best-fit values. We finally discuss the differences between
our conclusions and those of the studies claiming the largest bulk flows.

new fascinating avenue for exploring FFLO physics.

monopolar MMFs of both polarities streaming out from the leading negative
polarity pore of the observed active region. Combining different analyses of
the data, we investigated the temporal evolution of the relevant physical
quantities associated with the MMFs as well as the photospheric and
chromospheric signatures of these features.
  We show that the characteristics of the investigated MMFs agree with those
reported in the literature for MMFs that stream out from spots with penumbrae.
Moreover, observations of at least two of the observed features suggest them to
be manifestations of emerging magnetic arches.

Naturally, we want this superset to be as small as possible. We propose a novel
framework for screening, which we refer to as Multiple Grouping (MuG), that
groups variables, performs variable selection over the groups, and repeats this
process multiple number of times to estimate a sequence of sets that contains
the non-zero entries in \beta*. Screening is done by taking an intersection of
all these estimated sets. The MuG framework can be used in conjunction with any
group based variable selection algorithm. In the high-dimensional setting,
where p >> n, we show that when MuG is used with the group Lasso estimator,
screening can be consistently performed without using any tuning parameter. Our
numerical simulations clearly show the merits of using the MuG framework in
practice.

extraction of valuable data from measurements. The current availability of an
optimum data cube measured from a heterogeneous set of instruments and surveys
relies on a systematic and robust approach in the corresponding measurement
analysis. In that sense, the inference of configurable instrument parameters
can considerably increase the quality of the data obtained.
  This paper proposes a solution based on Bayesian inference for the estimation
of the configurable parameters relevant to the signal to noise ratio. The
information obtained by the resolution of this problem can be handled in a very
useful way if it is considered as part of an adaptive loop for the overall
measurement strategy, in such a way that the outcome of this parametric
inference leads to an increase in the knowledge of a model comparison problem
in the context of the measurement interpretation.
  The context of this problem is the multi-wavelength measurements coming from
diverse cosmological surveys and obtained with various telescope instruments.
As a first step,, a thorough analysis of the typical noise contributions will
be performed based on the current state-of-the-art of modern telescope
instruments, a second step will then consist of identifying configurable
parameters relevant to the noise model under consideration, for a generic
context of measurement chosen. Then as a third step a Bayesian inference for
these parameters estimation will be applied, taking into account a proper
identification of the nuisance parameters and the adequate selection of a prior
probability. Finally, a corresponding set of conclusions from the results of
the implementation of the method proposed here will be derived

transformations is constructed as a model system in which to study these types
of mixing processes. Illustrative examples of the mixing behaviors, including
pathological cases that violate the assumptions of the known governing theorems
and lead to poor mixing, are shown. Since the mathematical theory applies as
the number of iterations of the map goes to infinity, we introduce practical
measures of mixing (the percent unmixed and the number of intermaterial
interfaces) that can be computed over given (finite) numbers of iterations. We
find that good mixing can be achieved after a finite number of iterations of a
one-dimensional cutting and shuffling map, even though such a map cannot be
considered chaotic in the usual sense and/or it may not fulfill the conditions
of the ergodic theorems for interval exchange transformations. Specifically,
good shuffling can occur with only six or seven intervals of roughly the same
length, as long as the rearrangement order is an irreducible permutation. This
study has implications for a number of mixing processes in which
discontinuities arise either by construction or due to the underlying physics.

selected 27 for which we found low temperature experimental data in order to
pinpoint the relative situation of the newly proposed Wien2k(mBJLDA) method as
compared to other methods in the literature. We found that the GWA gives the
most accurate predictions. The Wien2k (mBJLDA) code is slightly less precise,
in general. The Hybrid functionals are less accurate, on the overall. The GWA
is definitely the most precise existing method nowadays. In 88% of the
semiconductors considered the error was less than 10%. Both, the GWA and the
mBJLDA potential, reproduce the band gap of 15 of the 27 semiconductors
considered with a 5% error or less. An extra factor to be taken into account is
the computational cost. If one would seek for precision without taking this
factor into account, the GWA is the method to use. If one would prefer to
sacrifice a little the precision obtained against the savings in computational
cost, the empirical mBJLDA potential seems to be the appropriate method. We
include a graph that compares directly the performance of the best three
methods, according to our analysis, for each of the 27 semiconductors studied.

astronomers of the 17th and18th centuries sought to measure the annual parallax

parallax of the star 61 Cygni. But the early failures to detect annual stellar
parallax led to the discovery of a new (and entirely unexpected) phenomenon:
the aberration of starlight. This paper recounts the story of the discovery of
stellar aberration. It is accompanied by a set of activities and computer
simulations that allow students to explore this fascinating historical episode

episodes of brightening and dimming events including prolonged faint states.
The observed high-amplitude variations are largely consistent with extinction
changes having a 220 day quasi-periodic signal. Spectral evolution includes not
only changes in the spectral slope but correlated variation in the prominence
of TiO/VO/CO bands and atomic line emission, as well as anticorrelated
variation in forbidden line emission which, along with H_2, dominates optical
and infrared spectra at faint epochs. Neutral and singly-ionized atomic species
are likely formed in an accretion flow and/or impact while the origin of
zero-velocity atomic LiI 6707 in emission is unknown. Forbidden lines,
including several rare species, exhibit blueshifted emission profiles and
likely arise from an outflow/jet. Several of these lines are also seen
spatially offset from the continuum source position, presumably in a shocked
region of an extended jet. CARMA maps resolve on larger scales a spatially
extended outflow in mm-wavelength CO. We attribute the observed photometric and
spectroscopic behavior in terms of occultation of the central star as well as
the bright inner disk and the accretion/outflow zones that renders shocked gas
in the inner part of the jet amenable to observation at the faint epochs. We
discuss PTF 10nvg as a source exhibiting both accretion-driven (perhaps
analogous to V1647 Ori) and extinction-driven (perhaps analogous to UX Ori or

contact, C, is proportional to the derivative of the energy with respect to the
interaction strength, and is thus an essential thermodynamic quantity for a gas
with short-range correlations. Theoretical predictions for the temperature
dependence of C differ substantially, especially near the superfluid
transition, Tc, where C is predicted to either sharply decrease, sharply
increase, or change very little. For T/T_F>0.4, our measurements of the
homogeneous gas contact show a gradual decrease of C with increasing
temperature, as predicted by theory. We observe a sharp decrease in C at
T/T_F=0.16, which may be due to the superfluid phase transition. While a sharp
decrease in C below Tc is predicted by some many-body theories, we find that
none of the predictions fully accounts for the data.

events under consideration, the CME initiation is marked by filament
(prominence) eruption or by a loop-like structure having another nature.
Subsequently, several loop-like structures having higher brightness and
following each other at different velocities appear in the region of the CME
initiation. The CME frontal structure is formed by these loop-like structures.
The time-dependent velocities and acceleration of the ejection front have been
obtained for all CMEs under consideration. We have drawn a conclusion about the
possible existence of two CME types dependent on the time profile of their
velocity. The first CME type comprises the ejections whose velocity decreases
abruptly by more than 100 km/s after having reached the maximum; it thereupon
passes to slow deceleration/variation. The second CME type is formed by the
ejections whose velocity varies insignificantly after reaching the maximum. The
CME angular size is shown to increase up to threefold at the initial stage of
propagation; it increases twofold 3.5-11 minutes after the first measurement of
this parameter. When considering 3 CMEs, we see that their broadening exceeds
their extension in the longitudinal direction during a certain period of time
at the initial propagation stage.

in recent years, enabling the application of this material to a wide range of
optical and electrical applications. In designing structures and optimizing
device performances, it is crucial that the Mg content of the alloy be
controllable and precisely determined. In this study, we have established
laboratory-based methods to determine the Mg content of MgxZn1-xO thin films
grown on ZnO substrates, ranging from the solubility limit of x ~ 0.4 to the
dilute limit of x < 0.01. For the absolute determination of Mg content,
Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy is used for the high Mg region above x =
0.14, while secondary ion mass spectroscopy is employed to quantify low Mg
content. As a lab-based method to determine the Mg content, c-axis length is
measured by X-ray diffraction and is well associated with Mg content. The
interpolation enables the determination of Mg content to x = 0.023, where the
peak from the ZnO substrate overlaps the MgxZn1-xO peak in standard laboratory
equipment, and thus quantitative determination. At dilute Mg contents below x =
0.023, the localized exciton peak energy of the MgxZn1-xO films as measured by
photoluminescence is found to show a linear Mg content dependence, which is
well resolved from the free exciton peak of ZnO substrate down to x = 0.0043.
Our results demonstrate that X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence in
combination are appropriate methods to determine Mg content in a wide Mg range

confirm that the brown dwarf companion candidate to the north of PDS 70 is a

Carlo radiative transfer modeling, we infer the existence of an optically thick

changes in its direction. It is suggested that a process of this type could
occur in the Sun's corona, significantly affecting the solar fluxes of one or

exact solutions for the unforced problem we study the behavior of solitary wave
solutions to the NLDE in the presence of a wide variety of fields in a
variational approximation depending on collective coordinates which allows the
position, width and phase of these waves to vary in time. We find that in this
approximation the position $q(t)$ of the center of the solitary wave obeys the
usual behavior of a relativistic point particle in an external field. For time
independent external fields we find that the energy of the solitary wave is
conserved but not the momentum which becomes a function of time. We postulate
that similar to the nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger equation (NLSE) that a sufficient
dynamical condition for instability to arise is that $ dP(t)/d \dq(t) < 0$.
Here $P(t)$ is the momentum of the solitary wave, and $\dq$ is the velocity of
the center of the wave in the collective coordinate approximation. We found for
our choices of external potentials we always have $ dP(t)/d \dq(t) > 0$ so when
instabilities do occur they are due to a different source. We investigate the
accuracy of our variational approximation using numerical simulations of the

predictions are shown to reproduce the observations remarkably well. We then
adopt these model parameters to calculate the halo occupation distribution

shown to provide a reasonably good fit to the observed clustering of LBGs at
both large (\theta>80"") and small (\theta < 10"") angular scales for z=3-5 and
several limiting magnitudes. However, our models underpredict the clustering
amplitude at intermediate angular scales, where quasi-linear effects are
important. The average mass of halos contributing to the observed clustering is
found to be 6.2 x 10^{11} M_\odot and the characteristic mass of a parent halo
hosting satellite galaxies is 1.2 \times 10^{12} M_\odot for a limiting
absolute magnitude of -20.5 at z=4. For a given threshold luminosity these
masses decrease with increasing z and at any given z these are found to
increase with increasing value of threshold luminosity. We find that
approximately 40 % of the halos above a minimum mass M_{min}, can host
detectable central galaxies and about 5-10 % of these halos are likely to also
host a detectable satellite. The satellites form typically a dynamical
timescale prior to the formation of the parent halo. The small angular scale
clustering is due to central-satellite pairs and is quite sensitive to changes
in the duration of star formation in a halo. The present data favor star
formation in a halo lasting typically for a few dynamical time-scales. Our
models also reproduce different known trends between parameters related to star
formation.

  Defense of Japan at Oct. 2011",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is claimed in the many papers that a trace distance ($d$) guarantees the
universal composition security in quantum key distribution (QKD). In this
introduction paper, at first, it is explicitly explained what is the main
misconception in the claim of the unconditional security for QKD theory. In
general terms, the cause of the misunderstanding on the security claim is the
Lemma in the paper of Renner. It suggests that the generation of the perfect
random key is assured by the probability $ (1-d)$, and its failure probability
is $d$. Thus, it concludes that the generated key provides the perfect random
key sequence when the protocol suceeds. So the QKD provides perfect secrecy to
the one time pad. This is the reason for the composition claim. However, the
quantity of the trace distance (or variational distance) is not the probability
for such an event. If $d $ is not small enough, always the generated key
sequence is not uniform. Now one needs the reconstruction of the evaluation of
the trace distance if one wants to use it. One should first go back to the
indistinguishability theory in the computational complexity based, and to
clarify the meaning of the value of the variational distance. In addition, the
same analysis for the information theoretic case is necessary. The recent
serial papers by H.P.Yuen have given the answer on such questions. In this
paper, we show more concise description of Yuen's theory, and clarify that the
recent upper bound theories for the trace distance by Tomamichel et al and
Hayashi et al are constructed based on the reasoning of Renner and it is
unsuitable as the analysis for information theoretic security. Finally, we
introduce a macroscopic quantum communication with different principle to
replace Q-bit QKD.

specify the state of the network. A relaying protocol uses a specific sequence
of states and a coding scheme for each state. In this paper, we first obtain an
outer bound for the rate region of all achievable $(R_a,R_b)$ based on the
half-duplex cut-set bound. This outer bound can be numerically computed by
solving a linear program. It is proved that at any point on the boundary of the
outer bound only four of the six states of the network are used. We then
compare it with achievable rate regions of various known protocols. We consider
two kinds of protocols: (1) protocols in which all messages transmitted in a
state are decoded with the received signal in the same state, and (2) protocols
where information received in one state can also be stored and used as side
information to decode messages in future states. Various conclusions are drawn
on the importance of using all states, use of side information, and the choice
of processing at the relay. Then, two analytical outer bounds (as opposed to an

and in the fifth cavity dipole band at approximately 9 GHz were found, that can
provide a local measurement of the beam position. In contrast, propagating

compared in extracting beam position information from the dipole HOMs: direct
linear regression and singular value decomposition. Current experiments suggest
a resolution of 50 {\mu}m accuracy in predicting local beam position using

nonlinear Gross-Pitaevskii equations. The importance of studying excited states
of Bose-Einstein condensates is also underlined by a recent experiment of
B\""ucker et al in which vibrational state inversion of a Bose-Einstein
condensate has been achieved by transferring the entire population of the
condensate to the first excited state. Here, we focus on demonstrating the
applicability of our algorithm for three different potentials by means of
numerical results for the energy eigenstates and eigenvalues of the 1D
Grosss-Pitaevskii-equation. We compare the numerically found solutions and find
out that they completely agree with the case of known analytical solutions.

  Logic, Language, Information and Computation. September 3rd to 6th, 2012
  University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina",,,,"cs.FL cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed systems are notoriously difficult to understand and analyze in
order to assert their correction w.r.t. given properties. They often exhibit a
huge number of different behaviors, as soon as the active entities (peers,
agents, processes, etc) behave in an asynchronous manner. Already the
modelization of such systems is a non-trivial task, let alone their formal
verification.
  The purpose of this paper is to discuss the problem of distributed monitoring
on a simple model of finite-state distributed automata based on shared actions,
called asynchronous automata. Monitoring is a question related to runtime
verification: assume that we have to check a property $L$ against an unknown or
very complex system $A$, so that classical static analysis is not possible.
Therefore instead of model-checking a monitor is used, that checks the property
on the underlying system at runtime.
  We are interested here in monitoring distributed systems modeled as
asynchronous automata. It is natural to require that monitors should be of the
same kind as the underlying system, so we consider here distributed monitoring.
A distributed monitor does not have a global view of the system, therefore we
propose the notion of locally monitorable trace language. Our main result shows
that if the distributed alphabet of actions is connected and if $L$ is a set of
infinite traces such that both $L$ and its complement $L^c$ are countable
unions of locally safety languages, then $L$ is locally monitorable. We also
show that over infinite traces, recognizable countable unions of locally safety
languages are precisely the complements of deterministic languages.

accompanying the cosmological expansion of nonrelativistic fermionic matter.
This occurs without the need for any fluid, like e.g. dynamical scalar field
(quintessence, cosmon, etc.), and with conventional form of the Einstein
equations in contrast to other known geometrical DE models. The phenomenon
results from first principles in the framework of the two measures field theory
where, in the Einstein frame, both fermion masses and the cosmological constant
(CC) turn into functions of the cold fermion density n. This n dependence
becomes negligible in regular (laboratory) conditions but it may have an
important role in cosmology. In the 4D gravity model where the original action
involves only CC and massive fermions without selfinteraction, for different
(but wide) regions in the parameter space we have found two possible classes of
scenarios for the late universe starting from the cold matter domination era.
We argue that the fermions which drive the variable CC should be associated
with cold neutrinos disposed in voids and supervoids. The cosmological dynamics
of the first class practically coincides with that of the LambdaCDM model,
while the dynamics of the second class is of the phantom-like regime with a
pseudo-rip scenario. Crossing the phantom divide happens due to a new type of
the neutrino DE effect where neutrinos pass through the state with zero mass
and with the vacuum-like EoS P_{\nu}=-\rho_{\nu}.

for examining the properties of nonlinear field theories embedded in expanding

cosmology, as well as different systems in the disciplines of statistical
mechanics and condensed matter physics. Field theories are characterized by the
speed at which they propagate correlations within themselves. We show that for
linear field theories correlations stop propagating if and only if the speed at
which the space dilates is higher than the speed at which correlations
propagate. The situation is in general different for nonlinear field theories.
In this case correlations might stop propagating even if the velocity at which
space dilates is lower than the velocity at which correlations propagate. In
particular, these results imply that it is not possible to characterize the
dynamics of a nonlinear field theory during homogeneous spatial dilation {\it a

marginal approaches the posterior distribution. Inspired by Simulated
Annealing, we present a new class of particle algorithms for ABC, based on a

present a scheme that adapts the tolerance and the jump distribution in

the statistical independence of the particles, in the limit of infinite sample
size. This adaptive scheme aims at converging as close as possible to the

entropy production in the system. The performance of this new class of
algorithms is compared against two other recent algorithms on two toy examples.

a first order nature of the magnetic phase transition in MnSi. Application of
high pressure shows fast degradation of the first order features of the phase

features of the phase transition that disappear on pressure increasing. They
are a sharp peak marking the first order phase transition and a shallow
maximum, situated slightly above the critical temperature and pointing to the
domain of prominent helical fluctuations. The current experimental data rule
out any strong first order phase transition in MnSi at high pressures and low
temperatures, which would prevent development of a quantum critical region. On
the contrary, there should exist true quantum critical phenomena in MnSi at
high pressures because a tiny first order transition, if it survives at high

to convey our knowledge of a sequence to the reader. Ideally, annotations are
curated manually, however manual curation is costly, time consuming and
requires expert knowledge and training. Given these issues and the exponential
increase of data, many databases implement automated annotation pipelines in an
attempt to avoid un-annotated entries. Both manual and automated annotations
vary in quality between databases and annotators, making assessment of
annotation reliability problematic for users. The community lacks a generic
measure for determining annotation quality and correctness, which we look at
addressing within this article. Specifically we investigate word reuse within
bulk textual annotations and relate this to Zipf's Principle of Least Effort.
We use UniProt Knowledge Base (UniProtKB) as a case study to demonstrate this
approach since it allows us to compare annotation change, both over time and
between automated and manually curated annotations.
  Results: By applying power-law distributions to word reuse in annotation, we
show clear trends in UniProtKB over time, which are consistent with existing
studies of quality on free text English. Further, we show a clear distinction
between manual and automated analysis and investigate cohorts of protein
records as they mature. These results suggest that this approach holds distinct
promise as a mechanism for judging annotation quality.

to their chemical peculiarities in terms of strength and directionality, a
particular attention must be paid to the definition of the hydrogen bond
potential itself. This global target has been tackled through a computational
approach based on a minimalist description of the protein and the proper design
of algorithms, mainly using Monte Carlo and Kinetic Monte Carlo methods. We
have designed a hydrogen bond potential, see J. Chem. Phys. 132, 235102 (2010).
We have been performed a complete study of sequenceless peptide systems under
different conditions, such as temperature and concentration. To carry out full
protein studies, we need additional potentials to describe tertiary
interactions. We have discussed two different points of view. The first one is
the combination of the hydrogen bond potential with a structure-based one. We
have evaluated the implications of a proper definition of hydrogen bonds in the
thermodynamic and dynamic aspects of protein folding. See Biophys. J. 101,
1474-1482 (2011). We have undertaken a second strategy, combining a generic
hydrophobic model with the hydrogen bond one. The two main factors of folding
and aggregation are merged, then, to create a simple but complete potential.
Thanks to it, we have re-studied peptide aggregation including sequence.
Besides, we have simulated complete proteins with different folded shapes. We
have analyzed the competition between folding and aggregation, and how sequence
and hydrogen bonds can influence the interplay between them. See J. Chem. Phys.

pseudo-Riemannian symmetric space be realized as a conformal holonomy group?
Using recent results of Cap, Gover and Hammerl, we study the representations of
SO(2,1), PSU(2,1) and PSp(2,1) as isotropy groups of irreducible symmetric
spaces of signature (3,2), (4,4) and (6,8), respectively, describing the
geometry induced by a conformal holonomy reduction to the corresponding
subgroups. In the case of SO(2,1) we show that conformal manifolds with such a
holonomy reduction are always locally conformally flat and hence this group
cannot be a conformal holonomy group. This result completes the classification
of irreducible conformal holonomy groups in Lorentzian signature. In the case
of PSU(2,1), we show that conformal manifolds of signature (3,3) with this
holonomy reduction carry, on an open dense subset, a canonical nearly
para-Kaehler metric with positive Einstein constant. For PSp(2,1) we also show
that there is an open dense subset endowed with a canonical Einstein metric in
the conformal class. As a result, after restricting to an open dense subset the
conformal holonomy must be a proper subgroup of PSU(2,1) or of PSp(2,1),
respectively. Finally, using a recent result of Graham and Willse we prove the
following general non-existence result: for a real-analytic, odd-dimensional
conformal manifold, the conformal holonomy group can never be given by the
isotropy representation of an irreducible pseudo-Riemannian symmetric space
unless the isotropy is SO(p+1,q+1).

giving rise to an irreducible square-integrable quasi-regular representation on

integrable as well, with respect to a wide variety of weights, thus allowing to
consistently quantify coefficient decay via coorbit space norms. We then show
that these spaces always admit an atomic decomposition in terms of bandlimited
Schwartz wavelets. We exhibit spaces of Schwartz functions densely contained in
(most of) the coorbit spaces. We also present an example showing that for a
consistent definition of coorbit spaces, the irreducibility requirement cannot
be easily dispensed with.
  We then address the question how to predict wavelet coefficient decay from
vanishing moment assumptions. To this end, we introduce a new condition on the
open dual orbit associated to a dilation group: If the orbit is temperately
embedded, it is possible to derive rather general weighted ${\rm
L}^{p,q}$-estimates for the wavelet coefficients from vanishing moment
conditions on the wavelet and the analyzed function. These estimates have
various applications: They provide very explicit admissibility conditions for
wavelets and integrable vectors, as well as sufficient criteria for membership
in coorbit spaces. As a further consequence, one obtains a transparent way of
identifying elements of coorbit spaces with certain (cosets of) tempered
distributions.
  We then show that, for every dilation group in dimension two, the associated
dual orbit is temperately embedded. In particular, the general results derived
in this paper apply to the shearlet group and its associated family of coorbit
spaces, where they complement and generalize the known results.

spin correlations in CeIr(In$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$)$_5$ by means of
In-Nuclear-Quadrupole-Resonance (NQR) studies. Measurements of an NQR spectrum
and nuclear-spin-lattice-relaxation rate $1/T_1$ have revealed that
antiferromagnetism induced by the Cd-doping emerges locally around Cd dopants,
but superconductivity is suddenly induced at $T_c$ = 0.7 and 0.9 K at 2.34 and
2.75 GPa, respectively. The unique superconducting characteristics with a large
fraction of the residual density of state at the Fermi level that increases
with $T_c$ differ from those for anisotropic superconductivity mediated by
antiferromagnetic correlations. By incorporating the pressure dependence of the
NQR frequency pointing to the valence change of Ce, we suggest that
unconventional superconductivity in the CeIr(In$_{1-x}$Cd$_{x}$)$_5$ system may
be mediated by valence fluctuations.

quantities assuming that the particle and surface are characterized by the

interactions, play an important role in the spread of sexually transmitted
infections. Unfortunately, that kind of data is very hard to obtain. One of the
few exceptions is the ""Romantic network"" which is a complete structure of a
real sexual network of a high school. In terms of topology, unlike other sexual
networks classified as scale-free network. Regarding the temporal structure,
several studies indicate that relationship timing can have effects on diffusion
through networks, as relationship order determines transmission routes.With the
aim to check if the particular structure, static and dynamic, of the Romantic
network is determinant for the propagation of an STI in it, we perform
simulations in two scenarios: the static network where all contacts are
available and the dynamic case where contacts evolve in time. In the static
case, we compare the epidemic results in the Romantic network with some
paradigmatic topologies. We further study the behavior of the epidemic on the
Romantic network in response to the effect of any individual, belonging to the
network, having a contact with an external infected subject, the influence of
the degree of the initial infected, and the effect of the variability of
contacts per unit time. We also consider the dynamics of formation of pairs in
and we study the propagation of the diseases in this dynamic scenario. Our
results suggest that while the Romantic network can not be labeled as a
Watts-Strogatz network, it is, regarding the propagation of an STI, very close
to one with high disorder. Our simulations confirm that relationship timing
affects, but strongly lowering, the final outbreak size. Besides, shows a clear
correlation between the average degree and the outbreak size over time.

the modern world. Many of these features are primarily integrated with the
mobile operating system which is out of reach to public, by which the users
can't manipulate those features. Google came up with an innovative operation
system termed as ANDROID, which is open system architecture with customizable
third party development and debugging environment which helps the user's to
manipulate the features and to create their own customizable applications. In
this paper, 'Emergency Based Remote Collateral Tracking System' application
using Google's Android Mobile Platform is addressed. Emergency is divided into
three categories: heart beat based emergency, security threats like personal
safety and road accidents. This application is targeted to a person who is
driving a vehicle. Heart rate monitoring device is integrated with our
application to sense the heart beat of a person driving the vehicle and if
there is any abnormalities in the heart beat, then our application performs a
dual role. One in which, application uses a GPS to track the location
information of the user and send those location information as a message via
SMS, email and post it on Facebook wall Simultaneously, an emergency signal is
sent to Arduino Microcontroller.This application is written in JAVA programming
language which runs on Eclipse Integrated Development Kit.

general formalism of non-equilibrium thermodynamics at a level adequate for
advanced undergraduates. In a first approach to the problem, the
phenomenological kinetic equation of an elementary first order reaction is used
to show that entropy production is always positive. A second approach assumes
that the reaction is near equilibrium to prove that the entropy generated is
always greater than zero, without any reference to the kinetics of the
reaction. Finally, it is shown that entropy generation is related to
fluctuations in the number of particles at equilibrium, i.e. it is associated
to a microscopic process.
