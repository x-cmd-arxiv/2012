late-B stars with HgMn peculiarity in binary systems has been controversial
during the two last decades.
  We re-analyse available spectropolarimetric material by applying the moment
technique on spectral lines of inhomogeneously distributed elements separately.
Furthermore, we present new determinations of the mean longitudinal magnetic
field for the HgMn star HD65949 and the hotter analog of HgMn stars, the PGa
star HD19400, using FORS2 installed at the VLT. We also give new measurements
of the eclipsing system AR Aur with a primary star of HgMn peculiarity which
were obtained with the SOFIN spectropolarimeter installed at the Nordic Optical
Telescope.
  We downloaded from the ESO archive the publically available HARPS spectra for
eight HgMn stars and one normal and one superficially normal B-type star
obtained in 2010. The application of the moment technique to the HARPS and
SOFIN spectra allowed us to study the presence of the longitudinal magnetic
field, the crossover effect, and quadratic magnetic fields. Results for the
HgMn star HD65949 and the PGa star HD19400 are based on a linear regression
analysis of low-resolution spectra obtained with FORS2 in spectropolarimetric
mode.
  Our measurements of the magnetic field with the moment technique using
spectral lines of several elements separately reveal the presence of a weak
longitudinal magnetic field, a quadratic magnetic field, and the crossover
effect on the surface of several HgMn stars as well as normal and superficially
normal B-type stars. Furthermore, our analysis suggests the existence of
intriguing correlations between the strength of the magnetic field, abundance
anomalies, and binary properties.

state at T* = 31(2) K, twice the spin-glass-like freezing temperature T_f =
16(1) K. The susceptibility becomes field dependent below T*, but no sharp
anomaly is observed in any bulk property. A similar transition is observed in
muSR data from the spin-1 isomorph NiGa2S4. In both compounds the dynamic muon
spin relaxation rate lambda_d(T) above T* agrees well with a calculation of
spin-lattice relaxation by Chubukov, Sachdev, and Senthil in the renormalized
classical regime of a 2D frustrated quantum antiferromagnet. There is no firm
evidence for other mechanisms. At low temperatures lambda_d(T) becomes
temperature independent in both compounds, indicating persistence of spin
dynamics. Scaling of lambda_d(T) between the two compounds is observed from
~T_f to ~1.5T*. Although the muSR data by themselves cannot exclude a truly
static spin component below T*, together with the susceptibility data they are
consistent with a slowly-fluctuating ""spin gel"" regime between T_f and T*. Such
a regime and the absence of a divergence in lambda_d(T) at T* are features of
two unconventional mechanisms: (1) binding/unbinding of Z_2 vortex excitations,
and (2) impurity spins in a nonmagnetic spin-nematic ground state. The absence
of a sharp anomaly or history dependence at T* in the susceptibility of
FeGa2S4, and the weakness of such phenomena in NiGa2S4, strongly suggest
transitions to low-temperature phases with unconventional dynamics.

of positive definite functions, and their reproducing kernels, on the one hand,
and Gaussian stochastic processes, on the other. This central theme is
motivated by a host of applications, e.g., in mathematical physics, and in
stochastic differential equations, and their use in financial models. In this
paper, we show that, for three classes of cases in the correspondence, it is
possible to obtain explicit formulas which are amenable to computations of the
respective Gaussian stochastic processes. For achieving this, we first develop
two functional analytic tools. They are: $(i)$ an identification of a universal
sample space $\Omega$ where we may realize the particular Gaussian processes in
the correspondence; and (ii) a procedure for discretizing computations in
$\Omega$. The three classes of processes we study are as follows: Processes
associated with: (a) arbitrarily given sigma finite regular measures on a fixed
Borel measure space; (b) with Hilbert spaces of sigma-functions; and (c) with
systems of self-similar measures arising in the theory of iterated function
systems. Even our results in (a) go beyond what has been obtained previously,
in that earlier studies have focused on more narrow classes of measures,
typically Borel measures on $\mathbb R^n$. In our last theorem (section 10),
starting with a non-degenerate positive definite function $K$ on some fixed set
$T$, we show that there is a choice of a universal sample space $\Omega$, which
can be realized as a ""boundary"" of $(T, K)$. Its boundary-theoretic properties
are analyzed, and we point out their relevance to the study of electrical
networks on countable infinite graphs.

motion of the current carriers, as has been pre- viously established. However,
spreading for strong guide fields is bi-directional and is due to the

the X-line spreads bi-directionally with a speed governed by the faster of the

  random fields","124 pages. PhD thesis Humboldt-Universit\""at zu Berlin, 2010",,,,"math.ST math.PR stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we study adaptive nonparametric regression with noise
misspecification and the complexity of approximation of random fields in
dependence of the dimension.
  First, we consider the problem of pointwise estimation in nonparametric
regression with heteroscedastic additive Gaussian noise. We use the method of
local approximation applying the Lepski method for selecting one estimate from
the set of linear estimates obtained by the different degrees of localization.
This approach is combined with the ""propagation conditions"" on the choice of
critical values of the procedure, as suggested recently by Spokoiny and Vial
[Ann.Stat., 2009]. The ""propagation conditions"" are relaxed for the model with
misspecified covariance structure. We show that this procedure allows a
misspecification of the covariance matrix with a relative error of order 1/
log(n), where n is the sample size. The quality of estimation is measured in
terms of ""oracle"" risk bounds.
  We then turn to the approximation of d-parametric random fields of tensor
product-type by means of n-term partial sums of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion.
The analysis is restricted to the average case setting. The quantity of
interest is the information complexity describing the minimal number of terms
in the partial sums, which guarantees an error not exceeding a given level. The
behavior of this quantity when the dimension goes to infinity is the subject of
our study.

  Bounded-Degree Graphs","16 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a gossip protocol called forwarding without repeating (FWR). The
objective is to spread multiple rumors over a graph as efficiently as possible.
FWR accomplishes this by having nodes record which messages they have forwarded
to each neighbor, so that each message is forwarded at most once to each
neighbor. We prove that FWR spreads a rumor over a strongly connected digraph,
with high probability, in time which is within a constant factor of optimal for
digraphs with bounded out-degree. Moreover, on digraphs with bounded out-degree
and bounded number of rumors, the number of transmissions required by FWR is
arbitrarily better than that of existing approaches. Specifically, FWR requires
O(n) messages on bounded-degree graphs with n nodes, whereas classical
forwarding and an approach based on network coding both require {\omega}(n)
messages. Our results are obtained using combinatorial and probabilistic
arguments. Notably, they do not depend on expansion properties of the
underlying graph, and consequently the message complexity of FWR is arbitrarily
better than classical forwarding even on constant-degree expander graphs, as n
\rightarrow \infty. In resource-constrained applications, where each
transmission consumes battery power and bandwidth, our results suggest that
using a small amount of memory at each node leads to a significant savings.

N-particle quantum level, adding an additional harmonic confinement leads to a
simple signature to distinguish quantum superpositions from statistical
mixtures. While the non-linear character of the GPE does not allow quantum
superpositions, the splitting of GPE-solitons takes place only partially. When
the potential strength is increased, the fraction of the soliton which is

similar to that of atoms in optical cavities [1, 2], in which the resonant
cavity confines photons and promotes strong light-matter interactions. The
cavity end-mirrors determine the performance of the coupled system, with higher
mirror reflectivity yielding better quantum coherence, but higher mirror
transparency giving improved measurement and control, forcing a compromise. An
alternative is to control the mirror transparency, enabling switching between
long photon lifetime during quantum interactions and large signal strength when
performing measurements. Here we demonstrate the superconducting analogue,
using a quantum system comprising a resonator and a qubit, with variable
coupling to a measurement transmission line. The coupling can be adjusted
through zero to a photon emission rate 1,000 times the intrinsic photon decay
rate. We use this system to control photons in coherent states as well as in
non-classical Fock states, and dynamically shape the waveform of released

thermal loop resummation are applied to obtain a finite result in a
gauge-invariant way that is consistent to leading order in the strong gauge

temperature for both axions and saxions. For the generic case in which saxion
decays into axions are possible, the emitted axions can constitute extra
radiation already prior to big bang nucleosynthesis and well thereafter. We
update associated limits imposed by recent studies of the primordial helium-4
abundance and by precision cosmology of the cosmic microwave background and
large scale structure. We show that the trend towards extra radiation seen in
those studies can be explained by late decays of thermal saxions into axions
and that upcoming Planck results will probe supersymmetric axion models with
unprecedented sensitivity.

us to recursively use our local reconstructor for $(k-1)$-connectivity to
obtain a local reconstructor for $k$-connectivity.

orbital eccentricities of giant planets, can be explained if the early Solar
System evolved through a dynamical instability followed by migration of planets
in the planetesimal disk. Here we report the results of a statistical study, in
which we performed nearly 10^4 numerical simulations of planetary instability
starting from hundreds of different initial conditions. We found that the
dynamical evolution is typically too violent, if Jupiter and Saturn start in
the 3:2 resonance, leading to ejection of at least one ice giant from the Solar
System. Planet ejection can be avoided if the mass of the transplanetary disk
of planetesimals was large (M_disk>50 M_Earth), but we found that a massive
disk would lead to excessive dynamical damping (e.g., final e_55 < 0.01
compared to present e_55=0.044, where e_55 is the amplitude of the fifth
eccentric mode in the Jupiter's orbit), and to smooth migration that violates
constraints from the survival of the terrestrial planets. Better results were
obtained when the Solar System was assumed to have five giant planets initially
and one ice giant, with the mass comparable to that of Uranus and Neptune, was
ejected into interstellar space by Jupiter. The best results were obtained when
the ejected planet was placed into the external 3:2 or 4:3 resonance with
Saturn and M_disk ~ 20 M_Earth. The range of possible outcomes is rather broad
in this case, indicating that the present Solar System is neither a typical nor
expected result for a given initial state, and occurs, in best cases, with only
a ~5% probability (as defined by the success criteria described in the main
text). The case with six giant planets shows interesting dynamics but does
offer significant advantages relative to the five planet case.

enough that it should cool radiatively in the cluster's lifetime, leading to

cool gas masses for these ""cool core"" clusters suggest that much of the cooling
must be offset by astrophysical feedback to prevent the formation of a runaway
cooling flow. Here we report X-ray, optical, and infrared observations of the

exceptionally luminous (L_2-10 keV = 8.2 x 10^45 erg/s) galaxy cluster which
hosts an extremely strong cooling flow (dM/dt = 3820 +/- 530 Msun/yr). Further,
the central galaxy in this cluster appears to be experiencing a massive

yet be fully established in SPT-CLJ2344-4243. This large star formation rate

naturally at the high-density end of the hierarchy of the interstellar medium
(ISM). Due to short free-fall times, these high-density regions achieve high
local star formation efficiencies, enabling them to form bound clusters.
Star-forming regions of lower density remain substructured and gas-rich, ending
up unbound when the residual gas is expelled. Additionally, the tidal
perturbation of star-forming regions by nearby, dense giant molecular clouds
imposes a minimum density contrast required for the collapse to a bound
cluster. The fraction of all star formation that occurs in bound stellar
clusters (the cluster formation efficiency or CFE) follows by integration of
these local clustering and survival properties over the full density spectrum
of the ISM, and hence is set by galaxy-scale physics. We derive the CFE as a
function of observable galaxy properties, and find that it increases with the
gas surface density, from ~1% in low-density galaxies to a peak value of ~70%
at densities of ~10^3 Msun pc^-2. This explains the observation that the CFE
increases with the star formation rate density in nearby dwarf, spiral, and
starburst galaxies. Indeed, comparing our model results with observed galaxies
yields excellent agreement. The model is applied further by calculating the
spatial variation of the CFE within single galaxies. We also consider the
variation of the CFE with cosmic time and show that it increases with redshift,
peaking in high-redshift, gas-rich disc galaxies. It is estimated that up to
30-35% of all stars in the Universe once formed in bound stellar clusters. We
discuss how our theory can be verified with Gaia and ALMA, and provide
implementations for future theoretical work and for simulations of galaxy

for the decay energy of the unbound nuclei to be reconstructed. A low energy
resonance, $<$ 200 keV, was observed for the first time in the $^{24}$O + n + n
system and assigned to the ground state of $^{26}$O. The $^{16}$Be ground state
resonance was observed at 1.35 MeV. The 3-body correlations of the $^{14}$Be +
n + n system were compared to simulations of a phase-space, sequential, and
dineutron decay. The strong correlations in the n-n system from the
experimental data could only be reproduced by the dineutron decay simulation
providing the first evidence for a dineutron-like decay.

performance of Galois connections (Logic J. of the IGPL, 18:837-858, 2010). In
this paper, the extensions Int2GC and Int2GC+FS of IntGC are studied. Int2GC
can be seen as a fusion of two IntGC logics, and Int2GC+FS is obtained from
Int2GC by adding instances of duality-like connections $\Diamond(A \to\ B) \to
(\Box A \to \Diamond B)$ and $(\Diamond A \to \Box B) \to \Box(A \to B)$,
introduced by G. Fischer Servi (Rend. Sem. Mat. Univers. Politecn. Torino,

Kripke-style and algebraic semantics are presented for Int2GC and Int2GC+FS,
and the logics are proved to be complete with respect to both of these
semantics. We show that rough lattice-valued fuzzy sets defined on complete
Heyting algebras are proper algebraic models for Int2GC+FS. We also prove that
Int2GC+FS is equivalent to the intuitionistic tense logic IKt, and an
axiomatisation of IKt with the number of axioms reduced to the half of the

various candidate cost functions are investigated concerning their suitability

how the cost function based approach can be used to aid wireless network design

telecommunications wavelengths, the silicon nanophotonic integrated circuit
platform has recently proven its merits for working with mid-infrared (mid-IR)
optical signals in the 2-8 {\mu}m range. Mid-IR integrated optical systems are
capable of addressing applications including industrial process and
environmental monitoring, threat detection, medical diagnostics, and free-space
communication. Rapid progress has led to the demonstration of various silicon
components designed for the on-chip processing of mid-IR signals, including
waveguides, vertical grating couplers, microcavities, and electrooptic
modulators. Even so, a notable obstacle to the continued advancement of
chip-scale systems is imposed by the narrow-bandgap semiconductors, such as
InSb and HgCdTe, traditionally used to convert mid-IR photons to electrical
currents. The cryogenic or multi-stage thermo-electric cooling required to
suppress dark current noise, exponentially dependent upon the ratio Eg/kT, can
limit the development of small, low-power, and low-cost integrated optical
systems for the mid-IR. However, if the mid-IR optical signal could be
spectrally translated to shorter wavelengths, for example within the
near-infrared telecom band, photodetectors using wider bandgap semiconductors
such as InGaAs or Ge could be used to eliminate prohibitive cooling
requirements. Moreover, telecom band detectors typically perform with higher
detectivity and faster response times when compared with their mid-IR
counterparts. Here we address these challenges with a silicon-integrated
approach to spectral translation, by employing efficient four-wave mixing (FWM)
and large optical parametric gain in silicon nanophotonic wires.

and gene networks are examples of biological systems that share some features
of complex networks, such as highly connected nodes, modularity, and
small-world topology. Recent studies indicate that some pathologies present
topological network alterations relative to norms seen in the general
population. Therefore, methods to discriminate the processes that generate the
different classes of networks (e.g., normal and disease) might be crucial for
the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disease. It is known that
several topological properties of a network (graph) can be described by the
distribution of the spectrum of its adjacency matrix. Moreover, large networks
generated by the same random process have the same spectrum distribution,
allowing us to use it as a ""fingerprint"". Based on this relationship, we
introduce and propose the entropy of a graph spectrum to measure the
""uncertainty"" of a random graph and the Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon
divergences between graph spectra to compare networks. We also introduce
general methods for model selection and network model parameter estimation, as
well as a statistical procedure to test the nullity of divergence between two
classes of complex networks. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the
proposed methods by applying them on (1) protein-protein interaction networks
of different species and (2) on networks derived from children diagnosed with
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and typically developing
children. We conclude that scale-free networks best describe all the
protein-protein interactions. Also, we show that our proposed measures
succeeded in the identification of topological changes in the network while
other commonly used measures (number of edges, clustering coefficient, average
path length) failed.

multivariate longitudinal data. Discovering such dependence is challenging due
to the dimensionality involved. By concatenating the random effects from
component models for each response, dependence within and across longitudinal
responses can be characterized through a large random effects covariance
matrix. Motivated by the common problems in estimating this matrix, especially
the off-diagonal elements, we propose a Bayesian approach that relies on
shrinkage priors for parameters in a modified Cholesky decomposition. Without
adjustment, such priors and previous related approaches are order-dependent and
tend to shrink strongly toward an ARtype structure. We propose moment-matching
(MM) priors to mitigate such problems. Efficient Gibbs samplers are developed
for posterior computation. The methods are illustrated through simulated
examples and are applied to a longitudinal epidemiologic study of hormones and

positive correlation between the fluctuation in the production probability of

galactic nuclei (AGN) and a photo-ionizing background at high redshifts - on
the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) mass function, the $b_{\rm J}$ band luminosity
function, and the spatial clustering of these galaxies at $z$=0. We use a
version of the semi-analytical galaxy formation model GALFORM that calculates
self-consistently the amount of HI in a galaxy as a function of cosmic time and
links its star formation rate to its mass of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$). We
find that a systematic increase or decrease in the strength of SNe feedback
leads to a systematic decrease or increase in the amplitudes of the luminosity
and HI mass functions, but has little influence on their overall shapes.
Varying the strength of AGN feedback influences only the numbers of the
brightest or most HI massive galaxies, while the impact of varying the strength
of photo-ionization feedback is restricted to changing the numbers of the
faintest or least HI massive galaxies.Our results suggest that the HI mass
function is a more sensitive probe of the consequences of cosmological
reionization for galaxy formation than the luminosity function. We find that
increasing the strength of any of the modes of feedback acts to weaken the
clustering strength of galaxies, regardless of their HI-richness. In contrast,
weaker AGN feedback has little effect on the clustering strength whereas weaker
SNe feedback increases the clustering strength of HI-poor galaxies more
strongly than HI-rich galaxies. These results indicate that forthcoming HI
surveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array
and its pathfinders will be exploited most fruitfully as part of
multiwavelength survey campaigns.

transit-like features every 15.7 hours that vary in depth between 0.2% and
1.2%. Rappaport et al. (2012) explain the observations in terms of a
disintegrating, rocky planet that has a trailing cloud of dust created and
constantly replenished by thermal surface erosion. The variability of the
transit depth is then a consequence of changes in the cloud optical depth.
Aims. We aim to validate the disintegrating-planet scenario by modeling the
detailed shape of the observed light curve, and thereby constrain the cloud
particle properties to better understand the nature of this intriguing object.
Methods. We analysed the six publicly-available quarters of raw Kepler data,
phase-folded the light curve and fitted it to a model for the trailing dust
cloud. Constraints on the particle properties were investigated with a
light-scattering code. Results. The light curve exhibits clear signatures of
light scattering and absorption by dust, including a brightening in flux just
before ingress correlated with the transit depth and explained by forward
scattering, and an asymmetry in the transit light curve shape, which is easily
reproduced by an exponentially decaying distribution of optically thin dust,
with a typical grain size of 0.1 micron. Conclusions. Our quantitative analysis
supports the hypothesis that the transit signal of KIC 12557548 b is due to a
variable cloud of dust, most likely originating from a disintegrating object.

shears and redshifts to constrain cosmological parameters, we ask how well the
shears around clusters can constrain the redshifts, assuming fixed cosmological
parameters. This provides a check on photometric redshifts, independent of
source spectral energy distribution properties and therefore free of
confounding factors such as misidentification of spectral breaks. We find that
~40 massive ($\sigma_v=1200$ km/s) cluster lenses are sufficient to determine
the fraction of sources in each of six coarse redshift bins to ~11%, given weak
(20%) priors on the masses of the highest-redshift lenses, tight (5%) priors on
the masses of the lowest-redshift lenses, and only modest (20-50%) priors on
calibration and evolution effects. Additional massive lenses drive down
uncertainties as $N_{lens}^0.5$, but the improvement slows as one is forced to
use lenses further down the mass function. Future large surveys contain enough
clusters to reach 1% precision in the bin fractions if the tight lens mass
priors can be maintained for large samples of lenses. In practice this will be
difficult to achieve, but the method may be valuable as a complement to other
more precise methods because it is based on different physics and therefore has
different systematic errors.

The cells of multicellular organisms, in contrast to unicellular organisms, are
burdened with a two- part genome: housekeeping and specialized (multicellular),
responsible for ontogenesis and terminal differentiation. The two parts of the
genome compete for limited adaptive resources thereby interfering with the
ability of the house-keeping part of the genome to adequately perform
reparative and adaptive functions in post mitotic cells. The necessity to
complete the ontgenesis program, leads to increased activity of the
multicellular components of the genome. As a result, the allocation of cellular
resources to specialized genome con-tinuously increases with time. This leads
to a deficit of reparative and adaptive capacity in post mitotic cells.
Suggestions for future research focus on identifying groups of genes
responsible for regulation of growth rate of specialized genome and suppressing
ability of the cell division. A better understanding of the relationship
between the two parts of the genome will not only help us to manipulate
ontogenesis and aging, but will also improve our understanding of cancer
development and ontogenesis.

The eigenvalues of the light-front QCD Hamiltonian predict the hadron spectrum

hadron structure. More generally, we show that the valence Fock-state
wavefunctions of the light-front QCD Hamiltonian satisfy a single-variable
relativistic equation of motion, analogous to the nonrelativistic radial
Schr\""odinger equation, with an effective confining potential U which
systematically incorporates the effects of higher quark and gluon Fock states.
We outline a method for computing the required potential from first principles

fixed light-front time, yields the same light front Schr\""odinger equation; in
fact, the soft-wall AdS/QCD approach provides a model for the light-front
potential which is color-confining and reproduces well the light-hadron

between the bound-state amplitudes in the fifth dimension of AdS space and the
boost-invariant light-front wavefunctions describing the internal structure of
hadrons in physical space-time. The elastic and transition form factors of the

base-stations are connected to a centralized processing server via rate-limited
digital backhaul links. Unlike previous studies where the centralized processor
jointly decodes all the source messages from all base-stations, this paper
proposes a suboptimal achievability scheme in which the Wyner-Ziv
compress-and-forward relaying technique is employed on a per-base-station
basis, but successive interference cancellation (SIC) is used at the central
processor to mitigate multicell interference. This results in an achievable
rate region that is easily computable, in contrast to the joint processing
schemes in which the rate regions can only be characterized by exponential
number of rate constraints. Under the per-base-station SIC framework, this
paper further studies the impact of the limited-capacity backhaul links on the
achievable rates and establishes that in order to achieve to within constant
number of bits to the maximal SIC rate with infinite-capacity backhaul, the
backhaul capacity must scale logarithmically with the
signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at each base-station. Finally,
this paper studies the optimal backhaul rate allocation problem for an uplink
multicell joint processing model with a total backhaul capacity constraint. The
analysis reveals that the optimal strategy that maximizes the overall sum rate
should also scale with the log of the SINR at each base-station.

halos from the scales of spiral galaxies to galaxy clusters, focusing
explicitly on models with cross sections over dark matter particle mass
\sigma/m = 1 and 0.1 cm^2/g. Our simulations rely on a new SIDM N-body
algorithm that is derived self-consistently from the Boltzmann equation and
that reproduces analytic expectations in controlled numerical experiments. We
find that well-resolved SIDM halos have constant-density cores, with
significantly lower central densities than their CDM counterparts. In contrast,
the subhalo content of SIDM halos is only modestly reduced compared to CDM,
with the suppression greatest for large hosts and small halo-centric distances.
Moreover, the large-scale clustering and halo circular velocity functions in
SIDM are effectively identical to CDM, meaning that all of the large-scale
successes of CDM are equally well matched by SIDM. From our largest cross
section runs we are able to extract scaling relations for core sizes and
central densities over a range of halo sizes and find a strong correlation
between the core radius of an SIDM halo and the NFW scale radius of its CDM
counterpart. We construct a simple analytic model, based on CDM scaling
relations, that captures all aspects of the scaling relations for SIDM halos.
Our results show that halo core densities in \sigma/m = 1 cm^2/g models are too
low to match observations of galaxy clusters, low surface brightness spirals
(LSBs), and dwarf spheroidal galaxies. However, SIDM with \sigma/m ~ 0.1 cm^2/g
appears capable of reproducing reported core sizes and central densities of
dwarfs, LSBs, and galaxy clusters without the need for velocity dependence.

interactions among dark-matter particles will drive galaxy and cluster halos to
become spherical in their centers. Work in the past has used this effect to
rule out velocity-independent, elastic cross sections larger than sigma/m ~
0.02 cm^2/g based on comparisons to the shapes of galaxy cluster lensing
potentials and X-ray isophotes. In this paper, we use cosmological simulations
to show that these constraints were off by more than an order of magnitude
because (a) they did not properly account for the fact that the observed
ellipticity gets contributions from the triaxial mass distribution outside the
core set by scatterings, (b) the scatter in axis ratios is large and (c) the
core region retains more of its triaxial nature than estimated before.
Including these effects properly shows that the same observations now allow
dark matter self-interaction cross sections at least as large as sigma/m = 0.1
cm^2/g. We show that constraints on self-interacting dark matter from
strong-lensing clusters are likely to improve significantly in the near future,
but possibly more via central densities and core sizes than halo shapes.

(M2M) communications. Particularly, in event-driven M2M communications, a large
number of devices activate within a short period of time, which in turn causes
high radio congestions and severe access delay. To address this issue, we
propose a Fast Adaptive S-ALOHA (FASA) scheme for random access control of M2M
communication systems with bursty traffic. Instead of the observation in a
single slot, the statistics of consecutive idle and collision slots are used in
FASA to accelerate the tracking process of network status which is critical for
optimizing S-ALOHA systems. Using drift analysis, we design the FASA scheme
such that the estimate of the backlogged devices converges fast to the true
value. Furthermore, by examining the $T$-slot drifts, we prove that the
proposed FASA scheme is stable as long as the average arrival rate is smaller
than $e^{-1}$, in the sense that the Markov Chain derived from the scheme is
geometrically ergodic. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FASA
scheme outperforms traditional additive schemes such as PB-ALOHA and achieves
near-optimal performance in reducing access delay. Moreover, compared to
multiplicative schemes, FASA shows its robustness under heavy traffic load in
addition to better delay performance.

enhance (suppress) the charge current when the magnetization of the leads are

inter-edge coupling generally reduces the current by backscattering regardless

(which equals the Riemann tensor in vacuum) splits into two spatial, symmetric,
traceless tensors: the tidal field $E$, which produces tidal forces, and the
frame-drag field $B$, which produces differential frame dragging. In recent
papers, we and colleagues have introduced ways to visualize these two fields:
tidal tendex lines (integral curves of the three eigenvector fields of $E$) and
their tendicities (eigenvalues of these eigenvector fields); and the
corresponding entities for the frame-drag field: frame-drag vortex lines and
their vorticities. These entities fully characterize the vacuum Riemann tensor.
In this paper, we compute and depict the tendex and vortex lines, and their
tendicities and vorticities, outside the horizons of stationary (Schwarzschild
and Kerr) black holes; and we introduce and depict the black holes' horizon
tendicity and vorticity (the normal-normal components of $E$ and $B$ on the
horizon). For Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, the horizon tendicity is
proportional to the horizon's intrinsic scalar curvature, and the horizon
vorticity is proportional to an extrinsic scalar curvature. We show that, for
horizon-penetrating time slices, all these entities ($E$, $B$, the tendex lines
and vortex lines, the lines' tendicities and vorticities, and the horizon
tendicities and vorticities) are affected only weakly by changes of slicing and
changes of spatial coordinates, within those slicing and coordinate choices

that explicitly supports unfolding chains of discovery, with acquisition,
cataloging, and modeling of data not seen as isolated tasks, but rather as
parts of an ongoing, integrated sequence of analyses, with information and

viscoelasticity of the dilute two-layer-vesicle suspension. It is found that
for small gap, the applied shear drives the undulation mode strongly while the
slow squeezing mode is not much excited. In this limit the complex viscosity is
dominated by the fast mode contribution. On the other hand, the slow mode is
strongly driven by shear for larger gap. We have determined the crossover gap

mode indexes (n,l,m), and parity, which can be electric [(-1)^l] or magnetic
[(-1)^(l+1)]. Among our discoveries are these: (i) There is a near duality
between modes of the same (n,l,m): a duality in which the tendex and vortex
structures of electric-parity modes are interchanged with the vortex and tendex
structures (respectively) of magnetic-parity modes. (ii) This near duality is
perfect for the modes' complex eigenfrequencies (which are well known to be
identical) and perfect on the horizon; it is slightly broken in the equatorial
plane of a non-spinning hole, and the breaking becomes greater out of the
equatorial plane, and greater as the hole is spun up; but even out of the plane
for fast-spinning holes, the duality is surprisingly good. (iii)
Electric-parity modes can be regarded as generated by 3-D tendexes that stick
radially out of the horizon. As these ""longitudinal,"" near-zone tendexes rotate
or oscillate, they generate longitudinal-transverse near-zone vortexes and
tendexes, and outgoing and ingoing gravitational waves. The ingoing waves act
back on the longitudinal tendexes, driving them to slide off the horizon, which
results in decay of the mode's strength. (iv) By duality, magnetic-parity modes
are driven in this same manner by longitudinal, near-zone vortexes that stick
out of the horizon. [Abstract abridged.]

attractive interactions is a convex function of the fractional particle number
N and is given by a series of straight lines joining a subset of ground-state
energies. As a consequence the exchange-correlation (XC) potential is not
discontinuous for all N. We highlight the importance of this exact result in
the ensemble-DFT description of the negative-U Anderson model. In the atomic
limit the discontinuity of the XC potential is missing for odd N while for
finite hybridizations the discontinuity at even N is broadened. We demonstrate
that the inclusion of these properties in any approximate XC potential is
crucial to reproduce the characteristic signatures of the charge-Kondo effect

consist of a simple exponential thick disk model, and updated versions of the
models by Taylor & Cordes and Cordes & Lazio with more extended thick disks.
The final model we introduce uses the observed H-alpha intensity as a proxy for
the total electron column density, also known as the dispersion measure (DM).
We use the latest available data sets of pulsars with accurate distances
(through parallax measurements or association with globular clusters) to
optimise the parameters in these models. In the process of fitting a new scale
height for the thick disk in the model by Cordes & Lazio we discuss why this
thick disk cannot be replaced by the thick disk that Gaensler et al. advocated
in a recent paper. In the second part of our paper we test how well the
different models can predict the DMs of these pulsars at known distances.
Almost all models perform well, in that they predict DMs within a factor of
1.5-2 of the observed DMs for about 75% of the lines of sight. This is somewhat
surprising since the models we tested range from very simple models that only
contain a single exponential thick disk to very complex models like the model
by Cordes & Lazio. We show that the model by Taylor & Cordes that we updated
with a more extended thick disk consistently performs better than the other
models we tested. Finally, we analyse which sightlines have DMs that prove
difficult to predict by most models, which indicates the presence of local
features in the ISM between us and the pulsar. (abridged)

the proper motions of ~113500 stars using a 23-year baseline. The proper
motions will use the Hipparcos data, with epoch 1991.25, as first epoch and the
first intermediate-release Gaia astrometry, with epoch ~2014.5, as second
epoch. The expected HTPM proper-motion standard errors are 30-190 muas/yr,
depending on stellar magnitude. Depending on the characteristics of an object,
in particular its distance and velocity, its radial velocity can have a
significant impact on the determination of its proper motion. The impact of
this perspective acceleration is largest for fast-moving, nearby stars. Our
goal is to determine, for each star in the Hipparcos catalogue, the
radial-velocity standard error that is required to guarantee a negligible
contribution of perspective acceleration to the HTPM proper-motion precision.
We employ two evaluation criteria, both based on Monte-Carlo simulations, with
which we determine which stars need to be spectroscopically (re-)measured. Both
criteria take the Hipparcos measurement errors into account. For each star in
the Hipparcos catalogue, we determine the confidence level with which the
available radial velocity and its standard error, taken from the XHIP
compilation catalogue, are acceptable. We find that for 97 stars, the radial
velocities available in the literature are insufficiently precise for a 68.27%
confidence level. We also identify 109 stars for which radial velocities are
currently unknown yet need to be acquired to meet the 68.27% confidence level.
To satisfy the radial-velocity requirements coming from our study will be a
daunting task consuming a significant amount of spectroscopic telescope time.
Fortunately, the follow-up spectroscopy is not time-critical since the HTPM
proper motions can be corrected a posteriori once (improved) radial velocities
become available.

with capacities. Our goal is to select k centers in a graph, and assign each
node to a nearby center, so that we respect the capacity constraints on
centers. The objective is to minimize the maximum distance a node has to travel
to get to its assigned center. This problem is NP-hard, even when centers have
no capacity restrictions and optimal factor 2 approximation algorithms are
known. With capacities, when all centers have identical capacities, a 6
approximation is known with no better lower bounds than for the infinite
capacity version.
  While many generalizations and variations of this problem have been studied
extensively, no progress was made on the capacitated version for a general
capacity function. We develop the first constant factor approximation algorithm
for this problem. Our algorithm uses an LP rounding approach to solve this
problem, and works for the case of non-uniform hard capacities, when multiple
copies of a node may not be chosen and can be extended to the case when there
is a hard bound on the number of copies of a node that may be selected. In
addition we establish a lower bound on the integrality gap of 7(5) for
non-uniform (uniform) hard capacities. In addition we prove that if there is a
(3-eps)-factor approximation for this problem then P=NP.
  Finally, for non-uniform soft capacities we present a much simpler
11-approximation algorithm, which we find as one more evidence that hard
capacities are much harder to deal with.

applications and domains, ever since it first proved to be effective in
determining node importance in large graphs (and was a pioneering idea behind
Google's search engine). In distributed computing alone, PageRank vector, or
more generally random walk based quantities have been used for several
different applications ranging from determining important nodes, load
balancing, search, and identifying connectivity structures. Surprisingly,
however, there has been little work towards designing provably efficient
fully-distributed algorithms for computing PageRank. The difficulty is that
traditional matrix-vector multiplication style iterative methods may not always
adapt well to the distributed setting owing to communication bandwidth
restrictions and convergence rates.
  In this paper, we present fast random walk-based distributed algorithms for
computing PageRanks in general graphs and prove strong bounds on the round
complexity. We first present a distributed algorithm that takes $O\big(\log
n/\eps \big)$ rounds with high probability on any graph (directed or
undirected), where $n$ is the network size and $\eps$ is the reset probability
used in the PageRank computation (typically $\eps$ is a fixed constant). We
then present a faster algorithm that takes $O\big(\sqrt{\log n}/\eps \big)$
rounds in undirected graphs. Both of the above algorithms are scalable, as each
node sends only small ($\polylog n$) number of bits over each edge per round.
To the best of our knowledge, these are the first fully distributed algorithms
for computing PageRank vector with provably efficient running time.

representative sample of 250 micron selected galaxies spanning the most recent
5 Gyr of cosmic history. We derive estimates of physical parameters, including
star formation rates, stellar masses, dust masses and infrared luminosities.
The typical H-ATLAS galaxy at z < 0.5 has a far-infrared luminosity in the
range 10^10 - 10^12 Lsolar (SFR: 1-50 Msolar/yr) thus is broadly representative
of normal star forming galaxies over this redshift range. We show that 250
micron-selected galaxies contain a larger mass of dust at a given infra-red
luminosity or star formation rate than previous samples selected at 60 micron
from IRAS. We derive typical SEDs for H-ATLAS galaxies, and show that the
emergent SED shape is most sensitive to specific star formation rate. The
optical-UV SEDs also become more reddened due to dust at higher redshifts. Our
template SEDs are significantly cooler than existing infra-red templates. They
may therefore be most appropriate for inferring total IR luminosities from
moderate redshift submillimetre selected samples and for inclusion in models of
the lower redshift submillimetre galaxy populations.

double auction or in other words the order book (OB). It is designed to explain
collective behaviour of the market when new information affecting the market
arrives. The novel feature of the model is two additional slow changing
parameters, the so-called sentiment functions. These sentiment functions
measure the conception of the fair price of two groups of investors, namely,
bulls and bears. Our model specifies differential equations for the time
evolution of sentiment functions and constitutes a nonlinear Markov process
which exhibits long term correlations. We explain the intuition behind
equations for sentiment functions and present numerical simulations which show
that the behaviour of our model is similar to the behaviour of the real market.
We also obtain a diffusion limit of the model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type
process with variable volatility. The volatility is proportional to the
difference of opinions of bulls and bears about the fair price of a security.
The paper is complimentary to our previous work where mathematical proofs are
presented.

indexes $L_0$ in a separable Hilbert space ${\cal H}$ we associate a
topological space $\Omega_{L_0}$ ({\it wave spectrum}) constructed from the
reachable sets of a dynamical system governed by the equation
$u_{tt}+(L_0)^*u=0$. Wave spectra of unitary equivalent operators are
homeomorphic.
  In inverse problems, one needs to recover a Riemannian manifold $\Omega$ via
dynamical or spectral boundary data. We show that for a generic class of
manifolds, $\Omega$ is isometric to the wave spectrum $\Omega_{L_0}$ of the
minimal Laplacian $L_0=-\Delta|_{C^\infty_0(\Omega\backslash \partial \Omega)}$
acting in ${\cal H}=L_2(\Omega)$, whereas $L_0$ is determined by the inverse
data up to unitary equivalence. Hence, the manifold can be recovered (up to
isometry) by the scheme `data $\Rightarrow L_0 \Rightarrow \Omega_{L_0}
\overset{\rm isom}= \Omega$'.
  The wave spectrum is relevant to a wide class of dynamical systems, which
describe the finite speed wave propagation processes. The paper elucidates the
operator background of the boundary control method (Belishev`1986), which is an
approach to inverse problems based on their relations to control theory.

an efficient scheduling algorithm which incorporates the needs of the users and
variation in channel condition. The parameters used to measure the efficiency
of the scheduling algorithms are the Jain Fairness Index and the overall system
throughput. In this paper we have proposed a variance based scheduling
algorithm which selects the user who has the highest variance of data
transmitted in a given time frame as a parameter for scheduling. This ensures
that eventually, the users transmit almost equal amounts of data regardless of
channel condition. The simulation results shows that the proposed algorithm
achieves high Jain Fairness Index of 0.92 with a lesser drop in the system

masses. The dust aggregates consisted of micrometer-sized silica particles and
were macroscopically homogeneous. We measured the coefficient of restitution
for collision velocities ranging from 1 cm/s to 0.5 m/s, and determined the
fragmentation velocity. For low velocities, the coefficient of restitution
decreases with increasing impact velocity, in contrast to findings by Beitz et
al. (2011). At higher velocities, the value of the coefficient of restitution
becomes constant, before the aggregates break at the onset of fragmentation. We
interpret the qualitative change in the coefficient of restitution as the
transition from a solid-body-dominated to a granular-medium-dominated behavior.
We complement our experiments by molecular dynamics simulations of porous
aggregates and obtain a reasonable match to the experimental data. We discuss
the importance of our experiments for protoplanetary disks, debris disks, and
planetary rings. The work is an extensional study to previous work of our group
and gives a new insight in the velocity dependency of the coefficient of

For tensile strain a band gap opens due to charge disproportionation at the Ni

the band gap collapses due to overlap of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands through a
semimetallic state. This asymmetry in the electronic behavior is associated
with the difference in octahedral distortions and rotations under tensile and

restored with increasing thickness of the (LaAlO$_3$)$_n$/(LaNiO$_3$)$_n$

we get that the Yoneda algebra of a multi-Koszul algebra is generated in
degrees 1 and 2, so a $\mathcal{K}_{2}$ algebra in the sense of T. Cassidy and
B. Shelton. We also exhibit several examples and we provide a minimal graded
projective resolution of the algebra $A$ considered as an $A$-bimodule, which
may be used to compute the Hochschild (co)homology groups. Finally, we find
necessary and sufficient conditions on some (fixed) sequences of vector
subspaces of the tensor powers of the base space $V$ to obtain in this case the
multi-Koszul property in the case we have relations in only two degrees.

recent numerical simulations revealed that skyrmion magnetic bubbles show
significant deviations from this model. We show that a skyrmion bubble

relations. Several years ago the pioneering works of T. Asano, J. Matousek and
T. Tokuyama introduced ""implicit computational geometry"", in which the
geometric objects are defined by implicit relations involving sets. An
important member in this family is called ""a zone diagram"". The implicit nature
of zone diagrams implies, as already observed in the original works, that their
computation is a challenging task. In a continuous setting this task has been
addressed (briefly) only by these authors in the Euclidean plane with point
sites. We discuss the possibility to compute zone diagrams in a wide class of
spaces and also shed new light on their computation in the original setting.
The class of spaces, which is introduced here, includes, in particular,
Euclidean spheres and finite dimensional strictly convex normed spaces. Sites
of a general form are allowed and it is shown that a generalization of the
iterative method suggested by Asano, Matousek and Tokuyama converges to a
double zone diagram, another implicit geometric object whose existence is known
in general. Occasionally a zone diagram can be obtained from this procedure.
The actual (approximate) computation of the iterations is based on a simple
algorithm which enables the approximate computation of Voronoi diagrams in a
general setting. Our analysis also yields a few byproducts of independent
interest, such as certain topological properties of Voronoi cells (e.g., that
in the considered setting their boundaries cannot be ""fat"").

Terao has shown that each such reflection arrangement A is free. There is the
stronger notion of an inductively free arrangement. In 1992, Orlik and Terao
conjectured that each reflection arrangement is inductively free. It has been
known for quite some time that the braid arrangement as well as the Coxeter
arrangements of type B and type D are inductively free. Barakat and Cuntz
completed this list only recently by showing that every Coxeter arrangement is
inductively free.
  Nevertheless, Orlik and Terao's conjecture is false in general. In a recent
paper, we already gave two counterexamples to this conjecture among the
exceptional complex reflection groups.
  In this paper we classify all inductively free reflection arrangements. In
addition, we show that the notions of inductive freeness and that of hereditary
inductive freeness coincide for reflection arrangements.

application of an electric field, the second band becomes occupied, giving rise
to a strong enhancement of the transition temperature and a sharp feature in
the gap functions, which is manifested in the local density of states spectrum.
By comparing our results with tunneling experiments in Nb-doped SrTiO$_{3}$, we
find that intra-band pairing dominates over inter-band pairing, unlike other
known multi-band superconductors. Given the similarities with the value of the
transition temperature and with the band structure of LaAlO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$

host lattice to Eu3+ ions. X-ray diffraction and microscopy observations
revealed the nanocrystalline nature and a bit elongated morphology of the

spectral profiles. On the basis of the results presented in an earlier study,
we model the CO and 13CO emission in IRC+10420 and compare it to a set of lines
ranging from the mm, to the FIR. Red supergiants have stronger high-excitation
lines than the YHGs, indicating that they harbour dense and hot inner shells
contributing to these transitions. Consequently, these high-J lines in RSGs
originate from acceleration layers that have not yet reached the circumstellar
terminal velocity and have narrower profiles than their flat-topped lower-J
counterparts. The YHGs tend to lack this inner component, in line with the
picture of detached, hollow envelopes derived from studies at longer
wavelengths. NH3 is only detected in two sources (NML Cyg, IRC+10420), which
are also observed to be the strongest water-line emitters of the studied
sample. In contrast, OH is detected in all sources and does not seem to
correlate with the water line intensities. We show that the IRC+10420 model

ensemble of a quark-gluon gas exhibits a $Z(3)$ symmetry through the normaized
character in fundamental representation and also becomes equivalent, within a
stationary point approximation, to the ensemble given by Polyakov Loop. Also
Polyakov Loop gauge potential is obtained by considering spatial gluons along
with the invariant Haar measure at each space point. The probability of the
normalized character in $SU(3)$ vis-a-vis Polyakov Loop is found to be maximum
at a particular value exhibiting a strong color correlation. This clearly
indicates a transition from a color correlated to uncorrelated phase or
vise-versa. When quarks are included to the gauge fields, a metastable state
appears in the temperature range $145\le T({\rm{MeV}}) \le 170$ due to the
explicit $Z(3)$ symmetry breaking in the quark-gluon system. Beyond $T\ge 170$
MeV the metastable state disappears and stable domains appear. At low
temperature a dynamical recombination of ionized $Z(3)$ color charges to a
color singlet $Z(3)$ confined phase is evident along with a confining
background that originates due to circulation of two virtual spatial gluons but
with conjugate $Z(3)$ phases in a closed loop. We also discuss other possible

benchmark processes at the LHC, not only in view of on-going Higgs analyses.
These processes may also help to gain a deeper understanding of the electroweak
interaction in general, and to test the validity of the Standard Model at
highest energies. In this work, the first calculation of the full one-loop
electroweak corrections to on-shell W-boson pair production at hadron colliders
is presented. We discuss the impact of the corrections on the total cross
section as well as on relevant differential distributions. We observe that
corrections due to photon-induced channels can be amazingly large at energies
accessible at the LHC, while radiation of additional massive vector bosons does
not influence the results significantly.

advantage of the proposed system is that the channel frequency responses over
every two adjacent subcarriers become equal. Such interesting result provides
an exceptional operating conditions for SFBC-OFDM systems transmitting over
time and frequencyselective fading channels. Monte Carlo simulation is used to
evaluate the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed system using
various wireless channels with different degrees of frequency selectivity and
Doppler spreads. The simulation results demonstrated that the proposed scheme
substantially outperforms the standard SFBC-OFDM and the space-time block coded
(STBC) OFDM systems in severe time-varying frequency-selective fading channels.
Moreover, the proposed system has very low complexity because it is based on
short block length WHT.

major anonymity for peer-to-peer users concerned with the users' identities and
actions which can be revealed by any other members. There are many approaches
proposed to provide anonymous peer-to-peer communications. An intruder can get
information about the content of the data, the sender's and receiver's
identities. Anonymous approaches are designed with the following three goals:
to protect the identity of provider, to protect the identity of requester and
to protect the contents of transferred data between them. This article presents
a new peer-to-peer approach to achieve anonymity between a requester and a
provider in peer-to-peer networks with trusted servers called suppernode so
that the provider will not be able to identify the requester and no other peers
can identify the two communicating parties with certainty. This article shows
that the proposed algorithm improved reliability and has more security. This
algorithm, based on onion routing and randomization, protects transferring data
against traffic analysis attack. The ultimate goal of this anonymous
communications algorithm is to allow a requester to communicate with a provider
in such a manner that nobody can determine the requester's identity and the
content of transferred data.

game-theoretical algorithms are time and game complexity. In this study, we
have offered an elegant method to deal with high complexity of game theoretic
multi-objective clustering methods in large-sized data sets. Here, we have
developed a method which selects a subset of strategies from strategies profile
for each player. In this case, the size of payoff matrices reduces
significantly which has a remarkable impact on time complexity. Therefore,
practical problems with more data are tractable with less computational
complexity. Although strategies set may grow with increasing the number of data
points, the presented model of strategy selection reduces the strategy space,
considerably, where clusters are subdivided into several sub-clusters in each
local game. The remarkable results demonstrate the efficiency of the presented
approach in reducing computational complexity of the problem of concern.

on the Foundations of Coordination Languages and Self-Adaptation. FOCLASA 2012
was held in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, on September 8, 2012 as a satellite event
of CONCUR 2012, the 23rd International Conference on Concurrency Theory. The
workshop provides a venue where researchers and practitioners could meet,
exchange ideas, identify common problems, determine some of the key and
fundamental issues related to coordination languages and self adaptation, and
explore together and disseminate solutions. Indeed, a number of hot research
topics are currently sharing the common problem of combining concurrent,
distributed, mobile and heterogeneous components, trying to harness the
intrinsic complexity of the resulting systems. Computation nowadays is becoming
inherently concurrent, either because of characteristics of the hardware (with
multicore processors becoming omnipresent) or due to the ubiquitous presence of
distributed systems (incarnated in the Internet). Computational systems are
therefore typically distributed, concurrent, mobile, and often involve
composition of heterogeneous components. To specify and reason about such
systems and go beyond the functional correctness proofs, e.g., by supporting
reusability and improving maintainability, approaches such as coordination
languages and self adaptation are recognised as fundamental.
  This year, we received 13 submissions involving 35 authors from 10 different
countries. Papers underwent a rigorous review process, and all accepted papers
received 3 review reports. After the review process, the international Program
Committee of FOCLASA 2012 decided to select 8 papers for presentation during
the workshop and inclusion in these proceedings. These papers tackle different
issues that are currently central to our community, self-adaptation and
coordination, processes and coordination, and type systems. The workshop
features an invited talk by Sebastian Uchitel from Imperial College London
(UK).

  pfrimer.physics@gmail.com",,,,"physics.gen-ph quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  What is the nature of reality? How should be an answer to this question? At
this level, we are so deep that all our concepts are obscure. Quantum theory
(QT) is at this level. The quest for interpreting it fails because the clarity
of our actual fundamental concepts in ordinary language cannot match the
precision of the theory's mathematical formalism. The interpretation of quantum
mechanics should define and bring clarity to fundamental concepts; not simply
rely over them. Quantum theory requires a new worldview, the one that will make
it understandable. We discuss on the formulation and interpretation of closed,
and final theories, in other words, completely axiomatic theories that define
their own conceptual framework, and closed theories that cannot be made
simpler. We claim that everything we can properly say about a theory follows
from its interpretation, and that interpreting is saying the meaning of each of
its mathematical statements. We argue that quantum mechanics is a closed
theory; and, therefore, that part of it is part of the final or fundamental
theory of physics (FTP). We propose a new entirely axiomatic formulation of
part of quantum theory (including all its mathematical framework) in which new
powerful and useful elements are added to the existing formalism. Our
interpretation is straightforward: it allows us reading or saying the meaning
of each of the theory's axiom, theorem or element. We state that the proposed
theory is the FTP. Its interpretation may dissolve most of the existing
paradoxes around QT. The principle of excluded middle is not valid in general.
Both epistemic and ontic elements are present in the theory since it is a
theory of knowledge and truth. This and other fundamental concepts are defined
by the theory, which can represent both reality and our knowledge about it.
Aesthetics is one of its key features.
