at high bias, little to nothing is known. To this end we investigated bi-layer
graphene constrictions with closed edges (seamless) at high bias using in situ
atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. We directly observe a
highly localized anomalously large lattice expansion inside the constriction.
Both the current density and lattice expansion increase as the bi-layer
graphene constriction narrows. As the constriction width decreases below 10 nm,
shortly before failure, the current density rises to 4 \cdot 109 A cm-2 and the
constriction exhibits a lattice expansion with a uniaxial component showing an
expansion approaching 5 % and an isotropic component showing an expansion
exceeding 1 %. The origin of the lattice expansion is hard to fully ascribe to
thermal expansion. Impact ionization is a process in which charge carriers
transfer from bonding states to antibonding states thus weakening bonds. The
altered character of C-C bonds by impact ionization could explain the
anomalously large lattice expansion we observe in seamless bi-layer graphene
constrictions. Moreover, impact ionization might also contribute to the
observed anisotropy in the lattice expansion, although strain is probably the
predominant factor.

also for particles in non-radial motion, in which the Poynting-Robertson

""levitation"" on the Eddington sphere (above the stellar surface) is a state of
stable equilibrium, and discuss its implications for Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion

of a compact star for actual accretion is typically less than the geometrical
cross-section (pi Rsquared), direct infall onto the stellar surface only being
possible for relativistic particles, with the required minimum particle
velocity at infinity typically ~1/2 the speed of light. We further show that

for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and their upgrade for the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Originally commissioned in Fall 1999
on the 2.5-m aperture Sloan Telescope at Apache Point Observatory, the
spectrographs produced more than 1.5 million spectra for the SDSS and SDSS-II
surveys, enabling a wide variety of Galactic and extra-galactic science
including the first observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in 2005. The
spectrographs were upgraded in 2009 and are currently in use for BOSS, the
flagship survey of the third-generation SDSS-III project. BOSS will measure
redshifts of 1.35 million massive galaxies to redshift 0.7 and Lyman-alpha
absorption of 160,000 high redshift quasars over 10,000 square degrees of sky,
making percent level measurements of the absolute cosmic distance scale of the
Universe and placing tight constraints on the equation of state of dark energy.
  The twin multi-object fiber spectrographs utilize a simple optical layout
with reflective collimators, gratings, all-refractive cameras, and
state-of-the-art CCD detectors to produce hundreds of spectra simultaneously in
two channels over a bandpass covering the near ultraviolet to the near
infrared, with a resolving power R = \lambda/FWHM ~ 2000. Building on proven
heritage, the spectrographs were upgraded for BOSS with volume-phase
holographic gratings and modern CCD detectors, improving the peak throughput by
nearly a factor of two, extending the bandpass to cover 360 < \lambda < 1000
nm, and increasing the number of fibers from 640 to 1000 per exposure. In this
paper we describe the original SDSS spectrograph design and the upgrades
implemented for BOSS, and document the predicted and measured performances.

Remote inter-layer hopping terms and external potential difference $\Delta_{B}$

between the degenerate zero-energy triplet LL orbitals. Assuming that the spin
and valley degrees of freedom are frozen, we study the phase diagram of this

Coulomb interactions within the Hartree-Fock approximation at integer filling
factors. Above a critical value $\Delta_{LL}^{c}$ of the external potential
difference i,e, for $|\Delta_{LL}| >\Delta_{LL}^{c}$, the ground state is a
uniform quantum Hall state where the electrons occupy the lowest unoccupied LL
orbital index. For $|\Delta_{LL}| <\Delta_{LL}^{c}$ (which corresponds to large
positive or negative values of $\Delta_{B}$) the uniform QH state is unstable
to the formation of a crystal state at integer filling factors. This phase
transition should be characterized by a Hall plateau transition as a function
of $\Delta_{LL}$ at a fixed filling factor. We also study the properties of
this crystal state and discuss its experimental detection.

that the last gene flow from Neandertals (or their relatives) into Europeans
likely occurred 37,000-86,000 years before the present (BP), and most likely

to probe the structure of the white matter non-invasively. Despite its
potential, the intrinsic long scan times of these sequences have hampered their
use in clinical practice. For this reason, a large variety of methods have been
recently proposed to shorten the acquisition times. Among them, spherical
deconvolution approaches have gained a lot of interest for their ability to
reliably recover the intra-voxel fiber configuration with a relatively small
number of data samples. To overcome the intrinsic instabilities of
deconvolution, these methods use regularization schemes generally based on the
assumption that the fiber orientation distribution (FOD) to be recovered in
each voxel is sparse. The well known Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD)
approach resorts to Tikhonov regularization, based on an l2-norm prior, which
promotes a weak version of sparsity. Also, in the last few years compressed
sensing has been advocated to further accelerate the acquisitions and l1-norm
minimization is generally employed as a means to promote sparsity in the
recovered FODs. In this paper, we provide evidence that the use of an l1-norm
prior to regularize this class of problems is somewhat inconsistent with the
fact that the fiber compartments all sum up to unity. To overcome this l1
inconsistency while simultaneously exploiting sparsity more optimally than
through an l2 prior, we reformulate the reconstruction problem as a constrained
formulation between a data term and and a sparsity prior consisting in an
explicit bound on the l0 norm of the FOD, i.e. on the number of fibers. The
method has been tested both on synthetic and real data. Experimental results
show that the proposed l0 formulation significantly reduces modeling errors
compared to the state-of-the-art l2 and l1 regularization approaches.

indirectly. The field influences not the dynamics of the sheath itself but
rather its operating conditions, i.e., the ion flux through it and voltage drop
across it. To support this interpretation, the particle-in-cell results are
compared with the outcome of the recently proposed ensemble-in-spacetime

the electromagnetic- and weak-charge radii of a variety of nuclei. Special
emphasis is placed on the experimentally accessible electroweak skin, defined
as the difference between weak-charge and electromagnetic-charge radii.
Methods: Two accurately calibrated relativistic mean field models are used to
compute proton, neutron, charge, and weak-charge radii of a variety of nuclei.
Results: We find that spin-orbit contributions to the electroweak skin of light

substantial increase in the size of the electroweak skin relative to the

are presented as a function of both collision centrality and transverse

Au+Au collisions (R_CP) and for various centrality selections in Au+Au relative
to scaled p+p cross sections obtained from other measurements (R_AA). The
observed suppression patterns at 39 and 62.4 GeV are quite similar to those
previously measured at 200 GeV. This similar suppression presents a challenge
to theoretical models that contain various competing mechanisms with different
energy dependencies, some of which cause suppression and others enhancement.

many factors underlying the genetic basis of traits and the predisposition to
complex disease, but much is left to discover. A common thread to most genetic
investigations is familial relationships. Close relatives can be identified
from family records, and more distant relatives can be inferred from large
panels of genetic markers. Unfortunately these empirical estimates can be
noisy, especially regarding distant relatives. We propose a new method for
denoising genetically - inferred relationship matrices by exploiting the
underlying structure due to hierarchical groupings of correlated individuals.
The approach, which we call Treelet Covariance Smoothing, employs a multiscale
decomposition of covariance matrices to improve estimates of pairwise
relationships. On both simulated and real data, we show that smoothing leads to
better estimates of the relatedness amongst distantly related individuals. We
illustrate our method with a large genome-wide association study and estimate
the ""heritability"" of body mass index quite accurately. Traditionally
heritability, defined as the fraction of the total trait variance attributable
to additive genetic effects, is estimated from samples of closely related
individuals using random effects models. We show that by using smoothed
relationship matrices we can estimate heritability using population-based
samples. Finally, while our methods have been developed for refining genetic
relationship matrices and improving estimates of heritability, they have much
broader potential application in statistics. Most notably, for
error-in-variables random effects models and settings that require
regularization of matrices with block or hierarchical structure.

collisions at sqrt(s_NN)=200 GeV. The new data offer a fourfold increase in
recorded luminosity, providing higher precision and a larger reach in
transverse momentum, p_T, to 20 GeV/c. The production ratio of eta/pi^0 is
0.46+/-0.01(stat)+/-0.05(syst), constant with p_T and collision centrality. The
observed ratio is consistent with earlier measurements, as well as with the p+p
and d+Au values. The production of pi^0 is suppressed by a factor of 5, as in
earlier findings. However, with the improved statistical precision a small but
significant rise of the nuclear modification factor, R_AA, vs p_T, with a slope
of 0.0106+/-^(0.0034)_(0.0029)[GeV/c]^-1, is discernible in central collisions.
A phenomenological extraction of the average fractional parton energy loss
shows a decrease with increasing p_T. To study the path length dependence of
suppression, the pi^0 yield was measured at different angles with respect to
the event plane; a strong azimuthal dependence of the pi^0 R_AA is observed.
The data are compared to theoretical models of parton energy loss as a function
of the path length, L, in the medium. Models based on pQCD are insufficient to
describe the data, while a hybrid model utilizing pQCD for the hard
interactions and AdS/CFT for the soft interactions is consistent with the data.

utilized. Our findings show that the experimentally observed shape of the Fermi
surface is best described by the checkerboard AFM spin pattern. To explore the
underlying pairing mechanism, we study the evolution of the non-magnetic to the
AFM-ordered structures under constrained magnetization. We estimate the
strength of electronic coupling to magnetic excitations involving an increase
in local moment and, separately, a partial moment transfer from one Fe atom to
another. We also show that the charge doping in the FeSe can lead to an
increase in the density of states at the Fermi level and possibly produce
higher superconducting transition temperatures.

spectra of CTTSs, is excited by Lyman alpha photons, providing an indirect
measure of the Lyman alpha flux incident upon the warm disk surface. We use
observed H2 progression fluxes to reconstruct the CTTS Lyman alpha profiles.
The Lyman alpha flux correlates with total measured FUV flux, in agreement with
an accretion-related source of FUV emission. With a geometry-independent

and negligible contamination. The sky coverage of the survey goes from the

Here we describe the XRT data processing, the statistical calibration of the

are detected in the Swift-XRT soft (0.5-2 keV) band. A size parameter defined
as the half power radius (HPR) measured inside a box of 45x45 arcsec, is
assigned to each source. We select extended sources by applying a threshold on
the Half Power Radius and we calibrate its dependence on the measured net
counts and on the image background with extensive simulations in order to
identify all the sources with ~99% probability of being extended. We compute
the logN-logS of our sample, finding very good agreement with previous deep
cluster surveys. A cross correlation with published X-ray catalogs shows that
only 9 sources were already detected, none of them as extended. Therefore, ~90%
of our sources are new X-ray detections. We also cross correlated our sources
with optical catalogs, finding 20 previously identified clusters. Overall,
about ~65% of our sources are new detections. The XRT follow-up observation of
GRBs is providing an excellent serendipitous survey for groups and clusters of
galaxies, mainly thanks to the low background of XRT and its constant angular
resolution across the field of view. About 33% of the sample has spectroscopic

carefully analyze the 136 Keck radial velocities spanning 8 years by first
applying a periodogram analysis to search for nearly circular orbits. We find
no significant periodic Doppler signals with amplitudes above $\sim$2 \ms{},
setting firm upper limits on the minimum mass (\msini) of any planets with
orbital periods from 0.1 to 1000 days. Using a Monte Carlo analysis for
circular orbits, we determine that planetary companions to Barnard's Star with
masses above 2 \mearth{} and periods below 10 days would have been detected.
Planets with periods up to 2 years and masses above 10 \mearth{} (0.03 \mjup)
are also ruled out. A similar analysis allowing for eccentric orbits yields
comparable mass limits. The habitable zone of Barnard's Star appears to be
devoid of roughly Earth-mass planets or larger, save for face-on orbits.

The radial velocity of Barnard's Star increases with time at $4.515\pm0.002$

updated and calculated directly from the flow structure, strongly coupling the
magnetic effects with the circulation pattern. We model the hot Jupiters HD
189733b (Teq \approx 1200 K) and HD 209458b (Teq \approx 1500 K) and test
planetary magnetic field strengths from 0 to 30 G. We find that even at B = 3 G
the atmospheric structure and circulation of HD 209458b are strongly influenced
by magnetic effects, while the cooler HD 189733b remains largely unaffected,
even in the case of B = 30 G and super-solar metallicities. Our models of HD
209458b indicate that magnetic effects can substantially slow down atmospheric
winds, change circulation and temperature patterns, and alter observable
properties. These models establish that longitudinal and latitudinal hot spot
offsets, day-night flux contrasts, and planetary radius inflation are
interrelated diagnostics of the magnetic induction process occurring in the
atmospheres of hot Jupiters and other similarly forced exoplanets. Most of the
ohmic heating occurs high in the atmosphere and on the day side of the planet,
while the heating at depth is strongly dependent on the internal heat flux
assumed for the planet, with more heating when the deep atmosphere is hot. We
compare the ohmic power at depth in our models, and estimates of the ohmic
dissipation in the bulk interior (from general scaling laws), to evolutionary
models that constrain the amount of heating necessary to explain the inflated
radius of HD 209458b. Our results suggest that deep ohmic heating can
successfully inflate the radius of HD 209458b for planetary magnetic field
strengths of B \geq 3 - 10 G.

potential fates as their host stars move off the main sequence and grow to
subgiants and giants. Stellar mass loss tends to make orbits expand, and tidal
torques tend to make orbits shrink, sometimes to the point that a companion is
directly engulfed by its primary. Furthermore, once engulfed, the ensuing
common envelope (CE) phase can result in the companion becoming fully
incorporated in the primary's envelope; or, if the companion is massive enough,
it can transfer enough energy to eject the envelope and remain parked in a
tight orbit around the white dwarf core. Therefore, ordinary binary evolution
ought to lead to two predominant populations of planets around white dwarfs:
those that have been through a CE phase and are in short-period orbits, and
those that have entirely avoided the CE and are in long-period orbits.

hypotheses are often not known in advance, and decision rules have to be
learned via supervised learning. A specific such algorithm is Fisher
discriminant analysis (FDA), the classification accuracy of which has been
previously studied in the context of wireless sensor networks. Previous work,
however, does not take into account the communication protocol or battery
lifetime of the sensor networks; in this paper we extend the existing studies
by proposing a model that captures the relationship between battery lifetime
and classification accuracy. In order to do so we combine the FDA with a model
that captures the dynamics of the Carrier-Sense Multiple-Access (CSMA)
algorithm, the random-access algorithm used to regulate communications in
sensor networks. This allows us to study the interaction between the
classification accuracy, battery lifetime and effort put towards learning, as
well as the impact of the back-off rates of CSMA on the accuracy. We
characterize the tradeoff between the length of the training stage and
accuracy, and show that accuracy is non-monotone in the back-off rate due to
changes in the training sample size and overfitting.

well as ""differential"" and (quantum) A-polynomial structures. We pay a special
attention to identity between the A-polynomial equations for knots and Baxter
equations for quantum relativistic integrable systems, related through
Seiberg-Witten theory to 5d super-Yang-Mills models and through the AGT

emerging a 3d-5d generalization of the AGT relation. The shape of the Baxter

knots parameterize particular points of the Universal Grassmannian, in this

recently observed by LIGO\cite{2016LRR....19....1A}. To be able to measure
these signals, great care has to be taken to minimize all sources of noise in
the detector. One of the sources of noise is called Newtonian noise. In this
article we present an analysis of the dynamical (time dependent) nature of the
Newtonian noise. In that respect, it is a misnomer to call it Newtonian noise,
the Newtonian theory does not afford any dynamical notion of the gravitational
field. The dynamical aspects of the nature of the Newtonian noise have
heretofore been disregarded as they were considered negligible. However, we
demonstrate that they are indeed not far from the realm of being measurable.
They could be used to validate Einsteinian general relativity or to give
valuable information on the true dynamical nature of gravity. One fundamental
question, for example, is a direct measurement the speed of propagation of
gravitational effects and the verification that it is indeed the same as the
speed of light. We propose a simple laboratory experiment that could affirm or
deny this proposition. We also analyze the possibility of the detection of
large geophysical events, such as earthquakes. We find that large seismic
events seem to be easily observable with the present ensemble of gravitational
wave detectors,. The ensemble of gravitational wave detectors could easily
serve as a system of early warning for otherwise catastrophic seismic events.

f:{0,1}^n -> {0,1,...,k}. Our algorithm runs in time polynomial in n, k^{O(k

The fallacy is that, even after setting gauge to vanish, the form of F(R)

claimed to be an outcome of gauge Noether symmetry. On the contrary, earlier
works proved that any nonlinear form other than F(R) \propto R^3/2 is obscure.
Here, we show that, setting gauge term zero, Noether equations are satisfied
only for n = 2, which again does not satisfy the field equations. Thus, as

variables, determining $k$ random variables which have different probability
distributions from the rest $(n-k)$ random variables. Instead of using separate
measurements of each individual random variable, we propose to use mixed
measurements which are functions of multiple random variables. It is
demonstrated that $O({\displaystyle \frac{k \log(n)}{\min_{P_i, P_j} C(P_i,
P_j)}})$ observations are sufficient for correctly identifying the $k$
anomalous random variables with high probability, where $C(P_i, P_j)$ is the
Chernoff information between two possible distributions $P_i$ and $P_j$ for the
proposed mixed observations. We characterized the Chernoff information
respectively under fixed time-invariant mixed observations, random time-varying
mixed observations, and deterministic time-varying mixed observations; in our
derivations, we introduced the \emph{inner and outer conditional Chernoff
information} for time-varying measurements. It is demonstrated that mixed
observations can strictly improve the error exponent of hypothesis testing,
over separate observations of individual random variables. We also
characterized the optimal mixed observations maximizing the error exponent, and
derived an explicit construction of the optimal mixed observations for the case
of Gaussian random variables. These results imply that mixed observations of
random variables can reduce the number of required samples in hypothesis
testing applications. Compared with compressed sensing problems, this paper
considers random variables which are allowed to dramatically change values in
different measurements.

these issues, one step towards this dilemma has been taken in form of
Pre-congestion notification (PCN) technique. PCN uses a packet marking
technique within a PCN domain over IP networks. It is notified by egress node
that works as guard at entry point of network. Egress node gives feedback to
communicating servers whether rate on the link is exceeded than configured
admissible threshold or within the limit. Based on this feedback, admission
decisions are taken to determine whether to allow/block new coming flows or
terminate already accepted. The actual question is about selection of right
algorithm for PCN domain. In this paper, we investigate the analytical behavior
of some known PCN algorithms. We make slide modifications in originality of PCN
algorithms without disquieting working process in order to employ those within
similar types of scenarios. Our goal is to simulate them either in highly
congested or less congested realistic scenarios. On the basis of simulation
done in ns2, we are able to recommend each PCN algorithm for specific
conditions. Finally, we develop a benchmark that helps researchers and
scientific communities to pick the right algorithm. Furthermore, the benchmark
is designed to achieve specific objectives according to the users' requirements
without congesting the network.

  Cost-Biased Maximum-Likelihood Approach","Improved presentation, Fixed typos",,,,"math.OC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Networked control strategies based on limited information about the plant
model usually results in worse closed-loop performance than optimal centralized
control with full plant model information. Recently, this fact has been
established by utilizing the concept of competitive ratio, which is defined as
the worst case ratio of the cost of a control design with limited model
information to the cost of the optimal control design with full model
information. We show that an adaptive controller, inspired by a controller
proposed by Campi and Kumar, with limited plant model information,
asymptotically achieves the closed-loop performance of the optimal centralized
controller with full model information for almost any plant. Therefore, there
exists, at least, one adaptive control design strategy with limited plant model
information that can achieve a competitive ratio equal to one. The plant model
considered in the paper belongs to a compact set of stochastic linear
time-invariant systems and the closed loop performance measure is the ergodic
mean of a quadratic function of the state and control input. We illustrate the
applicability of the results numerically on a vehicle platooning problem.

the tolerance factor is in fact a more reliable representative of the lattice
deformation induced by doping. The normalization of the phase boundaries using
the tolerance factor corroborates previous theoretical outcomes regarding the
key role of competitive FM and AFM exchanges in determining the phase diagrams
of manganite perovskites. Though, significant differences in the nature and
number of phases at low temperatures and concentrations could not be explained
by just considering the normalization to the tolerance factor. The vertical
phase boundary observed just for Lu-doped EuMnO3, close to 10%Lu, is understood
considering a low temperature Peierls-type spin-phonon coupling, which
stabilizes the AFM4 phase in Lu-doped EuMnO3.

impact of different population sizes on the performance of EAs. However, most
of such studies are based computational experiments, except for a few cases.
The common wisdom so far appears to be that a large population would increase
the population diversity and thus help an EA. Indeed, increasing the population
size has been a commonly used strategy in tuning an EA when it did not perform
as well as expected for a given problem. He and Yao (2002) showed theoretically
that for some problem instance classes, a population can help to reduce the
runtime of an EA from exponential to polynomial time. This paper analyzes the
role of population further in EAs and shows rigorously that large populations
may not always be useful. Conditions, under which large populations can be
harmful, are discussed in this paper. Although the theoretical analysis was
carried out on one multi-modal problem using a specific type of EAs, it has
much wider implications. The analysis has revealed certain problem
characteristics, which can be either the problem considered here or other
problems, that lead to the disadvantages of large population sizes. The
analytical approach developed in this paper can also be applied to analyzing
EAs on other problems.

the presence of a long-lived reverse shock (RS). Although a short-lived RS has
been widely considered, the RS is believed to be long-lived as a consequence of
a stratification expected on the ejecta Lorentz factors. The existence of a
long-lived RS makes the forward shock (FS) dynamics to deviate from a
self-similar Blandford-McKee solution. Employing the ""mechanical model"" that
correctly incorporates the energy conservation, we present an accurate solution
for both the FS and RS dynamics. We conduct a sophisticated calculation of the
afterglow emission. Adopting a Lagrangian description of the blast wave, we
keep track of an adiabatic evolution of numerous shells between the FS and RS.
An evolution of the electron spectrum is also followed individually for every
shell. We then find the FS and RS light curves by integrating over the entire
FS and RS shocked regions, respectively. In particular, we make use of an
analytic expression for observed spectral flux, which we derive here in terms
of an observed frequency and observer time. Exploring a total of 20 different
ejecta stratifications, we explain in detail how a stratified ejecta affects
its blast wave dynamics and afterglow light curves. We show that, while the FS
light curves are not sensitive to the ejecta stratifications, the RS light
curves exhibit much richer features, including steep declines, plateaus, bumps,
re-brightenings, and a variety of temporal decay indices. These distinctive RS
features may be observable if the RS has higher values of the micophysics
parameters than the FS. We discuss possible applications of our results in
understanding the GRB afterglow data.

triple quantum dot system --- for the observation of the SU(3) Kondo effect.
Unlike more familiar SU(2) and SU(4) Kondo effects in quantum dot devices which
lead to unitary linear conductance at low temperatures, the SU(3) Kondo
scenario can be easily identified by the conductance pinned to a characteristic
value of 3/4 of the unitary limit. This is associated with the interesting fact
that the SU(3) Kondo effect does not occur at the particle-hole symmetric
point, where the system is found instead in the valence-fluctuating regime with
the total dot occupancy flipping between 1 and 2, but for gate voltages in the
two Kondo plateaux where the dot occupancy is pinned to an integer value,
either 1 or 2. From the thermodynamic analysis in the Kondo regime we find that
the effective impurity orbital moment, defined through the impurity orbital
susceptibility (chi_imp) multiplied by the temperature, is T\chi_imp=1 at high
temperatures and then it increases to the characteristic value of T\chi_imp=4/3
corresponding to the three-fold degenerate local-moment fixed point where the
impurity entropy is S_imp=ln 3. Then, at much lower temperatures, the system
flows to the non-degenerate strong-coupling fixed point in which the SU(3)
Kondo effect takes place. We also report results about the robustness of the
SU(3) Kondo effect against various perturbations present in real experimental
setups. Finally, we describe possible mechanisms to restore the SU(3) Kondo
physics by properly tuning the on-site dot potentials. We briefly comment on
the spinfull case which has very different behavior and shows Kondo plateaus in
conductance for all integer values of the occupancy, including at the
particle-hole symmetric point.

such models may lack important quantitative characteristics of Internet graphs.
While preferential attachment random graph models were shown to be capable of
reflecting the degree distribution of the webgraph, their ability to reflect
certain aspects of the edge distribution was not yet well studied.
  In this paper, we consider the Buckley--Osthus implementation of preferential
attachment and its ability to model the web host graph in two aspects. One is
the degree distribution that we observe to follow the power law, as often being
the case for real-world graphs. Another one is the two-dimensional edge
distribution, the number of edges between vertices of given degrees. We fit a
single ""initial attractiveness"" parameter $a$ of the model, first with respect
to the degree distribution of the web host graph, and then, absolutely
independently, with respect to the edge distribution. Surprisingly, the values
of $a$ we obtain turn out to be nearly the same. Therefore the same model with
the same value of the parameter $a$ fits very well the two independent and
basic aspects of the web host graph. In addition, we demonstrate that other
models completely lack the asymptotic behavior of the edge distribution of the
web host graph, even when accurately capturing the degree distribution.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for a real graph of

factors achieved by off-path attackers, using only puppets, i.e., sandboxed
malware on victim machines. Specifically, we present off-path variants of the
Opt-ack, Ack-storm and Coremelt DoS attacks, achieving results comparable to
these achieved previously achieved by eavesdropping/MitM attackers and
(unrestricted) malware. In contrast to previous off-path attacks, which
attacked the client (machine) running the malware, our attacks address a very
different goal: large-scale clogging DoS of a third party, or even of backbone
connections.
  Our clogging attacks are based on off-path TCP injections. Indeed, as an
additional contribution, we present improved off-path TCP injection attacks.
Our new attacks significantly relax the requirements cf. to the known attacks;
specifically, our injection attack requires only a Java script in browser
sandbox (not 'restricted malware'), does not depend on specific operating
system properties, and is efficient even when client's port is determined using
recommended algorithm. Our attacks are constructed modularly, allowing reuse of
modules for other scenarios and replacing modules as necessary. We present
specific defenses, however, this work is further proof to the need to base
security on sound foundations, using cryptography to provide security even
against MitM attackers.

spatial coordinates is presented. The model is based on the Fourier space
corresponding to spatial coordinates, as this Fourier space is commutative.
When the group is compact, the real space exhibits lattice characteristics (as
the eigenvalues of space operators are discrete), and the similarity of such a
\emph{lattice} with ordinary lattices is manifested, among other things, in a
phenomenon resembling the famous \emph{fermion doubling} problem. A projection
is introduced to make the dynamical number of spinors equal to that
corresponding to the ordinary space. The actions for free and interacting
spinors (with Fermi-like interactions) are presented. The Feynman rules are
extracted and 1-loop corrections are investigated.

Effect. We build on previous efforts to develop a quantum model that explains
the Guppy Effect in terms of interference. Using a well-studied data set with
16 exemplars that exhibit the Guppy Effect, we developed a 17-dimensional
complex Hilbert space H that models the data and demonstrates the relationship
between overextension and interference. We view the interference effect as, not
a logical fallacy on the conjunction, but a signal that out of the two
constituent concepts, a new concept has emerged.

one has the impression that new technologies develop and conquer the market in
a very easy way. This may be true for some new technologies, for example the
cell phone, but not for others, like the blue-ray. Novelty, usefulness,
advertising, price, and fashion are the driving forces behind the adoption of a
new product. But, what are the key factors that lead to adopt a new technology?
In this paper we propose and investigate a simple model for the adoption of an
innovation which depends mainly on three elements: the appeal of the novelty,
the inertia or resistance to adopt it, and the interaction with other agents.
Social interactions are taken into account in two ways: by imitation and by
differentiation, i.e., some agents will be inclined to adopt an innovation if
many people do the same, but other will act in the opposite direction, trying
to differentiate from the ""herd"". We determine the conditions for a successful
implantation of the new technology, by considering the strength of advertising
and the effect of social interactions. We find a balance between the
advertising and the number of anti-herding agents that may block the adoption
of a new product. We also compare the effect of social interactions, when
agents take into account the behavior of the whole society or just a part of
it. In a nutshell, the present model reproduces qualitatively the available
data on adoption of innovation.

(SOON) sunspot group data during the period of 1874-2011 and determined
variations in the annual numbers (counts) of the small, large and big sunspot
groups (these classifications are made on the basis of the maximum areas of the
sunspot groups). We found that the amplitude of an even-numbered cycle of the
number of large groups is smaller than that of its immediately following
odd-numbered cycle. This is consistent with the well known Gnevyshev and Ohl
rule or G-O rule of solar cycles, generally described by using the Zurich
sunspot number (Rz). During cycles 12-21 the G-O rule holds good for the
variation in the number of small groups also, but it is violated by cycle pair
(22, 23) as in the case of Rz. This behaviour of the variations in the small
groups is largely responsible for the anomalous behaviour of Rz in cycle pair
(22, 23). It is also found that the amplitude of an odd-numbered cycle of the
number of small groups is larger than that of its immediately following
even-numbered cycle. This can be called as `reverse G-O rule'. In the case of
the number of the big groups, both cycle pairs (12, 13) and (22, 23) violated
the G-O rule. In many cycles the positions of the peaks of the small, large,
and big groups are different and considerably differ with respect to the
corresponding positions of the Rz peaks. In the case of cycle 23, the
corresponding cycles of the small and large groups are largely symmetric/less
asymmetric (Waldmeier effect is weak/absent) with their maxima taking place two
years later than that of Rz. The corresponding cycle of the big groups is more
asymmetric (strong Waldmeier effect) with its maximum epoch taking place at the
same time as that of Rz.

discrete model of time, in which the latter comprises a succession of instants
which are identified as collisions with particles called chronons. Proper-time
intervals are discrete; the structure of space-time is given by a radar map and
has an inbuilt indeterminacy, which leads naturally to Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle. If I were writing this paper today I would identify the chronon with
the virtual Higgs boson. Without the latter all particles would be massless and
would follow null paths; there would be no such thing as proper time. Time is
an emergent phenomenon, and the Higgs boson is the agent of that emergence.
