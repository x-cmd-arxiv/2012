low as observed in molecular clouds (MCs), for characteristic values of the
free-fall time divided by the dynamical time, $t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm dyn}$, the
alfv\'{e}nic Mach number, ${\cal M}_{\rm a}$, and the sonic Mach number, ${\cal
M}_{\rm s}$. Using a very large set of deep adaptive-mesh-refinement
simulations, we quantify the dependence of the SFR per free-fall time,
$\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, on the above parameters. Our main results are: i)
$\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ decreases exponentially with increasing $t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm
dyn}$, but is insensitive to changes in ${\cal M}_{\rm s}$, for constant values
of $t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm dyn}$ and ${\cal M}_{\rm a}$. ii) Decreasing values of
${\cal M}_{\rm a}$ (stronger magnetic fields) reduce $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, but
only to a point, beyond which $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ increases with a further
decrease of ${\cal M}_{\rm a}$. iii) For values of ${\cal M}_{\rm a}$
characteristic of star-forming regions, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ varies with ${\cal
M}_{\rm a}$ by less than a factor of two. We propose a simple star-formation
law, based on the empirical fit to the minimum $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, and
depending only on $t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm dyn}$: $\epsilon_{\rm ff} \approx
\epsilon_{\rm wind} \exp(-1.6 \,t_{\rm ff}/t_{\rm dyn})$. Because it only
depends on the mean gas density and rms velocity, this law is straightforward
to implement in simulations and analytical models of galaxy formation and
evolution.

  networks from resting state fMRI data",,,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A great improvement to the insight on brain function that we can get from
fMRI data can come from effective connectivity analysis, in which the flow of
information between even remote brain regions is inferred by the parameters of
a predictive dynamical model. As opposed to biologically inspired models, some
techniques as Granger causality (GC) are purely data-driven and rely on
statistical prediction and temporal precedence. While powerful and widely
applicable, this approach could suffer from two main limitations when applied
to BOLD fMRI data: confounding effect of hemodynamic response function (HRF)
and conditioning to a large number of variables in presence of short time
series. For task-related fMRI, neural population dynamics can be captured by
modeling signal dynamics with explicit exogenous inputs; for resting-state fMRI
on the other hand, the absence of explicit inputs makes this task more
difficult, unless relying on some specific prior physiological hypothesis. In
order to overcome these issues and to allow a more general approach, here we
present a simple and novel blind-deconvolution technique for BOLD-fMRI signal.
Coming to the second limitation, a fully multivariate conditioning with short
and noisy data leads to computational problems due to overfitting. Furthermore,
conceptual issues arise in presence of redundancy. We thus apply partial
conditioning to a limited subset of variables in the framework of information
theory, as recently proposed. Mixing these two improvements we compare the
differences between BOLD and deconvolved BOLD level effective networks and draw
some conclusions.

intrusion prevention mechanism is one of the major and efficient methods

biology. Most protein domain ranking methods rely on the pairwise comparison of
protein domains while neglecting the global manifold structure of the protein
domain database. Recently, graph regularized ranking that exploits the global
structure of the graph defined by the pairwise similarities has been proposed.
However, the existing graph regularized ranking methods are very sensitive to
the choice of the graph model and parameters, and this remains a difficult
problem for most of the protein domain ranking methods.
  Results To tackle this problem, we have developed the Multiple Graph
regularized Ranking algorithm, MultiG- Rank. Instead of using a single graph to
regularize the ranking scores, MultiG-Rank approximates the intrinsic manifold
of protein domain distribution by combining multiple initial graphs for the
regularization. Graph weights are learned with ranking scores jointly and
automatically, by alternately minimizing an ob- jective function in an
iterative algorithm. Experimental results on a subset of the ASTRAL SCOP
protein domain database demonstrate that MultiG-Rank achieves a better ranking
performance than single graph regularized ranking methods and pairwise
similarity based ranking methods.
  Conclusion The problem of graph model and parameter selection in graph
regularized protein domain ranking can be solved effectively by combining

  Spectral Features in Supernova Type Ia Spectra","Submitted to ApJ",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spectra of Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia) show both continuum-like and
absorption-like line features. The pseudo equivalent width (pEW) and Doppler
shift of absorption-line-like features, such as Si II 6150A, Ca II HK 3750A,
and the Ca II IR-triplet 8150A quantities that are often associated with the
optical depth and the velocity of a shell of interacting material, are
important tools for interpreting and classifying the SN Ia spectra. In this
paper, we examine the nature of spectral features in SN Ia spectra using W7
model spectra and a technique that we call ""knock-out"" spectra. We show that
the P-Cyg profiles of Si II 6150A and many other features are largely emission
dominated, rather than absorption dominated, and that the concepts of
""absorption line"" and ""continuum"" are therefore not adequate to describe the
nature of spectral features in SNe Ia. Apparent absorption features, like Si II
6150A, are frequently just coincidental troughs between two (or more)
uncorrelated emission features. In this situation, the pEW measured between
these emission peaks is little related to the true strength of the presumed
absorption feature. Furthermore, using the same knock-out technique, we
demonstrate how spectral features overlap each other at different times after
the explosion. This overlap distorts individual line profiles and affects
measured absorption-line velocities. With synthetic SN Ia ejecta
stratifications that are tuned to match specific observations, the method
presented in this paper can in principle be used to quantify the effects of
specific line opacities on measured line velocity, line strength, and line
blending, and improve the interpretation and informative value of observed SN
Ia spectra.

channel. In particular we consider wireless channels that exhibit sparse
structure in the wideband regime and the impact of the sparsity on the secret
key capacity. We explore this problem in two steps. First, we study key
generation from a state-dependent discrete memoryless multiple source. The
state of source captures the effect of channel sparsity. Secondly, we consider
a wireless channel model that captures channel sparsity and correlation between
the legitimate users' channel and the eavesdropper's channel. Such dependency
can significantly reduce the secret key capacity.
  According to system delay requirements, two performance measures are
considered: (i) ergodic secret key capacity and (ii) outage probability. We
show that in the wideband regime when a white sounding sequence is adopted, a
sparser channel can achieve a higher ergodic secret key rate than a richer
channel can. For outage performance, we show that if the users generate secret
keys at a fraction of the ergodic capacity, the outage probability will decay
exponentially in signal bandwidth. Moreover, a larger exponent is achieved by a
richer channel.

stellar heating, which has implications for the planet's atmospheric dynamical
regime. However, little is known about this dynamical regime, and how it may
influence observations. Therefore, we present a systematic study of hot
Jupiters on highly eccentric orbits using the SPARC/MITgcm, a model which
couples a three-dimensional general circulation model with a plane-parallel,
two-stream, non-grey radiative transfer model. In our study, we vary the
eccentricity and orbit-average stellar flux over a wide range. We demonstrate
that the eccentric hot Jupiter regime is qualitatively similar to that of
planets on circular orbits; the planets possess a superrotating equatorial jet
and exhibit large day-night temperature variations. We show that these
day-night heating variations induce momentum fluxes equatorward to maintain the
superrotating jet throughout its orbit. As the eccentricity and/or stellar flux
is increased, the superrotating jet strengthens and narrows, due to a smaller
Rossby deformation radius. For a select number of model integrations, we
generate full-orbit lightcurves and find that the timing of transit and
secondary eclipse viewed from Earth with respect to periapse and apoapse can
greatly affect what we see in infrared (IR) lightcurves; the peak in IR flux
can lead or lag secondary eclipse depending on the geometry. For those planets
that have large day-night temperature variations and rapid rotation rates, we
find that the lightcurves exhibit ""ringing"" as the planet's hottest region
rotates in and out of view from Earth. These results can be used to explain
future observations of eccentric transiting exoplanets.

one wishes to preprocess a text in order to quickly locate pattern queries
within the text. In the ever evolving world of dynamic and on-line data, there
is also a need for developing solutions to index texts which arrive on-line,
i.e. a character at a time, and still be able to quickly locate said patterns.
In this paper, a new solution for on-line indexing is presented by providing an
on-line suffix tree construction in $O(\log \log n + \log\log |\Sigma|)$
worst-case expected time per character, where $n$ is the size of the string,
and $\Sigma$ is the alphabet. This improves upon all previously known on-line
suffix tree constructions for general alphabets, at the cost of having the run
time in expectation.
  The main idea is to reduce the problem of constructing a suffix tree on-line
to an interesting variant of the order maintenance problem, which may be of
independent interest. In the famous order maintenance problem, one wishes to
maintain a dynamic list $L$ of size $n$ under insertions, deletions, and order
queries. In an order query, one is given two nodes from $L$ and must determine
which node precedes the other in $L$. In the Predecessor search on Dynamic
Subsets of an Ordered Dynamic List problem (POLP) it is also necessary to
maintain dynamic subsets of $L$ such that given some $u\in L$ it will be
possible to quickly locate the predecessor of $u$ in any subset. This paper
provides an efficient data structure capable of solving the POLP with
worst-case expected bounds that match the currently best known bounds for
predecessor search in the RAM model, improving over a solution which may be
implicitly obtained from Dietz [Die89].
  Furthermore, this paper improves or simplifies bounds for several additional
applications, including fully-persistent arrays and the Order-Maintenance
Problem.

from the interference between multiple scattering paths1,2. It was originally
proposed for electrons in a crystal, but later was also observed for light3-5,
microwaves6, ultrasound7,8, and ultracold atoms9-12. Actually, in a crystal,
besides electrons there may exist other quasiparticles such as magnons and
spinons. However the search for Anderson localization of these magnetic
excitations is rare so far. Here we report the first observation of spinon
localization in copper benzoate, an ideal compound of spin-1/2
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, by ultra-low-temperature specific heat and
thermal conductivity measurements. We find that while the spinon specific heat
Cs displays linear temperature dependence down to 50 mK, the spinons thermal
conductivity ks only manifests the linear temperature dependence down to 300
mK. Below 300 mK, ks/T decreases rapidly and vanishes at about 100 mK, which is
a clear evidence for Anderson localization. Our finding opens a new window for
studying such a fundamental phenomenon in condensed matter physics.

delivery delay performance of a number of existing throughput optimal coding
schemes and use the results to design a new dynamic rate adaptation scheme that
achieves improved overall throughput-delay performance.
  Under a baseline rate control scheme, the receivers' delay performance is
examined. Based on their Markov states, the knowledge difference between the
sender and receiver, three distinct methods for packet delivery are identified:
zero state, leader state and coefficient-based delivery. We provide analyses of
each of these and show that, in many cases, zero state delivery alone presents
a tractable approximation of the expected packet delivery behaviour.
Interestingly, while coefficient-based delivery has so far been treated as a
secondary effect in the literature, we find that the choice of coefficients is
extremely important in determining the delay, and a well chosen encoding scheme
can, in fact, contribute a significant improvement to the delivery delay.
  Based on our delivery delay model, we develop a dynamic rate adaptation
scheme which uses performance prediction models to determine the sender
transmission rate. Surprisingly, taking this approach leads us to the simple
conclusion that the sender should regulate its addition rate based on the total
number of undelivered packets stored at the receivers. We show that despite its
simplicity, our proposed dynamic rate adaptation scheme results in noticeably
improved throughput-delay performance over existing schemes in the literature.

analysis of discrete-time stochastic systems driven by a statistically
uncertain random noise. The uncertainty is quantified by the conditional
relative entropy of the actual probability law of the noise with respect to a
nominal product measure corresponding to a white noise sequence. We discuss a
balance equation, dissipation inequality and superadditivity property for the
corresponding conditional relative entropy supply as a function of time. The
problem of minimizing the supply required to drive the system between given
state distributions over a specified time horizon is considered. Such
variational problems, involving entropy and probabilistic boundary conditions,
are known in the literature as Schroedinger bridge problems. In application to
control systems, this minimum required conditional relative entropy supply
characterizes the robustness of the system with respect to an uncertain noise.
We obtain a dynamic programming Bellman equation for the minimum required
conditional relative entropy supply and establish a Markov property of the
worst-case noise with respect to the state of the system. For multivariable
linear systems with a Gaussian white noise sequence as the nominal noise model
and Gaussian initial and terminal state distributions, the minimum required
supply is obtained using an algebraic Riccati equation which admits a
closed-form solution. We propose a computable robustness index for such systems
in the framework of an entropy theoretic formulation of uncertainty and provide
an example to illustrate this approach.

more cleanly defined than the factor previously used. General enabling theory
is given that applies to any type of FN plot of data that can be fitted using a
FN-type equation. Practical use is limited to emission situations where slope
correction factors can be reliably predicted. By making a series of
well-defined assumptions and approximations, it is shown how the general
formulas reduce to provide an improved theory of orthodox FN-plot data
analysis. This applies to situations where the circuit current is fully
controlled by the emitter characteristics, and tunneling can be treated as
taking place through a Schottky-Nordheim (SN) barrier. For orthodox emission,
good working formulas make numerical evaluation of the slope correction factor
and the new intercept correction factor quick and straightforward. A numerical
illustration, using simulated emission data, shows how to use this improved
approach to derive values for parameters in the full FN-type equation for the
SN barrier. Good self-consistency is demonstrated. The general enabling
formulas also pave the way for research aimed at developing analogous
data-analysis procedures for non-orthodox emission situations.

etc. Recently, bag-of-features method has shown its power in this field,
treating each ROI as a set of local features. In this paper, we investigate
using the bag-of-features strategy to classify the tissue types in medical
imaging applications. Two important issues are considered here: the visual
vocabulary learning and weighting. Although there are already plenty of
algorithms to deal with them, all of them treat them independently, namely, the
vocabulary learned first and then the histogram weighted. Inspired by
Auto-Context who learns the features and classifier jointly, we try to develop
a novel algorithm that learns the vocabulary and weights jointly. The new
algorithm, called Joint-ViVo, works in an iterative way. In each iteration, we
first learn the weights for each visual word by maximizing the margin of ROI
triplets, and then select the most discriminate visual words based on the
learned weights for the next iteration. We test our algorithm on three tissue
classification tasks: identifying brain tissue type in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), classifying lung tissue in HRCT images, and classifying breast
tissue density in mammograms. The results show that Joint-ViVo can perform
effectively for classifying tissues.

subexcedant functions) were recently generalized by Savage and Schuster, to
arbitrary sequences $\s$ of positive integers, which they called $\s$-inversion
sequences.
  Our object of study is the generating polynomial of the {\em ascent}
statistic over the set of $\s$-inversion sequences of length $n$. Since this
ascent statistic over inversion sequences is equidistributed with the descent
statistic over permutations we call this generalized polynomial the
\emph{$\s$-Eulerian polynomial}. The main result of this paper is that, for any
sequence $\s$ of positive integers, the $\s$-Eulerian polynomial has only real
roots.
  This result is first shown to generalize many existing results about the
real-rootedness of various Eulerian polynomials. We then show that it can be
used to settle a conjecture of Brenti, that Eulerian polynomials for all finite
Coxeter groups have only real roots. It is then extended to several
$q$-analogs. We also show that the MacMahon--Carlitz $q$-Eulerian polynomial
has only real roots whenever $q$ is a positive real number confirming a
conjecture of Chow and Gessel. The same holds true for the
$(\des,\finv)$-generating polynomials and also for the
$(\des,\fmaj)$-generating polynomials for the hyperoctahedral group and the
wreath product groups, confirming further conjectures of Chow and Gessel, and

pnictides is still under debate, it is widely believed that magnetic
interactions or fluctuations play an important role in triggering Cooper
pairing. Because of the relevance of magnetism to pairing, the question of
whether long range spin magnetic order can coexist with superconductivity
microscopically has attracted strong interests. The available experimental
methods used to answer this question are either bulk probes or local ones
without control of probing position, thus the answers range from mutual
exclusion to homogeneous coexistence. To definitively answer this question,
here we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate the local electronic
structure of an underdoped NaFe1-xCoxAs near the spin density wave (SDW) and
superconducting (SC) phase boundary. Spatially resolved spectroscopy directly
reveal both the SDW and SC gap features at the same atomic location, providing
compelling evidence for the microscopic coexistence of the two phases. The
strengths of the SDW and SC features are shown to anti correlate with each
other, indicating the competition of the two orders. The microscopic
coexistence clearly indicates that Cooper pairing occurs when portions of the
Fermi surface (FS) are already gapped by the SDW order. The regime TC < T <
TSDW thus show a strong resemblance to the pseudogap phase of the cuprates
where growing experimental evidences suggest a FS reconstruction due to certain
density wave order. In this phase of the pnictides, the residual FS has a

synthesized by NaAs flux method and its physical properties were investigated
by magnetization, transport and specific heat measurements. In contrast to the
previously reported CaBe$_2$Ge$_2$-type CeNi$_2$As$_2$, the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$-type
CeNi$_2$As$_2$ is a highly anisotropic uniaxial antiferromagnet with the
transition temperature $T_N$=4.8 K. A field induced spin flop transition was
seen below $T_N$ when the applied $\textbf{B}$ is parallel to the
$\textbf{c}$-axis, the magnetic easy axis, together with a huge frustration
parameter $f=\theta_W/T_N$. A pronounced Schottky-like anomaly in specific heat
was also found around 160 K, which could be attributed to the crystalline
electric field effect with the excitation energies being fitted to
$\Delta_1=$325 K and $\Delta_2=$520 K, respectively. Moreover, the in-plane
resistivity anisotropy and low temperature X-ray diffractions suggest that this
compound is a rare example exhibiting a possible structure distortion induced
by the $4f$-electron magnetic frustration.

  Factorization","This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to the terrible

several areas like pattern recognition and information retrieval methods. It
factorizes a matrix into a product of 2 low-rank non-negative matrices that
will define parts-based, and linear representation of nonnegative data.
Recently, Graph regularized NMF (GrNMF) is proposed to find a compact
representation,which uncovers the hidden semantics and simultaneously respects
the intrinsic geometric structure. In GNMF, an affinity graph is constructed
from the original data space to encode the geometrical information. In this
paper, we propose a novel idea which engages a Multiple Kernel Learning
approach into refining the graph structure that reflects the factorization of
the matrix and the new data space. The GrNMF is improved by utilizing the graph
refined by the kernel learning, and then a novel kernel learning method is
introduced under the GrNMF framework. Our approach shows encouraging results of
the proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art clustering
algorithms like NMF, GrNMF, SVD etc.

clusters or associations. Star clusters formed in disks are disrupted due to
the tidal stripping and the evolution of star clusters themselves, and as a
results new stars are supplied to the galactic disks. We performed $N$-body
simulations of star clusters in galactic disks, in which both star clusters and
galactic disks are modeled as $N$-body (""live"") systems, and as a consequence
the disks form transient and recurrent spiral arms. In such non-steady spiral
arms, star clusters migrate radially due to the interaction with spiral arms.
We found that the migration timescale is a few hundreds Myr and that the
angular momentum changes of star clusters are at most $\sim 50$% in 1 Gyr.
Radial migration of star clusters to the inner region of galaxies results in a
fast disruption of the star clusters because of a stronger tidal field in the
inner region of the galaxy. This effect is not negligible for the disruption
timescale of star clusters in galactic disks. Stars stripped from clusters form
tidal tails which spread over 1--2 kpc. While the spatial distribution of tidal
tails change in a complicated way due to the non-steady spiral arms, the
velocity distribution conserve well even if the tidal tails are located at a
few kpc from their parent clusters. Tidal tails of clusters in galactic disks
might be detected using velocity plots.

transport gauge in the hybrid Wannier representation we establish the bulk and
edge states correspondence in the Chern insulator. The same correspondence can
also be established in two dimensional(2D) topological insulator(TI). So we can
consider 2D TI as two time reversal(TR) related CIs put together. The quantum
spin Hall effect(QSHE) can be viewed as two TR related Chern pumps pumping
electrons to opposite directions. Compared with the Z2 spin pump, the two Chern
pumps explanation of QSHE is inherently 2D and predict that the QSHE can be
detected in isolated device, thus make the QSHE directly measurable.

The Einstein's field equations have been solved by considering time dependent
deceleration parameter (DP) which renders the scale factor $a =
(t^{n}e^{kt})^{\frac{1}{m}}$ where $m$, $n$ and $k$ are positive constants. The
cosmological term $(\Lambda(t))$ is found to be positive and a decreasing
function of time which supports the result obtained from supernovae Ia
observations. The geometrical and kinematical features of the model are
