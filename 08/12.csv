product between a 3-brane and the Hamilton cigar soliton space, the
string-cigar braneworld. This transverse manifold is a well-known steady
solution of the Ricci flow equation that describes the evolution of a manifold.
The resulting bulk is an interior and exterior metric for a thick string. This
is a physical and feasible scenario since the source satisfies the dominant
energy condition. It is possible to realize the geometric flow as a result of
variations of the matter content of the brane, actually, as its tensions.
Furthermore, the Ricci flow defines a family of string-like branes and we
studied the effects that the evolution of the transverse space has on the
geometric and physical quantities. The geometric flow makes the cosmological
constant and the relationship between the Planck masses evolves. The
gravitational massless mode remains trapped to the brane and the width of the
mode depends on the evolution parameter. For the Kaluza-Klein modes, the
asymptotic spectrum of mass is the same as for the thin string-like brane and
the analogue Schroedinger potential also changes according to the flow.

two-particle S-matrix satisfying the usual requirements (unitarity, Yang-Baxter

relatively wedge-local quantum fields is constructed which determines the field

results in improving SIMD efficiency and makes sharing fetch and decode

affects divergence, synchronization overhead and the efficiency of memory
access coalescing. Small warps reduce the performance penalty associated with
branch and memory divergence at the expense of a reduction in memory
coalescing. Large warps enhance memory coalescing significantly but also
increase branch and memory divergence. Dynamic workload behavior, including
branch/memory divergence and coalescing, is an important factor in determining
the warp size returning best performance. Optimal warp size can vary from one
workload to another or from one program phase to the next. Based on this
observation, we propose Dynamic Warp Resizing (DWR). DWR takes innovative
microarchitectural steps to adjust warp size during runtime and according to
program characteristics. DWR outperforms static warp size decisions, up to 1.7X

a viable method for detecting stealth aircraft, UAVs, cruise, and ballistic

to use the time variation in the gravitational fields to compute the mass,
position, and velocity of one or more moving objects. The approach is
essentially a gravity-based form of triangulation. Based on order-of-magnitude
calculations, we estimate that under realistic scenarios, this approach will be
feasible if it is possible to design gravimetric devices that are four to five
order of magnitude more sensitive than current devices. To achieve such a level
of sensitivity, we suggest designing detectors that exploit a

of this work is to investigate both theoretically and experimentally the impact
of the MC statistical fluctuation on the gamma-index test when the fluctuation
exists in the reference, the evaluation, or both dose distributions. To the
first order approximation, we theoretically demonstrated in a simplified model
that the statistical fluctuation tends to overestimate gamma-index values when
existing in the reference dose distribution and underestimate gamma-index
values when existing in the evaluation dose distribution given the original
gamma-index is relatively large for the statistical fluctuation. Our numerical
experiments using clinical photon radiation therapy cases have shown that 1)
when performing a gamma-index test between an MC reference dose and a non-MC
evaluation dose, the average gamma-index is overestimated and the passing rate
decreases with the increase of the noise level in the reference dose; 2) when
performing a gamma-index test between a non-MC reference dose and an MC
evaluation dose, the average gamma-index is underestimated when they are within
the clinically relevant range and the passing rate increases with the increase
of the noise level in the evaluation dose; 3) when performing a gamma-index
test between an MC reference dose and an MC evaluation dose, the passing rate
is overestimated due to the noise in the evaluation dose and underestimated due
to the noise in the reference dose. We conclude that the gamma-index test

lambda calculus with letrec, and the infinite lambda terms they express. As
there are easy examples of lambda-terms that, intuitively, are not unfoldings
of terms in lambda-letrec, we consider the question: How can those infinite
lambda terms be characterised that are lamda-letrec-expressible in the sense
that they can be obtained as infinite unfoldings of terms in lambda-letrec?
  For 'observing' infinite lambda-terms through repeated 'experiments' carried
out at the head of the term we introduce two rewrite systems (with rewrite
relations) -reg-> and -reg+-> that decompose the term, and produce 'generated
subterms' in two notions. Thereby the sort of the step can be observed as well
as its target, a generated subterm. In both systems there are four sorts of
decomposition steps: -lambda-> steps (decomposing a lambda-abstraction), -@0>
and -@1> steps (decomposing an application into its function and argument), and
respectively, -del-> steps (delimiting the scope of an abstraction, for
-reg->), and -S-> (delimiting of scopes, for -reg+->). These steps take place
on infinite lambda-terms furnished with a leading prefix of abstractions for
gathering previously encountered lambda-abstractions and keeping the generated
subterms closed. We call an infinite lambda-term 'regular'/'strongly regular'
if its set of -reg-> -reachable / -reg-> -reachable generated subterms is
finite. Furthermore, we analyse the binding structure of lambda-terms with the
concept of 'binding-capturing chain'.
  Using these concepts, we answer the question above by providing two

  Framework for Throughput and Decoding Delay Performance","39 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the tension between throughput and decoding delay
performance of two widely-used network coding schemes: random linear network
coding (RLNC) and instantly decodable network coding (IDNC). A single-hop
broadcasting system model is considered that aims to deliver a block of packets
to all receivers in the presence of packet erasures. For a fair and
analytically tractable comparison between the two coding schemes, the
transmission comprises two phases: a systematic transmission phase and a
network coded transmission phase which is further divided into rounds. After
the systematic transmission phase and given the same packet reception state,
three quantitative metrics are proposed and derived in each scheme: 1) the
absolute minimum number of transmissions in the first coded transmission round
(assuming no erasures), 2) probability distribution of extra coded
transmissions in a subsequent round (due to erasures), and 3) average packet
decoding delay. This comparative study enables application-aware adaptive
selection between IDNC and RLNC after systematic transmission phase.
  One contribution of this paper is to provide a deep and systematic
understanding of the IDNC scheme, to propose the notion of packet diversity and
an optimal IDNC encoding scheme for minimizing metric 1. This is generally
NP-hard, but nevertheless required for characterizing and deriving all the
three metrics. Analytical and numerical results show that there is no clear
winner between RLNC and IDNC if one is concerned with both throughput and
decoding delay performance. IDNC is more preferable than RLNC when the number
of receivers is smaller than packet block size, and the case reverses when the
number of receivers is much greater than the packet block size. In the middle
regime, the choice can depend on the application and a specific instance of the
problem.

can be extended to remove the requirement that $2/\beta \in \mathbb Z^+$.
Furthermore, a large deviation formula for the gap probability
$E_\beta(n;(0,x);{\rm ME}_{\beta,N}(\lambda^{a \beta /2} e^{\beta N

use it for deriving the threshold of the protograph codes in a single-input

simulated results, we further discuss the effect of the diversity order on the
performance of the protograph codes. Accordingly, the AR3A code stands out as a
good candidate for wireless communication systems with multiple receive

an energy homogeneous system where a node is not likely to fail due to failure
in connectivity and packet dropping. More recent protocols like SEP and TEEN

comparison are throughput (T), delay (D) and offered load (G). The main goal
for comparison is to show which technique gives highest Throughput and lowest

in the middle of last century, there were feverish dreams that their strong
magnetic moment would afford a wide range of applications. For decades research
was frustrated by poor stoichiometry and the ready reaction of the materials in
ambient conditions, and only recently have these impediments finally been
overcome by advances in thin film fabrication with ultra-high vacuum based
growth technology. Currently, the field of research into the RENs is growing
rapidly, motivated by the materials demands of proposed electronic and
spintronic devices. Both semiconducting and ferromagnetic properties have been
established in some of the RENs which thus attract interest for the potential
to exploit the spin of charge carriers in semiconductor technologies for both
fundamental and applied science. In this review, we take stock of where
progress has occurred within the last decade in both theoretical and
experimental fields, and which has led to the point where a proof-of-concept
spintronic device based on RENs has already been demonstrated. The article is
organized into three major parts. First, we describe the epitaxial growth of
REN thin films and their structural properties, with an emphasis on their
prospective spintronic applications. Then, we conduct a critical review of the
different advanced theoretical calculations utilised to determine both the
electronic structure and the origins of the magnetism in these compounds. The
rest of the review is devoted to the recent experimental results on optical,
electrical and magnetic properties and their relation to current theoretical
descriptions. These results are discussed particularly with regard to the
controversy about the exact nature of the magnetic state and conduction
processes in the RENs.

numerically by an accurate multipole code HYDROMULTIPOLE. Fibers migrate
towards a critical distance from the wall zc, which depends significantly on
the fiber length N and bending stiffness A. Therefore, the calculated values of
zc can be used to sort fibers. Three modes of the dynamics are found, depending
on a shear-to-bending parameter Gamma. In the first mode, stiff fibers deform
only a little and accumulate close to the wall, as the result of a balance
between the tendency to drift away from the channel and the repulsive
hydrodynamic interaction with the wall. This mechanism is confirmed by
simulations in the unbounded Poiseuille flow. In the second mode, flexible
fibers deform significantly and accumulate far from the wall. In both modes,
the tumbling pattern is repeatable. In the third mode, the fibers are even more
curved, and their tumbling is irregular.

progenitors of BH-NS and BH-BH binary systems may have been observed, in the
form of High-Mass X-ray Binaries (HMXBs). In this paper, we continue work
studying these potential progenitors of these important gravitational wave
sources. In the first two papers of the series, we have demonstrated that IC10
X-1 and NGC300 X-1 are direct progenitors of BH-BH systems and that Cyg X-1 may
form, alas with a very low probability, a BH-NS system. Here, we analyze the
Galactic binaries GX 301-2, Vela X-1, XTEJ1855-026, 4U1907+09, Cir X-1 and
extra-galactic LMC X-1, LMC X-3, M33 X-1. In each case, we find that the future
evolution will not allow the formation of a BH-NS nor a BH-BH system. Most of
these binaries will soon merge in the common envelope phase, with a compact
object sinking into a helium-rich core of a stellar companion. This
""helium-merger"" may be a progenitor for long duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
Based on the observed HMXB population, the rate of helium-mergers may make up a
sizable fraction of long-duration GRBs. Due to this high number of potential

  functions: theory and applications","10 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Polyhedral control Lyapunov functions (PCLFs) are exploited in finite-horizon
linear model predictive control formulations in order to guarantee the maximal
domain of attraction (DoA), in contrast to traditional formulations based on
quadratic control Lyapunov functions. In particular, the terminal region is
chosen as the largest DoA, namely the entire controllable set, which is
parametrized by a level set of a suitable PCLF. Closed-loop stability of the
origin is guaranteed either by using an ""inflated"" PCLF as terminal cost or by
adding a contraction constraint for the PCLF evaluated at the current state.
Two variants of the formulation based on the inflated PCLF terminal cost are
also presented. In all proposed formulations, the guaranteed DoA is always the
entire controllable set, independently of the chosen finite horizon.
Closed-loop inherent robustness with respect to arbitrary, sufficiently small
perturbations is also established. Moreover, all proposed schemes can be
formulated as Quadratic Programming problems. Numerical examples show the main
benefits and achievements of the proposed formulations.

automorphism group, and $A(G)$ the Albanese variety of $G$. We determine the
isogeny class of $A(G)$ in terms of the geometry of $X$. In characteristic 0,
we show that the dimension of $A(G)$ is the rank of every maximal trivial
direct summand of the tangent sheaf of $X$. Also, we obtain an optimal bound
for the dimension of the largest anti-affine closed subgroup of $G$ (which is
the smallest closed subgroup that maps onto $A(G)$).

with the CHARA Array. This sample is enhanced by literature radii measurements
to form a data set of 33 K-M dwarfs with diameters measured to better than 5%.
For all 33 stars, we compute absolute luminosities, linear radii, and effective
temperatures (Teff). We develop empirical relations for \simK0 to M4 main-
sequence stars between the stellar Teff, radius, and luminosity to broad-band
color indices and metallicity. These relations are valid for metallicities
between [Fe/H] = -0.5 and +0.1 dex, and are accurate to ~2%, ~5%, and ~4% for
Teff, radius, and luminosity, respectively. Our results show that it is
necessary to use metallicity dependent transformations to convert colors into
stellar Teffs, radii, and luminosities. We find no sensitivity to metallicity
on relations between global stellar properties, e.g., Teff-radius and
Teff-luminosity. Robust examinations of single star Teffs and radii compared to
evolutionary model predictions on the luminosity-Teff and luminosity-radius
planes reveals that models overestimate the Teffs of stars with Teff < 5000 K
by ~3%, and underestimate the radii of stars with radii < 0.7 R\odot by ~5%.
These conclusions additionally suggest that the models overestimate the effects
that the stellar metallicity may have on the astrophysical properties of an
object. By comparing the interferometrically measured radii for single stars to
those of eclipsing binaries, we find that single and binary star radii are
consistent. However, the literature Teffs for binary stars are systematically
lower compared to Teffs of single stars by ~ 200 to 300 K. Lastly, we present a
empirically determined HR diagram for a total of 74 nearby, main-sequence, A-
to M-type stars, and define regions of habitability for the potential existence
of sub-stellar mass companions in each system. [abridged]

play as rival pirate gangs. The goal is to gather more treasure than your

an unvisited vertex. At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure
wins. We will show that this game is NP-Hard, and we will also look at the
structure of this game under the disjunctive sum. We will show that there are
cases where this game behaves like a normal play game, and cases where it
behaves like a mis`ere play game. We then leave an open problem about scoring
play games in general.

estimates of the optimal (shared design) variables are exchanged locally with
neighbor subspaces and then updated by computing a weighted sum of the local

resultant values are projected to local constraint sets. By employing the
existing rules and results of the field, it has shown that the dual task of

Quality control in production process in textile industry has been a key factor
for retaining existence in such competitive market. Automated textile
inspection systems are very useful in this respect, because manual inspection
is time consuming and not accurate enough. Hence, automated textile inspection
systems have been drawing plenty of attention of the researchers of different
countries in order to replace manual inspection. Defect detection and defect
classification are the two major problems that are posed by the research of
automated textile inspection systems. In this paper, we perform an extensive
investigation on the applicability of genetic algorithm (GA) in the context of
textile defect classification using neural network (NN). We observe the effect
of tuning different network parameters and explain the reasons. We empirically
find a suitable NN model in the context of textile defect classification. We
compare the performance of this model with that of the classification models
implemented by others.
