the power spectra of Low Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs), with either a black hole
or a neutron star, have central frequencies that are typical of the orbital
motion time-scale close to the compact object. Thus, twin HF QPOs might carry
the fingerprint of physical effects in a strongly curved space-time. We study
the azimuth phase \phi(t) for orbital motion in the Schwarzschild metric and
calculate the power spectra to check whether they display the features seen in
the observed ones. We show that the timing of \phi(t) on non-closed orbits can
account for the observed twin peak HF QPOs. The uppermost couple of peaks in
frequency has the lower peak that corresponds to the azimuthal frequency
\nu_{\phi}, the upper one to \nu_{\phi}+\nu_r. The azimuth phase temporal
behavior \phi(t) on a slightly eccentric orbit in the Schwarzschild metric is
described by a linear function of slope \nu_{\phi} plus an oscillating term at
the relativistic radial frequency \nu_r. We deduce that the twin peak HF QPOs
might originate from a frequency modulated (FM) signal driven by the kinematics
of orbital motion in a curved space-time.

in the scheme design is the discrete Hodge operator linking gradients to fluxes
by means of a dual mesh, while a structure-preserving discretization is
employed for the gradient and divergence operators. The discrete Hodge operator
is sparse, symmetric positive definite and is assembled cellwise from local
operators. We analyze two schemes depending on whether the potential degrees of
freedom are attached to the vertices or to the cells of the primal mesh. We
derive new functional analysis results on the discrete gradient that are the
counterpart of the Sobolev embeddings. Then, we identify the two design
properties of the local discrete Hodge operators yielding optimal discrete
energy error estimates. Additionally, we show how these operators can be built
from local nonconforming gradient reconstructions using a dual barycentric
mesh. In this case, we also prove an optimal $L^2$-error estimate for the
potential for smooth solutions. Links with existing schemes (finite elements,
finite volumes, mimetic finite differences) are discussed. Numerical results

spectra, arising from a range of density and temperature fluctuations in the
intra-cluster medium (ICM). This is fitted to a single temperature plasma
emission model to provide an estimate of the gas density and temperature, which
are sensitive to the gas inhomogeneities. Therefore, X-ray observations yield a
potentially biased estimate of the thermal gas pressure, P_X. At the same time
Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) observations directly measure the integrated gas
pressure, P_SZ. If the X-ray pressure profiles are strongly biased with respect
to the SZ, then one has the possibility to probe the gas inhomogeneities, even
at scales unresolved by the current generation of telescopes. At the same time,
a weak bias has implications for the interchangeable use of mass proxies like
Y_SZ and Y_X as cosmological probes. In this paper we investigate the
dependence of the bias, defined as b_P(r)=P_X(r)/P_SZ(r)-1, on the
characteristics of fluctuations in the ICM taking into account the correlation
between temperature and density fluctuations. We made a simple prediction of
the irreducible bias in idealised X-ray vs SZ observations using
multi-temperature plasma emission model. We also provide a simple fitting form
to estimate the bias given the distribution of fluctuations. Analysing a sample
of 16 clusters extracted from hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the
median value of bias is within +/-3% within R_500, it decreases to -5% at
R_500<r<1.5R_500 and then rises back to ~0% at r >~ 2R_500. The scatter of
b_P(r) between individual relaxed clusters is small -- at the level of <0.03
within R_500, but turns significantly larger (0.25) and highly skewed at r>~
1.5R_500. For any relaxed cluster we find |b_P(r)| < 15% within R_500, across
different implementations of input physics in the simulations. [abridged]

  We performed Herschel/HIFI observations of the [CII] 158micron line in a
number of PDRs. In all sources we observed at least two hyperfine components of
the [13CII] transition allowing to determine the [CII]/[13CII] intensity ratio,
after some revision of the intrinsic hyperfine ratios. Comparing the intensity
ratios with the results from the updated KOSMA-tau model, we identify cases
dominated by chemical fractionation and cases dominated by the optical depth of
the main isotopic line.
  An observable enhancement of the [CII]/[13CII] intensity ratio due to
chemical fractionation depends mostly on geometry and velocity structure, and
less on the gas density and radiation field. In our observations the
[CII]/[13CII] ratio for the integrated line intensity was always dominated by
the optical depth of the main isotopic line. However, an enhanced intensity
ratio is found for particular velocity components in a few sources: the
red-shifted material in the ultracompact HII region Mon R2, the wings of the
turbulent profile in the Orion Bar, and possibly a blue wing in NGC7023. The
mapping of the [13CII] lines in the Orion Bar allows to derive a C+ column
density map confirming the temperature stratification of the C+ layer, in
agreement with the chemical stratification of the Bar. The C+ column densities
for all sources show that at the position of the [CII] peak emission, a
dominant fraction of the gas-phase carbon is in the form of C+.

applications of Interactive Artificial Intelligence. Of particular note is the
coupling of meta-heuristic search engines with user-provided evaluation and
rating of solutions, usually in the form of Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms
(IEAs). These have a well-documented history of successes, but arguably the
preponderance of IEAs stems from this history, rather than as a conscious
design choice of meta-heuristic based on the characteristics of the problem at
hand. This paper sets out to examine the basis for that assumption, taking as a
case study the domain of interactive software design. We consider a range of
factors that should affect the design choice including ease of use,
scalability, and of course, performance, i.e. that ability to generate good
solutions within the limited number of evaluations available in interactive
work before humans lose focus. We then evaluate three methods, namely greedy
local search, an evolutionary algorithm and ant colony optimization, with a
variety of representations for candidate solutions. Results show that after
suitable parameter tuning, ant colony optimization is highly effective within
interactive search and out-performs evolutionary algorithms with respect to
increasing numbers of attributes and methods in the software design problem.
However, when larger numbers of classes are present in the software design, an
evolutionary algorithm using a naive grouping integer-based representation
appears more scalable.

black holes (BHs). It has been thought for two decades that very few of these
BHs could be retained through the cluster lifetime. With masses ~10 MSun, BHs
are ~20 times more massive than an average cluster star. They segregate into
the cluster core, where they may eventually decouple from the remainder of the
cluster. The small-N core then evaporates on a short timescale. This is the
so-called Spitzer instability. Here we present the results of a full dynamical
simulation of a globular cluster containing many stellar-mass BHs with a
realistic mass spectrum. Our Monte Carlo simulation code includes detailed
treatments of all relevant stellar evolution and dynamical processes. Our main
finding is that old globular clusters could still contain many BHs at present.
In our simulation, we find no evidence for the Spitzer instability. Instead,
most of the BHs remain well-mixed with the rest of the cluster, with only the
innermost few tens of BHs segregating significantly. Over the 12 Gyr evolution,
fewer than half of the BHs are dynamically ejected through strong binary
interactions in the cluster core. The presence of BHs leads to long-term
heating of the cluster, ultimately producing a core radius on the high end of
the distribution for Milky Way globular clusters (and those of other galaxies).
A crude extrapolation from our model suggests that the BH--BH merger rate from
globular clusters could be comparable to the rate in the field.

many fundamental flavors, chiral symmetry is restored via a bulk, first-order
transition. This chirally symmetric phase appears to be analytically connected
with the expected conformal window of many-flavor continuum QCD. We perform
simulations in the chirally symmetric phase at zero quark mass for various
system sizes L, and measure the torelon mass and the Dirac spectrum. We find
that all observables scale with L, which is hence the only infrared length
scale. Thus, the strong-coupling chirally restored phase appears as a
convenient laboratory to study IR-conformality. Finally, we present a
conjecture for the phase diagram of lattice QCD as a function of the bare
coupling and the number of quark flavors.

explicit bound on the size of the index and flexibly assign approximate

a better range labeling if the space budget is increased, thus providing a
direct control over the trade off between index size and the query processing
performance. By using a fast recursive querying method in conjunction with our
index structure, we show that in practice, reachability queries can be answered
in the order of microseconds on an off-the-shelf computer - even for the case
of massive-scale real world graphs. Our claims are supported by an extensive

fact is at odds with predictions based on linear public goods games under weak
selection. That model implies fixation either of cooperators or of defectors,
and the former scenario requires a level of group relatedness larger than the
cost/benefit ratio, being therefore expected only if there is either kin
recognition or a very low cost/benefit ratio, or else under stringent
conditions with low gene flow. This motivated us to study here social evolution
in a large class of group structured populations, with arbitrary
multi-individual interactions among group members and random migration among
groups. Under the assumption of weak selection, we analyze the equilibria and
their stability. For some significant models of social evolution with
non-linear fitness functions, including contingent behavior in iterated public
goods games and threshold models, we show that three regimes occur, depending
on the migration rate among groups. For sufficiently high migration rates, a
rare cooperative allele A cannot invade a monomorphic population of asocial
alleles N. For sufficiently low values of the migration rate, allele A can
invade the population, when rare, and then fixate, eliminating N. For
intermediate values of the migration rate, allele A can invade the population,
when rare, producing a polymorphic equilibrium, in which it coexists with N.
The equilibria and their stability do not depend on the details of the
population structure. The levels of migration (gene flow) and group relatedness
that allow for invasion of the cooperative allele leading to polymorphic
equilibria with the non-cooperative allele are common in nature.

including scaling between the Cx. In gauge theory Lagrangians, number scaling
shows as a scalar boson field, B, with small coupling to matter fields. Freedom
of number scaling is extended to a model with separate number structures
assigned to each point x. Separate collections, Ux, of all mathematical systems
based on numbers, are assigned to each x. Mathematics available to an observer,
Ox, at x is that in Ux. The B field induces scaling between structures in the
different Ux. Effects of B scaling on some aspects of physics and geometry are
described. The lack of experimentally observed scaling means that B(z) is
essentially constant for all points, z, in a region, Z, that can be occupied by

a mode of the posterior distribution in a Bayesian framework. This framework
enriches the set the solutions, as other posterior estimates can be used as a
solution to the inverse problem, such as the posterior mean that can be easier
to compute in practice. In this paper we prove consistency of Bayesian
solutions of an ill-posed linear inverse problem in the Ky Fan metric for a
general class of likelihoods and prior distributions in a finite dimensional
setting. This result can be applied to study infinite dimensional problems by
letting the dimension of the unknown parameter grow to infinity which can be
viewed as discretisation on a grid or spectral approximation of an infinite
dimensional problem. Likelihood and the prior distribution are assumed to be in
an exponential form that includes distributions from the exponential family,
and to be differentiable. The observations can be dependent. No assumption of
finite moments of observations, such as expected value or the variance, is
necessary thus allowing for possibly non-regular likelihoods, and allowing for
non-conjugate and improper priors. If the variance exists, it may be
heteroscedastic, namely, it may depend on the unknown function. We observe
quite a surprising phenomenon when applying our result to the spectral
approximation framework where it is possible to achieve the parametric rate of
convergence, i.e the problem becomes self-regularised. We also consider a
particular case of the unknown parameter being on the boundary of the parameter
set, and show that the rate of convergence in this case is faster than for an
interior point parameter.

stars, can be used as astrophysical laboratories to constrain the properties of
fundamental particles like axions. Comparing the measured cooling rates of
these stars with the expected values from theoretical models allows us to
search for sources of additional cooling due to the emission of weakly
interacting particles. In this paper, we present an independent inference of
the mass of the axion using the recent determination of the evolutionary
cooling rate of R548, the DAV class prototype. We employ a state-of-the-art
code which allows us to perform a detailed asteroseismological fit based on
fully evolutionary sequences. Stellar cooling is the solely responsible of the
rates of change of period with time ($\dot\Pi$) for the DAV class. Thus, the
inclusion of axion emission in these sequences notably influences the
evolutionary timescales, and also the expected pulsational properties of the
DAV stars. This allows us to compare the theoretical $\dot\Pi$ values to the
corresponding empirical rate of change of period with time of R548 to discern
the presence of axion cooling. We found that if the dominant period at 213.13 s
in R548 is associated with a pulsation mode trapped in the hydrogen envelope,
our models indicate the existence of additional cooling in this pulsating white
dwarf, consistent with axions of mass $m_{\rm a} \cos^2 \beta \sim 17.1$ meV at
a 2$\sigma$ confidence level. This determination is in agreement with the value
inferred from another well-studied DAV, G117$-$B15A. We now have two
independent and consistent estimates of the mass of the axion obtained from
DAVs, although additional studies of other pulsating white dwarfs are needed to
confirm this value of the axion mass.

oxygen isotopic ratios, 16O/18O ~ 1 - 10, 12C/13C>=100, and enhancements up to
2.6dex in F and in s-process elements from Zn to La, compared to solar. These
abundances provide stringent constraints on the physical processes during and
after the double-degenerate merger. As shown before O-isotopic ratios observed
in RCB stars cannot result from the dynamic double-degenerate merger phase, and
we investigate now the role of the long-term 1D spherical post-merger evolution
and nucleosynthesis based on realistic hydrodynamic merger progenitor models.
We adopt a model for extra envelope mixing to represent processes driven by
rotation originating in the dynamical merger. Comprehensive nucleosynthesis
post-processing simulations for these stellar evolution models reproduce, for
the first time, the full range of the observed abundances for almost all the
elements measured in RCB stars: 16O/18O ratios between 9 and 15, C-isotopic
ratios above 100, and ~1.4 - 2.35dex F enhancements, along with enrichments in
s-process elements. The nucleosynthesis processes in our models constrain the
length and temperature in the dynamic merger shell-of-fire feature as well as
the envelope mixing in the post-merger phase. s-process elements originate
either in the shell-of-fire merger feature or during the post-merger evolution,
but the contribution from the AGB progenitors is negligible. The post-merger
envelope mixing must eventually cease ~ 10^6yr after the dynamic merger phase,

equilibrium liquid is transformed to a non-equilibrium disordered solid, or
vice versa. Associated response functions, such as heat capacities, are
markedly different on cooling than on heating, and the response to melting a
glass depends markedly on the cooling protocol by which the glass was formed.
This paper shows how this irreversible behavior can be interpreted
quantitatively in terms of an East-model picture of localized excitations (or
soft spots) in which molecules can move with a specific direction, and from
which excitations with the same directionality of motion can appear or
disappear in adjacent regions. As a result of this facilitated dynamics,
excitations become correlated in a hierarchical fashion. These correlations are
manifested in the dynamic heterogeneity of the supercooled liquid phase. While
equilibrium thermodynamics is virtually featureless, a non-equilibrium glass
phase emerges when the model is driven out of equilibrium with a finite cooling
rate. The correlation length of this emergent phase is large and increases with
decreasing cooling rate. A spatially and temporally resolved fictive
temperature encodes memory of its preparation. Parameters characterizing the
model can be determined from reversible transport data, and with these
parameters, predictions of the model agree well with irreversible differential
scanning calorimetry.

decomposed the broad iron line into 3 separate components:
Fe\textsc{i}-K$\alpha$, Fe\textsc{i}-K$\beta$ and Fe\textsc{xxiv-xxv}K$\alpha$.
It is unclear how both neutral and almost fully ionised iron can exist
simultaneously, however we suggest this could be evidence that the compact
object is embedded in the circumstellar material. This doesn't appear to be
consistent with the X-ray flux and spectrum of the source, which has remained
essentially unchanged since the initial outburst. The iron abundance implied by
the ratio of the neutral Fe-K$\alpha$ and Fe-K$\beta$ is compatible with solar.
We search for lags in the neutral Fe-K$\alpha$ with respect to the continuum
and find marginal evidence for a lag at ~10 ks. We interpret this as the light
crossing time of the torus which would suggest that the neutral iron is located
at a radius of 10 AU. This result depends on several assumptions including the
distance to the system, the inclination, the mass of system and the orbital
period none of which are known with any great certainty. Better constraints on
these system parameters and further observations of this system are required to

general means to study the theoretical predictions of cosmological structure
formation models for gravitational lensing. Due to the finite number of
particles, the density field only becomes smooth on scales beyond a few times
the local mean interparticle separation. This introduces noise on the
gravitational lensing properties such as the surface mass density, the
deflection angles and the magnification. At some small-scale mass limit, the
noise due to the discreteness of the N-body simulation becomes comparable to
the effects of physical substructures. We present analytic expressions to
quantify the Poisson noise and study its scaling with the particle number of
the simulation and the Lagrangian smoothing size. We use the Phoenix set of
simulations, currently the largest available dark matter simulations of
clusters to study the effect of limited numerical resolution and the
gravitational strong lensing effects of substructure. We quantify the smallest
resolved substructure, in the sense that the effect of the substructure on any
strong lensing property is significant compared to the noise, and we find that
the result is roughly independent of the strong lensing property. A simple
scaling relates the smallest resolved substructures in a simulation with the

These are compared with observed bulge and disc colours and stellar absorption

populations depend only on the galaxy subhalo mass while the disc quenching
depends on the cluster environment are acceptable fits to the data. An
exponential disc quenching timescale of 3 - 3.5 Gyr is preferred. Models with
short ($\lesssim 1$ Gyr) quenching timescales yield cluster-centric gradients
in disc colours and Balmer line indices that are too steep compared to

groups prior to cluster infall (""pre-processing""), finding that such models are
a better fit to the data than models without pre-processing and require similar

for galaxies falling within about 0.5 $r_{200}$. Finally, we have examined
models with short quenching timescales of 1 Gyr, but a long delay time of 3 Gyr

that the environments of rich clusters must impact star formation rates of

typical halo spends within the virial radius of a cluster. This scenario
favours gentler quenching mechanisms such as slow ""strangulation"" over more
rapid ram-pressure stripping.

a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of adiabatic density perturbations with
amplitude and tilt consistent with observation, and a potentially observable
level of non-Gaussianity and tensor modes. The power spectrum has a small
oscillatory component that does not decay away during inflation, with a period
set approximately by the light-crossing time of the compact dimension(s). Since
the ingredients are fluxes threading compact dimensions, this mechanism fits
naturally into the string landscape, but does not appear to suffer from the eta

standard estimator is constructed to be optimal in the zero-signal (i.e.,
Gaussian) limit. When applied to CMB maps which have a detectable level of
non-Gaussianity the standard estimator is no longer optimal, possibly limiting
the sensitivity of future observations to a non-Gaussian signal. Previous
studies have proposed an improved estimator by using a realization-dependent
normalization. Under the approximations of a flat sky and a vanishingly thin
last-scattering surface, these studies showed that the variance of this
improved estimator can be significantly smaller than the variance of the
standard estimator when applied to non-Gaussian CMB maps. Here this technique
is generalized to the full sky and to include the full radiation transfer
function, yielding expressions for the improved estimator that can be directly
applied to CMB maps. The ability of this estimator to reduce the variance as
compared to the standard estimator in the face of a significant non-Gaussian
signal is re-assessed using the full CMB transfer function. As a result of the
late time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, the performance of the improved
estimator is degraded. If CMB maps are first cleaned of the late-time ISW
effect using a tracer of foreground structure, such as a galaxy survey or a
measurement of CMB weak lensing, the new estimator does remove a majority of
the excess variance, allowing a higher significance detection of fnl.

stellar mass and (2) both stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) to
significantly enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the weak [O III] 4363 and [O

metallicity measurements span three decades in stellar mass from
log(Mstar/Msun) = 7.4-10.5, which allows the direct method mass-metallicity
relation to simultaneously capture the high-mass turnover and extend a full
decade lower in mass than previous studies that employed more uncertain strong
line methods. The direct method mass-metallicity relation rises steeply at low
mass (O/H ~ Mstar^{1/2}) until it turns over at log(Mstar/Msun) = 8.9 and
asymptotes to 12 + log(O/H) = 8.8 at high mass. The direct method
mass-metallicity relation has a steeper slope, a lower turnover mass, and a
factor of two to three greater dependence on SFR than strong line
mass-metallicity relations. Furthermore, the SFR-dependence appears monotonic
with stellar mass, unlike strong line mass-metallicity relations. We also
measure the N/O abundance ratio, an important tracer of star formation history,
and find the clear signature of primary and secondary nitrogen enrichment. N/O
correlates tightly with oxygen abundance, and even more so with stellar mass.

we study a set of simulated spheroids formed in isolated binary mergers as well
as the formation within the cosmological framework. The total stellar plus dark
matter density profiles can always be described by a power law with an index of
gamma approx -2.1 with a tendency toward steeper slopes for more compact,
lower-mass ellipticals. In the binary mergers the amount of gas involved in the
merger determines the precise steepness of the slope. This agrees with results
from the cosmological simulations where ellipticals with steeper slopes have a
higher fraction of stars formed in situ. Each gas-poor merger event evolves the
slope toward gamma ~ -2, once this slope is reached further merger events do
not change it anymore. All our ellipticals have flat intrinsic combined stellar
and dark matter velocity dispersion profiles. We conclude that flat velocity
dispersion profiles and total density distributions with a slope of gamma ~ -2

Conformal iterated function systems are more flexible models than similarities.

regularity of the Euclidean distance function to the fractal if the ambient
dimension exceeds three, and a uniform integrability condition to bound the
curvature on ""overlap sets"". A limited converse shows the integrability
condition is sharp. We discuss simpler, sufficient conditions.

quiescent galaxies from z~2 to today. We present X-Shooter spectra from the UV
to NIR and dynamical mass measurements of 5 quiescent massive (>10^11 Msun)
galaxies at z~2. This triples the sample of z>1.5 galaxies with well
constrained (dsigma <100 km/s) velocity dispersion measurements. From spectral
population synthesis modeling we find that these galaxies have stellar ages
that range from 0.5-2 Gyr, with no signs of ongoing star formation. We measure
velocity dispersions (290-450 km/s) from absorption lines and find that they
are 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of galaxies in the SDSS at the same mass.
Sizes are measured using GALFIT from HST-WFC3 H160 and UDS K-band images. The
dynamical masses correspond well to the SED based stellar masses, with
dynamical masses that are ~15% higher. We find that M_*/M_dyn may decrease
slightly with time, which could reflect the increase of the dark matter
fraction within an increasing effective radius. We combine different stellar
kinematic studies from the literature, and examine the structural evolution
from z~2 to z~0: we confirm that at fixed dynamical mass, the effective radius
increases by a factor of ~2.8, and the velocity dispersion decreases by a
factor of ~1.7. The mass density within one effective radius decreases by a
factor of ~20, while within a fixed physical radius (1 kpc) it decreases only
mildly (~2). When we allow for an evolving mass limit by selecting a population
of galaxies at fixed number density, a stronger size growth with time is found
(~4), velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ~1.4, and interestingly, the
mass density within 1 kpc is consistent with no evolution. This finding
suggests that massive quiescent galaxies at ~2 grow inside-out, consistent with
the expectations from minor mergers.

instigating outflows in other systems, deep imaging of NGC 1266 as well as
stellar kinematic observations from SAURON, have failed to provide evidence
that NGC 1266 has recently been involved in a major interaction. The molecular
gas and the instantaneous SF tracers indicate that the current sites of star
formation are located in a hypercompact disk within 200 pc of the nucleus (Fig.
1; SF rate ~ 2 Msuns/yr). On the other hand, tracers of recent star formation,
such as the H{\beta} absorption map from SAURON and stellar population analysis
show that the young stars are distributed throughout a larger area of the
galaxy than current star formation. As the AGN at the center of NGC 1266
continues to drive cold gas out of the galaxy, we expect star formation rates
to decline as the star formation is ultimately quenched. Thus, NGC 1266 is in
the midst of a key portion of its evolution and continued studies of this
unique galaxy may help improve our understanding of how galaxies transition

generating functions, in contrast with the known D-finite generating functions
for the 321-avoiding (i.e., 3-noncrossing) case. Our approach also provides a
more direct proof of a formula of B\'ona for the number of 1342-avoiding
permutations. Additionally, we give a bijection proving the
shape-Wilf-equivalence of the patterns 321 and 213 which greatly simplifies
existing proofs by Backelin--West--Xin and Jel\'{\i}nek, and provides an
extension of work of Gouyou-Beauchamps for matchings with fixed points.
Finally, we classify pairs of patterns of length 3 according to
shape-Wilf-equivalence, and enumerate matchings and partitions avoiding a pair
in most of the resulting equivalence classes.

clusters) so that objects within the same cluster are more similar to each
other than to those in different clusters. Spectral clustering is a now
well-known method for clustering which utilizes the spectrum of the data
similarity matrix to perform this separation. Since the method relies on
solving an eigenvector problem, it is computationally expensive for large
datasets. To overcome this constraint, approximation methods have been
developed which aim to reduce running time while maintaining accurate
classification. In this article, we summarize and experimentally evaluate
several approximation methods for spectral clustering. From an applications
standpoint, we employ spectral clustering to solve the so-called attrition
problem, where one aims to identify from a set of employees those who are
likely to voluntarily leave the company from those who are not. Our study sheds
light on the empirical performance of existing approximate spectral clustering
methods and shows the applicability of these methods in an important business
optimization related problem.

(Y~0.248-0.280) are able to reproduce the observed periods and amplitudes of
the RR Lyrae variables, as well as the frequency of fundamental and
first-overtone RR Lyrae stars. Comparison of number ratios amongst the blue and
red horizontal branch components and the two observed subgiant branches also
suggest that the RR Lyrae variables originated from the progeny of the bright
subgiant branch. The RR Lyrae variables with a slightly enhanced helium
(Y~0.270-0.280) have longer periods at a given amplitude, as is seen with
Oosterhoff II (OoII) RR Lyrae variables, whereas the RR Lyrae variables with
Y~0.248-0.270 have shorter periods, exhibiting properties of Oosterhoff I (OoI)
variables. This correlation does suggest that the pulsational properties of RR
Lyrae stars can be very useful for tracing the various sub-populations and can
provide suitable constraints on the multiple population phenomenon. It appears
of great interest to explore whether this conclusion can be generalized to
other globular clusters hosting multiple populations.

bipolar -- geometry with a low inclination of the axis to the line of sight,
i=15+/-5 degrees, compatible with published results from high angular
resolution optical spectro-interferometry. The structure is similar to that
observed in the other short orbital period recurrent novae during their nebular
stages. We show that the electron density scales as $t^{-3}$ as expected from a
ballistically ejected constant mass shell; there is no need to invoke a
continuing mass outflow following the eruption. The derived mass for the ejecta
with filling factor f ~ 3%, M_ej ~ 2E-6$M_sun is similar to that obtained for
other recurrent nova ejecta but inconsistent with the previously reported

[arXiv:0906.0315]), the inflationary account for the emergence of the seeds of
cosmic structure falls short of actually explaining the generation of
primordial anisotropies and inhomogeneities. This description starts from a
symmetric background, and invokes symmetric dynamics, so it cannot explain
asymmetries. To generate asymmetries, we present an application of the
Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model of wave function collapse (P.
Pearle, Phys. Rev. A 39, 2277, (1989); G. C. Ghirardi, P. Pearle and A. Rimini,
Phys. Rev. A42, 78 (1990)) in the context of inflation. This modification of
quantum dynamics introduces a stochastic non-unitary component to the evolution
of the inflaton field perturbations. This leads to passage from a homogeneous
and isotropic stage to another, where the quantum uncertainties in the initial
state of inflation transmute into the primordial inhomogeneities and
anisotropies. We examine requirements for, and show how to achieve,
compatibility with the precise observations of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) radiation.

feedback strongly suppress core fragmentation, leading to the production of
single star systems rather than small clusters. We find that the two processes
are efficient at suppressing fragmentation in different regimes, with the
feedback most effective in the dense, central region and the magnetic field
most effective in more diffuse, outer regions. Thus, the combination of the two
is much more effective at suppressing fragmentation than either one considered
in isolation. Our work suggests that typical massive cores, which have
mass-to-flux ratios of about 2 relative to critical, likely form a single star
system, but that cores with weaker fields may form a small star cluster. This
result helps us understand why the observed relationship between the core mass
function and the stellar initial mass function holds even for ~100 Msun cores
with many thermal Jeans masses of material. We also demonstrate that a ~40 AU
Keplerian disk is able to form in our simulations, despite the braking effect
caused by the strong magnetic field.

glass transition of hard-spheres become increasingly bad when dimensionality
increases, whereas replica theory predicts a correct scaling. Nevertheless if
one focuses on the regime around the dynamical transition in three dimensions,
Mode-Coupling results are far more convincing than replica theory predictions.
It seems thus necessary to reconcile the two theoretic approaches in order to
obtain a theory that interpolates between low-dimensional, Mode-Coupling
results, and ""mean-field"" results from replica theory. Even though quantitative
results for the dynamical transition issued from replica theory are not
accurate in low dimensions, two different approximation schemes --small cage
expansion and replicated Hyper-Netted-Chain (RHNC)-- provide the correct
qualitative picture for the transition, namely a discontinuous jump of a static
order parameter from zero to a finite value. The purpose of this work is to
develop a systematic expansion around the RHNC result in powers of the static
order parameter, and to calculate the first correction in this expansion.
Interestingly, this correction involves the static three-body correlations of
the liquid. More importantly, we separately demonstrate that higher order terms
in the expansion are quantitatively relevant at the transition, and that the
usual mode-coupling kernel, involving two-body direct correlation functions of
the liquid, cannot be recovered from static computations.

origin of life is not new. However, the likelihood of autocatalytic sets
emerging spontaneously has long been debated. Recently, progress has been made
along two different lines. Experimental results have shown that autocatalytic
sets can indeed emerge in real chemical systems, and theoretical work has shown
that the existence of such self-sustaining sets is highly likely in formal
models of chemical systems. Here, we take a first step towards merging these
two lines of work by constructing and investigating a formal model of a real
chemical system of RNA replicators exhibiting autocatalytic sets.
  Results: We show that the formal model accurately reproduces recent
experimental results on an RNA replicator system, in particular how the system
goes through a sequence of larger and larger autocatalytic sets, and how a
cooperative (autocatalytic) system can outcompete an equivalent selfish system.
Moreover, the model provides additional insights that could not be obtained
from experiments alone, and it suggests several experimentally testable
hypotheses.
  Conclusions: Given these additional insights and predictions, the modeling
framework provides a better and more detailed understanding of the nature of
chemical systems in general and the emergence of autocatalytic sets in
particular. This provides an important first step in combining experimental and
theoretical work on autocatalytic sets in the context of the orgin of life.

solar wind-like (\propto h^{-2}) density profile yields a density of 1.2x10^6

multivalent catalytic walker with flexible, uncoordinated legs can transform
the free energy of surface-bound substrate sites into mechanical work and
undergo biased, superdiffusive motion, even in opposition to an external load
force. The walker in the model lacks any inherent orientation of body or track,
and its legs have no chemomechanical coupling other than the passive constraint
imposed by their connection to a common body. Yet, under appropriate kinetic
conditions the walker's motion is biased in the direction of unvisited sites,
which allows the walker to move nearly ballistically away from the origin as
long as a local supply of unmodified substrate sites is available. The
multivalent random walker model is mathematically formulated as a
continuous-time Markov process and is studied numerically. We use Monte Carlo
simulations to generate ensemble estimates of the mean squared displacement and
mean work done for this non-ergodic system. Our results show that a residence
time bias between visited and unvisited sites leads to superdiffusive motion
over significant times and distances. This mechanism can be used to adapt any
enzyme--substrate system with appropriate kinetics for use as a functional
chemical implementation of a molecular motor, without the need for structural
anisotropy or conformationally mediated chemomechanical coordination.

despite the numerous works dedicated to IA, the feasibility conditions of IA
remains unclear for most network topologies. The IA feasibility analysis is
challenging as the IA constraints are sets of high-degree polynomials, for
which no systematic tool to analyze the solvability conditions exists. In this
work, by developing a new mathematical framework that maps the solvability of
sets of polynomial equations to the linear independence of their first-order
terms, we propose a sufficient condition that applies to MIMO interference
networks with general configurations. We have further proved that this
sufficient condition matches with the necessary conditions under a wide range
of configurations. These results further consolidate the theoretical basis of
IA.

applied to analyze high order tensors. Existing CPD methods use alternating
least square (ALS) iterations and hence need to unfold tensors to each of the
$N$ modes frequently, which is one major bottleneck of efficiency for
large-scale data and especially when $N$ is large. To overcome this problem, in
this paper we proposed a new CPD method which converts the original $N$th
($N>3$) order tensor to a 3rd-order tensor first. Then the full CPD is realized
by decomposing this mode reduced tensor followed by a Khatri-Rao product
projection procedure. This way is quite efficient as unfolding to each of the
$N$ modes are avoided, and dimensionality reduction can also be easily
incorporated to further improve the efficiency. We show that, under mild
conditions, any $N$th-order CPD can be converted into a 3rd-order case but
without destroying the essential uniqueness, and theoretically gives the same
results as direct $N$-way CPD methods. Simulations show that, compared with
state-of-the-art CPD methods, the proposed method is more efficient and escape
from local solutions more easily.

algorithm is proposed for maximization of the system capacity (bit/s). In
particular, closed-form power allocation and antenna allocation policies are
derived in each iteration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed
iterative resource allocation algorithm achieves a close-to-optimal performance
in a small number of iterations and unveil a trade-off between system capacity
and the number of activated antennas: Activating all antennas may not be a good
solution for system capacity maximization when a system with a per antenna
power cost is considered.

especially focusing on their physical structures, such as the spin axis, the
rotation period and the shape. The long distance between Earth observers and
asteroids makes it impossible to get the shape and other parameters of
asteroids directly with the exception of the NEAs (Near Earth Asteroids) and
others passed by some spacecrafts. Generally photometric measurement is still
the main way to obtain the research data for asteroids now, i.e. the
lightcurves recording the brightness and positions of asteroids. Supposing that
the shape of the asteroid is a triaxial ellipsoid with a stable spinning
status, a new method is present in this article to reconstruct the shape models
of asteroids from the lightcurves, with the other physical parameters together.
By applying a special curvature function, the method calculates the brightness
integration on a unit sphere and Lebedev Quadrature is employed for the
discretization. At last the method searches the optimal solution by
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm to minimize the residual of the brightness. By
adopting this method not only related physical parameters of asteroids can be
obtained at a reasonable accuracy, but also a simple shape model of Ellipsoid
can be generated for reconstructing more sophisticated shape model further.

of geometric shapes. Mathematically, a shape can be modeled as an
un-parameterized immersed sub-manifold, which is the notion of shape used here.
Endowing shape space with a Riemannian metric opens up the world of Riemannian
differential geometry with geodesics, gradient flows and curvature.
Unfortunately, the simplest such metric induces vanishing path-length distance
on shape space. This discovery by Michor and Mumford was the starting point to
a quest for stronger, meaningful metrics that should be able to distinguish
salient features of the shapes. Sobolev metrics are a very promising approach
to that. They come in two flavors: Outer metrics which are induced from metrics
on the diffeomorphism group of ambient space, and inner metrics which are
defined intrinsically to the shape. In this work, Sobolev inner metrics are
developed and treated in a very general setting. There are no restrictions on
the dimension of the immersed space or of the ambient space, and ambient space
is not required to be flat. It is shown that the path-length distance induced
by Sobolev inner metrics does not vanish. The geodesic equation and the
conserved quantities arising from the symmetries are calculated, and
well-posedness of the geodesic equation is proven. Finally examples of
numerical solutions to the geodesic equation are presented.

with special emphasis on Chow's Theorem. As an application, a regularity result
for the Poincar\'e Lemma is presented.
  At the beginning, the definitions of a subriemannian geometry, horizontal
vector fields and horizontal curves are given. Then the question arises: Can
any two points be connected by a horizontal curve? Chow's Theorem gives an
affirmative answer for bracket generating distributions. (A distribution is
called bracket generating if horizontal vector fields and their iterated Lie
brackets span the whole tangent space.)
  We present three different proofs of Chow's Theorem; each one is interesting
in its own. The first proof is based on the theory of Stefan and Sussmann
regarding integrability of singular distributions. The second proof is
elementary and gives some insight in the shape of subriemannian balls. The
third proof is based on infinite dimensional analysis of the endpoint map.
  Finally, the study of the endpoint map allows us to prove a regularity result
for the Poincar\'e Lemma in a form suited to subriemannian geometry: If for
some $r \geq 0$ all horizontal derivatives of a given function $f$ are known to
be $r$ times continuously differentiable, then so is $f$.
  Sections 1 to 3 are the common work of Martin Bauer and Philipp Harms.

spherical symmetry, assuming thermal equilibrium in calculating the dust

the photoelectric heating and extended the parametrization range for the
photoelectric heating toward high densities and UV fields. We revised the
computation of the H2 formation on grain surfaces to include the Eley-Rideal
effect, thus allowing for high-temperature H2 formation. We demonstrate how the
different optical properties, temperatures, and heating and cooling
capabilities of the grains influence the physical and chemical structure of a
model cloud. The most influential modification is the treatment of H2 formation
on grain surfaces that allows for chemisorption. This increases the total H2
formation significantly and the connected H2 formation heating provides a
profound heating contribution in the outer layers of the model clumps. The
contribution of PAH surfaces to the photoelectric heating and H2 formation
provides a boost to the temperature of outer cloud layers, which is clearly
traced by high-J CO lines. Increasing the fraction of small grains in the dust
size distribution results in hotter gas in the outer cloud layers caused by
more efficient heating and cooler cloud centers, which is in turn caused by the
more efficient FUV extinction.

but the physical properties of their larger scale environment are poorly known.
In this work, we aim at characterising the effects of clustered star formation
and feedback of massive stars on the surrounding medium by studying the
distribution of warm gas through mid-J 12CO and 13CO data. We present APEX
12CO(6-5), (7-6), 13CO(6-5), (8-7) and HIFI 13CO(10-9) maps of the star forming
region G327.36-0.6. We infer the physical properties of the emitting gas on
large scales through a LTE analysis, while we apply a more sophisticated LVG
approach on selected positions. Maps of all lines are dominated in intensity by
the PDR around the Hii region G327.3-0.5. Mid-J 12CO emission is detected over
the whole extent of the maps with excitation temperatures ranging from 20K up
to 80K in the gas around the Hii region, and H2 column densities from few 10^21
cm-2 in the inter-clump gas to 3 10^22 cm-2 towards the hot core G327.3-0.6.
The warm gas (traced by 12 and 13CO(6-5) emission) is only a small percentage
(10%) of the total gas in the IRDC, while it reaches values up to 35% of the
total gas in the ring surrounding the Hii region. The 12CO ladders are
qualitatively compatible with PDR models for high density gas, but the much
weaker than predicted 13CO emission suggests that it comes from a large number
of clumps along the line of sight. All lines are detected in the inter-clump
gas when averaged over a large region with an equivalent radius of 50""
(~0.8pc), implying that the mid-J 12CO and 13CO inter-clump emission is due to
high density components with low filling factor. Finally, the detection of the
13CO(10-9) line allows to disentangle the effects of gas temperature and gas
density on the CO emission, which are degenerate in the APEX observations
alone.

arises when quantum correlations are lost or neglected in measurements. To date
the weakness of this interpretation has been the lack of a clear experimental
signature that allows it to be tested. Here we provide a simple experimentally
accessible scheme that enables just that. We also discuss a Bayesian technique
that could, in principle, allow experiments to confirm the theory to any
desired degree of accuracy and we present precision requirements that are

find that strong C^+ fractionation is possible in cool C^+ gas. Optical
thickness as well as excitation effects produce intensity ratios between 40 and
400. The fractionation of CO in PDRs is significantly different from the
diffuse interstellar medium. PDR model results never show a fractionation ratio
of the CO column density larger than the elemental ratio. Isotope-selective
photo-dissociation is always dominated by the isotope-selective chemistry in
dense PDR gas. The fractionation of C, CH, CH^+, and HCO^+ is studied in
detail, showing that the fractionation of C, CH and CH^+ is dominated by the
fractionation of their parental species. The light hydrides chemically derive
from C^+, and, consequently, their fractionation state is coupled to that of
C^+. The fractionation of C is a mixed case depending on whether formation from
CO or HCO^+ dominates. Ratios of the emission lines of [C II], [C I], ^{13}CO,

directed graph is solvable in polynomial time. In fact, it suffices to fix the
number of faces needed to cover all sources and sinks. Moreover, the method can
be extended to any fixed compact orientable surface (instead of the plane) and
to rooted trees (instead of paths).
  Our approach is algebraic and is based on cohomology over graph (nonabelian)
groups. More precisely, let $D=(V,A)$ be a directed graph and let $(G,\cdot)$
be a group. Call two function $\phi,\psi:A\to G$ {\em cohomologous} if there
exists a function $p:V\to G$ such that $p(u)\cdot\phi(a)\cdot
p(w)^{-1}=\psi(a)$ for each arc $a=(u,w)$. Now given a function $\phi:A\to G$
we want to find a function $\psi$ cohomologous to $\phi$ such that each
$\psi(a)$ belongs to a prescribed subset $H(a)$ of $G$. We give a
polynomial-time algorithm for this problem in case $G$ is a graph group and
each $H(a)$ is closed (i.e., if word $xyz$ belongs to $H(a)$ then also word $y$
belongs to $H(a)$).
  The method also implies that such a $\psi$ exists, if and only if for each

the large scale distribution of matter on the formation and evolution of dark
matter haloes and galaxies. One main difficulty in answering this question lies
in the absence of a robust and natural way of identifying the large scale
environments and their characteristics. This work summarizes the NEXUS+
formalism which extends and improves our multiscale scale-space MMF method. The
new algorithm is very successful in tracing the Cosmic Web components, mainly
due to its novel filtering of the density in logarithmic space. The method, due
to its multiscale and hierarchical character, has the advantage of detecting
all the cosmic structures, either prominent or tenuous, without preference for
a certain size or shape. The resulting filamentary and wall networks can easily
be characterized by their direction, thickness, mass density and density
profile. These additional environmental properties allows to us to investigate
not only the effect of environment on haloes, but also how it correlates with
the environment characteristics.

to generate isospectral and non-isospectral flows. This approach provides an
integrable master symmetry and simple zero curvature representations of flows.
The obtained flows are then proved to generate a Lie algebra w.r.t. Lie product
${\llbracket} \cdot, \cdot {\rrbracket}$, which leads to two sets of symmetries
for the isospectral differential-difference Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy,
and the symmetries generate a Lie algebra, too. The algebra of flows also
provide recursive relations of the flows via the master symmetry, which are
then used to derive Hamiltonian structures for both isospectral and
non-isospectral differential-difference Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies. The
Hamiltonians generate a Lie algebra w.r.t. the Poisson bracket
$\{\cdot,\cdot\}$. The Hamiltonians together with symmetries lead to two sets
of conserved quantities for the whole isospectral differential-difference
Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchy and they also generate a Lie algebra. All the
obtained algebras have same basic structures. Then, we provide a continuum
limit which is different from Miwa's transformation. By means of defining
\textit{degrees} of some elements with respect to the continuum limit, we find
that the differential-difference Kadomtsev-Petviashvili hierarchies together
with their Lax triads, zero curvature representations and all integrable
characteristics go to their continuous counterparts in the continuum limit. We
also explain the basic structure deformation of Lie algebras in the continuum
limit.

independent latent sources that linearly combine to generate data points.
However, instead of using a standard sparse prior such as a Laplace
distribution, we study the application of a more flexible `spike-and-slab'
distribution which models the absence or presence of a source's contribution
independently of its strength if it contributes. We investigate two approaches
to optimize the parameters of spike-and-slab sparse coding: a novel truncated
EM approach and, for comparison, an approach based on standard factored
variational distributions. The truncated approach can be regarded as a
variational approach with truncated posteriors as variational distributions. In
applications to source separation we find that both approaches improve the
state-of-the-art in a number of standard benchmarks, which argues for the use
of `spike-and-slab' priors for the corresponding data domains. Furthermore, we
find that the truncated EM approach improves on the standard factored approach
in source separation tasks$-$which hints to biases introduced by assuming
posterior independence in the factored variational approach. Likewise, on a
standard benchmark for image denoising, we find that the truncated EM approach
improves on the factored variational approach. While the performance of the
factored approach saturates with increasing numbers of hidden dimensions, the
performance of the truncated approach improves the state-of-the-art for higher

Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars and Red Supergiants (RSGs) observed with
the PACS photometer on-board Herschel at 70 and 160 {\mu}m. For most of these
objects, the dusty AGB wind differs from spherical symmetry and the wind shape
can be subdivided into four classes. In the present paper we concentrate on the
influence of a companion on the morphology of the stellar wind. Literature was
searched to find binaries in the MESS sample and these are subsequently linked
to their wind-morphology class to assert that the binaries are not distributed
equally among the classes. In the second part of the paper we concentrate on
the circumstellar environment of the two prominent objects R Aqr and W Aql.
Each shows a characteristic signature of a companion interaction with the
stellar wind. For the symbiotic star R Aqr, PACS revealed two perfectly
opposing arms which in part reflect the previously observed ring-shaped nebula
in the optical. However, from the far-IR there is evidence that the emitting
region is elliptical rather than circular. The outline of the wind of W Aql
seems to follow a large Archimedean spiral formed by the orbit of the companion
but also shows strong indications of an interaction with the interstellar
medium. The nature of the companion of W Aql was investigated and the magnitude
of the orbital period supports the size of the spiral outline.

coefficients for passive scalars in turbulent rotating flows. Effective
diffusion coefficients in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the
rotations axis are obtained by studying the diffusion of an imposed initial
profile for the passive scalar, and calculated by measuring the scalar average
concentration and average spatial flux as a function of time. The Rossby and
Schmidt numbers are varied to quantify their effect on the effective diffusion.
It is find that rotation reduces scalar diffusivity in the perpendicular
direction. The perpendicular diffusion can be estimated from mixing length
arguments using the characteristic velocities and lengths perpendicular to the
rotation axis. Deviations are observed for small Schmidt numbers, for which
turbulent transport decreases and molecular diffusion becomes more significant.

subject to a classical Gaussian noise. Two complementary limits of the noise
being fast and slow compared to characteristic Landau-Zener tunnel times are
discussed. The analytical solution of a density matrix (Bloch) equation is
given for a long time asymptotic of transition probability. It is demonstrated
that the transition probability induced/assisted by the fast noise can be
obtained through a procedure of {\it Bloch's equation averaging} with further
reduction it to a master equation. In contrast to the case of fast noise, the
transition probability for LZ transition induced/assisted by the slow classical
noise can be obtained by averaging a {\it solution} of Bloch's equation over
the noise realization. As a result, the transition probability is described by
the activation Arrhenius law. The approximate solution of the Bloch's equation
at finite times is written in terms of Fresnel's integrals and interpreted in
terms of interference pattern. We discuss consequences of a local isomorphism
between SU(2) and SO(3) groups and connections between Schr\""odinger and Bloch

state (trion) for arbitrarily small interaction, while in D=2, due to the
stronger influence of finite-size effects, we are not able to provide
conclusive evidence of the existence of a finite threshold for trion formation.
Our data are however compatible with a threshold value which vanishes
logarithmically with the size of the system. Moreover we are able to identify
the presence of a fine structure inside the spectrum, which is associated with
off-site trionic states. The characterization of these states shows that only
the long-distance behavior of the eigenstate wavefunctions provides clear-cut
signatures about the nature of bound states and that onsite observables are not
enough to discriminate between them. The inclusion of a three-body constraint
due to losses promotes these off-site trions to the role of lowest energy
states, at least in the strong-coupling regime.

theoretical statistics communities, as well as throughout the wider world of
science, engineering, business, etc. In many applications, we are faced with
the reality of errorfully observed graphs. That is, the existence of an edge
between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this paper, we
consider a graph $G = (V,E)$. We wish to perform an inference task -- the
inference task considered here is ""vertex classification"". However, we do not
observe $G$; rather, for each potential edge $uv \in {{V}\choose{2}}$ we
observe an ""edge-feature"" which we use to classify $uv$ as edge/not-edge. Thus
we errorfully observe $G$ when we observe the graph $\widetilde{G} =
(V,\widetilde{E})$ as the edges in $\widetilde{E}$ arise from the
classifications of the ""edge-features"", and are expected to be errorful.
Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge-features we
observe -- more informative edge-features are more expensive, and hence the
number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of
the edge-features. We studied this problem by formulating a quantity/quality
tradeoff for a simple class of random graphs model, namely the stochastic
blockmodel. We then consider a simple but optimal vertex classifier for
classifying $v$ and we derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for
subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off. The optimal operating
points for the quantity/quality trade-off are surprising and illustrate the
issue that methods for intermediate tasks should be chosen to maximize
performance for the ultimate inference task. Finally, we investigate the
quantity/quality tradeoff for errorful obesrvations of the {\it C.\ elegans}
connectome graph.

observations of the blazar CTA 102 during its 2006 radio flare, the strongest

opportunity to investigate the evolution of the physical properties of blazars,
especially during these flaring events. We want to study the kinematic changes
in the source during the strong radio outburst in April 2006 and test the
assumption of a shock-shock interaction. This assumption is based on the
analysis and modeling of the single-dish observations of CTA\,102 (Paper I). In
this paper we study the kinematics of CTA 102 at several frequencies using VLBI
observations. From the modeled jet features we derived estimates for the
evolution of the physical parameters, such as the particle density and the
magnetic field. Furthermore, we combined our observations during the 2006 flare
with long-term VLBA monitoring of the source at 15 GHz and 43 GHz. We
cross-identified seven features throughout our entire multifrequency
observations and find evidence of two possible recollimation shocks around 0.1
mas (deprojected 18 pc at a viewing angle of 2.6 degrees) and 6.0 mas
(deprojected 1 kpc) from the core. The 43 GHz observations reveal a feature
ejected at epoch $t_\mathrm{ej}=2005.9\pm0.2$, which could be connected to the

observed composition of many ecological communities but it relies on strict
demographic equivalence among species and provides no room for evolutionary

the neutral theory within the Darwinian framework. In a fitness landscape with
a quadratic maximum, typical of quantitative traits, selection restricts the
extant species to have traits close to optimal, so that the fitness differences
between surviving species are small. For sufficiently small mutation steps, the
community structure fits perfectly to the Fisher log-series species abundance
distribution. The theory is relatively insensitive to moderate amounts of
environmental noise, wherein the location of the fitness maximum changes by
amounts of order the width of the noise-free distribution. Adding very large
environmental noise to the model qualitatively changes the abundance
distributions, converting the exponential fall-off of large species to a
power-law decay, typical of a neutral model with environmental noise.

cueing (RAC) enhances gait recovery in neurological disorders. The activation
of specific sensory-motor processes, which may partially replace impaired
neural pathways, is likely the cause of the observed benefits. Nonlinear
indexes, such as scaling exponents and Lyapunov exponents, have been proposed
to characterize RAC effects. The maximal Lyapunov exponent estimates the degree
of resilience of gait control to small perturbations, i.e. the local dynamic
stability (LDS). The objective of the present study was to assess to what
extent RAC influences gait LDS, and to compare this effect with that on scaling
exponents. Twenty healthy subjects performed 6x5min walking trials on an
instrumented treadmill at three different speeds. Freely chosen walking
cadences were measured during the first three trials and then imposed
accordingly in the last three trials with a metronome. The 2D trajectory of the
center of pressure on the treadmill was recorded. From the antero-posterior and
the medio-lateral signals, both long-term and short-term LDS were computed.
Long-term LDS was strongly enhanced (relative change +47%), with significant
change in every direction and speed. The average change in short-term LDS was
smaller (+3%), with a more marked effect at low speed (+5%). RAC substantially
modified the fluctuation dynamics of the center of the pressure trajectory. We
also observed that both LDS and fractal dynamics (scaling exponents) responded
similarly to RAC. Thus, both scaling exponents and LDS are responsive to
sensory-motor synchronizing processes that RAC activates, and may constitute
relevant indexes for evaluating gait variability in cued walking. Finally, the
more locally stable gait pattern could be an indication of a lower fall risk,
which may be an advantage to patients of RAC therapies.

for the sources of Galactic cosmic rays. According to the diffusive shock
acceleration theory, SNR shocks produce a power-law spectrum with an index of s
= 2, perhaps nonlinearly modified to harder spectra at high energy.
Observations of SNRs often indicate particle spectra that are softer than that
and show features not expected from classical theory. Known drawbacks of the
standard approach are the assumption that SNRs evolve in a uniform environment,
and that the reverse shock does not accelerate particles. Relaxing these
assumptions increases the complexity of the problem, because one needs reliable
hydrodynamical data for the plasma flow as well as good estimates for the
magnetic field (MF) at the reverse shock. Aims. We show that these two factors
are especially important when modeling young core-collapse SNRs that evolve in
a complicated circumstellar medium shaped by the winds of progenitor stars.
Methods. We used high-resolution numerical simulations for the hydrodynamical
evolution of the SNR. Instead of parametrizations of the MF profiles inside the
SNR, we followed the advection of the frozen-in MF inside the SNR, and thus
obtained the B-field value at all locations, in particular at the reverse
shock. To model cosmic-ray acceleration we solved the cosmic-ray transport
equation in test-particle approximation. Results. We find that the complex
plasma-flow profiles of core-collapse SNRs significantly modify the particle
spectra. Additionally, the reverse shock strongly affects the emission spectra
and the surface brightness.

features. A detailed study of the morphology of those features has been carried
out using Hubble Space Telescope archival images. NGC 4921 shows a few but
well-defined dust arms midway to its centre while NGC 7049 displays many more
dusty features, mainly collected within a ring-shaped formation. Numerous dark
and filamentary structures, called outgrowths, are found to protrude from the
dusty arms in both galaxies. The outgrowths point both outwards and inwards in
the galaxies. Mostly they are found to be V-shaped or Y-shaped with the
branches connected to dark arm filaments. Often the stem of the Y appears to
consist of intertwined filaments. Remarkably, the outgrowths show considerable
similarities to elephant trunks in H II regions. A model of the outgrowths,
based on magnetized filaments, is proposed. The model provides explanations of
both the shapes and orientations of the outgrowths. Most important, it can also
give an account for their intertwined structures. It is found that the longest
outgrowths are confusingly similar to dusty spiral arms. This suggests that
some of the outgrowths can develop into such arms. The time-scale of the
development is estimated to be on the order of the rotation period of the arms
or shorter. Similar processes may also take place in other spiral galaxies. If
so, the model of the outgrowths can offer a new approach to the old winding
problem of spiral arms.

time t is a random compact subset of T^d. We study the geometric properties of
the complement T^d \ W[0,t] for t large and d >= 3. In particular, we show that
the largest regions in this complement have a linear scale phi = [(d log
t)/(d-2)kt]^{1/(d-2)}, where k is the capacity of the unit ball. More
specifically, we identify the sets E for which T^d \ W[0,t] contains a
translate of phi E, and we count the number of disjoint such translates.
Furthermore, we derive large deviation principles for the largest inradius of
T^d \ W[0,t] for t large and the epsilon-cover time of T^d for epsilon small.
Our results, which generalise laws of large numbers proved by Dembo, Peres and
Rosen, are based on a large deviation principle for the shape of the component
with largest capacity in T^d \ W_rho[0,t], where W_rho[0,t] is the Wiener
sausage of radius rho = rho(t), with rho(t) chosen much smaller than phi but
not too small. The idea behind this choice is that T^d \ W[0,t] consists of
""lakes"", whose linear size is of order phi, connected by narrow ""channels"". We
also derive large deviation principles for the principal Dirichlet eigenvalue
and for the maximal volume of the components of T^d \ W_rho[0,t] for t large.
Our results give a complete picture of the extremal geometry of T^d \ W[0,t]
and of the optimal strategy for W[0,t] to realise the extremes.

Here we show that heat superconductivity is indeed possible. We will show how
the possibility of the heat superconductivity emerges in theory, and how the
heat superconductor can be constructed using recently proposed time crystals.
The underlying simple physics is also illustrated. If the possibility could be

  (ICML) 2012 Workshop on Representation Learning",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many machine learning tasks can be expressed as the transformation---or
\emph{transduction}---of input sequences into output sequences: speech
recognition, machine translation, protein secondary structure prediction and
text-to-speech to name but a few. One of the key challenges in sequence
transduction is learning to represent both the input and output sequences in a
way that is invariant to sequential distortions such as shrinking, stretching
and translating. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a powerful sequence
learning architecture that has proven capable of learning such representations.
However RNNs traditionally require a pre-defined alignment between the input
and output sequences to perform transduction. This is a severe limitation since
\emph{finding} the alignment is the most difficult aspect of many sequence
transduction problems. Indeed, even determining the length of the output
sequence is often challenging. This paper introduces an end-to-end,
probabilistic sequence transduction system, based entirely on RNNs, that is in
principle able to transform any input sequence into any finite, discrete output
sequence. Experimental results for phoneme recognition are provided on the
TIMIT speech corpus.

from an average theta series. There, in addition to all the multiplicities, the
lengths of part of lattice vectors cannot be obtained owing to systematic
absences. As a consequence, solutions are not always unique. We develop a new
algorithm to enumerate powder auto-indexing solutions. This is a novel
application of the reduction theory of positive-definite quadratic forms to a
problem of crystallography. Our algorithm is proved to be effective for all
types of systematic absences, using their newly obtained common properties. The
properties are stated as distribution rules for lattice vectors corresponding
to systematic absences on a topograph. Conway defined topographs for
2-dimensional lattices as graphs whose edges are associated with $|l_1|^2$,
$|l_2|^2$, $|l_1+l_2|^2$, $|l_1-l_2|^2$. In our enumeration algorithm,
topographs are utilized as a network of lattice vector lengths. As a crystal
structure is a lattice of rank 3, the definition of topographs is generalized
to any higher dimensional lattices using Voronoi's second reduction theory. The
use of topographs allows us to speed up the algorithm. The computation time is
reduced to 1/250--1/32, when it is applied to real powder diffraction patterns.
Another advantage of our algorithm is its robustness to missing or false
elements in the set of lengths extracted from a powder diffraction pattern.
Conograph is the powder indexing software which implements the algorithm. We
present results of Conograph for 30 diffraction patterns, including some very
difficult cases.
