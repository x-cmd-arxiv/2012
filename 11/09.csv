evolution of Population III (Pop III) stellar systems in a range of host
minihalo environments. A Pop III multiple system forms in each of the ten
minihaloes, and the overall mass function is top-heavy compared to the
currently observed initial mass function in the Milky Way. Using a sink
particle to represent each growing protostar, we examine the binary
characteristics of the multiple systems, resolving orbits on scales as small as
20 AU. We find a binary fraction of ~36%, with semi-major axes as large as 3000
AU. The distribution of orbital periods is slightly peaked at < 900 yr, while
the distribution of mass ratios is relatively flat. Of all sink particles
formed within the ten minihaloes, ~50% are lost to mergers with larger sinks,
and ~50% of the remaining sinks are ejected from their star-forming disks. The
large binary fraction may have important implications for Pop III evolution and
nucleosynthesis, as well as the final fate of the first stars.

this, we perform a global analysis of Q-ball formation and decay in
Affleck-Dine baryogenesis for a d = 6 (u^{c}d^{c}d^{c})^2 flat direction of the
gauge-mediated MSSM. A general phenomenological potential for the
flat-direction is studied and the Q-ball decay properties are obtained as a
function of its parameters. The corresponding gravitino mass necessary to
account for dark matter is then determined for the case of stau NLSPs. The
decay temperature depends on the charge of the Q-balls, which is determined by
the fragmentation of the AD condensate. Different fragmentation scenarios are
considered, and the final non-thermal NLSP density from Q-ball decay and NLSP
annihilation is determined. Particular care is taken to establish that NLSPs
from Q-ball decay become homogeneous and non-relativistic prior to
annihilation. The gravitino mass necessary for dark matter is naturally
consistent with the theoretical gravitino mass in the gauge-mediation model.

flavour and CP violation as well as right-handed currents is the addition of a
U(1) gauge symmetry to the SM gauge group. If the corresponding heavy gauge
boson Z' mediates FCNC processes in the quark sector at tree-level, these new
physics contributions imply a pattern of deviations from SM expectations for
FCNC processes depending only on Z' couplings to fermions and on its mass. This
implies stringent correlations between Delta F=2 and Delta F=1 observables
which govern the landscape of the allowed parameter space for Z'-models.
Anticipating the Flavour Precision Era (FPE) ahead of us we illustrate this by
searching for allowed oases in this landscape assuming significantly smaller
uncertainties in CKM and hadronic parameters than presently available. To this
end we analyze Delta F=2 observables in K^0-bar K^0 and B^0_{s,d}-bar B^0_{s,d}
systems and rare K and B decays including both left-handed and right-handed
Z'-couplings to quarks in various combinations. We identify a number of
correlations between various flavour observables that could test and
distinguish these different Z' scenarios. The important role of b->s l^+ l^-
and b->s nu bar nu transitions in these studies is emphasized. Imposing the
existing flavour constraints, a rich pattern of deviations from the SM
expectations in B_{s,d} and K meson systems emerges provided M_Z'<3 TeV. While
for M_Z'>5 TeV Z' effects in rare B_{s,d} decays are found typically below 10%
and hard to measure even in the FPE, K->pi nu bar nu and K_L-> pi^0 l^+ l^-
decays provide an important portal to scales beyond those explored by the LHC.
We apply our formalism to NP scenarios with induced flavour changing neutral
Z-couplings to quarks. We find that in the case of B_d and K decays, but not
B_s decays, such Z-couplings still allow for sizable departures from the SM.

large fraction of the thermal pressure, which effects the nature of the
termination shock, and they are a dominate component of pressure in the
heliosheath. This paper describes the development of a new multi-ion,
multi-fluid 3-D magnetohydrodynamic model of the outer heliosphere. This model
has the added capability of tracking the individual fluid properties of
multiple ion populations. For this initial study two ion populations are
modeled: the thermal solar wind ions and PUIs produced in the supersonic solar
wind. The model also includes 4 neutral fluids that interact through
charge-exchange with the ion fluids. The new multi-ion simulation reproduces
the significant heating of PUIs at the termination shock, as inferred from
Voyager observations, and provides properties of PUIs in the 3-D heliosheath.
The thinning of the heliosheath due to the loss of thermal energy in the
heliosheath from PUI and neutral interaction is also quantified. In future work
the multi-ion, multi-fluid model will be used to simulate energetic neutral

events with two isolated photons in the final state, in proton-proton
collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV. The full data set collected in 2011,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4.9 fb-1, is used. The amount of
background, from hadronic jets and isolated electrons, is estimated with
data-driven techniques and subtracted. The total cross section, for two
isolated photons with transverse energies above 25 GeV and 22 GeV respectively,
in the acceptance of the electromagnetic calorimeter (|eta|<1.37 and
1.52<|eta|<2.37) and with an angular separation Delta R>0.4, is 44.0 (+3.2)
(-4.2) pb. The differential cross sections as a function of the di-photon
invariant mass, transverse momentum, azimuthal separation, and cosine of the
polar angle of the largest transverse energy photon in the Collins--Soper
di-photon rest frame are also measured. The results are compared to the
prediction of leading-order parton-shower and next-to-leading-order and
next-to-next-to-leading-order parton-level generators.

classical and quantum gravity, is an in depth investigation of causality in
classical field theories with quasilinear equations of motion, of which General
Relativity is a prominent example. Several modern geometric tools (jet bundle
formulation of partial differential equations (PDEs), the theory of symmetric
hyperbolic PDE systems, covariant constructions of symplectic and Poisson
structures) and applies them to the construction of the phase space and the
algebra of observables of quasilinear classical field theories. This
construction is shown to be diffeomorphism covariant (using auxiliary
background fields if necessary) using categorical tools in a strong parallel
with the locally covariant field theory (LCFT) formulation of quantum field
theory (QFT) on curved spacetimes. In this context, generalized versions of
LCFT axioms become theorems of classical field theory, which includes a
generalized Causality property. Considering deformation quantization as the
connection to QFT, a plausible conjecture is made about the Causal structure of
quantum gravity. In the process, conal manifolds are identified as the
generalization of the causal structure of Lorentzian geometry to quasilinear
PDEs. Several important concepts and results are generalized from Lorentzian to
conal geometry. Also, the proof of compatibility of the Peierls formula for
Poisson brackets and the covariant phase space symplectic structure for
hyperbolic systems is generalized to now encompass systems with constraints and
gauge invariance.

that denial of experimenters' free will may be the only workable solutions. If
the free will assumption is rejected, then a door is open that may ultimately
reconcile quantum mechanics with the definiteness of individual experiments. A

systems from a purely dynamical perspective, namely, through the statistical
behavior of quantum jump trajectories. This approach goes beyond considering
only properties of the steady state. While in small quantum systems dynamical
transitions can only occur trivially at limiting values of the controlling
parameters, in many-body systems they arise as collective phenomena and within
this perspective they are reminiscent of thermodynamic phase transitions. We
illustrate this in open models of increasing complexity: a three-level system,
a dissipative version of the quantum Ising model, and the micromaser. In these
examples dynamical transitions are accompanied by clear changes in static
behavior. This is however not always the case, and in general dynamical phase
behavior needs to be uncovered by observables which are strictly dynamical,
e.g. dynamical counting fields. We demonstrate this via the example of a class
of models of dissipative quantum glasses, whose dynamics can vary widely
despite having identical (and trivial) stationary states.

has increased dramatically in financial markets over the last decade. In the US
and Europe, it now accounts for nearly one-half of all trades. Although
evidence suggests that HFT contributes to the efficiency of markets, there are
concerns it also adds to market instability, especially during times of stress.
Currently, it is unclear how or why HFT produces these outcomes. In this paper,
I use data from NASDAQ to show that HFT synchronizes prices in financial
markets, making the values of related securities change contemporaneously. With
a model, I demonstrate how price synchronization leads to increased efficiency:
prices are more accurate and transaction costs are reduced. During times of
stress, however, localized errors quickly propagate through the financial
system if safeguards are not in place. In addition, there is potential for HFT
to enforce incorrect relationships between securities, making prices more (or
less) correlated than economic fundamentals warrant. This research highlights
an important role that HFT plays in markets and helps answer several puzzling
questions that previously seemed difficult to explain: why HFT is so prevalent,
why HFT concentrates in certain securities and largely ignores others, and
finally, how HFT can lower transaction costs yet still make profits.

peculiarities of IX Dra as well as other active cataclysmic variables, in
particular dwarf novae of the ER Uma-type. In order to measure fundamental
parameters of the system, we carried out analyses of the light curve, O-C
diagram, and power spectra. During over two months of observations we detected
two superoutbursts and several normal outbursts. The V magnitude of the star
varied in the range 14.6 - 18.2 mag. Superoutbursts occur regularly with the
supercycle length of 58.5+/-0.5 d. When analysing data over the past 20 years,
we found that the supercycle length is increasing at a rate of P_dot = 1.8 *
10^{-3}. Normal outbursts appear to be irregular, with typical occurrence times
in the range 3.1 - 4.1 d. We detected a double-peaked structure of superhumps
during superoutburst, with the secondary maximum becoming dominant near the end
of the superoutburst. The mean superhump period observed during superoutbursts
equals 0.066982(36) d, which is constant over the last two decades of
observations. Based on the power spectrum analysis, the evaluation of the
orbital period was problematic. We found two possible values: the first one,
0.06641(3) d, which is in agreement with previous studies and our O-C analysis
(0.06646(2) d), and the second one, 0.06482(3) d, which is less likely. The
evolutionary status of the object depends dramatically on the choice between
these two values. A spectroscopic determination of the orbital period is
needed. We updated available information on ER UMa-type stars and present a new
set of their basic statistics. Thereby, we provide evidence that this class of

  Workshop on the Dark Side of the Universe, June 2012, Buzios, Brasil",,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  One of the biggest mysteries in cosmology is Dark Energy, which is required
to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe within the standard model.
But maybe one can explain the observations without introducing new physics, by
simply taking one step back and re-examining one of the basic concepts of
cosmology, homogeneity. In standard cosmology, it is assumed that the universe
is homogeneous, but this is not true at small scales (<200 Mpc). Since general
relativity, which is the basis of modern cosmology, is a non-linear theory, one
can expect some backreactions in the case of an inhomogeneous matter
distribution. Estimates of the magnitude of these backreactions (feedback)
range from insignificant to being perfectly able to explain the accelerated
expansion of the universe. In the end, the only way to be sure is to test
predictions of inhomogeneous cosmological theories, such as timescape
cosmology, against observational data. If these theories provide a valid
description of the universe, one expects aside other effects, that there is a
dependence of the Hubble parameter on the line of sight matter distribution.
The redshift of a galaxy, which is located at a certain distance, is expected
to be smaller if the environment in the line of sight is mainly high density
(clusters), rather than mainly low density environment (voids). Here we present
a test for this prediction using redshifts and fundamental plane distances of
elliptical galaxies obtained from SDSS DR8 data. In order to get solid
statistics, which can handle the uncertainties in the distance estimate and the
natural scatter due to peculiar motions, one has to systematically study a very
large number of galaxies. Therefore, the SDSS forms a perfect basis for testing
timescape cosmology and similar theories. The preliminary results of this
cosmological test are shown in this contribution.

failure of perturbation theory at these energies. The higher-energy polaron
states have a finite lifetime. We study this lifetime and the disorder-induced
energy shift of these eigenstates for various strengths of disorder and
electron-phonon coupling. We compare our findings to the predictions of Fermi's
golden rule and the average T-matrix method, and find a significant

shocks, to suffer from these shocks as little as possible, for the shortest

the perturbation. We propose an operation definition of resilience, seeing it
as a measure of stress that is complementary to the risk measures. Emphasis is
put on the distinction between stressors (the forces acting on the system) and
stress (the internal reaction of the system to the stressors). This allows us
to elaborate a classification of stress measures and of the possible responses
to stressors. We emphasize the need for characterizing the goals of a given
system, from which the process of resilience build-up can be defined.
Distinguishing between exogenous versus endogenous sources of stress allows one
to define the corresponding appropriate responses. The main ingredients towards
resilience include (1) the need for continuous multi-variable measurement and
diagnosis of endogenous instabilities, (2) diversification and heterogeneity,
(3) decoupling, (4) incentives and motivations, and (5) last but not least the
(obvious) role of individual strengths. Propositions for individual training
towards resilience are articulated. The concept of ""crisis flight simulators""
is introduced to address the intrinsic human cognitive biases underlying the
logic of failures and the illusion of control. We also introduce the
""time-at-risk"" framework, whose goal is to provide continuous predictive
updates on possible scenarios and their probabilistic weights, so that a
culture of preparedness and adaptation be promoted. These concepts are

While not statistically significant at present, the results show some
interesting patterns of deviations from the SM predictions, in particular a
higher rate in the \gamma\gamma\ decay mode observed by ATLAS and CMS, and a
somewhat smaller rate in the \tau\tau\ mode. The LHC discovery is also

electromagnetic waveguide subject to gaussian noise. Here we present an exactly
solvable model of communications with a fully quantum electromagnetic field.
This allows us to find explicit expressions for all the point-to-point
capacities of a noisy quantum channel, with implications for quantum key
distribution, and fiber optical communications. We also develop a theory of
quantum communication networks by solving some rudimentary quantum networks for
broadcasting and multiple access. When possible, we compare the predictions of
our new model with those of the orthodox quantum gaussian model and in all
cases we find capacities in agreement to within a constant number of bits.
Thus, in the limit of high signal to noise ratios our simple model captures the

Lasserre, and Parrilo shows that this proof system is automatizable using
semidefinite programming (SDP), meaning that any $n$-variable degree-$d$ proof

Lasserre SDP hierarchy, meaning that the ""$d/2$-round Lasserre value"" of an
optimization problem is equal to the best bound provable using a degree-$d$ SOS

Max-Cut integrality gap instances can have their optimum value certified by an

in a large class of $E_6$ inspired models lead to distinctive signatures from
gluino cascade decays in comparison to those from the Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model (MSSM). These signatures involve longer decay chains, more
visible transverse energy, higher multiplicities of jets and leptons, and less
missing transverse energy than in the MSSM. These features make the gluino
harder to discover for certain types of conventional analyses, for example in
the 6 jet channel we show that a 1 TeV MSSM gluino may resemble an 800 GeV
$E_6$ gluino. However, the enriched lepton multiplicity provides enhanced 3-
and 4-lepton signatures, which are much more suppressed in the case of the
MSSM. As an example we analyse various scenarios in the E$_6$SSM, demonstrating
the utility of a \texttt{CalcHEP} model that we have now made publicly
available on HEPMDB (High Energy Physics Models DataBase). After extensive
scans over the parameter space, we focus on representative benchmark points. We
perform detailed Monte Carlo analyses, concentrating on the 3-lepton channel at

inspired models are clearly distinguishable from the MSSM in gluino cascade
decays. We emphasise to the LHC experimental groups that the distinctive
features present in gluino cascade decays, such as those discussed here, not
only represents a unique footprint of a particular model but also may provide
the key to an earlier discovery of supersymmetry.

to choose how much to offer and how little to accept are sufficiently
fine-grained. Small sets of discrete strategies lead to the stable coexistence
of the two most rational strategies in the set, while larger sets lead to the
dominance of a single yet not necessarily the fairest strategy. The fairest

found through transit searches. Radial velocity surveys have also revealed
several Jupiter-mass planets with highly eccentric orbits. Measurements of the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect indicate some misaligned planetary systems. This
diversity could be induced by post-formation dynamical processes such as
planet-planet scattering, the Kozai effect, or secular chaos which brings
planets to the vicinity of their host stars. In this work, we propose a novel
mechanism to form close-in super-Earths and Neptune-like planets through the
tidal disruption of giant planets as a consequence of these dynamical
processes. We model the core-envelope structure of giant planets with composite
polytropes. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of close
encounters between planets and their host stars, we find that the presence of a
core with a mass more than ten Earth masses can significantly increase the
fraction of envelope which remains bound to it. After the encounter, planets
with cores are more likely to be retained by their host stars in contrast with
previous studies which suggested that coreless planets are often ejected. As a
substantial fraction of their gaseous envelopes is preferentially lost while
the dense incompressible cores retain most of their original mass, the
resulting metallicity of the surviving planets is increased. Our results
suggest that some gas giant planets can be effectively transformed into either
super-Earths or Neptune-like planets after multiple close stellar passages.
Finally, we analyze the orbits and structure of known planets and Kepler
candidates and find that our model is capable producing some of the

of generating PeV neutrinos at the level implied by IceCube's two events. In
contrast, the radiation fields in typical active galactic nuclei models are
likely dominated by lower energy (UV) photons, and thus feature higher energy
thresholds for pion production, leading to neutrino spectra which peak at EeV
rather than PeV energies (models with significant densities of x-ray emission,
however, could evade this problem). Cosmogenic neutrinos generated from the
propagation of ultra-high energy cosmic rays similarly peak at energies that
are much higher than those of the events reported by IceCube.

satellite systems beyond the Local Group. We find that the luminosity functions
of our simulations compare well to observations when the luminosity functions
are scaled according to host mass. We use the recently-found relationship
between dwarf satellites and host mass in distant satellite systems (Trentham &
Tully 2009) to normalize a theoretical, complete luminosity function for the
Milky Way (Koposov et al. 2008). The luminosity function of satellites,
expressed as a function of the host mass, is given by dN/dM_V= 3.5 x
M_host^(0.91) x 10^(0.1 x M_V-10.2), where host mass is given in M_sun. The
mass of a host galaxy can be used to predict the number of dwarf satellites and
even when considering spiral and elliptical hosts separately this relation
holds.

mergers and it perfectly matches with merger rate predictions by

the halo of local galaxies such as M31 or NGC5907 are likely caused by major
merger relics. This suggests that the hierarchical scenario has played a major
role in shaping the massive galaxies of the Hubble sequence. Linking galaxy
properties at different epochs is the best way to fully understand galaxy
formation processes and we have tested such a link through generated series of

approximately equal to the dopant impurity density, the density dependent
transport shows qualitatively different behavior from that of the well-studied

We find that the density dependent mobility of the Si:P system shows
non-monotonic behavior which is exactly opposite of the non-monotonicity
observed in Si-MOSFETs --- in the Si:P system the mobility first decreases with
increasing density and then it increases slowly with increasing density above a
typical density $10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ (in contrast to Si MOSFETs where the
mobility typically increases with density first and then slowly decreases at
high density as surface roughness scattering dominates). In the low density
limit (or strong screening limit) mobility decreases inversely with increasing
density, but in the high density limit (or weak screening limit) it slowly
increases due to the finite width effects of the 2D layer. In the intermediate
density regime ($1/a < 2 k_F < q_{TF}$, where $a$, $k_F$, and $q_{TF}$ are the
confinement width of the $\delta$-layer, Fermi wave vector, and Thomas-Fermi
screening wave vector, respectively) the density dependent mobility is
approximately a constant at the minimum value. However, the calculated mean
free path increase monotonically with density. We also compare the transport
scattering time relevant to the mobility and the single particle relaxation
time relevant the quantum level broadening, finding that the transport
scattering time could be much larger than the single-particle scattering time

solving the initial-value problem for a particular sequence of initial data.
The sequence of data is generated by adding an asymptotically vanishing
sequence of perturbations to pure Gaussian initial data. These perturbations
are obtained by applying the inverse-scattering transform to formal WKB
approximations of eigenvalues of the associated spectral problem with a
Gaussian potential. Recent results [Lee, Lyng, & Vankova, Physica D 24

as they are with the integrable structure of the equation---do not excite the
acute modulational instabilities that are known to be present in the
semiclassical regime. Here, we provide additional evidence to support the claim
that these WKB-induced perturbations indeed have a very special structure. In
particular, as a control experiment, we examine the evolution from a family of
initial data created by an asymptotically vanishing family of analytic
perturbations which are qualitatively indistinguishable from the WKB-induced
perturbations that generate the Gaussian semiclassical soliton ensemble. We
then compare this evolution to the (numerically computed) true evolution of the
Gaussian and also to the evolution of the corresponding members of the
semiclassical soliton ensemble. Our results both highlight the exceptional

to the hypokinetic motor symptoms of the disorder. Our study explores potential
mechanisms behind this intermittent synchrony. We study the response of a
bursting pallidal neuron to different patterns of synaptic input from
subthalamic nucleus (STN) neuron. We show how external globus pallidus (GPe)
neuron is sensitive to the phase of the input from the STN cell and can exhibit
intermittent phase-locking with the input in the beta band. The temporal
properties of this intermittent phase-locking show similarities to the
intermittent synchronization observed in experiments. We also study the
synchronization of GPe cells to synaptic input from the STN cell with
dependence on the dopamine-modulated parameters. Dopamine also affects the
cellular properties of neurons. We show how the changes in firing patterns of
STN neuron due to the lack of dopamine may lead to transition from a lower to a
higher coherent state, roughly matching the synchrony levels observed in basal
ganglia in normal and parkinsonian states. The intermittent nature of the
neural beta band synchrony in Parkinson's disease is achieved in the model due
to the interplay of the timing of STN input to pallidum and pallidal neuronal
dynamics, resulting in sensitivity of pallidal output to the phase of the
arriving STN input. Thus the mechanism considered here (the change in firing
pattern of subthalamic neurons through the dopamine-induced change of membrane
properties) may be one of the potential mechanisms responsible for the
generation of the intermittent synchronization observed in Parkinson's disease.

`pair-instability' or `pulsational pair-instability' supernovae with estimated

exceedingly rare at low redshift, but are expected to be more common at high

skewed to high values. Here we report the detection of two super-luminous

a new emergent phase of two-dimensional Fermi gases. We show that when some

helical Fermi surfaces to become significantly `nested', a Fermi surface
instability arises. To lift this degeneracy, a spontaneous symmetry breaking
spin-orbit density wave develops, causing a surprisingly large quasiparticle
gapping with chiral electronic states. Since the staggered spin-orbit order is
associated with a condensation energy, quantified by the gap value, destroying
such spin-orbit interaction costs sufficiently large perturbation field or
temperature or de-phasing time. BiAg$_2$ surface state is shown to be a
representative system for realizing such novel spin-orbit interaction with
tunable and large strength, and the spin-splitting is decoupled from charge
excitations. These functional properties are relevant for spin-electronics,
spin-caloritronics, and spin-Hall effect applications.

PT-RGI. These are also gauge- and process-independent, show dimensional
transmutation, and are the natural ingredients of skeleton expansions of

Green's functions are IR-finite. Next we show from the ghost-free Ward
identities of the PT how the conventional running charge is recovered from the
full PT-RGI three-gluon vertex, which depends on three momenta. The usual
running charge, depending on only one momentum, is not necessarily a good
substitute for this PT-RGI three-gluon vertex. We show that at one dressed loop
a good approximation to the full dressed loop PT-RGI three-gluon vertex, both
in the UV and in the IR, comes from input propagators and vertices that are
free, except that the propagator is modified by introducing a (constant) mass
term. Finally,we illustrate these ideas in the much simpler context of a scalar
theory with cubic interactions in d=6, which is asymptotically free.

subset $I$ of $S$ is an island if there exits a convex set $C$ such that
$I=C\cap S$. The discrepancy of an island is the absolute value of the number
of red minus the number of blue points it contains. A convex partition of $S$
is a partition of $S$ into islands with pairwise disjoint convex hulls. The
discrepancy of a convex partition is the discrepancy of its island of minimum
discrepancy. The coarseness of $S$ is the discrepancy of the convex partition
of $S$ with maximum discrepancy. This concept was recently defined by Bereg et

of $n$ points in general position in the plane, how to color each of them (red
or blue) such that the resulting 2-colored point set has small coarseness? We
prove that every $n$-point set $S$ can be colored such that its coarseness is
$O(n^{1/4}\sqrt{\log n})$. This bound is almost tight since there exist
$n$-point sets such that every 2-coloring gives coarseness at least

limits on the presence of magnetic fields. In twenty-six sources, it was
possible to place upper limits on the magnitude of magnetic fields, typically

clients by duplicating the data packets at the closest possible point to the
clients. This way at most only one data packets travels down a network link at
any one time irrespective of how many clients receive this packet.
Traditionally multicasting has been implemented over a specialized network
built using multicast routers. This kind of network has the drawback of
requiring the deployment of special routers that are more expensive than
ordinary routers. Recently there is new interest in delivering multicast
traffic over application layer overlay networks. Application layer overlay
networks though built on top of the physical network, behave like an
independent virtual network made up of only logical links between the nodes.
Several authors have proposed systems, mechanisms and protocols for the
implementation of multicast media streaming over overlay networks. In this

existence of low-mass and weakly coupling fields in the universe. The
quasi-parallel photon-photon collision system (QPS) can provide chances to
probe the resonant production of these light dark fields and the induced decay
by the coherent nature of laser fields simultaneously. By focusing
high-intensity lasers with different colors in the vacuum, new colors emerge as
the signature of the interaction. Because four photons in the initial and final
states interplay via the dark field exchange, this process is analogous to
four-wave mixing in quantum optics, where the frequency sum and difference
among the incident three waves generate the fourth wave with a new frequency
via the nonlinear property of crystals. The interaction rate of the four-wave
mixing process has the cubic dependence on the intensity of each wave.
Therefore, if high-intensity laser fields are given, the sensitivity to the
weakly coupling of dark fields to photons rapidly increases over the wide mass
range below sub-eV. Based on the experimentally measurable photon energies and
the linear polarization states, we formulate the relation between the
accessible mass-coupling domains and the high-intensity laser parameters, where
the effects of the finite spectrum width of pulse lasers are taken into
account. The expected sensitivity suggests that we have a potential to explore
interactions at the Super-Planckian coupling strength in the sub-eV mass range,
if the cutting-edge laser technologies are properly combined.

OSWs at the interface can propagate at an arbitrary angle with respect to them.
The electromagnetic field of the OSWs in a layered superconductor is a
superposition of an ordinary wave (with its electric field parallel to the
layers) and an extraordinary wave (with its magnetic field parallel to the
layers). We have derived the dispersion equation for the OSWs and shown that
the dispersion curves have end-points where the extraordinary mode transforms
from evanescent wave to bulk wave, propagating deep into the superconductor. In
addition, we have analytically solved the problem of the resonance excitation
of the OSWs by the attenuated-total-reflection method using an additional
dielectric prism. Due to the strong current anisotropy in the boundary of the
superconductor, the excitation of the OSWs is accompanied by an additional
important phenomenon: the electromagnetic field component with the orthogonal
polarization appears in the wave reflected from the bottom of the prism. We
show that, for definite optimal combinations of the problem parameters (the
wave frequency, the direction of the incident wave vector, the thickness of the
gap between dielectric prism and superconductor, etc.), there is a complete
suppression of the reflected wave with its polarization coinciding with the
polarization of the incident wave. Contrary to the isotropic case, this
phenomenon can be observed even in the dissipationless limit. In such a regime,
the complete transformation of the incident wave into a reflected wave with
orthogonal polarization can be observed.

e-commerce and peer-to-peer networks. In these applications, users can generate
local opinions about the counterparts based on direct experiences, and these
opinions can then be aggregated to build trust among unknown users. The
mechanism to build new trust relationships based on existing ones is referred
to as trust inference. State-of-the-art trust inference approaches employ the
transitivity property of trust by propagating trust along connected users. In
this paper, we propose a novel trust inference model (MaTrust) by exploring an
equally important property of trust, i.e., the multi-aspect property. MaTrust
directly characterizes multiple latent factors for each trustor and trustee
from the locally-generated trust relationships. Furthermore, it can naturally
incorporate prior knowledge as specified factors. These factors in turn serve
as the basis to infer the unseen trustworthiness scores. Experimental
evaluations on real data sets show that the proposed MaTrust significantly

that scalar field is the dominating matter component. In case of Tachyonic

invaluable information about population demography and fine-scale correlations
along the genome, thus empowering both population genomic and medical
association studies. Yet phasing unrelated individuals remains a challenging
problem. Incorporating available data from high throughput sequencing into
traditional statistical phasing approaches is a promising avenue to alleviate
these issues. We present a novel statistical method that expands on an existing
graphical haplotype reconstruction method (shapeIT) to incorporate phasing
information from paired-end read data. The algorithm harnesses the haplotype
graph information estimated by shapeIT from genotypes across the population and
refines haplotype likelihoods for a given individual to be compatible with the
sequencing data. Applying the method to HapMap individuals genotyped on the
Affymetrix Axiom chip at 7,745,081 SNPs and on a trio sequenced by Complete
Genomics, we found that the inclusion of paired end read data significantly
improved phasing, with reductions in switch error on the order of 4-15% against
shapeIT across all panels. As expected, the improvements were found to be most
significant at sites harboring rare variants; furthermore, we found that longer
read sizes and higher throughput translated to greater decreases in switching
error, as did higher variance in the size of the insert separating the two
reads--suggesting that multi-platform next generation sequencing may be
exploited to yield particularly accurate haplotypes. Overall, the phasing
improvements afforded by this new method highlight the power of integrating
sequencing read information and population genotype data for reconstructing
haplotypes in unrelated individuals.

quadrimodality could be explained by the superposition of two `normal' bimodal

tentatively explore the relationship between our CN populations and a range of
elemental abundances. We found a striking correlation between CN and [O/Na]. We
also found that the four CN peaks may be paired -- the two CN-weaker
populations being associated with low Ba and the two CN-stronger populations
with high Ba. If true then s-process abundances would be a good diagnostic for
disentangling the two original clusters in the merger scenario. More

impurity solver, the three-band Hubbard model with full Hund's rule coupling
and spin-orbit interaction terms, which contains the essential physics of
partially filled $t_{2g}$ sub-shell of $5d$ materials, is studied
systematically. The calculated phase diagram of this model exhibits three
distinct phase regions, including metal, band insulator and Mott insulator

enhance the tendency of the Mott insulator phase. Furthermore, the influence of
the electron-electron interaction on the effective strength of spin-orbit

  Methods",,,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Singular value decomposition is the key tool in the analysis and
understanding of linear regularization methods. In the last decade nonlinear
variational approaches such as $\ell^1$ or total variation regularizations
became quite prominent regularization techniques with certain properties being
superior to standard methods. In the analysis of those, singular values and
vectors did not play any role so far, for the obvious reason that these
problems are nonlinear, together with the issue of defining singular values and
singular vectors. In this paper however we want to start a study of singular
values and vectors for nonlinear variational regularization of linear inverse
problems, with particular focus on singular one-homogeneous regularization
functionals. A major role is played by the smallest singular value, which we
define as the ground state of an appropriate functional combining the
(semi-)norm introduced by the forward operator and the regularization
functional. The optimality condition for the ground state further yields a
natural generalization to higher singular values and vectors involving the
subdifferential of the regularization functional. We carry over two main
properties from the world of linear regularization. The first one is gaining
information about scale, respectively the behavior of regularization techniques
at different scales. This also leads to novel estimates at different scales,
generalizing the estimates for the coefficients in the linear singular value
expansion. The second one is to provide exact solutions for variational
regularization methods. We will show that all singular vectors can be
reconstructed up to a scalar factor by the standard Tikhonov-type
regularization approach even in the presence of (small) noise. Moreover, we
will show that they can even be reconstructed without any bias by the recently
popularized inverse scale space method.

to the different bulk Lorentz factor Gamma and jet aperture angle theta_jet. We
investigated, through a population synthesis code, what are the distributions
of Gamma and theta_jet compatible with the observations. Both quantities must
have preferred values, with log-normal best fitting distributions and <Gamma0>

narrower the jet angle, the larger the bulk Lorentz factor. We predict that ~6%

optimize the system sum rate over the resource sharing of both D2D and cellular
modes, we introduce a reverse iterative combinatorial auction as the allocation
mechanism. In the auction, all the spectrum resources are considered as a set
of resource units, which as bidders compete to obtain business while the
packages of the D2D pairs are auctioned off as goods in each auction round. We
first formulate the valuation of each resource unit, as a basis of the proposed
auction. And then a detailed non-monotonic descending price auction algorithm
is explained depending on the utility function that accounts for the channel
gain from D2D and the costs for the system. Further, we prove that the proposed
auction-based scheme is cheat-proof, and converges in a finite number of
iteration rounds. We explain non-monotonicity in the price update process and
show lower complexity compared to a traditional combinatorial allocation. The
simulation results demonstrate that the algorithm efficiently leads to a good
performance on the system sum rate.

and subject to asymmetric non-Gaussian $\alpha$-stableL\'evy noise, is
explored. The lifetime of a tumor staying in the range between the tumor-free
state and the stable tumor state, and the likelihood of noise-inducing tumor
extinction, are characterized by the mean exit time (also called mean residence
time) and the escape probability, respectively. For various initial densities
of tumor cells, the mean exit time and the escape probability are computed with
different noise parameters. It is observed that unlike the Gaussian noise or
symmetric non-Gaussian noise, the asymmetric non-Gaussian noise plays a
constructive role in the tumor evolution in this simple model. By adjusting the
noise parameters, the mean exit time can be shortened and the escape

globular clusters tend to be less spatially concentrated than the metal-rich
ones; the metal-rich globular clusters in M81 do not demonstrate a centrally
concentrated spatial distribution as the metal-rich ones in M31 do; like our
Galaxy and M31, the globular clusters in M81 have a small radial metallicity
gradient. These results are consistent with those obtained based on a small
sample of M81 globular clusters. In addition, this paper showed that there is
evidence that a strong rotation of the M81 globular cluster system around the

cluster subsample, while the metal-poor globular cluster subsample shows no
evidence for rotation. The most significant difference between the rotation of

underwater produces Gaussian noise on the captured underwater images which
degrades the quality of images. The degraded underwater images are preprocessed
by applying homomorphic, wavelet denoising and anisotropic filtering
sequentially. The uncalibrated rectification technique is applied to
preprocessed images to rectify the left and right images. The rectified left

novel strategy including novel soft computing based strategy to speed up scalar

increases with $\delta$ for $1<\delta\lesssim 2$. Mean field behavior is seen
up to $\delta \approx 1.3$; weak dependence on $\delta$ is observed beyond this

found to be unimodal for $q < q_c$ and bimodal for $q > q_c$. The results are

Bose-Einstein condensates in spin-dependent optical lattices. The competition
between the spin-orbit coupling strength and the depth of the optical lattice
leads to a rich phase diagram. Without spin-orbit coupling, the spin-dependent
optical lattices separate the condensates into alternating spin domains with
opposite magnetization directions. With relatively weak spin-orbit coupling,
the spin domain wall is dramatically changed from N\'{e}el wall to Bloch wall.
For sufficiently strong spin-orbit coupling, vortex chains and antivortex

corresponding to the formation of a lattice composed of meron-pairs and
antimeron-pairs in the pseudospin representation. We also discuss how to

  Algebra of von Neumann","23 pages. No figures or tables",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The primary motivation for Moyal's approach to quantum mechanics was to
develop a phase space formalism for quantum phenomena by generalising the
techniques of classical probability theory. To this end, Moyal introduced a
quantum version of the characteristic function which immediately provides a
probability distribution. The approach is sometimes perceived negatively merely
as an attempt to return to classical notions, but the mathematics Moyal
develops is simply a re-expression of what is at the heart of quantum
mechanics, namely the non-commutative algebraic structure first introduced by
von Neumann in 1931. In this paper we will establish this relation and show
that the ""distribution function"", F(P,X,t) is simply the quantum mechanical
density matrix for a single particle. The coordinates, X and P, are not the
coordinates of the particle but the mean co-ordinates of a cell structure (a
`blob') in phase space, giving an intrinsically non-local description of each
individual particle, which becomes a point in the limit to order $\hbar^2$. We
discuss the significance of this non-commutative structure on the symplectic
geometry of the phase space for quantum processes.

Coexisting structures with different properties are found in the neighboring
nuclei. Many experiments have been performed over the last few years in which
in-band and out-of-band $\gamma$ transition probabilities have been measured. A
detailed interpretation of experimental data requires the use of a method going
beyond a mean-field approach that permits to determine spectra and transition
probabilities. Such methods have already been applied to selected isotopes in
this mass region. Our aim is to provide a systematic investigation of this mass
region in order to determine how well experimental data can be understood using
a state-of-the-art method for nuclear structure. The starting point of our
method is a set of mean-field wave functions generated with a constraint on the
axial quadrupole moment and using a Skyrme energy density functional.
Correlations beyond the mean field are introduced by projecting mean-field wave
functions on angular-momentum and particle number and by mixing the symmetry
restored wave functions as a function of the axial quadrupole moment. A
detailed comparison with the available data is performed for energies, charge
radii, spectroscopic quadrupole moments, $E0$ and $E2$ transition probabilities

classical light-cone structure of space-time, as well as providing a basis for
the description of quantum phenomena. By constructing an orthogonal Clifford
bundle with a Dirac connection, we make contact with quantum mechanics through
the Bohm formalism which emerges quite naturally from the connection, showing
that it is a structural feature of the mathematics. We then generalise the
approach to include the symplectic Clifford algebra, which leads us to a
non-commutative geometry with projections onto shadow manifolds. These shadow
manifolds are none other than examples of the phase space constructed by Bohm.
We also argue that this provides us with a mathematical structure that fits the
implicate-explicate order proposed by Bohm.

L* galaxies are included at all redshifts, are drawn from pre-existing
photometric redshift surveys. We then separated the samples into different
redshift slices and classify them as late- or early-type galaxies on the basis
of their specific star-formation rate. Axis-ratio measurements for the ~400
early-type galaxies in the redshift range 0.6<z<1.8 are accurate to 0.1 or
better. The projected axis-ratio distributions are then compared with lower

properties: early-type galaxies at z>1 are, on average, flatter than at z<1 and
the median projected axis ratio at a fixed mass decreases with redshift.

them of galaxies that are flat in projection. Merging is a plausible mechanism

Motivated by the latest results of the Higgs searches at the LHC and Tevatron,
we explore the possibility of disentangling these couplings from each other by
considering a scenario in which supersymmetry is broken spontaneously at a low
scale. In such a scenario, all the Higgs couplings, except the ones to the Z
and W bosons, receive tree level corrections that depend on the MSSM soft
parameters. In particular, the corrections to the Yukawa couplings depend on
the A-term soft parameter for the corresponding fermion, allowing for the
freedom to break their usual relations, even in the MSSM decoupling limit. We
highlight the main features of this scenario in terms of a benchmark point for
which the normalized Higgs coupling to the tau leptons is depleted, the
coupling to photons is enhanced, while all the other Higgs couplings, including
the one to the bottom quarks, are close to their corresponding SM values. We

and eigenvalues of covariance or scatter matrices in elliptical families. The
parametric tests extend the Gaussian likelihood ratio tests of Anderson (1963)
and their pseudo-Gaussian robustifications by Davis (1977) and Tyler (1981,
1983). The rank-based tests address a much broader class of problems, where
covariance matrices need not exist and principal components are associated with
more general scatter matrices. The proposed tests are shown to outperform daily
practice both from the point of view of validity as from the point of view of
efficiency. This is achieved by utilizing the Le Cam theory of locally
asymptotically normal experiments, in the nonstandard context, however, of a
curved parametrization. The results we derive for curved experiments are of
independent interest, and likely to apply in other contexts.

into the bcc (110) phase through an intermediate metastable fcc phase, and
then, on cooling, a diffuse bcc (110) $\rightarrow$ hcp transition is observed.
In films 6.1 to 8.2 nm thick there forms, on cooling, a twin fcc phase as a

With further increase of the bcc (001) film thickness there occurs martensitic

opens the door to a desirable generalization of the standard large deviation
theory (applicable to a set of $N$ nearly independent random variables) to
systems belonging to a special, though ubiquitous, class of strong
correlations. It focuses on three inter-related aspects, namely (i) we exhibit
strong numerical indications which suggest that the standard exponential
probability law is asymptotically replaced by a power-law as its dominant term
for large $N$; (ii) the subdominant term appears to be consistent with the
$q$-exponential behavior typical of systems following $q$-statistics, thus
reinforcing the thermodynamically extensive entropic nature of the exponent of
the $q$-exponential, basically $N$ times the $q$-generalized rate function;
(iii) the class of strong correlations that we have focused on corresponds to
attractors in the sense of the Central Limit Theorem which are $Q$-Gaussian
distributions (in principle $1 < Q < 3$), which relevantly differ from
(symmetric) L\'evy distributions, with the unique exception of Cauchy-Lorentz
distributions (which correspond to $Q = 2$), where they coincide, as well
known. In his Comment, Touchette has agreeably discussed point (i), but,
unfortunately, points (ii) and (iii) have, as we detail here, visibly escaped
to his analysis. Consequently, his conclusion claiming the absence of special
connection with $q$-exponentials is unjustified.

equations arises from many practical applications. Given a system of linear
matrix equations, however, such a low-rank solution does not always exist. In
this paper, we aim at developing some sufficient conditions for the existence
of a rank-one solution to the system of homogeneous linear matrix equations
(HLME) over the positive semidefinite cone. First, we prove that an existence
condition of a rank-one solution can be established by a homotopy invariance
theorem. The derived condition is closely related to the so-called
$P_\emptyset$ property of the function defined by quadratic transformations.
Second, we prove that the existence condition for a rank-one solution can be
also established through the maximum rank of the (positive semidefinite) linear
combination of given matrices. It is shown that an upper bound for the rank of
the solution to a system of HLME over the positive semidefinite cone can be
obtained efficiently by solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem.
Moreover, a sufficient condition for the nonexistence of a rank-one solution to
the system of HLME is also established in this paper.

approaches that are discussed in detail, including original developments at
both the macroscopic level and the microscopic level of density functional
theory (DFT). We emphasize that any approach, such as classical nucleation
theory, which is based on a purely macroscopic viewpoint does not lead to a
reliable representation when the radius of the drop becomes microscopic. The
so-called mechanical route which corresponds to a molecular-level extension of
the macroscopic theory of elasticity, and is particularly popular in molecular
dynamics simulation, also appears to be unreliable due to the inherent
ambiguity in the definition of the microscopic pressure tensor, an observation
which has been known for decades but is frequently ignored. In this vein, we
propose a non-local mean-field DFT for Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluids to examine
drops of varying size. A comparison of the predictions of our DFT with the
recent simulation data based on a second-order fluctuation analysis [J. G.
Sampayo et al., JCP 132, 141101 (2010)] reveals the consistency of the two
treatments. This observation points out the significance of fluctuation effects
in small drops, in contrast to what one observes in the case of planar
interfaces which are governed by the laws of mechanical equilibrium. A small
negative Tolman length and a non-monotonic behaviour of the surface tension
with the drop radius are predicted for the LJ fluid. Finally, the limits of a
validity of the Tolman approach, the effect of the range of the intermolecular
potential, and the behaviour of bubbles are briefly discussed.

well as the impact of the different data sets used in the analyses. When
considering bounds on the sum of the three active neutrino masses, the
information in the BAO signal from galaxy clustering measurements is
approximately equally powerful as the shape information from the matter power
spectrum. The most stringent bound we find is sum m_nu<0.32 eV at 95 % CL. When
non-standard neutrino scenarios with neff massless or massive neutrino species
are examined, power spectrum shape measurements provide slightly better bounds
than the BAO signal only, due to the breaking of parameter degeneracies. Recent
BOSS data combined with CMB and Hubble Space Telescope measurements give
neff=3.66^{+0.20 +0.73}_{-0.21 -0.69} in the massless neutrino scenario, and
similar results are obtained in the massive case. The evidence for extra
radiation neff>3 often claimed in the literature therefore remains at the 2
sigma level when considering up-to-date cosmological data sets. Measurements
from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe combined with a prior on the
Hubble parameter from the Hubble Space Telescope are very powerful in
constraining either the sum of the three active neutrino masses or the number

spreading in a metapopulation modeled as a complex network. The metapopulation
consists of susceptible and infected individuals that are grouped in
subpopulations symbolising cities and villages that are coupled by human travel
in a transportation network. By analytic methods and numerical simulations we
calculate the fraction of infected people in the metaopoluation in the long
time limit, as well as the relevant parameters characterising the epidemic
threshold that separates an epidemic from a non-epidemic phase. Within this
model, we investigate the effect of a heterogeneous network topology and a
heterogeneous subpopulation size distribution. Such a system is suited for
epidemic modeling where small villages and big cities exist simultaneously in
the metapopulation. We find that the heterogeneous conditions cause the
epidemic threshold to be a non-trivial function of the reaction rates (local
parameters), the network's topology (global parameters) and the cross-over
population size that separates ""village dynamics"" from ""city dynamics"".

provide a new approach to size of set other than cardinality. The generalized
measurement has application backgrounds such as a generalized problem in
dimension reduction, and has reasons from the existence of the minimum of both
the positive size and the positive graduation, i.e., both the minimum is the
size of the set ${0}$. The minimum of positive graduation in actual measurement
provides the possibility that an object cannot be partitioned arbitrarily,
e.g., an interval $[0, 1]$ cannot be partitioned by arbitrarily infinite times
to keep compatible with the minimum of positive size. For the measurement on
size of set, it can be assumed that this minimum is the size of ${0}$, in
symbols $|{0}|$ or graduation 1. For a set $S$, we generalize any graduation as
the size of a set $C_i$ where $\exists x \in S (x \in C_i)$, and $|S|$ is
represented by a pair, in symbols $(C, N(C))$, where ${C} = \cup {C_i}$ and
$N(C)$ is a set function on $C_i$, with $C_i$ independent of the order $i$ and
$N(C)$ reflecting the quantity of $C_i$. This pair is a generalized form of
box-counting dimension. The yielded size satisfies the properties of outer
measure in general cases, and satisfies the properties of measure in the case
of graduation 1; while in the reverse view, measure is a size using the
graduation of size of an interval. As for cardinality, the yielded size is a
one-to-one correspondence where only addition is allowable, a weak form of
cardinality, and rewrites Continuum Hypothesis using dimension as $\omega \dot
|{0,1}| = 1$. In the reverse view, cardinality of a set is a size in the
graduation of the set. The generalized measurement provides a unified approach
to dimension, measure, cardinality and hence infinity.
