xenon electroluminescent time projection chamber (TPC) that was built at the
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. It is a prototype of the planned
NEXT-100 $^{136}$Xe neutrino-less double beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$)
experiment with the main objectives of demonstrating near-intrinsic energy
resolution at energies up to 662 keV and of optimizing the NEXT-100 detector
design and operating parameters. Energy resolutions of $\sim$1% FWHM for 662
keV gamma rays were obtained at 10 and 15 atm and $\sim$5% FWHM for 30 keV
fluorescence xenon X-rays. These results demonstrate that 0.5% FWHM resolutions
for the 2,459 keV hypothetical neutrino-less double beta decay peak are
realizable. This energy resolution is a factor 7 to 20 better than that of the
current leading $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments using liquid xenon and thus
represents a significant advancement. We present also first results from a
track imaging system consisting of 64 silicon photo-multipliers recently
installed in NEXT-DBDM that, along with the excellent energy resolution,
demonstrates the key functionalities required for the NEXT-100 $0\nu\beta\beta$

Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained from the full Sloan Digital Sky Survey II
(SDSS-II) Supernova (SN) Survey, supplemented with host-galaxy spectroscopy
from the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). Our
photometric-classification method is based on the SN typing technique of Sako
et al. (2011), aided by host galaxy redshifts (0.05<z<0.55). SNANA simulations
of our methodology estimate that we have a SN Ia typing efficiency of 70.8%,
with only 3.9% contamination from core-collapse (non-Ia) SNe. We demonstrate
that this level of contamination has no effect on our cosmological constraints.
We quantify and correct for our selection effects (e.g., Malmquist bias) using
simulations. When fitting to a flat LambdaCDM cosmological model, we find that
our photometric sample alone gives omega_m=0.24+0.07-0.05 (statistical errors
only). If we relax the constraint on flatness, then our sample provides
competitive joint statistical constraints on omega_m and omega_lambda,
comparable to those derived from the spectroscopically-confirmed three-year
Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3). Using only our data, the statistics-only
result favors an accelerating universe at 99.96% confidence. Assuming a
constant wCDM cosmological model, and combining with H0, CMB and LRG data, we
obtain w=-0.96+0.10-0.10, omega_m=0.29+0.02-0.02 and omega_k=0.00+0.03-0.02
(statistical errors only), which is competitive with similar spectroscopically
confirmed SNe Ia analyses. Overall this comparison is re-assuring, considering
the lower redshift leverage of the SDSS-II SN sample (z<0.55) and the lack of
spectroscopic confirmation used herein. These results demonstrate the potential
of photometrically-classified SNe Ia samples in improving cosmological
constraints.

approximate posterior (that is, the prior times the approximate likelihood),

that the variance of the importance sampling weights vanishes as the sample

Performance of the overall approach is evaluated on simulated and real

occur viscous instability not detected by inviscid theory? (iii) can there
occur the ---necessarily viscous--- effect of Hopf bifurcation, or ""galloping

A model of heliosheath density and energy spectra of alpha-particles
and He+ ions carried by the solar wind is developed. Neutralization of
heliosheath He+ ions, mainly by charge exchange (CX) with neutral interstellar
H and He atoms, gives rise to ~0.2 - ~100 keV fluxes of energetic neutral He
atoms (He ENA). Such fluxes, if observed, would give information about plasmas
in the heliosheath and heliospheric tail. Methods. Helium ions crossing the
termination shock (TS) constitute suprathermal (test) particles convected by
(locally also diffusing through) hydrodynamically calculated background plasma
flows (three versions of flows are employed). The He ions proceed from the TS
towards heliopause (HP) and finally to the heliospheric tail (HT). Calculations
of the evolution of alpha- and He+ particle densities and energy spectra
include binary interactions with background plasma and interstellar atoms,
adiabatic heating (cooling) resulting from flow compression (rarefaction), and
Coulomb scattering on background plasma. Results. Neutralization of
suprathermal He ions leads to the emergence of He ENA fluxes with energy
spectra modified by the Compton-Getting effect at emission and ENA loss during
flight to the Sun. Energy-integrated He ENA intensities are in the range ~0.05
- ~50 cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1 depending on spectra at the TS (assumed
kappa-distributions), background plasma model, and look direction. The
tail/apex intensity ratio varies between ~1.8 and ~800 depending on model
assumptions. Energy spectra are broad with maxima in the ~0.2 - ~3 keV range
depending on the look direction and model. Conclusions. Expected heliosheath He
ENA fluxes may be measurable based on the capabilities of the IBEX spacecraft.
Data could offer insight into the heliosheath structure and improve
understanding of the post-TS solar wind plasmas. HT direction and extent could
be assessed.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, most IDSs lack the capability to
detect novel or previously unknown attacks. A special type of IDSs, called
Anomaly Detection Systems, develop models based on normal system or network
behavior, with the goal of detecting both known and unknown attacks. Anomaly
detection systems face many problems including high rate of false alarm,
ability to work in online mode, and scalability. This paper presents a
selective survey of incremental approaches for detecting anomaly in normal
system or network traffic. The technological trends, open problems, and
challenges over anomaly detection using incremental approach are also
discussed.

We then show that, as in the homogeneous case, the GPTs are the basic building
blocks for the far-field expansion of the voltage in the presence of the
conductivity inclusion. Relating the GPTs to the Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD)
map, it follows that the full knowledge of the GPTs allows unique determination
of the conductivity distribution. Furthermore, we show important properties of
the the GPTs, such as symmetry and positivity, and derive bounds satisfied by
their harmonic sums. We also compute the sensitivity of the GPTs with respect
to changes in the conductivity distribution and propose an algorithm for
reconstructing conductivity distributions from their GPTs. This provides a new
strategy for solving the highly nonlinear and ill-posed inverse conductivity
problem. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed algorithm by preforming a
sensitivity analysis and giving some numerical examples.

recently introduced for efficient view generation at arbitrary camera
positions. Encoding rate control has thus to consider both texture and depth
data. Due to different structures of depth and texture images and their
different roles on the rendered views, distributing the available bit budget
between them however requires a careful analysis. Information loss due to
texture coding affects the value of pixels in synthesized views while errors in
depth information lead to shift in objects or unexpected patterns at their
boundaries. In this paper, we address the problem of efficient bit allocation
between textures and depth data of multiview video sequences. We adopt a
rate-distortion framework based on a simplified model of depth and texture
images. Our model preserves the main features of depth and texture images.
Unlike most recent solutions, our method permits to avoid rendering at encoding
time for distortion estimation so that the encoding complexity is not
augmented. In addition to this, our model is independent of the underlying
inpainting method that is used at decoder. Experiments confirm our theoretical
results and the efficiency of our rate allocation strategy.

had circumstellar disks previously known from infrared observations at shorter
wavelengths, while eighteen of them had no previous evidence for a disk. We
detect a total of 15 disks as all previously known disks are detected at one or
more Herschel wavelengths and two additional disks are identified for the first
time. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of our targets seem to trace the
dissipation of the primordial disk and the transition to the debris disk

including two objects with SEDs indistinguishable from those of typical
Classical T Tauri stars, four objects that have significant deficit of excess
emission at all IR wavelengths, and one ""pre-transitional"" object with a known
gap in the disk. Despite their previous WTTS classification, we find that the
seven targets in our sample with optically thick disks show evidence for
accretion. The remaining eight disks have weaker IR excesses similar to those
of optically thin debris disks. Six of them are warm and show significant 24
micron Spitzer excesses, while the last two are newly identified cold

a randomly flipped decision to the other nodes in the form of a binary

show that if each node only learns from a bounded number of immediate

radiation, X-ray free electron lasers, high harmonic generation, soft X-ray
laser and electrons. Despite these rapid advances, it remains a challenge to
reconstruct fine features in weakly scattering objects such as biological
specimens from noisy data. Here we present an effective iterative algorithm,
termed oversampling smoothness (OSS), for phase retrieval of noisy diffraction
intensities. OSS exploits the correlation information among the pixels or
voxels in the region outside of a support in real space. By properly applying
spatial frequency filters to the pixels or voxels outside the support at
different stage of the iterative process (i.e. a smoothness constraint), OSS
finds a balance between the hybrid input-output (HIO) and error reduction (ER)
algorithms to search for a global minimum in solution space, while reducing the
oscillations in the reconstruction. Both our numerical simulations with Poisson
noise and experimental data from a biological cell indicate that OSS
consistently outperforms the HIO, ER-HIO and noise robust (NR)-HIO algorithms
at all noise levels in terms of accuracy and consistency of the
reconstructions. We expect OSS to find application in the rapidly growing CDI
field as well as other disciplines where phase retrieval from noisy Fourier
magnitudes is needed.

systems, and partially responsible for generating and controlling rhythmic
movements such as locomotion, respiration, swallowing and so on. Clarifying the
role of the network connectivities for generating cyclic patterns is
fundamental for understanding the generation of rhythmic movements. In this
paper, the storage of binary cycles in neural networks is investigated. We call
a cycle $\Sigma$ admissible if a connectivity matrix satisfying the cycle's
transition conditions exists, and construct it using the pseudoinverse learning
rule. Our main focus is on the structural features of admissible cycles and
corresponding network topology. We show that $\Sigma$ is admissible if and only
if its discrete Fourier transform contains exactly $r={rank}(\Sigma)$ nonzero
columns. Based on the decomposition of the rows of $\Sigma$ into loops, where a
loop is the set of all cyclic permutations of a row, cycles are classified as
simple cycles, separable or inseparable composite cycles. Simple cycles contain
rows from one loop only, and the network topology is a feedforward chain with
feedback to one neuron if the loop-vectors in $\Sigma$ are cyclic permutations
of each other. Composite cycles contain rows from at least two disjoint loops,
and the neurons corresponding to the rows in $\Sigma$ from the same loop are
identified with a cluster. Networks constructed from separable composite cycles
decompose into completely isolated clusters. For inseparable composite cycles
at least two clusters are connected, and the cluster-connectivity is related to
the intersections of the spaces spanned by the loop-vectors of the clusters.
Simulations showing successfully retrieved cycles in continuous-time
Hopfield-type networks and in networks of spiking neurons are presented.

extracting important data in ever larger datasets. Advances in hardware
technology have lead to the increasingly wide spread use of flash storage
devices. Such devices have clear benefits over traditional hard drives in terms
of latency of access, bandwidth and random access capabilities particularly
when reading data. There are however some interesting trade-offs to consider
when leveraging the advanced features of such devices. On a relative scale
writing to such devices can be expensive. This is because typical flash devices
(NAND technology) are updated in blocks. A minor update to a given block
requires the entire block to be erased, followed by a re-writing of the block.
On the other hand, sequential writes can be two orders of magnitude faster than
random writes. In addition, random writes are degrading to the life of the
flash drive, since each block can support only a limited number of erasures.
TF-IDF can be implemented using a counting hash table. In general, hash tables
are a particularly challenging case for the flash drive because this data
structure is inherently dependent upon the randomness of the hash function, as
opposed to the spatial locality of the data. This makes it difficult to avoid
the random writes incurred during the construction of the counting hash table
for TF-IDF. In this paper, we will study the design landscape for the
development of a hash table for flash storage devices. We demonstrate how to
effectively design a hash table with two related hash functions, one of which
exhibits a data placement property with respect to the other. Specifically, we
focus on three designs based on this general philosophy and evaluate the
trade-offs among them along the axes of query performance, insert and update
times and I/O time through an implementation of the TF-IDF algorithm.

unique morphology, a universal density profile, and a tight correlation between
positions and velocities of the material. As such they are accessible to
analytical treatment, and can provide a relatively clean system for probing the
gravitational potential of the host galaxy. In this work we present a simple
analytical model that describes the density profile, phase-space distribution,
and geometry of a shell, and whose parameters are directly related to physical
characteristics of the interacting galaxies. The model makes three assumptions:
that their orbit is radial, that the potential of the host is spherical at the
shell radii, and that the satellite galaxy had a Maxwellian velocity
distribution. We quantify the error introduced by the first two assumptions and
show that selecting shells by their appearance on the sky is a sufficient basis
to assume that these simplifications are valid. We further demonstrate that (1)
given only an image of a shell, the radial gravitational force at the shell
edge and the phase-space density of the satellite are jointly constrained, (2)
that combining the image with measurements of either point line-of-sight
velocities or integrated spectra will yield an independent estimate of the
gravitational force at a shell, and (3) that an independent measurement of this
force is obtained for each shell observed around a given galaxy, potentially
enabling a determination of the galactic mass distribution.

$5^\circ$. The remanent corrections depend on the strong phase of the $D$

consider, generates an RG flow to a nearby IR fixed point. These models
describe hilltop inflation, where the inflaton rolls from a local maximum of
the potential in the infinite past (corresponding to the IR fixed point of the
dual QFT) to reach a nearby local minimum in the infinite future (corresponding
to the UV of the dual QFT). Through purely holographic means, we compute the
spectra and bispectra of scalar and tensor cosmological perturbations. The QFT
correlators to which these observables map holographically may be calculated
using conformal perturbation theory, even when the dual QFT is strongly
coupled. Both the spectra and the bispectra may be expressed this way in terms
of CFT correlators that are fixed, up to a few constants, by conformal
invariance. The form of slow-roll inflationary correlators is thus determined
by the perturbative breaking of the de Sitter isometries away from the fixed

point, we find exact agreement with known expressions for the slow-roll power
spectra and non-Gaussianities.

rently used to keep frequency deviations small. Although generation-load
imbalance can be very localized, both controls primarily rely on frequency
deviation as their in- put. The time scales of control require the outputs of
the centralized integral control to be communicated to distant generators every
few seconds. We reconsider this con- trol/communication architecture and
suggest a hybrid ap- proach that utilizes parameterized feedback policies that
can be implemented in a fully distributed manner because the inputs to these
policies are local observables at each generator. Using an ensemble of
forecasts of load and time-intermittent generation representative of possible
fu- ture scenarios, we perform a centralized off-line stochas- tic optimization
to select the generator-specific feedback parameters. These parameters need
only be communi- cated to generators once per control period (60 minutes in our

crucial and reduces frequency deviations by a factor of ten. We demonstrate our

effective stress energy generated by the graviton mass term is a cosmological
constant for any isotropic metric. Since they are exact, these solutions mimic
a cosmological constant in the presence of any matter-induced isotropic metric
perturbation. In the Stueckelberg formulation, this stress energy is carried
entirely by the spatial Stueckelberg field. We show that any stress energy
carried by fluctuations in the spatial field away from the exact solution
always decays away in an expanding universe. However, the dynamics of the

Stueckelberg field, which is equivalent to the unitary gauge time coordinate.
This dependence resolves an apparent conflict in the existing literature by
showing that there is a special unitary time choice for which the field
dynamics and energy density perturbations vanish identically. In general, the
isotropic system has a single dynamical degree of freedom requiring two sets of
initial data; however, only one of these initial data choices will affect the
observable metric. Finally, we construct cosmological solutions with a
well-defined perturbative initial value formulation and comment on alternate

to its initial brightening in August (2012-A) and its dramatic rebrightening in
early October (2012-B). Based on line fluxes and velocities measured in our
spectra, we find a surprisingly low I(H-alpha)/I(H-beta) ~ 1.3-1.4 in the
2012-B spectra. Such a ratio implies either a rare Case B recombination
scenario where H-alpha, but not H-beta, is optically thick, or an extremely
high density for the circumstellar material of n_e > 10^13 cm^(-3) The H-alpha
line intensity yields a minimum radiating surface area of >~20,000 AU^2 in
H-alpha at the peak of SN 2009ip's photometric evolution. Combined with the
nature of this object's spectral evolution in 2012, a high circumstellar
density and large radiating surface area imply the presence of a thin disk
geometry around the central star (and, consequently, a possible binary
companion), suggesting that the observed 2012-B rebrightening of SN 2009ip can

the list of known O-type stars in the dwarf irregular galaxy IC1613, whose
metallicity is smaller than the SMC's by roughly a factor 2.
  Using the reddening-free Q-parameter, evolutionary masses and GALEX

low-resolution R~1000 GTC-OSIRIS spectra for a fraction of them and performed
spectral classification, the only way to unequivocally confirm candidate
OB-stars. We have discovered 8 new O-type stars in IC1613, increasing the list

spectra were analyzed with the model atmosphere code FASTWIND to derive stellar
parameters. We present the first spectral type -- effective temperature scale

IC1613 is about 1000K hotter than the scale at the SMC. The analysis of an

our modelling of M31 as a result of a former gas-rich major merger, we find
that one of the expected tidal tail produced during the event may have reached
the MW. Such a coincidence may appear quite exceptional, but the MW indeed lies
within the small volume delineated by the tidal tail at the present epoch. In
our scenario, most of the MW dwarves, including the MCs, may have been formed

leads to a fair reproduction of the VPOS as well as to a simple explanation of

allow the triple system to remain intact for millions of orbits while
efficiently exchanging angular momentum with the WD-WD binary. In ~ 5% of the
initial orientations, the inner orbit efficiently scans the (equal energy)
phase space in the region of zero angular momentum. In these systems, the
binary experiences increasingly closer, stochastic, pericenter approaches r_p ~
a/2N with the increasing number (N) of orbits elapsed. Within N~10^5(a/30AU)
orbits, a collision is likely to occur. This is shown by performing \simten
thousand 3-body integrations and is explained by simple analytic arguments. The
collisions are conservatively restricted to ""clean"" collisions in which all
passages prior to the collision are greater than 4R_WD=4x10^9cm. In particular,
within the last single orbit, the pericenter changes from r_p>4R_WD to a
collision value of r_p<2R_WD. The effects of tidal deformations and General
Relativistic (GR) corrections are negligible in these scenarios. The WDs
approach each other with a high velocity >3000 km/s and the collision is likely
to detonate the WDs leading to a type Ia SNe. If a significant fraction of WDs
reside in such triples, the rate of such collisions is as high as the SNe Ia

dv/dt_o = 0.3 cm/s/yr, but they demonstrate the lack of peculiar acceleration
in absorption line systems and the long-term frequency stability of modern
radio telescopes. A comparison of UV metal absorption lines to the 21 cm line
improves constraints on the cosmic variation of physical constants:
Delta(alpha^2 g_p mu)/(alpha^2 g_p mu) = (-1.2 +/- 1.4) x 10^-6 in the redshift
range z=0.24-2.04. The linear evolution over the last 10.4 Gyr is (-0.2 +/-
2.7) x 10^-16 yr^-1, consistent with no variation. The cosmic acceleration
could be directly measured in ~125 years using current telescopes or in ~5
years using a Square Kilometer Array, but systematic effects will arise at the
1 cm/s/yr level.

metal-poor stars in Sculptor compared to the Milky Way halo. The [alpha/Fe]
ratios show a range from +0.5 to -0.5, a larger variation than seen in Galactic
samples although typically consistent within 1-2sigma. One star seems mildly
iron-enhanced. Our program stars show no deviations from the Galactic abundance

abundances are, however, below the Galactic values for several stars. Overall,
we conclude that the CaT lines are a successful metallicity indicator down to

the first time the joint effects of Newtonian and relativistic perturbations to
the motion, including the dragging of inertial frames by a spinning SBH as well
as torques due to finite-N asymmetries in the field-star distribution (resonant
relaxation, RR). The evolution of the S-star orbits is strongly influenced by
the Schwarzschild barrier (SB), the locus in the (E,L) plane where RR is
ineffective at driving orbits to higher eccentricities. Formation models that
invoke tidal disruption of binary stars by the SBH tend to place stars below
(i.e., at higher eccentricities than) the SB; some stars remain below the
barrier, but most stars are able to penetrate it, after which they are subject
to RR and achieve a nearly thermal distribution of eccentricities. This process
requires roughly 50 Myr in nuclear models with relaxed stellar cusps, or >~10
Myr, regardless of the initial distribution of eccentricities, in nuclear
models that include a dense cluster of 10 M_Sun black holes. We find a
probability of <~1% for any S-star to be tidally disrupted by the SBH over its

valence band (VB) surface states from the opposite surfaces of a thin film, and
its size is determined by the film thickness. This gap formation could open the
possibility of thin-film TI-based metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect
transistors (MOSFETs). Here we explore the performance of MOSFETs based on TI
thin films, specifically Bi2Se3, using quantum ballistic transport simulations
with the tight-binding Hamiltonian in the atomic orbital basis. Our simulations
indicate that Bi2Se3 MOSFET will be vulnerable to short-channel effects due to
the high relative dielectric constant of Bi2Se3(~100)despite its expected
excellent electrostatic integrity inherent in a two-dimensional system, and
will have other limitations as compared to silicon-based MOSFETs. However,
Bi2Se3 MOSFETs, and presumably other TI-based MOSFETs, appear to provide
reasonable performance that perhaps could provide novel device opportunities
when combined with novel TI properties such as spin-polarized surface states.

In the presence of lateral gene transfer (LGT), however, this may not be the
case, because the species lineage from which a gene was transferred may have
gone extinct or not have been sampled. Because it is not feasible to specify or
reconstruct the complete phylogeny of all species, we must describe the
evolution of genes outside the represented phylogeny by modelling the
speciation dynamics that gave rise to the complete phylogeny. We demonstrate
that if the number of sampled species is small compared to the total number of
existing species, the overwhelming majority of gene transfers involve
speciation to, and evolution along extinct or unsampled lineages. We show that
the evolution of genes along extinct or unsampled lineages can to good
approximation be treated as those of independently evolving lineages described
by a few global parameters. Using this result, we derive an algorithm to
calculate the probability of a gene tree and recover the maximum likelihood
reconciliation given the phylogeny of the sampled species. Examining 473 near
universal gene families from 36 cyanobacteria, we find that nearly a third of
transfer events -- 28% -- appear to have topological signatures of evolution
along extinct species, but only approximately 6% of transfers trace their
ancestry to before the common ancestor of the sampled cyanobacteria.

comparing observations of Sgr A* with the fall-back model for stellar debris,
we suggested that the TDE rate in our Galaxy should not significantly exceed
$0.002 yr^{-1}$, therefore a fraction of the parameter space for the IMBH,
concentrating at the high-mass end, can already be excluded. To derive
constraint in the remaining parameter space, it is crucial to observationally
confirm or reject the stellar-disruption rate between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}

SN 1987A. We present images and spectra of SBW1 obtained with HST, Spitzer, and
Gemini South. HST images of SBW1 do not exhibit long Rayleigh-Taylor fingers,
which are presumed to cause the hotspots in the SN1987A ring, but instead show
a geometrically thin clumpy ring. The radial mass distribution and size scales
of inhomogeneities in SBW1's ring closely resemble those in the SN1987A ring,
but the more complete disk expected to reside at the base of the RT fingers is
absent. This structure may explain why portions of the SN1987A ring between the
hotspots have not yet brightened after more than 15 years. The model we suggest
does not require a fast wind colliding with a previous red supergiant wind.
More surprisingly, images of SBW1 also reveal diffuse emission filling the
interior of the ring in H-alpha and thermal-IR emission; 190K dust dominates
the 8-20 micron luminosity (but contains only 1e-5Msun). Cooler (85K dust
resides in the equatorial ring itself (dust mass of 5e-3Msun). Diffuse emission
extends inward to 1 arcsecond from the central star, where a paucity of
emission suggests an inner hole excavated by the wind. We propose that diffuse
emission inside the ring arises from an ionized flow of material
photoevaporated from the dense ring, and it prevents the supergiant wind from
advancing in the equator. This inner emission could correspond to a structure
hypothesized to reside around SN1987A that was never directly detected. We
suggest that photoionization can play an important dynamical role in shaping
the ring nebula, and we speculate that this might help explain the origin of
the polar rings around SN1987A. abridged.

construct Multi-Gaussian Expansion models of the surface brightnesses of our

found in our sample, and in addition we reproduce the results of
state-of-the-art photometry in the literature with residuals of 0.04 mags. We
utilise these photometric models and SAURON integral-field spectroscopy,
combined with Jeans dynamical modelling, to determine the local V_esc derived
from the surface brightness. We find that the local V_esc is tightly correlated
with the Mgb and Fe5015 linestrengths and optical colours, and anti-correlated
with the Hbeta linestrength. In the case of the Mgb and Colour - V_esc
relations we find that the relation within individual galaxies follows the
global relation between different galaxies. We intentionally ignored any
uncertain contribution due to dark matter since we are seeking an empirical
description of stellar population gradients in early-type galaxies that is
ideal for quantitative comparison with model predictions. We identify a
population of galaxies that occur only at low V_esc that exhibit negative
gradients in the Mgb - and Colour -V_esc relations. These galaxies typically
have young central stellar populations and contain significant amounts of
molecular gas and dust. Combining these results with N-body simulations of
binary mergers we use the Mgb-V_esc relation to constrain the possible number
of dry mergers experienced by the local early-type galaxy population - a
typical massive ETG can have experienced only ~1.5 major mergers before
becoming a significant outlier in the Mgb-V_esc relation. [Abridged]

component of continuous-time DUE models, DNL aims at describing and predicting
the spatial-temporal evolution of traffic flows on a network that is consistent
with established route and departure time choices of travelers, by introducing
appropriate dynamics to flow propagation, flow conservation, and travel delays.
The DNL procedure gives rise to the path delay operator, which associates a
vector of path flows (path departure rates) with the corresponding path travel
costs. In this paper, we establish strong continuity of the path delay operator
for networks whose arc flows are described by the link delay model (Friesz et

metallicities of late-type stars is difficult because visible wavelength
spectra of their cool atmospheres contain many overlapping absorption lines,
preventing the measurement of equivalent widths. We present new methods, and
improved calibrations of existing methods, to determine metallicities of late-K
and M dwarfs from moderate resolution (1300 < R < 2000) visible and infrared
spectra. We select a sample of 112 wide binary systems that contain a late-type
companion to a solar-type primary star. Our sample includes 62 primary stars
with previously published metallicities, as well as 50 stars with metallicities
determined from our own observations. We use our sample to empirically
determine which features in the spectrum of the companion are best correlated
with the metallicity of the primary. We derive metallicity calibrations for
different wavelength ranges, and show that it is possible to get metallicities
reliable to < 0.10 dex using either visible, J, H, or K band spectra. Our
calibrations are applicable to dwarfs with metallicities of -1.04 < [Fe/H]<
+0.56 and spectral types from K7 to M5. Lastly, we use our sample of wide
binaries to test and refine existing calibrations to determine M dwarf
metallicities. We find that the zeta parameter, which measures the ratio of TiO
can CaH bands, is correlated with [Fe/H] for super-solar metallicities, and
zeta does not always correctly identify metal-poor M dwarfs. We also find that
existing calibrations in the K and H band are quite reliable for stars with
[Fe/H] > -0.5, but are less useful for more metal-poor stars.

fraction trajectories, $\Xe (z)$, by constraining low-order principal
components of perturbations to the standard recombination scenario
($\Xe$-eigenmodes) in the circa 2011 SPT, ACT and WMAP7 data. Although the
trajectories are statistically consistent with the standard recombination, we
find that there is a tension similar to that found by varying the helium

and we applied our framework to them: we find the tension continues, with
slightly higher significance, in the new 2012 SPT data, but find no tension
with the standard model of recombination in the new 2012 ACT data. We find that
the prior probabilities on the eigenamplitudes are substantially influenced by
the requirement that $\Xe$ trajectories conserve electron number. We propose
requiring a sufficient entropy decrease between posterior and prior
marginalized distributions be used as an $\Xe$-mode selection criterion. We
find that in the case of the 2011 SPT/ACT+WMAP7 data only two modes are
constrainable, but upcoming ACTPol, Planck and SPTPol data will be able to test
more modes and more precisely address the current tension.

coupled quark gluon plasma. Finite temperature lattice QCD calculations show
the interaction measure, $\Delta\equiv(\epsilon-3p)/T^4$, is sizeable over a
considerable range of temperatures above the deconfinement temperature, which
may also indicate that the plasma is strongly interacting. For the ideal gas
with massless particles, the interaction measure is zero. A nonzero value is
probably due to either the interaction or the mass. In order to see the
contribution of the particle mass to the interaction measure, in this paper we
study a system without any interactions, i.e., an ideal gas with massive
particles. After assembling the standard formulas of the quantum statistics
with relativistic energy, we calculate the energy density, the pressure and the
interaction measure. We find that their dependences on temperature reproduce
the qualitative features of the lattice result. The interaction measure is
nonzero for an ideal gas, which demonstrates that the particle mass contributes
to the interaction measure. By our estimate, in the interaction measure
obtained by the lattice calculation, quark mass contributes less than (40-50)%.
There are sizeable residue interactions in the deconfined phase.

Supercluster. Moreover, TRGB distances are now available for six SNe Ia; if
their mean luminosity is applied to distant SNe Ia, one obtains H0 = 64.6 +/-

hierarchical tree and different channels are highly correlated. Therefore, the
full data could follow the forest structure and we call this property as
\emph{forest sparsity}. It exploits both intra- and inter- channel correlations
and enriches the family of existing model-based compressive sensing theories.
The proposed theory indicates that only $\mathcal{O}(Tk+\log(N/k))$
measurements are required for multi-channel data with forest sparsity, where
$T$ is the number of channels, $N$ and $k$ are the length and sparsity number
of each channel respectively. This result is much better than
$\mathcal{O}(Tk+T\log(N/k))$ of tree sparsity, $\mathcal{O}(Tk+k\log(N/k))$ of
joint sparsity, and far better than $\mathcal{O}(Tk+Tk\log(N/k))$ of standard
sparsity. In addition, we extend the forest sparsity theory to the multiple
measurement vectors problem, where the measurement matrix is a block-diagonal
matrix. The result shows that the required measurement bound can be the same as
that for dense random measurement matrix, when the data shares equal energy in
each channel. A new algorithm is developed and applied on four example
applications to validate the benefit of the proposed model. Extensive

the HOMO level alone cannot account for the observed fluctuations in the
thermopower, and that the thermo-voltage distributions obtained using the most
common method, the Non-equilibrium Green's function method, are qualitatively
different than those observed experimentally. We argue that this inconsistency
between the theory and experiment is due to the level broadening, which is
inherently built-in to the method, and smears out any variations of the
transmission on energy scales smaller than the level broadening. We show that
although this smearing only weakly affects the transmission, it has a large
effect on the calculated thermopower. Using the theory of open quantum systems
we account for both the magnitude of the variations and the qualitative form of
the distributions, and show that they arise not only from variations in the
HOMO-Fermi level offset, but also from variations of the local density of
states at the contact point between the molecule and the electrode.

that both the fraction of the available whitespace that the nodes fail to

is shown that, surprisingly, the optimal scaling is still $\log(n)/n$ even in

performance metric. The optimal scaling of the radio range and the necessary
minimum transmitter separation is determined, that ensure that the sum absolute
error in transmitter localization is minimized, with high probability, as $n$

determined, given the distribution of the transmitters, and the resulting

chain with local proposals is often slowly mixing; while a Small-World sampler
\citep{guankrone} -- a Markov chain that uses a mixture of local and long-range
proposals -- is fast mixing. However, a Small-World sampler suffers from the
curse of dimensionality because its spectral gap depends on the volume of each
mode. We present a new sampler that combines tempering, Small-World sampling,
and producing long-range proposals from samples in companion chains (e.g.
Equi-Energy sampler). In its simplest form the sampler employs two Small-World
chains: an exploring chain and a sampling chain. The exploring chain samples
$\pi_t(x) \propto \pi(x)^{1/t}$, $t\in [1,\infty)$, and builds up an empirical
distribution. Using this empirical distribution as its long-range proposal, the
sampling chain is designed to have a stationary distribution $\pi(x)$. We prove
ergodicity of the algorithm and study its convergence rate. We show that the
spectral gap of the exploring chain is enlarged by a factor of $t^{d}$ and that
of the sampling chain is shrunk by a factor of $t^{-d}$. Importantly, the
spectral gap of the exploring chain depends on the ""size"" of $\pi_t(x)$ while
that of sampling chain does not. Overall, the sampler enlarges a severe
bottleneck at the cost of shrinking a mild one, hence achieves faster mixing.
The penalty on the spectral gap of the sampling chain can be significantly
alleviated when extending the algorithm to multiple chains whose temperatures
$\{t_k\}$ follow a geometric progression. If we allow $t_k \rightarrow 0$, the
sampler becomes a global optimizer.

coronal magnetic field models --- Potential-Field Source-Surface (PFSS) models
--- it has been reported that model field strengths above flare sites tend to
be weaker in when CMEs occur than when eruptions fail to occur. This suggests
that potential field models might usefully quantify magnetic confinement. An
implication of this idea is that a decrease in model field strength overlying a
possible eruption site should correspond to diminished confinement, implying an
eruption is more likely. We have searched for such an effect by {\em post
facto} investigation of the time evolution of model field strengths above a
sample of 10 eruption sites, which included both slow and fast CMEs. In most
events we study, we find no statistically significant evolution in either: (i)
the rate of magnetic field decay with height; (ii) the strength of overlying
magnetic fields near 50 Mm; (iii) or the ratio of fluxes at low and high
altitudes (below 1.1$R_{\odot}$, and between 1.1--1.5$R_{\odot}$,
respectively). Instead, we found that overlying field strengths and overlying
flux tend to increase slightly, and their rates of decay with height become
slightly more gradual, consistent with increased confinement. Since CMEs occur
regardless of whether the parameters we use to quantify confinement are
increasing or decreasing, either: (i) these parameters do not accurately
characterize confinement in CME source regions; or (ii) systematic evolution in
the large-scale magnetic environment of CME source regions is not, by itself, a

The current understanding of the excitations and their physical interpretation
in the molecular nanomagnets which represent large magnetic clusters is then
presented, with an own section devoted to the subclass of the single-molecule
magnets which are distinguished by displaying quantum tunneling of the
magnetization. Finally, some quantum many-body states are summarized which

fallback disks, this rotational behavior is expected in certain phases of the
long-term evolution. Using the same model as employed earlier to explain the
evolution of anomalous X-ray pulsars and soft gamma-ray repeaters, we show that
the period, the first and second period derivatives and the X-ray luminosity of
this source can simultaneously acquire the observed values for a neutron star
evolving with a fallback disk. We find that the required strength of the dipole
field that can produce the source properties is in the range of 10^{12} -
10^{13} G on the pole of the neutron star. When the model source reaches the
current state properties of PSR J1734-3333, accretion onto the star has not
started yet, allowing the source to operate as a regular radio pulsar. Our
results imply that PSR J1734-3333 is at an age of ~ 3 x 10^4 - 2 x 10^5 years.
Such sources will have properties like the X-ray dim isolated neutron stars or
transient AXPs at a later epoch of weak accretion from the diminished fallback

assume ad hoc that gravitation is mediated by virtual exchange particles -
gravitons - with very small but non-zero masses. The resulting density and mass
profiles are proportional to the mass of the gravitating body. The mass profile
scales with the centripetal acceleration experienced by a test particle
orbiting the central mass; this comes at the cost of postulating a universal
characteristic acceleration a0 = 4.3*10^{-12} m/s^2 (or 8*pi*a0 = 1.1*10^{-10}

curves, the Tully-Fisher/Faber-Jackson relations, the mass
discrepancy-acceleration relation of galaxies, the surface
brightness-acceleration relation of galaxies, the kinematics of galaxy
clusters, and ""Renzo's rule"" correctly; additional (dark) mass components are

they need to be driven from outside in order to keep them away from
equilibrium. While the internal mean entropy of such stationary systems is
constant, the external drive will on average increase the entropy in the
environment. This external entropy production is usually quantified by a simple
formula, stating that each microscopic transition of the system between two
configurations $c \to c'$ with rate $w_{c\to c'}$ changes the entropy in the
environment by $\Delta S_{\rm env} = {\ln w_{c \to c'}}-{\ln w_{c' \to c}}$.
According to this formula irreversible transitions $c \to c'$ with a vanishing
backward rate $w_{c'\to c}=0$ would produce an infinite amount of entropy.
However, in experiments designed to mimic such processes, a divergent entropy
production, that would cause an infinite increase of heat in the environment,
is not seen. The reason is that in an experimental realization the backward
process can be suppressed but its rate always remains slightly positive,
resulting in a finite entropy production. The paper discusses how this entropy
production can be estimated and specifies a lower bound depending on the
observation time.

motility by the spontaneous breakdown of a discrete symmetry. The model we
study offers a simple representation of a ""cell extract"" comprising, e.g., a
droplet of actomyosin solution. (Such extracts are used experimentally to model
the cytoskeleton.) Actomyosin is an active gel whose polarity describes the
mean sense of alignment of actin fibres. In the absence of polymerization and
depolymerization processes ('treadmilling'), the gel's dynamics arises solely
from the contractile motion of myosin motors; this should be unchanged when
polarity is inverted. Our results suggest that motility can arise in the
absence of treadmilling, by spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of polarity
inversion symmetry. Adapting our model to wall-bound cells in two dimensions,
we find that as wall friction is reduced, treadmilling-induced motility falls
but SSB-mediated motility rises. The latter might therefore be crucial in three
dimensions where frictional forces are likely to be modest. At a supra-cellular
level, the same generic mechanism can impart motility to aggregates of
non-motile but active bacteria; we show that SSB in this (extensile) case leads
generically to rotational as well as translational motion.

Weak Scale, i.e. in the region 1/R ~ (0.1-20) TeV. From another hand the
general trends of this idea has been related to the possible existence some
extra space-time noncompact dimensions of the universe. In this context it
would be first serious encounter with the dual conception between the physical
phenomena of microcosmos and of universe. One of the main goals is to find some
new space-time peculiarities and structures that might explain the formation of
our visible D=(3+1)-universe with all its space-time and internal symmetries
which could be only a part of a vast Universe filled with other kinds of
matter. The main difficulties of such experiments related to the possible

taxonomy like WorldNet or Ontology. Measurement of similarity between text
segments or concepts is very useful for many applications like information
retrieval, ontology matching, text mining, and question answering and so on.
Several measures have been developed for measuring similarity between two
concepts: out of these we see that the measure given by Wu and Palmer [1] is
simple, and gives good performance. Our measure is based on their measure but
strengthens it. Wu and Palmer [1] measure has a disadvantage that it does not
consider how far the concepts are semantically. In our measure we include the
shortest path between the concepts and the depth of whole taxonomy together
with the distances used in Wu and Palmer [1]. Also the measure has following
disadvantage i.e. in some situations, the similarity of two elements of an IS-A
ontology contained in the neighborhood exceeds the similarity value of two
elements contained in the same hierarchy. Our measure introduces a penalization
factor for this case based upon shortest length between the concepts and depth
of whole taxonomy.

to an understanding of many properties of different classes of young neutron
stars, in particular a natural explanation for the period clustering of AXPs,

determined by the dipole component of the magnetic field. The natural
possibility that magnetars and other neutron stars may have different strengths
of the dipole and higher multipole components of the magnetic field is now
actually required by observations on the spindown rates of some magnetars. This
talk gives a broad overview and some applications of the fallback disk model to
particular neutron stars. Salient points are: (i) A fallback disk has already
been observed around the AXP 4U 0142+61 some years ago. (ii) The low observed
spindown rate of the SGR 0418+5729 provides direct evidence that the dipole
component of the field is in the $10^{12} G$ range. All properties of the SGR
0418+5729 at its present age can be explained by spindown under torques from a
fallback disk. (iii) The anomalous braking index of PSR J1734-3333 can also be
explained by the fallback disk model which gives the luminosity, period, period
derivative and the period second derivative at the present age. (iv) These and
all applications to a variety of other sources employ the same disk physics and
evolution, differing only in the initial conditions of the disk.

obtain a bootstrap sample in the time domain. Related previous proposals, such
as the ""surrogate data"" approach, resampled only the phase of the Fourier
coefficients and thus had only limited validity. By contrast, we show that the
appropriate resampling of phase and magnitude, in addition to some smoothing of
Fourier coefficients, yields a bootstrap scheme that mimics the correct
second-order moment structure for a large class of time series processes. As a
main result we obtain a functional limit theorem for the TFT-bootstrap under a
variety of popular ways of frequency domain bootstrapping. Possible
applications of the TFT-bootstrap naturally arise in change-point analysis and
unit-root testing where statistics are frequently based on functionals of
partial sums. Finally, a small simulation study explores the potential of the
TFT-bootstrap for small samples showing that for the discussed tests in
change-point analysis as well as unit-root testing, it yields better results
than the corresponding asymptotic tests if measured by size and power.

three confirmed novae and three SSSs have been discovered in globular clusters

were found in M 31 GCs. To study the SSS state of CNe we carried out a
high-cadence X-ray monitoring of the M 31 central area with XMM-Newton and
Chandra. We analysed X-ray and optical data of a new transient X-ray source in
the M 31 GC Bol 126, discovered serendipitously in Swift observations. Our
optical data set was based on regular M 31 monitoring programmes from five
different small telescopes. Additionally, we made use of Pan-STARRS 1 data
obtained during the PAndromeda survey. Our observations reveal that the X-ray
source in Bol 126 is the third SSS in an M 31 GC and can be confirmed as the
second CN in the M 31 GC system. This nova is named M31N 2010-10f. Its
properties in the X-ray and optical regimes agree with a massive white dwarf
(M_WD >~ 1.3 M_sun) in the binary system. Incorporating the data on previously
found (suspected) novae in M 31 GCs we used our high-cadence X-ray monitoring
observations to estimate a tentative nova rate in the M 31 GC system of 0.05
/yr/GC. An optical estimate, based on the recent 10.5-year WeCAPP survey, gives
a lower nova rate, which is compatible with the X-ray rate on the 95%
confidence level. There is growing evidence that the nova rate in GCs is higher
than expected from primordial binary formation and under conditions as in the
field. Dynamical binary formation and/or additional accretion from the
intracluster medium are possible scenarios for an increased nova rate, but
observational confirmation for this enhancement has been absent, so far.
Regular X-ray monitoring observations of M 31 provide a promising strategy to
find these novae.

structural rearrangement occurs within the superlattice. We find that at the
interface the RuO6 octahedra get elongated for the Sr2RuO4 while tend to be
compressed for the Sr3Ru2O7 as compared to inner layers and the bulk phases.
The positions of the Sr-atoms in the Sr-O layers at the interface are strongly
modified and influence the alignment of the Ru atoms with respect to the planar
oxygens as well as the Ru-O-Ru in-plane bond angles. Such structural
rearrangement leads to a modification of the electronic structure close to the
Fermi level. The main changes occurring at the interface and in the inner
layers of the heterostructure are analyzed and compared with the bulk phases of
the Sr2RuO4 and Sr3Ru2O7 compounds. We show that the positions of the peaks in
the density of states close to the Fermi levels get shifted and renormalized in
the spectral weight. The balance between the renormalization of the bandwidth
of the dxy band and that of the crystal field splitting results into a minor
change of the Van Hove singularities position within the superlattice. The
effective tight-binding parameters for the 4d Ru bands are determined by means
of a maximally localized Wannier functions approach and used to discuss the
modification of the electronic structure of the superlattice with respect to

and radio observations. Optical data from the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line
Survey (MCELS) and new radio data from the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis
Telescope (MOST), in addition to the ROSAT X-ray data, were used to perform a
morphological analysis of this candidate SNR. An approximately ellipsoidal
shell of enhanced [SII], typical of an SNR ([SII]/Halpha > 0.4), was detected
in the optical. This enhancement is coincident with faint radio emission at 36
cm. Using the available data we estimated the size of the remnant to be ~5.1' x
4.0' (~75 pc x 59 pc). However, the measurement along the major-axis was
somewhat uncertain due to a lack of optical and radio emission at its
extremities and the poor resolution of the X-ray data. Assuming this SNR is in
the Sedov phase and adopting the ambient mass density of 1.2x10^-25 g cm^-3
measured in a nearby HII region, an age estimate of ~25 kyr was calculated for
a canonical initial explosion energy of 10^51 erg. However, this age estimate
should be treated cautiously due to uncertainties on the adopted parameters.
Analysis of the local stellar population suggested a type Ia event as a
precursor to this SNR, however, a core-collapse mechanism could not be ruled
out due to the possibility of the progenitor being a runaway massive star. With
the detection of X-ray, radio and optical line emission with enhanced [SII],
this object was confirmed as an SNR and we assign the identifier MCSNR

on \psi' production in dAu collisions at sqrt{s}=200 GeV, which show a strong
suppression for central collisions, 5 times larger than the one obtained for
J/\psi\ production at the same energy. We conclude that none of the

and 86 in the field environment) in the region of the Abell 901/902 multiple
cluster system, which is located at a redshift of $z\sim 0.165$. The presence
of substructures and non-Gaussian redshift distributions indicate that the
cluster system is dynamically young and not in a virialized state. We find
evidence for two important galaxy populations. \textit{Morphologically
distorted galaxies} are probably subject to increased tidal interactions. They
show pronounced rotation curve asymmetries at intermediate cluster-centric
radii and low rest-frame peculiar velocities. \textit{Morphologically
undistorted galaxies} show the strongest rotation curve asymmetries at high
rest-frame velocities and low cluster-centric radii. Supposedly, this group is
strongly affected by ram-pressure stripping due to interaction with the
intra-cluster medium. Among the morphologically undistorted galaxies, dusty red
galaxies have particularly strong rotation curve asymmetries, suggesting ram
pressure is an important factor in these galaxies. Furthermore, dusty red
galaxies on average have a bulge-to-total ratio higher by a factor of two than
cluster blue cloud and field galaxies. The fraction of kinematically distorted
galaxies is 75% higher in the cluster than in the field environment. This
difference mainly stems from morphological undistorted galaxies, indicating a
cluster-specific interaction process that only affects the gas kinematics but
not the stellar morphology. Also the ratio between gas and stellar scale length
is reduced for cluster galaxies compared to the field sample. Both findings
could be best explained by ram-pressure effects.

corresponds to quasars sight lines. For the post reionization 21-cm signal we
have used a linear bias model. We use a Fisher matrix analysis to present the
first prediction for bounds on f_{NL} and the other bias parameters using the
three dimensional 21-cm bispectrum and other cross bispectra. The bounds on
f_{NL} depend on the survey volume, and the various observational noises. We
have considered a BOSS like Ly-alpha survey where the average number density of
quasars \bar{n} = 10^{-3} Mpc^{-2} and the spectra are measured at a 2-sigma

possible to constrain f_{NL} at a level \Delta f_{NL} ~ 4.7. For the
equilateral and orthogonal template we obtain \Delta f_{NL}^{equ}~17 and \Delta
f_{NL}^{orth}~13 respectively for the combined estimator. This shall be

not follow the predicted trajectories of isolated ring particles moving under
the influence of Saturn's and Pan's gravitational fields. We also examine the
orbital properties of these ringlets by comparing images taken at different

gravitational perturbations from Pan, and collisions among the ring particles.

synthesized using texture and depth videos of the anchor views via
depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). In general, the distortion of the virtual
view increases with the distance to the anchor views, and hence it is
beneficial for a peer to select the closest anchor views for synthesis. On the
other hand, if peers interested in different virtual views are willing to
tolerate larger distortion in using more distant anchor views, they can
collectively share the access cost of common anchor views.
  Given anchor view access cost and synthesized distortion of virtual views
between anchor views, we study the optimization of anchor view allocation for
collaborative peers. We first show that, if the network reconfiguration costs
due to view-switching are negligible, the problem can be optimally solved in
polynomial time using dynamic programming. We then consider the case of
non-negligible reconfiguration costs (e.g., large or frequent view-switching
leading to anchor-view changes). In this case, the view allocation problem
becomes NP-hard. We thus present a locally optimal and centralized allocation
algorithm inspired by Lloyd's algorithm in non-uniform scalar quantization. We
also propose a distributed algorithm with guaranteed convergence where each

rate of heat transfer to the free state, suppression of energy exchange is
observed. Comparison with a Fermi's golden rule prediction confirms that this
effect is caused by a dispersion mismatch that reduces the phase space
available for elastic collisions. This result has critical implications for
methods proposed to cool strongly correlated lattice gases.

functions, as estimated by full-counting statistics, allow to identify
dynamical phases, i.e. phases with specific fluctuation properties of
time-integrated observables, and to locate the transitions between these
phases. We discuss in detail the case of the quantum Ising chain in a
transverse field. We show that this model displays a continuum of quantum
dynamical transitions, of which the static transition is just an end point.
These singularities are not a consequence of particular choices of initial
conditions or other external non-equilibrium protocols such as quenches in

  While $^{13}$CO is in general dominated by residual emission from the cloud,
CN exhibits a high disk detection rate $> 50$% in our sample. We even report CN
detection in stars for which interferometric searches failed to detect
$^{12}$CO, presumably because of obscuration by a foreground, optically thick,
cloud. Comparison between CN and o-H$_2$CO or SO line profiles and intensities
divide the sample in two main categories. Sources with SO emission are bright
and have strong H$_2$CO emission, leading in general to [H$_2$CO/CN]$ > 0.5$.
Furthermore, their line profiles, combined with a priori information on the
objects, suggest that the emission is coming from outflows or envelopes rather
than from a circumstellar disk. On the other hand, most sources have
[H$_2$CO/CN]$ < 0.3$, no SO emission, and some of them exhibit clear
double-peaked profiles characteristics of rotating disks. In this second
category, CN is likely tracing the proto-planetary disks. From the line flux
and opacity derived from the hyperfine ratios, we constrain the outer radii of
the disks, which range from 300 to 600 AU. The overall gas disk detection rate
(including all molecular tracers) is $\sim 68%$, and decreases for fainter

explanation for this discrepancy has been suggested: the ratio of the beam size

influence the observed Mg II equivalent width, if these two sizes are
comparable. Aims: We investigate whether the differing beam sizes of the

Results: We see no difference in the sight-line number density of strong Mg II

lower limit of the order of 10^17} cm for the characteristic size of a Mg II

probe; the spectral response is recorded, and then evaluated with a
mathematical model to obtain information on the electron density and other

diagnostics technique in terms of a general description based on functional

addresses traffic-derived emissions as side constraints. We seek to tackle this
problem using a mixed integer mathematical programming approach. Such a class
of problems, which we call LWR-Emission (LWR-E), has been analyzed before to
certain extent. Since mixed integer programs are practically efficient to solve
in many cases (Bertsimas et al., 2011b), the mere fact of having integer
variables is not the most significant challenge to solving LWR-E problems;
rather, it is the presence of the potentially nonlinear and nonconvex
emission-related constraints/objectives that render the program computationally
expensive. To address this computational challenge, we proposed a novel
reformulation of the LWR-E problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP).
This approach relies on the existence of a statistically valid macroscopic
relationship between the aggregate emission rate and the vehicle occupancy of
the same link. This relationship is approximated with certain functional forms
and the associated uncertainties are handled explicitly using robust
optimization (RO) techniques. The RO allows emissions-related constraints
and/or objectives to be reformulated as linear forms under mild conditions. To
further reduce the computational cost, we employ the link transmission model to
describe traffic dynamics with the benefit of fewer (integer) variables and
less potential traffic holding. The proposed MILP explicitly captures vehicle
spillback, avoids traffic holding, and simultaneously minimizes travel delay
and addresses emission-related concerns.

the Dirichlet beta function, euler numbers and pi, reveals a new evidence about
the self-recursive nature of Riemann zeta function at odd integers. We
demonstrate for the first time that the Riemann zeta function at odd integers
always produces a recurrence relation that is self-recursive.

  Decomposition/Demodulation of AM-FM images",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The synchrosqueezing method aims at decomposing 1D functions as
superpositions of a small number of ""Intrinsic Modes"", supposed to be well
separated both in time and frequency. Based on the unidimensional wavelet
transform and its reconstruction properties, the synchrosqueezing transform
provides a powerful representation of multicomponent signals in the
time-frequency plane, together with a reconstruction of each mode.
  In this paper, a bidimensional version of the synchrosqueezing transform is
defined, by considering a well-adapted extension of the concept of analytic
signal to images: the monogenic signal. The natural bidimensional counterpart
of the notion of Intrinsic Mode is then the concept of ""Intrinsic Monogenic
Mode"" that we define. Thereafter, we investigate the properties of its
associated Monogenic Wavelet Decomposition. This leads to a natural bivariate
extension of the Synchrosqueezed Wavelet Transform, for decomposing and
processing multicomponent images. Numerical tests validate the effectiveness of
the method for different examples.

in global economies. We investigate the statistical properties of the
recurrence intervals of daily volatility time series of four NYMEX energy
futures, which are defined as the waiting times $\tau$ between consecutive
volatilities exceeding a given threshold $q$. We find that the recurrence
intervals are distributed as a stretched exponential $P_q(\tau)\sim
e^{(a\tau)^{-\gamma}}$, where the exponent $\gamma$ decreases with increasing
$q$, and there is no scaling behavior in the distributions for different
thresholds $q$ after the recurrence intervals are scaled with the mean
recurrence interval $\bar\tau$. These findings are significant under the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Cram{\'e}r-von Mises test. We show that
empirical estimations are in nice agreement with the numerical integration
results for the occurrence probability $W_q(\Delta{t}|t)$ of a next event above
the threshold $q$ within a (short) time interval after an elapsed time $t$ from
the last event above $q$. We also investigate the memory effects of the
recurrence intervals. It is found that the conditional distributions of large
and small recurrence intervals differ from each other and the conditional mean
of the recurrence intervals scales as a power law of the preceding interval
$\bar\tau(\tau_0)/\bar\tau \sim (\tau_0/\bar\tau)^\beta$, indicating that the
recurrence intervals have short-term correlations. Detrended fluctuation
analysis and detrending moving average analysis further uncover that the
recurrence intervals possess long-term correlations. We confirm that the
""clustering"" of the volatility recurrence intervals is caused by the long-term
correlations well known to be present in the volatility.

  Renaud","A fields only version of the Lorentz Force Law: Particles replaced by
  their fields","9 pages, 2 figues",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that the Lorentz force law, F^L_1=q_1(E+v_1xB) being the charge on
particle 1 interacting with the electromagnetic fields due to all other
particles, can be written in a pure field form F^L_1=-\nabla_1 U^{EM}. In this
expression U^{EM} is the total electromagnetic energy of the system of particle
1 and all other particles. In deriving this result we review the old but not
widely known results that Maxwell's equations follow uniquely from Special
Relativity, and that the Lorentz force law follows from applying Hamilton's
variational principle to this result.
  For a two particle system, the standard view is that the electromagnetic
force on particle 1 is the result of the charge of particle 1 interacting
locally with the field of particle 2, and conversely. Both charges 1 and 2, and
fields 1 and 2 are needed. In our approach, the fields of all particles
contribute to the electromagnetic interaction everywhere, over all of space.
The charges of the particles do not enter the theory except incidentally, via
Gauss's law. This has novel interpretational consequences. In particular, it
allows a charged particle to be replaced by its electric and magnetic fields,
much as a particle in quantum mechanics is replaced by its complex valued
wavefunction.
