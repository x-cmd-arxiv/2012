using high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) Spitzer IRS Neon forbidden line

report three new detections of [Ne III] from CS Cha, SZ Cha, and T 54, doubling
the known number of [Ne III] detections from TTS. Using [Ne III]-to-[Ne II]
ratios in conjunction with X-ray emission measurements, we probe high-energy
radiation from TTS. The majority of previously inferred [Ne III]/[Ne II] ratios
based on [Ne III] line upper limits are significantly less than 1, pointing to
the dominance of either X-ray radiation or soft Extreme-Ultraviolet (EUV)
radiation in producing these lines. Here we report the first observational
evidence for hard EUV dominated Ne forbidden line production in a T Tauri disk:
[Ne III]/[Ne II]~1 in SZ Cha. Our results provide a unique insight into the EUV
emission from TTS, by suggesting that EUV radiation may dominate the creation
of Ne forbidden lines, albeit in a minority of cases.

for the identification and biological interpretation of classes of genes, such
as the Gene Ontology. The information accumulated time-by-time and included in
the GO is encoded in the definition of terms and in the setting up of semantic
relations amongst terms. This approach might be usefully complemented by a
bottom-up approach based on the knowledge of relationships amongst genes. To
this end, we investigate the Gene Ontology from a complex network perspective.
We consider the semantic network of terms naturally associated with the
semantic relationships provided by the Gene Ontology consortium and a
gene-based weighted network in which the nodes are the terms and a link between
any two terms is set up whenever genes are annotated in both terms. One aim of
the present paper is to understand whether the semantic and the gene-based
network share the same structural properties or not. We then consider network
communities. The identification of communities in the SVNs network can
therefore be the basis of a simple protocol aiming at fully exploiting the
possible relationships amongst terms, thus improving the knowledge of the
semantic structure of GO. This is also important from a biomedical point of
view, as it might reveal how genes over-expressed in a certain term also affect
other biological functions not directly linked by the GO semantics. As a
by-product, we present a simple methodology that allows to have a first glance
insight about the biological characterization of groups of GO terms.

density, and proton fraction.
  Methods: A new lattice-gas model, the ""Charged-Ising Model"" (CIM), is
introduced to simulate the behavior of neutron-star matter. Preliminary Monte
Carlo simulations on 30^3 lattices are performed for a variety of temperatures,
densities, and proton fractions.
  Results: Results are obtained for the heat capacity, pair-correlation

  Conclusions: Although relatively simple, the CIM captures the essence of
Coulomb frustration that is required to simulate the subtle dynamics of the
inner stellar crust. Moreover, the computationally demanding long-range Coulomb
interactions have been pre-computed at the appropriate lattice sites prior to
the start of the simulation resulting in enormous computational gains. This

the x axis and under-estimation on the y axis. The curves are just drawn by
adjusting a shift, a constant that is added (or subtracted) to the predictions,
and plays a similar role as a threshold in classification. From here, we
develop the notions of optimal operating condition, convexity, dominance, and
explore several evaluation metrics that can be shown graphically, such as the
area over the RROC curve (AOC). In particular, we show a novel and significant
result, the AOC is equal to the error variance (multiplied by a factor which
does not depend on the model). The derivation of RROC curves with non-constant
shifts and soft regression models, and the relation with cost plots is also

treating it as a constraint on the wave function of a system, a linear
evolution equation for the wave function is obtained from the Lagrange
multiplier method. It allows us to define the microscopic response to a
velocity gradient in a pure state. Taking a spatial coarse-graining average
over this microscopic response and averaging it over admissible initial states,
we achieve the observed macroscopic response and transport coefficient. In this
scheme, temporal coarse-graining is not needed. The dissipation caused by a
velocity gradient depends on the square of initial occupation probability,

that all of these factors can lead to different selection pressures but has
only recently attempted to synthesize how these factors interact. Using models

factors in a consistent framework reveals that they interact with one another
in ways previously overlooked. Specifically, behavioral responses
(reciprocity), genetic relatedness, and synergy interact in non-trivial ways
that cannot be easily captured by simple summary indices of assortment. We
demonstrate the importance of these interactions by showing how they have been
neglected in previous synthetic models of social behavior both within and
between species. These interactions also affect the level of behavioral
responses that can evolve in the long run; proximate biological mechanisms are
evolutionarily stable when they generate enough responsiveness relative to the
level of responsiveness that exactly balances the ecological costs and
benefits. Given the richness of social behavior across taxa, these interactions
should be a boon for empirical research as they are likely crucial for
describing the complex relationship linking ecology, demography, and social

teleportation may be improved by the strong backaction of the non-Markovian
memory effects of the reservoir. The physical mechanism responsible for this
improvement are determined.

derived from the intensities at 100 and 140 \mu m with a spatial resolution of
5'. The intensity at 140 \mu m was derived from the intensities at 60 and 100
\mu m of the IRAS data assuming two tight correlations between the intensities
at 60, 100, and 140 \mu m of the COBE/DIRBE data. We found that these
correlations can be separated into two correlations by the antenna temperature
of the radio continuum at 41 GHz.
  Because the present study can trace the 5'-scale spatial variation in the
dust temperature distribution, it has an advantage over the extinction map
derived by Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis, who used the DIRBE maps to derive
dust temperature distribution with a spatial resolution of 1 degrees. We
estimated the accuracy of our method by comparing it with that of Schlegel,
Finkbeiner, and Davis. The spatial resolution difference was found to be
significant. The area in which the significant difference is confirmed occupies
28% of the region for |\beta| > 30 degrees.
  With respect to the estimation of extragalactic reddening, the present study
has an advantage over the extinction map derived by Dobashi (2011), which was
based on the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, because our extinction map is derived
on the basis of far-infrared emission. Dobashi's extinction map exhibits a
maximum value that is lower than that of our map in the galactic plane and a
signal-to-noise ratio that is lower than that of our map in high galactic
latitudes. This significant difference is confirmed in 81% of the region for
|\beta| > 30 degrees.
  In the areas where the significant differences are confirmed, the extinction
should be estimated using our method rather than the previous methods.

the reconstruction of the spectrum magnitude on the entire UV plane from the
measured visibility magnitude on a limited set of points and the reconstruction
of the sought-for image of the source by Fienup's error-reduction iterative
algorithm from the spectrum magnitude reconstructed at the first stage. It is
shown that the technique used ensures unique solution (within a class of
equivalent functions) for AGNs with typical structure morphology ""bright core +
week jet"". The method proposed can be used, for example, for imaging with
ultra-high resolution using a space{ground radio interferometer with a space
antenna in a very high orbit (""RadioAstron""). In this case, a multi-element
interferometer essentially degenerates into a two-element interferometer and
the degeneracy of the close-phase relations prevents the use of standard
methods for hybrid mapping and self-calibration. The capabilities and
restrictions of the method are demonstrated on a number of model experiments.
For a few selected AGNs the images are obtained from VLBA observations.

band at 11.3 {\mu}m is selectively enhanced at the southern part of the nebula.
The variation can be explained by a difference in the amount of the UV
radiation to excite PAHs, and does not necessarily require the chemical
processing of dust grains and PAHs. It suggests that the UV self-extinction is
important to understand the mid-infrared spectral features. We propose a

it is important to find a methodology to recover these data in case of failure

distributions calibrated to absolute units, stellar parallaxes, high-resolution

self-consistent atmospheric models assuming normal and depleted helium

elements. The effective temperatures and surface gravities are found from the
simultaneous fit to spectroscopic, photometric, and spectrophotometric

method uses two mappings in a finite field: the Frobenius map and the cyclic

form an automorphism group of the Steiner structure. Using this method,
assisted by an exact-cover computer search, we explicitly generate a Steiner

electronic commerce. Retailers in Saudi Arabia have been reserved in their
adoption of electronically delivered aspects of their business. Despite the
fact that Saudi Arabia has the largest and fastest growth of ICT marketplaces
in the Arab region, ecommerce activities are not progressing at the same speed.
Only a tiny number of Saudi commercial organizations, mostly medium and large
companies from the manufacturing sector, are involved in e-commerce
implementation. Based on qualitative data, collected by conducting interviews
with a sample population of retail sector decision makers in Saudi Arabia, both
positive and negative issues influencing retailer adoption of electronic
retailing systems in Saudi Arabia are identified. A number of impediments which
include cultural, business and technical issues were reported. Facilitating
factors include access to educational programs and awareness building of
e-commerce, government support and assistance for ecommerce, trustworthy and
secure online payment options, developing strong ICT infrastructure, and
provision of sample e-commerce software to trial. While literature reveals that
government promotion has had limited effects on the diffusion of e-commerce in
most countries, this study significantly indicates government promotion and
support as a key driver to online retailing in KSA.

the world and 4th in the Gulf region in eGovernment readiness according to
United Nations reports. In particular, Saudi Arabia has ranked 75th worldwide
for its online service index and its components compared to the neighbouring
Gulf country of Bahrain, which was ranked 8th for the same index. While this is
still modest in relation to the Saudi government expectation concerning its
vision for eGovernment implementation for 2010, and the results achieved by the
neighbouring Gulf countries such as Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates on the
eGovernment index, the Saudi government has endeavoured to meet the public
needs concerning eGovernment and carry out the implementation of eGovernment
properly. Governments may heed the importance of actively launching official
government websites as the main portals for delivering their online services to
all the different categories of eGovernment (including G2C, G2B, and G2G).
However, certain Saudi ministries have not given due attention to this vital
issue. This is evidenced by the fact that some of their websites are not fully
developed or do not yet exist, which clearly impedes that particular ministry
from appropriately delivering eServices.

survey detected 62 sources with 95 GHz methanol masers above 3$\sigma$
detection limit, which include 47 high-mass sources and 15 low-mass sources.
Therefore the detection rate is 38% for high-mass outflow sources and 9% for
low-mass outflow sources, suggesting that class I methanol maser is relatively
easily excited in high-mass sources. There are 37 newly detected 95 GHz
methanol masers (including 27 high-mass and 10 low-mass sources), 19 of which

maser detection efficiency increases with outflow properties (e.g. mass,

Systematic investigations of relationships between the intrinsic luminosity of
methanol maser and the outflow properties (including mass, momentum, kinetic
energy, bolometric luminosity and mass loss rate of central stellar sources)
indicate a positive correlations. This further supports that class I methanol
masers are collisionally pumped and associated with shocks, where outflows
interact with the surrounding ambient medium.

of various stars, including the Sun, as a more general physical rather than a
purely astronomical problem. We try to identify resonances which are expected
to occur when a mean-field dynamo excites waves of quasi-stationary magnetic
field in two distinct spherical layers. We isolate some features that can be
associated with resonances in the profiles of energy or frequency plotted
versus a dynamo governing parameter. Rather unexpectedly however the resonances
in spherical dynamos take a much less spectacular form than resonances in many
more familiar branches of physics. In particular, we find that the magnitudes
of resonant phenomena are much smaller than seem detectable by astronomical
observations, and plausibly any related effects in laboratory dynamo
experiments (which of course are not in gravitating spheres!) are also small.
We discuss specific features relevant to resonant phenomena in spherical
dynamos, and find parametric resonance to be the most pronounced type of
resonance phenomena. Resonance conditions for these dynamo wave resonances are
rather different from those for more conventional branches of physics. We
suggest that the relative insignificance of the phenomenon in this case is
because the phenomena of excitation and propagation of the activity waves are
not well-separated from each other and this, together with the nonlinear nature
of more-or-less realistic dynamos, suppress the resonances and makes them much
less pronounced than resonant effects, for example in optics.

linear combination of the basis functions. Several possible extensions of the
method to resonance states have been considered in the literature. Here we
propose the application of the optimized Rayleigh-Ritz method to this end. The
method uses a basis of the functions containing adjustable nonlinear
parameters, the values of which are fixed so as to make the trace of the
variational matrix stationary. Generalization to resonances proceeds by
allowing the parameters to be complex numbers. Using various basis sets, we
demonstrate that the optimized Rayleigh-Ritz scheme with complex parameters
provides an effective algorithm for the determination of both the energy and
lifetime of the resonant states for various one-dimensional and spherically
symmetric potentials. The method is computationally inexpensive since it does
not require iterations or predetermined initial values. The convergence rate
compares favorably to other approaches.

Chebyshev distance are examined within the framework of idempotent algebra. The
aim of the study is twofold: first, to give a new algebraic solution to the
location problems, and second, to extend the area of application of idempotent
algebra. A new algebraic approach based on investigation of extremal properties
of eigenvalues for irreducible matrices is developed to solve multidimensional
problems that involve minimization of functionals defined on idempotent vector
semimodules. Furthermore, an unconstrained location problem is considered and
then represented in the idempotent algebra settings. A new algebraic solution
is given that reduces the problem to evaluation of the eigenvalue and
eigenvectors of an appropriate matrix. Finally, the solution is extended to
solve a constrained location problem.

understanding the basic ingredients of the mean-field dynamo theory. The
discussion includes the recent analytic and numerical work in developments for
the mean electromotive force of the turbulent flows and magnetic field, the
nonlinear effects of the magnetic helicity, the non-local generation effects in
the dynamo. We give an example of the mean-field solar dynamo model that
incorporates the fairly complete expressions for the mean-electromotive force,
the subsurface shear layer and the conservation of the total helicity. The
model is used to shed light on the issues in the solar dynamo and on the future
development of this field of research.

flip in the involving quark states thus the breaking of chiral $U(3)_{Q}\times
U(3)_{d}$. On the other hand, the $b$-quark mass generation is also a
consequence of chiral $U(3)_{Q}\times U(3)_{d}$ symmetry breaking. Therefore,
in many models, there might be strong correlation between the $b\to s\gamma$
and $b$ quark Yukawa coupling. We use non-decoupling MSSM model to illustrate
this feature. The light Higgs boson may evade the direct search experiments at
LEPII or Tevatron while the 125 GeV Higgs-like boson is identified as the heavy
Higgs boson in the spectrum. A light charged Higgs is close to the heavy Higgs
boson which is of 125 GeV and its contribution to $b\to s \gamma$ requires
large supersymmetric correction with large PQ and $R$ symmetry breaking. The
large supersymmetric contribution at the same time significantly modifies the
$b$ quark Yukawa co upling. With combined flavor constraints $B\to X_{s}\gamma$
and $B_{s}\to \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ and direct constraints on Higgs properties, we
find best fit scenarios with light stop of $\cal O$(500 GeV), negative $A_{t}$
around -750 GeV and large $\mu$-term of 2-3 TeV. In addition, reduction in
$b\bar{b}$ partial width may also result in large enhancement of $\tau\tau$
decay branching fraction. Large parameter region in the survival space under
all bounds may be further constrained by $H\to \tau\tau$ if no excess of
$\tau\tau$ is confirmed at LHC. We only identify a small parameter region with
significant $H\to hh$ decay that is consistent with all bounds and reduced
$\tau\tau$ decay branching fraction.

  Here I propose the method for precision measuring masses and spin of
$D$-particles via the study of energy distribution of single lepton ($e$ or
$\mu$) in the process $\epe\to D^+D^-\to DDW^+W^-$ with the observable states
{\it dijet + lepton} ($\mu$ or $e$) + {\it nothing}. To determine precisely
masses of $D$ and $D^\pm$, it is sufficient to measure the singular points in
the lepton energy distributions (upper edge and kinks or peak). After this,
even a rough measuring of corresponding cross section allows to determine the
spin of $D$ particles.
  This approach is free from the difficulties of a well-known methods of
measuring the masses via the edges of the energy distribution of dijets,
representing $W$, which obliged by inaccuracies in measuring the energies of
individual jets.
