consisting of a white dwarf and a main sequence companion. Thermonuclear
runaways on the surface of massive white dwarfs, consisting of oxygen and neon,
are believed to reach peak temperatures of several hundred million kelvin.
These temperatures are strongly correlated with the underlying white dwarf
mass. The observational counterparts of such models are likely associated with
outbursts that show strong spectral lines of neon in their shells (neon novae).
The goals of this work are to investigate how useful elemental abundances are
for constraining the peak temperatures achieved during these outbursts and
determine how robust ""nova thermometers"" are with respect to uncertain nuclear
physics input. We present updated observed abundances in neon novae and perform
a series of hydrodynamic simulations for several white dwarf masses. We find
that the most useful thermometers, N/O, N/Al, O/S, S/Al, O/Na, Na/Al, O/P, and
P/Al, are those with the steepest monotonic dependence on peak temperature. The
sensitivity of these thermometers to thermonuclear reaction rate variations is
explored using post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations. The ratios N/O,
N/Al, O/Na, and Na/Al are robust, meaning they are minimally affected by
uncertain rates. However, their dependence on peak temperature is relatively
weak. The ratios O/S, S/Al, O/P, and P/Al reveal strong dependences on
temperature and the poorly known 30P(p,g)31S rate. We compare our model
predictions to neon nova observations and obtain the following estimates for
the underlying white dwarf masses: 1.34-1.35 solar masses (V838 Her), 1.18-1.21

a century long investigation, paved with successes and failures. From the
energetic point of view, supernova remnants (SNRs) remain the most plausible
sources of CRs up to rigidity ? 10^6-10^7 GV. This confidence somehow resulted
in the construction of a paradigm, the so-called SNR paradigm: CRs are
accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration in SNRs and propagate
diffusively in the Galaxy in an energy dependent way. Qualitative confirmation
of the SNR acceleration scenario has recently been provided by gamma ray and
X-ray observations. Diffusive propagation in the Galaxy is probed
observationally through measurement of the secondary to primary nuclei flux
ratios (such as B/C). There are however some weak points in the paradigm, which
suggest that we are probably missing some physical ingredients in our models.
The theory of diffusive shock acceleration at SNR shocks predicts spectra of
accelerated particles which are systematically too hard compared with the ones
inferred from gamma ray observations. Moreover, hard injection spectra
indirectly imply a steep energy dependence of the diffusion coefficient in the
Galaxy, which in turn leads to anisotropy larger than the observed one.
Moreover recent measurements of the flux of nuclei suggest that the spectra
have a break at rigidity ? 200 GV, which does not sit well with the common
wisdom in acceleration and propagation. In this paper I will review these new
developments and suggest some possible implications.

Lyrae stars has changed since the availability of ultra-precise satellite
photometry as it is obtained by CoRoT and Kepler. Both stars, CoRoT 105288363

from the ground, either because of the small amplitude of the effect, or
because uninterrupted long-term monitoring was required for a detection. Not
only was it found that strong and irregular cycle-to-cycle changes of the
Blazhko effect can occur, and that seemingly chaotic phenomena need to be
accounted for when modeling the Blazhko effect, but also a rich spectrum of
low-amplitude frequencies was detected in addition to the fundamental radial
pusation in RRab stars. The so-called period doubling phenomenon, higher radial
overtones and possibly also non-radial modes make RR Lyrae stars more
multifaceted than previously thought. This article presents the various aspects
of irregularity of the Blazhko effect, questioning its long-standing definition
as a ""periodic modulation"", and also discusses the low-amplitude pulsation

effect (SZE). We study the spectral and spatial properties of the non-thermal
SZE in a sample of radio galaxies and make predictions for their detectability
in both the negative and the positive part of the SZE, with space experiments
like Planck, OLIMPO, and Herschel-SPIRE. These cover a wide range of
frequencies, from radio to sub-mm. We model the SZE in a general formalism that
is equivalent to the relativistic covariant one and describe the electron
population contained in the lobes of the radio galaxies with parameters derived
from their radio observations, namely, flux, spectral index, and spatial
extension. We further constrain the electron spectrum and the magnetic field of
the RG lobes using X-ray, gamma-ray, and microwave archival observations. We
determine the main spectral features of the SZE in RG lobes, namely, the
minimum, the crossover, and the maximum of the SZE. We show that these typical
spectral features fall in the frequency ranges probed by the available space
experiments. We provide the most reliable predictions for the amplitude and
spectral shape of the SZE in a sample of selected RGs with extended lobes. In
three of these objects, we also derive an estimate of the magnetic field in the
lobe at the muG level by combining radio (synchrotron) observations and X-ray
(ICS) observations. These data, together with the WMAP upper limits, set
constraints on the minimum momentum of the electrons residing in the RG lobes
and allow realistic predictions for the visibility of their SZE to be derived
with Planck, OLIMPO, and Herschel-SPIRE. [abridged]

framework for the description of relativistic electrons in external fields.
This nonlinear model takes into account the infinitely many virtual electrons
of Dirac's vacuum as well as the Coulomb interactions between all the
particles. The state of the system is an infinite-rank projection satisfying a
nonlinear equation. In this paper, we construct solutions to this equation, in
the regime of weak interactions (that is, small coupling constant $\alpha$),
and strong external fields (that is, large atomic charge $Z$ such that $\alpha
Z:=\kappa$ stays fixed). In this regime, we are able to remove the ultraviolet
cut-off $\Lambda$ as soon as $\alpha\log\Lambda$ stays fixed. As an application
of this result, we compare the critical strength $\kappa_c(\alpha)$ of the
external potential needed to produce an additional particle in the vacuum, when
$\alpha=0$ or $\alpha>0$. We prove that
$\lim_{\alpha\to0}\kappa_c(\alpha)/\kappa_c(0)> 1$, and we identify the limit
exactly. Because of the dielectric behavior of Dirac's vacuum, static
electron/positron pair production occurs in the interacting case for a stronger
field that in the non-interacting case, which is a mere consequence of charge
renormalization.

region in the cluster Abell 3667. We detect a jump in the X-ray surface
brightness and X-ray temperature at the sharp outer edge of the radio relic
which indicate that this is the location of a merger shock with a Mach number
of about 2. Comparing the radio emission to the shock properties implies that
approximately 0.2% of the dissipated shock kinetic energy goes into
accelerating relativistic electrons. This is an order of magnitude smaller than
the efficiency of shock acceleration in many Galactic supernova remnants, which
may be due to the lower Mach numbers of cluster merger shocks. The X-ray and
radio properties indicate that the magnetic field strength in the radio relic
is >= 3 muG, which is a very large field at a projected distance of ~2.2 Mpc
from the center of a cluster. The radio spectrum is relatively flat at the
shock, and steepens dramatically with distance behind the shock. This is
consistent with radiative losses by the electrons and the post-shock speed
determined from the X-ray properties. The Cygnus A radio source is located in a
merging cluster of galaxies. This appears to be an early-stage merger. Our
recent Suzaku observation confirm the presence of a hot region between the two
subclusters which agrees with the predicted shocked region. The high spectral
resolution of the CCDs on Suzaku allowed us to measure the radial component of

the design of the Large Hadron Electron Collider (LHeC), which comprises its
physics programme, accelerator physics, technology and main detector concepts.
The LHeC exploits and develops challenging, though principally existing,
accelerator and detector technologies. This summary is complemented by brief
illustrations of some of the highlights of the physics programme, which relies
on a vastly extended kinematic range, luminosity and unprecedented precision in
deep inelastic scattering. Illustrations are provided regarding high precision
QCD, new physics (Higgs, SUSY) and electron-ion physics. The LHeC is designed
to run synchronously with the LHC in the twenties and to achieve an integrated
luminosity of O(100) fb$^{-1}$. It will become the cleanest high resolution
microscope of mankind and will substantially extend as well as complement the
investigation of the physics of the TeV energy scale, which has been enabled by
the LHC.

lifetime histograms of the isolated internetwork and magnetic Ca II H BPs were
determined. Mean values were found to be 2.2 km/s, 0.2 arcsec (150 km), 1.48
average Ca II H quiet-Sun and 673 sec, respectively. Interestingly, the
brightness and the horizontal velocity of BPs are anti-correlated. Large
excursions (pulses) in horizontal velocity, up to 15 km/s, are present in the
trajectories of most BPs. These could excite kink waves travelling into the
chromosphere and possibly the corona, which we estimate to carry an energy flux
of 310 W/m^2, sufficient to heat the upper layers, although only marginally.
The stable observing conditions of Sunrise and our technique for identifying
and tracking BPs have allowed us to determine reliable parameters of these
features in the internetwork. Thus we find, e.g., that they are considerably
longer lived than previously thought. The large velocities are also reliable,
and may excite kink waves. Although these wave are (marginally) energetic
enough to heat the quiet corona, we expect a large additional contribution from
larger magnetic elements populating the network and partly also the
internetwork.

evolutionary state (even if this is not the sole factor governing the presence
of BALs), it is expected that they should show an excess of mid-infrared
radiation compared to normal quasars. Some previous studies have suggested that
this is not the case. We perform the first analysis of the IR properties of
radio-loud BAL quasars, using IR data from WISE and optical (rest-frame
ultraviolet) data from SDSS, and compare the BAL quasar sample with a
well-matched sample of unabsorbed quasars. We find a statistically significant
excess in the mid- to near-infrared luminosities of BAL quasars, particularly
at rest-frame wavelengths of 1.5 and 4 microns. Our sample was previously used
to show that BALs are observed along many lines of sight towards quasars, but
with an overabundance of more edge-on sources, suggesting that orientation
factors into the appearance of BALs. The evidence here---of a difference in IR
luminosities between BAL quasars and unabsorbed quasars---may be ascribed to
evolution. This suggests that a merging of the current BAL paradigms is needed
to fully describe the class.

The main source of this mystery is the interaction between operating systems
and hardware while system's boot up and kernel initialization. In addition,
many operating system kernels differ in their behavior toward many situations.
For instance, kernels act differently in racing conditions, kernel
initialization and process scheduling. For such operations, kernel debuggers
were designed to help in tracing kernel behavior and solving many kernel bugs.
The importance of kernel debuggers is not limited to kernel code tracing but
also, they can be used in verification and performance comparisons. However,
developers had to be aware of debugger commands thus introducing some
difficulties to non-expert programmers. Later, several visual kernel debuggers
were presented to make it easier for programmers to trace their kernel code and
analyze kernel behavior. Nowadays, several kernel debuggers exist for solving
this mystery but only very few support line-by-line debugging at run-time. In
this paper, a generic approach for operating system source code debugging in
graphical mode with line-by-line tracing support is proposed. In the context of
this approach, system boot up and evaluation of two operating system schedulers
from several points of views will be discussed.

find that their infrared luminosities are completely dominated by their
secondary stars. For the two highly magnetic ""polars"" in our survey, AM Her and
EF Eri, we find that their mid-infrared excesses, previously attributed to
circumbinary dust emission, can be fully explained by cyclotron emission. The
WISE light curves for both sources show large, orbitally modulated variations
that are identically phased to their near-IR light curves. We propose that
significant emission from the lowest cyclotron harmonics (n </= 3) is present
in EF Eri and AM Her. Previously, such emission would have been presumed to be
optically thick, and not provide significant orbitally modulated flux. This
suggests that the accretion onto polars is more complicated than assumed in the
simple models developed for these two sources. We develop a model for the
near-/mid-IR light curves for WZ Sge with an L2 donor star that shows that the
ellipsoidal variations from its secondary star are detected. We conclude that
none of the targets surveyed have dusty circumbinary disks.

magnetospheric ejections (MEs) due to the expansion and reconnection of the
field lines connecting the star with the disk. Our aim is to study the
dynamical properties of the outflows and evaluate their impact on the angular
momentum evolution of young protostars. Our models are based on axisymmetric
time-dependent magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of the
dipolar magnetosphere of a rotating protostar with a viscous and resistive
disk, using alpha prescriptions for the transport coefficients. Our simulations
are designed in order to model: the accretion process and the formation of
accretion funnels; the periodic inflation/reconnection of the magnetosphere and
the associated MEs; the stellar wind. Similarly to a magnetic slingshot, MEs
can be powered by the rotation of both the disk and the star so that they can
efficiently remove angular momentum from both. Depending on the accretion rate,
MEs can extract a relevant fraction of the accretion torque and, together with
a weak but non-negligible stellar wind torque, can balance the spin-up due to
accretion. When the disk truncation approaches the corotation radius, the
system enters a ""propeller"" regime, where the torques exerted by the disk and
the MEs can even balance the spin-up due to the stellar contraction. The MEs
spin-down efficiency can be compared to other scenarios, such as the Ghosh &
Lamb, X-wind or stellar wind models. Nevertheless, for all scenarios, an
efficient spin-down torque requires a rather strong dipolar component, which
has been seldom observed in classical T Tauri stars. A better analysis of the
torques acting on the protostar must take into account non-axisymmetric and
multipolar magnetic components consistent with observations.

climate sensitivity to external forcings and sea level sensitivity to climate
change. Climate sensitivity depends on the initial climate state, but
potentially can be accurately inferred from precise paleoclimate data.
Pleistocene climate oscillations yield a fast-feedback climate sensitivity 3
+/- 1{\deg}C for 4 W/m2 CO2 forcing if Holocene warming relative to the Last
Glacial Maximum (LGM) is used as calibration, but the error (uncertainty) is
substantial and partly subjective because of poorly defined LGM global
temperature and possible human influences in the Holocene.
Glacial-to-interglacial climate change leading to the prior (Eemian)
interglacial is less ambiguous and implies a sensitivity in the upper part of
the above range, i.e., 3-4{\deg}C for 4 W/m2 CO2 forcing. Slow feedbacks,
especially change of ice sheet size and atmospheric CO2, amplify total Earth
system sensitivity by an amount that depends on the time scale considered. Ice
sheet response time is poorly defined, but we show that the slow response and
hysteresis in prevailing ice sheet models are exaggerated. We use a global
model, simplified to essential processes, to investigate state-dependence of
climate sensitivity, finding an increased sensitivity towards warmer climates,
as low cloud cover is diminished and increased water vapor elevates the
tropopause. Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make much of the
planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that
emphasize adaptation to climate change.

lensing surveys will reduce statistical errors to such an extent that
systematic errors will instead become the dominant source of uncertainty. It is
therefore crucial to devise numerical methods to measure galaxy shapes with the
least possible systematic errors. We present a simple ""forward deconvolution""
method, gfit, to measure galaxy shapes given telescope and atmospheric
smearings, in the presence of noise. The method consists in fitting a single 2D
elliptical S\'ersic profile to the data, convolved with the point spread
function. We applied gfit to the data proposed in the GRavitational lEnsing
Accuracy Testing 2010 (GREAT10) Galaxy Challenge. In spite of its simplicity,
gfit obtained the lowest additive bias
{($\sqrt{\mathcal{A}}=0.057\times10^{-4}$)} on the shear power spectrum among
twelve different methods and the second lowest multiplicative bias
{($\mathcal{M}/2=0.583\times10^{-2}$)}. It remains that gfit is a fitting
method and is therefore affected by noise bias. However, the simplicity of the
underlying galaxy model combined with the use of an efficient customized
minimization algorithm allow very competitive performances, at least on the
GREAT10 data, for a relatively low computing time.

scrutinizing its standard formulation. In classical and quantum mechanics
without gravity, there is no definition of the zero point of energy.
Furthermore, the Casimir effect only measures how the vacuum energy {\it
changes} as one varies a geometric modulus. This leads us to propose that the
physical vacuum energy in a Friedman-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker expanding
universe only depends on the time variation of the scale factor $a(t)$.
Equivalently, requiring that empty Minkowski space is gravitationally stable is
a principle that fixes the ambiguity in the zero point energy. On the other
hand, if there is a meaningful bare cosmological constant, this prescription
should be viewed as a fine-tuning.
  We describe two different choices of vacuum, one of which is consistent with
the current universe consisting only of matter and vacuum energy. The resulting
vacuum energy density $\rhovac$ is constant in time and approximately $k_c^2
H_0^2$, where $k_c$ is a momentum cut-off and $H_0$ is the current Hubble
constant; for a cut-off close to the Planck scale, values of $\rhovac$ in
agreement with astrophysical measurements are obtained. Another choice of
vacuum is more relevant to the early universe consisting of only radiation and
vacuum energy, and we suggest it as a possible model of inflation.

  Next, using similar methods we prove that every $\ell_2$-strictly singular
operator from $L_p$, $1<p<\infty$, to any Banach space with an unconditional
basis, is narrow, which partially answers a question of Plichko and Popov posed
in 1990.
  A theorem of H. P. Rosenthal asserts that if an operator $T$ on $L_1[0,1]$
satisfies the assumption that for each measurable set $A \subseteq [0,1]$ the
restriction $T \bigl|_{L_1(A)}$ is not an isomorphic embedding, then $T$ is
narrow.
  (Here $L_1(A) = \{x \in L_1: {\rm supp} \, x \subseteq A\}$.) Inspired by
this result, in the last part of the paper, we find a sufficient condition, of
a different flavor than being $\ell_2$-strictly singular, for operators on
$L_p[0,1]$, $1<p<2$, to be narrow. We define a notion of a ""gentle"" growth of a
function and we prove that for $1 < p < 2$ every operator $T$ on $L_p$ which,
for every $A\subseteq[0,1]$, sends a function of ""gentle"" growth supported on
$A$ to a function of arbitrarily small norm is narrow.

high-velocity outflows, which might be present in all quasars and could be a
major contributor to feedback to galaxy evolution. Studying the variability in
these BALs allows us to further our understanding of the structure, evolution,
and basic physical properties of the outflows. This is the third paper in a
series on a monitoring programme of 24 luminous BAL quasars at redshifts 1.2 <
z < 2.9. We focus here on the time-scales of variability in CIV 1549A BALs in
our full multi-epoch sample, which covers time-scales from 0.02-8.7 yr in the
quasar rest-frame. Our sample contains up to 13 epochs of data per quasar, with
an average of 7 epochs per quasar. We find that both the incidence and the
amplitude of variability are greater across longer time-scales. Part of our
monitoring programme specifically targeted half of these BAL quasars at
rest-frame time-scales <2 months. This revealed variability down to the
shortest time-scales we probe (8-10 days). Observed variations in only portions
of BAL troughs or in lines that are optically thick suggest that at least some
of these changes are caused by clouds (or some type of outflow substructures)
moving across our lines of sight. In this crossing cloud scenario, the
variability times constrain both the crossing speeds and the absorber
locations. Typical variability times of order ~1 year indicate crossing speeds
of a few thousand km/s and radial distances near ~1 pc from the central black
hole. However, the most rapid BAL changes occurring in 8-10 days require
crossing speeds of 17 000 - 84 000 km/s and radial distances of only 0.001-0.02

speeds, and the inferred locations are within the nominal radius of the broad

hadronic taus, since isolation and the transverse momenta are in tension. This
efficiency could be improved by including boosted di-tau jets as an object in

transfer code that generates synthetic spectra, or images. It can be used as a
diagnostic tool for comparison with astrophysical observations or laboratory
astrophysics experiments. We have developed a 3D short-characteristic solver
that works with a 3D nonuniform Cartesian grid. We have implemented a piecewise
cubic, locally monotonic, interpolation technique that dramatically reduces the
numerical diffusion effect. The code takes into account the velocity gradient
effect resulting in gradual Doppler shifts of photon frequencies and subsequent
alterations of spectral line profiles. It can also handle periodic boundary
conditions. This first version of the code assumes Local Thermodynamic
Equilibrium (LTE) and no scattering. The opacities and source functions are
specified by the user. In the near future, the capabilities of IRIS will be
extended to allow for non-LTE and scattering modeling. IRIS has been validated
through a number of tests. We provide the results for the most relevant ones,
in particular a searchlight beam test, a comparison with a 1D plane-parallel
model, and a test of the velocity gradient effect. IRIS is a generic code to
address a wide variety of astrophysical issues applied to different objects or
structures, such as accretion shocks, jets in young stellar objects, stellar
atmospheres, exoplanet atmospheres, accretion disks, rotating stellar winds,
cosmological structures. It can also be applied to model laboratory
astrophysics experiments, such as radiative shocks produced with high power
lasers.

due to accretion. In this study we relax, for the first time, the assumption
that accretion can be either chaotic, i.e. when the accretion episodes are
randomly and isotropically oriented, or coherent, i.e. when they occur all in a
preferred plane. Instead, we consider different degrees of anisotropy in the
fueling, never confining to accretion events on a fixed direction. We follow
the black hole growth evolving contemporarily mass, spin modulus a and spin
direction. We discover the occurrence of two regimes. An early phase (M <~ 10
million solar masses) in which rapid alignment of the black hole spin direction
to the disk angular momentum in each single episode leads to erratic changes in
the black hole spin orientation and at the same time to large spins (a ~ 0.8).
A second phase starts when the black hole mass increases above >~ 10 million
solar masses and the accretion disks carry less mass and angular momentum
relatively to the hole. In the absence of a preferential direction the black
holes tend to spin-down in this phase. However, when a modest degree of
anisotropy in the fueling process (still far from being coherent) is present,
the black hole spin can increase up to a ~ 1 for very massive black holes (M >~
100 million solar masses), and its direction is stable over the many accretion
cycles. We discuss the implications that our results have in the realm of the
observations of black hole spin and jet orientations.

discovery prospects for neutralino dark matter, taken here to be a general
admixture of bino, wino, and Higgsino. Experimental constraints can be weakened
or even nullified in regions of parameter space near 1) purity limits, where
the dark matter is mostly bino, wino, or Higgsino, or 2) blind spots, where the
relevant couplings of dark matter to the $Z$ or Higgs bosons vanish
identically. We analytically identify all blind spots relevant to
spin-independent and spin-dependent scattering and show that they arise for
diverse choices of relative signs among $M_1$, $M_2$, and $\mu$. At present,
XENON100 and IceCube still permit large swaths of viable parameter space,
including the well-tempered neutralino. On the other hand, upcoming experiments
should have sufficient reach to discover dark matter in much of the remaining
parameter space. Our results are broadly applicable, and account for a variety
of thermal and non-thermal cosmological histories, including scenarios in which
neutralinos are just a component of the observed dark matter today. Because
this analysis is indifferent to the fine-tuning of electroweak symmetry
breaking, our findings also hold for many models of neutralino dark matter in
the MSSM, NMSSM, and Split Supersymmetry. We have identified parameter regions
at low $\tan \beta$ which sit in a double blind spot for both spin-independent
and spin-dependent scattering. Interestingly, these low $\tan \beta$ regions
are independently favored in the NMSSM and models of Split Supersymmetry which
accommodate a Higgs mass near 125 GeV.

Their detailed structure depends on the properties of the intra-cluster medium
(ICM): hydrodynamical simulations predict the CFs to be distorted by
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHIs), but aligned magnetic fields, viscosity,
or thermal conduction can suppress the KHIs. Thus, observing the detailed
structure of sloshing CFs can be used to constrain these ICM properties. Both
smooth and distorted sloshing CFs have been observed, indicating that the KHI
is suppressed in some clusters, but not in all. Consequently, we need to
address at least some sloshing clusters individually before drawing general
conclusions about the ICM properties. We present the first detailed attempt to
constrain the ICM properties in a specific cluster from the structure of its
sloshing CF. Proximity and brightness make the Virgo cluster an ideal target.
We combine observations and Virgo-specific hydrodynamical sloshing simulations.
Here we focus on a Spitzer-like temperature dependent viscosity as a mechanism
to suppress the KHI, but discuss the alternative mechanisms in detail. We
identify the CF at 90 kpc north and north-east of the Virgo center as the best
location in the cluster to observe a possible KHI suppression. For viscosities
$\gtrsim$ 10% of the Spitzer value KHIs at this CF are suppressed. We describe
in detail the observable signatures at low and high viscosities, i.e. in the
presence or absence of KHIs. We find indications for a low ICM viscosity in
archival XMM-Newton data and demonstrate the detectability of the predicted
features in deep Chandra observations.

Assessing how strong such environmental interactions may have been is therefore
an important element in understanding the baryonic evolution of dSphs and their
derived dark matter distribution.
  Here we present results from a wide-area CTIO/MOSAIC II photometric survey of
the Carina dSph, reaching down to about two magnitudes below the oldest main
sequence turn-off (MSTO). This data-set enables us to trace the structure of
Carina in detail out to very large distances from its center, and as a function
of stellar age.
  We observe the presence of an extended structure made up primarily of ancient
MSTO stars, at distances between 25arcmin-60arcmin from Carina's center,
confirming results in the literature that Carina extends well beyond its
nominal tidal radius.
  The large number statistics of our survey reveals features such as isophote
twists and tails that had gone undetected in other previous shallower surveys.
This is the first time that such unambiguous signs of tidal disruption have
been found in a Milky Way ""classical"" dwarf other than Sagittarius.
  We also demonstrate the presence of a negative age gradient in Carina
directly from its MSTOs, and trace it out to very large distances from the
galaxy center. The signs of interaction with the Milky Way make it unclear
whether the age gradient was already in place before Carina underwent tidal
disruption.

to compute derivatives. The essence of Forward AD is to attach perturbations to
each number, and propagate these through the computation. When derivatives are
nested, the distinct derivative calculations, and their associated
perturbations, must be distinguished. This is typically accomplished by
creating a unique tag for each derivative calculation, tagging the
perturbations, and overloading the arithmetic operators. We exhibit a subtle
bug, present in fielded implementations, in which perturbations are confused
despite the tagging machinery. The essence of the bug is this: each invocation
of a derivative creates a unique tag but a unique tag is needed for each
derivative calculation. When taking derivatives of higher-order functions,
these need not correspond! The derivative of a higher-order function $f$ that
returns a function $g$ will be a function $f'$ that returns a function
$\bar{g}$ that performs a derivative calculation. A single invocation of $f'$
will create a single fresh tag but that same tag will be used for each
derivative calculation resulting from an invocation of $\bar{g}$. This
situation arises when taking derivatives of curried functions. Two potential
solutions are presented, and their serious deficiencies discussed. One requires
eta expansion to delay the creation of fresh tags from the invocation of $f'$
to the invocation of $\bar{g}$, which can be difficult or even impossible in
some circumstances. The other requires $f'$ to wrap $\bar{g}$ with tag
renaming, which is difficult to implement without violating the desirable
complexity properties of forward AD.

the magnetic field of TrES-3b can be constrained if its near-UV light curve

should range between 8 G and 30 G. Using these magnetic field values and an
assumed B_star of 100 G, the Vidotto et al. method predicts a timing difference
of 5-11 min. We did not detect an early ingress in our three nights of near-UV

precision of 3.7 mmag. However, we determined an upper limit of TrES-3b's
magnetic field strength to range between 0.013 and 1.3 G (for a 1-100 G
magnetic field strength range for the host star, TrES-3) using a timing
difference of 138 s derived from the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. To
verify our results of an abnormally small magnetic field strength for TrES-3b

stars (spectral types A-K) but rarely around low mass M-type stars. We have
spatially resolved a debris disk around the remarkable M3-type star GJ581
hosting multiple planets using deep PACS images at 70, 100 and 160 microns as
part of the DEBRIS Program on the Herschel Space Observatory. This is the
second spatially resolved debris disk found around an M-type star, after the
one surrounding the young star AU Mic (12 Myr). However, GJ 581 is much older
(2-8 Gyr), and is X-ray quiet in the ROSAT data. We fit an axisymmetric model
of the disk to the three PACS images and found that the best fit model is for a
disk extending radially from 25+/-12 AU to more than 60 AU. Such a cold disk is
reminiscent of the Kuiper Belt but it surrounds a low mass star (0.3 M_sol) and
its fractional dust luminosity L_dust/L_* of \sim 10^-4 is much higher. The
inclination limits of the disk found in our analysis make the masses of the
planets small enough to ensure the long-term stability of the system according
to some dynamical simulations. The disk is collisionally dominated down to
submicron-sized grains and the dust cannot be expelled from the system by
radiation or wind pressures because of the low luminosity and low X-ray
luminosity of GJ581. We suggest that the correlation between low-mass planets
and debris disks recently found for G-type stars also applies to M-type
stars.Finally, the known planets, of low masses and orbiting within 0.3 AU from
the star, cannot dynamically perturb the disk over the age of the star,
suggesting that an additional planet exists at larger distance that is stirring
the disk to replenish the dust.

here that it varies only little among a very wide range of mass distributions,

microwave-based time-frequency transfer [8-10] is inadequate for

femtosecond-level timing jitter and accuracies below 1E-17; as such,
commensurate optically-based transfer methods are needed. While fiber-based

to the closeness of available atomic energies to anticipated neutrino masses,
over nuclear target experiments. Disadvantage of using atomic targets, the
smallness of rates, is overcome by the macro-coherent amplification mechanism.
The atomic or molecular process we use is a cooperative deexcitation of a
collective body of atoms in a metastable level |e> emitting a neutrino pair and
a photon; |e> -> |g> + gamma + nu_i nu_j where nu_i's are neutrino mass

choice of heavy target atom or molecule such as Xe or I_2 that has a large M1 x

representation of quantum spin chains with an improvement on the conventional

  The rest of this thesis is divided into two parts. The first part is devoted
to eigenvalues of quantum many-body systems (QMBS). I introduce Isotropic
Entanglement, which draws from various tools in random matrix theory and free
probability theory (FPT) to accurately approximate the eigenvalue distribution
of QMBS on a line with generic interactions. Next, I discuss the energy
distribution of one particle hopping random Schr\""odinger operator in 1D from
FPT in context of the Anderson model.
  The second part is devoted to ground states and gap of QMBS. I first give the
necessary background on frustration free (FF) Hamiltonians, real and imaginary
time evolution within MPS representation and a numerical implementation. I then
prove the degeneracy and FF condition for quantum spin chains with generic
local interactions, including corrections to our earlier assertions. I then
summarize my efforts in proving lower bounds for the entanglement of the ground
states, which includes some new results, with the hope that they inspire future
work resulting in solving the conjecture given therein. Next I discuss two
interesting measure zero examples where FF Hamiltonians are carefully
constructed to give unique ground states with high entanglement. One of the
examples (i.e., $d=4$) has not appeared elsewhere. In particular, we calculate
the Schmidt numbers exactly, entanglement entropies and introduce a novel
technique for calculating the gap which may be of independent interest. The
last chapter elaborates on one of the measure zero examples (i.e., $d=3$) which
is the first example of a FF translation-invariant spin-1 chain that has a
unique highly entangled ground state and exhibits signatures of a critical
behavior.

climatic perturbations that occur over long periods of time have a significant
impact on species interactions patterns. However, observations of how these
patterns change over time are typically limited to extant communities, which is
particularly problematic for communities with long-lived species. Here we
integrate stable isotope analysis and network theory to reconstruct patterns of
trophic interactions for six independent mammalian communities that inhabited
mammoth steppe environments spanning western Europe to eastern Alaska during
the Pleistocene. We use a Bayesian mixing model to quantify the proportional
contribution of prey to the diets of local predators, and assess how the
structure of trophic interactions changed across space and the Last Glacial
Maximum (LGM), a global climatic event that severely impacted mammoth steppe
communities. We find that large felids had diets that were more constrained
than other co-occurring predators, and largely influenced by an increase in
{\it Rangifer} abundance after the LGM. Moreover, the structural organization
of Beringian and European communities strongly differed: compared to Europe,
species interactions in Beringian communities before the LGM were highly
compartmentalized, or modular. This modularity was lost during the LGM, and
partially recovered after the glacial retreat, and we suggest that changes in
modularity among predators and prey may have been driven by geographic
insularity.

elevated sap pressures derive from compressed gas that is trapped within
certain wood cells and subsequently released when frozen sap thaws in the

eds. M. Terazawa et al., Hokkaido Univ. Press, 1995] who argued that gas
bubbles are prevented from dissolving because of osmotic pressure that derives
from differences in sap sugar concentrations and the selective permeability of
cell walls. We derive a system of differential-algebraic equations based on
conservation principles that is used to test the validity of the
Milburn-O'Malley hypothesis and also to determine the extent to which osmosis
is required. This work represents the first attempt to derive a detailed

measurements in the context of observing modes in which the science camera
takes millisecond exposures. In this formulation, the wavefront sensor
measurements provide a means to jointly estimate the static speckle and the
planetary signal. The ability to estimate planetary intensities in as little as
few seconds has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency of exoplanet
search surveys. Unlike currently used methods, in which increasing the
observation time beyond a certain threshold is useless, this method produces
estimates whose error covariances decrease more quickly than inversely
proportional to the observation time. This is due to the fact that the
estimates of the quasi-static aberrations are informed by a new random (but
approximately known) wavefront every millisecond. The method can be extended to
include angular (due to diurnal field rotation) and spectral diversity.
Numerical experiments are performed with wavefront data from the AEOS Adaptive
Optics System sensing at 850 nm. These experiments assume a science camera
wavelength $\lambda$\ of $1.1 \, \mu$, that the measured wavefronts are exact,
and a Gaussian approximation of shot-noise. The effects of detector read-out
noise and other issues are left to future investigations. A number of static
aberrations are introduced, including one with a spatial frequency exactly
corresponding the planet location, which was at a distance of $\approx
3\lambda/D$\ from the star. Using only 4 seconds of simulated observation time,
a planetary intensity, of $\approx 1$ photon/ms, a stellar intensity of
$\approx 10^5$\ photons/ms (contrast ratio $10^5$), the short-exposure
estimation method recovers the amplitudes static aberrations with a 1%
accuracy, and the planet brightness with a with 20% accuracy.

To detect such degenerate groundstates, we introduce a quantum fidelity as an

quantum phase transitions, without knowing any detailed broken symmetry,
between a broken symmetry phase and symmetry phases as well as between a broken
symmetry phase and other broken symmetry phases, when a system parameter
crosses its critical value (i.e., multiple bifurcation point). Each order
parameter, characterizing a broken symmetry phase, from each of degenerate
groundstates is shown similar multiple bifurcation behavior. Furthermore, to
complete the description of an ordered phase, it is possible to specify how
each order parameter from each of degenerate groundstates transforms under a
symmetry group that is possessed by the Hamiltonian because each order
parameter is invariant under only a subgroup of the symmetry group although the
Hamiltonian remains invariant under the full symmetry group. Examples are given

employing the tensor network algorithms based on infinite-size lattices. For

be beamformed to produce station beams which form the inputs for the central
correlator. Two-stage beamforming within stations can reduce SKA-low signal
processing load and costs, but has not been previously explored for the
irregular station layouts now favoured in radio astronomy arrays. This paper
illustrates the effects of two-stage beamforming on sidelobes and effective
area, for two representative station layouts (regular and irregular gridded
tile on an irregular station). The performance is compared with a single-stage,
irregular station. The inner sidelobe levels do not change significantly
between layouts, but the more distant sidelobes are affected by the tile
layouts; regular tile creates diffuse, but regular, grating lobes. With very
sparse arrays, the station effective area is similar between layouts. At lower
frequencies, the regular tile significantly reduces effective area, hence
sensitivity. The effective area is highest for a two-stage irregular station,
but it requires a larger station extent than the other two layouts. Although
there are cost benefits for stations with two-stage beamforming, we conclude
that more accurate station modelling, and SKA-low configuration specifications,
are required before design finalisation.

susceptibility measurements show the presence of magnetic correlations even
when the spontaneous magnetization is zero which indicates the presence of
preformed short range magnetic-clusters. The characteristics of these short
range magnetic-clusters that exist above Curie temperature are quite distinct
than that of Griffiths phase e.g the inverse dc susceptibility exhibits an
field independent upward deviation, and the second harmonic of ac
susceptibility is non-negative. Below Curie temperature the system exhibit
spin-glass like features such as irreversibility in the field cooled and zero
field cooled magnetization and frequency dependence in the peak of ac
susceptibility. The presence of a spin or cluster -glass like state is ruled
out by the absence of field divergence in third harmonic of ac susceptibility
and zero field cooled memory. This indicates that the observed spin-glass like
features are possibility due to progressive thermal blocking of
ferromagnetic-clusters which is further confirmed by the Wohlfarth's model of
superparamagnetism. The frequency dependence of the peak of ac susceptibility
obeys the Vogel-Fulcher law with $\tau_0\approx 10^{-9}$ s. This together with
the existence of an AT line in H-T space indicates the existence of significant

So far there are no established backtesting procedures for EL, quantifying its
impact with regards to pricing or risk adjusted profitability measures. In this
paper, a practically oriented, top-down approach to assess the quality of EL by
backtesting with a properly defined risk measure is introduced. In a first
step, the concept of risk expenses (Cost of Risk) has to be extended beyond the
classical provisioning view, towards a more adequate capital consumption
approach (Impact of Risk, IoR). On this basis, the difference between
parameter-based EL and actually reported Impact of Risk is decomposed into its
key components. The proposed method will deepen the understanding of practical
properties of EL, reconciles the EL with a clearly defined and observable risk
measure and provides a link between upcoming IFRS 9 accounting standards for
loan loss provisioning with IRBA regulatory capital requirements. The method is
robust irrespective whether parameters are simple, expert based values or
highly predictive and perfectly calibrated IRBA compliant methods, as long as
parameters and default identification procedures are stable.

from a multiplicative group of rank $r$ not too large. Specifically, given

certain paths of length $k$ in the graph giving at most $n^{1+\varepsilon}$
unit distances from the group above. We require that the rank $r\le c\log n$

disks, regulating the mass accretion process, the transport of angular
momentum, and the growth of dust particles.
  We intend to determine the magnitude of the turbulent motions in the outer
parts (> 100 AU) of the disk surrounding DM Tau. Turbulent motions can be
constrained by measuring the nonthermal broadening of line emission from heavy
molecules. We used the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer to study emission
from the CS molecule in the disk of DM Tau. High spatial (1.4 x 1 "") and
spectral resolution (0.126 km/s) CS J=3-2 images provide constraints on the
molecule distribution and velocity structure of the disk. A low sensitivity CS
J=5-4 image was used in conjunction to evaluate the excitation conditions. We
analyzed the data in terms of two parametric disk models, and compared the
results with detailed time-dependent chemical simulations.
  The CS data confirm the relatively low temperature suggested by observations
of other simple molecules. The intrinsic linewidth derived from the CS J=3-2
data is much larger than expected from pure thermal broadening. The magnitude
of the derived nonthermal component depends only weakly on assumptions about
the location of the CS molecules with respect to the disk plane. Our results
indicate turbulence with a Mach number around 0.4 - 0.5 in the molecular layer.
Geometrical constraints suggest that this layer is located near one scale
height, in reasonable agreement with chemical model predictions.

responsible for the production of neutron-capture elements through the main
s-process (main slow neutron capture process). The major neutron source is
13C(alpha, n)16O, which burns radiatively during the interpulse periods at
about 8 keV and produces a rather low neutron density (10^7 n/cm^3). The second
neutron source 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg, partially activated during the convective
thermal pulses when the energy reaches about 23 keV, gives rise to a small
neutron exposure but a peaked neutron density (Nn(peak) > 10^11 n/cm^3). At
metallicities close to solar, it does not substantially change the final
s-process abundances, but mainly affects the isotopic ratios near s-path
branchings sensitive to the neutron density. We examine the effect of the
present uncertainties of the two neutron sources operating in AGB stars, as
well as the competition with the 22Ne(alpha, gamma)26Mg reaction. The analysis
is carried out on AGB the main-s process component (reproduced by an average
between M(AGB; ini) = 1.5 and 3 Msun at half solar metallicity, see Arlandini
et al. 1999), using a set of updated nucleosynthesis models. Major effects are
seen close to the branching points. In particular, 13C(alpha, n)16O mainly
affects 86Kr and 87Rb owing to the branching at 85Kr, while small variations
are shown for heavy isotopes by decreasing or increasing our adopted rate by a
factor of 2 - 3. By changing our 22Ne(alpha, n)25Mg rate within a factor of 2,
a plausible reproduction of solar s-only isotopes is still obtained. We provide
a general overview of the major consequences of these variations on the s-path.
A complete description of each branching will be presented in Bisterzo et al.,
in preparation.

with friction are obtained by solving the inelastic Enskog kinetic equation
from the Chapman-Enskog method. The heat and momentum fluxes as well as the
cooling rate are determined to first order in the deviations of the
hydrodynamic field gradients from their values in the homogeneous steady state.
Since the collisional cooling cannot be compensated locally for the heat
produced by the external driving force, the reference distribution $f^{(0)}$
(zeroth-order approximation) depends on time through its dependence on
temperature. This fact gives rise to conceptual and practical difficulties not
present in the undriven case. On the other hand, to simplify the analysis and
given that we are interested in computing transport in the first order of
deviations from the reference state, the steady-state conditions are considered
to get explicit forms for the transport coefficients and the cooling rate. A
comparison with recent molecular dynamics simulations for driven granular
fluids shows an excellent agreement for the kinematic viscosity although some
discrepancies are observed for the longitudinal viscosity and the thermal
diffusivity at large densities. Finally, a linear stability analysis of the
hydrodynamic equations with respect to the homogeneous steady state is
performed. As expected, no instabilities are found thanks to the presence of

exact computations and asymptotics of spin networks. The large-entries regimes
(semiclassical limits) occur in many areas of physics and chemistry, and in
particular in discretization algorithms of applied quantum mechanics. Here we
extend recent work on the basic building block of spin networks, namely the
Wigner 6j symbol or Racah coefficient, enlightening the insight gained by
exploiting its self-dual properties and studying it as a function of two
(discrete) variables. This arises from its original definition as an
(orthogonal) angular momentum recoupling matrix. Progress also derives from
recognizing its role in the foundation of the modern theory of classical
orthogonal polynomials, as extended to include discrete variables. Features of
the imaging of various regimes of these orthonormal matrices are made explicit
by computational advances -based on traditional and new recurrence relations-
which allow an interpretation of the observed behaviors in terms of an
underlying Hamiltonian formulation as well. This paper provides a contribution
to the understanding of the transition between two extreme modes of the 6j,
corresponding to the nearly classical and the fully quantum regimes, by
studying the boundary lines (caustics) in the plane of the two matrix labels.
This analysis marks the evolution of the turning points of relevance for the
semiclassical regimes and puts on stage an unexpected key role of the Regge
symmetries of the 6j.

use of triplet-triplet annihilation of excitations in molecular systems. In

upconversion. The main objective of this work is to design a proof of principle
model that can be used to shed light on the relevance of the interaction
between the different physical processes that take part in these kinds of

experimentalists toward the design of materials with maximum efficiency. Here
we show, in a 1D model system, that even in the presence of these processes
upconversion can be optimized by varying the ratio between the two molecular

higher H2O production rate than comet Hyakutake, to evaluate the photochemistry
associated with the production and loss of O(1S) and O(1D) atoms and emission
processes of green and red-doublet lines. We present the wavelength-dependent
photo-attenuation rates for different photodissociation processes forming O(1S)
and O(1D). The calculated radiative efficiency profiles of O(1S) and O(1D)
atoms show that in comet Hale-Bopp the green and red-doublet emissions are
emitted mostly above radial distances of 10^3 and 10^4 km, respectively. The
model calculated [OI] 6300 A emission surface brightness and average intensity
over the Fabry-P{\'e}rot spectrometer field of view are consistent with the
observation of Morgenthaler et al. (2001), while the intensity ratio of green
to red-doublet emission is in agreement with the observation of Zhang et al.
(2001). In comet Hale-Bopp, for cometocentric distances less than 10^5 km, the
intensity of [OI] 6300 A line is mainly governed by photodissociation of H2O.
Beyond 10^5 km, O(1D) production is dominated by photodissociation of the water
photochemical daughter product OH. Whereas the [OI] 5577 A emission line is
controlled by photodissociation of both H2O and CO2. The calculated mean excess
energy in various photodissociation processes show that the photodissociation
of CO2 can produce O(1S) atoms with higher excess velocity compared to the
photodissociation of H2O. Thus, our model calculations suggest that involvement
of multiple sources in the formation of O(1S) could be a reason for the larger
width of green line than that of red-doublet emission lines observed in several
comets.

of data as it was, and its provenance graph, at a certain point in time.
Supporting time-aware provenance querying is challenging and requires: (i)
explicitly representing the time information in the provenance graphs, and (ii)
providing abstractions and efficient mechanisms for time-aware querying of
provenance graphs over an ever growing volume of data. The existing provenance
models treat time as a second class citizen (i.e. as an optional annotation).
This makes time-aware querying of provenance data inefficient and sometimes
inaccessible. We introduce an extended provenance graph model to explicitly
represent time as an additional dimension of provenance data. We also provide a
query language, novel abstractions and efficient mechanisms to query and
analyze timed provenance graphs. The main contributions of the paper include:
(i) proposing a Temporal Provenance Model (TPM) as a timed provenance model;
and (ii) introducing two concepts of timed folder, as a container of related
set of objects and their provenance relationship over time, and timed paths, to
represent the evolution of objects tracing information over time, for analyzing
and querying TPM graphs. We have implemented the approach on top of FPSPARQL, a
query engine for large graphs, and have evaluated for querying TPM models. The
evaluation shows the viability and efficiency of our approach.

We briefly survey this {\em noncommutative peak interpolation}, which we have
studied with coauthors in a long series of papers, and whose basic theory now
appears to be approaching its culmination. This program developed from, and is
based partly on, theorems of Hay and Read whose proofs were spectacular, but

conversely give examples of the use of these theorems in peak interpolation.
For example, we prove a useful new noncommutative peak interpolation theorem.

accuracy from a statistical viewpoint, reflecting the fact that their
convergence rates are slower than nonparametric rates for the estimation of
high-dimensional functions. This difficulty has led to an emphasis on the
so-called functional linear model, which is much more flexible than common
linear models in finite dimension, but nevertheless imposes structural
constraints on the relationship between predictors and responses. Recent
advances have extended the linear approach by using it in conjunction with link
functions, and by considering multiple indices, but the flexibility of this
technique is still limited. For example, the link may be modeled parametrically
or on a grid only, or may be constrained by an assumption such as monotonicity;
multiple indices have been modeled by making finite-dimensional assumptions. In
this paper we introduce a new technique for estimating the link function
nonparametrically, and we suggest an approach to multi-index modeling using
adaptively defined linear projections of functional data. We show that our
methods enable prediction with polynomial convergence rates. The finite sample
performance of our methods is studied in simulations, and is illustrated by an
application to a functional regression problem.

proteins kinesin and dynein. Using quantitative data obtained from a fungal
model system, we previously developed ASEP-models of bidirectional motion of
motors along unipolar microtubules (MTs) near the cell ends of the elongated
hyphal cells (herein referred as ""unipolar section""). However, recent
quantitative live cell imaging in this system has demonstrated that long-range
motility of motors and their endosomal cargo mainly occurs along extended
antipolar microtubule bundles within the central part of the cell (herein
referred to as ""bipolar section""). Dynein and kinesin-3 motors coordinate their
activity to move early endosomes (EEs) in a bidirectional fashion, with dynein
mediating retrograde motility along the unipolar section near the cell poles,
whereas kinesin-3 is responsible for bidirectional motions along the antipolar
section. Here we extend our modelling approach to simulate bidirectional
motility along an antipolar microtubule bundle. In our model, cargos
(particles) change direction on each MT with a turning rate $\Omega$ and the
MTs are linked to each other at the minus ends where particles can hop between
MTs with a rate $q_1$ (obstacle-induced switching rate) or $q_2$ (end-induced
switching rate). By numerical simulations and mean-field approximations, we
investigate the distribution of particles along the MTs for different overall
densities $\Theta$. We find that even if $\Theta$ is low, the system can
exhibit shocks in the density profiles near plus and minus ends caused by
queueing of particles. We also discuss how the switching rates $q_{1,2}$
influence the type of motor that dominates the active transport in the bundle.

bias depends on the scales used to estimate the shape, which may be used to
optimise methods to reduce the bias. Here we develop a general approach to
quantify the bias. Although applicable to any weak lensing survey, we focus on
the implications for the ESA Euclid mission.
  Based on our study of synthetic galaxies we find that the bias is a few times
10^-3 for a typical galaxy observed by Euclid. Consequently, it cannot be
neglected and needs to be accounted for. We demonstrate how one can do so using
spatially resolved observations of galaxies in two filters. We show that HST
observations in the F606W and F814W filters allow us to model and reduce the
bias by an order of magnitude, sufficient to meet Euclid's scientific
requirements. The precision of the correction is ultimately determined by the
number of galaxies for which spatially-resolved observations in at least two

decay of the curvaton, so that it would not have time to build up the curvature
perturbation. However, we show that this is not the case, and that the resonant
decay of the curvaton may be delayed even down to electroweak symmetry
breaking. This delay is due to the coupling of the higgs to the thermal

considering the curvaton evolution and the structure of the higgs resonances.
We then provide analytical expressions for the delay time, and for the
subsequent resonant production of the higgs, which ultimately leads to the
curvaton effective decay width. Contrary to expectations, it is possible to
obtain the observed curvature perturbation for values of the curvaton-higgs

to be tight for cliques $K_{\Delta+1}$ when $\Delta$ is even. However, for
$\Delta=3$ it was improved to $26/31|E|$ by Albertson and Haas [Parsimonious
edge colorings, Disc. Math. 148, 1996] and later to $6/7|E|$ by Rizzi
[Approximating the maximum 3-edge-colorable subgraph problem, Disc. Math. 309,
2009]. It is tight for $B_3$, the graph isomorphic to a $K_4$ with one edge
subdivided.
  We improve previously known bounds for $\Delta\in{3,...,7}$, under the
assumption that for $\Delta=3,4,6$ graph $G$ is not isomorphic to $B_3$, $K_5$
and $K_7$, respectively. For $\Delta \geq 4$ these are the first results which
improve over the Vizing's bound. We also show a new bound for subcubic
multigraphs not isomorphic to $K_3$ with one edge doubled.
  In the second part, we give approximation algorithms for the Maximum
k-Edge-Colorable Subgraph problem, where given a graph G (without any bound on
its maximum degree or other restrictions) one has to find a k-edge-colorable
subgraph with maximum number of edges. In particular, when G is simple for
k=3,4,5,6,7 we obtain approximation ratios of 13/15, 9/11, 19/22, 23/27 and
22/25, respectively. We also present a 7/9-approximation for k=3 when G is a
multigraph. The approximation algorithms follow from a new general framework
that can be used for any value of k.

However, it may easily dominate the computational cost when applied to large

based on computational strategies, and (ii) based on the properties and on the
topology of the chemical network. The first methods are more robust, while the
second are meant to be giving important information on the structure of large,
complex networks. To this aim we first discuss the numerical solvers for
integrating the system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) associated with
the chemical network. We then propose a buffer method that decreases the
computational time spent in solving the ODE system. We further discuss a
flux-based method that allows one to determine and then cut on the fly the less
active reactions. In addition we also present a topological approach for
selecting the most probable species that will be active during the chemical
evolution, thus gaining information on the chemical network that otherwise
would be difficult to retrieve. This topological technique can also be used as
an a priori reduction method for any size network. We implemented these methods
into a 1D Lagrangian hydrodynamical code to test their effects: both classes
lead to large computational speed-ups, ranging from x2 to x5. We have also
tested some hybrid approaches finding that coupling the flux method with a
buffer strategy gives the best trade-off between robustness and speed-up of
calculations.

Linearly-Transformed Particle-In-Cell (LTPIC) method, that employs linear
deformations of the particles to reduce the noise traditionally associated with
particle schemes. Formally, transforming the particles is justified by local
first order expansions of the characteristic flow in phase space. In practice
the method amounts to using deformation matrices within the particle shape
functions; these matrices are updated via local evaluations of the forward
numerical flow. Because it is necessary to periodically remap the particles on
a regular grid to avoid excessively deforming their shapes, the method can be
seen as a development of Denavit's Forward Semi-Lagrangian (FSL) scheme [J.
Denavit, J. Comp. Physics 9, 75 (1972)]. However, it has recently been
established [M. Campos Pinto, ""Smooth particle methods without smoothing"",
arXiv:1112.1859 (2012)] that the underlying Linearly-Transformed Particle
scheme converges for abstract transport problems, with no need to remap the
particles; deforming the particles can thus be seen as a way to significantly
lower the remapping frequency needed in the FSL schemes, and hence the
associated numerical diffusion. To couple the method with electrostatic field
solvers, two specific charge deposition schemes are examined, and their
performance compared with that of the standard deposition method. Finally,
numerical 1d1v simulations involving benchmark test cases and halo formation in
an initially mismatched thermal sheet beam demonstrate some advantages of our
LTPIC scheme over the classical PIC and FSL methods. Benchmarked test cases
also indicate that, for numerical choices involving similar computational
effort, the LTPIC method is capable of accuracy comparable to or exceeding that
of state-of-the-art, high-resolution Vlasov schemes.

and the nonequilibrium Green-function approach, we present a microscopic
kinetic theory to study the influence of the electron scattering on the
dynamics of the surface plasmon polariton in semiconductor nanowires. The
damping of the surface plasmon polariton originates from the resonant
absorption by the electrons (Landau damping), and the corresponding damping
exhibits size-dependent oscillations and distinct temperature dependence
without any scattering. The scattering influences the damping by introducing a
broadening and a shifting to the resonance. To demonstrate this, we investigate
the damping of the surface plasmon polariton in InAs nanowires in the presence
of the electron-impurity, electron-phonon and electron-electron Coulomb
scatterings. The main effect of the electron-impurity and electron-phonon
scatterings is to introduce a broadening, whereas the electron-electron Coulomb
scattering can not only cause a broadening, but also introduce a shifting to
the resonance. For InAs nanowires under investigation, the broadening due to
the electron-phonon scattering dominates. As a result, the scattering has a
pronounced influence on the damping of the surface plasmon polariton: The
size-dependent oscillations are smeared out and the temperature dependence is
also suppressed in the presence of the scattering. These results demonstrate
the the important role of the scattering on the surface plasmon polariton
damping in semiconductor nanowires.

matrix from a set of incomplete and noisy linear measurements. We introduce a
new model that can efficiently restrict the degrees of freedom of the problem
and is generic enough to find a lot of applications, for instance in
multichannel signal compressed sensing (e.g. sensor networks, hyperspectral

data matrices have a simultaneous low-rank and joint sparse structure, and we
propose a novel approach for efficient compressed sensing (CS) of such data.
Our CS recovery approach is based on a convex minimization problem that
incorporates this restrictive structure by jointly regularizing the solutions
with their nuclear (trace) norm and l2/l1 mixed norm. Our theoretical analysis
uses a new notion of restricted isometry property (RIP) and shows that, for
sampling schemes satisfying RIP, our approach can stably recover all low-rank

satisfying a particular concentration bound (e.g. the subgaussian ensembles) we
derive a lower bound on the number of CS measurements indicating the

This class of renewable energy systems aims to convert the aerodynamic forces
generated by tethered wings, flying in closed paths transverse to the wind
flow, into electricity. The accurate reconstruction of the wing's position,
velocity and heading is of fundamental importance for the automatic control of
these kinds of systems. The difficulty of the estimation problem arises from
the nonlinear dynamics, wide speed range, large accelerations and fast changes
of direction that the wing experiences during operation. It is shown that the
overall nonlinear system has a specific structure allowing its partitioning
into sub-systems, hence leading to a series of simpler filtering problems.
Different sensor setups are then considered, and the related sensor fusion
algorithms are presented. The results of experimental tests carried out with a
small-scale prototype and wings of different sizes are discussed. The designed
filtering algorithms rely purely on kinematic laws, hence they are independent
from features like wing area, aerodynamic efficiency, mass, etc. Therefore, the
presented results are representative also of systems with larger size and
different wing design, different number of tethers and/or rigid wings.

radiative pumping and location in the high radiation density environment of the
nuclear regions. Abundance ratios OH+/H2O+ of 1-2.5 are estimated in the nuclei

dominated by H+ - O+ - OH+ - H2O+ - H3O+, and we also argue that the H+
production is most likely dominated by X-ray/cosmic ray ionization. The full
set of observations and models leads us to propose that the molecular ions
arise in a relatively low density (\gtrsim10^4 cm-3) interclump medium, in
which case the ionization rate per H nucleus (including secondary ionizations)
is zeta>10^{-13} s-1, a lower limit that is severalx10^2 times the highest rate
estimates for Galactic regions. In Arp 220, our lower limit for zeta is
compatible with estimates for the cosmic ray energy density inferred previously
from the supernova rate and synchrotron radio emission, and also with the
expected ionization rate produced by X-rays. In NGC 4418, we argue that X-ray
ionization due to an AGN is responsible for the molecular ion production.

closer to the MIMO capacity, e.g., capacity-gap about 3.5 dB (the best known

novel soft output detection that can provide an excellent coded performance in

performance is analysed by using the Monte Carlo density evolution. It is found
that the NBLDPC codes can operate within 1.6 dB from the MIMO capacity.
Furthermore, the merit of using the NBLDPC codes in large MIMO systems with the
presence of imperfect channel estimation and spatial fading correlation which
are both the realistic scenarios for large MIMO systems is also pointed out.

invariant $e_{\mathbb{K}} (X)$ (\cite{Too}). In $1980$'s F\'elix et al.
introduced the concept of {\it depth} in algebraic topology and proved the
depth theorem: $depth (H_*(\Omega X, \mathbb{K})) \leq cat(X)$.
  In this paper, we use the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence of $X$ to
introduce a new numerical invariant, denoted by $\textsc{r}(X, \mathbb{K})$,
and show that it has the same properties as those of $e_{\mathbb{K}} (X)$.
  When the evaluation map (\cite{FHT88}) is non-trivial and
$char(\mathbb{K})\not = 2$, we prove that $\textsc{r}(X, \mathbb{K})$
interpolates $depth(H_*(\Omega X, \mathbb{K}))$ and $e_{\mathbb{K}} (X)$.
Hence, we obtain an improvement of L. Bisiaux theorem (\cite{Bis99}) and then
of the depth theorem.
  Motivated by these results, we associate to any commutative differential
graded algebra $(A,d)$, a purely algebraic invariant $\textsc{r}(A,d)$ and, via
the theory of minimal models, we relate it with our previous topological
results.
  In particular, if $(\Lambda V,d)$ is a Sullivan minimal algebra such that
$d=\sum_{i\geq k}d_i$ and $d_i(V)\subseteq \Lambda ^iV$, a greater lower bound

The particular emphasis is the flows whose angular velocity decreases but
specific angular momentum increases with increasing radial coordinate. Such
flows are Rayleigh stable, but must be turbulent in order to explain observed
data. Such a mismatch between the linear theory and observations/experiments is
more severe when any hydromagnetic/magnetohydrodynamic instability and then the
corresponding turbulence therein is ruled out. The present work explores the
effect of stochastic noise on such hydrodynamic flows. We essentially
concentrate on a small section of such a flow which is nothing but a plane
shear flow supplemented by the Coriolis effect. This also mimics a small
section of an astrophysical accretion disk. It is found that such
stochastically driven flows exhibit large temporal and spatial correlations of
perturbation velocities, and hence large energy dissipations of perturbation,
which presumably generate instability. A range of angular velocity (\Omega)
profiles of background flow, starting from that of constant specific angular
momentum (\lambda = \Omega r^2 ; r being the radial coordinate) to that of
constant circular velocity (v_\phi = \Omega r), is explored. However, all the
background angular velocities exhibit identical growth and roughness exponents
of perturbations, revealing a unique universality class for the stochastically
forced hydrodynamics of rotating shear flows. This work, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first attempt to understand origin of instability and
turbulence in the three-dimensional Rayleigh stable rotating shear flows by
introducing additive noise to the underlying linearized governing equations.
This has important implications to resolve the turbulence problem in
astrophysical hydrodynamic flows such as accretion disks.

of the SPARQL supporting folder and path nodes. We have implemented a query
engine that supports FPSPARQL and the evaluation results shows its viability
and efficiency for querying large graph datasets.

waveguides is proposed and theoretically investigated. A nematic liquid crystal
layer placed between a vertical configuration consisting of two gold stripes is
shown to allow for the extensive electro-optic tuning of the coupler's
waveguiding characteristics. Rigorous liquid-crystal switching studies are
coupled with the investigation of the optical properties of the proposed
plasmonic structure, taking into account different excitation conditions and
the impact of LC-scattering losses. A directional coupler optical switch is
demonstrated, which combines low power consumption, low cross-talk, short
coupling lengths, along with sufficiently reduced insertion losses.

from the basis of Frobenius-Euler. Recently, Simsek et als(see [13]) have given
some identities of q-analogue of Frobenius-Euler polynomials related to
q-Bernstein polynomials. From the methods of our paper, we can also derive the
results and identities of Simsek et als (cf.[13]).
