  Bayesian signal detection methods","11 Pages, submitted to Astronomy and Astrophysics",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The four-planet system around GJ 581 has received attention because it has
been claimed that there are possibly two additional low-mass companions as well
- one of them being a planet in the middle of the stellar habitable zone. We
re-analyse the available HARPS and HIRES Doppler data in an attempt to
determine the false positive rate of our Bayesian data analysis techniques and
to count the number of Keplerian signals in the GJ 581 data. We apply the
common Lomb-Scargle periodograms and posterior sampling techniques in the
Bayesian framework to estimate the number of signals in the radial velocities.
We also analyse the HARPS velocities sequentially after each full observing
period to compare the sensitivities and false positive rates of the two signal
detection techniques. By relaxing the assumption that the radial velocity noise
is white, we also demonstrate the consequences that noise correlations have on
the obtained results and the significances of the signals. According to our
analyses, the number of Keplerian signals favoured by the publicly available
HARPS and HIRES radial velocity data of GJ 581 is four. This result relies on
the sensitivity of the Bayesian statistical analysis techniques but also
depends on the assumed noise model. We also show that the radial velocity noise
is actually not white and that this feature has to be accounted for when
analysing radial velocities in a search for low-amplitude signals corresponding
to low-mass planets. ...

three-dimensional (3D) structure hence leaves an echo of correlations in the
evolutionary record. Reverse engineering 3D structures from such correlations
is an open problem in structural biology, pursued with increasing vigor as more
and more protein sequences continue to fill the data banks. Within this task
lies a statistical inference problem, rooted in the following: correlation
between two sites in a protein sequence can arise from firsthand interaction
but can also be network-propagated via intermediate sites; observed correlation
is not enough to guarantee proximity. To separate direct from indirect
interactions is an instance of the general problem of inverse statistical
mechanics, where the task is to learn model parameters (fields, couplings) from
observables (magnetizations, correlations, samples) in large systems. In the
context of protein sequences, the approach has been referred to as
direct-coupling analysis. Here we show that the pseudolikelihood method,
applied to 21-state Potts models describing the statistical properties of
families of evolutionarily related proteins, significantly outperforms existing
approaches to the direct-coupling analysis, the latter being based on standard
mean-field techniques. This improved performance also relies on a modified
score for the coupling strength. The results are verified using known crystal
structures of specific sequence instances of various protein families. Code

found that annealing in N2 also leads to superconductivity enhancement, similar
to the annealing effects of O2, I2 and air. However, vacuum annealing does not
enhance superconductivity, which indicates that the enhanced superconductivity
in O2-, N2-, I2- and air-annealed samples is not due to improved homogeneity.
In addition, we have treated the underdoped samples with nitric acid, which is
found to enhance superconductivity as well. Our analyses of these results
support the argument that the superconductivity enhancement, caused either by
annealing or nitric acid treatment, originates from the variation of
interstitial Fe. The interstitial Fe, which is destructive to superconducting
pairing, can be reduced by annealing in oxidation agents or nitric acid
treatment. We also find that although N2-, O2- and air-annealed samples exhibit
strong superconducting diamagnetism with -4pichi ~1 (chi, dc magnetic
susceptibility) for some samples, their actual superconducting volume fraction
probed by specific heat is low, ranging from 10% to 30% for 0.09 < x < 0.3,
indicating that the superconductivity suppression remains significant even in
annealed samples. The strong diamagnetism is associated with the
superconducting shielding effect on the non-superconducting phase. We have also
established the phase diagram of the annealed samples and compared it with that

strength of the rainbow feature for exoplanets that have liquid and icy water

cloud coverage of Earth. We calculate flux and polarization signals of
starlight that is reflected by horizontally and vertically inhomogeneous
Earth--like exoplanets, covered by patchy clouds consisting of liquid water
droplets or water ice crystals. The planetary surfaces are black. On a planet
with a significant coverage of liquid water clouds only, the total flux signal
shows a weak rainbow feature. Any coverage of the liquid water clouds by ice
clouds, however, dampens the rainbow feature in the total flux, and thus the
discovery of liquid water in the atmosphere. On the other hand, detecting the
primary rainbow in the polarization signal of exoplanets appears to be a
powerful tool for detecting liquid water in exoplanetary atmospheres, even when
these clouds are partially covered by ice clouds. In particular, liquid water
clouds covering as little as 10%-20% of the planetary surface, with more than
half of these covered by ice clouds, still create a polarized rainbow feature

enveloped by a droplet under shear flow. The smoothed profile method is used to
accurately account for the hydrodynamic interactions between particles due to

which droplets breakup depends on a velocity ratio, $E$, defined as the ratio
of the boundary shift velocity (that restores the droplet shape to a sphere) to
the diffusive flux velocity in units of the particle radius $a$. For $E < 10$,
$Ca_{B}$ is independent of $E$, as is consistent with the regime studied by
Taylor. When $E > 10$, $Ca_{B}$ behaves as $Ca_{\rm B} = 2E^{-1}$, which
confirms Karam and Bellinger's hypothesis. As a consequence, droplet break up
will occur when the time scale of droplet deformation $\dot{\gamma}^{-1}$ is
smaller than the diffusive time scale $t_{D} \equiv a^{2}/L\tau$ in units of
$a$, where $L$ is the diffusion constant and $\tau$ is the 2nd order
coefficient of the Ginzburg-Landau type free energy of the binary mixture. We
emphasize that the breakup of droplet dispersed particles is not only governed
by a balance of forces. We find that velocity competition is one of the
important contributing factor.

  details, more figures, and corollaries to make the application of the
  Myhill-Nerode theorem for hypergraphs easier in an algorithmic setting.
  Moreover, it provides a fix to the proof of the Myhill-Nerode theorem for
  graphs in the books of Downey and Fellows","Algorithmica 73(4):696-729, 2015","10.1007/s00453-015-9977-x",,"cs.DM cs.DS cs.FL math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We give an analog of the Myhill-Nerode methods from formal language theory
for hypergraphs and use it to derive the following results for two NP-hard
hypergraph problems:
  * We provide an algorithm for testing whether a hypergraph has cutwidth at
most k that runs in linear time for constant k. In terms of parameterized
complexity theory, the problem is fixed-parameter linear parameterized by k.
  * We show that it is not expressible in monadic second-order logic whether a
hypergraph has bounded (fractional, generalized) hypertree width. The proof
leads us to conjecture that, in terms of parameterized complexity theory, these
problems are W[1]-hard parameterized by the incidence treewidth (the treewidth
of the incidence graph).
  Thus, in the form of the Myhill-Nerode theorem for hypergraphs, we obtain a
method to derive linear-time algorithms and to obtain indicators for
intractability for hypergraph problems parameterized by incidence treewidth.
  In an appendix, we point out an error and a fix to the proof of the
Myhill-Nerode theorem for graphs in Downey and Fellow's book on parameterized
complexity.

Computer Physics Communications (in press)",,"10.1016/j.cpc.2013.06.012",,"physics.flu-dyn physics.space-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new method for the localization of the regions where small scale turbulent
fluctuations are present in hypersonic flows is applied to the large-eddy
simulation (LES) of a compressible turbulent jet with an initial Mach number
equal to 5. The localization method used is called selective LES and is based
on the exploitation of a scalar probe function $f$ which represents the
magnitude of the stretching-tilting term of the vorticity equation normalized
with the enstrophy (Tordella et al. 2007). For a fully developed turbulent
field of fluctuations, statistical analysis shows that the probability that $f$
is larger than 2 is almost zero, and, for any given threshold, it is larger if
the flow is under-resolved. By computing the spatial field of $f$ in each
instantaneous realization of the simulation it is possible to locate the
regions where the magnitude of the normalized vortical stretching-tilting is
anomalously high. The sub-grid model is then introduced into the governing
equations in such regions only. The results of the selective LES simulation are
compared with those of a standard LES, where the sub-grid terms are used in the
whole domain, and with those of a standard Euler simulation with the same
resolution. The comparison is carried out by assuming as reference field a
higher resolution Euler simulation of the same jet. It is shown that the
selective LES modifies the dynamic properties of the flow to a lesser extent
with respect to the classical LES. In particular, the prediction of the
enstrophy, mean velocity and density distributions and of the energy and
density spectra are substantially improved.

optimal rates of convergence for estimating the principal subspace which are
sharp with respect to all the parameters, thus providing a complete
characterization of the difficulty of the estimation problem in term of the
convergence rate. The lower bound is obtained by calculating the local metric
entropy and an application of Fano's lemma. The rate optimal estimator is
constructed using aggregation, which, however, might not be computationally
feasible. We then introduce an adaptive procedure for estimating the principal
subspace which is fully data driven and can be computed efficiently. It is
shown that the estimator attains the optimal rates of convergence
simultaneously over a large collection of the parameter spaces. A key idea in
our construction is a reduction scheme which reduces the sparse PCA problem to
a high-dimensional multivariate regression problem. This method is potentially
also useful for other related problems.

  In one direction, we use this connection to derive results in graph theory.
Our main tool is a generalization of the Sauer-Shelah Lemma. Using this tool we
obtain a series of inequalities and equalities related to properties of
orientations of a graph. Some of these results appear to be new, for others we

the limit of large kernel lengthscales. We consider using these kernels as
covariance matrices of e.g.\ Gaussian processes (GPs). In this situation one
typically scales the prior globally to normalise the average of the prior

view. We suggest the random walk kernel should be normalised locally, so that
each vertex has the same prior variance, and analyse the consequences of this
by studying learning curves for Gaussian process regression. Numerical
calculations as well as novel theoretical predictions for the learning curves
using belief propagation make it clear that one obtains distinctly different
probabilistic models depending on the choice of normalisation. Our method for
predicting the learning curves using belief propagation is significantly more
accurate than previous approximations and should become exact in the limit of

young stellar objects (YSOs) in the immediate vicinity of two bright-rimmed
clouds, BRC 27 (part of CMa R1) and BRC 34 (part of the IC 1396 complex). These
regions both appear to be actively forming young stars, perhaps triggered by
the proximate OB stars. In BRC 27, we find clear infrared excesses around 22 of
the 26 YSOs or YSO candidates identified in the literature, and identify 16 new
YSO candidates that appear to have IR excesses. In BRC 34, the one
literature-identified YSO has an IR excess, and we suggest 13 new YSO
candidates in this region, including a new Class I object. Considering the
entire ensemble, both BRCs are likely of comparable ages, within the
uncertainties of small number statistics and without spectroscopy to confirm or
refute the YSO candidates. Similarly, no clear conclusions can yet be drawn
about any possible age gradients that may be present across the BRCs.

chromospheric and prominence plasmas. Neutral helium atoms enhance the damping
in certain temperature interval, where the ratio of neutral helium and neutral
hydrogen atoms is increased. Therefore, the height-dependence of ionization
degrees of hydrogen and helium may influence the damping rate of Alfven waves.
We aim to study the effect of neutral helium in the damping of Alfven waves in
stratified partially ionized plasma of the solar chromosphere. We consider a
magnetic flux tube, which is expanded up to 1000 km height and then becomes
vertical due to merging with neighboring tubes, and study the dynamics of
linear torsional Alfven waves in the presence of neutral hydrogen and neutral
helium atoms. We start with three-fluid description of plasma and consequently
derive single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations for torsional Alfven
waves. Thin flux tube approximation allows to obtain the dispersion relation of
the waves in the lower part of tubes, while the spatial dependence of
steady-state Alfven waves is governed by Bessel type equation in the upper part
of tubes. Consecutive derivation of single-fluid MHD equations results in a new
Cowling diffusion coefficient in the presence of neutral helium which is
different from previously used one. We found that shorter-period (< 5 s)
torsional Alfven waves damp quickly in the chromospheric network due to
ion-neutral collision. On the other hand, longer-period (> 5 s) waves do not
reach the transition region as they become evanescent at lower heights in the
network cores. Propagation of torsional Alfven waves through the chromosphere
into the solar corona should be considered with caution: low-frequency waves
are evanescent due to the stratification, while high-frequency waves are damped
due to ion neutral collisions.

V~17.7(0.1) from the March 2006 eruption. The light curve clearly shows a
sinusoid-like variability with a 0.07 mag amplitude and a 42.48 min
periodicity, which is half of the orbital period of the system. In Sept. 2010,
the system underwent yet another superoutburst and returned to its quiescent
level by the beginning of 2012. This light curve once again showed a
double-humps, but with a significantly smaller ~0.01mag amplitude. Other types
of variability like a ""mini-outburst"" or SDSS1238-like features were not

the presence of spiral waves. We constructed a geometric model of a bounce-back

reproduce the observed light curves. The Doppler tomograms and the
double-hump-shape light curves in quiescence can be explained by a model system

~12000K, a late-type brown dwarf, and an accretion disk with two outer annuli

floating structures is critical for the design of offshore and coastal
facilities. The joint effect of various ocean variables on extreme responses of
offshore structures is fundamental in determining the design loads. For
example, it is known that mean values of wave periods tend to increase with
increasing storm intensity, and a floating system responds in a complex way to
both variables.
  However, specification of joint extremes in design criteria has often been
somewhat \textit{ad hoc}, being based on fairly arbitrary combinations of
extremes of variables estimated independently. Such approaches are even
outlined in design guidelines. Mathematically more consistent estimates of the
joint occurrence of extreme environmental variables fall into two camps in the
offshore industry -- response-based and response-independent. Both are outlined
here, with emphasis on response-independent methods, particularly those based
on the conditional extremes model recently introduced by Heffernan and Tawn

major twists and non-radial motions are typically related to the larger-scale
ambient environment around eruptive events. Our analysis of prominence
eruptions observed by the STEREO, SDO and SOHO spacecraft shows that prominence
spines retain, during the initial phases, the thin ribbon-like topology they
had prior to the eruption. This topology allows bending, rolling, and twisting
during the early phase of the eruption, but not before. The combined ascent and
initial bending of the filament ribbon is non-radial in the same general
direction as for the enveloping CME. However, the non-radial motion of the
filament is greater than that of the CME. In considering the global magnetic
environment around CMEs, as approximated by the Potential Field Source Surface
(PFSS) model, we find that the non-radial propagation of both erupting
filaments and associated CMEs is correlated with the presence of nearby coronal
holes, which deflect the erupting plasma and embedded fields. In addition, CME
and filament motions respectively are guided towards weaker field regions,
namely null points existing at different heights in the overlying
configuration. Due to the presence of the coronal hole, the large-scale forces
acting on the CME may be asymmetric. We find that the CME propagates usually
non-radially in the direction of least resistance, which is always away from
the coronal hole. We demonstrate these results using both low and high latitude
examples.

collisionless dark matter because of its ability to preserve the large-scale
success of the cold dark matter model, while seemingly solving its challenges
on small scales. We present here the first study of the expected dark matter
detection signal taking into account different self-scattering models. We
demonstrate that models with constant and velocity dependent cross sections,
which are consistent with observational constraints, lead to distinct
signatures in the velocity distribution, because non-thermalised features found
in the cold dark matter distribution are thermalised through particle
scattering. Depending on the model, self-interaction can lead to a 10%
reduction of the recoil rates at high energies, corresponding to a minimum
speed that can cause recoil larger than 300 km/s, compared to the cold dark
matter case. At lower energies these differences are smaller than 5% for all
models. The amplitude of the annual modulation signal can increase by up to
25%, and the day of maximum amplitude can shift by about two weeks with respect
to the cold dark matter expectation. Furthermore, the exact day of phase
reversal of the modulation signal can also differ by about a week between the
different models. In general, models with velocity dependent cross sections
peaking at the typical velocities of dwarf galaxies lead only to minor changes
in the detection signals, whereas allowed constant cross section models lead to
significant changes. We conclude that different self-interacting dark matter
scenarios might be distinguished from each other through the details of direct
detection signals. Furthermore, detailed constraints on the intrinsic
properties of dark matter based on null detections, should take into account
the possibility of self-scattering and the resulting effects on the detector
signal.

astrophysics and provide a formidable challenge for theoretical investigation.
They mark the spectacular end of the lives of massive stars and, in an
explosive eruption, release as much energy as the sun produces during its whole
life. A better understanding of the astrophysical role of supernovae as birth
sites of neutron stars, black holes, and heavy chemical elements, and more
reliable predictions of the observable signals from stellar death events are
tightly linked to the solution of the long-standing puzzle how collapsing stars
achieve to explode. In this article our current knowledge of the processes that
contribute to the success of the explosion mechanism are concisely reviewed.
After a short overview of the sequence of stages of stellar core-collapse
events, the general properties of the progenitor-dependent neutrino emission
will be briefly described. Applying sophisticated neutrino transport in
axisymmetric (2D) simulations with general relativity as well as in simulations
with an approximate treatment of relativistic effects, we could find successful
neutrino-driven explosions for a growing set of progenitor stars. First results
of three-dimensional (3D) models have been obtained, and magnetohydrodynamic
simulations demonstrate that strong initial magnetic fields in the pre-collapse
core can foster the onset of neutrino-powered supernova explosions even in
nonrotating stars. These results are discussed in the context of the present
controversy about the value of 2D simulations for exploring the supernova
mechanism in realistic 3D environments, and they are interpreted against the
background of the current disagreement on the question whether the standing
accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection is the crucial
agency that supports the onset of the explosion.

Using galaxy and halo samples from the Millennium simulation, we calibrate an
analytic model of the galaxy kinematic profiles comprised of a virialized
component with an isotropic Gaussian velocity distribution and an infall
component described by a skewed 2D t-distribution with a characteristic infall
velocity v_r and separate radial and tangential dispersions. We show that
convolving the real-space cross-correlation function with this velocity
distribution accurately predicts the redshift-space \xi_{cg}, and we show that
measurements of \xi_{cg} can be inverted to recover the four distinct elements
of the GIK profiles. These in turn provide diagnostics of cluster mass
profiles, and we expect the characteristic infall velocity v_r(r) in particular
to be insensitive to galaxy formation physics that can affect velocity
dispersions within halos. As a proof of concept we measure \xi_{cg} for rich
galaxy groups in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and recover GIK profiles for
groups in two bins of central galaxy stellar mass. The higher mass bin has a
v_r(r) curve very similar to that of 10^{14} Msun halos in the Millennium

GIK modeling of cluster-galaxy cross-correlations can be a valuable complement
to stacked weak lensing analyses, allowing novel tests of modified gravity
theories that seek to explain cosmic acceleration.

predict that TDGs cannot contain significant amounts of non-baryonic dark
matter. In this paper, the first exhaustive sample of TDG-candidates from
observations and numerical calculations is gathered from the literature. These
stellar systems are gas-rich at the present, but they will probably evolve into
gas-poor objects that are indistinguishable from old dwarf elliptical galaxies
(dEs) based on their masses and radii. Indeed, known gas-poor TDGs appear as
normal dEs. According to the currently prevailing cosmological paradigm, there
should also be a population of primordial galaxies that formed within haloes of
dark matter in the same mass range. Due to their different composition and
origin, it would be expected that objects belonging to that population would
have a different structure than TDGs and would thus be distinguishable from
them, but such a population cannot be identified from their masses and radii.
Moreover, long-lived TDGs could indeed be numerous enough to account for all
dEs in the Universe. Downsizing, i.e. that less massive galaxies tend to be

clouds of the Solar Neighbourhood has been identified by Gutermuth et al. How
it relates to the properties of embedded clusters, in particular to the
recently established radius-density relation, has so far not been investigated.
In this paper, we model the development of the stellar component of molecular
clumps as a function of time and initial local volume density so as to provide
a coherent framework able to explain both the molecular-cloud and
embedded-cluster relations quoted above. To do so, we associate the observed
volume density gradient of molecular clumps to a density-dependent free-fall
time. The molecular clump star formation history is obtained by applying a
constant SFE per free-fall time, $\eff$.
  For volume density profiles typical of observed molecular clumps (i.e.
power-law slope $\simeq -1.7$), our model gives a star-gas surface-density
relation $\Sigma_{\star} \propto \Sigma_{gas}^2$, in very good agreement with
the Gutermuth et al relation. Taking the case of a molecular clump of mass $M_0
\simeq 10^4 Msun$ and radius $R \simeq 6 pc$ experiencing star formation during
2 Myr, we derive what SFE per free-fall time matches best the normalizations of
the observed and predicted ($\Sigma_{\star}$, $\Sigma_{gas}$) relations. We
find $\eff \simeq 0.1$. We show that the observed growth of embedded clusters,
embodied by their radius-density relation, corresponds to a surface density
threshold being applied to developing star-forming regions. The consequences of
our model in terms of cluster survivability after residual star-forming gas
expulsion are that due to the locally high SFE in the inner part of
star-forming regions, global SFE as low as 10% can lead to the formation of
bound gas-free star clusters.

velocity dispersion and the stellar population parameters age, metallicity and

Supernova Survey. In agreement with previous findings, we find that SALT2
stretch factor values show the strongest dependence on stellar population age.
Hence, SNe Ia peak-luminosity is closely related to the age of the stellar
progenitor systems, where more luminous SNe Ia appear in younger stellar
populations. We find no statistically significant trends in the Hubble residual
with any of the stellar population parameters studied, including age and
metallicity contrary to the literature, as well as with stellar velocity
dispersion. Moreover, we find that the method of stellar mass derivation is
affecting the Hubble residual-mass relationship when lower number statistics
are used. We extend the sample to also include SNe Ia with available SDSS host
galaxy photometry only. For this larger sample (247 objects) the reported
Hubble residual-mass relation is strongly dependent on the stellar mass range
studied and behaves as a step function. In the high mass regime, probed by our
host spectroscopy sample, the relation between Hubble residual and stellar mass
is flat. Below a stellar mass of ~2x10^10 Msun, i.e. close to the evolutionary
transition mass of low-redshift galaxies reported in the literature, the trend
changes dramatically such that lower mass galaxies possess lower luminosity SNe
Ia after light-curve corrections. This non-linear behaviour of the Hubble
residual-mass relationship should be accounted for when using stellar mass as a
further parameter for minimising the Hubble residuals.

resonance locks, previously considered in binaries with an early-type star,
occur universally in WD binaries. In a resonance lock, the orbital and spin
frequencies evolve in lockstep, so that the tidal forcing frequency is
approximately constant and a particular normal mode remains resonant, producing
efficient tidal dissipation and nearly synchronous rotation. We show that
analogous locks between the spin and orbital frequencies can occur not only
with global standing modes, but even when damping is so efficient that the
resonant tidal response becomes a traveling wave. We derive simple analytic
formulas for the tidal quality factor Q and tidal heating rate during a g-mode
resonance lock, and verify our results numerically. We find that Q ~ 10^7 for
orbital periods ~ 1 - 2 hr in C/O WDs, and Q ~ 10^9 for P_orb ~ 3 - 10 hr in
helium WDs. Typically tidal heating occurs sufficiently close to the surface
that the energy should be observable as surface emission. Moreover, near an
orbital period of ~ 10 min, the tidal heating rate reaches ~ 10^{-2} L_\sun,
rivaling the luminosities of our fiducial WD models. Recent observations of the
13-minute double-WD binary J0651 are roughly consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Tides naturally tend to generate differential rotation; however,
we show that the fossil magnetic field strength of a typical WD can maintain

existence of non-abelian gauge fields interacting with an axion. In its
simplest realization, an SU(2) gauge field is assumed to begin inflation in a
rotationally invariant VEV. The dynamics of the gauge fields significantly
modifies the equations of motion for the axion, providing an additional damping
term that supports slow-roll inflation, without the need to fine tune the axion
decay constant. We demonstrate that in an appropriate slow-roll limit it is
possible to integrate out the massive gauge field fluctuations whilst still
maintaining the nontrivial modifications of the gauge field to the axion. In
this slow-roll limit, chromo-natural inflation is exactly equivalent to a
single scalar field effective theory with a non-minimal kinetic term, i.e. a
P(X,\chi) model. This occurs through a precise analogue of the gelaton
mechanism, whereby heavy fields can have unsuppressed effects on the light
field dynamics without contradicting decoupling. The additional damping effect
of the gauge fields can be completely captured by the non-minimal kinetic term
of the single scalar field effective theory. We utilize the single scalar field
effective theory to infer the power spectrum and non-gaussianities in
chromo-natural inflation and confirm that the mass squared of all the gauge
field fluctuations is sufficiently large and positive that they completely
decouple during inflation. These results confirm that chromo-natural inflation
is a viable, stable and compelling model for the generation of inflationary
perturbations.

that aim at studying the chemo-dynamical history of the major Galactic
components (bulge, thin and thick disks, and halo) - either as a follow-up to
the Gaia mission or on their own merits. Based on a large grid of synthetic
spectra that cover the full range in stellar parameters of typical survey
targets, we devise an optimal wavelength range and argue for a moderately
high-resolution spectrograph. As a result, the kinematic precision is not
limited by any of these factors, but will practically only suffer from
systematic effects, easily reaching uncertainties <1 km/s. Under realistic
survey conditions (namely, considering stars brighter than r=16 mag with
reasonable exposure times) we prefer an ideal resolving power of R~20000 on
average, for an overall wavelength range (with a common two-arm spectrograph
design) of [395;456.5] nm and [587;673] nm. We show for the first time on a

t^-0.35 at its fastest point (where t is time) for our reference model, while
the dust mass and its proxy -- the infrared excess emission -- fades
significantly faster (~ t^-0.8). These later level off to a decay rate of

system with a boundary at finite charge density and temperature. In our naive
AdS/BCFT extension of a well known AdS/CFT system a non-zero charge density
must be supported by a magnetic field. As a result, the Hall conductivity is a
constant inversely proportional to the coefficients of pertinent topological
terms. Since the direct conductivity vanishes, such behaviors resemble that of
a quantum Hall system with Fermi energy in the gap between the Landau levels.
We further analyze the properties stemming from our holographic approach to a
quantum Hall system. We find that at low temperatures the thermal and electric
conductivities are related through the Wiedemann-Franz law, so that every
charge conductance mode carries precisely one quantum of the heat conductance.
From the computation of the edge currents we learn that the naive holographic
model is dual to a gapless system if tensionless RS branes are used in the
AdS/BCFT construction. To reconcile this result with the expected quantum Hall
behavior we conclude that gravity solutions with tensionless RS branes must be
unstable, calling for a search of more general solutions. We briefly discuss

doubling operator on (n)-solvability and using this, we show that
F_{n.5}^m/F_{n+1}^m is nontrivial for links (and string links) with
sufficiently many components. Moreover, we show that these quotients contain an
infinite cyclic subgroup. We also show that links and string links modulo
(1)-solvability is a nonabelian group. We show that we can relate other
filtrations with Milnor's invariants. We show that if a link is n-positive,

useful as a calibration source for detection of the EoR signature, as it should
have a smooth and predictable thermal spectrum across the frequency band of

32 tile prototype show that the Moon does exhibit a similar trend to that

particular, there is an abrupt increase in the observed flux density of the
Moon within the internationally recognised Frequency Modulated (FM) radio band.
The observations have implications for future low frequency surveys and EoR
detection experiments that will need to take this reflected emission from the

cluster metallicity bimodality in the hierarchical galaxy assembly scenario,
based on the observed galaxy mass-[O/H] relation and the galaxy stellar mass
function up to z ~4, and on theoretical merger rates. We derive a new galaxy
[Fe/H]-M(star) relation as a function of z, and by assuming that GCs share the
metallicity of their parent galaxy when they form, we populate the merger tree
with GCs. We perform a series of Monte-Carlo simulations of the galaxy
assembly, and study the properties of the final GC population as a function of
galaxy mass, assembly and star formation history, and under different
assumptions for the evolution of the galaxy mass-[Fe/H] relation. The main
results are: 1) The hierarchical clustering scenario naturally predicts a
metallicity bimodality in the galaxy GC population: the metal-rich GCs are
formed in the galaxy main progenitor around z~2, and the metal-poor GCs are
accreted from satellites and formed at z~3-4. 2) The model reproduces the
observed relations for the metallicity of the metal-rich and metal-poor GCs as
a function of galaxy mass. The positions of the metal-poor and metal-rich peaks
depend exclusively on the evolution of the galaxy mass-[Fe/H] relation and the
[O/Fe], both of which can be constrained by this method. We find that the
galaxy [O/Fe] evolves linearly with z from a value of ~0.5 at z~4 to a value of
~0.1 at z=0. 3) Given a galaxy mass, the relative strength of the metal-rich
and metal-poor peaks depends exclusively on the galaxy assembly and star
formation history: galaxies in denser environments and/or early types galaxies
show a larger fraction of metal-poor GCs, while galaxies with a sparse merger
history and/or late type galaxies are dominated by metal-rich GCs. 4) The GC
metallicity bimodality disappears for galaxy masses below M(star)~1e9, and for
z>2.

time-varying. An averaging method is proposed. Unlike the existing results in
the literatures which assume the LTI agents to be neutrally stable, we relax
this condition, only making assumption that the LTI agents are stablizable and
detectable. Observer-based leader-following consensus is also considered.

general regression setting where rank restrictions on a submatrix of the

lattice when the underlying dynamics is governed by energy-conserving
Hamiltonian equation of motion. We find that the apparent super-diffusive
growth of the length scale can be interpreted as the vortex mobility diverging
logarithmically in the size of the vortex-antivortex pair, where the time
dependence of the characteristic length scale can be fitted as $L(t) \sim
((t+t_{0}) \ln(t+t_{0}))^{1/2}$ with a finite offset time $t_0$. This
interpretation is based on a simple phenomenological model of vortex-antivortex
annihilation to explain the growth of the coarsening length scale $L(t)$. The
nonequilibrium spin autocorrelation function $A(t)$ and the growing length
scale $L(t)$ are related by $A(t) \simeq L^{-\lambda}(t)$ with a distinctive
exponent of $\lambda \simeq 2.21$ (for $E=0.4$) possibly reflecting the strong
effect of propagating spin wave modes. We also investigate the nonequilibrium
relaxation (NER) of the system under sudden heating of the system from a
perfectly ordered state to the regime of quasi-long-range order, which provides
a very accurate estimation of the equilibrium correlation exponent $\eta (E) $
for a given energy $E$. We find that both the equal-time spatial correlation
$C_{nr}(r,t)$ and the NER autocorrelation $A_{nr}(t)$ exhibit scaling features
consistent with the dynamic exponent of $z_{nr} = 1$.

obtain all Ricci-flat warped metrics with flat base in closed form and show
that the number of free parameters is one less than the dimension of the base.
Without any assumptions on the base and fibre geometry, we then show that a

Applying this result systematically all possible warped forms of the Euclidean,

both of the phases can be modeled virtually via an analytic free energy
function [M. Mehta and D. A. Kofke, Molecular Physics 79, 39 (1993)], the GEMC

a smooth variety, so that the Hilbert-Chow morphism \gamma: H -> W//G is a
resolution of singularities of the quotient W//G. However, if dim(V)=3, we show
that H is singular. When dim(V)<3, we describe H by equations and also as the
total space of a homogeneous vector bundle over the product of two
Grassmannians. Then we consider the symplectic setting by letting n1=n2 and
replacing W by the zero fiber of the moment map \mu: W -> End(V). We study the

Hp' is smooth if dim(V)<3. In this case, the Hilbert-Chow morphism is a
resolution of singularities (sometimes a symplectic one) of the quotient

interact mainly with generalists while generalists interact with both
generalists and specialists, are often observed in mutualistic and antagonistic
bi-partite ecological networks. These have been explained in terms of the
relative abundance of species, using a null model that assigns links in
proportion to abundance, but doubts have been raised as to whether this offers
a complete explanation. In particular, host-parasite networks offer a variety
of examples in which the reverse patterns are observed.
  We propose that the link between specificity and species-richness may also be
driven by the co-evolution of hosts and parasites, as hosts allocate resources
to optimize defence against parasites, and parasites to optimize attack on
hosts. In this hypothesis, species interactions are a result of resource
allocations. This novel concept, linking together many different arguments for
network structures, is introduced through the adaptive dynamics of a simple
ecological toy system of two hosts and two parasites.
  We analyse the toy model and its functionality, demonstrating that
co-evolution leads to specialization asymmetry in networks with closely related
parasites or fast host mutation rates, but not in networks with more distantly
related species. Having constructed the toy model and tested its applicability,
our model can now be expanded to the full problem of a larger system.

analyzed and their relations with uncertainty relations are discussed.
Super-resolutions obtained in the optical systems, including especially NSOM,
SIM and hyperlens, are related to an increase of the spatial frequencies in the
object plane leading to very small effective wavelengths and thus the
resolution is increased far beyond the Abbe limit. Super-resolution
measurements obtained in the fluorescent biological systems STED, FPALM and
RESOLFT are treated. An example of a four-level STED system is analyzed in
analogy to a four-level laser system, but the special space dependence of the
STED light is taken into account, restricting the fluorescence from extremely
small volume, and thus extremely high resolution is obtained. Localization of
individual molecules is described by the FPALM method where interference
between coherent fluorescent photons is taken into account. While in the STED
method very high laser intensities are needed in its variant method known as
RESOLFT the super-resolution measurements can be obtained by much weaker light
intensities. This new method is analyzed and the reasons for a such large
reduction in light intensities are explained.

  parameterized by treewidth deterministically in single exponential time","36 pages",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known that many local graph problems, like Vertex Cover and
Dominating Set, can be solved in 2^{O(tw)}|V|^{O(1)} time for graphs G=(V,E)
with a given tree decomposition of width tw. However, for nonlocal problems,
like the fundamental class of connectivity problems, for a long time we did not
know how to do this faster than tw^{O(tw)}|V|^{O(1)}. Recently, Cygan et al.
(FOCS 2011) presented Monte Carlo algorithms for a wide range of connectivity
problems running in time $c^{tw}|V|^{O(1)} for a small constant c, e.g., for
Hamiltonian Cycle and Steiner tree. Naturally, this raises the question whether
randomization is necessary to achieve this runtime; furthermore, it is
desirable to also solve counting and weighted versions (the latter without
incurring a pseudo-polynomial cost in terms of the weights).
  We present two new approaches rooted in linear algebra, based on matrix rank
and determinants, which provide deterministic c^{tw}|V|^{O(1)} time algorithms,
also for weighted and counting versions. For example, in this time we can solve
the traveling salesman problem or count the number of Hamiltonian cycles. The
rank-based ideas provide a rather general approach for speeding up even
straightforward dynamic programming formulations by identifying ""small"" sets of
representative partial solutions; we focus on the case of expressing
connectivity via sets of partitions, but the essential ideas should have
further applications. The determinant-based approach uses the matrix tree
theorem for deriving closed formulas for counting versions of connectivity
problems; we show how to evaluate those formulas via dynamic programming.

a Hamiltonian cycle and 0 otherwise. Motivated by the computational study of
the Hamiltonicity problem, we present three results on the structure of H_t: We
first show that H_t has rank at most 2^{t/2-1} over GF(2) via an appropriate
factorization that explicitly provides families of matchings X_t forming bases
for H_t. Second, we show how to quickly change representation between such
bases. Third, we notice that the sets of matchings X_t induce permutation
matrices within H_t.
  Subsequently, we use the factorization to obtain an 1.888^n n^{O(1)} time
Monte Carlo algorithm that solves the Hamiltonicity problem in directed
bipartite graphs. Our algorithm as well counts the number of Hamiltonian cycles
modulo two in directed bipartite or undirected graphs in the same time bound.

present a Monte Carlo algorithm that given an undirected graph on n vertices
along with a path decomposition of width at most pw decides Hamiltonicity in

were 95 +/- 6 ps and 143 +/- 10 ps for the samples with polycrystalline and

qualitatively explained by the local magnetic field induced by the larger
roughness of the interface of the polycrystalline sample. The sample with
epitaxial Fe/MgO tunnel contact showed higher magnitude of the spin
accumulation with a nearly symmetric behavior with respect to the bias polarity

expressing properties of probabilistic labeled transition systems (PLTS's). Two
equivalent semantics have been studied for this logic, both assigning to each
state a value in the interval [0,1] representing the probability that the
property expressed by the formula holds at the state. One semantics is
denotational and the other is a game semantics, specified in terms of
two-player stochastic parity games. A shortcoming of the probabilistic modal
{\mu}-calculus is the lack of expressiveness required to encode other important
temporal logics for PLTS's such as Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL).
To address this limitation we extend the logic with a new pair of operators:
independent product and coproduct. The resulting logic, called probabilistic
modal {\mu}-calculus with independent product, can encode many properties of
interest and subsumes the qualitative fragment of PCTL. The main contribution
of this paper is the definition of an appropriate game semantics for this
extended probabilistic {\mu}-calculus. This relies on the definition of a new
class of games which generalize standard two-player stochastic (parity) games
by allowing a play to be split into concurrent subplays, each continuing their
evolution independently. Our main technical result is the equivalence of the
two semantics. The proof is carried out in ZFC set theory extended with

functionals are conserved by the flow. We show that for $0<\mu<2$ the energy at

mass $m^*$ it attains its minimum value at a certain $\hat \Psi_m \in H^1(\GG)

the structure ${\mathcal M}={e^{i\theta}\hat \Psi_m, \theta\in \erre}$.

(such as OVI) show dimmer core relative to the edges. Previous models show that
the structure of the heavy ion streamer emission relates to the acceleration
regions of the slow solar wind at streamer legs and to gravitational settling
processes in the streamer core. Observations of Mg9+ ion EUV emission in
coronal streamers at solar minimum were first reported by the UVCS instrument.
The Mg X 625A emission is an order of magnitude smaller than the OVI 1032A
emission, requiring longer exposures to obtain statistically significant
results. Here, MgX coronal observations are analyzed and compared, for the
first time, with the solar minimum streamer structure in hydrogen and OVI
emissions. We employ the 2.5D three-fluid model, developed previously to study
the properties of O5+ ions in streamers, and calculate for the first time the
density, temperature, and outflow structure of Mg9+ ions in the solar minimum
streamer. The Mg9+ ions are heated by an empirical radial heating function
constrained by observations of the kinetic ion temperature obtained from MgX
emission line profiles. The detailed structure of Mg9+ density, temperature,
and outflow speed determined by the Coulomb momentum and energy exchange as
well as electromagnetic interactions with electrons and protons in the
three-fluid model of the streamer. The results of the model are in good
qualitative agreement with observations, and provide insights on the possible
link between the magnetic structure of the streamer, slow solar wind sources,
and relative abundances of heavy ions.

from which 35 were previously unknown. The new objects are all bright stars on
the Ecliptic Plane (magnitude range 4.7 < V < 11.7) and will therefore be of
great interest to studies of stellar structure and evolution. In particular,
several show multiple signals consistent with hybrid delta Scuti and gamma
Doradus pulsation, with different periodicities allowing very different regions
of the stellar interior to be studied. There are two subgroups of stars in our
sample: the cool metallic line Am (CP1) and the hot HgMn (CP3) stars. These
objects fall well inside the classical instability strip where delta Scuti,
gamma Doradus and slowly pulsating B-type stars are located. We also expect to
find periods correlated to the orbital period for CP1 objects as they are
mostly members of binary systems. For CP3 stars, rotationally-induced
variability is still a matter of debate. Although surface spots were detected,
they are believed to produce only marginal photometric amplitudes. So, periods
from several hours to a few days were expected for these two star groups. The
remaining 514 stars are likely to be constant in the investigated range from
0.1 to 10 days. In some cases, the presence of blending or systematic effects
prevented us from detecting any reliable variability and in those cases we
classified the star as constant. Finally, we have calibrated the variable stars
in terms of the effective temperature and luminosity in order to estimate
masses and ages. For this purpose we used specifically developed calibrations
for CP stars and, when available, HIPPARCOS parallaxes.

MT2, for general input momenta, non-numerical methods have been proposed for
some special clases of input momenta. One special case, considered in this
note, is the so-called `massless limit' in which all four daughter objects
(comprising one invisible particle and one visible system from each `side' of
the event) have zero mass. This note establishes that it is possible to
construct a stable and accurate implementation for evaluating MT2 based on an
analytic expression valid in that massless limit. Although this implementation
is found to have no significant speed improvements over existing evaluation
strategies, it leads to an unexpected by-product: namely a secondary variable,
that is found to be very similar to MT2 for much of its input-space and yet is
much faster to calculate. This is potentially of interest for hardware
applications that require very fast estimation of a mass scale (or QCD
background discriminant) based on a hypothesis of pair production -- as might
be required by a high luminosity trigger for a search for pair production of
new massive states undergoing few subsequent decays (eg di-squark or di-slepton
production). This is an application to which the contransverse mass MCT has
previously been well suited due to its simplicity and ease of evaluation.
Though the new variable requires a quadratic root to be found, it (like MCT)
does not require iteration to compute, and is found to perform better then MCT
in circumstances in which the information from the missing transverse momentum
(which the former retains and the latter discards) is both reliable and useful.

powerful mean of testing the modeling of transport processes in stars.
Rotational splittings are currently measured for a large number of red giant
stars and can provide stringent constraints on the rotation profiles. The aim
of this paper is to obtain a theoretical framework for understanding the
properties of the observed rotational splittings of red giant stars with slowly
rotating cores. This allows us to establish appropriate seismic diagnostics for
rotation of these evolved stars. Rotational splittings for stochastically
excited dipolar modes are computed adopting a first-order perturbative approach
for two $1.3 M_\odot$ benchmark models assuming slowly rotating cores. For red
giant stars with slowly rotating cores, we show that the variation of the
rotational splittings of $\ell=1$ modes with frequency depends only on the
large frequency separation, the g-mode period spacing, and the ratio of the
average envelope to core rotation rates (${\cal R}$). This leds us to propose a
way to infer directly ${\cal R}$ from the observations. This method is
validated using the Kepler red giant star KIC 5356201. Finally, we provide a
theoretical support for the use of a Lorentzian profile to measure the observed
splittings for red giant stars.

in N=1 superspace, which was analyzed previously by Kobakhidze {\it et al}. In
this stochastic supersymmetry(SUSY) framework, the soft SUSY breaking terms of
the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model(MSSM) such as the bilinear Higgs
mixing, trilinear coupling as well as the gaugino mass parameters are all
proportional to a single mass parameter \xi, a measure of supersymmetry
breaking arising out of stochasticity. While a nonvanishing trilinear coupling
at the high scale is a natural outcome of the framework, a favorable signature
for obtaining the lighter Higgs boson mass $m_h$ at 125 GeV, the model produces
tachyonic sleptons or staus turning to be too light. The previous analyses took
$\Lambda$, the scale at which input parameters are given, to be larger than the
gauge coupling unification scale $M_G$ in order to generate acceptable scalar
masses radiatively at the electroweak scale. Still this was inadequate for
obtaining $m_h$ at 125 GeV. We find that Higgs at 125 GeV is highly achievable
provided we are ready to accommodate a nonvanishing scalar mass soft SUSY
breaking term similar to what is done in minimal anomaly mediated SUSY breaking
(AMSB) in contrast to a pure AMSB setup. Thus, the model can easily accommodate
Higgs data, LHC limits of squark masses, WMAP data for dark matter relic
density, flavor physics constraints and XENON100 data. In contrast to the
previous analyses we consider $\Lambda=M_G$, thus avoiding any ambiguities of a
post-grand unified theory physics. The idea of stochastic superspace can easily
be generalized to various scenarios beyond the MSSM . PACS Nos: 12.60.Jv,

Riemann-Cartan geometry. We start from the assumption that the space-time can
be described as a non-Riemannian manifold, which, in addition to the metric
field, is endowed with torsion. In this new framework, the gravitational field
is represented not only by the metric, but also by the torsion, which is
completely determined by a geometric scalar field. We show that in this
formulation general relativity has a new kind of invariance, whose invariance
group consists of a set of conformal and gauge transformations, called Cartan
transformations. These involve both the metric tensor and the torsion vector
field, and are similar to the well known Weyl gauge transformations. By making
use of the concept of Cartan gauges, we show that, under Cartan
transformations, the new formalism leads to different pictures of the same
gravitational phenomena. We show that in an arbitrary Cartan gauge general
relativity has the form of a scalar-tensor theory. In this approach, the
Riemann-Cartan geometry appears as the natural geometrical setting of the
general relativity theory when the latter is viewed in an arbitrary Cartan
gauge. We illustrate this fact by looking at the one of the classical tests of
general relativity theory, namely the gravitational spectral shift. Finally, we
extend the concept of space-time symmetry to the more general case of
Riemann-Cartan space-times endowed with scalar torsion. As an example, we
obtain the conservation laws for auto-parallel motion in a static spherically
symmetric vacuum space-time in a Cartan gauge, whose orbits are identical to
Schwarzschild orbits in general relativity.

(\Box \Phi)^2 if we do not make the Fierz-Pauli tuning of the mass term. In de
Sitter the identification of the variable that describes the radiative degree

non-local in time. The use of this new variable provides a simple and

interactions due to the fluorine nucleus in CF+ on the rotational transitions.
Methods. We compute the fluorine spin rotation constant of CF+ using high-level
quantum chemical methods and determine the relative positions and intensities
of each hyperfine component. This information is used to fit the theoretical
hyperfine components to the observed CF+ line profiles, thereby employing the
hyperfine fitting method in GILDAS. Results. The fluorine spin rotation
constant of CF+ is 229.2 kHz. This way, the double-peaked CF+ line profiles are
well fitted by the hyperfine components predicted by the calculations. The
unusually large hyperfine splitting of the CF+ line therefore explains the
shape of the lines detected in the Horsehead nebula, without invoking intricate
kinematics in the UV-illuminated gas.

off a ^6LiD target has been investigated with the COMPASS spectrometer at CERN
for 0.003 (GeV/c)^2 < Q^2 < 10 (GeV/c)^2 and 3x10^-5< x_Bj < 0.1. The study is
based on 8100 events where a D^0 or anti D^0 is detected subsequently to a D*+
or D*- decay, and on 34000 events, where only a D^0 or anti D^0 is detected.
Kinematic distributions of D*, D and K*_2 are given as a function of their
energy E, transverse momentum p_T, energy fraction z, and of the virtual photon
variables nu, Q^2 and x_Bj. Semi-inclusive differential D* production
cross-sections are compared with theoretical predictions for D* production via
photon-gluon fusion into open charm. The total observed production
cross-section for D*+/- mesons with laboratory energies between 22 and 86 GeV
is 1.9 nb. Significant cross-section asymmetries are observed between D*+ and
D*- production for nu<40 GeV and z>0.6.

matrices. Each matrix in this product is of size N\times N with independent
standard complex Gaussian variables. The eigenvalues of such a product form a
determinantal point process on the complex plane (Akemann and Burda J. Phys A:
Math. Theor. 45 (2012) 465201), which can be understood as a generalization of
the finite Ginibre ensemble. As N\rightarrow\infty, a generalized infinite
Ginibre ensemble arises. We show that the set of absolute values of the points
of this determinantal process has the same distribution as
{R_1^{(n)},R_2^{(n)},...}, where R_k^{(n)} are independent, and (R_k^{(n)})^2
is distributed as the product of n independent Gamma variables Gamma(k,1). This
enables us to find the asymptotics for the hole probabilities, i.e. for the
probabilities of the events that there are no points of the process in a disc
of radius r with its center at 0, as r\rightarrow\infty. In addition, we solve
the relevant overcrowding problem: we derive an asymptotic formula for the
probability that there are more than m points of the process in a fixed disk of
radius r with its center at 0, as m\rightarrow\infty.

different accreting environment. When the accretion rate is moderate, the
accretion disk consists of an outer thin disk and an inner advection-dominated
accretion flow. In such a combined disk, the outer thin disk can sustain a
magnetic field with moderate strength at the event horizon, leading to the
formation of relativistic jets with moderate luminosity and speed via the
magnetohrodynamic Penrose process. When the accretion rate increases enough, on
the other hand, the disk becomes geometrically thin near the horizon. In this
slim disk, the denser plasmas can sustain a stronger magnetic field than that
in a combined disk, leading to the formation of jets with greater luminosity
and speed via the Blandford-Znajek processs. It is discussed that the former
jets are associated with the Fanaroff-Riley (FR) I galaxies and the latter with
FR II galaxies.

the quarkonia at the LHC, times the branching ratios of convenient decays, is
up to tens of nanobarn per unit rapidity in the case of charmonia and around
one nanobarn for the bottomonia. Measuring the quarkonia production as function
of rapidity will allow to determine the gluon distribution function in nucleons
in a very broad range of the Bjorken x from x~10^(-2) where it is already
known, down to x~10^(-6) where it is totally unknown. The scale of the gluon
distribution found from such measurements turns out to be rather low, Q^2 ~ 2.5

evaluate the scale by studying the next-to-leading-order production cross

current densities for a complex scalar field with nonzero chemical potential in
background of a flat spacetime with spatial topology $R^{p}\times (S^{1})^{q}$.
Along compact dimensions quasiperiodicity conditions with general phases are
imposed on the field. In addition, we assume the presence of a constant gauge
field which, due to the nontrivial topology of background space, leads to
Aharonov-Bohm-like effects on the expectation values. By using the
Abel-Plana-type summation formula and zeta function techniques, two different
representations are provided for both the current and charge densities. The
current density has nonzero components along the compact dimensions only and,
in the absence of a gauge field, it vanishes for special cases of twisted and
untwisted scalar fields. In the high-temperature limit, the current density and
the topological part in the charge density are linear functions of the
temperature. The Bose-Einstein condensation for a fixed value of the charge is
discussed. The expression for the chemical potential is given in terms of the
lengths of compact dimensions, temperature and gauge field. It is shown that
the parameters of the phase transition can be controlled by tuning the gauge
field. The separate contributions to the charge and current densities coming
from the Bose-Einstein condensate and from excited states are also
investigated.
