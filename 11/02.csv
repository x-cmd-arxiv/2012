between SICs and algebraic geometry by performing computer searches for linear
dependencies in higher dimensional SICs. We prove that linear dependencies will
always emerge in Weyl-Heisenberg orbits when the fiducial vector lies in a
certain subspace of an order 3 unitary matrix. This includes SICs when the

Fourier spectrum of the observed minus calculated (O-C) transit timing and
radial velocity diagrams (the highest peak having false-alarm probabilities of
56 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively) or long-term trends. Combining all
the available information, we conclude that the radial velocity and transit
timing techniques exclude, at 99 per cent confidence limit, any perturber more
massive than M \gtrsim 100 M_Earth with periods up to 10 times the period of
the inner planet. We also investigate the possible presence of an exomoon on
this system and determined that considering the scatter of the O-C transit
timing residuals a coplanar exomoon would likely produce detectable transits.
This hypothesis is however apparently ruled out by observations conducted by
other researchers. In case the orbit of the moon is not coplanar the accuracy
of our transit timing and transit duration measurements prevents any
significant statement. Interestingly, on the basis of our reanalysis of SOPHIE
data we noted that WASP-3 passed from a less active (log R'_hk=-4.95) to a more
active (log R'_hk=-4.8) state during the 3 yr monitoring period spanned by the

this analysis claims for a more intensive monitoring of the activity level of
this star in order to understand its impact on photometric and radial velocity

Then, I use this approach to create a systematic way to construct a rigid

be interpreted as a rigid cylinder which rotates while accelerating along the

increase entanglement. We analyse different strategies of local photon
subtraction from a two-mode squeezed state in terms of entanglement gain and
success probability. We develop a general framework that incorporates
imperfections and losses in all stages of the process: before, during, and
after subtraction. By combining all three effects into a single efficiency
parameter, we provide analytical and numerical results for subtraction
strategies using photon-number-resolving and threshold detectors. We compare
the entanglement gain afforded by symmetric and asymmetric subtraction
scenarios across the two modes. For a given amount of loss, we identify an
optimised set of parameters, such as initial squeezing and subtraction beam
splitter transmissivity, that maximise the entanglement gain rate. We identify
regimes for which asymmetric subtraction of different Fock states on the two
modes outperforms symmetric strategies. In the lossless limit, subtracting a
single photon from one mode always produces the highest entanglement gain rate.
In the lossy case, the optimal strategy depends strongly on the losses on each
mode individually, such that there is no general optimal strategy. Rather,
taking losses on each mode as the only input parameters, we can identify the
optimal subtraction strategy and required beam splitter transmissivities and
initial squeezing parameter. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
results for the distillation of continuous-variable quantum entanglement.

the $B\to K$ form factors. Furthermore, the isospin asymmetry in this decay is
expected to be very small. We investigate the deviation of the observables from

both a ""virtual theory"" and a ""chimera"", yet acknowledged that his argument
relies on the transfer principle. We analyze Connes' ""dart-throwing"" thought

are Lebesgue measurable, suggesting that Connes views a theory as being
""virtual"" if it is not definable in a suitable model of ZFC. If so, Connes'
claim that a theory of the hyperreals is ""virtual"" is refuted by the existence
of a definable model of the hyperreal field due to Kanovei and Shelah. Free
ultrafilters aren't definable, yet Connes exploited such ultrafilters both in
his own earlier work on the classification of factors in the 1970s and 80s, and

be vulnerable to Connes' criticism of virtuality. We analyze the philosophical

non-constructive foundational material, and specifically on the Dixmier trace

the area of computational neuroscience. Its most common usage is validation of
experimental methods as EEG and extracellular spike recordings or modeling of

Continuous experimental work has been re-raising the importance of polarization
effects between neuronal structures to neuronal communication. As this effects
relies on very small potential changes, better modeling methods are necessary
to quantify the weak electrical fields in the microscopic scale in a more
realistic way. An important factor of influence on local field effects in the
hippocampal formation is the heterogeneous resistivity of extracellular tissue.
The vast majority of modeling studies consider the extracellular space to be
homogeneous while experimentally, it has been shown that the stratum pyramidale
has two times higher resistivity then other hippocampal layers. Common
simulation methods for extracellular electrical fields based on the point
source approximation are bound to describe the resistance of the space with a
single, linear factor. We propose that models should be based on the space- and
time-dependent Maxwell equations in order to account for heterogeneous
properties of the extracellular space and specific arrangements of neurons in
dense hippocampal layers. To demonstrate the influence of heterogeneous
extracellular resistivity and neuronal spatial orientation on modeling results,
we combine solutions of classical compartment models with spatiotemporal PDEs
solved by the FEM. With the help of these methods, we show that the inclusion
of heterogeneous resistivity has a substantial impact on voltages in close
proximity to emitting neurons, increasing the extracellular potentials
substantially compared to the homogeneous variant.

$\mathrm{MP}_d$, we characterize the condition that $C$ contains infinitely
many PCF maps. In particular, we show that if $C$ is parameterized by
polynomials, then there are infinitely many PCF maps in $C$ if and only if
there is exactly one active critical point along $C$, up to symmetries; we
provide the critical orbit relation satisfied by any pair of active critical

polynomials, introduced by Milnor (1992), we show that
$\mathrm{Per}_1(\lambda)$ contains infinitely many PCF maps if and only if
$\lambda=0$. The proofs involve a combination of number-theoretic methods
(specifically, arithmetic equidistribution) and complex-analytic techniques
(specifically, univalent function theory). We provide a conjecture about
Zariski density of PCF maps in subvarieties of the space of rational maps, in

refractive-index perturbations moving at the speed of light. Here we found that
such perturbations scatter light in an unusual way: they amplify light by the
mixing of positive and negative frequencies, as we describe using a first Born
approximation and numerical simulations. The simplest scenario in which these
effects may be observed is within the initial stages of optical soliton
propagation: a steep shock front develops that may efficiently scatter a

second-order homogeneous linear recurrence with initial values 0 and 1. Among
such sequences s, we prove that the n-dimensional s-lecture hall cone is
Gorenstein for all n greater than or equal to 1 if and only if s is an

spherical hard solvophobic solutes is investigated in the Jagla liquid, a
simple liquid that consists of particles interacting via a spherically
symmetric potential combining a hard core repulsion and a longer ranged soft
core interaction, yet exhibits water-like anomalies. The results are compared
with equivalent calculations for a model of a typical atomic liquid, the
Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, and with predictions for hydrophobic solvation in
water using the cavity equation of state and the extended simple point charge
(SPC/E) model. We find that the Jagla liquid captures the qualitative
thermodynamic behavior of hydrophobic hydration as a function of temperature
for both small and large length scale solutes. In particular, for both the
Jagla liquid and water, we observe temperature-dependent enthalpy and entropy
of solvation for all solute sizes as well as a negative solvation entropy for
sufficiently small solutes at low temperature. The results suggest that,
compared to a simple liquid, it is the presence of a second thermally
accessible repulsive energy scale, acting to increasingly favor larger
separations for decreasing temperature, that is the essential characteristic of
a liquid that favors low-density, open structures and models hydrophobic
hydration, and that it is the presence of this second energy scale that leads
to the similarity in the behavior of water and the Jagla liquid. The
implications of the temperature and length scale dependence of solvation free
energies in water-like liquids are explored with a simple model for the
aggregation of solvophobic solutes. We show how aggregate stability depends
upon the size of the aggregate and the size of its constituent solutes, and we
relate this dependence to cold-induced destabilization phenomena such as the
cold-induced denaturation of proteins.

effects of binary interactions, metallicity, EPS models and IMF on several
widely used SFR calibrations based on the EPS models of Yunnan with and without
binary interactions, BC03, SB99, PEGASE and POPSTAR. The inclusion of binary
interactions makes these SFR conversion coefficients smaller (less than
0.2dex), and these differences increase with metallicity. The differences in
the calibration coefficient between SFR and the luminosity of $\rm H\alpha$
recombination line (C$_{\rm H\alpha}$) and that between SFR and the ultraviolet
(UV) fluxes at 1500 and 2800\,$\rm \AA$ (C$_{i, {\rm UV}}$), caused by IMF, are
independent of metallicity (0.03-0.33\,dex) except $\Delta$C$_{\rm H\alpha,

PEGASE models. Moreover, we find that $L_{\rm 2800}$ is not suitable to the
linear calibration of SFR at low metallicities.
  At last, we compare the effects of these several factors on the SFR
calibrations considered in this paper. The effects of metallicity/IMF and EPS
models on the C$_{\rm H\alpha}$ and C$_{\rm FIR}$ (the conversion coefficient

to 100 km/s. The derived proper motions show that out of these 8 outflows, 3
have tangential velocities less or equal to 20 km/s. This result shows that a
large fraction of the observed outflows have low intrinsic velocities, and that
the low proper motions are not merely a projection effect.

For this

period of time, associated with a given flux peak, during which the flux is
above half of the peak flux. I select a sample of 40 brightest gamma-ray flares
observed by Fermi/LAT during the first 4 years of its mission. The sample is
dominated by 4 blazars: 3C 454.3, PKS 1510-089, PKS 1222+216 and 3C 273. For
each flare, I calculate a light curve and variations of the photon index. For
the whole sample, I study the distributions of the peak flux, peak luminosity,
duration, time asymmetry, average photon index and photon index scatter. I find
that: 1) flares produced by 3C 454.3 are longer and have more complex light
curves than those produced by other blazars; 2) flares shorter than 1.5 days in
the source frame tend to be time-asymmetric with the flux peak preceding the
flare midpoint. These differences can be largely attributed to a smaller
viewing angle of 3C 454.3 as compared to other blazars. Intrinsically, the
gamma-ray emitting regions in blazar jets may be structured and consist of
several domains. I find no regularity in the spectral gamma-ray variations of
flaring blazars.

background-subtracted count rate was 9+/-2x10^{-3} counts s^{-1}, corresponding
to a detection significance level of 5-sigma. The X-ray spectrum was
characterized by a continuum extending up to about 7 keV, which can be modeled
by a power-law component with a photon index of 1.4--5.6, or by a thermal
bremsstrahlung component with a temperature of 0.7--13.3 keV, convolved with
interstellar absorption with an equivalent hydrogen column density of
0.3--2.4x10^{22} cm^{-2}. Assuming a distance of 3900 pc to the source, the
luminosity was 10^{32}--10^{34} ergs s^{-1} in the 0.3--10 keV energy band. The
origin of X-rays is considered to be either mass accretion on the white dwarf

been strongly-lensed into multiple images by a foreground galaxy at z = 0.960.
This system was serendipitously discovered as a set of extremely Ks-bright
high-redshift galaxies with red J - Ks colors using new data from the
UltraVISTA YJHKs near-infrared survey. The system was also previously
identified as an optically-faint lens/source system using the COSMOS ACS
imaging by Faure et al. (2008, 2011). Photometric redshifts for the three
brightest images of the source galaxy determined from twenty-seven band
photometry place the source at z = 2.4 +/- 0.1. We provide an updated lens
model for the system which is a good fit to the positions and morphologies of
the galaxies in the ACS image. The lens model implies that the magnification of
the three brightest images is a factor of 4 - 5. We use the lens model,
combined with the Ks-band image to constrain the size and Sersic profile of the
galaxy. The best-fit model is an ultra-compact galaxy (Re =
0.64^{+0.08}_{-0.18} kpc, lensing-corrected), with a Sersic profile that is
intermediate between a disk and bulge profile (n = 2.2^{+2.3}_{-0.9}). We
present aperture photometry for the source galaxy images which have been
corrected for flux contamination from the central lens. The best-fit stellar
population model is a massive galaxy (Log(M_{star}/M_{sol}) =
10.8^{+0.1}_{-0.1}, lensing-corrected) with an age of 1.0^{+1.0}_{-0.4} Gyr,
moderate dust extinction (Av = 0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.6}), and a low specific star
formation rate (Log(SSFR) < -11.0 yr^{-1}). This is typical of massive
""red-and-dead"" galaxies at this redshift and confirms that this source is the
first bona fide strongly-lensed massive ultra-compact quiescent galaxy to be
discovered. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects of finding a larger
sample of these galaxies.

paper shows how a two-parameter classification of massive-star magnetospheres
in terms of the magnetic wind confinement (which sets the Alfv\'en radius RA)
and stellar rotation (which sets the Kepler co-rotation radius RK) provides a
useful organisation of both observational signatures and theoretical
predictions. We compile the first comprehensive study of inferred and observed
values for relevant stellar and magnetic parameters of 64 confirmed magnetic OB
stars with Teff > 16 kK. Using these parameters, we locate the stars in the
magnetic confinement-rotation diagram, a log-log plot of RK vs. RA. This
diagram can be subdivided into regimes of centrifugal magnetospheres (CM), with
RA > RK, vs. dynamical magnetospheres (DM), with RK > RA. We show how key
observational diagnostics, like the presence and characteristics of Halpha
emission, depend on a star's position within the diagram, as well as other
parameters, especially the expected wind mass-loss rates. In particular, we
identify two distinct populations of magnetic stars with Halpha emission:
namely, slowly rotating O-type stars with narrow emission consistent with a DM,
and more rapidly rotating B-type stars with broader emission associated with a
CM. For O-type stars, the high mass-loss rates are sufficient to accumulate
enough material for line emission even within the relatively short free-fall
timescale associated with a DM: this high mass-loss rate also leads to a rapid
magnetic spindown of the stellar rotation. For the B-type stars, the longer
confinement of a CM is required to accumulate sufficient emitting material from
their relatively weak winds, which also lead to much longer spindown
timescales. [abbreviated]

effect can coalign the spins of a central supermassive black hole binary
accreting from a circumbinary (or circumnuclear) gas disc. We improve on
previous estimates by adding the dependence on system parameters, and noting
that the nonlinear nature of warp propagation in a thin viscous disc affects
alignment. This reduces the disc's ability to communicate the warp, and can
severely reduce the effectiveness of disc-assisted spin alignment. We test our
predictions with a Monte Carlo realization of random misalignments and
accretion rates and we find that the outcome depends strongly on the spin
magnitude. We estimate a generous upper limit to the probability of alignment
by making assumptions which favour it throughout. Even with these assumptions,
about 40% of black holes with $a \gtrsim 0.5$ do not have time to align with
the disc. If the residual misalignment is not small and it is maintained down
to the final coalescence phase this can give a powerful recoil velocity to the
merged hole. Highly spinning black holes are thus more likely of being subject
to strong recoils, the occurrence of which is currently debated.

superconductivity in Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 via proximity to Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta},
in order to access increasing temperature and energy scales for this
phenomenon. This was achieved by a new mechanical bonding technique we
developed, enabling the fabrication of high-quality junctions between
materials, unobtainable by conventional approaches. We observe
proximity-induced superconductivity in Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3 persisting up to at
least 80K, a temperature an order of magnitude higher than any previous
observations. Moreover, the induced superconducting gap in our devices reaches
values of 10mV, significantly enhancing the relevant energy scales. Our results
open new directions for fundamental studies in condensed matter physics and
enable a wide range of applications in spintronics and quantum computing.

The fast
flaring requires compact regions in the jet that boost their emission towards
the observer at an extreme Doppler factor of delta>50. For TeV photons to avoid
annihilation in the broad line region of PKS 1222+216, the flares must come
from large (pc) scales challenging most models proposed to explain them. Here
we elaborate on the magnetic reconnection minijet model for the blazar flaring,
focusing on the inherently time-dependent aspects of the process of magnetic
reconnection. I argue that, for the physical conditions prevailing in blazar
jets, the reconnection layer fragments leading to the formation a large number
of plasmoids. Occasionally a plasmoid grows to become a large, ""monster""
plasmoid. I show that radiation emitted from the reconnection event can account
for the observed ""envelope"" of ~ day-long blazar activity while radiation from
monster plasmoids can power the fastest TeV flares. The model is applied to
several blazars with observed fast flaring. The inferred distance of the
dissipation zone from the black hole and the typical size of the reconnection
regions are R_diss~0.3-1 pc and l' \simless 10^{16} cm, respectively. The
required magnetization of the jet at this distance is modest: sigma ~a few.
Such dissipation distance R_diss and reconnection size l' are expected if the
jet contains field structures with size of the order of the black-hole horizon.

that the deformed position and momentum operators admit a one-parameter family
of self-adjoint extensions. These operators engender new families of deformed
Hermite polynomials generalizing usual $q-$ Hermite polynomials. Relevant
matrix elements are computed. Finally, a $su(2)-$algebra representation of the

analytical framework for dark energy science that has been defined by its
members and the comprehensive three-year work plan they have developed for
implementing that framework. The analysis working groups cover five key probes
of dark energy: weak lensing, large scale structure, galaxy clusters, Type Ia
supernovae, and strong lensing. The computing working groups span cosmological
simulations, galaxy catalogs, photon simulations and a systematic software and
computational framework for LSST dark energy data analysis. The technical
working groups make the connection between dark energy science and the LSST
system. The working groups have close linkages, especially through the use of
the photon simulations to study the impact of instrument design and survey
strategy on analysis methodology and cosmological parameter estimation. The
white paper describes several high priority tasks identified by each of the 16
working groups. Over the next three years these tasks will help prepare for
LSST analysis, make synergistic connections with ongoing cosmological surveys
and provide the dark energy community with state of the art analysis tools.

  Version accepted in Eur. Phys. J. C",,"10.1140/epjc/s10052-013-2393-y",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  After the recent discovery of a Higgs-like boson particle at the CERN
LHC-collider, it becomes more necessary than ever to prepare ourselves for
identifying its standard or non-standard nature. The Electroweak parameter
Delta r relating the values of the gauge boson masses [MW,MZ] and the Fermi
constant [G_F] is the traditional observable encoding high precision
information of the electroweak physics at the quantum level. In this work we
present a complete quantitative study of Delta r in the framework of the
general (unconstrained) Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM). First of all we report
on a systematic analysis of Delta r at the full one loop level in the general
2HDM, which to our knowledge was missing in the literature. Thereby we extract
a theoretical prediction for the mass of the W-boson in this model, taking MZ,
\alpha_{em} and G_F as experimental inputs. We find typical corrections leading
to mass shifts $\delta MW \sim 20-40 MeV$ which help to improve the agreement
with the experimentally measured value, in a degree no less significant than in
the MSSM case. In the second part of our study we extend our calculation beyond
the mere one-loop order. We devise an effective Lagrangian approach that
captures the dominant higher order quantum effects on delta rho (viz. that part
of Delta r describing the breaking of the approximate SU(2) custodial symmetry)
in the limit of large Higgs boson self-interactions. This limit constitutes a
telltale property of the general 2HDM which is unmatched by e.g. the MSSM. Our
conclusion is that the Electroweak precision program to be conducted at the
LHC, and maybe at a future linear collider, can nicely complement the direct
searches. Should these distinctive loop effects be eventually found they would
signal a smoking gun hinting at non-standard Higgs physics.

interaction between two nodes as the strength of their relationship. We argue
that this interpretation may not be appropriate, since the interaction between
a pair of nodes could potentially be explained only by characteristics of the
nodes that compose the pair and, however, not by pair-specific features. In
interaction networks, where edges or arcs are count-valued, the above scenario
corresponds to a model of independence for the expected interaction in the
network, and consequently we propose the notions of arc strength, and edge
strength to be understood as departures from this model of independence. We
discuss how our notion of arc/edge strength can be used as a guidance to study
network structure, and in particular we develop a latent arc strength
stochastic blockmodel for directed interaction networks. We illustrate our
approach studying the interaction between the Kolkata users of the myGamma
mobile network.

This detection method is used for determining the presence or absence of

cyclic covariance matrix of received signals. In particular, the cyclic
correlation significance test is used to detect a specific signal-of-interest
by exploiting knowledge of its cyclic frequencies. Analytical expressions for
the probability of detection and probability of false-alarm under both
spatially uncorrelated or spatially correlated noise are derived and verified
by simulation. The detection performance in a Rayleigh flat-fading environment
is found and verified through simulations. One of the advantages of the
proposed method is that the detection threshold is shown to be independent of
both the number of samples and the noise covariance, effectively eliminating
the dependence on accurate noise estimation. The proposed method is also shown
to provide higher detection probability and better robustness to noise
uncertainty than existing multiple-antenna cyclostationary-based spectrum
sensing algorithms under both AWGN as well as a quasi-static Rayleigh fading
channel.

firmly detect an eclipse meaning that this system either contains a cool white

red-sensitive photometry or that it is non-eclipsing. Radial velocity
measurements for the main-sequence stars in three of our newly identified
eclipsing systems imply that their white dwarf masses are lower than those
inferred from modelling their SDSS spectra. 13 non-eclipsing post common

important source of traffic data. For sufficient coverage of the traffic
stream, it is important to maintain a reasonable penetration rate of probe
vehicles. From the standpoint of capturing higher-order traffic quantities such
as acceleration/deceleration, emission and fuel consumption rates, it is
desirable to examine the impact on the estimation accuracy of sampling
frequency on vehicle position. Of the two issues raised above, the latter is
rarely studied in the literature. This paper addresses the impact of both
sampling frequency and penetration rate on mobile sensing of highway traffic.
To capture inhomogeneous driving conditions and deviation of traffic from the
equilibrium state, we employ the second-order phase transition model (PTM).
Several data fusion schemes that incorporate vehicle trajectory data into the
PTM are proposed. And, a case study of the NGSIM dataset is presented which
shows the estimation results of various Eulerian and Lagrangian traffic
quantities. The findings show that while first-order traffic quantities can be
accurately estimated even with a low sampling frequency, higher-order traffic
quantities, such as acceleration, deviation, and emission rate, tend to be
misinterpreted due to insufficiently sampled vehicle locations. We also show
that a correction factor approach has the potential to reduce the sensing error
arising from low sampling frequency and penetration rate, making the estimation
of higher-order quantities more robust against insufficient data coverage of
the highway traffic.

primordial (H+He) cooling down to 10^4K, additional cooling via metal lines and
to lower temperatures, and molecular hydrogen (H_2) with shielding of atomic
and molecular hydrogen, in addition to metal line cooling. In order to analyze
the effect of these models, we follow the evolution of four field galaxies with
V_peak < 120 km/s to a redshift of zero using high-resolution Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamic simulations in a fully cosmological LCDM context. The spiral
galaxies produced in simulations with either primordial cooling or H_2 physics
have realistic, rising rotation curves. In contrast, the simulations with metal
line cooling and otherwise similar feedback and star formation produced
galaxies with the peaked rotation curves typical of most previous LCDM
simulations of spiral galaxies. The less-massive bulges and non-peaked rotation
curves in the galaxies simulated with primordial cooling or H_2 are linked to
changes in the angular momentum distribution of the baryons. These galaxies had
smaller amounts of low-angular momentum baryons because of increased gas loss
from stellar feedback. When there is only primordial cooling, the star forming
gas is hotter and the feedback-heated gas cools more slowly than when metal
line cooling is included and so requires less energy to be expelled. When H_2
is included, the accompanying shielding produces large amounts of clumpy, cold
gas where H_2 forms. Star formation in clumpy gas results in more concentrated
supernova feedback and greater efficiency of mass loss. The higher feedback
efficiency causes a decrease of low-angular momentum material. (abridged)

  International Symposium on Rarefied Gas Dynamics",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present new results building on the conservative deterministic spectral
method for the space homogeneous Boltzmann equation developed by Gamba and
Tharkabhushaman. This approach is a two-step process that acts on the weak form
of the Boltzmann equation, and uses the machinery of the Fourier transform to
reformulate the collisional integral into a weighted convolution in Fourier
space. A constrained optimization problem is solved to preserve the mass,
momentum, and energy of the resulting distribution.
  Within this framework we have extended the formulation to the case of more
general case of collision operators with anisotropic scattering mechanisms,
which requires a new formulation of the convolution weights. We also derive the
grazing collisions limit for the method, and show that it is consistent with
the Fokker-Planck-Landau equations as the grazing collisions parameter goes to
zero.

ab initio calculations of methane indicate that the C-H bonds are polarized

positively charged hydrogen atoms produce repulsive Coulomb potentials to a

pluripotency, but the fundamental mechanism remains largely unknown. This study
systematically analyzes multiple-omics data and builds a systems physical
network including genome-wide interactions between miRNAs and their targets to
reveal the systems mechanism of miRNA functions in mouse pluripotent stem
cells. Globally, miRNAs directly repress the pluripotent core factors during
differentiation state. Surprisingly, during pluripotent state, the top
important miRNAs do not directly regulate the pluripotent core factors as
thought, but they only directly target the pluripotent signal pathways and
directly repress developmental processes. Furthermore, at pluripotent state
miRNAs predominately repress DNA methyltransferases, the core enzymes for DNA
methylation. The decreasing methylation repressed by miRNAs in turn activates
the top miRNAs and pluripotent core factors, creating an active circuit system
to modulate pluripotency. MiRNAs vary their functions with different stem cell
states. While miRNAs directly repress pluripotent core factors to facilitate
the differentiation during cell differentiation, they also help stem cells to

scattering for superfluid helium confined within highly monodisperse, smooth,
and unidimensional silica pores. When the helium forms a thin film on the pore
walls, it supports a dramatically modified phonon-roton spectrum as well as a
2D surface roton. The energies of these modified phonon-roton modes are
consistent with predictions for a dilute, low-density film, while the energy of
the 2D surface roton corresponds to that of a dense film. The relatively smooth
and weak surface potential of the substrate permits the formation of a film
with large dilute regions and only small compressed regions. When the pores are
saturated with liquid, the modified phonon-roton spectrum disappears, and
bulk-like modes coexist with the 2D surface roton. Presumably, bulk-like liquid
occupies the core volume of the pores and high density liquid layers are
present at the liquid-solid interface. These findings clearly connect the
nature of the excitations to the local density of the liquid.

  Assuming that the data matrix X is of size Nxn, then with m linear

densities derived from the two ortho ground state transitions indicates that

when they later become at least partially thermalized with the cold gas

  the journal Advances in High Energy Physics (AHEP)",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The arbitrariness of Yukawa couplings can be reduced by the imposition of
some flavor symmetries and/or by the realization of texture zeros. We review
neutrino Yukawa textures with zeros within the framework of the type-I seesaw
with three heavy right chiral neutrinos and in the basis where the latter and
the charged leptons are mass diagonal. An assumed non-vanishing mass of every
ultralight neutrino and the observed non-decoupling of any neutrino generation
allow a maximum of four zeros in the Yukawa coupling matrix $Y_\nu$ in family
space. There are seventy two such textures. We show that the requirement of an
exact $\mu\tau$ symmetry, coupled with the observational constraints, reduces
these seventy two allowed textures to only four corresponding to just two
different forms of the light neutrino mass matrix $M_{\nu A}/M_{\nu B}$,
resulting in an inverted/normal mass ordering. The effect of each of these on
measurable quantities can be described, apart from an overall factor of the
neutrino mass scale, in terms of two real parameters and a phase angle all of
which are within very constrained ranges. The masses and Majorana phases of
ultralight neutrinos are predicted within definite ranges with $3\sigma$
laboratory and cosmological observational inputs. The rate for $0\nu\beta\beta$
decay, though generally below the reach of planned experiments, could approach
it in some parameteric regions. Within the same framework, we also study Yukawa
textures with a fewer number of zeros, but with exact $\mu\tau$ symmetry. We
further formulate the detailed scheme of the explicit breaking of $\mu\tau$
symmetry in terms of three small parameters for allowed four zero textures. The
observed sizable mixing between the first and third generations of neutrinos is
shown to follow for a suitable choice of these symmetry breaking parameters.

a periodic potential for a DW the gradient of which exerts variable pressure on

18.5 GPa is predicted for its mechanical stability. All the elastic constants,
bulk modulus, and shear modulus increase upon compression for the three phases
of HfTi. The ductility of the alloy is shown to be well improved with respect
to pure Hf and Ti metals. The Mulliken charge population analysis illustrates
that the increase of the d-band occupancy will stabilize the $\beta$ phase
under pressure. The phonon spectra and phonon density of states are studied
using the supercell approach for the three phases, and the stable nature of
$\alpha$ and $\omega$ phases at ambient pressure are observed, while the
$\beta$ phase is only stable along the [110] direction. With the Gibbs free

in the presence of spontaneously generated coherence (SGC) is theoretically
investigated. The optical properties of the system are studied and it is shown
that the group velocity of light pulse can be controlled by relative phase of
applied fields. By changing the relative phase of applied fields, the group
velocity of light pulse changes from transparent subluminal to the transparent
superluminal light propagation. Thus, the phase-controlled absorption-free
superluminal light propagation is obtained without applying an incoherent laser
fields to the system. The propagation of a weak probe light pulse is studied by
solving the Maxwell's wave equation on numerical grid in space and time.
Moreover, we study the third order self- and cross-Kerr susceptibility of probe
field and calculate the nonlinear cross-phase shift for different values of
intensity of applied fields. In addition, we take into account the effect of
Doppler broadening on the light pulse propagation and it is found that a
suitable choice of laser propagation directions allows us to preserve our
results even in the presence of Doppler effect. It is demonstrated that by
increasing the Doppler width of distribution to the room temperature, the
dispersion changes from transparent subluminal to transparent superluminal
light propagation which is our major motivation for this work.

discrete X-ray sources in the outskirts of early-type galaxies. Based on a
broad sample of 20 galaxies observed with Chandra we detected overdensity of
X-ray sources in their outskirts. The overdensity appears as halos of resolved
sources around the galaxies. These halos are broader than the stellar light,
extending out to at least ~ 10 Re (Re is the effective radius). These halos are
composed of sources fainter than ~5E38 erg/s, whereas the more luminous sources
appear to follow the distribution of the stellar light, suggesting that the
excess source population consists of neutron star binaries. Dividing the galaxy
sample into four groups according to their stellar mass and specific frequency
of globular clusters, we find that the extended halos are present in all groups
except for the low-mass galaxies with low globular cluster content. We propose
that the extended halos may be comprised of two independent components,
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) located in globular clusters (GCs), which are
known to have a wider distribution than the stellar light, and neutron star
(NS) LMXBs kicked out of the main body of the parent galaxy by supernova
explosions. The available deep optical and X-ray data of NGC 4365 support this
conclusion. For this galaxy we identified 60.1+/-10.8 excess sources in the
4-10 Re region of which ~ 40% are located in GCs, whereas ~ 60% are field
LMXBs. We interpret the latter as kicked NS LMXBs. We discuss the implications

the equidistribution method due to Szpiro--Ullmo--Zhang with respect to the

an important contribution to the geometric version of the conjecture. In fact,
by the crucial investigation of the support of the canonical measure on a

of Hadean Ocean. Our hypothetical model suggests that faint young sun condition
probably provided susceptible physical conditions for an evolutionary route
from Lipid-World to Protein-RNA World, through an intermediate Lipid-RNA World.
Ancient ribozymes were 'protected' by lipids assuring their survival in
prebiotic ocean. The origin of natural selection ensures transition of
Lipid-RNA World to Protein-RNA World after the origin of ribosome. Assuming the
modern peptidyltransferase as the proto-ribosome structure, we have presented a
hypothetical translation mechanism: proto-ribosome randomly polymerized amino
acids being attached to the inner layer of a lipid-vesicle, using only physical
energies available from our Hadean Ocean model. In accordance to the strategy
of chemical evolution, we also have described the possible evolutionary
behavior of this proto-ribosome, which explains the contemporary
three-dimensional structure of 50S subunit and supports the predictions
regarding the ancient regions of it. It also explains the origin of
membrane-free 'minimal ribosome' in the time of LUCA.

We consider a subspace and a subsystem of the full Hilbert space to implement
the qubit. We test the robustness of these two implementations with respect to
the qubit stability. When performing the noise analysis, we extract the initial

been successfully used for many applications. However, the standard XCS has no
memory mechanism and can only learn optimal policy in Markov environments,
where the optimal action is determined solely by the state of current sensory
input. In practice, most environments are partially observable environments on
agent's sensation, which are also known as non-Markov environments. Within
these environments, XCS either fails, or only develops a suboptimal policy,
since it has no memory. In this work, we develop a new classifier system based
on XCS to tackle this problem. It adds an internal message list to XCS as the
memory list to record input sensation history, and extends a small number of
classifiers with memory conditions. The classifier's memory condition, as a
foothold to disambiguate non-Markov states, is used to sense a specified
element in the memory list. Besides, a detection method is employed to
recognize non-Markov states in environments, to avoid these states controlling
over classifiers' memory conditions. Furthermore, four sets of different
complex maze environments have been tested by the proposed method. Experimental
results show that our system is one of the best techniques to solve partially
observable environments, compared with some well-known classifier systems
proposed for these environments.

massive pseudo-Dirac fermion with mass in the few hundred GeV range and mass
splitting of about 100 keV, its lighter component can be a viable inelastic
dark matter candidate. Its relic abundance is produced by the CP violating
out-of-equilibrium decay of the type-II seesaw scalar triplet, which also gives
rise to the required baryon asymmetry of the Universe via type-II leptogenesis,
thus providing a simultaneous explanation of dark matter and baryon abundance
observed today. Moreover, the induced vacuum expectation value of the same
scalar triplet is responsible for the sub-eV Majorana masses to the three
active neutrinos. A stable fourth generation of neutrinos is elusive at
collider, however might be detected by current dark matter direct search
experiments.

Surprisingly, multi-task learning can be asymptotically essentially useless, in
the sense that examples from other tasks help only when the degree of

is most extreme for learning of smooth target functions as described by e.g.
squared exponential kernels. We also demonstrate that when learning many tasks,
the learning curves separate into an initial phase, where the Bayes error on

the number of examples is proportional to the number of tasks.

observations of crowded stellar fields with integral field spectroscopy (IFS).
Our approach extends the well-established concept of crowded field photometry
in images into the domain of 3-dimensional spectroscopic datacubes. The main
features of our algorithm are: (1) We assume that a high-fidelity input source
catalogue already exists and that it is not needed to perform sophisticated
source detection in the IFS data. (2) Source positions and properties of the
point spread function (PSF) vary smoothly between spectral layers of the
datacube, and these variations can be described by simple fitting functions.
(3) The shape of the PSF can be adequately described by an analytical function.
Even without isolated PSF calibrator stars we can therefore estimate the PSF by
a model fit to the full ensemble of stars visible within the field of view. (4)
By using sparse matrices to describe the sources, the problem of extracting the
spectra of many stars simultaneously becomes computationally tractable. We
present extensive performance and validation tests of our algorithm using
realistic simulated datacubes that closely reproduce actual IFS observations of
the central regions of Galactic globular clusters. We investigate the quality
of the extracted spectra under the effects of crowding. The main effect of
blending between two nearby stars is a decrease in the S/N in their spectra.
The effect increases with the crowding in the field in a way that the maximum
number of stars with useful spectra is always ~0.2 per spatial resolution
element. This balance breaks down when exceeding a total source density of ~1
significantly detected star per resolution element. We close with an outlook by
applying our method to a simulated globular cluster observation with the
upcoming MUSE instrument at the ESO-VLT.

describe in detail the procedure to point the star nearest to the North
celestial pole. This was made to align a sphere equipped with tubes to observe
the celestial pole, the polar circles, the solstices and equinoxes. The use of
tubes in astronomical observation is later reported by Alhazen in his treatise
on optics (1011-1021). The description of pointing to the celestial pole
indicates that the instrument must be accurately aligned with the true pole,
materialized at that epoch by a star of fifth magnitude, at the limit of naked
eye visibility, and then the instrument must remain fixed. Solstices and
Equinoxes are points of the orbit of the Sun, so the sphere could be used as a
tool for observing the Sun and probably determine the duration of the tropical
year. This sphere was much more than a didactic tool, given the long procedure
for the accurate alignement. Moreover ""Rogatus a pluribus"" (asked by his many
students), Gerbert wrote a treatise on acoustic tubes (fistulae) in 980:
Mensura Fistularum. He knew the difference in behavior of the fistulae compared
with the acoustic strings, already studied by the Pythagoreans, and the treaty
is intended to present the law that governs the length of the organ pipes in
two octaves, compared to the corresponding acoustic strings. In terms of modern
physics we know that acoustic tubes require an ""end correction"" to be tuned,
which is proportional to the diameter of the tube. This proportionality is the
same for every note. The mathematical law is simple, but Gerbert preferred to
create a law in which the proportions of pipes and strings should be calculated
through a series of fractions linked to the number 12 and its multiples.

at which an externally excited vibration mode decays due to its interaction

affects the Q of longitudinal modes, and may also be of significance to the
damping of flexural modes in otherwise high-Q beams. The finite geometry of the
beam is manifested in two important ways. Its finite length breaks translation
invariance along the beam and introduces an imperfect momentum conservation law
in place of the exact law. Its finite width imposes a quantization of the
electronic states that introduces a temperature scale for which there exists a
crossover from a high-temperature macroscopic regime, where electron-phonon
damping behaves as if the electrons were in the bulk, to a low-temperature
mesoscopic regime, where damping is dominated by just a few dissipation
channels and exhibits sharp non-monotonic changes as parameters are varied.

up to 0.8 eV enables efficient control of its complex dielectric constant,
which allows modulation of the cavity reflection in excess of 10 dB for a swing
voltage of only 1.5 V. We also observe a controllable resonance wavelength
shift close to 2 nm around a wavelength of 1570 nm and a Q factor modulation in
excess of three. These observations allow cavity-enhanced measurements of the
graphene complex dielectric constant under different chemical potentials, in
agreement with a theoretical model of the graphene dielectric constant under

of high-contrast, low-power frequency-selective electro-optic nanocavity

reliable inference of magnetic fields on the Sun. For ground based
observations, polarimetric precision is severely limited by the presence of
Earth's atmosphere. Atmospheric turbulence (seeing) produces signal
fluctuations which combined with the non-simultaneous nature of the measurement
process cause intermixing of the Stokes parameters known as seeing induced
polarization cross-talk. Previous analysis of this effect (Judge et al., 2004)
suggests that cross-talk is reduced not only with increase in modulation
frequency but also by compensating the seeing induced image aberrations by an
Adaptive Optics (AO) system. However, in those studies the effect of higher
order image aberrations than those corrected by the AO system was not taken
into account. We present in this paper an analysis of seeing induced cross-talk
in the presence of higher order image aberrations through numerical simulation.
In this analysis we find that the amount of cross-talk among Stokes parameters
is practically independent of the degree of image aberration corrected by an AO
system. However, higher order AO corrections increase the signal-to-noise ratio
by reducing the seeing caused image smearing.

that in the long range limit they satisfy a system of paraxial equations driven

mode-dependent scales: the scattering mean free path, the cross-range
decoherence length and the decoherence frequency. Understanding these scales is
important in imaging and communication problems, because they encode the

at near detectors placed at 280 m from the production target and at the far

is an essential part of the successful prediction of neutrino interaction rates

produce neutrinos. The simulation uses proton beam monitor measurements as
inputs. The modeling of hadronic interactions is re-weighted using thin target
hadron production data, including recent charged pion and kaon measurements
from the NA61/SHINE experiment. For the first T2K analyses the uncertainties on
the flux prediction are evaluated to be below 15% near the flux peak. The
uncertainty on the ratio of the flux predictions at the far and near detectors

radio continuum of the HII region, and HI emission arising from the Orion Bar
photon-dominated region (PDR) and from the Orion-KL outflow. In the Orion Bar
PDR, the HI signal peaks in the same layer as the H2 near-infrared vibrational
line emission, in agreement with models of the photodissociation of H2. The gas
temperature in this region is approximately 540K, and the HI abundance in the
interclump gas in the PDR is 5-10% of the available hydrogen nuclei. Most of
the gas in this region therefore remains molecular. Mechanical feedback on the
Veil manifests itself through the interaction of ionized flow systems in the
Orion Nebula, in particular the Herbig-Haro object HH202, with the Veil. These
interactions give rise to prominent blueward velocity shifts of the gas in the
Veil. The unambiguous evidence for interaction of this flow system with the
Veil shows that the distance between the Veil and the Trapezium stars needs to
be revised downwards to about 0.4pc. The depth of the ionized cavity is about
0.7pc, which is much smaller than the depth and the lateral extent of the Veil.
Our results reaffirm the blister model for the M42 HII region, while also
revealing its relation to the neutral environment on a larger scale.

be a phase transition with increasing disorder to a state where no transport
occurs. This transition was first discussed by Anderson in 1958 in the context
of the metal insulator transition, but as was realized later it is generic for
all waves . However, the quest for the experimental demonstration of ""Anderson""
or ""strong"" localization of waves in 3D has been a challenging task. For
electrons and cold atoms, the challenge lies in the possibility of bound states
in a disordered potential well. Therefore, electromagnetic and acoustic waves
have been the prime candidates for the observation of Anderson localization.
The main challenge using light lies in the distinction between effects of
absorption and localization. Here we present measurements of the
time-dependence of the transverse width of the intensity distribution of the
transmitted waves, which provides a direct measure of the localization length
and is independent of absorption. From this we find direct evidence for a
localization transition in three dimensions and determine the corresponding

anisotropic liquids, which leads to thermoelectric conversion of energy.
Nematic liquid crystals with semiconducting dopes are used. A thermoelectric
figure of merit ZT = 0.2 is obtained in experiments. The effect can be
explained by assuming that the thermocurrent in semiconducting nematics, in
contrast to the Seebeck effect, is a nonlinear function of the temperature
gradient and of the temperature itself. Though the discovered effect has to be
further investigated, the data obtained suggest that it can be effectively used
in alternative energy engineering.

of p the final state, attained by the growth procedure, exhibits a cluster of
occupied sites that spans the entire lattice. Using numerical simulations we
investigate the percolation probability and the order parameter and perform a

work and provide a full classification. In particular, we show that the case
when actions have no preconditions and at most $e$ postconditions is
fixed-parameter tractable if $e\leq 2$ and W[1]-complete otherwise. We show
fixed-parameter tractability by a reduction to a variant of the Steiner Tree
problem; this problem has been shown fixed-parameter tractable by Guo et al.
(2007). If a problem is fixed-parameter tractable, then it admits a
polynomial-time self-reduction to instances whose input size is bounded by a
function of the parameter, called the kernel. For some problems, this function
is even polynomial which has desirable computational implications. Recent
research in parameterized complexity has focused on classifying fixed-parameter
tractable problems on whether they admit polynomial kernels or not. We revisit
all the previously obtained restrictions of planning that are fixed-parameter
tractable and show that none of them admits a polynomial kernel unless the
polynomial hierarchy collapses to its third level.

infectious disease spread from person to person. Vaccination dramatically
disrupts the disease transmission process on a contact network, and indeed,
sufficiently high vaccination rates can disrupt the process to such an extent
that disease transmission on the network is effectively halted. Here, we build
on mounting evidence that health behaviors - such as vaccination, and refusal
thereof - can spread through social networks through a process of complex
contagion that requires social reinforcement. Using network simulations that
model both the health behavior and the infectious disease spread, we find that
under otherwise identical conditions, the process by which the health behavior
spreads has a very strong effect on disease outbreak dynamics. This variability
in dynamics results from differences in the topology within susceptible
communities that arise during the health behavior spreading process, which in
turn depends on the topology of the overall social network. Our findings point
to the importance of health behavior spread in predicting and controlling
disease outbreaks.

method for the space inhomogeneous Boltzmann equation developed by Gamba and
Tharkabhushaman. This approach is a two-step process that acts on the weak form
of the Boltzmann equation, and uses the machinery of the Fourier transform to
reformulate the collisional integral into a weighted convolution in Fourier
space. A constrained optimization problem is solved to preserve the mass,
momentum, and energy of the resulting distribution. We extend this method to
second order accuracy in space and time, and explore how to leverage the
structure of the collisional formulation for high performance computing
environments. The locality in space of the collisional term provides a
straightforward memory decomposition, and we perform some initial scaling tests
on high performance computing resources. We also use the improved computational
power of this method to investigate a boundary-layer generated shock problem
that cannot be described by classical hydrodynamics.

collusion in online rating systems and asses their susceptibility to collusion
attacks. The proposed model uses a frequent itemset mining algorithm to detect
candidate collusion groups. Then, several indicators are used for identifying
