disc's thermodynamics. In discs where the viscous heating is balanced by
radiative transport, the migration can be directed outwards, a process which
extends the lifetime of growing planetary embryos. We investigate the influence
of opacity and stellar irradiation on the disc thermodynamics. Utilizing the
resulting disc structure, we determine the regions of outward migration. We
perform two-dimensional numerical simulations of equilibrium discs with viscous
heating, radiative cooling and stellar irradiation. We use the hydrodynamical
code NIRVANA that includes a full tensor viscosity and stellar irradiation, as
well as a two temperature solver that includes radiation transport in the
flux-limited diffusion approximation. The migration is studied by using torque
formulae. In the constant opacity case, we reproduce the analytical results of
a black-body disc: the stellar irradiation dominates in the outer regions --
leading to flaring -- while the viscous heating dominates close to the star. We
find that the inner edge of the disc should not be significantly puffed-up by
the stellar irradiation. If the opacity depends on the local density and
temperature, the structure of the disc is different, and several bumps in the
aspect ratio H/r appear, due to transitions between different opacity regimes.
The bumps in the disc can shield the outer disc from stellar irradiation.
Stellar irradiation is an important factor for determining the disc structure
and has dramatic consequences for the migration of embedded planets. Compared
to discs with only viscous heating, a stellar irradiated disc features a much
smaller region of outward migration for a range of planetary masses. This
suggests that the region where the formation of giant planet cores takes place
is smaller, which in turn might lead to a shorter growth phase.

the activity of very large neural ensembles. To understand how large ensembles
of neurons process sensory information, it is necessary to develop suitable
statistical models to describe the response variability of the recorded spike
trains. Using the information geometry framework, it is possible to estimate
higher-order correlations by assigning one interaction parameter to each degree
of correlation, leading to a $(2^N-1)$-dimensional model for a population with
$N$ neurons. However, this model suffers greatly from a combinatorial
explosion, and the number of parameters to be estimated from the available
sample size constitutes the main intractability reason of this approach. To
quantify the extent of higher than pairwise spike correlations in pools of
multiunit activity, we use an information-geometric approach within the
framework of the extended central limit theorem considering all possible
contributions from high-order spike correlations. The identification of a
deformation parameter allows us to provide a statistical characterisation of
the amount of high-order correlations in the case of a very large neural
ensemble, significantly reducing the number of parameters, avoiding the
sampling problem, and inferring the underlying dynamical properties of the
network within pools of multiunit neural activity.

sensitivity and dynamic range, the Herschel images reveal the structure of the
dense, star-forming filament B211 with unprecedented detail, along with the
presence of striations perpendicular to the filament and generally oriented
along the magnetic field direction as traced by optical polarization vectors.
Based on the column density and dust temperature maps derived from the Herschel
data, we find that the radial density profile of the B211 filament approaches a
power-law behavior {\rho} {\propto} r^(-2.0{\pm}0.4) at large radii and that
the temperature profile exhibits a marked drop at small radii. The observed
density and temperature profiles of the B211 filament are in good agreement
with a theoretical model of a cylindrical filament undergoing gravitational
contraction with a polytropic equation of state: P {\propto} {\rho}^{\gamma}
and T {\propto} {\rho}^({\gamma}-1), with {\gamma}=0.97{\pm}0.01<1 (i.e. not
strictly isothermal). The morphology of the column density map, where some of
the perpendicular striations are apparently connected to the B211 filament,
further suggests that the material may be accreting along the striations onto
the main filament. The typical velocities expected for the infalling material

C, revised manuscript",,"10.1103/PhysRevC.87.014337",,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Mixed-symmetry 2+ states in vibrational nuclei are characterized
by a sign change between dominant proton and neutron valence-shell components
with respect to the fully symmetric 2+ state. The sign can be measured by a
decomposition of proton and neutron transition radii with a combination of
inelastic electron and hadron scattering [C. Walz et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 106,
062501 (2011)]. For the case of 92Zr, a difference could be experimentally
established for the neutron components, while about equal proton transition
radii were indicated by the data. Method: Differential cross sections for the
excitation of one-phonon 2+ and 3- states in 92Zr have been measured with the
(e,e') reaction at the S-DALINAC in a momentum transfer range q = 0.3-0.6
fm^(-1). Results: Transition strengths B(E2;2+_1 -> 0+_1) = 6.18(23), B(E2;
2+_2 -> 0+_1) = 3.31(10) and B(E3; 3-_1 -> 0+_1) = 18.4(11) Weisskopf units are
determined from a comparison of the experimental cross sections to
quasiparticle-phonon model (QPM) calculations. It is shown that a
model-independent plane wave Born approximation (PWBA) analysis can fix the
ratio of B(E2) transition strengths to the 2+_(1,2) states with a precision of
about 1%. The method furthermore allows to extract their proton transition
radii difference. With the present data -0.12(51) fm is obtained. Conclusions:
Electron scattering at low momentum transfers can provide information on
transition radii differences of one-phonon 2+ states even in heavy nuclei.
Proton transition radii for the 2+_(1,2) states in 92Zr are found to be
identical within uncertainties. The g.s. transition probability for the
mixed-symmetry state can be determined with high precision limited only by the
available experimental information on the B(E2; 2+_1 -> 0+_1) value.

second erases the stored information. Beats appear in the time-delayed
photon-photon coincidence rate (intensity correlation function). We study the
beats theoretically and experimentally as a function of system parameters, and
find them remarkably robust against perturbations such as spontaneous emission.

outcomes of the XX century physics. The consideration of entanglement between
the quantum states of two or more universes in a multiverse scenario provides
us with a completely new paradigm that opens the door to novel approaches for
traditionally unsolved problems in cosmology. More precisely, the problems of
the cosmological constant, the arrow of time and the choice of boundary
conditions, among others. It also encourages us to adopt new points of view
about major philosophical ideas. In this chapter, we shall present the main
features that may characterize inter-universal entanglement and it will be
addressed the customary problems of cosmology from the new perspective that the
quantum multiverse scenario supplies us with.
  In summary, the appropriate boundary condition that has to be imposed on the
quantum state of the whole multiverse allows us to interpret it as made up of
entangled pairs of universes. Then, a quantum thermodynamical description of
single universes can be given and it can be shown that it may induce observable
effects in the energy properties of the Universe. The effects that the boundary
condition of the multiverse has on the vacuum energy and the arrow of time of
single universes are also studied. As a consequence of inter-universal
entanglement, the former might be discriminated from observational data and the
latter would favor the growth of cosmic structures that increase the amount of
local entropy mainly in the very early phase of the universe. All these
characteristics of inter-universal entanglement would eventually impel us to
develop the concept of the physical multiverse, one for which the theory could
be not only fallible but also indirectly observed.

algorithm stucks on q-forms, then it produces a variety of holomorphic

identifies correctly LaTiO$_{3}$ in the magnetic sates as a Mott insulator.
Also, it predicts that the GdFeO$_{3}$-type distortion in non-magnetic
LaTiO$_{3}$ will induce a large $\Delta_{CF}$ of 410 meV. This large
crystal-field splitting associated with the large magnetic moment found in the
G-type antiferromagnetic state suggest that LaTiO$_{3}$ has an induced orbital
order, which is confirmed by the visualisation of the highest occupied
orbitals. These results strongly indicate that HSE06 is capable of efficiently

the physics at their heterointerfaces.

exposed, and some particular solutions are given. For instance, we obtain as
geodesic trajectories some circular helices (depending on an angular velocity
\omega), certain circles situated in some planes (ones are parallel with xOy,
and other ones are orthogonal on xOy), or some straight lines which are
parallel with the axis Oz. All these geometrical geodesics are very specific
because they are completely determined by the non-constant index of refraction
n(x).

result is Grauert's classification of principal holomorphic fiber bundles over
Stein spaces. Modern Oka theory concerns holomorphic maps from Stein manifolds
and Stein spaces to Oka manifolds. It has emerged as a subfield of complex
geometry in its own right since the appearance of a seminal paper of M. Gromov
in 1989.
  In this expository paper we discuss Oka manifolds and Oka maps. We describe
equivalent characterizations of Oka manifolds, the functorial properties of
this class, and geometric sufficient conditions for being Oka, the most
important of which is Gromov's ellipticity. We survey the current status of the
theory in terms of known examples of Oka manifolds, mention open problems and
outline the proofs of the main results.
  In the appendix by F. Larusson it is explained how Oka manifolds and Oka
maps, along with Stein manifolds, fit into an abstract homotopy-theoretic
framework.

that osteocytes play important roles in the cycle of targeted bone remodeling,
in serving as a significant source of RANKL to support osteoclastogenesis, and
in secreting the bone formation inhibitor sclerostin. Moreover, there is also

possibility of RANKL expression by osteocyte cell populations. This model
extends and complements many of the existing mathematical models for bone

discussed in depth. Two types of lower bounds, the constrained Cram\'{e}r-Rao
bound (CCRB) and the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound (HCRB), are discussed. It
is shown that the situation with sensing matrix perturbation is more complex
than the one with only measurement noise. For the CCRB, its closed-form
expression is deduced. It demonstrates a gap between the maximal and nonmaximal

\theta > 70 degrees and a hot, ionized wind of lower density at lower
inclinations. The dynamical pressure of the hot wind is important in shaping
the denser IR supported flow. At luminosities <0.1 L_edd episodes of outflow
are followed by extended periods when the wind switches to slow accretion.

We investigate the statistics of the spatial and temporal
distribution of the coronal heating in a three-dimensional magneto-
hydrodynamical (3D MHD) model. The model describes the temporal evolution of
the corona above an observed active region. The model is driven by photospheric
granular motions which braid the magnetic field lines. This induces currents
and their dissipation heats the plasma. We evaluate the transient heating as
subsequent heating events and analyze their statistics. The results are then
interpreted in the context of observed flare statistics and coronal heating
mechanisms. Methods. To conduct the numerical experiment we use a high order
finite difference code which solves the partial differential equations for the
conservation of mass, the momentum and energy balance, and the induction
equation. The energy balance includes the Spitzer heat conduction and the
optical thin radiative loss in the corona. Results. The temporal and spatial
distribution of the Ohmic heating in the 3D MHD model follow a power law and
can therefore be explained by system in a self-organized critical state. The
slopes of the power law are similar to the results based on flare observations.
We find that the corona is heated foot point dominated and the coronal heating
is dominated by events called nanoflares with energies on the order of 1017 J.

presence of a classical electromagnetic (background) current, j, in a generally
covariant way on arbitrary globally hyperbolic spacetimes M. By carefully
following general principles and procedures we clarify a number of topological
issues. First we combine the interpretation of A as a connection on a principal
U(1)-bundle with the perspective of general covariance to deduce a physical
gauge equivalence relation, which is intimately related to the Aharonov-Bohm
effect. By Peierls' method we subsequently find a Poisson bracket on the space
of local, affine observables of the theory. This Poisson bracket is in general
degenerate, leading to a quantum theory with non-local behaviour. We show that
this non-local behaviour can be fully explained in terms of Gauss' law. Thus
our analysis establishes a relationship, via the Poisson bracket, between the
Aharonov-Bohm effect and Gauss' law (a relationship which seems to have gone
unnoticed so far). Furthermore, we find a formula for the space of electric
monopole charges in terms of the topology of the underlying spacetime. Because
it costs little extra effort, we emphasise the cohomological perspective and
derive our results for general p-form fields A (p < dim(M)), modulo exact
fields. In conclusion we note that the theory is not locally covariant, in the
sense of Brunetti-Fredenhagen-Verch. It is not possible to obtain such a theory
by dividing out the centre of the algebras, nor is it physically desirable to
do so. Instead we argue that electromagnetism forces us to weaken the axioms of
the framework of local covariance, because the failure of locality is
physically well-understood and should be accommodated.

lensing magnification ensures that our sample spans an unprecedented range of
stellar mass (3*10^{7}-6*10^{10} M_sun). We find that at the median redshift of

cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with momentum driven winds. We find that
the model metallicity is consistent with the observed metallicity within the

nature of the latter, it was thought for nearly a decade that SIDM would be
viable only if the cross section for self-scattering was strongly
velocity-dependent. However, it has recently been suggested that a constant

at a fixed frequency f>>c^3/GM. This will happen if the time domain waveform or
its derivative exhibits a discontinuity. Ground based instruments could search
for these universal spectral tails to detect or rule out such features
irrespective of their origin. We identify the following processes which may
generate high frequency signals: (i) gravitational bremsstrahlung of
ultrarelativistic objects in the vicinity of a SMBH, (ii) ringdown modes
excited by an external process that has a high frequency component or
terminates abruptly, (iii) gravitational lensing echos and diffraction. In
particular for (iii), SMBHs produce GW echos of inspiraling stellar mass
binaries in galactic nuclei with a delay of a few minutes to hours. The lensed
primary signal and GW echo are amplified if the binary is within a ~10 deg
(r/100M)^{-1/2} cone behind the SMBH relative to the line of sight at distance
r from the SMBH. For the rest of the binaries near SMBHs, the amplitude of the
GW echo is ~0.1 (r/100M)^{-1} of the primary signal on average.

subsequent violent relaxation and dissipation. The empirical scaling relations
are thus important for distinguishing between various theoretical models of
galaxy evolution, and they further form the basis for all black hole mass
measurements at large distances. In particular, observations have shown that
the mass of the black hole is typically 0.1% of the stellar bulge mass of the

barrier to accretion onto massive stars can be circumvented, when the radiation
field is highly anisotropic in the presence of a circumstellar accretion disk
with high optical depth. Here, these studies of the so-called flashlight effect
are expanded by including the opacity of the innermost dust-free but
potentially optically thick gas regions around forming massive stars. In
addition to frequency-dependent opacities for the dust grains, we use
temperature- and density-dependent Planck- and Rosseland mean opacities for the
gas. The simulations show that the innermost dust-free parts of the accretion
disks are optically thick to the stellar radiation over a substantial fraction
of the solid angle above and below the disk's midplane. The temperature in the
shielded disk region decreases faster with radius than in a comparison
simulation with a lower constant gas opacity, and the dust sublimation front is
shifted to smaller radii. The shielding by the dust-free gas in the inner disk
thus contributes to an enhanced flashlight effect, which ultimately results in
a smaller opening angle of the radiation pressure driven outflow and in a much
longer timescale of sustained feeding of the circumstellar disk by the
molecular cloud core. We conclude that it is necessary to properly account for
the opacity of the inner dust-free disk regions around forming massive stars in
order to correctly assess the effectiveness of the flashlight effect, the
opening angle of radiation pressure driven outflows, and the lifetime and
morphological evolution of the accretion disk.

density functions (PDFs) of the density and the column density in our
simulations with solenoidal, mixed, and compressive forcing of the turbulence,
sonic Mach numbers of 3-50, and magnetic fields in the super- to the
trans-Alfvenic regime, all develop power-law tails of flattening slope with
increasing SFE. The high-density tails of the PDFs are consistent with
equivalent radial density profiles, rho ~ r^(-kappa) with kappa ~ 1.5-2.5, in
agreement with observations. Studying velocity-size scalings, we find that all
the simulations are consistent with the observed v ~ l^(1/2) scaling of
supersonic turbulence, and seem to approach Kolmogorov turbulence with v ~
l^(1/3) below the sonic scale. The velocity-size scaling is, however, largely
independent of the SFE. In contrast, the density-size and column density-size
scalings are highly sensitive to star formation. We find that the power-law
slope alpha of the density power spectrum, P(rho,k) ~ k^alpha, or equivalently
the Delta-variance spectrum of column density, DV(Sigma,l) ~ l^(-alpha),
switches sign from alpha < 0 for SFE ~ 0 to alpha > 0 when star formation
proceeds (SFE > 0). We provide a relation to compute the SFE from a measurement
of alpha. Studying the literature, we find values ranging from alpha = -1.6 to
+1.6 in observations covering scales from the large-scale atomic medium, over
cold molecular clouds, down to dense star-forming cores. From those alpha
values, we infer SFEs and find good agreement with independent measurements

density map of a cloud alone, without requiring a priori knowledge of

the cosmological model and the true nature of dark energy with unprecedented
accuracy. In order for these surveys to achieve their designed goals, they will
require predictions for the nonlinear matter power spectrum to sub-percent
accuracy. Through the use of a large ensemble of cosmological N-body
simulations, we demonstrate that if we do not understand the uncertainties
associated with simulating structure formation, i.e. knowledge of the `true'
simulation parameters, and simply seek to marginalize over them, then the
constraining power of such future surveys can be significantly reduced.
However, for the parameters {n_s, h, Om_b, Om_m}, this effect can be largely
mitigated by adding the information from a CMB experiment, like Planck. In
contrast, for the amplitude of fluctuations sigma8 and the time-evolving
equation of state of dark energy {w_0, w_a}, the mitigation is mild. On
marginalizing over the simulation parameters, we find that the dark-energy
figure of merit can be degraded by ~2. This is likely an optimistic assessment,
since we do not take into account other important simulation parameters. A
caveat is our assumption that the Hessian of the likelihood function does not
vary significantly when moving from our adopted to the 'true' simulation
parameter set. This paper therefore provides strong motivation for rigorous
convergence testing of N-body codes to meet the future challenges of precision

the shallowest layers of the exploding white dwarf, which can provide
constraints on the progenitor star and the properties of the explosive burning.
We use semi-analytic models of radioactively-powered rising lightcurves to
analyze these observations. As we have summarized in previous work, the main
limiting factor in determining the surface distribution of 56Ni is the lack of
an unambiguously identified time of explosion, as would be provided by
detection of shock breakout or shock-heated cooling. Without this the SN may in
principle exhibit a ""dark phase"" for a few hours to days, where the only
emission is from shock-heated cooling that is too dim to be detected. We show
that by assuming a theoretically-motivated time-dependent velocity evolution,
the explosion time can be better constrained, albeit with potential systematic
uncertainties. This technique is used to infer the surface 56Ni distributions
of three recent SNe Ia that were caught especially early in their rise. In all
three we find fairly similar 56Ni distributions. Observations of SN 2011fe and
SN 2012cg probe shallower depths than SN 2009ig, and in these two cases 56Ni is

is up to an order of magnitude given the difficulty of precisely constraining
the explosion time. We also use our conclusions about the explosion times to
reassess radius constraints for the progenitor of SN 2011fe, as well as discuss

find that strong-emission-line sources (`high-excitation radio galaxies') have,
on average, a factor ~4 higher 250-micron Herschel luminosity than weak-line
(`low-excitation') radio galaxies and are also more luminous than
magnitude-matched radio-quiet galaxies at the same redshift. Using all five
H-ATLAS bands, we show that this difference in luminosity between the
emission-line classes arises mostly from a difference in the average dust
temperature; strong-emission-line sources tend to have comparable dust masses
to, but higher dust temperatures than, radio galaxies with weak emission lines.
We interpret this as showing that radio galaxies with strong nuclear emission
lines are much more likely to be associated with star formation in their host
galaxy, although there is certainly not a one-to-one relationship between star
formation and strong-line AGN activity. The strong-line sources are estimated
to have star-formation rates at least a factor 3-4 higher than those in the
weak-line objects. Our conclusion is consistent with earlier work, generally
carried out using much smaller samples, and reinforces the general picture of
high-excitation radio galaxies as being located in lower-mass, less evolved

the metallicity of the progenitor stars. In particular, massive metal-poor
stars (Z<=0.3 Zsun) are enabled to form massive stellar black holes (MSBHs,

cent of simulated MSBHs form from single stars and become members of binaries
through dynamical exchanges in the first 100 Myr of the SC life. This is a
factor of >~3 more efficient than in the case of low-mass (<25 Msun) stellar
black holes. A small but non-negligible fraction of MSBHs power wind-accreting

The vast majority of MSBH binaries that undergo wind accretion and/or RLO were

a generating functional of gauge and gravitational sources. Much of our focus
is on the simple example of a free massive Dirac fermion, the so-called Chern
insulator, especially in 2+1 dimensions. In such cases, when parity and
time-reversal symmetry are broken, it is necessary to consider the
gravitational sources to include a frame and an independent spin connection
with torsion. In 2+1 dimensions, the simplest parity-odd response is the Hall
viscosity. We compute the Hall viscosity of the Chern insulator using a careful
regularization scheme, and find that although the Hall viscosity is generally
divergent, the difference in Hall viscosities of distinct topological phases is
well-defined and determined by the mass gap. Furthermore, on a 1+1-dimensional
edge between topological phases, the jump in the Hall viscosity across the
interface is encoded, through familiar anomaly inflow mechanisms, in the
structure of anomalies. In particular, we find new torsional contributions to
the covariant diffeomorphism anomaly in 1+1 dimensions. Including parity-even
contributions, we find that the renormalized generating functionals of the two
topological phases differ by a chiral gravity action with a negative
cosmological constant. This (non-dynamical) chiral gravity action and the
corresponding physics of the interface theory is reminiscent of well-known
properties of dynamical holographic gravitational systems. Finally, we consider
some properties of spectral flow of the edge theory driven by torsional
dislocations.

NW limb has predominantly thermal X-ray emission, and it is the only location
in SN1006 with significant optical emission: a thin, Balmer-dominated filament.
For most of the NW rim, the proper motion is about 0.30 arcsec/yr, essentially
the same as has been measured from the H-alpha filament. Isolated regions of
the NW limb are dominated by nonthermal emission, and here the proper motion is
much higher, 0.49 arcsec/yr, close to the value measured in X-rays along the
much brighter NE limb, where the X-rays are overwhelmingly nonthermal. At the
2.2 kpc distance to SN1006, the proper motions imply shock velocities of about
3000 km/s and 5000 km/s in the thermal and nonthermal regions, respectively. A
lower velocity behind the H-alpha filament is consistent with the picture that
SN1006 is encountering denser gas in the NW, as is also suggested by its
overall morphology. In the thermally-dominated portion of the X-ray shell, we
also see an offset in the radial profiles at different energies; the 0.5-0.6
keV peak dominated by O VII is closer to the shock front than that of the 0.8-3
keV emission--due to the longer times for heavier elements to reach ionization
states where they produce strong X-ray emission.

in the southern hemisphere, is carried out with the CORALIE echelle
spectrograph at La Silla Observatory. With an observing time span of more than
14 years, the CORALIE survey is now able to unveil Jovian planets on Jupiter's
period domain. This growing period-interval coverage is important regarding to
formation and migration models since observational constraints are still weak
for periods beyond the ice line. Long-term precise Doppler measurements with
the CORALIE echelle spectrograph, together with a few additional observations
made with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6m telescope, reveal radial
velocity signatures of massive planetary companions in long period orbits. In
this paper we present seven new planets orbiting HD27631, HD98649, HD106515A,
HD166724, HD196067, HD219077, and HD220689 together with the CORALIE orbital
parameters for three already known planets around HD10647, HD30562, and
HD86226. The period range of the new planetary companions goes from 2200 to
5500 days and covers a mass domain between 1 and 10.5 MJup. Surprisingly, five
of them present quite high eccentricities above e>0.57. A pumping scenario by
Kozai mechanism may be invoked for HD106515Ab and HD196067b which are both
orbiting stars in multiple systems. As the presence of a third massive body
can't be inferred from the data of HD98649b, HD166724b, and HD219077b, the
origin of the eccentricity of these systems remains unknown. Except for
HD10647b, no constraint on the upper mass of the planets is provided by
Hipparcos astrometric data. Finally it is interesting to note that the hosts of
these long period planets show no metallicity excess.

suggests the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for mixture model selection.
However, the BIC has well-known limitations, including a tendency to
overestimate the number of components as well as a proclivity for, often
drastically, underestimating the number of components in higher dimensions.
While the former problem might be soluble through merging components, the
latter is impossible to mitigate in clustering and classification applications.
In this paper, a LASSO-penalized BIC (LPBIC) is introduced to overcome this

mixtures of factor analyzers, where the LPBIC is used to select both the number

antiferromagnetic/orthorhombic phase is suppressed, typically by introduction
of dopant atoms. But their impact on atomic-scale electronic structure, while
in theory quite complex, is unknown experimentally. What is known is that a
strong transport anisotropy with its resistivity maximum along the crystal
b-axis, develops with increasing concentration of dopant atoms; this
`nematicity' vanishes when the `parent' phase disappears near the maximum
superconducting Tc. The interplay between the electronic structure surrounding
each dopant atom, quasiparticle scattering therefrom, and the transport
nematicity has therefore become a pivotal focus of research into these
materials. Here, by directly visualizing the atomic-scale electronic structure,
we show that substituting Co for Fe atoms in underdoped Ca(Fe1-xCox)2As2
generates a dense population of identical anisotropic impurity states. Each is
~8 Fe-Fe unit cells in length, and all are distributed randomly but aligned
with the antiferromagnetic a-axis. By imaging their surrounding interference
patterns, we further demonstrate that these impurity states scatter
quasiparticles in a highly anisotropic manner, with the maximum scattering rate
concentrated along the b-axis. These data provide direct support for the recent
proposals that it is primarily anisotropic scattering by dopant-induced
impurity states that generates the transport nematicity; they also yield simple
explanations for the enhancement of the nematicity proportional to the dopant
density and for the occurrence of the highest resistivity along the b-axis.

briefly presented. Aperture Arrays re-entered the world of radio astronomy as
the idea to build a huge radio telescope with a collecting area of one square
kilometre (the Square Kilometre Array, SKA) arose. Huge ICT technology advances
had transformed Aperture Arrays in terms of their capability, flexibility and
reliability. In the mid-1990s, ASTRON started to develop and experiment with
the first high frequency aperture array tiles for radio astronomy - AAD, OSMA,
THEA & EMBRACE. In the slipstream of these efforts, Phased Array Feeds (PAFs)
for radio astronomy were invented and LOFAR itself emerged as a next generation
telescope and a major pathfinder for the SKA. Meanwhile, the same advantages
that aperture arrays offered to radio astronomy had already made dishes
obsolete in many different civilian and military applications. The first
commissioning results from LOFAR and other Aperture Arrays (MWA, LWA and PAPER)
currently demonstrate that this kind of technology can transform radio
astronomy over 2 decades of the radio spectrum, and at frequencies up to at
least 1.5 GHz. This ""reinvention of radio astronomy"" has important implications
for the design and form of the full SKA. Building a SKA that is simply the ""VLA
on steroids"" is simply not good enough. Like the Antikythera mechanism itself,
we must amaze future generations of astronomers - they and the current
generation deserve nothing less.

fission demonstrate the numerical accuracy and practical utility of this

a unified framework of singlet fission, a type of multiexciton generation
producing two triplet excitons from one singlet exciton. In this paper, we
apply our methodology to molecular dimers of pentacene, a widely studied
material that exhibits singlet fission. We address a longstanding theoretical
issue, namely whether singlet fission proceeds via two sequential electron
transfer steps mediated by a charge-transfer state or via a direct two-electron
transfer process. We find evidence for a superexchange mediated mechanism,
whereby the fission process proceeds through virtual charge-transfer states
which may be very high in energy. In particular, this mechanism predicts
efficient singlet fission on the sub-picosecond timescale, in reasonable
agreement with experiment. We investigate the role played by molecular
vibrations in mediating relaxation and decoherence, finding that different
physically reasonable forms for the bath relaxation function give similar
results. We also examine the competing direct coupling mechanism and find it to
yield fission rates slower in comparison with the superexchange mechanism for
the dimer. We discuss implications for crystalline pentacene, including the
limitations of the dimer model.

support an insolation habitable zone (IHZ). Unlike hydrogen-burning stars, they
cool and become less luminous with time, and hence their IHZ moves in with
time. The inner edge of the IHZ is defined as the orbital radius at which a
planet may enter a moist or runaway greenhouse, phenomena that can remove a
planet's surface water forever. Thus, as the IHZ moves in, planets that enter
it may no longer have any water, and are still uninhabitable. Additionally, the
close proximity of the IHZ to the primary leads to concern that tidal heating
may also be strong enough to trigger a runaway greenhouse, even for orbital
eccentricities as small as 10^-6. Water loss occurs due to photolyzation by UV
photons in the planetary stratosphere, followed by hydrogen escape. Young white
dwarfs emit a large amount of these photons as their surface temperatures are
over 10^4 K. The situation is less clear for brown dwarfs, as observational
data do not constrain their early activity and UV emission very well.
Nonetheless, both types of planets are at risk of never achieving habitable
conditions, but planets orbiting white dwarfs may be less likely to sustain
life than those orbiting brown dwarfs. We consider the future habitability of
the planet candidates KOI 55.01 and 55.02 in these terms and find they are
unlikely to become habitable.

  The Hungarian theories are very extensive, and their associated proofs are

has, we can identify where this has happened); (b) we can identify which axioms
are specifically required in the proof of each theorem and to what extent those

form of the measure is applied to the explicit characterization of bipartite
entanglement for $n$-qubit systems in the Werner state, Dicke state, GHZ state

is found and it is shown that deviations from the symmetricity of such states
diminishes the amount of entanglement. For Dicke states the maximal value of
bipartite entanglement is achieved when number of excitations is half of the
total number of qubits in these states. For trigonometric states the bipartite
entanglement is maximal and does not depend on the number of qubits. We also

spatial variations of the opacity due to ""big"" grains over a variety of
environmental conditions and thereby quantify how emission properties of the
dust change with column (and volume) density. The central and southern areas of
the Orion A molecular cloud examined here, with NH ranging from 1.5X10^21 cm^-2
to 50X10^21 cm^-2, are well suited to this approach. We fit the multi-frequency
Herschel spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each pixel with a modified
blackbody to obtain the temperature, T, and optical depth, \tau(1200), at a
fiducial frequency of 1200 GHz (250 um). Using a calibration of NH/E(J-Ks)for
the interstellar medium (ISM) we obtained the opacity (dust emission
cross-section per H nucleon), \sigma_e(1200), for every pixel. From a value of
~ 1X10^-25 cm^2 H^-1 at the lowest column densities that is typical of the high
latitude diffuse ISM, \sigma_e(1200) increases as NH^0.28 over the range
studied. This is suggestive of grain evolution. Integrating the SEDs over
frequency, we also calculated the specific power P (emission power per H) for
the big grains. In low column density regions where dust clouds are optically
thin to the interstellar radiation field (ISRF), P is typically 3.7 X 10^-31 W
H^-1, again close to that in the high latitude diffuse ISM. However, we find
evidence for a decrease of P in high column density regions, which would be a
natural outcome of attenuation of the ISRF that heats the grains, and for
localized increases for dust illuminated by nearby stars or embedded
protostars.

the time a particle spends within a finite region of a potential and the time a

photoionization of an electron by an extreme ultraviolet (XUV) laser field
using numerical simulations on a grid. Our numerical results are in good
agreement with those of the Wigner-Smith time delay, obtained as the derivative
of the phase shift of the scattering wave packet with respect to its energy,
for the short-range Yukawa potential. In case of the Coulomb potential we
obtain time delays for any finite region, while - as expected - the results do
not converge as the size of the region increases towards infinity. The impact
of an ultrashort near-infrared probe pulse on the time delay is analyzed for

should satisfy in order to lead to a successful inflation. In that paper, we
showed that elementary tools of algebra allow a group like procedure in which
even Hopf algebras (roughly the symmetries of non-commutative spaces) could
lead to the equation of state of inflationary radiation. In this paper, we show
that there exists a conceptual problem with the kind of representation that
leads to the fundamental equations of the model. The problem comes from an
incompatibility between one of the minimal conditions for successful inflation
(the momentum of individual photons is bounded from above) and the group
structure of the representation which leads to the fundamental inflationary
equations of state. We show that such a group structure, although
mathematically allowed, would lead to problems with the overall consistency of
physics, like in scattering theory, for example. Therefore, it follows that the
procedure to obtain those equations should be modified according to one of two
possible proposals that we consider here. One of them relates to the general
theory of Hopf algebras while the other is based on a representation theorem of
Von Neumann algebras, a proposal already suggested by us to take into account
interactions in the inflationary equation of state. This reopens the problem of
finding inflationary deformed dispersion relations and all developments which

hoping to get a matching pair. Even in the simplest situation for sampling,
which is sampling with replacement, the innocent phrase ""the distribution of
the color of a matching pair"" is ambiguous. One interpretation is that we
condition on the event of getting a match between two random socks; this
corresponds to sampling two at a time, over and over without memory, until a
matching pair is found. A second interpretation is to sample sequentially, one
at a time, with memory, until the same color has been seen twice.
  We study the difference between these two methods. The input is a discrete
probability distribution on colors, describing what happens when one sock is
sampled. There are two derived distributions --- the pair-color distributions
under the two methods of getting a match. The output, a number we call the
discrepancy of the input distribution, is the total variation distance between
the two derived distributions.
  It is easy to determine when the two pair-color distributions come out equal,
that is, to determine which distributions have discrepancy zero, but hard to
determine the largest possible discrepancy. We find the exact extreme for the
case of two colors, by analyzing the roots of a fifth degree polynomial in one
variable. We find the exact extreme for the case of three colors, by analyzing
the 49 roots of a variety spanned by two seventh-degree polynomials in two
variables. We give a plausible conjecture for the general situation of a finite
number of colors, and give an exact computation of a constant which is a
plausible candidate for the supremum of the discrepancy over all discrete
probability distributions.
  We briefly consider the more difficult case where the objects to be matched
into pairs are of two different kinds, such as male-female or left-right.

emission regions to be within about 10 gravitational radii of the central
supermassive black hole. Therefore, the X-ray emission from lensed quasars is
first strongly lensed by the black hole before it is lensed by the foreground
galaxy and star fields. We present a scheme that combines the initial strong
lensing of a Kerr black hole with standard linearized microlensing by
intervening stars. We find that X-ray microlensed light curves incorporating
Kerr strong gravity can differ significantly from standard curves. The
amplitude of the fluctuations in the light curves can increase or decrease by
~0.65-0.75 mag by including Kerr strong gravity. Larger inclination angles give
larger amplitude fluctuations in the microlensing light curves. Consequently,
current X-ray microlensing observations might have under or overestimated the
sizes of the X-ray emission regions. We estimate this bias using a simple
metric based on the amplitude of magnitude fluctuations. The half light radius
of the X-ray emission region can be underestimated up to ~50% or overestimated
up to ~20%. Underestimates are found in most situations we have investigated.
The only exception is for a disk with large spin, radially flat emission
profile, and observed nearly face on, where an overestimate is found. Thus,
more accurate microlensing size constraints should be obtainable by including
Kerr lensing. The caustic crossing time can differ by months after including
Kerr strong gravity. A simultaneous monitoring of gravitational lensed quasars
in both X-ray and optical bands with densely sampled X-ray light curves might
reveal this feature. We conclude that it should be possible to constrain
important parameters such as inclination angles and black hole spins from
combined Kerr and microlensing effects.

stars. Barnes et al. (2011) presented the source catalog of ~300 clumps based
on HCO+(1-0) emission, used to estimate masses M. Here we use archival
mid-infrared to mm continuum data to construct spectral energy distributions.
Fitting two-temperature grey-body models, we derive bolometric luminosities, L.
We find the clumps have 10Lsun<L<1E6.5Lsun and 0.1<L/M<1E3, consistent with
theoretical expectations of a clump population that spans a range of
instantaneous star formation efficiencies from 0 to ~50%. We thus expect L/M to
be a useful, strongly-varying indicator of clump evolution during the star
cluster formation process. We find correlations of the ratio of warm to cold
component fluxes and of cold component temperature with L/M. We also find a
near linear relation between L/M and Spitzer-IRAC specific intensity (surface
brightness), which may thus also be useful as a star formation efficiency
indicator. The lower bound of the clump $L/M$ distribution suggests the star
formation efficiency per free-fall time is epsilon<0.2. We do not find strong
correlations of L/M with mass surface density, velocity dispersion or virial
parameter. We find a linear relation between L and L_{HCO+(1-0}}, although with
large scatter for any given individual clump. Fitting together with
extragalactic systems, the linear relation still holds, extending over 10
orders of magnitude in luminosity. The complete nature of the CHaMP survey over
a several kiloparsec-scale region allows us to derive a measurement at an

from an underlying stochastic process, the continuous time random walk (CTRW).
The non-trivial incorporation of the reaction process into the CTRW is achieved
by splitting the derivation into two stages. The reactions are treated as
birth-death processes and the first stage of the derivation is at the single
particle level, taking into account the death process, whilst the second stage
considers an ensemble of these particles including the birth process. Using
this model we have investigated different types of pattern formation across the
vertices on a range of networks. Importantly, the CTRW defines the Laplacian
operator on the network in a non \emph{ad-hoc} manner and the pattern formation
depends on the structure of this Laplacian. Here we focus attention on CTRWs
with exponential waiting times for two cases; one in which the rate parameter
is constant for all vertices and the other where the rate parameter is
proportional to the vertex degree. This results in nonsymmetric and symmetric
CTRW Laplacians respectively. In the case of symmetric Laplacians, pattern
formation follows from the Turing instability. However in nonsymmetric
Laplacians, pattern formation may be possible with or without a Turing
instability.

  application for flows in random porous media","32 pages, 14 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic modeling has become a popular approach to quantify uncertainty in
flows through heterogeneous porous media. The uncertainty in heterogeneous
structure properties is often parameterized by a high-dimensional random
variable. This leads to a deterministic problem in a high-dimensional parameter
space and the numerical computation becomes very challengeable as the dimension
of the parameter space increases. To efficiently tackle the
high-dimensionality, we propose a hybrid high dimensional model representation
(HDMR) technique, through which the high-dimensional stochastic model is
decomposed into a moderate-dimensional stochastic model in a most active random
space and a few one-dimensional stochastic models. The derived low-dimensional
stochastic models are solved by incorporating sparse grid stochastic
collocation method into the proposed hybrid HDMR. The porous media properties
such as permeability are often heterogeneous. To treat the heterogeneity, we
use a mixed multiscale finite element method (MMsFEM) to simulate each of
derived stochastic models. To capture the non-local spatial features of the
porous media and the important effects of random variables, we can
hierarchically incorporate the global information individually from each of
random parameters. This significantly enhances the accuracy of the multiscale
simulation. The synergy of the hybrid HDMR and the MMsFEM reduces the
stochastic model of flows in both stochastic space and physical space, and
significantly decreases the computation complexity. We carefully analyze the
proposed HDMR technique and the derived stochastic MMsFEM. A few numerical
experiments are carried out for two-phase flows in random porous media and
support the efficiency and accuracy of the MMsFEM based on the hybrid HDMR.

important phenomena. However, privacy considerations and the sheer scale of
data available online are quickly making global monitoring infeasible, and
existing methods do not take full advantage of local network structure to
identify key nodes for monitoring. Here, we develop a model of the contagious
spread of information in a global-scale, publicly-articulated social network
and show that a simple method can yield not just early detection, but advance
warning of contagious outbreaks. In this method, we randomly choose a small
fraction of nodes in the network and then we randomly choose a ""friend"" of each
node to include in a group for local monitoring. Using six months of data from
most of the full Twittersphere, we show that this friend group is more central
in the network and it helps us to detect viral outbreaks of the use of novel
hashtags about 7 days earlier than we could with an equal-sized randomly chosen
group. Moreover, the method actually works better than expected due to network
structure alone because highly central actors are both more active and exhibit
increased diversity in the information they transmit to others. These results
suggest that local monitoring is not just more efficient, it is more effective,
and it is possible that other contagious processes in global-scale networks may
be similarly monitored.

high-temperature intracluster medium of about 10^7 K, believed to offer a main
foreground effect for cosmic microwave background (CMB) data in the form of the
thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. This assumption has been confirmed by
SZ signal detection in hundreds of clusters but, in comparison with the huge
numbers of clusters within optically selected samples from Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) data, this only accounts for a few per cent of clusters. Here we
introduce a model-independent new method to confirm the assumption that most
galaxy clusters can offer the thermal SZ signal as their main foreground
effect. For the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) seven-year data
(and a given galaxy cluster sample), we introduced a parameter d1 as the
nearest-neighbour cluster angular distance of each pixel, then we classified
data pixels as 'to be' (d1--> 0 case) or 'not to be' (d1 large enough) affected
by the sample clusters. By comparing the statistical results of these two kinds
of pixels, we can see how the sample clusters affect the CMB data directly. We
find that the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (ESZ) sample and X-ray samples
(~10^2 clusters) can lead to obvious temperature depression in the WMAP
seven-year data, which confirms the SZ effect prediction. However, each
optically selected sample (>10^4 clusters) shows an opposite result: the mean
temperature rises to about 10uK. This unexpected qualitative scenario implies
that the main foreground effect of most clusters is $not$ always the expected
SZ effect. This may be the reason why the SZ signal detection result is lower
than expected from the model.

original vision of a staggered magnetic field within a crystal lattice has been
prohibitively difficult to realise. In fact, in the original paper Haldane
stresses his idea is probably merely a toy model. I show that buckled lattices
with only simple hopping terms, within in-plane magnetic fields, can realise
these models, requiring no exotic interactions or experimental parameters. As a
concrete example of this very broad, and remarkably simple principle, I
consider silicene, a honeycomb lattice with out-of-plane sublattice anisotropy,

negligibly small magnetic fields, which is analogous to Haldane's original

performance of multi signal ensembles by exploiting both intra- and

Unfortunately, the GDCS may require much a priori-knowledge on various inter

search for the correlation structure among the signals, with which the proposed
GDCS improves detection performance even without a priori-knowledge on

an interaction induced by the exchange of a new light vector boson. We report a
new experimental upper bound on such possible long-range parity-odd

for parity violation in neutron spin rotation in liquid $^{4}He$. Our
constraint on the product of vector and axial vector couplings of a possible
new light vector boson is $g_{V}g_{A}^{n} \leq 10^{-32}$ for an interaction
range of 1m. This upper bound is more than seven orders of magnitude more
stringent than the existing laboratory constraints for interaction ranges below
1m, corresponding to a broad range of vector boson masses above $10^{-6}$ eV.
More sensitive searches for a $g_{V}g_{A}^{n}$ coupling could be performed

ejections (CMEs) consist of a multi-temperature structure: a hot flux rope and
a cool leading front (LF). The flux rope first appears as a twisted hot channel
in the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly 94 A and 131 A passbands. The twisted hot
channel initially lies along the polarity inversion line and then rises and
develops into the semi-circular flux rope-like structure during the impulsive
acceleration phase of CMEs. In the meantime, the rising hot channel compresses
the surrounding magnetic field and plasma, which successively stack into the
CME LF. In this paper, we study in detail two well-observed CMEs occurred on
2011 March 7 and 2011 March 8, respectively. Each of them is associated with an
M-class flare. Through a kinematic analysis we find that: (1) the hot channel
rises earlier than the first appearance of the CME LF and the onset of the
associated flare; (2) the speed of the hot channel is always faster than that
of the LF, at least in the field of view of AIA. Thus, the hot channel acts as
a continuous driver of the CME formation and eruption in the early acceleration
phase. Subsequently, the two CMEs in white-light images can be well reproduced
by the graduated cylindrical shell flux rope model. These results suggest that
the pre-existing flux rope plays a key role in CME initiation and formation.

simulations of the clusters with different initial rotations and compared the
results with those of the Fokker-Planck (FP) simulations. We confirmed that the
cluster evolution is accelerated by not only the initial rotation but also the
mass spectrum. For the slowly rotating models, the time evolutions of mass,
energy and angular momentum show good agreements between N-body and FP
simulations. On the other hand, for the rapidly rotating models, there are
significant differences between these two approaches at the early stage of the
evolutions because of the development of bar instability in N-body simulations.
The shape of the cluster for N-body simulations becomes tri-axial or even
prolate, which cannot be produced by the 2-dimensional FP simulations. The
total angular momentum and the total mass of the cluster decrease rapidly while
bar-like structure persists. After the rotational energy becomes smaller than
the critical value for the bar instability, the shape of the cluster becomes
nearly axisymmetric again, and follows the evolutionary track predicted by the
FP equation. We have confirmed again that the energy equipartiton is not
completely achieved when M2/M1(m2>/m1)^(3/2) > 0.16. By examining the angular
momentum at each mass component, we found that the exchange of angular momentum
between different mass components occurs, similar to the energy exchange
leading to the equipartition.

very strong Mg II absorption systems intervening the sightlines to gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) relative to the in- cidence of such absorption along quasar
sightlines. This counterintuitive result, has inspired a diverse set of
astrophysical explanations (e.g. dust, gravitational lensing) but none of these
has obviously resolved the puzzle. Using the largest set of GRB afterglow
spectra available, we reexamine the purported enhancement. In an independent
sample of GRB spectra with a survey path 3 times larger than Prochter et al.,
we measure the incidence per unit redshift of $\geq 1$\AA rest-frame equivalent
width Mg II absorbers at $z \approx 1$ to be l(z)= 0.18 $\pm$ 0.06. This is
fully consistent with current estimates for the incidence of such absorbers
along quasar sightlines. Therefore, we do not confirm the original enhancement
and suggest those results suffered from a statistical fluke. Signatures of the
original result do remain in our full sample (l(z) shows an $\approx 1.5$
enhancement over l(z)QSO), but the statistical significance now lies at
$\approx 90%$ c.l. Restricting our analysis to the subset of high-resolution
spectra of GRB afterglows (which overlaps substantially with Prochter et al.),
we still reproduce a statistically significant enhancement of Mg II absorption.
The reason for this excess, if real, is still unclear since there is no
connection between the rapid afterglow follow-up process with echelle (or
echellette) spectrographs and the detectability of strong Mg II doublets. Only
a larger sample of such high-resolution data will shed some light on this

ionized gas along the full extent of the galaxy disc. Narrow-band Halpha
imaging resolves this outflow into a complex of knots and filaments. The gas
velocity field is complex with the extraplanar gas showing signature of
rotation. In all parts of the galaxy, we find a significant contribution from
shock excitation, as well as emission powered by star formation. Shock-ionized
gas is associated with the turbulent gas outflow and highly attenuated by dust.
All these findings cover the whole phenomenology of early-stage ram-pressure
stripping. Intense, highly obscured star formation is taking place in the
nucleus, probably related to the bar, and in a region 12 kpc South-West from
the centre. In the SW region we identify a starburst characterized by a 5x
increase in the star-formation rate over the last ~100 Myr, possibly related to
the compression of the interstellar gas by the ram pressure. The scenario
suggested by the observations is supported and refined by ad hoc
N-body/hydrodynamical simulations which identify a rather narrow temporal range
for the onset of ram-pressure stripping around t~60 Myr ago, and an angle
between the galaxy rotation axis and the intra-cluster medium wind of ~45 deg.
Taking into account that the galaxy is found ~1 Mpc from the cluster centre in
a relatively low-density region, this study shows that ram-pressure stripping
still acts efficiently on massive galaxies well outside the cluster cores.

transition from hadronic to partonic degrees of freedom and possibly a critical
endpoint, is one of the most challenging tasks in present heavy-ion physics. As
observed by the NA49 experiment, several hadronic observables in central Pb+Pb
collisions at the CERN SPS show qualitative changes in their energy dependence.
These features are not observed in elementary interactions and indicate the
onset of a phase transition in the SPS energy range. The existence of a
critical point is expected to result in the increase of event-by-event
fluctuations of various hadronic observables provided that the freeze-out of
the measured hadrons occurs close to its location in the phase diagram and the
evolution of the final hadron phase does not erase the fluctuations signals. A
selection of NA49 results on di-pion and proton intermittency from the scan of
the phase diagram will be discussed.

an expansion of the six-point amplitudes around a special kinematic point.

Transit detection algorithms are mathematical tools used for

exploring the parameter space of the transit surveys where classical algorithms
do not perform optimally, either because of the challenging signal-to-noise
ratio of the signal or its non-periodic characteristics. We have developed an
algorithm addressing these challenges for the mission CoRoT. Here we extend the
application to the data from the space mission Kepler. We aim at understanding
the performances of algorithms in different data sets. Methods: We built a
simple analytical model of the transit signal and developed a strategy for the
search that improves the detection performance for transiting planets. We
analyzed Kepler data with a set of stellar activity filtering and transit
detection tools from the CoRoT community that are designed for the search of
transiting planets. Results: We present a new algorithm and its performances

CoRoT data. Additionally, we analyzed Kepler data corresponding to quarter Q1

distribution, are expected to differ from the interstellar medium to the

extinction law produced by dense material in molecular cloud cores. Since the
extinction at these wavelengths is caused by dust, the extinction law in cores
should depart from that found in low-density environments if the dust grains
have different properties. Methods. We use the unbiased LINES method to measure
the slope of the reddening vectors in color-color diagrams. We derive the
mid-infrared extinction law toward the dense cores B59 and FeSt 1-457 in the
Pipe Nebula over a range of visual extinction between 10 and 50 magnitudes,
using a combination of Spitzer/IRAC, and ESO NTT/VLT data. Results. The
mid-infrared extinction law in both cores departs significantly from a
power-law between 3.6 and 8 micron, suggesting that these cores contain dust
with a considerable fraction of large dust grains. We find no evidence for a
dependence of the extinction law with column density up to 50 magnitudes of
visual extinction in these cores, and no evidence for a variation between our
result and those for other clouds at lower column densities reported elsewhere
in the literature. This suggests that either large grains are present even in
low column density regions, or that the existing dust models need to be revised
at mid-infrared wavelengths. We find a small but significant difference in the
extinction law of the two cores, that we tentatively associate with the onset
of star formation in B59.

coordination sphere of 8-dimensional lattice E8. The second polytope of
sequence allows to determine a topologically stable rod substructure that
appears during multiplication by a non-crystallographic axis 40/11 of the

  Processes on the Line","18 pages",,,,"math-ph cond-mat.stat-mech math.MP nlin.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Calogero-Moser systems are a series of interacting particle systems on
one dimension that are both classically and quantum-mechanically integrable.
Their integrability has been established through the use of Dunkl operators (a
series of differential-difference operators that depend on the choice of an
abstract set of vectors, or root system). At the same time, Dunkl operators are
used to define a family of stochastic processes called Dunkl processes. We
showed in a previous paper that when the coupling constant of interaction of
the symmetric Dunkl process on the root system A(N-1) goes to infinity (the
freezing regime), its final configuration is proportional to the roots of the
Hermite polynomials. It is also known that the positions of the particles of
the Calogero-Moser system with particle exchange become fixed at the roots of
the Hermite polynomials in the freezing regime. Although both systems present a
freezing behaviour that depends on the roots of the Hermite polynomials, the
reason for this similarity has been an open problem until now. In the present
work, we introduce a new type of similarity transformation called the
diffusion-scaling transformation, in which a new space variable is given by a
diffusion-scaling variable constructed using the original space and time
variables. We prove that the abstract Calogero-Moser system on an arbitrary
root system is a diffusion-scaling transform of the Dunkl process on the same
root system. With this, we prove that the similar freezing behaviour of the two
systems on A(N-1) stems from their similar mathematical structure.

neighbouring active-region (NOAA 11303), and their EUV waves, with the
dynamical developments of the tornado. The timings of the flares and EUV waves
observed on-disk in 195\AA\ are analyzed in relation to the tornado activities
observed at the limb in 171\AA. Each of the three flares and its related EUV
wave occurred within 10 hours of the onset of the tornado. They have an
observed causal relationship with the commencement of activity in the
prominence where the tornado develops. Tornado-like rotations along the side of
the prominence start after the second flare. The prominence cavity expands with
acceleration of tornado motion after the third flare. Flares in the
neighbouring active region may have affected the cavity prominence system and
triggered the solar tornado. A plausible mechanism is that the active-region
coronal field contracted by the `Hudson effect' due to the loss of magnetic
energy as flares. Subsequently the cavity expanded by its magnetic pressure to
fill the surrounding low corona. We suggest that the tornado is the dynamical
response of the helical prominence field to the cavity expansion.

overlapping information in the diffraction pattern. Techniques have been
generally available since the 1980s which overcome this restriction for

and beam convergence. Here, we describe a simple technique which overcomes all

a large angular range for many diffracted beams from the volume given by a
focused electron beam (typically a few nm or less). The increase in the amount

prediction of multiple target variables from a common set of input variables.
When the prediction targets are binary the task is called multi-label
classification, while when the targets are continuous the task is called
multi-target regression. In both tasks, target variables often exhibit
statistical dependencies and exploiting them in order to improve predictive
accuracy is a core challenge. A family of multi-label classification methods
address this challenge by building a separate model for each target on an
expanded input space where other targets are treated as additional input
variables. Despite the success of these methods in the multi-label
classification domain, their applicability and effectiveness in multi-target
regression has not been studied until now. In this paper, we introduce two new
methods for multi-target regression, called Stacked Single-Target and Ensemble
of Regressor Chains, by adapting two popular multi-label classification methods
of this family. Furthermore, we highlight an inherent problem of these methods
- a discrepancy of the values of the additional input variables between
training and prediction - and develop extensions that use out-of-sample
estimates of the target variables during training in order to tackle this
problem. The results of an extensive experimental evaluation carried out on a
large and diverse collection of datasets show that, when the discrepancy is
appropriately mitigated, the proposed methods attain consistent improvements
over the independent regressions baseline. Moreover, two versions of Ensemble
of Regression Chains perform significantly better than four state-of-the-art
methods including regularization-based multi-task learning methods and a

self-organize into large scale structures such as zonal jets and coherent
vortices. In this Letter we present a non-equilibrium statistical theory, the
Stochastic Structural Stability theory (SSST), that can make predictions for
the formation and finite amplitude equilibration of non-zonal and zonal
structures (lattice and stripe patterns) in homogeneous turbulence. This theory
reveals that the emergence of large scale structure is the result of an
instability of the interaction between the coherent flow and the associated
turbulent field. Comparison of the theory with nonlinear simulations of a
barotropic flow in a beta-plane channel with turbulence sustained by isotropic
random stirring, demonstrates that SSST predicts the threshold parameters at
which the coherent structures emerge as well as the characteristics of the
emerging structures (scale, amplitude, phase speed). It is shown that non-zonal
structures (lattice states or zonons) emerge at lower energy input rates of the
stirring compared to zonal flows (stripe states) and their emergence affects
the dynamics of jet formation.

detections occur faster than the detector's registration and recovery time. At
high input rates, shaped pulses interfere and the source spectrum, as well as
intensity information, get distorted. For instruments using bipolar pulse
shaping there are two aspects to consider: `peak' and `tail' pileup effects,
which raise and lower the measured energy, respectively. Peak effects have been
extensively modeled in the past. Tail effects have garnered less attention due
to the increased complexity: bipolar tails mean the tail pulse-height
measurement depends on events in more than one time interval. We leverage
previous work to derive an accurate, semi-analytical prediction for peak and
tail pileup, up to high orders. We use the true pulse shape from the detectors
of the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. The measured spectrum is calculated by
writing exposure time as a state-space expansion of overlapping pileup states
and is valid up to very high rates. This expansion models losses due to fixed
and extendable deadtime by averaging overlap configurations. Additionally, the
model correctly predicts energy-dependent losses due to tail subtraction
(sub-threshold) effects. We discuss pileup losses in terms of the true rate of
photon detections versus the recorded count rate.

phases Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10+x (Bi-2223)/Bi-2212 have been subjected to annealing
treatments at 90{\deg}C in air in a few hours steps, up to a maximum total
annealing time of 47 h. At every step, samples have been characterized by means
of electrical resistance vs temperature (R vs T) and resistance vs time at
fixed temperature (R vs t) measurements, both in the dark and under
illumination with a UV-VIS halogen arc lamp. A careful comparison of the
results from the two techniques has shown that, while for single-phase samples
no effect is recorded, for mixed-phase samples an enhancement in the
conductivity that increases with increasing the annealing time is induced by
the light at the nominal temperature T = 100 K, i.e. at an intermediate
temperature between the critical temperatures of the two phases. A simple
pseudo-1D model based on the Kudinov's scheme [Kudinov et al., Phys. Rev. B 47,
9017-28, (1993)] has been developed to account for the observed effects, which
is based on the existence of Bi-2223 filaments embedded in the Bi-2212 matrix
and on the presence of electronically active defects at their interfaces. This
model reproduces fairly well the photoconductive experimental results and shows
that the length of the Bi-2223 filaments decreases and the number of defects
increases with increasing the annealing time.

in this work. For bandlimited signals, the distortion due to additive
independent Gaussian noise can be reduced by oversampling (statistical
diversity). The pointwise expected mean-squared error is used as a distortion
metric for signal estimate in this work. Two extreme scenarios of quantizer
precision are considered: (i) infinite precision (real scalars); and (ii)
one-bit quantization (sign information). If $N$ is the oversampling ratio with
respect to the Nyquist rate, then the optimal law for distortion is $O(1/N)$.
We show that a distortion of $O(1/N)$ can be achieved irrespective of the
quantizer precision by considering the above-mentioned two extreme scenarios of
quantization. Thus, a quantization precision indifference principle is
discovered, where the reconstruction distortion law, up to a proportionality
constant, is unaffected by quantizer's accuracy.

both components of the binary protostar. Toward one of the components, ""source
B"", the line is seen in absorption toward the continuum, slightly red-shifted
from the systemic velocity, whereas emission is seen off-source at the systemic
velocity. Toward the other component, ""source A"", the two HDO and H2-18O lines
are detected as well with the SMA. From the H2-18O transitions the excitation
temperature is estimated at 124 +/- 12 K. The calculated HDO/H2O ratio is (9.2
+/- 2.6)*10^(-4) - significantly lower than previous estimates in the warm gas
close to the source. It is also lower by a factor of ~5 than the ratio deduced

genera require increased host cell cytosolic calcium for intracellular
invasion. Among intracellular bacteria, the mechanism of host cell invasion of
genus Salmonella is the most similar to T. cruzi. The invasion of Salmonella
occurs by contact with the host's cell surface and is mediated by the type III
secretion system (T3SS) that promotes the contact-dependent translocation of
effector proteins directly into host's cell cytoplasm. Here we provide evidence
of distant sequence similarities and structurally conserved domains between T.

time-independent initial condition equation, not concerned with the HBM. The
continuation of the resulting algebraic system is here performed by the
asymptotic numerical method (high order Taylor series representation of the
solution branch) using a further differentiation of the non-polynomial
algebraic equation with respect to the path parameter. A one dof vibro-impact
system is used to illustrate how an exponential nonlinearity is handled,
showing that the method works at very high order, 1000 in that case. Various
kinds of nonlinear functions are also treated, and finally the nonlinear free
pendulum is addressed, showing that very accurate periodic solutions can be
computed with the proposed method.

graphene-based two-dimensional Dirac fermion gases in the quantum Hall regime.
Taking monolayer graphene as our first candidate, we show that a quantum phase
transition between two distinct topological states -- the quantum Hall and the
quantum spin Hall phases -- can be driven by simply tuning the Fermi level with
a gate voltage. This transition is characterized by the existence of a chiral
spin-polarized edge state propagating along the interface separating the two
topological phases. We then apply our analysis to the more difficult case of
bilayer graphene. Unlike in monolayer graphene, spin-orbit coupling by itself
has indeed been predicted to be unsuccessful in driving bilayer graphene into a
topological phase, due to the existence of an even number of pairs of
spin-polarized edge states. While we show that this remains the case in the
quantum Hall regime, we point out that by additionally breaking the layer
inversion symmetry, a non-trivial quantum spin Hall phase can re-emerge in
bilayer graphene at low energy. We consider two different symmetry-breaking
mechanisms: inducing spin-orbit coupling only in the upper layer, and applying
a perpendicular electric field. In both cases, the presence at low energy of an
odd number of pairs of edge states can be driven by an exchange field. The
related situation in trilayer graphene is also discussed.

Development of numerical relativity codes in spherical polar coordinates has
been hampered by the need to handle the coordinate singularities at the origin
and on the axis, for example by careful regularization of the appropriate
variables. Assuming spherical symmetry and adopting a covariant version of the
BSSN equations, Montero and Cordero-Carri\'on recently demonstrated that such a
regularization is not necessary when a partially implicit Runge-Kutta (PIRK)
method is used for the time evolution of the gravitational fields. Here we
report on an implementation of the BSSN equations in spherical polar
coordinates without any symmetry assumptions. Using a PIRK method we obtain
stable simulations in three spatial dimensions without the need to regularize
the origin or the axis. We perform and discuss a number of tests to assess the
stability, accuracy and convergence of the code, namely weak gravitational
waves, ""hydro-without-hydro"" evolutions of spherical and rotating relativistic
stars in equilibrium, and single black holes.

balance ratio is firstly proposed to measure the balance property of edges in

are put forward to describe the balance level of the whole network. Then the
distribution of edge balance ratio is theoretically analyzed. In a directed
network whose vertex in-degree follows the power law with scaling exponent
$\gamma$, it is proved that the edge balance ratio follows a piecewise power
law, with the scaling exponent of each section linearly dependents on $\gamma$.
The theoretical analysis is verified by numerical simulations. Moreover, the
theoretical analysis is confirmed by statistics of real-world online social
networks, including Twitter network with 35 million users and Sina Weibo

using experiments, potential flow numerical simulations and theory. We focus
our attention both on the study of the generation and possible breakup of the
splash wave created after the impact and on the calculation of the force on the
disc. We have experimentally found that drops are only ejected from the rim
located at the top part of the splash --giving rise to what is known as the
crown splash-- if the impact Weber number exceeds a threshold value
$\Weber_{crit}\simeq 140$. We explain this threshold by defining a local Bond
number $Bo_{tip}$ based on the rim deceleration and its radius of curvature,
with which we show using both numerical simulations and experiments that a
crown splash only occurs when $Bo_{tip}\gtrsim 1$, revealing that the rim
disrupts due to a Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Neglecting the effect of air, we
show that the flow in the region close to the disc edge possesses a
Weber-number-dependent self-similar structure for every Weber number. From this
we demonstrate that $\Bond_{tip}\propto\Weber$, explaining both why the
transition to crown splash can be characterized in terms of the impact Weber
number and why this transition occurs for $We_{crit}\simeq 140$.
  Next, including the effect of air, we have developed a theory which predicts
the time-varying thickness of the very thin air cushion that is entrapped
between the impacting solid and the liquid. Our analysis reveals that gas
critically affect the velocity of propagation of the splash wave as well as the
time-varying force on the disc, $F_D$. The existence of the air layer also
limits the range of times in which the self-similar solution is valid and,
accordingly, the maximum deceleration experienced by the liquid rim, what sets
the length scale of the splash drops ejected when $We>\Weber_{crit}$.

to share many qualitative behaviours of the three dimensional problem. They can
resolve a large range of time and length scales, and admit exact numerical
integration. We use such models to study how non-linear clustering depends on
initial conditions and cosmology. More specifically, we consider a family of
models which, like the 3D EdS model, lead for power-law initial conditions to
self-similar clustering characterized in the strongly non-linear regime by
power-law behaviour of the two point correlation function. We study how the
corresponding exponent \gamma depends on the initial conditions, characterized
by the exponent n of the power spectrum of initial fluctuations, and on a
single parameter \kappa controlling the rate of expansion. The space of initial
conditions/cosmology divides very clearly into two parts: (1) a region in which
\gamma depends strongly on both n and \kappa and where it agrees very well with
a simple generalisation of the so-called stable clustering hypothesis in three
dimensions, and (2) a region in which \gamma is more or less independent of
both the spectrum and the expansion of the universe. We explain the observed
location of the boundary in (n, \kappa) space dividing the ""stable clustering""
region from the ""universal"" region. We compare and contrast our findings to
results in three dimensions, and discuss in particular the light they may throw
