They proposed a new algorithm called permutation combination algorithm. By
exploiting this algorithm, they attempt to increase the density of knapsack to
avoid the low-density attack.
  We show that this cryptosystem is not secure, as it based on basic
Merkel-Hellman knapsack cryptosystem and because of the superincreasing

break this cryptosystem.

a two-dimensional three-species population model and study the spiralling

mutation, pair-exchange and hopping of the individuals. The dynamics is
characterised by nonlinear mobility and a Hopf bifurcation around which the
system's phase diagram is inferred from the underlying complex Ginzburg-Landau
equation derived using a perturbative multiscale expansion. While the dynamics
is generally characterised by spiralling patterns, we show that spiral waves
are stable in only one of the four phases. Furthermore, we characterise a phase
where nonlinearity leads to the annihilation of spirals and to the spatially
uniform dominance of each species in turn. Away from the Hopf bifurcation, when
the coexistence fixed point is unstable, the spiralling patterns are also
affected by nonlinear diffusion.

focuses on the design and construction of a Dual Sensor heat-monitoring system.
The circuit works by monitoring temperature from an external input and
comparing the temperature level with that of a preset temperature value. The
power output of the circuit is cut off or switched OFF or an alarm is triggered
ON if the temperature of the external input is equal to or, greater than the
preset temperature value. The methodology involves the application of linear
precision temperature sensors i.e., they generate a voltage that is directly
proportional to the temperature. Basically the system is constructed using
temperature sensors and comparators. The system is powered using a 12V power
supply. The results of the tests showed that the power output of the circuit is
switched OFF hence switching OFF the heating device or an alarm is triggered ON
when the device exceeded a preset temperature level. The general operation of
the system and performance is dependent on the temperature difference between
the preset temperature value and external temperature intended to be monitored.
The overall system was tested and found perfectly functional.

little improvement in compression can be gained from intersensor communication
when the information is coded in long blocks. However, when sensors are

collaboration between sensors can greatly reduce distortion. For networks where
sensors are allowed to ""chat"" using a side channel that is unobservable at the
fusion center, we provide asymptotically-exact characterization of distortion
performance and optimal quantizer design in the high-resolution
(low-distortion) regime using a framework called distributed functional scalar
quantization (DFSQ). The key result is that chatting can dramatically improve
performance even when intersensor communication is at very low rate, especially
if the fusion center desires fidelity of a nonlinear computation applied to
source realizations rather than fidelity in representing the sources
themselves. We also solve the rate allocation problem when communication links
have heterogeneous costs and provide a detailed example to demonstrate the
theoretical and practical gains from chatting. This example for maximum

on the effect of local, non-affine bending deformations on mechanics. Here, we
study the impact of local network deformations on the scale-dependent mobility

high-bandwidth microrheology. We find that micron-sized particles in these

depletion reduces the effective network rigidity, while local non-affine

embedded in a viscoelastic background leads to a scaling regime for the
apparent elastic modulus G'(\omega) \sim \omega^{9/16}, closely matching the
experiments. These results provide quantitative evidence for how different a

emerge, clarifying their origin and relationship in random, feedforward
networks of McCullochs-Pitts neurons. Two key parameters are the thresholds at
which neurons fire spikes, and the overall level of feedforward connectivity.
When neurons have low thresholds, we show that there is always a connectivity
for which the properties in question all occur: that is, these networks
preserve overall firing rates from layer to layer and produce broad
distributions of activity in each layer. This fails to occur, however, when
neurons have high thresholds. A key tool in explaining this difference is
eigenstructure of the resulting mean-field Markov chain, as this reveals which
activity modes will be preserved from layer to layer. We extend our analysis
from purely excitatory networks to more complex models that include inhibition
and 'local' noise, and find that both of these features extend the parameter
ranges over which networks produce the properties of interest.

extent and cause of this large-scale environmental influence, we use a suite of
high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to analyse galaxies
around simulated groups and clusters of a wide range of mass (log M/M_sun =
[13.0, 15.2]). In qualitative agreement with the observations, we find a
systematic depletion of both hot and cold gas and a decline in the star forming
fraction of galaxies as far out as ~ 5 r200 from the host centre. While a
substantial fraction of these galaxies are on highly elliptical orbits and are
not infalling for the first time (~ 50 per cent at 2 r200, independent of host
mass) or are affected by `pre-processing' (less than 10 per cent of galaxies
around groups, increasing to ~ 50 per cent around a massive cluster), even a
combination of these indirect mechanisms does not fully account for the
environmental influence, particularly in the case of the hot gas content.
Direct ram pressure interaction with an extended gas `halo' surrounding groups
and clusters is shown to be sufficiently strong to strip the hot gas
atmospheres of infalling galaxies out to ~ 5 r200. We show that this influence
is highly anisotropic, with ram pressure along filaments enhanced by up to a
factor of 100 despite significant co-flow of gas and galaxies.

takes place in Hg1201, evidence that density-wave order exists in this

to that of the scalar cortical magnification factor M. Unlike M, this matrix is
suitable to describe anisotropy in cortical magnification, which is of
particular interest in the highly gyrified human cerebral cortex. The advantage
of our tensor method over other surface-based 3D methods to explore cortical
morphometry is that M expresses cortical quantities in the corresponding
sensory space. It allows us to investigate the spatial relation between sensory
function and anatomical structure. To this end, we consider the calcarine
sulcus (CS) as an anatomical landmark for the primary visual cortex (V1). We
found that a stereotypically formed 3D model of V1 compared to a flat model
explains an excess of cortical tissue for the representation of visual
information coming from the horizon of the visual field. This suggests that the
intrinsic geometry of this sulcus is adapted to encephalize a particular
function along the horizon. Since visual functions are assumed to be M-scaled,
cortical folding can serve as an anatomical basis for increased functionality
on the horizon similar to a retinal specialization known as visual streak,
which is found in animals with lower encephalization. Thus, the gain of surface
area by cortical folding links anatomical structure to cortical function in a
previously unrecognized way, which may guide sulci development.

qualitatively different evolutionary dynamics that is able to support the
stable existence of very small cooperative clusters. This leads to phase
diagrams that differ significantly from those obtained by means of pairwise
strategy updating. In particular, the survivability of cooperators is possible

encoded by many loci with small, additive effects. Recent advances in QTL
mapping have begun to elucidate the genetic architectures underlying vast
numbers of phenotypes across diverse taxa, producing observations that
sometimes contrast with Fisher's blueprint. Despite these considerable
empirical efforts to map the genetic determinants of traits, it remains poorly
understood how the genetic architecture of a trait should evolve, or how it
depends on the selection pressures on the trait. Here we develop a simple,
population-genetic model for the evolution of genetic architectures. Our model
predicts that traits under moderate selection should be encoded by many loci
with highly variable effects, whereas traits under either weak or strong
selection should be encoded by relatively few loci. We compare these
theoretical predictions to qualitative trends in the genetics of human traits,
and to systematic data on the genetics of gene expression levels in yeast. Our
analysis provides an evolutionary explanation for broad empirical patterns in
the genetic basis of traits, and it introduces a single framework that unifies
the diversity of observed genetic architectures, ranging from Mendelian to
Fisherian.

The light and radial velocity curves follow a similar, stable double-wave

about 0.1 period between the moment of minimum velocity and that of maximum
light. We considered three different scenarios: binarity, co-existence of both
Gamma Doradus and Delta Scuti pulsations and rotation of the stellar surface
with an axisymmetric intensity distribution. However, none of these scenarios
is capable of explaining all of the characteristics of the observed variations.

linear superposition of mass eigenstates one ignores the associated spin. If,
however, there is a significant rotation between the neutrino source, and the
detector, a negative helicity state emitted by the former acquires a non-zero
probability amplitude to be perceived as a positive helicity state by the
latter. Both of these states are still in the left-Weyl sector of the Lorentz
group. The electroweak interaction cross sections for such helicity-flipped
states are suppressed by a factor of $(m_\nu/E_\nu)^2$, where $m_\nu$ is the
expectation value of the neutrino mass, and $E_\nu$ is the associated energy.
Thus, if the detecting process is based on electroweak interactions, and the
neutrino source is a highly rotating object, the rotation-induced helicity flip
becomes very significant in interpreting the data. The effect immediately
generalizes to anti-neutrinos. Motivated by these observations we present a
generalization of the Pontecorvo formalism and discuss its relevance in the
context of recent data obtained by the IceCube neutrino telescope.

the extra $\log n$ factor on the additive term. This algorithm is furthermore
the first $O(n)$ time algorithm for this setting.
  Our algorithms improve over a 25 year old simulation approach of Bar-Yehuda,
Goldreich and Itai with a $O(T_{BC} \log n)$ running time: In 1987 they
designed a fast broadcast protocol and subsequently in 1989 they showed how it
can be used to simulate one round of a single-hop network that has collision
detection in $T_{BC}$ time. The prime application of this simulation was to
simulate Willards single-hop leader election protocol, which elects a leader in
$O(\log n)$ rounds with high probability and $O(\log \log n)$ rounds in
expectation. While it was subsequently shown that Willards bounds are tight, it
was unclear whether the simulation approach is optimal. Our results break this
barrier and essentially remove the logarithmic slowdown over the broadcast time
$T_{BC}$ by going away from the simulation approach.

subsonic and supersonic media, as well as other relevant regimes of
astrophysical turbulence. All this information is essential for understanding
the energetic particle acceleration that we discuss further in the review. For
instance, we show how fast and slow modes accelerate energetic particles
through the second order Fermi acceleration, while density fluctuations
generate magnetic fields in pre-shock regions enabling the first order Fermi
acceleration of high energy cosmic rays. Very importantly, however, the first
order Fermi cosmic ray acceleration is also possible in sites of magnetic
reconnection. In the presence of turbulence this reconnection gets fast and we
present numerical evidence supporting the predictions of the Lazarian &

suggests that magnetic reconnection can release substantial amounts of energy
in short periods of time. As the particle tracing numerical simulations show
that the particles can be efficiently accelerated during the reconnection, we
argue that the process of magnetic reconnection may be much more important for
particle acceleration than it is currently accepted. In particular, we discuss

The height of the Voyager 2 plumes on Triton can be explained by the dynamical
properties of the lower atmosphere alone (i.e., strong wind shear) and does not

and black hole growth are self-regulated in galaxies -- the ratio between black
hole accretion rate and star formation rate remains nearly constant in a wide
redshift span $z = 0-6$. These findings suggest that the observed correlations

we investigate the formation of a typical L* galaxy and its observational
signatures at the earliest stage, by combining a cosmological hydrodynamic
simulation with three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations using the
newly improved ART^2 code. Our cosmological simulation uses the Aquila initial
condition which zooms in onto a Milky Way-like halo with high resolutions, and
our radiative transfer couples multi-wavelength continuum, Lya line, and
ionization of hydrogen. We find that the modeled galaxy starts to form at
redshift z ~ 24 through efficient accretion of cold gas, which produces a
strong Lya line with a luminosity of L(Lya) ~ 10^42 erg/s as early as z ~ 14.
The Lya emission appears to trace the cold, dense gas. The lines exhibit
asymmetric, single-peak profiles, and are shifted to the blue wing, a
characteristic feature of gas inflow. Moreover, the contribution to the total
Lya luminosity by excitation cooling increases with redshift, and it becomes
dominant at z >~ 6. We predict that L* galaxies such as the modeled one may be
detected at z <~ 8 by JWST and ALMA with a reasonable integration time. Beyond
redshift 12, however, only Lya line may be observable by spectroscopic surveys.
Our results suggest that Lya line is one of the most powerful tools to detect
the first generation of galaxies, and to decipher their formation mechanism.

location of the snow line, and we propose that asteroid belts are most likely
to form in its vicinity. We then show that observations of warm dust in
exo-solar systems, thought to be produced by collisions between asteroids in a
belt, indicate that asteroid belts (when they exist), indeed coincide with the
radial location and the temperature of the snow line. Giant planets form
outside the snow line and prevent planet formation just inside of their orbit
creating an asteroid belt there. However, the migration of giant planets
through the asteroid belt likely disperses the compact formation. We examine
existing observations of giant exo-planets and find that less than 4% are at
radial locations outside of the snow line. This definitely may be the
consequence of observational selection effects. However, with this caveat in
mind, we point out that the dearth of giant planets outside the snow line may
also suggest that compact asteroid belts are not common, and more speculatively
that complex life may not expected in most of the currently observed systems.

from half-cell experiments, where the influences of the working electrode
porosity and the counter electrode contribute nonlinearly to the
electrochemical re-sponse. Therefore, thin-layer electrodes of circa 1 {\mu}m
thickness were prepared with standard, highly crystalline graphite particles to
evaluate their rate capability. The performance was evaluated based on the
different stage transitions. We found that the tran-sitions towards the dense
stages 1 and 2 with LiC6 in-plane densi-ty are one of the main rate limitations
for charge and discharge. But surprisingly, the transitions towards the dilute
stages 2L, 3L, 4L, and 1L progress very fast and can even compensate for the
initial diffusion limitations of the dense stage transitions during discharge.
We show the existence of a substantial difference between the diffusion
coefficients of the liquid-like stages and the dense stages. We also
demonstrate that graphite can be charged at a rate of ~6C (10 min) and
discharged at 600C (6 s) while maintaining 80 % of the total specific charge
for particles of 3.3 {\mu}m median diameter. Based on these findings, we
propose a shrinking annuli mechanism which describes the propagation of the
different stages in the particle at medium and high rates. Besides the limited
applicable overpotential during charge, this mechanism can explain the
long-known but as yet unexplained asymmetry between the charge and discharge
rate performance of lithium intercalation in graphite.

more evident if these subpopulations have widely different proportions of

make an attempt to overcome this problem. Our propose methods use suitable

horizon region of all the asymptotically flat solutions above, in the gauged
theory. This reveals a deep relation between microscopic entropy counting of
extremal black holes in Minkowski and BPS black holes in AdS. Finally, we
discuss the relevance of this construction to the structure of asymptotically
AdS4 black holes, as well as the possibility of including hypermultiplets.

Draine and Lazarian and recent theoretical results improving the Draine and
Lazarian model. The review is focused on important physical effects that were
disregarded in earlier studies for the sake of simplicity and recently
accounted for by us, including grain wobbling due to internal relaxation,
impulsive excitation by single-ion collisions, the triaxiality of grain shape,
charge fluctuations, and the turbulent nature of astrophysical environments.
Implications of the spinning dust emission for constraining physical properties
of tiny dust grains and environment conditions are discussed. We discuss the
alignment of tiny dust grains and possibility of polarized spinning dust
emission. Suggestions for constraining the alignment of tiny grains and
polarization of spinning dust emission are also discussed.

Our results for the condensate and conductivity are qualitatively similar to
those of the AdS superconductor. However, we find that (for both s- and p-wave)
the condensate does not approach a constant at very low temperature and the
conductivity goes to one from below but never exceeds it in the high frequency

frequency in the imaginary part of the AC conductivity along the $x$ direction
for the p-wave case. These features are due to the nontrivial dynamical
exponent. To be specific, the black hole geometry considered in this work is
anisotropic between space and time, very different from the Schwarzschild-AdS
black hole, which results in different asymptotic behaviors of temporal and
spatial components of gauge fields than those in the Schwarzschild-AdS black

studying natural extensions to General Relativity that we can more deeply
understand the theory of Einstein. Firstly, we will display the theory of
General Relativity with its building blocks in particular and we will give the
mathematical tools that we need afterwards. Then, a first extension will be
detailed with the introduction of higher dimensions and p-form fields which
constitute the natural generalization of the electromagnetic interaction. We
will build in this framework new static black hole solutions where p-form
fields allow to shape the geometry of the horizon. Secondly, we will present
the general extension of Einstein theory in any dimension which produces second
order field equations: Lovelock theory. We will determine in this context a
large class of solutions in dimension 6 for which the theory is reduced to
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory with the presence of p-form fields. Thirdly, we
will study a generalization of General Relativity in dimension 4 whose
modification is induced by a conformally coupled scalar field. We will namely
exhibit a new black hole solution with a flat horizon in the presence of
axionic fields. To conclude this thesis, thermodynamical aspects of these
gravitational theories will be studied. In this way, we will be able to
determine the mass and the charges of these new solutions and we will examine
phase transition phenomena in the presence of a conformally scalar field.

Crossover behavior of the $E1$ excitations is found, from the skin mode at low

selection can profoundly affect the genome-wide patterns of molecular
variation. We performed forward simulations under realistic gene-structure and
selection scenarios to investigate whether such linkage effects impinge on the
ability of the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test to infer the rate of positive
selection (\alpha) from polymorphism and divergence data. We find that in the
presence of slightly deleterious mutations, MK estimates of \alpha\ severely
underestimate the true rate of adaptation even if all polymorphisms with
population frequencies under 50% are excluded. Furthermore, already under
intermediate rates of adaptation, genetic draft substantially distorts the site
frequency spectra at neutral and functional sites from the expectations under
mutation-selection-drift balance. MK-type approaches that first infer
demography from synonymous sites and then use the inferred demography to
correct the estimation of \alpha\ obtain almost the correct \alpha\ in our
simulations. However, these approaches typically infer a severe past population
expansion although there was no such expansion in the simulations, casting
doubt on the accuracy of methods that infer demography from synonymous
polymorphism data. We suggest a simple asymptotic extension of the MK test that
should yield accurate estimates of \alpha\ even in the presence of linkage

analyzed for the generalized nonlinear Schroedinger equations with arbitrary

Bifurcation of linear-stability eigenvalues associated with this transcritical

it is shown that both solution branches undergo stability switching at the
transcritical bifurcation point. In addition, the two solution branches have
opposite linear stability. These stability properties closely resemble those

construct the black hole mass function (BHMF) and Eddington ratio distribution
function (ERDF) of X-ray-selected broad-line AGNs at z~1.4 in the Subaru
XMM-Newton Deep Survey field. In this redshift range, a significant part of the
accretion growth of SMBHs is thought to be taking place. Black hole masses of
X-ray-selected broad-line AGNs are estimated using the width of the broad MgII
line and the 3000A monochromatic luminosity. We supplement the MgII FWHM values
with the Ha FWHM obtained from our NIR spectroscopic survey. Using the black
hole masses of broad-line AGNs at redshifts between 1.18 and 1.68, the binned
broad-line AGN BHMF and ERDF are calculated using the Vmax method. To properly
account for selection effects that impact the binned estimates, we derive the
corrected broad-line AGN BHMF and ERDF by applying the Maximum Likelihood
method, assuming that the ERDF is constant regardless of the black hole mass.
We do not correct for the non-negligible uncertainties in virial BH mass
estimates. If we compare the corrected broad-line AGN BHMF with that in the
local Universe, the corrected BHMF at z~1.4 has a higher number density above
10^8 Msolar but a lower number density below that mass range. The evolution may
be indicative of a down-sizing trend of accretion activity among the SMBH
population. The evolution of broad-line AGN ERDF from z=1.4 to 0 indicates that
the fraction of broad-line AGNs with accretion rate close to the
Eddington-limit is higher at higher redshifts.

we reproduce an approximately equilateral shape from the superposition of

possible degeneracy between the equilateral-type non-Gaussianity typical of
models with non-canonical kinetic terms, such as DBI inflation, and an
equilateral-type shape arising from a superposition of resonant-type
contributions in theories with canonical kinetic terms. The absence of
oscillations in the 2-point function together with the structure of the
resonant $N$-point functions, imply that detection of equilateral
non-Gaussianity at a level greater than the PLANCK sensitivity of

questions arising from possible embeddings of this idea in a string theory

have been observed to host several giant clumps in their disks. They are
thought to correspond to early formative stages of disk galaxies. On the other
hand, halo objects, such as old globular clusters and halo stars, are likely to
consist of the oldest stars in a galaxy (age>10 Gyr), therefore the clumpy disk
formation can be presumed to take place in a pre-existing halo system. Aims:
Giant clumps are orbiting in the same direction in a premature disk and so
massive that they may be expected to interact gravitationally with halo objects
and exercise influence on kinematic state of the halo. Accordingly, I
scrutinize the possibility that the clumps leave a kinematic imprint of the
clumpy disk formation on a halo system. Methods: I perform a restricted N-body
calculation with a toy-model to study the kinematic influence on a halo by
orbital motions of clumps, examine dependence of the results on masses
(mass-loss), number and orbital radii of the clumps. Results: I will show that
halo objects can catch clump motions and acquire disky rotation in a dynamical
friction time-scale of the clumps, ~0.5 Gyr. The influence of clumps is limited
within a region around the disk, the halo system shows vertical gradients of
net rotation velocity and orbital eccentricity. The significance of the
kinematic influence strongly depends on the clump masses, the lower limit of
postulated clump mass would be 5x10^8 solar masses. The result depends also on
whether the clumps are subjected to rapid mass-loss or not, which is an open
question under debate in recent studies. The existence of such massive clumps
is not unrealistic, I therefore suggest that there could remain the imprints of
past clumpy disk formation in current galactic halos.

because it is based on a sprinkling process. A field-theoretic action for the
photon and a fermion is set up, in which the photon is assumed not to couple to
the defects directly, but via a scalar field. We are interested in signs for
Lorentz violation caused by the spacetime defects, which are expected to reveal
themselves in the photon sector. A modification of the photon dispersion

perturbation theory.
  The outcome of the calculation is that the photon dispersion law remains
conventional, if the defect distribution is dense, homogeneous, and isotropic.
This result sheds some new light on Lorentz violation in the framework of a
small-scale structure of spacetime. It shows that Lorentz invariance can be

  misspecified models"" by Stephen Walker",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Under model misspecification, the MLE generally converges to the pseudo-true
parameter, the parameter corresponding to the distribution within the model
that is closest to the distribution from which the data are sampled. In many
problems, the pseudo-true parameter corresponds to a population parameter of
interest, and so a misspecified model can provide consistent estimation for
this parameter. Furthermore, the well-known sandwich variance formula of
Huber(1967) provides an asymptotically accurate sampling distribution for the
MLE, even under model misspecification. However, confidence intervals based on
a sandwich variance estimate may behave poorly for low sample sizes, partly due
to the use of a plug-in estimate of the variance. From a Bayesian perspective,
plug-in estimates of nuisance parameters generally underrepresent uncertainty
in the unknown parameters, and averaging over such parameters is expected to
give better performance. With this in mind, we present a Bayesian sandwich
posterior distribution, whose likelihood is based on the sandwich sampling
distribution of the MLE. This Bayesian approach allows for the incorporation of
prior information about the parameter of interest, averages over uncertainty in
the nuisance parameter and is asymptotically robust to model misspecification.
In a small simulation study on estimating a regression parameter under
heteroscedasticity, the addition of accurate prior information and the
averaging over the nuisance parameter are both seen to improve the accuracy and
calibration of confidence intervals for the parameter of interest.

include applications to nonlinear diffusion equations, nonlinear wave equations
and nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations. As a consequence, previously
unknown nonlocal symmetries are exhibited for two examples of nonlinear wave
equations. Moreover, since the considered nonlinear reaction-diffusion
equations have no local conservation laws, previous methods do not yield
nonlocally related systems for such equations.

as sideband peaks around the carrier in the ion-cavity emission spectrum. By
minimizing the sideband height in the emission spectrum, we are able to reduce
the micromotion amplitude to approximately the spread of the ground state wave
function. This method is useful for cavity QED experiments as it allows for
efficient 3-D micromotion compensation despite optical access limitations
imposed by the cavity mirrors. We also show that sub-nanometer micromotion
compensation is possible with our current system.

other merger galaxies, the optical lines are emitted from gas photoionised by
the AGN and heated by the shocks in the extended NLR. The infrared lines are
better explained by the emission from gas close to the starburst. The starburst
dominates the infrared emission. [OI] and [CI] lines in the far-infrared are
formed in the internal region of extended clouds and are therefore absorbed,
while [CII] lines are emitted from the external edges of outflowing clouds. The
O/H relative abundances are about solar and N/H are higher than solar by a
factor of 1.5, throughout the starburst region, while in the AGN extended NLR
the O/H ratio is half solar. A relatively high dust-to-gas ratio is indicated
by modelling the dust reprocessed radiation peak consistently with
bremsstrahlung emitted from the clouds. The observed radio emission is thermal
bremsstrahlung, while synchrotron radiation created by the Fermi mechanism at

Li depletion in open clusters. In order to investigate whether the TCM can be
applied to the overshooting mixing outside the stellar convective core, new
observations of the eclipsing binary star HY Vir are adopted to calibrate the
overshooting mixing parameter. The main conclusions are as follows: (i) the TCM
parameters and the overshooting mixing parameter in the solar case are also
suitable for the eclipsing binary system HY Vir; (ii) the incomplete mixing
results in a continuous profile of the hydrogen abundance; (iii) the e-folding
length of the region, in which the hydrogen abundance changes due to the

reported so far. In the present study, Crithidia fasciculata, a widely used
model for therapeutic strategies against pathogenic trypanosomatids, was
targeted with Fe_{3}O_{4} magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) in order to remotely
provoke cell death using TVMFs. The MNPs with average sizes of d approx. 30 nm
were synthesized using a precipitation of FeSO_{4}4 in basic medium. The MNPs
were added to Crithidia fasciculata choanomastigotes in exponential phase and
incubated overnight. The amount of uploaded MNPs per cell was determined by
magnetic measurements. Cell viability using the MTT colorimetric assay and flow
cytometry showed that the MNPs were incorporated by the cells with no
noticeable cell-toxicity effects. When a TVMF (f = 249 kHz, H = 13 kA/m) was
applied to MNP-bearing cells, massive cell death was induced via a
non-apoptotic mechanism. No effects were observed by applying a TVMF on control

the extracellular medium during the experiments. Scanning Electron Microscopy
showed morphological changes after TVMF experiments. These data indicate (as a

of the momentum distributions into the mean-field and short-range correlations
(SRC) contributions. It is shown that at high values of the momentum $k$ the
high-momentum components ($k\gtrsim 1.5-2$ fm$^{-1}$) of all nuclei considered
are very similar, exhibiting the well-known scaling behavior with the mass
number $A$, independently of the used many-body approach and the details of the
bare $NN$ interaction. The number of $NN$ pairs in a given ($ST$) state, viz.,
($ST$)=(10), (00), (01), and (11), and the contribution of these states to the
nucleon momentum distributions are calculated. It is shown that, apart from the
(00) state, which has very small effects, all other spin-isospin states
contribute to the momentum distribution in a wide range of momenta. It is shown
that that for all nuclei considered the momentum distributions in the states
T=0 and T=1 exhibit at $k\gtrsim 1.5-2$ fm$^{-1}$ very similar behaviors, which
represents strong evidence of the A-independent character of SRCs. The ratio
$n_A(k)/n_D(k)$ is analyzed in detail stressing that in the SRC region it
always increases with the momentum and the origin of such an increase is
discussed and elucidated. The relationships between the one- and two-body
momentum distributions, considered in a previous paper, are discussed and
clarified, pointing out the relevant role played by the center-of-mass motion
of a correlated pair in the (10) state. The relationship of the present

sensors scattered around space take measurements of the spatial field at their
locations. In this paper we study the emerging paradigm of sampling and
reconstructing spatial fields using sensors that move through space. We show
that mobile sensing offers some unique advantages over static sensing in
sensing time-invariant bandlimited spatial fields. Since a moving sensor
encounters such a spatial field along its path as a time-domain signal, a
time-domain anti-aliasing filter can be employed prior to sampling the signal
received at the sensor. Such a filtering procedure, when used by a
configuration of sensors moving at constant speeds along equispaced parallel
lines, leads to a complete suppression of spatial aliasing in the direction of
motion of the sensors. We analytically quantify the advantage of using such a
sampling scheme over a static sampling scheme by computing the reduction in
sampling noise due to the filter. We also analyze the effects of non-uniform
sensor speeds on the reconstruction accuracy. Using simulation examples we
demonstrate the advantages of mobile sampling over static sampling in practical
problems.
  We extend our analysis to sampling and reconstruction schemes for monitoring
time-varying bandlimited fields using mobile sensors. We demonstrate that in
some situations we require a lower density of sensors when using a mobile
sensing scheme instead of the conventional static sensing scheme. The exact
advantage is quantified for a problem of sampling and reconstructing an audio
field.

revealed from the MS, BL, luminous AGB, and RGB stars. The young stars with
ages less than ~250Myr show a spatial distribution confined to its central
regions, and additionally the young MS stars exhibit an off-center density
peak. The intermediate-age and older stars are more spatially extended. SDIG is
dominated by intermediate-age stars with an average age of 6.4Gyr. The average
metallicity inferred is [M/H]\approx -1.5dex. Its SFH is consistent with a
constant SFR, except for ages younger than ~200Myr. The lifetime average SFR is
1.3x10^{-3} Mo/yr. More recently than 100Myr, there has been a burst of SF at a
rate ~2-3 times higher than the average SFR. The inferred recent SFR from CMD
modelling is higher than inferred from the Ha flux of the galaxy; we interpret
this to mean that the upper end of the IMF is not being fully sampled due to
the low SFR. Additionally, an observed lack of bright blue stars in the CMD
could indicate a downturn in SFR on 10^7-yr timescales. A previous SF
enhancement appears to have occurred between 600-1100Myr ago, with amplitude
similar to the most recent 100Myr. Older bursts of similar peak SFR and
duration would not be resolvable with these data. The observed enhancements in
SF suggest that SDIG is able to sustain a complex SFH without the effect of
interactions with its nearest massive galaxy. Integrating the SFR over the
entire history of SDIG yields a total stellar mass 1.77x10^{7}Mo, and a current
V-band stellar mass-to-light ratio 3.2Mo/Lo.

When combined with photometric constraints, the pulsation spectra of such
evolved stars not only reveal their radii, and hence distances, but also
provide well-constrained estimates of their masses, which are reliable proxies
for the ages of the stars. As a first application we consider red giants
observed by CoRoT in two different parts of the Milky Way, and determine
precise distances for ~2000 stars spread across nearly 15,000 pc of the
Galactic disc, exploring regions which are a long way from the solar

these two samples which, by comparison with predictions of synthetic models of
the Milky Way, we interpret as mainly due to the vertical gradient in the
distribution of stellar masses (hence ages) in the disc. In the future, the
availability of spectroscopic constraints for this sample of stars will not
only improve the age determination, but also provide crucial constraints on

giants have very slow rotation rates leading to a rotational splitting on the
level of a few tenth of a \mu Hz. Only from more than 1.5 years of consecutive
data from the NASA Kepler space telescope, these tiny variations could be
resolved. A qualitative comparison to theoretical models allowed constraining

method is based on a decomposition of the solution into mean and a random field
using a generic Karhunnen-Loeve expansion. The random field is represented as a
convolution of separable Hilbert spaces in stochastic and spacial dimensions
that are spectrally represented using respective orthogonal bases. In
particular, the present paper investigates generalized polynomial chaos bases
for stochastic dimension and eigenfunction bases for spacial dimension. Dynamic
orthogonality is used to derive closed form equations for the time evolution of
mean, spacial and the stochastic fields. The resultant system of equations
consists of a partial differential equation (PDE) that define dynamic evolution
of the mean, a set of PDEs to define the time evolution of eigenfunction bases,
while a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) define dynamics of the
stochastic field. This system of dynamic evolution equations efficiently
propagates the prior parametric uncertainty to the system response. The
resulting bi-orthogonal expansion of the system response is used to reformulate
the Bayesian inference for efficient exploration of the posterior distribution.
Efficacy of the proposed method is investigated for calibration of a 2D
transient diffusion simulator with uncertain source location and diffusivity.
Computational efficiency of the method is demonstrated against a Monte Carlo

Higgs boson with $m_h=125$ GeV, is starting to provide strong guidelines into
SUSY model building. For instance, the identification of such a state with the
lightest CP-even Higgs boson of the MSSM ($h^0$), requires large values of
$\tan\beta$ and/or heavy sfermions. One outcome of this result is the
possibility to solve the SUSY flavor and CP problems by decoupling, which
points towards some realization of Split-inspired SUSY scenarios, in which
scalars are much heavier than gauginos and higgsinos. However, we argue here
that the remaining Higgs bosons of the MSSM ($H^0$, $A^0$, $H^{\pm}$) do not
have to be as heavy as the sfermions, and having them with masses near the EW
scale does not pose any conflict with current MSSM constraints. We discuss then
some SUSY scenarios with heavy sfermions, from a bottom-up approach, which
contain the full Higgs sector, as well as a possible dark matter candidate,
with masses near the EW scale, and identify distinctive signals from these
scenarios that could be searched at the LHC.

sufficiently large, contains a monochromatic copy of S. Ramsey's theorem tells
us that for any r \geq 1 every 2-coloring of a sufficiently large r-uniform
hypergraph will contain a large monochromatic clique (a complete
subhypergraph): hence any set of vertices from Q_d that all have the same
weight is Ramsey. A natural question to ask is: which sets S corresponding to
unions of cliques of different weights from Q_d are Ramsey?
  The answer to this question depends on the number of cliques involved. In
particular we determine which unions of 2 or 3 cliques are Ramsey and then
show, using a probabilistic argument, that any non-trivial union of 39 or more
cliques of different weights cannot be Ramsey.
  A key tool is a lemma which reduces questions concerning monochromatic

several communities active on various technological infrastructures like

This constitutes a complex network of interconnected networks where users'
identities are spread and where information propagates navigating through
different communities and social platforms. In this article we introduce a
model for this layered scenario that we call multi-stratum network. Through a
theoretical discussion and the analysis of real-world data we show how not only
focusing on a single network may provide a very partial understanding of the

which the curves visit the points of any d'-dimensional axis-parallel space
that contains the origin. Similar generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are
described for several variants of Peano's curve (the original Peano curve, the
coil curve, the half-coil curve, and the Meurthe curve). The d-dimensional
harmonious Hilbert curves and the Meurthe curves have neutral orientation: as
compared to the curve as a whole, arbitrary pieces of the curve have each of d!
possible rotations with equal probability. Thus one could say these curves are
`statistically invariant' under rotation---unlike the Peano curves, the coil
curves, the half-coil curves, and the familiar generalization of Hilbert curves
by Butz and Moore.
  In addition, prompted by an application in the construction of R-trees, this
paper shows how to construct a 2d-dimensional generalized Hilbert or Peano
curve that traverses the points of a certain d-dimensional diagonally placed
subspace in the order of a given d-dimensional generalized Hilbert or Peano
curve.

light-element abundances (probing the BBN epoch) have hinted at the presence of
extra relativistic degrees of freedom, the so-called ""dark radiation."" We
present a model independent study to account for the dark radiation by means of
the right-handed partners of the three, left-handed, standard model neutrinos.
We show that milli-weak interactions of these Dirac states (through their
coupling to a TeV-scale Z' gauge boson) may allow the \nu_R's to decouple much
earlier, at a higher temperature, than their left-handed counterparts. If the
\nu_R's decouple during the quark-hadron crossover transition, they are
considerably cooler than the \nu_L's and contribute less than 3 extra
""equivalent neutrinos"" to the early Universe energy density. For decoupling in
this transition region, the 3 \nu_R generate \Delta N_\nu = 3(T_{\nu_R}/T_{\nu_
L})^4 < 3, extra relativistic degrees of freedom at BBN and at the CMB epochs.
Consistency with present constraints on dark radiation permits us to identify
the allowed region in the parameter space of Z' masses and couplings.
Remarkably, the allowed region is within the range of discovery of LHC14.

galactic rotation curves in the conformal gravity theory. In this work the
conformal theory was applied to a comprehensive, high quality sample of spiral
galaxies whose rotation curves extend well beyond the galactic optical disks.
On galactic scales the conformal gravitational theory departs from the standard
Newtonian theory in two distinct ways. One is a local way in which local matter
sources within galaxies generate not just Newtonian potentials but linear
potentials as well. The other is a global way in which two universal global
potentials, one linear the other quadratic, are generated by the rest of the
matter in the universe. The study involves a broad set of 138 spiral galaxies
of differing luminosities and sizes, and is augmented here through the
inclusion of an additional three tidal dwarf galaxies. With its linear and
quadratic potentials the conformal theory can account for the systematics of an
entire 141 galaxy sample without any need for galactic dark matter, doing so
with only one free parameter per galaxy, namely the visible galactic mass to
light ratio.

higher concentration of droplets bigger than 25 {\mu}m. Much bigger differences
are present when comparing modelled and observed droplet spectrum on specific

  Despite the fact that microphysics is formulated in a Lagrangian framework
the standard deviation of the cloud droplet distribution is larger than 1
{\mu}m. There is no significant narrowing of the cloud droplet distribution in
the up-drafts, but the distribution in the up-drafts is narrower than in the

picture with explicit solutions in gravity and gauge theory. We first derive
symplectic U(1) gauge fields starting from the Eguchi-Hanson metric in
four-dimensional Euclidean gravity. The result precisely reproduces the U(1)
gauge fields of the Nekrasov-Schwarz instanton previously derived from the
top-down approach. In order to clarify the role of noncommutative spacetime, we
take the Braden-Nekrasov U(1) instanton defined in ordinary commutative
spacetime and derive a corresponding gravitational metric. We show that the
K\""ahler manifold determined by the Braden-Nekrasov instanton exhibits a
spacetime singularity while the Nekrasov-Schwarz instanton gives rise to a
regular geometry-the Eguchi-Hanson space. This result implies that the
noncommutativity of spacetime plays an important role for the resolution of
spacetime singularities in general relativity. We also discuss how the
topological invariants associated with noncommutative U(1) instantons are
related to those of emergent four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds according to
the emergent gravity picture.

  strong B star HR7355","12 pages, accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sts323",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spectral and magnetic properties and variability of the B2Vnp
emission-line magnetosphere star HR7355 were analyzed. The object rotates at
almost 90% of the critical value, meaning it is a magnetic star for which
oblateness and gravity darkening effects cannot be ignored any longer. A
detailed modeling of the photospheric parameters indicate that the star is
significantly cooler than suggested by the B2 spectral type, with T_eff=17500K
atypically cool for a star with a helium enriched surface. The spectroscopic
variability of helium and metal lines due to the photospheric abundance pattern
is far more complex than a largely dipolar, oblique magnetic field of about 11
to 12kG may suggest. Doppler imaging shows that globally the most He enriched
areas coincide with the magnetic poles and metal enriched areas with the
magnetic equator. While most of the stellar surface is helium enriched with
respect to the solar value, some isolated patches are depleted. The stellar
wind in the circumstellar environment is governed by the magnetic field, i.e.
the stellar magnetosphere is rigidly corotating with the star. The
magnetosphere of HR7355 is similar to the well known \sigma Ori E: the gas
trapped in the magnetospheric clouds is fairly dense, and at the limit to being
optically thick in the hydrogen emission. Apart from a different magnetic
obliquity, HR7355 and the more recently identified HR5907 have virtually
identical stellar and magnetic parameters.

  Problems With General Losses",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transductive SVM (TSVM) is a well known semi-supervised large margin learning
method for binary text classification. In this paper we extend this method to
multi-class and hierarchical classification problems. We point out that the
determination of labels of unlabeled examples with fixed classifier weights is
a linear programming problem. We devise an efficient technique for solving it.
The method is applicable to general loss functions. We demonstrate the value of
the new method using large margin loss on a number of multi-class and
hierarchical classification datasets. For maxent loss we show empirically that
our method is better than expectation regularization/constraint and posterior
regularization methods, and competitive with the version of entropy
regularization method which uses label constraints.

  judgment","64 pages. Final preprint version. In press, Psychological Review",,,,"physics.data-an cs.AI stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The systematic biases seen in people's probability judgments are typically
taken as evidence that people do not reason about probability using the rules
of probability theory, but instead use heuristics which sometimes yield
reasonable judgments and sometimes systematic biases. This view has had a major
impact in economics, law, medicine, and other fields; indeed, the idea that
people cannot reason with probabilities has become a widespread truism. We
present a simple alternative to this view, where people reason about
probability according to probability theory but are subject to random variation
or noise in the reasoning process. In this account the effect of noise is
cancelled for some probabilistic expressions: analysing data from two
experiments we find that, for these expressions, people's probability judgments
are strikingly close to those required by probability theory. For other
expressions this account produces systematic deviations in probability
estimates. These deviations explain four reliable biases in human probabilistic
reasoning (conservatism, subadditivity, conjunction and disjunction fallacies).
These results suggest that people's probability judgments embody the rules of
probability theory, and that biases in those judgments are due to the effects
of random noise.
