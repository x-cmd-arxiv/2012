nearest neighbor plus weak finite range interactions of strength \lambda. We
rigorously establish one of the predictions of Conformal Field Theory (CFT),
namely the fact that at the critical temperature the finite size corrections to
the free energy are universal, in the sense that they are exactly independent
of the interaction. The corresponding central charge, defined in terms of the
coefficient of the first subleading term to the free energy, as proposed by
Affleck and Blote-Cardy-Nightingale, is constant and equal to 1/2 for all
0<\lambda<\lambda_0 and \lambda_0 a small but finite convergence radius. This
is one of the very few cases where the predictions of CFT can be rigorously
verified starting from a microscopic non solvable statistical model. The proof
uses a combination of rigorous renormalization group methods with a novel
partition function inequality, valid for ferromagnetic interactions.

Specifically, analytic results are obtained for the time dependence of the
expectation value of the spin, averaged over fluctuations, for Gaussian white
noise and Guassian colored noise, as well as non-Gaussian telegraph noise.
Fluctuations cause the decay of the average spin vector (decoherence). For
noise with finite temporal correlation time, a deterministic component of the
field can suppress decoherence of the spin component along the field. Hence,
decoherence can be manipulated by controlling the deterministic magnetic field.
A simple universal physical picture emerges which explains the mechanism of the

promising approach for realizing such magical cloaking in our real world would
be to use transformation optics, where an empty space with a distorted geometry
is imitated with a non-distorted space but filled with transformation medium
having appropriate permittivity and permeability. An important requirement for
true invisibility cloaks is nonreciprocity; that is, a person in the cloak
should not be seen from the outside but should be able to see the outside. This
invisibility cloak, or a nonreciprocal shield, cannot be created as far as we
stay in conventional transformation optics. Conventional transformation optics
is based on Riemann geometry with a metric tensor independent of direction, and
therefore cannot be used to design the nonreciprocal shield. To overcome this
problem, we propose an improved theory of transformation optics that is based
on Finsler geometry, an extended version of Riemann geometry. Our theory shows
that nonreciprocal shielding can be realized by covering cloaking space with
transformation medium having anisotropic, nonreciprocal permittivity and
permeability. This theory includes conventional transformation optics as
special cases. We show the method for designing the spatial distribution of the
permittivity and permeability required to make the nonreciprocal shield.

C-type asteroids and carbonaceous chondrites is proposed. Asteroids of C-type
and close BGF-types could form from hydrated silicate-organic matter
accumulated in the cores of water-differentiated (due to 26Al and other
short-lived isotopes decay) bodies existed in the growth zones of Jupiter.
Gravitational scattering of such bodies by Jupiter at its final stage of
formation to the main asteroid belt might have led to fragmentation and
re-accretion of their primitive materials on the surfaces of many asteroids
and/or asteroid parent bodies. The hypothesis makes clear a row of
long-standing puzzling facts, the main of which are as follows. The low-albedo
and carbonaceous-chondritic surface properties of (1) Ceres contradict to its
probable differentiated structure and icy crust (e. g., Thomas et al., 2005,
Nature 437: 224-226; Castillo-Rogez et al., 2010, Icarus 205, 443-459), but it
could be explained by the process of primitive matter fall. Atypical hydrated
silicates (probably, as a component of carbonaceous-chondritic matter) are
found on the surfaces of many asteroids of high-temperature types (Rivkin et
al., 1995, Icarus 117: 90-100; Rivkin et al., 2000, Icarus 145: 351-368;
Busarev, 1998, Icarus 131: 32-40; Busarev, 2002, Solar System Research 36:
39-47) that may be a consequence of the carbonaceous-chondritic matter
precipitation on their surfaces. Some carbonaceous chondrites are
unidirectionly magnetized (e. g., Stacey et al., 1961, J. Geophys. Res. 66:
1523-1534; Butler, 1972, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 17: 120-128) which may be a
result of their stay on the surface of an early differentiated asteroid parent
body having melted interiors and a strong magnetic field.

WASP-71 was previously hotter than 6250 K, and therefore might have been

populations have survived for millennia at high altitudes, suggesting that they
have adapted to hypoxic conditions. This hypothesis was recently corroborated
by studies of Tibetan highlanders, which showed that polymorphisms in candidate
genes show signatures of natural selection as well as well-replicated
association signals for variation in hemoglobin levels. We extended genomic
analysis to two Ethiopian ethnic groups: Amhara and Oromo. For each ethnic
group, we sampled low and high altitude residents, thus allowing genetic and
phenotypic comparisons across altitudes and across ethnic groups. Genome-wide
SNP genotype data were collected in these samples by using Illumina arrays. We
find that variants associated with hemoglobin variation among Tibetans or other
variants at the same loci do not influence the trait in Ethiopians. However, in
the Amhara, SNP rs10803083 is associated with hemoglobin levels at genome-wide
levels of significance. No significant genotype association was observed for
oxygen saturation levels in either ethnic group. Approaches based on allele
frequency divergence did not detect outliers in candidate hypoxia genes, but
the most differentiated variants between high- and lowlanders have a clear role
in pathogen defense. Interestingly, a significant excess of allele frequency
divergence was consistently detected for genes involved in cell cycle control,
DNA damage and repair, thus pointing to new pathways for high altitude
adaptations. Finally, a comparison of CpG methylation levels between high- and
lowlanders found several significant signals at individual genes in the Oromo.

identification and measurements of the particles' transverse momenta the
trigger selects particles originating from charm and beauty hadrons, which
typically fly a finite distance before decaying. The trigger reduces the
roughly 11\,MHz of bunch-bunch crossings that contain at least one inelastic

that quantum mechanics is about probabilistic correlations, i.e., about the
structure of information, since a theory of information is essentially a theory
of probabilistic correlations. To make this clear, it suffices to consider
measurements of two binary-valued observables, x with outcomes a = 0 or 1,
performed by Alice in a region A, and y with outcomes b = 0 or 1 performed by
Bob in a separated region B --or, to emphasize the banality of the phenomena,
two ways of peeling a banana, resulting in one of two tastes. The imagined
bananas of Bananaworld are non-standard, with operational or phenomenal
probabilistic correlations for peelings and tastes that lie outside the
polytope of local correlations. The 'no go' theorems tell us that we can't
shoe-horn these correlations into a classical correlation polytope, which has
the structure of a simplex, by supposing that something has been left out of
the story, without giving up fundamental principles that define what we mean by
a physical system. The nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, including
the irreducible information loss on measurement, are shown to be generic

  Estimation with Application to Pose Graph Optimization","24 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.RO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating the orientations of nodes in a pose graph from relative angular
measurements is challenging because the variables live on a manifold product
with nontrivial topology and the maximum-likelihood objective function is
non-convex and has multiple local minima; these issues prevent iterative
solvers to be robust for large amounts of noise. This paper presents an
approach that allows working around the problem of multiple minima, and is
based on the insight that the original estimation problem on orientations is
equivalent to an unconstrained quadratic optimization problem on integer
vectors. This equivalence provides a viable way to compute the maximum
likelihood estimate and allows guaranteeing that such estimate is almost surely
unique. A deeper consequence of the derivation is that the maximum likelihood
solution does not necessarily lead to an estimate that is ""close"" to the actual
nodes orientations, hence it is not necessarily the best choice for the problem
at hand. To alleviate this issue, our algorithm computes a set of estimates,
for which we can derive precise probabilistic guarantees. Experiments show that
the method is able to tolerate extreme amounts of noise (e.g., {\sigma} =
30{\deg} on each measurement) that are above all noise levels of sensors
commonly used in mapping. For most range-finder-based scenarios, the
multi-hypothesis estimator returns only a single hypothesis, because the
problem is very well constrained. Finally, using the orientations estimate
provided by our method to bootstrap the initial guess of pose graph
optimization methods improves their robustness and makes them avoid local
minima even for high levels of noise.

metallic CNTs the RKKY interaction depends strongly on the sublattice and, at
the Dirac point, is purely ferromagnetic (antiferromagnetic) for the localized
spins on the same (different) sublattice, whereas in semiconducting CNTs the
spin susceptibility depends only weakly on the sublattice and is dominantly
ferromagnetic. The spin orbit interactions break the SU(2) spin symmetry of the

Lacertae on 2011 June 28 with the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope
Array System (VERITAS). The flaring activity was observed during a 34.6-minute
exposure, when the integral flux above 200 GeV reached $(3.4\pm0.6) \times
10^{-6} \;\text{photons}\;\text{m}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$, roughly 125% of the Crab
Nebula flux measured by VERITAS. The light curve indicates that the
observations missed the rising phase of the flare but covered a significant
portion of the decaying phase. The exponential decay time was determined to be
$13\pm4$ minutes, making it one of the most rapid gamma-ray flares seen from a
TeV blazar. The gamma-ray spectrum of BL Lacertae during the flare was soft,
with a photon index of $3.6\pm 0.4$, which is in agreement with the measurement
made previously by MAGIC in a lower flaring state. Contemporaneous radio
observations of the source with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) revealed
the emergence of a new, superluminal component from the core around the time of
the TeV gamma-ray flare, accompanied by changes in the optical polarization
angle. Changes in flux also appear to have occurred at optical, UV, and GeV
gamma-ray wavelengths at the time of the flare, although they are difficult to
quantify precisely due to sparse coverage. A strong flare was seen at radio
wavelengths roughly four months later, which might be related to the gamma-ray
flaring activities. We discuss the implications of these multiwavelength
results.

dynamics occur mostly within 50 {\mu}s after the first contact, requiring
imaging at 1 million frames/sec. For a water drop impacting onto a thin layer
of water, the entrapment of isolated bubbles starts through azimuthal
instability, which forms at low impact velocities, in the neck connecting the
drop and pool. For Re above about 12 000, up to 10 partial bubble-rings have
been observed at the base of the ejecta, starting when the contact is about 20%
of the drop size. More regular bubble rings are observed for a pool of ethanol

cylinders, which can temporarily delay their breakup into microbubbles. The
different refractive index in the pool liquid reveals the destabilization of
the vortices and the formation of streamwise vortices and intricate vortex
tangles. Fine-scale axisymmetry is thereby destroyed. We show also that the
shape of the drop has a strong influence on these dynamics.

mean motion resonances, this paper explores a related type of dynamical
behavior known as ""nodding"". Here, the resonance angle of a planetary system
executes libration (oscillatory motion) for several cycles, circulates for one
or more cycles, and then enters once again into libration. This type of
complicated dynamics can affect our interpretation of observed planetary
systems that are in or near mean motion resonance. This work shows that
planetary systems in (near) mean motion resonance can exhibit nodding behavior,
and outlines the portion of parameter space where it occurs. This problem is
addressed using both full numerical integrations of the planetary systems and
via model equations obtained through expansions of the disturbing function. In
the latter approach, we identify the relevant terms that allow for nodding. The
two approaches are in agreement, and show that nodding often occurs when a
small body is in an external mean motion resonance with a larger planet. As a
result, the nodding phenomenon can be important for interpreting observations
of transit timing variations, where the existence of smaller bodies is inferred
through their effects on larger, observed transiting planets. For example, in
actively nodding planetary systems, both the amplitude and frequency of the
transit timing variations depend on the observational time window.

replaced by a related characteristic-value function and this related
optimization problem can be solved in closed form. The solution of this problem
is shown to approach the solution of the original problem in the limit as the
boundary conditions approach those of a circular orbit. Using a form of
primer-vector theory the problem is formulated in a way that leads to
relatively easy calculation of the optimal velocity increments. A certain

the number of impulses required for solution of the optimization problem and
also is useful in the computation of these velocity increments.

problems that have been receiving increasing attention in recent years. One is
to extract the topics covered by the event and the tweets; the other is to
segment the event. So far these problems have been viewed separately and
studied in isolation. In this work, we argue that these problems are in fact
inter-dependent and should be addressed together. We develop a joint Bayesian
model that performs topic modeling and event segmentation in one unified
framework. We evaluate the proposed model both quantitatively and qualitatively
on two large-scale tweet datasets associated with two events from different
domains to show that it improves significantly over baseline models.

assumptions about the interstellar extinction. Most of the extinction maps
available in the literature lack the information about the distance.
  We combine the observations with the Besancon model of the Galaxy to
investigate the variations of extinction along different lines of sight towards
the inner Galactic bulge as a function of distance. In addition we study the
variations in the extinction law in the Bulge. We construct color-magnitude
diagrams with the following sets of colors: H-Ks and J-Ks from the VVV
catalogue as well as Ks-[3.6], Ks-[4.5], Ks-[5.8] and Ks-[8.0] from GLIMPSE-II
catalogue matched with 2MASS. Using the newly derived temperature-color
relation for M giants that match better the observed color-magnitude diagrams
we then use the distance-color relations to derive the extinction as a function
of distance. The observed colors are shifted to match the intrinsic colors in
the Besan\c{c}on model, as a function of distance, iteratively thereby creating
an extinction map with three dimensions: two spatial and one distance dimension
along each line of sight towards the bulge. Colour excess maps are presented at
a resolution of 15' x 15' for 6 different combinations of colors, in distance
bins of 1 kpc. The high resolution and depth of the photometry allows to derive
extinction maps to 10 kpc distance and up to 35 magnitudes of extinction in Av
(3.5 mag in Aks). Integrated maps show the same dust features and consistent
values with the other 2D maps. Starting from the color excess between the
observations and the model we investigate the extinction law in near-infrared

\pi_k(X), as well as the first k stages of a Postnikov system of X. Combined
with results of an earlier paper, this yields a polynomial-time computation of
[X,Y], i.e., all homotopy classes of continuous mappings X -> Y, under the

polynomial-time solution of the extension problem, where the input consists of
finite simplicial complexes X,Y, where Y is (k-1)-connected and dim X < 2k,

Our polynomial-time algorithms are obtained by showing that simplicial sets
with polynomial-time homology are closed under various operations, most
notably, Cartesian products, twisted Cartesian products, and classifying space.

of light at large radius which follows the very extended HI disk to the

detect another, redder spur of extended light to the east of the disk, and both

the ability to study star formation histories and stellar populations in outer

asteroids are a major feature in the solar system. Based upon the thermal

consist of fine-grained silicates suspended in a transparent matrix.
  To explore the transparent matrix hypothesis, we adopted a modified radiative
transfer model to fit the Trojan spectra simultaneously both in the near and
the thermal infrared regions. Our model shows that the Trojan spectra over a
wide wavelength range can be consistently explained by fine grained silicates
(1-5 wt.%) and highly absorbing material (e.g. carbon or iron, 2-10 wt.%)
suspended in a transparent matrix. The matrix is consistent with a deposit of
salt on the surfaces of the large Trojans. However, this consistency is not an
actual detection of salt and other alternatives may still be possible. We
suggest that early in the Solar System history, short-lived radionuclides
heated ice-rich Trojans and caused melting, internal circulation of water and
dissolution of soluble materials. Briny water volcanism were facilitated by
internal volatiles and a possibly global sill of frozen brine was formed
beneath the cold primitive crust. The frozen brine layer was likely to be
evacuated by impact erosions and evaporation of the exposed brines eventually
left a lag deposit of salt. Over the Solar System's history, fine dust from
comets or impacts contaminated and colored these salty surfaces of the Trojans
to produce the spectral properties observed today.

future: global economic wealth has a fixed link to civilization's overall rate
of energy consumption from all sources; the ratio of these two quantities has
not changed over the past 40 years that statistics are available. Power
production and wealth rise equally quickly because civilization, like any other
system in the universe, must consume and dissipate its energy reserves in order
to sustain its current size. One perspective might be that financial wealth
must ultimately collapse as we deplete our energy reserves. However, we can
also expect that highly aggregated quantities like global wealth have inertia,
and that growth rates must persist. Exceptionally rapid innovation in the two
decades following 1950 allowed for unprecedented acceleration of
inflation-adjusted rates of return. But today, real innovation rates are more
stagnant. This means that, over the coming decade or so, global GDP and wealth
should rise fairly steadily at an inflation-adjusted rate of about 2.2% per
year.

properties expected of a galaxy at z~10 showing (1) no detection in the deep
ACS+WFC3 imaging data blueward of the F160W band, exhibiting (2) a blue
spectral slope redward of the break, and showing (3) no prominent detection in
deep IRAC observations. The new, similarly deep WFC3/IR HUDF12 F160W
observations over the HUDF09/XDF allow us to further assess this candidate.
These observations show that this candidate, previously only detected at ~5.9
sigma in a single band, clearly corresponds to a real source. It is detected at
~5.3 sigma in the new H-band data and at ~7.8 sigma in the full 85-orbit H-band
stack. Interestingly, the non-detection of the source (<1 sigma) in the new
F140W observations suggests a higher redshift. Formally, the best-fit redshift
of the source utilizing all the WFC3+ACS (and IRAC+K-band) observations is
11.8+/-0.3. However, we consider the z~12 interpretation somewhat unlikely,
since the source would either need to be ~20x more luminous than expected or
show very high-EW Ly-alpha emission (which seems improbable given the extensive
neutral gas prevalent early in the reionization epoch). Lower-redshift
solutions fail if only continuum models are allowed. Plausible lower-redshift
solutions require that the H-band flux be dominated by line emission such as
Halpha or [OIII] with extreme EWs. The tentative detection of line emission at
1.6 microns in UDFj-39546284 in a companion paper suggests that such emission
may have already been found.

long observations of this source taken early in its outburst, when the PCA 2-20
keV count rate was >70 counts/s/PCU, as well as several combined observations
from different stages of the outburst. The spectra are best fit with an
absorbed cutoff power law with a ~6.4 keV iron emission line and a Gaussian
optical depth absorption line at ~10 keV. We present strong evidence that this
absorption-like feature is a cyclotron resonance scattering feature, making
Swift J1626.6-5156 a new candidate cyclotron line source. The redshifted energy
of ~10 keV implies a magnetic field strength of ~8.6(1+z) x 10^11 G in the
region of the accretion column close to the magnetic poles where the cyclotron
line is produced. Analysis of phase averaged spectra spanning the duration of
the outburst suggests a possible positive correlation between the fundamental
cyclotron energy and source luminosity. Phase resolved spectroscopy from a long
observation reveals a variable cyclotron line energy, with phase dependence
similar to a variety of other pulsars, as well as the first harmonic of the
fundamental cyclotron line.

with thermal emission from the nova ejecta. However, the radio flux began
rising surprisingly late in the outburst, indicating that the bulk of the

cosmological $N$-body + Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations that NCCs are often
consistent with early major mergers events that destroy embryonic CCs. In this

different methods of gas cooling, and of energy and metal feedback from
supernovae, where we attempt to produce a population of clusters with realistic

metallicity-dependent gas cooling is essential to prevent early overcooling,and
that adjusting the amount of energy and metal feedback can have a significant
impact on observable X-ray quantities of the gas. We are able to produce
clusters with more realistic central observable quantities than have previously
been attained. However, there are still significant discrepancies between the
simulated clusters and observations, which indicates that a different approach
to simulating galaxies in clusters is needed. We conclude by looking towards a
promising subgrid method of modeling galaxy feedback in clusters which may help
to ameliorate the discrepancies between simulations and observations.

Uncertainties related to the destruction of lithium in stars can be
circumvented if lithium abundance is measured in the ""pristine"" gas of the low

another post-BBN production channel of lithium, which could present an
important addition to the observed SMC lithium abundance. Besides standard

turbulent gas. Although it is known that when gas is isothermal, the PDF is
approximately lognormal in the core, high-resolution simulations show large
deviations from exact log-normality. The proposed function provides an
extraordinarily accurate description of the density PDFs in simulations with
Mach numbers ~0.1-15 and dispersion in log(rho) from ~0.01-4 dex. Compared to a
lognormal or lognormal-skew-kurtosis model, the fits are improved by orders of
magnitude in the wings of the distribution (with fewer free parameters). This
is true in simulations using distinct numerical methods, including or excluding
magnetic fields. Deviations from lognormality are represented by a parameter T
that increases with the compressive Mach number. The proposed distribution can
be derived from intermittent cascade models of the longitudinal (compressive)
velocity differences, which should be directly related to density fluctuations,
and we provide a simple interpretation of the density PDF as the product of a
continuous-time relaxation process. As such the parameter T is consistent with
the same parameter needed to explain the (intermittent) velocity structure
functions; its behavior is consistent with turbulence becoming more
intermittent as it becomes more dominated by strong shocks. It provides a new
and unique probe of the role of intermittency in the density (not just
velocity) structure of turbulence. We show that this naturally explains some
apparent contradictory results in the literature based on use of different
moments of the density PDF, as well as differences based on whether
volume-weighted or mass-weighted quantities are measured. We show how these are
fundamentally related to the fact that mass conservation requires violations of
log-normal statistics.

the assumed star formation law, the equation of state imposed on the unresolved
interstellar medium, the stellar initial mass function, the reionization
history, and the assumed cosmology. This work complements that of Paper I,
where we studied the effects of varying models for galactic winds driven by
star formation and AGN. The normalisation of the matter power spectrum strongly
affects the galaxy mass function, but has a relatively small effect on the
physical properties of galaxies residing in haloes of a fixed mass.
Reionization suppresses the stellar masses and gas fractions of low-mass
galaxies, but by z = 2 the results are insensitive to the timing of
reionization. The stellar initial mass function mainly determines the physical
properties of galaxies through its effect on the efficiency of the feedback,
while changes in the recycled mass and metal fractions play a smaller role. If
we use a recipe for star formation that reproduces the observed star formation
law independently of the assumed equation of state of the unresolved ISM, then
the latter is unimportant. The star formation law, i.e. the gas consumption
time scale as a function of surface density, determines the mass of dense,
star-forming gas in galaxies, but affects neither the star formation rate nor
the stellar mass. This can be understood in terms of self-regulation: the gas
fraction adjusts until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.

in the radio wavelengths. In order to properly model this emission, we utilize
the adaptive mesh refinement simulation of the magnetohydrodynamic evolution of
a galaxy cluster from cosmological initial conditions. We locate shock fronts
and apply models of cosmic ray electron acceleration that are then input into
radio emission models. We have determined the thermodynamic properties of this
radio-emitting plasma and constructed synthetic radio observations to compare
to observed galaxy clusters. We find a significant dependence of the observed
morphology and radio relic properties on the viewing angle of the cluster,

condensates (BEC's) following a quench from one component BEC's with a ${\rm

U}(1)\shorttimes{\rm Z}_2$ order parameter. In our case, these two spin
components have a propensity to phase separate, i.e., they are immiscible.
Remarkably, these spin degrees of freedom can equivalently be described as a
single component attractive BEC. A spatially uniform mixture of these spins is
dynamically unstable, rapidly amplifing any quantum or pre-existing classical
spin fluctuations. This coherent growth process drives the formation of
numerous spin polarized domains, which are far from the system's ground state.
At much longer times these domains grow in size, coarsening, as the system
approaches equilibrium. The experimentally observed time evolution is fully
consistent with our stochastic-projected Gross-Pitaevskii calculation.

correcting codes are presented. In particular, the largest single-deletion
correcting code for $q$-ary alphabet and string length $n$ is shown to be of
size at most $\frac{q^n-q}{(q-1)(n-1)}$. An improved bound on the asymptotic
rate function is obtained as a corollary. Upper bounds are also derived on
sizes of codes for a constrained source that does not necessarily comprise of
all strings of a particular length, and this idea is demonstrated by
application to sets of run-length limited strings.
  The problem of finding the largest deletion correcting code is modeled as a
matching problem on a hypergraph. This problem is formulated as an integer
linear program. The upper bound is obtained by the construction of a feasible
point for the dual of the linear programming relaxation of this integer linear
program.
  The non-asymptotic bounds derived imply the known asymptotic bounds of
Levenshtein and Tenengolts and improve on known non-asymptotic bounds.
Numerical results support the conjecture that in the binary case, the
Varshamov-Tenengolts codes are the largest single-deletion correcting codes.

Seeking to
explore the convective origins of this activity, we have carried out a series
of global 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the anelastic spherical
harmonic (ASH) code. Here we report on the dynamo mechanisms achieved as the
effects of artificial diffusion are systematically decreased. The simulations
are carried out at a nominal rotation rate of three times the solar value
(3$\Omega_\odot$), but similar dynamics may also apply to the Sun. Our previous
simulations demonstrated that convective dynamos can build persistent toroidal
flux structures (magnetic wreaths) in the midst of a turbulent convection zone
and that high rotation rates promote the cyclic reversal of these wreaths. Here
we demonstrate that magnetic cycles can also be achieved by reducing the
diffusion, thus increasing the Reynolds and magnetic Reynolds numbers. In these
more turbulent models, diffusive processes no longer play a significant role in
the key dynamical balances that establish and maintain the differential
rotation and magnetic wreaths. Magnetic reversals are attributed to an
imbalance in the poloidal magnetic induction by convective motions that is
stabilized at higher diffusion levels. Additionally, the enhanced levels of
turbulence lead to greater intermittency in the toroidal magnetic wreaths,
promoting the generation of buoyant magnetic loops that rise from the deep
interior to the upper regions of our simulated domain. The implications of such
turbulence-induced magnetic buoyancy for solar and stellar flux emergence are
also discussed.

broadening the baryon-acoustic-oscillation (BAO) feature that was imprinted
when baryons were strongly coupled to photons. Additionally, there is a small
shift inward in the peak of the conventional overdensity correlation function,
a mass-weighted statistic. This shift occurs when high density peaks move
toward each other. We explore whether this shift can be removed by applying to
the density field a transform (such as a logarithm) that gives fairer
statistical weight to fluctuations in underdense regions. Using
configuration-space perturbation theory in the Zel'dovich approximation, we
find that the log-density correlation function shows a much smaller inward
shift in the position of the BAO peak at low redshift than is seen in the
overdensity correlation function. We also show that if the initial, Lagrangian
density of matter parcels could be estimated at their Eulerian positions,
giving a displaced-initial-density field, its peak shift would be even smaller.
In fact, a transformed field that accentuates underdensities, such as the
reciprocal of the density, pushes the peak the other way, outward. In our
model, these shifts in the peak position can be attributed to shift terms,
involving the derivative of the linear correlation function, that entirely
vanish in this displaced-initial-density field.

confidence. We consider high-resolution spectra of the planetary nebula Mo-17,
and conclude that this object is also a member of the cluster. Our measured
radial velocities allow us to conduct a detailed investigation of the internal
kinematics of NGC 1846, the first time this has been done for an EMSTO system.
The key result of this work is that the cluster exhibits a significant degree
of systemic rotation, of a magnitude comparable to the mean velocity
dispersion. Using an extensive suite of Monte Carlo models we demonstrate that,
despite our relatively small sample size and the substantial fraction of
unresolved binary stars in the cluster, the rotation signal we detect is very
likely to be genuine. Our observations are in qualitative agreement with the
predictions of simulations modeling the formation of multiple populations of
stars in globular clusters, where a dynamically cold, rapidly rotating second
generation is a common feature. NGC 1846 is less than one relaxation time old,
so any dynamical signatures encoded during its formation ought to remain
present.

diagrammatic perturbation series that are free of pinch singularities, without
the need to resort to quasi-particle approximation or effective resummations of
finite widths. In our formalism, the avoidance of pinch singularities is a
consequence of the consistent inclusion of finite-time effects and the proper
consideration of the time of observation. After introducing a physically
meaningful definition of particle number densities, we derive master time
evolution equations for statistical distribution functions, which are valid to
all orders in perturbation theory. The resulting equations do not rely upon a
gradient expansion of Wigner transforms or involve any separation of time
scales. To illustrate the key features of our formalism, we study
out-of-equilibrium decay dynamics of unstable particles in a simple scalar
model. In particular, we show how finite-time effects remove the pinch
singularities and lead to violation of energy conservation at early times,
giving rise to otherwise kinematically forbidden processes. The non-Markovian

demonstrated.

enhanced relative to Fe in half the sample; and for Z > 20 (Ca) there is little
evidence for enhancements relative to solar values. These results are best
explained in terms of the admixing and processing of material from H-burning
and He-burning regions as achieved by nucleosynthesis in zero-heavy-element
models in the literature of ""mixing and fallback"" supernovae (SNe); of
rotating, massive and intermediate mass stars; and of Type II SNe with
relativistic jets. The available (limited) radial velocities offer little
support for the C-rich stars with [Fe/H] < -3.1 being binary. More data are
required before one could conclude that binarity is key to an understanding of
this population. We suggest that the C-rich and C-normal populations result
from two different gas cooling channels in the very early Universe, of material
that formed the progenitors of the two populations. The first was cooling by
fine-structure line transitions of CII and OI (to form the C-rich population);
the second, while not well-defined (perhaps dust-induced cooling?), led to the
C-normal group. In this scenario, the C-rich population contains the oldest
stars currently observed.

Relatively high stratification and moderate Reynolds numbers are considered,
and a particular emphasis is placed on the role of helicity (velocity-vorticity
correlations). The problem is tackled by integrating the Boussinesq equations
in a periodic cubical domain using different initial conditions: a non-helical
Taylor-Green (TG) flow, a fully helical Beltrami (ABC) flow, and random flows
with a tunable helicity. We show that for stratified ABC flows helicity
undergoes a substantially slower decay than for unstratified ABC flows. This
fact is likely associated to the combined effect of stratification and large
scale coherent structures. Indeed, when the latter are missing, as in random
flows, helicity is rapidly destroyed by the onset of gravitational waves. A
type of large-scale dissipative ""cyclostrophic"" balance can be invoked to
explain this behavior. When helicity survives in the system it strongly affects
the temporal energy decay and the energy distribution among Fourier modes. We
discover in fact that the decay rate of energy for stratified helical flows is
much slower than for stratified non-helical flows and can be considered with a
phenomenological model in a way similar to what is done for unstratified
rotating flows. We also show that helicity, when strong, has a measurable
effect on the Fourier spectra, in particular at scales larger than the buoyancy
scale for which it displays a rather flat scaling associated with vertical
shear.

  a review",,,"10.3390/e15010113",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This report reviews the conceptual and theoretical links between Granger
causality and directed information theory. We begin with a short historical
tour of Granger causality, concentrating on its closeness to information
theory. The definitions of Granger causality based on prediction are recalled,
and the importance of the observation set is discussed. We present the
definitions based on conditional independence. The notion of instantaneous
coupling is included in the definitions. The concept of Granger causality
graphs is discussed. We present directed information theory from the
perspective of studies of causal influences between stochastic processes.
Causal conditioning appears to be the cornerstone for the relation between
information theory and Granger causality. In the bivariate case, the
fundamental measure is the directed information, which decomposes as the sum of
the transfer entropies and a term quantifying instantaneous coupling. We show
the decomposition of the mutual information into the sums of the transfer
entropies and the instantaneous coupling measure, a relation known for the
linear Gaussian case. We study the multivariate case, showing that the useful
decomposition is blurred by instantaneous coupling. The links are further
developed by studying how measures based on directed information theory
naturally emerge from Granger causality inference frameworks as hypothesis
testing.

transition-type dwarf galaxies in the Sculptor group, with the aim to examine
the potential presence of population gradients and place constraints on their
mean metallicities. We use deep HST images to construct CMDs, from which we
select stellar populations that trace different evolutionary phases in order to
constrain their range of ages and metallicities, as well as to examine their
spatial distribution. In addition, we use the resolved stars in the RGB in
order to derive photometric metallicities. All studied dwarfs contain
intermediate-age stars with ages of ~1Gyr and older as traced by the luminous
asymptotic giant branch and red clump stars, while the transition-type dwarfs
contain also stars younger than ~1Gyr as traced by a young main sequence and
vertical red clump stars. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the stars that
trace different evolutionary phases shows a population gradient in all
transition-type dwarfs. The derived error-weighted mean metallicities, assuming
purely old stellar populations, range from -1.5dex for ESO294-G010 to -1.9dex
for Scl-dE1, and should be considered as lower limits to their true
metallicities. Assuming intermediate-age stellar populations to dominate the
dwarfs, we derive upper limits for the metallicities that are 0.3 to 0.2 dex
higher than the metallicities derived assuming purely old populations. We
discuss how photometric metallicity gradients are affected by the
age-metallicity degeneracy, which prevents strong conclusions regarding their
actual presence. Finally, the transition-type dwarfs lie beyond the virial
radius of their closest bright galaxy, as also observed for the LG
transition-type dwarfs. Scl-dE1 is the only dSph in our sample and is an
outlier in a potential morphology-distance relation, similar as the two
isolated dSphs of the LG, Tucana and Cetus.

how to obtain robust polarisation-invariant responses of different types of

responses of any scattering system with a rotational symmetry with respect to
an axis parallel to the propagation direction of the incident wave. We
demonstrate that the optical responses such as extinction, scattering, and
absorption, can be made independent of the polarisation of the incident wave
for all wavelengths. Such polarisation-independent responses are proven to be a
robust and generic feature that is purely due to the rotational symmetry of the
whole structure. We anticipate our finding will play a significant role in
various applications involving light scattering such as sensing, nanoantennas,
optical switches, and photovoltaic devices.

superconducting transition manifests itself by zero resistance and large
diamagnetic susceptibility. The specific heat exhibits a Schottky anomaly
peaking at 14 K and magnetization curves measured at 2 K show anisotropic
behaviors. The analysis of these data indicates that the crystalline electric
field (CEF) ground state of the trivalent Pr ion is the non-Kramers Gamma3
doublet with the quadrupolar degrees of freedom. A sharp peak in the specific
heat at 0.06 K has been attributed not to the superconducting transition but to
the AFQ transition because the ordering temperature TQ decreases in B || [100]
but increases in B || [110] and B || [111] with increasing B up to 6 T. This
anisotropic behavior of TQ(B) can be well explained by a two-sublattice
mean-field calculation, which corroborates the AFQ ordered state below TQ. The
entropy release at TQ is only 10% of Rln2 expected for the Gamma3 doublet,
suggesting possible interplay between the quadrupolar degrees of freedom and
the superconductivity.

usual Macdonald polynomials. The starting point of this work is the observation
of a previously unnoticed stability property of the Macdonald superpolynomials
when the fermionic sector m is sufficiently large: their decomposition in the
monomial basis is then independent of m. These stable superpolynomials are
readily mapped into bisymmetric polynomials, an operation that spoils the ring
structure but drastically simplifies the associated vector space. Our main
result is a factorization of the (stable) bisymmetric Macdonald polynomials,
called double Macdonald polynomials and indexed by pairs of partitions, into a
product of Macdonald polynomials (albeit subject to non-trivial plethystic
transformations). As an off-shoot, we note that, after multiplication by a
t-Vandermonde determinant, this provides explicit formulas for a large class of
Macdonald polynomials with prescribed symmetry. The factorization of the double
Macdonald polynomials leads immediately to the generalization of basically
every elementary properties of the Macdonald polynomials to the double case
(norm, kernel, duality, positivity, etc). When lifted back to superspace, this
validates various previously formulated conjectures in the stable regime.
  The q,t-Kostka coefficients associated to the double Macdonald polynomials
are shown to be q,t-analogs of the dimensions of the irreducible
representations of the hyperoctahedral group B_n. Moreover, a Nabla operator on
the double Macdonald polynomials is defined and its action on a certain
bisymmetric Schur function can be interpreted as the Frobenius series of a
bigraded module of dimension (2n+1)^n, a formula again characteristic of the
Coxeter group of type B_n.
  Finally, as a side result, we obtain a simple identity involving products of
four Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.

It is
also a conserved quantity as Berger in 1984 demonstrated that the total
magnetic helicity is still conserved in the corona even when there is a fast
magnetic reconnection. It is generally believed that solar magnetic fields,
together with their helicity, are created in the convection zone by various
dynamo processes. These fields and helicity are transported into the corona
through solar photosphere and finally released into the interplanetary space
via various processes such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and solar winds.
Here I will give a brief review on our recent works, first on helicity
observations on the photosphere and how to understand these observations via
dynamo models. Mostly, I will talk about what are the possible consequences of
magnetic helicity accumulation in the corona, namely, the formation of magnetic
flux ropes, CMEs taking place as an unavoidable product of coronal evolution,
and flux emergences as a trigger of CMEs. Finally, I will address on in what a
form magnetic field in the interplanetary space would accommodate a large
amount of magnetic helicity that solar dynamo processes have been continuously
producing.

repressive regimes, leading them to develop and deploy censorship mechanisms
within their networks. Unfortunately, existing censorship circumvention systems
do not provide high availability guarantees to their users, as censors can
identify, hence disrupt, the traffic belonging to these systems using today's
advanced censorship technologies. In this paper we propose SWEET, a highly
available censorship-resistant infrastructure. SWEET works by encapsulating a
censored user's traffic to a proxy server inside email messages that are
carried over by public email service providers, like Gmail and Yahoo Mail. As
the operation of SWEET is not bound to specific email providers we argue that a
censor will need to block all email communications in order to disrupt SWEET,
which is infeasible as email constitutes an important part of today's Internet.
Through experiments with a prototype of our system we find that SWEET's
performance is sufficient for web traffic. In particular, regular websites are
downloaded within couple of seconds.

find the near-linear relation M_(bh) ~ L_(K_s)^(1.10+/-0.20) for the
core-Sersic spheroids thought to be built in additive dry merger events, while
M_(bh) ~ L_(K_s)^(2.73+/-0.55) for the Sersic spheroids built from gas-rich
processes. After converting literature B-band disk galaxy magnitudes into
inclination- and dust-corrected bulge magnitudes, via a useful new equation
presented herein, we obtain a similar result. Unlike with the M_(bh)-sigma
diagram, which is also updated here using the same galaxy sample, it remains
unknown whether barred and non-barred Sersic galaxies are offset from each
other in the M_(bh)-L diagram.
  While black hole feedback has typically been invoked to explain what was
previously thought to be a nearly constant M_bh/M_sph mass ratio of ~0.2%, we
advocate that the near-linear M_bh-L and M_bh-M_sph relations observed at high
masses may have instead largely arisen from the additive dry merging of
galaxies. We argue that feedback results in a dramatically different scaling
relation, such that black hole mass scales roughly quadratically with the
spheroid mass in Sersic galaxies. We therefore introduce a revised cold-gas
'quasar' mode feeding equation for semi-analytical models to reflect what we
dub the ""quadratic growth"" of black holes in Sersic galaxies built amidst
gas-rich processes. Finally, we use our new Sersic M_bh-L equations to predict
the masses of candidate `intermediate mass' black holes in almost 50 low
luminosity spheroids containing AGN, finding many masses between that of
stellar mass black holes and supermassive black holes.

effects that are important for interpreting future high-resolution SZ data. Our
analysis shows that line-of-sight temperature variations can introduce
significant biases in the derived SZ temperature and peculiar velocity. We
furthermore discuss how the position of the SZ null is affected by the
cluster's temperature and velocity structure. Our computations indicate that
the SZ signal around the null alone is rather insensitive to different cluster
models and that high frequency channels add a large leverage in this respect.

many properties in common, the broad emission lines (BELs) are exclusively
signatures of the AGN. Based on the detection of these lines from SDSS data
bases, there seems to be no AGN with mass M_BH \lesssim 10^5 M_sun. In this
paper we investigate if such low mass black holes are really non-existent or
they are undetected because the BELs in them are not produced efficiently.
Using the ionizing spectral energy distribution for a wide range of black hole
mass, 10 - 10^9 M_sun, spanning XRBs to AGN, we calculate the equivalent widths
(EWs) of ultraviolet and optical lines Ly\alpha 1216 \AA, H\beta 4861 \AA, CIV
1549 \AA and MgII 2798 \AA. The LOC (locally optimally emitting cloud) model
has been used to describe the broad emission line region (BELR) for the
calculations. We find that the hardening of the SED shape with decreasing mass
do not decrease the BEL EWs. However, finite size of the BELR, as measured by
the line widths, which is controlled by the mass of the black hole, regulates
the production of these emission lines. There seems to be a peak in the EWs of
the emission lines for typical AGN black holes of ~ 10^8 M_sun, below which the
lines become intrinsically fainter with a sharp fall-off below ~ 10^6 M_sun.
This may be the cause of the absence of low mass AGN in SDSS.

compare two methods in the source-space causality analysis: the conventional
least-squares method and a sparse Bayesian method. Results of our computer
experiments show that the interference affects the least-squares method in a
very severe manner. It produces large false-positive results, unless the
signal-to-interference ratio is very high. On the other hand, the sparse
Bayesian method is relatively insensitive to the existence of interference.
However, this robustness of the sparse Bayesian method is attained on the
scarifies of the detectability of true causal relationship. Our experiments
also show that the surrogate data bootstrapping method tends to give a
statistical threshold that are too low for the sparse method.
  The permutation-test-based method gives a higher (more conservative)
threshold and it should be used with the sparse Bayesian method whenever the
control period is available.

distributed system consists of one coordinator node that is connected to $k$

coordinator. At each time-step $t$, one of the $k$ site nodes has to pick an
expert from the set ${1, ..., n}$, and the same site receives information about
payoffs of all experts for that round. The goal of the distributed system is to
minimize regret at time horizon $T$, while simultaneously keeping communication
to a minimum.
  The two extreme solutions to this problem are: (i) Full communication: This
essentially simulates the non-distributed setting to obtain the optimal
$O(\sqrt{\log(n)T})$ regret bound at the cost of $T$ communication. (ii) No
communication: Each site runs an independent copy : the regret is
$O(\sqrt{log(n)kT})$ and the communication is 0. This paper shows the
difficulty of simultaneously achieving regret asymptotically better than
$\sqrt{kT}$ and communication better than $T$. We give a novel algorithm that
for an oblivious adversary achieves a non-trivial trade-off: regret
$O(\sqrt{k^{5(1+\epsilon)/6} T})$ and communication $O(T/k^{\epsilon})$, for
any value of $\epsilon \in (0, 1/5)$. We also consider a variant of the model,
where the coordinator picks the expert. In this model, we show that the
label-efficient forecaster of Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2005) already gives us

address the electron correlation problem in many-electron systems. The central
strategy presented in this method is to perform transformation on the
electronic Hamiltonian for approximate removal of the Coulomb singularity. The
principle difference between the present method and the transcorrelated method
of Handy and Boys is that the congruent transformation preserves the Hermitian
property of the Hamiltonian. The congruent transformation is carried out using
explicitly correlated functions and the optimum correlated transform
Hamiltonian is obtained by performing a search over a set of transformation
functions. The ansatz of the transformation functions are selected to
facilitate analytical evaluation of all the resulting integrals. The ground
state energy is obtained variationally by performing a full configuration
interaction (FCI) calculation on the congruent transformed Hamiltonian.
Computed results on well-studied benchmark systems show that for the identical
basis functions, the energy from the congruent transformed Hamiltonian is
significantly lower than the conventional FCI calculations. Since the number of
configuration state functions in the FCI calculation increases rapidly with the
size of the 1-particle basis set, the results indicate that the congruent
transformed Hamiltonian provides a viable alternative to obtain FCI quality
energy using a smaller underlying 1-particle basis set.

difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a unified method -
coordinate-independent sparse estimation (CISE) - that can simultaneously

explain the DAMA, CoGeNT and CRESST-II data. Both of these approaches feature
spin independent elastic scattering of dark matter particles on nuclei. Light
WIMP dark matter invokes a single particle species which interacts with
ordinary matter via contact interactions. By contrast hidden sector dark matter
is typically multi-component and is assumed to interact via the exchange of a
massless mediator. Such hidden sector dark matter thereby predicts a sharply
rising nuclear recoil spectrum, $dR/dE_R \sim 1/E_R^2$ due to this dynamics,
while WIMP dark matter predicts a spectrum which depends sensitively on the
WIMP mass, $m_\chi$. We compare and contrast these two very different possible
origins of the CoGeNT low energy excess. In the relevant energy range, the
recoil spectra predicted by these two theories approximately agree provided
$m_\chi \simeq 8.5$ GeV - close to the value favoured from fits to the CoGeNT
and CDMS low energy data. Forthcoming experiments including C-4, CDEX, and the
MAJORANA demonstrator, are expected to provide reasonably precise measurements
of the low energy Germanium recoil spectrum, including the annual modulation
amplitude, which should differentiate between these two theoretical
possibilities.

generalized solutions of nonsmooth convex foliation systems, recovering a
hidden regularity after reparameterization, as consequence of our main result.

errors on the top quark mass and from higher order corrections. In this
dangerous region, for fixed CMSSM parameters the neutralino lightest
supersymmetric particle mass has an associated large uncertainty of order 100%.
These uncertainties therefore have a profound effect on the interpretation of
LHC supersymmetric particle searches in terms of the CMSSM. We also show how to
ameliorate poor convergence of the iterative numerical algorithm that
calculates the MSSM spectrum near the boundary of EWSB.

  indoor environment",,,,,"cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, we consider the use of seismic sensors for footstep
localization in indoor environments. A popular strategy of localization is to
use the measured differences in arrival times of source signals at multiple
pairs of receivers. In the literature, most algorithms that are based on time
differences of arrival (TDOA) assume that the propagation velocity is a
constant as a function of the source position, which is valid for air
propagation or even for narrow band signals. However a bounded medium such as a
concrete slab (encountered in indoor environement) is usually dispersive and
damped. In this study, we demonstrate that under such conditions, the concrete
slab can be assimilated to a thin plate; considering a Kelvin-Voigt damping
model, we introduce the notion of {\em perceived propagation velocity}, which
decreases when the source-sensor distance increases. This peculiar behaviour
precludes any possibility to rely on existing localization methods in indoor
environment. Therefore, a new localization algorithm that is adapted to a
damped and dispersive medium is proposed, using only on the sign of the
measured TDOA (SO-TDOA). A simulation and some experimental results are
included, to define the performance of this SO-TDOA algorithm.

pattern with alternating prograde and retrograde direction. While the main
equatorial band is prograde on the gas giants, both ice giants have a
pronounced retrograde equatorial jet.
  We use three-dimensional numerical models of compressible convection in
rotating spherical shells to explore the properties of zonal flows in different
regimes where either rotation or buoyancy dominates the force balance. We
conduct a systematic parameter study to quantify the dependence of zonal flows
on the background density stratification and the driving of convection.
  We find that the direction of the equatorial zonal wind is controlled by the
ratio of buoyancy and Coriolis force. The prograde equatorial band maintained
by Reynolds stresses is found in the rotation-dominated regime. In cases where
buoyancy dominates Coriolis force, the angular momentum per unit mass is
homogenised and the equatorial band is retrograde, reminiscent to those
observed in the ice giants. In this regime, the amplitude of the zonal jets
depends on the background density contrast with strongly stratified models
producing stronger jets than comparable weakly stratified cases. Furthermore,
our results can help to explain the transition between solar-like and
""anti-solar"" differential rotations found in anelastic models of stellar
convection zones.
  In the strongly stratified cases, we find that the leading order force
balance can significantly vary with depth (rotation-dominated inside and
buoyancy-dominated in a thin surface layer). This so-called ""transitional
regime"" has a visible signature in the main equatorial jet which shows a
pronounced dimple where flow amplitudes notably decay towards the equator. A
similar dimple is observed on Jupiter, which suggests that convection in the

the electron are two different points was stated 100 years ago, our conceptual
ideas about elementary particles would be different. This assumption is only
compatible with a relativistic description. It suggests, from the classical
point of view, that the angular momentum of the electron has to have a unique
value. In the free motion, the CC follows a helix at the speed of light. The
spin with respect to CC and to CM satisfy two different dynamical equations
which shows that Dirac spin operator in the quantum case satisfies the same
dynamical equation as the classical spin with respect to the CC. This means,
among other things, that the addition of the three Dirac's spin operators of
the three quarks can never give rise to the spin of the proton, so that the
proton spin crisis could be related to this incompleteness in the addition of
the quark's angular momenta. Some other effects related to spinning particles
like the concept of gyromagnetic ratio, a classical description of tunneling
and the formation of bound pairs of electrons, are analized.

Ginzburg-Landau (G-L) theory. Although the functional form of Jc for
superconducting-normal-superconducting (SNS) Josephson-Junctions (J-Js) is
known in the low field limit, includes the local properties of the junctions
and has been confirmed experimentally in many systems, there are no general
solutions for Jc of J-Js in high fields. Scaling laws describe the functional
form (magnetic field, temperature and strain dependence) of Jc for
polycrystalline superconductors in high fields but do not include local grain
boundary properties. They are derived by considering isolated pinning sites
where at criticality fluxons either depin or free fluxons shear past pinned
fluxons as part of the flux line lattice. However, visualisation of solutions
to the Time Dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equations for polycrystalline
materials have shown that fluxons cross the superconductor by flowing along the
grain boundaries. Here we derive clean- and dirty- limit analytic equations for
of SNS J-Js in high fields and verify them using computational solutions to
TDGL theory. We consider SNS J-Js to be the basic building blocks for grain
boundaries in polycrystalline materials since they provide flux-flow channels.
The J-Js description provides a mathematical framework that includes the
utility of scaling laws together with our microscopic understanding of barriers

improve in low temperature polycrystalline superconductors used in high

$U$. Then one can define the ""perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles"" $PV_{U,f}$, a
perverse sheaf on $X$.
  This paper proves four main results:
  (a) Suppose $\Phi:U\to U$ is an isomorphism with $f\circ\Phi=f$ and
$\Phi\vert_X=$id$_X$. Then $\Phi$ induces an isomorphism $\Phi_*:PV_{U,f}\to
PV_{U,f}$. We show that $\Phi_*$ is multiplication by det$(d\Phi\vert_X)=1$ or
$-1$.
  (b) $PV_{U,f}$ depends up to canonical isomorphism only on $X^{(3)},f^{(3)}$,
for $X^{(3)}$ the third-order thickening of $X$ in $U$, and
$f^{(3)}=f\vert_{X^{(3)}}:X^{(3)}\to\mathbb A^1$.
  (c) If $U,V$ are smooth $\mathbb C$-schemes, $f:U\to\mathbb A^1$,
$g:V\to\mathbb A^1$ are regular, $X=$Crit$(f)$, $Y=$Crit$(g)$, and $\Phi:U\to
V$ is an embedding with $f=g\circ\Phi$ and $\Phi\vert_X:X\to Y$ an isomorphism,
there is a natural isomorphism
$\Theta_\Phi:PV_{U,f}\to\Phi\vert_X^*(PV_{V,g})\otimes_{\mathbb Z_2}P_\Phi$,
for $P_\Phi$ a natural principal $\mathbb Z_2$-bundle on $X$.
  (d) If $(X,s)$ is an oriented d-critical locus in the sense of Joyce
arXiv:1304.4508, there is a natural perverse sheaf $P_{X,s}$ on $X$, such that
if $(X,s)$ is locally modelled on Crit$(f:U\to\mathbb A^1)$ then $P_{X,s}$ is
locally modelled on $PV_{U,f}$.
  We also generalize our results to replace $U,X$ by complex analytic spaces,
and $PV_{U,f}$ by $\mathcal D$-modules, or mixed Hodge modules. We discuss
applications of (d) to categorifying Donaldson-Thomas invariants of Calabi-Yau
3-folds, and to defining a 'Fukaya category' of Lagrangians in a complex

snowpack EBM based on radiative transfer theory, previously used for C-band
applications, is adapted for the X-band. From measured or simulated snowpack
stratigraphic profiles consisting of snow optical grain radius and density,
this forward model calculates the backscattering coefficient for different
polarimetric channels. The output result is then compared with spaceborne
TerraSAR-X acquisitions to evaluate the forward model. Next, from the EBM, the
adjoint operator is developed and used in a variational analysis scheme in
order to minimize the discrepancies between simulations and SAR observations. A
time series of TerraSAR-X acquisitions and in-situ measurements on the
Argenti\`ere glacier (Mont-Blanc massif, French Alps) are used to evaluate the
EBM and the data assimilation scheme. Results indicate that snow stratigraphic

the inner edge of the disk. Our observations also detect an elongated arc (50
AU) extending over the disk inner hole. It emanates at the inner edge of the

relativistic LB model. Through the Chapman-Enskog analysis, it is shown that in
the relativistic LB model the conservation equation of particle number is a
convection-diffusion equation rather than a continuity equation, which makes
the evolution of particle number dependent on the relaxation time. Furthermore,
we investigate the origin of the discontinuities appeared in the relativistic
problems with high viscosities, which were reported in a recent study [D. Hupp
et al., Phys. Rev. D 84, 125015 (2011)]. A multiple-relaxation-time (MRT)
relativistic LB model is presented to examine the influences of different
relaxation times on the discontinuities. Numerical experiments show the
discontinuities can be eliminated by setting the relaxation time $\tau_e$
(related to the bulk viscosity) to be sufficiently smaller than the relaxation
time $\tau_v$ (related to the shear viscosity). Meanwhile, it is found that the
relaxation time $\tau_\varepsilon$, which has no effect on the conservation
equations at the Navier-Stokes level, will affect the numerical accuracy of the

investigated by means of MD simulations. This is motivated by recent
experimental findings [Passerini et al., Electrochim. Acta 2012, 86, 330-338],
which demonstrated that these materials display an enhanced lithium mobility
relative to their binary counterpart PEO/LiTFSI. In order to grasp the
underlying microscopic scenario giving rise to these observations, we employ an
analytical, Rouse-based cation transport model [Maitra at al., PRL 2007, 98,
227802], which has originally been devised for conventional polymer
electrolytes. This model describes the cation transport via three different
mechanisms, each characterized by an individual time scale. It turns out that
also in the ternary electrolytes essentially all lithium ions are coordinated
by PEO chains, thus ruling out a transport mechanism enhanced by the presence
of ionic-liquid molecules. Rather, the plasticizing effect of the ionic liquid
contributes to the increased lithium mobility by enhancing the dynamics of the
PEO chains and consequently also the motion of the attached ions. Additional
focus is laid on the prediction of lithium diffusion coefficients from the
simulation data for various chain lengths and the comparison with experimental
data, thus demonstrating the broad applicability of our approach.

dynamics of a short polymer chain under melt conditions. In this contribution,
we explicitly check one of the fundamental assumptions of this model, namely
that of a uniform friction coefficient for all monomers, on the basis of MD
simulation data of a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) melt. This question immediately
arises from the fact that in a real polymer melt the terminal monomers have on
average more intermolecular neighbors than the central monomers, and one would
expect that exactly these details affect the precise value of the friction
coefficient. The mobilities are determined by our recently developed
statistical method, which provides detailed insights about the local polymer
dynamics. Moreover, it yields complementary information to that obtained from
the mean square displacement (MSD) or the Rouse mode analysis. It turns out
that the Rouse assumption of a uniform mobility is fulfilled to a good
approximation for the PEO melt. However, a more detailed analysis reveals that
the underlying microscopic dynamics is highly affected by different
contributions from intra- and intermolecular excluded volume interactions,
which cannot be taken into account by a modified friction coefficient. Minor
deviations occur only for the terminal monomers on larger time scales, which
can be attributed to the presence of two different escape mechanisms from their
first coordination sphere. These effects remain elusive when studying the
dynamics with the MSD only.

evolution with Principal Component Analysis followed by subsequent spectral
fits to the time-averaged spectra (~ 3 ks). Based on the analysis we find that
the overall X-ray variability during major flaring episodes can be attributed
to two principal components whose evolution based on spectral fits is best
reproduced by a hybrid Comptonization component and a bremsstrahlung or
saturated thermal Comptonization component. The variability of the thermal
component is found to be linked to the change in the X-ray/radio spectral
state. In addition, we find that the seed photons for the Comptonization
originate in two seed photon populations that include the additional thermal
emission and emission from the accretion disc. The Comptonization of the
photons from the thermal component dominates, at least during the major radio
flare episode in question, and the Comptonization of disc photons is
intermittent and can be attributed to the phase interval 0.2-0.4. The most
likely location for Comptonization is in the shocks in the jet.

countries, which indeed is intrinsic to any collection of individual groups or
other social aggregations. Coalitions among countries are formed by the
respective attraction or repulsion caused by the historical bond propensities
between the countries, which produced an intricate circuit of bilateral bonds.
Contradictory associations into coalitions occur due to the independent
evolution of the bonds. Those coalitions tend to be unstable and break down
frequently. The model extends some features of the physical theory of Spin
Glasses. Within the frame of this model, the instability is viewed as a
consequence of decentralized maximization processes searching for the best
coalition allocations. In contrast to the existing literature, a rational
instability is found to result from forecast rationality of countries. Using a
general theoretical framework allowing to analyze the countries' decision
making in coalition forming, we feature a system where stability can eventually
be achieved as a result of the maximization processes. We provide a formal
implementation of the maximization principles and illustrate it in the
multi-thread simulation of the coalition forming. The results shed a new light
on the prospect of searches for the best coalition allocations in the networks

introduces biases, at least in the projected velocity Vsin(i) compared to the

the rotational broadening on the subplanet profile into account. We compare our
formulas adapted to the CCF technique with simulated data generated with the

Shaffer and Hochberg, parallel and serial gatekeeping procedures, modern
procedures for multiple testing in graphs, resampling-based multiple testing
procedures and even the closed testing and partitioning procedures themselves.
We also give a general proof that sequentially rejective multiple testing
procedures strongly control the familywise error if they fulfill simple
criteria of monotonicity of the critical values and a limited form of weak
familywise error control in each single step. The sequential rejection
principle gives a novel theoretical perspective on many well-known multiple
testing procedures, emphasizing the sequential aspect. Its main practical
usefulness is for the development of multiple testing procedures for null
hypotheses, possibly logically related, that are structured in a graph. We
illustrate this by presenting a uniform improvement of a recently published
procedure.

to the thin film surface, minimizing the influence of vortices. The magnetic
field disrupts the time-reversal symmetry of the pairs, giving them a finite
lifetime and decreasing the energy gap. The field could also polarize the
quasiparticle spins, producing different populations of spin-up and spin-down

conclude that strong spin-orbit scattering reduces the spin polarization,
leaving the field-induced gap reduction as the dominant effect and accounting

formation. Contributions from dust heated by young stars are separated by
identifying HII regions in the Ha map and using these areas as a mask to
determine the 8um dust emission that must be due to heating by older stars.
Corrections are made for sub-detection-threshold HII regions, photons escaping
from HII regions and for young stars not directly associated to HII regions
(i.e. 10-100 Myr old stars). A simple model confirms this amount of 8um
emission can be expected given dust and PAH absorption cross-sections, a
realistic star-formation history, and the observed optical extinction values. A
Fourier power spectrum analysis indicates that the 8um dust emission is more
diffuse than the Ha emission (and similar to observed HI), supporting our
analysis that much of the 8um-emitting dust is heated by older stars. The 8um
dust-to-Ha emission ratio declines with galactocentric radius both within and
outside of HII regions, probably due to a radial increase in disk transparency.
In the course of this work, we have also found that intrinsic diffuse Ha
fractions may be lower than previously thought in galaxies, if the differential
extinction between HII regions and diffuse regions is taken into account.

properties of the medium created in relativistic heavy ion collisions. Evidence
for this energy loss was first experimentally established through observation
of high-p_T hadron suppression at RHIC. More recently, measurements of fully
reconstructed jets have been performed at the LHC. In this summary the latest
experimental results from the ATLAS collaboration on jet suppression are
presented. In particular the jet suppression in inclusive jet yields, path
length dependence of the jet suppression, photon-jet and Z^0-jet correlations,
heavy flavor suppression, and jet fragmentation are discussed. These results
establish qualitative features of the jet quenching mechanism as experimental
fact and provide constraints on models of jet energy loss.

reacceleration by turbulence in cluster mergers. We use an idealised model for
cluster mergers, combined with a numerical model for the injection, cooling and
reacceleration of cosmic-ray electrons, to investigate the evolution of cluster
scale radio emission in these objects. In line with theoretical expectations,
we for the first time, show in a simulation that reacceleration of CRe has the
potential to reproduce key observables of radio halos. In particular, we show
that clusters evolve being radio loud or radio quiet, depending on their
evolutionary stage during the merger. We thus recover the observed transient
nature of radio halos. In the simulation the diffuse emission traces the
complex interplay between spatial distribution of turbulence injected by the
halo infall and the spatial distribution of the seed electrons to reaccelerate.
During the formation and evolution of the halo the synchrotron emission spectra
show the observed variety: from power-laws with spectral index of 1 to 1.3 to
curved and ultra-steep spectra with index $> 1.5$.

Ahmed and Jennifer Neville and Ramana Kompella","Network Sampling: From Static to Streaming Graphs",,,,,"cs.SI cs.DS cs.LG physics.soc-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network sampling is integral to the analysis of social, information, and
biological networks. Since many real-world networks are massive in size,
continuously evolving, and/or distributed in nature, the network structure is
often sampled in order to facilitate study. For these reasons, a more thorough
and complete understanding of network sampling is critical to support the field
of network science. In this paper, we outline a framework for the general
problem of network sampling, by highlighting the different objectives,
population and units of interest, and classes of network sampling methods. In
addition, we propose a spectrum of computational models for network sampling
methods, ranging from the traditionally studied model based on the assumption
of a static domain to a more challenging model that is appropriate for
streaming domains. We design a family of sampling methods based on the concept
of graph induction that generalize across the full spectrum of computational
models (from static to streaming) while efficiently preserving many of the
topological properties of the input graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
traditional static sampling algorithms can be modified for graph streams for
each of the three main classes of sampling methods: node, edge, and
topology-based sampling. Our experimental results indicate that our proposed
family of sampling methods more accurately preserves the underlying properties
of the graph for both static and streaming graphs. Finally, we study the impact
of network sampling algorithms on the parameter estimation and performance
evaluation of relational classification algorithms.

  Polymer Electrolytes - The Critical Role of the Segmental Mobility","19 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulation study of the
lithium ion transport in ternary polymer electrolytes consisting of
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), lithium-bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI)
and the ionic liquid N-methyl-N-propylpyrrolidinium
bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (PYR13TFSI). In particular, we focus on two
different strategies by which the ternary electrolytes can be devised, namely
by (a) adding the ionic liquid to PEO20LiTFSI, and (b) substituting the PEO
chains in PEO20LiTFSI by the ionic liquid. In order to grasp the changes of the
overall lithium transport mechanism, we employ an analytical, Rouse-based
cation transport model (Maitra et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 2007, 98, 227802),
which has originally been devised for binary PEO-based electrolytes. This model
distinguishes three different microscopic transport mechanisms, each quantified
by an individual time scale. In the course of our analysis, we extend this
mathematical description to account for an entirely new transport mechanism,
namely the TFSI-supported diffusion of lithium ions decoupled from the PEO
chains, which emerges for certain stoichiometries. We find that the segmental
mobility plays a decisive role in PEO-based polymer electrolytes. That is,
whereas the addition of the ionic liquid to PEO20LiTFSI plasticizes the polymer
network and thus also increases the lithium diffusion, the amount of free,
mobile ether oxygens reduces when substituting the PEO chains by the ionic
liquid, which compensates the plasticizing effect. In total, our observations
allow us to formulate some general principles about the lithium ion transport
mechanism in ternary polymer electrolytes. Moreover, our insights also shed
light on recent experimental observations (Joost et al., Electrochim. Acta,
2012, 86, 330).

popular methods for simulating composite materials and flows in porous media
which may have many scales. But the method may be inapplicable or inefficient
in some portions of the computational domain, e.g., near the domain boundary or
near long narrow channels inside the domain due to the lack of permeability
information outside of the domain or the fact that the high-conductivity
features cannot be localized within a coarse-grid block. In this paper we
develop a combined finite element and multiscale finite element method
(FE-MsFEM), which deals with such portions by using the standard finite element
method on a fine mesh and the other portions by the oversampling MsFEM. The
transmission conditions across the FE-MSFE interface is treated by the penalty
technique. A rigorous convergence analysis for this special FE-MsFEM is given
under the assumption that the diffusion coefficient is periodic. Numerical
experiments are carried out for the elliptic equations with periodic and random
highly oscillating coefficients, as well as multiscale problems with high
contrast channels, to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed
method.
