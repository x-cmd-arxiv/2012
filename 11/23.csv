automated unsupervised classification of massive stellar spectral catalogs. The
classification criteria are defined by the data and the algorithm, with no
prior physical framework. We work with a representative set of stellar spectra
associated with the SDSS SEGUE and SEGUE-2 programs. We classify the original
spectra as well as the spectra with the continuum removed. The second set only
contains spectral lines, and it is less dependent on uncertainties of the flux
calibration. The classification of the spectra with continuum renders 16 major
classes. Roughly speaking, stars are split according to their colors, with
enough finesse to distinguish dwarfs from giants of the same effective
temperature, but with difficulties to separate stars with different
metallicities. Overall, there is no one-to-one correspondence between the
classes we derive and the MK types. The classification of spectra without
continuum renders 13 classes, the color separation is not so sharp, but it
distinguishes stars of the same effective temperature and different
metallicities. Some classes thus obtained present a fairly small range of
physical parameters (200 K in effective temperature, 0.25 dex in surface
gravity, and 0.35 dex in metallicity), so that the classification can be used
to estimate the main physical parameters of some stars at a minimum
computational cost. We also analyze the outliers of the classification. Most of
them turn out to be failures of the reduction pipeline, but there are also high
redshift QSOs, multiple stellar systems, dust-reddened stars, galaxies, and,
finally, odd spectra whose nature we have not decipher. The template spectra
representative of the classes are publicly available
(ftp://stars:kmeans@ftp.iac.es).

as the Laing-Garrington (L-G) effect where more rapid depolarization is seen in
the lobe with no visible jet as the wavelength increases, can be explained
either by internal differences between the two lobes, or by an external Faraday
screen that lies in front of only the depolarized lobe. If the jet
one-sidedness is due to relativistic beaming the depolarization asymmetry must
be due to an intervening Faraday screen. If it is intrinsic the depolarization
asymmetry must be related to internal differences in the lobes. We assume in
this paper that the speed in the outer jet of several Fanaroff-Riley Class 1
(FRI) sources exhibiting the L-G effect is close to the 0.1c reported by
several other investigators. For these sources we find that the jet
one-sidedness cannot be explained by beaming and therefore must be intrinsic.
In these FRI sources the L-G effect must be due to differences that originate
inside the lobes themselves. Although it is not known if the flow in the outer
jets of FRII sources also slows to this speed it is suggested that the
explanation of the L-G effect is likely to be the same in both types. This
argument is strengthened by the recent evidence that FRII galaxies have very
large viewing angles, which in turn implies that the L-G model cannot work
regardless of the jet velocity. It may therefore be too soon to completely rule
out internal depolarization in the lobes as the true explanation for the L-G
effect.

and have thereby underlined the difficulties in large-scale magnetic field
generation in this regime. Here we consider kinematic dynamo processes in a
rotating convective layer of Boussinesq fluid with the additional influence of
a large-scale horizontal velocity shear. Incorporating the shear flow enhances
the dynamo growth rate and also leads to the generation of significant magnetic
fields on large scales. By the technique of spectral filtering, we analyse the
modes in the velocity that are principally responsible for dynamo action, and
show that the magnetic field resulting from the full flow relies crucially on a
range of scales in the velocity field. Filtering the flow to provide a true
separation of scales between the shear and the convective flow also leads to
dynamo action; however, the magnetic field in this case has a very different
structure from that generated by the full velocity field. We also show that the
nature of the dynamo action is broadly similar irrespective of whether the flow
in the absence of shear can support dynamo action.

(ICMEs) where a magnetic flux rope is detected. Is the difference between MCs
and ICMEs without detected flux rope intrinsic or rather due to an
observational bias? As the spacecraft has no relationship with the MC
trajectory, the frequency distribution of MCs versus the spacecraft distance to
the MCs axis is expected to be approximately flat. However, Lepping and Wu
(2010) confirmed that it is a strongly decreasing function of the estimated
impact parameter. Is a flux rope more frequently undetected for larger impact
parameter? In order to answer the questions above, we explore the parameter
space of flux rope models, especially the aspect ratio, boundary shape, and
current distribution. The proposed models are analyzed as MCs by fitting a
circular linear force-free field to the magnetic field computed along simulated
crossings.
  We find that the distribution of the twist within the flux rope, the
non-detection due to too low field rotation angle or magnitude are only weakly
affecting the expected frequency distribution of MCs versus impact parameter.
However, the estimated impact parameter is increasingly biased to lower values
as the flux-rope cross section is more elongated orthogonally to the crossing
trajectory. The observed distribution of MCs is a natural consequence of a
flux-rope cross section flattened in average by a factor 2 to 3 depending on
the magnetic twist profile. However, the faster MCs at 1 AU, with V>550 km/s,
present an almost uniform distribution of MCs vs. impact parameter, which is
consistent with round shaped flux ropes, in contrast with the slower ones. We
conclude that either most of the non-MC ICMEs are encountered outside their
flux rope or near the leg region, or they do not contain any.

of Cobb angle, which appreciably reduces the variability related to its

facilitated by using a suitable new improved version of Non-Local Means for
image denoisation and Otsus automatic threshold selection for Canny edge

the fine states of art for image denoisation and helps in retaining the image
quality. Trimmedmean, median are more robust to outliners than mean and
following this concept we observed that NLM denoising quality performance can
be enhanced by using Euclidean trimmed-mean replacing the mean. To prove the
better performance of the Non-Local Euclidean Trimmed-mean denoising filter, we
have provided some comparative study results of the proposed denoising
technique with traditional NLM and NonLocal Euclidean Medians. The experimental
results for Cobb angle measurement over intra observer and inter observer

binaries are frequently interpreted as being caused by circumbinary giant
planets. This interpretation raises the question of the origin of the potential
planets that must have either formed in the primordial circumbinary disk,
together with the host binary star, and survived its evolution into a
close-compact binary or formed in a post-common-envelope circumbinary disk that
remained bound to the post-common-envelope binary (PCEB). Here we combine
current knowledge of planet formation and the statistics of giant planets
around primordial and evolved binary stars with the theory of close-compact
binary star evolution aiming to derive new constraints on possible formation
scenarios. We compiled a comprehensive list of observed eclipsing PCEBs,
estimated the fraction of systems showing apparent period variations,
reconstructed the evolutionary history of the PCEBs, and performed binary
population models of PCEBs to characterize their main sequence binary
progenitors. We reviewed the currently available constraints on the fraction of
PCEB progenitors that host circumbinary giant planets. We find that the
progenitors of PCEBs are very unlikely to be frequent hosts of giant planets
(<~10 per cent), while the frequency of PCEBs with observed apparent period
variations is very high (~90 per cent). The variations in eclipse timings
measured in eclipsing PCEBs are probably not caused by first-generation planets
that survived common-envelope evolution. The remaining options for explaining
the observed period variations are second-generation planet formation or
perhaps variations in the shape of a magnetically active secondary star. We
suggest observational tests for both options.

source that may be an alternative to conventional x-ray sources, based on large
scale machines. In addition to its potential as a source, precise measurements
of betatron emission can reveal crucial information about relativistic
laser-plasma interaction. We show that the emission length and the position of

the measurement of the longitudinal extension helps one to determine whether
the acceleration is limited by pump depletion or dephasing effects. In the case
of multiple injections, it is used to retrieve unambiguously the position in
the plasma of each injection. This technique is also used to study how, in a
capillary discharge, the variations of the delay between the discharge and the
laser pulse affect the interaction. The study reveals that, for a delay
appropriate for laser guiding, the x-ray emission only occurs in the second
half of the capillary: no electrons are injected and accelerated in the first
half.

intertrade durations (such as heavy tails and long memory) can have a strong

heavy band does not shift rigidly with the chemical potential. Intriguingly, we
find that the actual shift is determined by the interplay of heavy and
additional light bands crossing the Fermi level: doped carriers tend to
populate heavy and light bands equally, despite the fact that the latter
contribute a small density of states of excitations only. This invalidates
naive estimates of the transition shift based on the low-temperature specific
heat of the heavy Fermi liquid. We discuss applications of our results.

hole-host relations to populate merging galaxies with SMBHs. The result of our
procedure is a collection of a large number of phenomenological SMBH binary
merger rates consistent with current observational constraints on the galaxy
assembly at z<1.5. For each merger rate we compute the associated GW signal,
eventually producing a large set of estimates of the nHz GW background that we
use to infer confidence intervals of its expected amplitude. When considering
the most recent SMBH-host relations, accounting for ultra-massive black holes
in brightest cluster galaxies, we find that the nominal $1\sigma$ interval of
the expected GW signal is only a factor of 3-to-10 below current PTA limits,
implying a non negligible chance of detection in the next few years.

estimates for pulsar timing arrays, with an expectation value for the

black-hole binaries. We test and confirm their empirical relationship using a
fifth source, H1743-322, whose spin was recently measured. We show that this

information at the transmitters (CSIT) over the feasibility of interference
alignment (IA) in a K-user MIMO interference channel (IC). Incompleteness of
CSIT refers to the perfect knowledge at each transmitter (TX) of only a
sub-matrix of the global channel matrix, where the sub-matrix is specific to
each TX. This paper investigates the notion of IA feasibility for CSIT
configurations being as incomplete as possible, as this leads to feedback
overhead reductions in practice. We distinguish between antenna configurations
where (i) removing a single antenna makes IA unfeasible, referred to as
tightly-feasible settings, and (ii) cases where extra antennas are available,
referred to as super-feasible settings. We show conditions for which IA is
feasible in strictly incomplete CSIT scenarios, even in tightly-feasible
settings. For such cases, we provide a CSIT allocation policy preserving IA
feasibility while reducing significantly the amount of CSIT required. For
super-feasible settings, we develop a heuristic CSIT allocation algorithm which
exploits the additional antennas to further reduce the size of the CSIT
allocation. As a byproduct of our approach, a simple and intuitive algorithm

present the versions with the QTT approximation. We also present an efficient
formula for the shift of vectors given in QTT format, which is used in the

Fourier transform, i.e., $O(\log^2 n).$ The results of the paper are
illustrated by numerical examples.

recently shown that the set of twisted involutions (i.e., elements $w \in W$

(CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) is employed to investigate the
properties of Tycho's SNR and their correspondence to the existing experimental
data, taking into account that the ambient interstellar medium (ISM) is
expected to be clumpy. It is demonstrated that the overall steep gamma-ray
spectrum observed can be interpreted as the superposition of two spectra
produced by the CR proton component in two different ISM phases: The first
gamma-ray component, extending up to about $10^{14}$ eV, originates in the
diluted warm ISM, whereas the second component, extending up to 100 GeV, comes
from numerous dense, small-scale clouds embedded in this warm ISM. Given the
consistency between acceleration theory and the observed properties of the
nonthermal emission of Tycho's SNR, a very efficient production of nuclear CRs
in Tycho's SNR is established. The excess of the GeV gamma-ray emission due to
the clouds' contribution above the level expected in the case of a purely
homogeneous ISM, is inevitably expected in the case of type Ia SNe.

spiral arms in disk galaxies, we analyzed the growing and damping phases of
their spiral arms using three-dimensional $N$-body simulations. We confirmed
that the spiral arms are formed due to a swing amplification mechanism that
reinforces density enhancement as a seeded wake. In the damping phase, the
Coriolis force exerted on a portion of the arm surpasses the gravitational
force that acts to shrink the portion. Consequently, the stars in the portion
escape from the arm, and subsequently they form a new arm at a different
location. The time-dependent nature of the spiral arms are originated in the
continual repetition of this non-linear phenomenon. Since a spiral arm does not
rigidly rotate, but follows the galactic differential rotation, the stars in
the arm rotate at almost the same rate as the arm. In other words, every single
position in the arm can be regarded as the co-rotation point. Due to
interaction with their host arms, the energy and angular momentum of the stars
change, thereby causing the radial migration of the stars. During this process,
the kinetic energy of random motion (random energy) of the stars does not
significantly increase, and the disk remains dynamically cold. Owing to this
low degree of disk heating, the short-lived spiral arms can recurrently develop
over many rotational periods. The resultant structure of the spiral arms in the
$N$-body simulations is consistent with some observational nature of spiral
galaxies. We conclude that the formation and structure of spiral arms in
isolated disk galaxies can be reasonably understood by non-linear interactions
between a spiral arm and its constituent stars.

field respects the gauge symmetry and the resulting dynamical equations are of
second order. The action contains only one free parameter, $\lambda$, that
determines the strength of the non-minimal coupling between the gauge field and
gravity. We investigate the cosmological consequences of this action and
discuss observational constraints. For $\lambda<0$ we identify singularities
where the deceleration parameter diverges within a finite proper time. This
effectively rules out any sensible cosmological application of the theory for a

data storage methods from the use of simple data replication to the use of more
powerful erasure codes, which provide the same level of reliability as
replication but at a significantly lower storage cost. In particular, it is
well known that Maximum-Distance-Separable (MDS) codes, such as Reed-Solomon
codes, provide the maximum storage efficiency. While the use of codes for
providing improved reliability in archival storage systems, where the data is
less frequently accessed (or so-called ""cold data""), is well understood, the
role of codes in the storage of more frequently accessed and active ""hot data"",
where latency is the key metric, is less clear.
  In this paper, we study data storage systems based on MDS codes through the
lens of queueing theory, and term this the ""MDS queue."" We analytically
characterize the (average) latency performance of MDS queues, for which we
present insightful scheduling policies that form upper and lower bounds to
performance, and are observed to be quite tight. Extensive simulations are also
provided and used to validate our theoretical analysis. We also employ the
framework of the MDS queue to analyse different methods of performing so-called
degraded reads (reading of partial data) in distributed data storage.

causing such collapse, and trivalent and small divalent ions can both induce
more compact state than a random relaxation state. We found that monovalent,

Following the work of Moncrief, we write down an action for perturbations in

then obtain Hamiltonian equations of motion for metric perturbations, the
particle's coordinates, as well as their canonical momenta. Hamiltonian
equations for the metric-perturbation and their conjugate momenta reduce to
Zerilli-Moncrief and Regge-Wheeler master equations with source terms, which
are gauge invariant, plus auxiliary equations that specify gauge. Hamiltonian
equations for the particle, on the other hand, now include effect of metric
perturbations - with these new terms derived from the same interaction
Hamiltonian that had lead to those well-known source terms. In this way,
space-time geometry and particle motion can be evolved in a self-consistent
manner, in principle in any gauge. However, the point-particle nature of our
source requires regularization, and we outline how the Detweiler-Whiting
approach can be applied. In this approach, a singular field can be obtained
using Hadamard decomposition of the Green's function and the regular field,
which needs to be evolved numerically, is the result of subtracting the
singular field from the total metric perturbation. In principle, any gauge that
has the singular-regular field decomposition is suitable for our
self-consistent scheme. In reality, however, this freedom is only possible if
our singular field has a high enough level of smoothness. In the case of Lorenz
gauge, for each l and m, we have 2 wave equations to evolve gauge invariant

planetary core of mass \mplan=10\me embedded in a near Keplerian background
flow, using a modified shearing box approximation. We employ a nested grid
hydrodynamic code with as many as six nested grids, providing spatial
resolution on the finest grid comparable to the present day diameters of
Neptune and Uranus. We find that a strongly dynamically active flow develops
such that no static envelope can form. The activity is not sensitive to
plausible variations in the rotation curve of the underlying disk. It is
sensitive to the thermodynamic treatment of the gas, as modeled by prescribed
equations of state (either `locally isothermal' or `locally isentropic') and
the temperature of the background disk material. The activity is also sensitive
to the shape and depth of the core's gravitational potential, through its mass
and gravitational softening coefficient. The varying flow pattern gives rise to
large, irregular eruptions of matter from the region around the core which
return matter to the background flow: mass in the envelope at one time may not
be found in the envelope at any later time. The angular momentum of material in
the envelope, relative to the core, varies both in magnitude and in sign on
time scales of days to months near the core and on time scales a few years at
distances comparable to the Hill radius. We show that material entering the
dynamically active environment may suffer intense heating and cooling events
the durations of which are as short as a few hours to a few days. Peak
temperatures in these events range from $T \sim 1000$ K to as high as $T \sim
3-4000$ K, with densities $\rho\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ g/cm$^3$. These time
scales, densities and temperatures span a range consistent with those required
for chondrule formation in the nebular shock model.

  Communications over Fading Channels",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the power allocation of the physical layer and the buffer delay
of the upper application layer in energy harvesting green networks. The total
power required for reliable transmission includes the transmission power and
the circuit power. The harvested power (which is stored in a battery) and the
grid power constitute the power resource. The uncertainty of data generated
from the upper layer, the intermittence of the harvested energy, and the
variation of the fading channel are taken into account and described as
independent Markov processes. In each transmission, the transmitter decides the
transmission rate as well as the allocated power from the battery, and the rest
of the required power will be supplied by the power grid. The objective is to
find an allocation sequence of transmission rate and battery power to minimize
the long-term average buffer delay under the average grid power constraint. A
stochastic optimization problem is formulated accordingly to find such
transmission rate and battery power sequence. Furthermore, the optimization
problem is reformulated as a constrained MDP problem whose policy is a
two-dimensional vector with the transmission rate and the power allocation of
the battery as its elements. We prove that the optimal policy of the
constrained MDP can be obtained by solving the unconstrained MDP. Then we focus
on the analysis of the unconstrained average-cost MDP. The structural
properties of the average optimal policy are derived. Moreover, we discuss the
relations between elements of the two-dimensional policy. Next, based on the
theoretical analysis, the algorithm to find the constrained optimal policy is
presented for the finite state space scenario. In addition, heuristic policies
with low-complexity are given for the general state space. Finally, simulations
are performed under these policies to demonstrate the effectiveness.

infinite intervals is to replace the boundary conditions at infinity by
suitable boundary conditions at a finite point, the so-called truncated
boundary. A truncated boundary allowing for a satisfactory accuracy of the
numerical solution has to be determined by trial and errors and this seems to
be the weakest point of the classical approach. On the other hand, the free
boundary approach overcomes the need for a priori definition of the truncated
boundary. In fact, in a free boundary formulation the unknown free boundary can
be identified with a truncated boundary and being unknown it has to be found as
part of the solution. In this paper we consider a different way to overcome the
introduction of a truncated boundary, namely finite differences schemes defined
on quasi-uniform grids. A quasi-uniform grid allows us to describe the infinite
domain by a finite number of intervals. The last node of such grid is placed on
infinity so right boundary conditions are taken into account exactly. We apply
the proposed approach to the Falkner-Skan model and to a problem of interest in

formation than chemical disorder. The optical conductivity shows a low-energy
tail below the pristine GAL band gap due to disorder-introduced transitions.

causality violating solutions. The most striking one is the Gott spacetime. Two

timelike curves. It was quickly recognized that this solution violates physical
boundary conditions. The effective one particle generator becomes hyperbolic,
so the center of mass is tachyonic. On a 5-dimensional warped spacetime, it
seems possible to get an elliptic generator, so no obstruction is encountered
and the velocity of the center of mass of the effective particle has an overlap
with the Gott region. So a CTC could, in principle, be constructed. However,
from the effective 4D field equations on the brane, which are influenced by the

the zero vector), where addition is mod 2. We take $n, m \to \infty$, with $m/n

them analytically in terms of the distribution of $W$. Threshold $\alpha^*$
marks the infimum of values of $\alpha$ at which $n^{-1} \log{\mathbb{E}

give $\alpha^* = 0.88949 ...$ and $\underline{\alpha} = 0.91793 ...$ (previous
work on this model has mainly been concerned with such cases where $W$ is
non-random). The threshold of values of $\alpha$ for which $N(n,m) \geq 2$ in
probability lies in $[\alpha^*,\underline{\alpha}]$ and is conjectured to equal
$\underline{\alpha}$.

this we find out that many multiple structures can be smoothed. When we
specialize to the case of double structures we are able to say much more. In
particular, we find numerical conditions, in terms of the degree and the
arithmetic genus, for the existence of many smoothable double structures. Also,
we show that the existence of these double structures is determined, although
not uniquely, by the elements of certain space of vector bundle homomorphisms,

incorporates a dynamic HIV transmission dynamics model to estimate CU time
trends from HIV prevalence data. Estimation is implemented via particle Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods, applied for the first time in this context. The
preliminary choice of the formulation for the time varying parameter reflecting
the proportion of CU is critical in the context studied, due to the very
limited amount of CU and HIV data available We consider various novel
formulations to explore the trajectory of CU in time, based on diffusion-driven
trajectories and smooth sigmoid curves. Extensive series of numerical
simulations indicate that informative results can be obtained regarding the
amplitude of the increase in CU during an intervention, with good levels of
sensitivity and specificity performance in effectively detecting changes. The
application of this method to a real life problem illustrates how it can help
evaluate HIV intervention from few observational studies and suggests that
these methods can potentially be applied in many different contexts.

roughly constant blue shift (upward motions) of 5 km/s in the temperature range

research of Social Networks, Biological Networks etc.. Current researchers have
proposed several measures or algorithms, such as betweenness, PageRank and HITS
etc., to identify the node importance. However, these measures are based on
different aspects of properties of nodes, and often conflict with the others. A
reasonable, fair standard is needed for evaluating and comparing these
algorithms. This paper develops a framework as the standard for ranking the
importance of nodes. Four intuitive rules are suggested to measure the node
importance, and the equivalence classes approach is employed to resolve the
conflicts and aggregate the results of the rules. To quantitatively compare the
algorithms, the performance indicators are also proposed based on a similarity
measure. Three widely used real-world networks are used as the test-beds. The
experimental results illustrate the feasibility of this framework and show that
both algorithms, PageRank and HITS, perform well with bias when dealing with
the tested networks. Furthermore, this paper uses the proposed approach to
analyze the structure of the Internet, and draws out the kernel of the Internet
with dense links.

contrasting their similarities and differences. They are both excellent
examples of serendipitous discoveries in which human curiosity and perseverance
have played an important role. Both objects have captured the imagination of
the general public, and their discovery was only made possible via the
introduction of new technologies. One major difference is that there is only
one Antikythera device but there are now many Voorwerpen or ""voorwerpjes"", as
they are more commonly known. The study of a collection of objects, as is
common in astronomy, greatly aids our understanding of cosmic phenomena. In the
case of the voorwepjes, we now know that such systems are to be identified with
obscured galaxies or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) that appear to have recently
and indeed rapidly turned off. Clearly, the discovery of more examples of
devices similar to the Antikythera mechanism would have a significant affect in
advancing our understanding of this object and the people that constructed it.
Thus far, surveys of the site of the Antikythera wreck are incomplete and
non-systematic. Like radio astronomy and other progressive fields,
technological advances proceed exponentially in terms of capacity and
capability. Recent advances in diving technology are no exception to this rule.
It is almost 40 years ago that Jacques Cousteau led the last adhoc survey of
the Antikythera wreck - the time has surely come to revisit the site and
conduct a proper scientific and systematic survey. The deepest areas of the
site are so far completely unexplored while it is known that some artefacts did
fall into this area during the original excavation. During this workshop, I
called for a return to the site using the most modern diving technologies.

the asymptotic shape of cells with small perimeter is not uniquely determined.
The results are accompanied by a large scale simulation study.

  of Random Strings",,,,"Numerical Analysis Report NA-12-16, Mathematical Institute,
  University of Oxford","math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of determining the correct order of fluctuation of the optimal
alignment score of two random strings of length $n$ has been open for several
decades. It is known that the biased expected effect of a random letter-change
on the optimal score implies an order of fluctuation linear in $\sqrt{n}$.
However, in many situations where such a biased effect is observed empirically,
it has been impossible to prove analytically. The main result of this paper
shows that when the rescaled-limit of the optimal alignment score increases in
a certain direction, then the biased effect exists. On the basis of this result
one can quantify a confidence level for the existence of such a biased effect
and hence of an order $\sqrt{n}$ fluctuation based on simulation of optimal
alignments scores.This is an important step forward, as the correct order of
fluctuation was previously known only for certain special distributions. To
illustrate the usefulness of our new methodology, we apply it to optimal
alignments of strings written in the DNA-alphabet. As scoring function, we use
the BLASTZ default-substitution matrix together with a realistic gap penalty.
BLASTZ is one of the most widely used sequence alignment methodologies in
bioinformatics. For this DNA-setting, we show that with a high level of
confidence, the fluctuation of the optimal alignment score is of order
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$. An important special case of optimal alignment score is the
Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of random strings. For binary sequences with
equiprobable symbols, the question of the fluctuation of the LCS remains open.
The symmetry in that case does not allow for our method. On the other hand, in
real-life DNA sequences, it is not the case that all letters occur with the
same frequency. Thus, for many real life situations, our method allows to
determine the order of the fluctuation up to a high confidence level.

motivated by the observation that affective video indexing has yet to fully
profit from the standard corpora (data sets) that have benefited conventional
forms of video indexing. Affective video indexing faces unique challenges,
since viewer-reported affective reactions are difficult to assess. Moreover
affect assessment efforts must be carefully designed in order to both cover the
types of affective responses that video content evokes in viewers and also
capture the stable and consistent aspects of these responses. We first present
background information on affect and multimedia and related work on affective
multimedia indexing, including existing corpora. Three dimensions emerge as
critical for affective video corpora, and form the basis for our proposed
guidelines: the context of viewer response, personal variation among viewers,
and the effectiveness and efficiency of corpus creation. Finally, we present
examples of three recent corpora and discuss how these corpora make progressive
steps towards fulfilling the guidelines.

in the capital relief that CDS contracts provide, we introduce a CDS pricing

markets are complete, with no CDS bond basis, then CDSs can be replicated by
taking short positions in risky floating bonds issued by the reference entity
and a riskless bank account. If these conditions do not hold, then it is
theoretically possible that the capital relief that CDSs provide may be priced
in. Thus our model provides bounds on the CDS-implied hazard rates when markets
are incomplete. Under simple assumptions we show that 20% to over 50% of

electronic structure of \beta-MnO2. From collinear spin polarized calculations
we find that DFT+U_Eff predicts a gapless ferromagnet in contrast with
experiment which indicates an insulating antiferromagnet. The inclusion of
anisotropic Coulomb and exchange interactions in the DFT+U approach, defining U
and J explicitly, corrects these errors and leads to an antiferromagnetic
ground state with a fundamental gap of 0.8 eV consistent with low temperature
experiments. To our knowledge, this work on \beta-MnO2 represents the first
demonstration of a case in which the application of fully anisotropic
interactions in DFT+U determines the magnetic order and consequent band gap,
while the more commonly used effective U approach fails. Such effects are
argued to be of importance in many insulating materials. The mechanism leading
to an increase in band gap due to anisotropic interactions is highlighted by
analytical calculation of DFT+U d-orbital eigenvalues obtained within a
Kanamori-type model. Magnetic coupling constants obtained by the fitting of a
Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian to the energies of a range of magnetic states
assist in rationalizing the finding that anisotropic interactions enhance the
stability of the experimentally observed helical antiferromagnetic order. The
plane wave PAW method yields poorer results for the exchange couplings than
full-potential LAPW calculations. Finally, we compare the DFT+U results with
exchange couplings obtained from hybrid functionals. It is argued that
anisotropic interactions should be included in DFT+U if the results are to be
properly compared with those from hybrid functionals.

method for the demarcation of the linker based on a three-dimensional protein
structure and a domain definition. The proposed method is based on biological
knowledge about structural flexibility of the linkers. We performed structural
analysis on a linker probable region (LPR) around domain boundary points of
known SCOP domains. The LPR was described using a set of overlapping peptide
fragments of fixed size. Each peptide fragment was then described by geometric
invariants (GIs) and subjected to clustering process where the fragments
corresponding to actual linker come up as outliers. We then discover the actual
linkers by finding the longest continuous stretch of outlier fragments from
LPRs. This method was evaluated on a benchmark dataset of 51 continuous
multi-domain proteins, where it achieves F1 score of 0.745 (0.83 precision and
0.66 recall). When the method was applied on 725 continuous multi-domain
proteins, it was able to identify novel linkers that were not reported

defined from the difference between the energy density and the far field energy
equals the new energy expressions proposed by Vandenbosch for many cases. This
also explains the observed cases with negative stored energy and suggests a
possible remedy to them. The results are compared with the classical explicit
expressions for spherical regions where the results only differ by ka that is
interpreted as the far-field energy in the interior of the sphere. Numerical
results of the Q-factors for dipole, loop, and inverted L-antennas are also
compared with estimates from circuit models and differentiation of the

the stored energy in the Brune synthesized circuit models whereas the
differentiated impedance gives a lower value for some cases. The corresponding
results for the bandwidth suggest that the inverse proportionality between
bandwidth and Q depends on the relative bandwidth or equivalent the threshold
of the reflection coefficient. The Q from the differentiated impedance and

high Reynolds numbers, the associated Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to
a set of coupled Korteweg-de Vries-type (KdV) equations that support inviscid
and smooth travelling waves numerically computed using the Petviashvili method.
In physical space they correspond to localized toroidal vortices concentrated
near the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or that wrap around the pipe axis
(centre vortexons), in agreement with the analytical soliton solutions derived
by Fedele (2012). The KdV dynamics of a perturbation is also investigated by
means of an high accurate Fourier-based numerical scheme. We observe that an
initial vortical patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating patches of
vorticity near the wall. These can undergo further splitting leading to a
proliferation of centre vortexons that eventually decay due to viscous effects.
The splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal vorticity from
the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with the inverse cascade of cross-stream
vorticity identified in channel flows by Eyink (2008). The inviscid vortexon
most likely is unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances and may be a precursor
to puffs and slug flow formation.

highly varying diffusion coefficient in $L^\infty(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{d\times
d}_{sym})$ with uniform spectral bounds and without any assumption on scale
separation or periodicity. The multiscale method uses a corrected basis that is
computed on patches/subdomains. The error, due to truncation of corrected
basis, decreases exponentially with the size of the patches. Hence, to achieve
an algebraic convergence rate of the multiscale solution on a uniform mesh with
mesh size $H$ to a reference solution, it is sufficient to choose the patch
sizes as $\mathcal{O}(H|\log(H^{-1})|)$. We also discuss a way to further
localize the corrected basis to element-wise support leading to a slight
increase of the dimension of the space. Improved convergence rate can be
achieved depending on the piecewise regularity of the forcing function. Linear
convergence in energy norm and quadratic convergence in $L^2$-norm is obtained
independently of the forcing function. A series of numerical experiments
confirms the theoretical rates of convergence.

the data and hence the reality of the small eccentricities found for most of
the stars.
  The Hercules spectrograph and 1-m McLellan telescope at Mt John Observatory,
New Zealand, were used to obtain over 450 CCD spectra between 2004 October and
2007 August. Radial velocities were obtained by cross-correlation. These data
were used to achieve high-precision orbital solutions for all the systems
studied, sometimes with solutions up to about 50 times more precise than those
from the earlier literature. However, the precision of the solutions is limited
in some cases by the rotational velocity or chromospheric activity of the
stars.
  The data for the six binaries analysed here are combined with those for six
stars analysed earlier by Komonjinda, Hearnshaw and Ramm.We have performed
tests using the prescription of Lucy on all 12 binaries, and conclude that,
with one exception, none of the small eccentricities found by fitting Keplerian
orbits to the radial-velocity data can be supported. Instead we conclude that
small non-Keplerian effects, which are clearly detectable for six of our stars,
make impossible the precise determination of spectroscopic binary orbital
eccentricities for many late-type stars to better than about 0.03 in
eccentricity, unless the systematic perturbations are also carefully modelled.
The magnitudes of the non-Keplerian velocity variations are given
quantitatively.

originate from nonreactive collisions, chemical formation, or far infrared,
near-infrared, and optical fluorescences. As a template, we investigate the
impact of each of these processes on the excitation of the methylidyne cation
CH+ and on the intensities of its rotational transitions recently detected in
emission in dense photodissociation regions (PDRs) and in planetary nebulae.
Methods. We have developed a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE)
excitation model that includes the entire energy structure of CH+, i.e. taking
into account the pumping of its vibrational and bound and unbound electronic
states by near-infrared and optical photons. The model includes the theoretical
cross-sections of nonreactive collisions with H, H2, He, and e-, and a
Boltzmann distribution is used to describe the probability of populating the
excited levels of CH+ during its chemical formation by hydrogenation of C+. To
confirm our results we also performed an extensive analytical study, which we
use to predict the main excitation process of several diatomic molecules,
namely HF, HCl, SiO, CS, and CO. Results. At densities nH = 10^4 cm-3, the
excitation of the rotational levels of CH+ is dominated by the radiative
pumping of its electronic, vibrational, and rotational states if the
intensities of the radiation field at \sim 0.4, \sim 4, and \sim 300 \mum are
stronger than 10^5, 10^8, and 10^4 times those of the local interstellar
radiation field (ISRF). Below these values, the chemical pumping is the
dominant source of excitation of the J > 1 levels, even at high kinetic
temperatures (\sim 1000 K). The far-infrared emission lines of CH+ observed in
the Orion Bar and the NGC 7027 PDRs are consistent with the predictions of our
excitation model assuming an incident far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field of
\sim 3 \times 10^4 (in Draine's unit) and densities of \sim 5 \times 10^4 and
\sim 2 \times 10^5 cm-3. In the case of NGC 7027, the estimate of the density
is 10 to 100 times lower than those deduced by traditional excitation codes.
Applying our model to other X1\Sigma+ ground state diatomic molecules, we find
that HF, and SiO and HCl are the species the most sensitive to the radiative
pumping of their vibrational and bound electronic states. In both cases, the
minimal near-infrared and optical/UV radiation field intensities required to
modify their rotational level populations are \sim 10^3 times those of the
local ISRF at densities nH = 10^4 cm-3. All these results point towards
interstellar and circumstellar media with densities lower than previously
established and cast doubts on the clumpiness of well-studied molecular clouds.

solar dynamos: the one that is responsible for the appearance of sunspots and
the 11-yr cycle, frequently referred to as the ""global dynamo"", and a
statistically time-invariant dynamo, generally referred to as the ""local

structuring observed at small scales. Here we examine the relative
contributions of these two qualitatively different dynamos to the small-scale
magnetic flux, with the following conclusion: The local dynamo does not play a
significant role at any of the spatially resolved scales, nearly all the
small-scale flux, including the flux revealed by Hinode, is supplied by the
global dynamo. This conclusion is reached by careful determination of the Sun's
noise-corrected basal magnetic flux density while making use of a flux
cancellation function determined from Hinode data. The only allowed range where
there may be substantial or even dominating contributions from a local dynamo
seems to be the scales below about 10 km, as suggested by observations of the
Hanle depolarization effect in atomic spectral lines. To determine the fraction
of the Hanle depolarization that may be due to the action of a local dynamo, a
synoptic program is being initiated at IRSOL (Istituto Ricerche Solari
Locarno).

usually efficient as well, since host and coprocessor are of the same
architectural family, making optimization techniques designed for the Xeon CPU
also beneficial on Xeon Phi. As a result, highly optimized Xeon codes (like the
TBB library) work well on both.
  In this paper we present a new parallel library construct, which makes it
easy to apply a function to every member of an array in parallel, dynamically
distributing the work between the host CPUs and one or more coprocessor cards.
We describe the associated runtime support and use a physical simulation
example to demonstrate that our library construct can be used to quickly create
a C++ application that will significantly benefit from hybrid execution,
simultaneously exploiting CPU cores and coprocessor cores. Experimental results
show that one optimized source code is sufficient to make the host and the

chain driven through a narrow pore has been investigated theoretically and by
means of extensive Molecular-Dynamics (MD) simulation. The theoretical
consideration is based on the so-called velocity Langevin (V-Langevin) equation
which determines the progress of the translocation in terms of the number of
polymer segments, $s(t)$, that have passed through the pore at time $t$ due to
a driving force $f$. The formalism is based only on the assumption that, due to
thermal fluctuations, the translocation velocity $v=\dot{s}(t)$ is a Gaussian
random process as suggested by our MD data. With this in mind we have derived
the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) which has a nonlinear drift term
and diffusion term with a {\em time-dependent} diffusion coefficient $D(t)$.
Our MD simulation reveals that the driven translocation process follows a {\em
super}diffusive law with a running diffusion coefficient $D(t) \propto
t^{\gamma}$ where $\gamma < 1$. This finding is then used in the numerical
solution of the FPE which yields an important result: for comparatively small
driving forces fluctuations facilitate the translocation dynamics. As a
consequence, the exponent $\alpha$ which describes the scaling of the mean
translocation time $<\tau>$ with the length $N$ of the polymer, $<\tau> \propto
N^{\alpha}$ is found to diminish. Thus, taking thermal fluctuations into
account, one can explain the systematic discrepancy between theoretically
predicted duration of a driven translocation process, considered usually as a
deterministic event, and measurements in computer simulations. In the
non-driven case, $f=0$, the translocation is slightly subdiffusive and can be
treated within the framework of fractional Brownian motion (fBm).

permutation of the elements of $\mathbb{F}_q$. In 1897 Dickson gave what he
claimed to be a complete list of PPs of degree at most 6, however there have
been suggestions recently that this classification might be incomplete.
Unfortunately, Dickson's claim of a full characterisation is not easily
verified because his published proof is difficult to follow. This is mainly due
to antiquated terminology. In this project we present a full reconstruction of
the classification of degree 6 PPs, which combined with a recent paper by Li

degree up to 6.
  In addition, we give a survey of the major results on PPs since Dickson's
1897 paper. Particular emphasis is placed on the proof of the so-called
\emph{Carlitz Conjecture}, which states that if $q$ is odd and `large' and $n$
is even then there are no PPs of degree $n$. This important result was resolved
in the affirmative by research spanning three decades. A generalisation of
Carlitz's conjecture due to Mullen proposes that if $q$ is odd and `large' and
$n$ is even then no polynomial of degree $n$ is `close' to being a PP. This has
remained an unresolved problem in published literature. We provide a
counterexample to Mullen's conjecture, and also point out how recent results
imply a more general version of this statement (provided one increases what is
meant by $q$ being `large').

In this paper we study the corresponding scattering processes of the elementary
objects whose occupancy configurations generate the energy eigenstates from the
electron vacuum. Due to the related occurrence of an infinite set of
conservation laws associated with the model integrability, such objects are
found to undergo only zero-momentum forward-scattering collisions. The
description of the model dynamical properties in terms of such elementary
objects scattering events then drastically simplifies. The corresponding 1D
Hubbard model scattering theory refers to arbitrary values of the densities and
finite repulsive interaction U>0. Each ground-state - excited-state transition
is associated with a well defined set of elementary zero-momentum
forward-scattering events. The elementary-object scatterers dressed S matrix is
expressed as a commutative product of S matrices, each corresponding to a
two-object scattering event. This commutative factorization is stronger than
the factorization associated with Yang-Baxter equation for the original
spin-1/2 electron bare S matrix. The power-law singularities exponents in the
finite-energy correlation-functions of the metallic phases of a wide class of
1D integrable and non-integrable systems are momentum dependent. In the present
exactly solvable model such an exponent momentum dependence is controlled by
the phase shifts and corresponding dressed S matrix considered in this paper.
