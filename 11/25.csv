cortical circuit model of neural networks composed of irregular spiking
excitatory and inhibitory neurons having type 1 and 2 excitability and
stochastic dynamics. In the model, neurons form a sparsely connected network
and their spontaneous activity is driven by random spikes representing synaptic
noise. Using simulations and analytical calculations, we found that if the STSD
is absent, the neural network shows either asynchronous behavior or regular
network oscillations depending on the noise level. In networks with STSD,
changing parameters of synaptic plasticity and the noise level, we observed
transitions to complex patters of collective activity: mixed-mode and spindle
oscillations, bursts of collective activity, and chaotic behaviour.
Interestingly, these patterns are stable in a certain range of the parameters
and separated by critical boundaries. Thus, the parameters of synaptic
plasticity can play a role of control parameters or switchers between different
network states. However, changes of the parameters caused by a disease may lead
to dramatic impairment of ongoing neural activity. We analyze the chaotic
neural activity by use of the 0-1 test for chaos (Gottwald, G. & Melbourne, I.,

of a theoretical hail storm which gathers in intensity before subsiding, and
which travels linearly across the landscape at constant velocity. We start by
assuming a simpler model, that of a storm which does not move, restricted to
having an uncorrelated binormal distribution of damage. This model, expressed
in the natural polar coordinates, leads to a 1-dimensional pattern of damage as
a function of the marginal radial distance conforming to the
$\chi$-distribution with two degrees of freedom. The model is then extended to
the traveling form, allowing further for a correlation of the variables,
extending, as well, to the multidimensional case. In its full florescence the
model produces hyperellipsoidal hypersurfaces of equal intensity for the
correlated multinormal assumption. We provide closed-form solutions for the
totality of damages upon these hypersurfaces as proxies for the insurance
claims to follow. Finally the model is applied to extensive datasets of hail
events, as detected by the NEXRAD network of weather radars.

using hierarchical models. We provide a Bayesian formulation of such models
using data augmentation which preserves the individual encounter histories in
the model and, as such, is amenable to modeling individual effects. We
formulate the model by conditioning on the total population size among all

multinomial model that allocates individuals among sites. MCMC is easily
carried out by the introduction of a categorical individual effect, $g_{i}$,
which partitions the total population size. The prior distribution for the

is ignorant of the primary channel state and, hence, of the amount of actual
harm it inflicts on the primary license holder. Sensing the primary transmitter
does not help in this regard. To tackle this issue, we assume in this paper
that the cognitive user can eavesdrop on the ACK/NACK Automatic Repeat reQuest
(ARQ) fed back from the primary receiver to the primary transmitter. Assuming a
primary channel state that follows a Markov chain, this feedback gives the
cognitive radio an indication of the primary link quality. Based on the
ACK/NACK received, we devise optimal transmission strategies for the cognitive
radio so as to maximize a weighted sum of primary and secondary throughput. The
actual weight used during network operation is determined by the degree of
protection afforded to the primary link. We begin by formulating the problem
for a channel with a general number of states. We then study a two-state model
where we characterize a scheme that spans the boundary of the primary-secondary
rate region. Moreover, we study a three-state model where we derive the optimal
strategy using dynamic programming. We also extend our two-state model to a
two-channel case, where the secondary user can decide to transmit on a
particular channel or not to transmit at all. We provide numerical results for
our optimal strategies and compare them with simple greedy algorithms for a
range of primary channel parameters. Finally, we investigate the case where
some of the parameters are unknown and are learned using hidden Markov models

(e.g., a departure from a single point source detection). We also present
radiative transfer modeling of the SED of the FL Cha system and find that the
gap extends from ~0.06 to ~8.3 AU. We demonstrate that the non-zero closure
phases can be explained almost equally well by starlight scattered off the
inner edge of the outer disk or by a (sub)stellar companion. Single-epoch,
single-wavelength SAM observations of transitional disks with large cavities
that could become resolved should thus be interpreted with caution, taking the
disk and its properties into consideration. In the context of a binary model,
the signal is most consistent with a high-contrast (delta_K ~4.8 mag) source at
a ~40 mas (6 AU) projected separation. However, the flux ratio and separation
parameters remain highly degenerate and a much brighter source (deta_K ~1 mag)
at 15 mas (2.4 AU) can also reproduce the signal. Second-epoch,
multi-wavelength observations are needed to establish the nature of the SAM

molecular evolution of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest
receptor family in Metazoa. In particular, we have analyzed the site-specific
rate variation across the two primary structural partitions, transmembrane (TM)
and extramembrane (EM), of these membrane proteins. We find that transmembrane
domains evolve more slowly than do extramembrane domains, though TM domains
display increased rate heterogeneity relative to their EM counterparts.
Although the majority of residues across GPCRs experience strong to weak
purifying selection, many GPCRs experience positive selection at both TM and EM
residues, albeit with a slight bias towards the EM. Further, a subset of GPCRs,
chemosensory receptors (including olfactory and taste receptors), exhibit
increased rates of evolution relative to other GPCRs, an effect which is more
pronounced in their TM spans. Although it has been previously suggested that
the TM's low evolutionary rate is caused by their high percentage of buried
residues, we show that their attenuated rate seems to stem from the strong
biophysical constraints of the membrane itself, or by functional requirements.
In spite of the strong evolutionary constraints acting on the transmembrane
spans of GPCRs, positive selection and high levels of evolutionary rate
variability are common. Thus, biophysical constraints should not be presumed to
preclude a protein's ability to evolve.

many respects. Man-made polarized sources are often not located in the
antenna's far-field, have spectral properties that are radically different from
the CMB's, are cumbersome to implement and may be inherently unstable over the

inflationary epoch. Astrophysical sources suffer from time, frequency and
spatial variability, are not visible from all CMB observatories, and none are
understood with sufficient accuracy to calibrate future CMB polarimeters
seeking to probe inflationary energy scales of $10^{15}$ GeV. CMB $TB$ and $EB$
modes, expected to identically vanish in the standard cosmological model, can
be used to calibrate CMB polarimeters. By enforcing the observed $EB$ and $TB$

levels not possible with man-made or astrophysical sources. All of this can be
accomplished without any loss of observing time using a calibration source

routing function with another while the network keeps running. The main
challenge is avoiding deadlock anomalies while keeping limitations on message
injection and forwarding minimal. Current approaches, whose complexity is so
high that their practical applicability is limited, either require the
existence of extra network resources like virtual channels, or they affect the
performance of the network during the reconfiguration process. In this paper we
present a simple, fast and efficient mechanism for dynamic network
reconfiguration which is based on regressive deadlock recoveries instead of
avoiding deadlocks. The mechanism which is referred to as DBR guarantees a
deadlock-free reconfiguration based on wormhole switching (WS) and it does not
require additional resources. In this approach, the need for a reliable message
transmission has led to a modified WS mechanism which includes additional flits
or control signals. DBR allows cycles to be formed and in such conditions when
a deadlock occurs, the messages suffer from time-out. Then, this method
releases the buffers and channels from the current node and thus the source
retransmits the message after a random time gap. Evaluating results reveal that
the mechanism shows substantial performance improvements over the other methods
and it works efficiently in different topologies with various routing
algorithms.

immersed in solution containing spin 5/2 Mn^2+ ions and the NV decoherence rate
measured though optically detected magnetic resonance. The presence of both
freely moving and accreted Mn spins in solution were detected via significant
changes in measured NV decoherence rates. Analysis of the data using a quantum
cluster expansion treatment of the NV-target system found the measurements to
be consistent with the detection of ~2,500 motionally diffusing Mn spins over
an effective volume of (16 nm)^3 in 4.2 s, representing a reduction in target

attracted much attention in the research community in the past few years. LP
decoding has been derived for binary and nonbinary linear codes. However, the
most important problem with LP decoding for both binary and nonbinary linear
codes is that the complexity of standard LP solvers such as the simplex
algorithm remains prohibitively large for codes of moderate to large block
length. To address this problem, two low-complexity LP (LCLP) decoding
algorithms for binary linear codes have been proposed by Vontobel and Koetter,
henceforth called the basic LCLP decoding algorithm and the subgradient LCLP
decoding algorithm.
  In this paper, we generalize these LCLP decoding algorithms to nonbinary
linear codes. The computational complexity per iteration of the proposed
nonbinary LCLP decoding algorithms scales linearly with the block length of the
code. A modified BCJR algorithm for efficient check-node calculations in the
nonbinary basic LCLP decoding algorithm is also proposed, which has complexity
linear in the check node degree.
  Several simulation results are presented for nonbinary LDPC codes defined
over Z_4, GF(4), and GF(8) using quaternary phase-shift keying and
8-phase-shift keying, respectively, over the AWGN channel. It is shown that for
some group-structured LDPC codes, the error-correcting performance of the
nonbinary LCLP decoding algorithms is similar to or better than that of the
min-sum decoding algorithm.

the number of documents increases and in terms of visualization clusters, our
motivation was to experiment these cellular automata by increasing the size to
view the impact of size on quality of results. The representation of textual
data was carried out by a vector model whose components are derived from the
overall balancing of the used corpus, Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF). The WorldNet thesaurus has been used to address the problem of the
lemmatization of the words because the representation used in this study is
that of the bags of words. Another independent method of the language was used
to represent textual records is that of the n-grams. Several measures of
similarity have been tested. To validate the classification we have used two
measures of assessment based on the recall and precision (f-measure and
entropy). The results are promising and confirm the idea to increase the
dimension to the problem of the spatiality of the classes. The results obtained
in terms of purity class (i.e. the minimum value of entropy) shows that the
number of documents over longer believes the results are better for 3D cellular
automata, which was not obvious to the 2D dimension. In terms of spatial
navigation, cellular automata provide very good 3D performance visualization
than 2D cellular automata.

insights into the flavor structure of elementary particles, especially the CP
violation. The accelerator control system at KEKB and injector linac was
initiated by a combination of scripting languages at the operation layer and
EPICS at the equipment layer. During the project many features were implemented
to achieve extreme performance out of the machine. Especially the online
linkage to the accelerator simulation played an essential role. In order to
further improve the reliability and flexibility two major concepts were
additionally introduced later in the project, namely the channel access
everywhere and the dual-tier controls. Based on the improved control system a
concept of virtual accelerators were realized that enables the single injector

respectively. Those control technologies are indispensable for the future
particle accelerators.

relation between the effective UV attenuation (A_IRX) and the UV spectral slope
(beta) in a sample of 450 1<z<2.5 galaxies. The FIR data is from very deep
Herschel observations in the GOODS fields that allow us to detect galaxies with
SFRs typical of galaxies with log(M)>9.3. Thus, we are able to study galaxies
on and even below the main SFR-stellar mass relation (main sequence). We find
that main sequence galaxies form a tight sequence in the IRX--beta plane, which
has a flatter slope than commonly used relations. This slope favors a SMC-like
UV extinction curve, though the interpretation is model dependent. The scatter
in the IRX-beta plane, correlates with the position of the galaxies in the
SFR-M plane. Using a smaller sample of galaxies with CO gas masses, we study
the relation between the UV attenuation and the molecular gas content. We find
a very tight relation between the scatter in the IRX-beta plane and the
specific attenuation (S_A), a quantity that represents the attenuation
contributed by the molecular gas mass per young star. S_A is sensitive to both
the geometrical arrangement of stars and dust, and to the compactness of the
star forming regions. We use this empirical relation to derive a method for
estimating molecular gas masses using only widely available integrated
rest-frame UV and FIR photometry. The method produces gas masses with an
accuracy between 0.12-0.16 dex in samples of normal galaxies between z~0 and
z~1.5. Major mergers and sub-millimeter galaxies follow a different S_A
relation.

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1203.5819",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Turbulence is defined as an eddy-like state of fluid motion where the
inertial-vortex forces of the eddies are larger than any other forces that tend
to damp the eddies out. By this definition, turbulence always cascades from
small scales where vorticity is created to larger scales where turbulence
fossilizes. Fossil turbulence is any perturbation in a hydrophysical field
produced by turbulence that persists after the fluid is no longer turbulent at
the scale of the perturbation. Fossil turbulence patterns and fossil turbulence
waves preserve and propagate energy and information about previous turbulence.
Ignorance of fossil turbulence properties can be dangerous. Examples include
the Osama bin Laden helicopter crash and the Air France 447 Airbus crash, both
unfairly blamed on the pilots. Observations support the proposed definitions,
and suggest even direct numerical simulations of turbulence require caution.
