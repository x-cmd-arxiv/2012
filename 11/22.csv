in human cells. When DNA is damaged p53 induces the cell cycle arrest to
prevent the transmission of the damage to cell progeny, triggers the production
of proteins for DNA repair and ultimately calls for apoptosis. In particular,
the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop seems to be the key circuit in this response of
cells to damage. For many years, based on measurements over populations of
cells it was believed that the p53-Mdm2 feedback loop was the responsible for
the existence of damped oscillations in the levels of p53 and Mdm2 after DNA
damage. However, recent measurements in individual human cells have shown that
p53 and its regulator Mdm2 develop sustained oscillations over long periods of
time even in the absence of stress. These results have attracted a lot of
interest, first because they open a new experimental framework to study the p53
and its interactions and second because they challenge years of mathematical
models with new and accurate data on single cells. Inspired by these
experiments standard models of the p53-Mdm2 circuit were modified introducing
ad-hoc some biologically motivated noise that becomes responsible for the
stability of the oscillations. Here, we follow an alternative approach
proposing that the noise that stabilizes the fluctuations is the intrinsic
noise due to the finite nature of the populations of p53 and Mdm2 in a single
cell.

$\mu$ parameter between 100-200 GeV, with large (but perturbative) $\lambda$

focusing on the observable Higgs cross sections into $\gamma \gamma$, $WW$,
$ZZ$, $bb$, $\tau \tau$ final states, and study the correlations between these
observables. We show that the $\gamma \gamma$ signal strength may be enhanced
up to a factor of about two not only due to the effect of singlet-doublet
mixing, which occurs more often when the 126 GeV Higgs boson is the
next-to-lightest CP-even one, but also due to light stops (and to a lesser
extent light chargino and charged Higgs loops). There may be also smaller
enhancements in the Higgs decay channels into $WW$, $ZZ$, correlated with the
$\gamma \gamma$ enhancement. However there is no such correlation observed
involving the Higgs decay channels into $bb$, $\tau \tau$. The requirement of
having perturbative couplings up to the GUT scale favours the interpretation of
the 126 GeV Higgs boson as being the second lightest NMSSM CP-even state, which
can decay into pairs of lighter neutralinos, CP-even or CP-odd Higgs bosons,
leading to characteristic signatures of the NMSSM. In a non-negligible part of
the parameter range the increase in the $\gamma\gamma$ rate is due to the
superposition of rates from nearly degenerate Higgs bosons. Resolving these

Pacific is due to NNE- to ENE-ward motion of east Eurasia. This mainly was a
response to the Indo-Asia collision which started about 50 Ma ago. The
displacement of east Eurasia can be estimated using three aspects: (1) the
magnitude of pull-apart of the dextral pull-apart basin system, (2)
paleomagnetic data from eastern Eurasia and the region around the Arctic, and
(3) the shortening deficits in the Large Tibetan Plateau. All the three aspects
indicate that there was a large amount (about 1200 km) of northward motion of
the South China block and compatible movements of other blocks in eastern
Eurasia during the rifting period of the basin system. Such large motion of the
eastern Eurasia region contradicts any traditional rigid plate tectonic
reconstruction, but agrees with the more recent concepts of non-rigidity of
both continental and oceanic lithosphere over geological times. Based on these
estimates, the method developed for restoration of background diffuse
deformation of the Eurasian plate and the region around the Arctic, and the
related kinematics of the marginal basins, we present plate tectonic
reconstruction of these marginal basins in global plate tectonic settings at
the four key times: 50, 35, 15 and 5 Ma. The plate tectonic reconstruction
shows that the first-order rift stage and post-rift stage of the marginal
basins are correlated with the first-order slow uplift stage and the rapid
uplift stage of the Tibetan Plateau, respectively. The proto-Philippine Sea
basin was trapped as a sinistral transpressional pop-up structure at a position
that was 20{\deg}south of its present position. While the Japan arc migrated
eastward during the rifting period of the Japan Sea basin, the Shikoku Basin

has assumed an important dimension. The security of transmitted data over a
wireless channel aims at protecting the data from unauthorized intrusion.
Wireless network security is achieved using cryptographic primitives. Some
properties that give encryption mechanism their cryptographic strength also
make them very sensitive to channel error as well. Therefore, security for data
transmission over wireless channel results in throughput loss. Trade-off
between security and throughput is always a major concern in wireless networks.
In this paper, a Link Adaptive Encryption scheme is evaluated that adapts to
channel variations and enhances the security level of WLANs without making any
compromise with the network performance. Numerical results obtained through
simulation are compared with the fixed block length encryption technique in two
different modes of operation- Electronic Code Book (ECB) & Cipher Block
Chaining (CBC). Optimal block length is also computed, which is assumed to be
the effective strength of the cipher. It has been observed that security
attained with link adaptive scheme operating in ECB mode of cipher is a better
solution for security and throughput trade-off. However, it is found that if
computational security is a major concern, link adaptive scheme in CBC mode
should be preferred.

build an $O(n)$-size data structure in $O(n\log n)$ time that can support

[\int_\D|u(z)|^p (1-|z|^2)^{\alpha}\diff A(z)<+\infty,] must then
$u(z)\equiv0$? Here, $N$ is a positive integer, $\alpha$ is real, and
$0<p<+\infty$; $\diff A$ is the usual area element. The answer will, generally
speaking, depend on the triple $(N,p,\alpha)$. The most interesting case is
$0<p<1$. For a given $N$, we find an explicit critical curve
$p\mapsto\beta(N,p)$ -- a piecewise affine function -- such that for
$\alpha>\beta(N,p)$ there exist non-trivial functions $u$ with $\Delta^N u=0$
of the given integrability, while for $\alpha\le\beta(N,p)$, only $u(z)\equiv0$
is possible. We also investigate the obstruction to uniqueness for the

$\mathrm{PH}^p_{N,\alpha}(\D)$ when this space is nontrivial. We find a
fascinating structural decomposition of the polyharmonic functions -- the
cellular (Almansi) expansion -- which decomposes the polyharmonic weighted

atomic layer precision. These layered structures have already led to a range of
fascinating physical phenomena, and also have been used in demonstrating a
prototype field effect tunnelling transistor - a candidate for post-CMOS
technology. The range of possible materials which could be incorporated into
such stacks is very large. Indeed, there are many other materials where layers
are linked by weak van der Waals forces, which can be exfoliated and combined
together to create novel highly-tailored heterostructures. Here we describe a
new generation of field effect vertical tunnelling transistors where 2D
tungsten disulphide serves as an atomically thin barrier between two layers of
either mechanically exfoliated or CVD-grown graphene. Our devices have
unprecedented current modulation exceeding one million at room temperature and
can also operate on transparent and flexible substrates.

paramagnetic insulator, Mott-insulator with $120^{\circ}$ antiferromagnetic and
a non-magnetic insulating state, i.e. possibly a spin liquid state. This

momentum-energy space which is employed in linear response theory to determine
the magnetic susceptibility in coordinate space. Analytic results are obtained
for gapped graphene when the magnetic impurities are placed on the $A$ and $B$

determining spin ordering, has been found to be significantly different for
$AA$ and $BB$ exchange energies in doped graphene due to the existence of an
energy gap, and is attributed to a consequence of the local fields not being
equal on the $A$ and $B$ sublattices. For doped graphene, the oscillations of
all three RKKY interactions from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic with
increasing Fermi energy is significantly modified by the energy gap both in
magnitude and phase. Additionally, the $AB$ exchange energy may be modified by
the presence of a gap for undoped graphene but not for doped graphene due to
the dominance of doped conduction electrons.

that the exciton-polariton parametric scattering allows us to reverse the sign

coupled microcavity with a linearly polarized pump at normal incidence. The
energy of the pulse is set to be close to the inflexion point of the polariton
dispersion and the focusing in real space populates the reciprocal space on a
ring. For pumping powers below the parametric scattering threshold, the
propagation of the injected polaritons in the effective magnetic field induced
by the TE and TM splitting produce the normal optical spin-Hall effect. Keeping
the same input polarization but increasing the pump intensity, the parametric
scattering towards an idler and a signal state is triggered on the whole
elastic circle. The injected particles are scattered toward these states while
propagating radially all over the plane, gaining a cross linear polarisation
with respect to the pump during the nonlinear process. Eventually, the
propagation of the polaritons in the effective field results in the optical
spin Hall-effect, but this time with inverted polarization domains.

model for the central engine that powers gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). If the
central black hole rotates and a poloidal magnetic field threads its horizon, a
powerful relativistic jet may be driven by a process resembling the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism. We estimate the luminosity of such a jet assuming
that the poloidal magnetic field strength is comparable to the inner accretion
disk pressure. We show that the jet efficiency attains its maximal value when
the accretion flow is cooled via optically-thin neutrino emission. The jet
luminosity is much larger than the energy deposition through
neutrino-antineutrino annihilation provided that the black hole is spinning
rapidly enough. When the accretion rate onto a rapidly spinning black hole is
large enough (> 0.003-0.01M_sun/sec), the predicted jet luminosity is
sufficient to drive a GRB.

multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ (BFO), a material in which the FE order parameter
coexists with anti-ferrodistortive (AFD) modes involving rotations of the O$_6$
octahedra. We find that the energetics of the DWs are dominated by the
capability of the domains to match their O$_6$ octahedra rotation patterns at
the plane of the wall, so that the distortion of the oxygen groups is
minimized. Our results thus indicate that, in essence, it is the discontinuity
in the AFD order parameter, and not the change in the electric polarization,
what decides which crystallographic planes are most likely to host BFO's
FE-DWs. Such a result clearly suggests that the O$_6$ rotational patterns play
a primary role in the FE phase of this compound, in contrast with the usual
(implicit) assumption that they are subordinated to the FE order parameter. Our
calculations show that, for the most favorable cases in BFO, the DW energy
amounts to a several tens of mJ/m$^2$, which is higher than what was computed
for other ferroelectric perovskites with no O$_6$ rotations. Interestingly, we
find that the structure of BFO at the most stable DWs resembles the atomic
arrangements that are characteristic of low-lying (meta)stable phases of the
material. Further, we argue that our results for the DWs of bulk BFO are
related with the nanoscale-twinned structures that Prosandeev et al. [Adv.
Funct. Mats. (2012), doi: 10.1002/adfm.201201467] have recently predicted to
occur in this compound, and suggest that BFO can be viewed as a polytypic
material. Our work thus contributes to shape a coherent picture of the
structural variants that BFO can present and the way in which they are related.

disruption event Swift J1644+57. The data at early times ($\lesssim 5$ days)
necessitates separation of the radio and X-ray emission regions, either
spatially or in velocity space. This leads us to suggest a two component jet
model, in which the inner jet is initially relativistic with Lorentz factor
$\Gamma \approx 15$, while the outer jet is trans-relativistic, with $\Gamma
\lesssim 1.2$. This model enables a self-consistent interpretation of the late
time radio data, both in terms of peak frequency and flux. We solve the
dynamics, radiative cooling and expected radiation from both jet components. We
show that while during the first month synchrotron emission from the outer jet
dominates the radio emission, at later times radiation from ambient gas
collected by the inner jet dominates. This provides a natural explanation to
the observed re-brightening, without the need for late time inner engine
activity. After 100 days, the radio emission peak is in the optically thick
regime, leading to a decay of both the flux and peak frequency at later times.
Our model's predictions for the evolution of radio emission in jetted tidal
disruption events can be tested by future observations.

are common to all cities, with similar power law exponents. These findings mean
that the larger the city, the more disproportionally they are places of wealth

behavior as predicted by the power law scaling. In this paper we demonstrate
that universities show a similar behavior as cities in the distribution of the
gross university income in terms of total number of citations over size in
terms of total number of publications. Moreover, the power law exponents for
university scaling are comparable to those for urban scaling. We find that
deviations from the expected behavior can indeed be explained by specific local
properties of universities, particularly the field-specific composition of a
university, and its quality in terms of field-normalized citation impact. By
studying both the set of the 500 largest universities worldwide and a specific

global fits in the context of certain particle physics models (e.g. the CMSSM)

potential of discovering new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this paper
we propose an alternative strategy to combine direct and collider dark matter
searches: employing the potential of the upcoming generation of 1-ton direct
detection experiments, we show that for certain supersymmetric configurations
it is possible to translate the information encoded in an hypothetically
discovered direct detection signal into classes of expected signals at the LHC.
As an illustrative application of our method, we show that for a 60 GeV

identifiable prediction for a LHC final state involving three leptons and
missing energy. The strategy presented in this paper to systematically
translate a direct detection signal into a prediction for the LHC has the

modified mean field theory, in which the dielectric response of an arbitrary
condensed matter system to the applied electric field is assumed to consist of
two parts, a collective response and a slowly fluctuating response; the former
corresponds to the cooperative response of the crystalline or noncrystalline
structures composed of the atoms or molecules held together by normal chemical
bonds and the latter represents the slow response of the strongly correlated
high-temperature structure precursors or a partially ordered nematic phase.
These two dielectric responses are not independent of each other but rather
constitute a dynamic hierarchy, in which the slowly fluctuating response is
constrained by the collective response. It then becomes clear that the
dielectric relaxation of the system is actually a specific characteristic
relaxation process modulated by the slow relaxation of the nematic phase and
its corresponding relaxation relationship should be regarded as the universal
dielectric relaxation law. Furthermore, we have shown that seemingly different
relaxation relationships, such as the Debye relaxation law, the Cole-Cole
equation, the Cole-Davidson equation, the Havriliak-Negami relaxation, the

colors of their associated massive metal-rich globular clusters (GCs) in the
sense that the parent galaxies are redder by 0.12-0.20 mag at a given

that the luminosity-weighted ages and metallicities of such galaxies are equal
to that of their averaged massive metal-rich GCs at a given galactocentric

the red GC systems and their parent galaxies cannot be explained by the
presence of multiple stellar generations in massive metal-rich GCs, as the
impact of the latter to the populations' integrated g-z or B-I colors is found
to be negligible. However, we show that this paradox can be explained if the
stellar initial mass function (IMF) in these massive elliptical galaxies was
significantly steeper at subsolar masses than canonical IMFs derived from star
counts in the solar neighborhood, with the GC colors having become bluer due to
dynamical evolution, causing a significant flattening of the stellar MF of the
average surviving GC.

misaligned circumbinary disk normally produces a double peaked
mass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit. This is because each black hole
passes across the circumbinary disk plane and captures gas twice in one orbital
period. Even in misaligned systems, however, a single peaked
mass-accretion-rate variation per binary orbit is produced, if the orbital
eccentricity is moderately large (e\lesssim0.3). The number of peaks in mass
accretion rates can be understood simply in terms of the orbital phase
dependence of the distance between each binary black hole and its closest inner
edge of the circumbinary disk. In the cases of eccentric binary black holes
having different masses, the less massive black hole can get closer to the
circumbinary disk than the massive one, thus tidally splitting gas from its
inner edge, but the created gas flows are comparably captured by both black
holes with a short time delay. As a consequence, the combined light curve shows
periodic occurrence of double-peaked flares with a short interval. This may
account for the observed light variations of OJ287.

number of first-overtone variables (RR1) to five. Our observations were
insufficient to discern the nature of the previously identified RR1 star, V24,
and the tentatively identified RR1 star, V13. These two variables are \sim0.8
mag brighter than the RR Lyrae variables, appear to have somewhat erratic
period and/or luminosity changes, and lie inside the RR Lyrae instability
strip. Curiously, all but one of the RR Lyrae stars studied in this relatively
metal-rich cluster exhibit the Blazhko phenomenon, an effect thought to occur
with higher frequency in metal-poor environments. The mean periods of the RR0
and RR1 variables are <P>_RR0=0.56 pm 0.01 d and <P>_RR1=0.30 pm 0.02 d,
respectively, supporting an Oosterhoff I classification of the cluster. On the
other hand, the number ratio of RR1- to RR0-type variables is high, though not
unprecedented, for an Oosterhoff I cluster. The RR Lyrae variables have no
period shifts at a given amplitude as compared to the M3 variables, making it
unlikely that these variables are He-enhanced. Using the recent recalibration
of the RR Lyrae luminosity scale by Catelan & Cortes, a mean distance modulus
of (m-M)_V= 15.57 pm 0.13 mag for NGC 2808 is obtained, in good agreement with
that determined here from its type II Cepheid and SX Phoenicis population. Our

the primary component being slightly evolved off the main sequence. We discuss
two possible scenarios for the origin of the circumbinary disk: (i)
non-conservative Roche lobe overflow, and (ii) the possibility that the

oblique incidence. Energy spectra reveal periodical character on the whole

Fibonacci rule. The gap associated with the new Dirac point is formed in every

emissions, which emerge from a few days up to a few hours before the main
seismic shock occurrence permit a real-time monitoring of the damage process
during the last stages of earthquake preparation, as it happens at the
laboratory scale. Despite fairly abundant evidence, EM precursors have not been
adequately accepted as credible physical phenomena. These negative views are
enhanced by the fact that certain 'puzzling features' are repetitively observed
in candidate fracture-induced pre-seismic EM emissions. More precisely, EM
silence in all frequency bands appears before the main seismic shock
occurrence, as well as during the aftershock period. Actually, the view that
'acceptance of 'precursive' EM signals without convincing co-seismic signals
should not be expected' seems to be reasonable. In this work we focus on this
point. We examine whether the aforementioned features of EM silence are really
puzzling ones or, instead, reflect well-documented characteristic features of
the fracture process, in terms of: universal structural patterns of the
fracture process, recent laboratory experiments, numerical and theoretical
studies of fracture dynamics, critical phenomena, percolation theory, and
micromechanics of granular materials. Our analysis shows that these features

is whether 1/f noise is generated on the surface of electrical conductors or
inside their volumes. Using high-quality graphene multilayers we were able to
directly address this fundamental problem of the noise origin. Unlike the
thickness of metal or semiconductor films, the thickness of graphene
multilayers can be continuously and uniformly varied all the way down to a

unbarred. With the purpose of providing an appropriate quantification of the
effects of bars, we also constructed a suitable control sample of unbarred AGN
galaxies with similar redshift, magnitude, morphology, bulge sizes and local

full sample of spiral face-on AGN host galaxies, is 28.5%, in good agreement
with previous works. Barred AGN host galaxies show an excess of young stellar
populations dominated by red u-r and g-r colors, with respect to the control
sample, suggesting that bars produce an important effect on galaxy properties
of AGN hosts. Regarding the nuclear activity distribution, we find that barred

less massive, younger stellar population and bluer AGN host galaxies. We found
that the fraction of powerful AGN increase towards more massive hosts with
bluer colors and younger stellar populations residing in denser environments.

networks whereby the primary packets are forwarded by the secondary node
maintaining an extra queue devoted to the relaying function. However, relaying
of primary packets may introduce delays on the secondary packets (called
secondary delay) and require additional power budget in order to forward the
primary packets that is especially crucial when the network is deployed using
sensors with limited power resources. To this end, an admission control can be
employed in order to manage efficiently the relaying in cognitive radio sensor
networks. In this paper, we first analyse and formulate the secondary delay and
the required power budget of the secondary sensor node in relation with the
acceptance factor that indicates whether the primary packets are allowed to be
forwarded or not. Having defined the above, we present the tradeoff between the
secondary delay and the required power budget when the acceptance factor is
adapted. In the sequel, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the
secondary delay over the admission control parameter subject to a limit on the
required power budget plus the constraints related to the stabilities of the
individual queues due to their interdependencies observed by the analysis. The
solution of this problem is provided using iterative decomposition methods i.e.
dual and primal decompositions using Lagrange multipliers that simplifies the
original complicated problem resulting in a final equivalent dual problem that
includes the initial Karush Kuhn Tucker conditions. Using the derived
equivalent dual problem, we obtain the optimal acceptance factor while in
addition we highlight the possibilities for extra delay minimization that is
provided by relaxing the initial constraints through changing the values of the

dependent scenarios, focusing on the case in which the field propagation occurs
in --either a background or effective-- spacetime with spatial sections of flat
compact topology. The discussion finds important applications in cosmology,
like e.g. in the description of test Klein-Gordon fields and scalar
perturbations in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime in the observationally
favored flat case. Two types of ambiguities in the quantization are analyzed.
First, the infinite ambiguity existing in the choice of a Fock representation
for the canonical commutation relations, understandable as the freedom in the
choice of inequivalent vacua for a given field. Besides, in cosmological
situations, it is customary to scale the fields by time dependent functions,
which absorb part of the evolution arising from the spacetime, which is treated
classically. This leads to an additional ambiguity, this time in the choice of
a canonical pair of field variables. We show that both types of ambiguities are
removed by the requirements of (a) invariance of the vacuum under the
symmetries of the three-torus, and (b) unitary implementation of the dynamics
in the quantum theory. In this way, one arrives at a unique class of unitarily
equivalent Fock quantizations for the system. This result provides considerable
robustness to the quantum predictions and renders meaningful the confrontation
with observation.

allow the query of a user's local neighborhood through the interface. To enable
analytics over such an online social network through its restrictive web
interface, many recent efforts reuse the existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo
methods such as random walks to sample the social network and support analytics
based on the samples. The problem with such an approach, however, is the large
amount of queries often required (i.e., a long ""mixing time"") for a random walk
to reach a desired (stationary) sampling distribution.
  In this paper, we consider a novel problem of enabling a faster random walk
over online social networks by ""rewiring"" the social network on-the-fly.
Specifically, we develop Modified TOpology (MTO)-Sampler which, by using only
information exposed by the restrictive web interface, constructs a ""virtual""
overlay topology of the social network while performing a random walk, and
ensures that the random walk follows the modified overlay topology rather than
the original one. We show that MTO-Sampler not only provably enhances the
efficiency of sampling, but also achieves significant savings on query cost
over real-world online social networks such as Google Plus, Epinion etc.

measurement to the noise. The noise spectrum is identified by reversing the
response relationship in the frequency domain. For illustration, the method is
applied to superconducting charge qubits, but it is equally applicable to any
type of qubits. We find that the identification strategy recovers the
well-known Fermi's golden rule under the lowest-order perturbation
approximation, which corresponds to the Markovian limit when the measurement
time is much longer than the noise correlation time. Beyond such approximation,
it is possible to further improve the precision at the so-called optimal point
by incorporating the transient response data in the non-Markovian regime. This
method is verified with experimental data from coherent oscillations in a
superconducting charge qubit.

a simple shift register---a moving window extending into the past, requiring

However, an independent general purpose learner cannot a priori know the

naturally occurring signals show scale-free long range correlations implying
that the natural prediction-relevant timescale is essentially unbounded. Hence
the learner should maintain information from the longest possible timescale

optimally sacrifices the temporal accuracy of information in a scale-free

exponentially long timescales. Using several illustrative examples, we
demonstrate the advantage of the fuzzy memory system over a shift register in

sd interaction between conduction electron and localized spin is theoretically
studied. The motive force is calculated by evaluating the time-derivative of

there are two motive forces, one proportional to $\EvR\times\dot{\nv}$, the
other, perpendicular component, proportional to
$\EvR\times(\nv\times\dot{\nv})$, where $\EvR$ and $\nv$ are the Rashba
electric field and localized spin direction, respectively. The second type
arises in the strong sd coupling regime from the spin relaxation. The
appearance of perpendicular component from the spin relaxation is understood
from the analogy with the current-induced torques. In the case of domain wall
motion, the two contributions to the spin motive force are the same order of
magnitude, while the first term dominates in the case of precession of uniform
magnetization. Our result explains appearance of the perpendicular component in

the gamma-ray and radio emission originate from the annular gap region located
in only one magnetic pole, and the radio emission region is not primarily lower
than the gamma-ray region in most cases. In addition, the annular gap model
with a small magnetic inclination angle instead of ""orthogonal rotator"" can
account for MSPs' radio interpulse with a large phase separation from the main
pulse. The annular gap model is a self-consistent model not only for young
pulsars but also MSPs, and multi-wavelength light curves can be fundamentally

heavy flavour production at LHC. Heavy flavor can be studied via the
identification of short-lived hadrons containing heavy quarks which have a mean
proper decay length in the order of 100-300 $\mu$m. To accomplish this task,
the ITS is composed of six cylindrical layers of silicon detectors (two pixel,
two drift and two strip) with a radial coverage from 3.9 to 43 cm and a
material budget of 1.1% X0 per layer. %In particular, the properties of the two
innermost layers define the ITS performance in measuring the displaced vertex
of such short-lived particles.
  In order to enhance the ALICE physics capabilities, and, in particular, the
tracking performance for heavy-flavour detection, the possibility of an ITS
upgrade has been studied in great detail. It will make use of the spectacular
progress made in the field of imaging sensors over the last ten years as well
as the possibility to install a smaller radius beampipe. The upgraded detector
will have greatly improved features in terms of: the impact parameter
resolution, standalone tracking efficiency at low $p_{t}$, momentum resolution
and readout capabilities.
  The Conceptual Design Report, which covers the design and performance
requirements, the upgrade options, as well as the necessary R&D efforts, was
made public in September 2012. An intensive R&D program has been launched to
review the different technological options under consideration. The new
detector should be ready to be installed during the long LHC shutdown period
scheduled in 2017-2018.

the so-called curse of dimensionality. They are becoming increasingly popular
in many scientific fields including biostatistics, medicine, economics and
financial econometrics. Estimating and testing the model index coefficients
$\bolds{\beta}$ is one of the most important objectives in the statistical
analysis. However, the commonly used assumption on the index coefficients,
$\|\bolds{\beta}\|=1$, represents a nonregular problem: the true index is on
the boundary of the unit ball. In this paper we introduce the EFM approach, a
method of estimating functions, to study the single-index model. The procedure
is to first relax the equality constraint to one with (d-1) components of
$\bolds{\beta}$ lying in an open unit ball, and then to construct the
associated (d-1) estimating functions by projecting the score function to the
linear space spanned by the residuals with the unknown link being estimated by
kernel estimating functions. The root-n consistency and asymptotic normality
for the estimator obtained from solving the resulting estimating equations are
achieved, and a Wilks type theorem for testing the index is demonstrated. A
noticeable result we obtain is that our estimator for $\bolds{\beta}$ has
smaller or equal limiting variance than the estimator of Carroll et al. [J.
Amer. Statist. Assoc. 92 (1997) 447-489]. A fixed-point iterative scheme for
computing this estimator is proposed. This algorithm only involves
one-dimensional nonparametric smoothers, thereby avoiding the data sparsity
problem caused by high model dimensionality. Numerical studies based on
simulation and on applications suggest that this new estimating system is quite
powerful and easy to implement.

solutions for RSVP and quality of service provision over mobile IPv6 networks,

a mathematical model to determine maximum end-to-end delay bound through

material transferred from the outermost part of a Be disk misaligned with the
binary orbital plane. Based on simulated mass-transfer rates from misaligned Be
disks, together with simplified accretion flow models, we show that
mass-accretion rates estimated from the luminosity of the normal X-ray
outbursts are consistent with those obtained with advection-dominated accretion
flows, not with the standard, radiative-cooling dominated, accretion. Our RIAF
scenario for normal X-ray outbursts resolves problems that have challenged the
standard disk picture for these outbursts. When a misaligned Be disk crosses
the orbit of the neutron star, e.g., by warping, the neutron star can capture a
large amount of mass via BHL-type accretion during the disk transit event. We
numerically show that such a process can reproduce the X-ray luminosity of
giant X-ray outbursts. In the case of very high Be disk density, the accretion
flow associated with the disk transit becomes supercritical, giving rise to the
luminosity higher than the Eddington luminosity.

reliable evidence of a long-hypothesized link between changes in solar activity
and Earth's cloud cover remains elusive. This work examines evidence of a
cosmic ray cloud link from a range of sources, including satellite-based cloud
measurements and long-term ground-based climatological measurements. The
satellite-based studies can be divided into two categories: 1) monthly to
decadal timescale correlations, and 2) daily timescale epoch-superpositional
(composite) analysis. The latter analyses frequently focus on high-magnitude
reductions in the cosmic ray flux known as Forbush Decrease (FD) events. At
present, two long-term independent global satellite cloud datasets are
available (ISCCP and MODIS). Although the differences between them are
considerable, neither shows evidence of a solar-cloud link at either long or
short timescales. Furthermore, reports of observed correlations between solar
activity and cloud over the 1983 to 1995 period are attributed to the chance
agreement between solar changes and artificially induced cloud trends. It is
possible that the satellite cloud datasets and analysis methods may simply be
too insensitive to detect a small solar signal. Evidence from ground-based
studies suggests that some weak but statistically significant CR-cloud
relationships may exist at regional scales, involving mechanisms related to the
global electric circuit. However, a poor understanding of these mechanisms and
their effects on cloud make the net impacts of such links uncertain. Regardless
of this, it is clear that there is no robust evidence of a widespread link
between the cosmic ray flux and clouds.

Theorem, offers a promising future in VLSI because of its carry-free operations

helpful to reduce the complexity of calculation in many applications. A residue
number system represents a large integer using a set of smaller integers,

In this paper a new moduli set selection technique is proposed to improve bit
efficiency which can be used to construct a residue system for digital signal
processing environment. Subsequently, it is theoretically proved and
illustrated using examples, that the proposed solution gives better results
than the schemes reported in the literature. The novelty of the architecture is
shown by comparison the different schemes reported in the literature. Using the
novel moduli set, a guideline for a Reconfigurable Processor is presented here
that can process some predefined functions. As RNS minimizes the carry

since ideally defined for any statistical study of the multifrequency
properties of galaxies spanning a large range in morphological type and
luminosity. The spectroscopic observations cover the spectral range 3600-6900 A
at a resolution R ~ 1000 and are thus suitable for separating the underlying
absorption from the emission of the Hbeta line as well as the two [NII] lines
from the Halpha emission. We measure the fluxes and the equivalent widths of
the strongest emission lines ([OII], Hbeta, [OIII], [NII], Halpha, and [SII]).
The data are used to study the distribution of the equivalent width of all the
emission lines, of the Balmer decrement C(Hbeta) and of the observed underlying
Balmer absorption under Hbeta in this sample. Combining these new spectroscopic
data with those available at other frequencies, we also study the dependence of
C(Hbeta) and E.W.Hbeta_{abs} on morphological type, stellar mass and stellar
surface density, star formation rate, birthrate parameter and metallicity in
galaxies belonging to different environments (fields vs. Virgo). The
distribution of the equivalent width of all the emission lines, of C(Hbeta) and
E.W.Hbeta_{abs} are systematically different in cluster and field galaxies. The
Balmer decrement increases with stellar mass, stellar surface density,
metallicity and star formation rate of the observed galaxies, while it is
unexpectedly almost independent from the column density of the atomic and
molecular gas. The dependence of C(Hbeta) on stellar mass is steeper than that
previously found in other works. The underlying Balmer absorption does not
significantly change with any of these physical parameters.

degrade system performance in two-way relay networks. In this paper, we
introduce DNF-AF selection two-way relaying scheme which aims to avoid error
propagation and mitigate noise propagation. If the relay successfully decodes
the exclusive or (XOR) of the messages sent by the two transceivers, it applies
denoise-and-forward (DNF). Otherwise, amplify-and-forward (AF) strategy will be
utilized. In this way, decoding error propagation is avoided at the relay.
Meanwhile, since the relay attempts to decode the XOR of the two messages
instead of explicitly decoding the two messages, the larger usable range of XOR
network coding can be obtained. As XOR network coding can avoid noise
propagation, DNF-AF would mitigate noise propagation. In addition, bit error
rate (BER) performance of DNF-AF selection scheme with BPSK modulation is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Numerical results verify that the
proposed scheme has better BER performance than existing ones.

made using spectral type-colour relations, and over 9600 dwarfs (J<17) with

A total of 68 periodic variable M dwarfs are found in the sample with periods

~0.115 in the J band. We simulate active M dwarfs with a range of
latitude-independent spot coverages and estimate a periodically variable
fractions of 1-3 per cent for stars where spots cover more than 10 per cent of
the star's surface. Our simulated spot distributions indicate that operating in
the J band, where spot contrast ratios are minimised, enables variability in
only the most active of stars to be detected. These findings affirm the

double-quantum-dot system in which a strongly correlated dot (the ""hanging

between two external leads. In zero field, the spectral function of the hanging
dot has previously been shown to exhibit a split-peak structure near the Fermi
level due to ""Kondo resonance filtering"" by the bridging dot. We show using the
numerical renormalization group that application of a magnetic field leads to a
subtle interplay between electronic interference, Kondo physics, and Zeeman
splitting with nontrivial consequences for the spectral and transport
properties. The value of the hanging-dot spectral function at the Fermi level
exhibits a nonuniversal field dependence that can be explained using a
generalized Friedel sum rule for a Kondo system with energy-dependent
hybridization. The magnetic field also accentuates the exchange-mediated
interdot coupling, which dominates the ground state at intermediate fields
leading to the formation of antiparallel magnetic moments on the dots. By
tuning gate voltages and the magnetic field, one can achieve complete spin
polarization of the linear conductance between the leads, raising the prospect
of applications of the device as a highly tunable spin filter. The system's
low-energy properties are qualitatively unchanged by the presence of weak
on-site Coulomb repulsion within the bridging dot.

Multivariate Skew t (FM-uMST) distributions. The package EMMIX-uskew implements
a closed-form expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for computing the maximum
likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters for the (unrestricted) FM-MST model
in R. EMMIX-uskew also supports visualization of fitted contours in two and
three dimensions, and random sample generation from a specified FM-uMST
distribution.
  Finite mixtures of skew t-distributions have proven to be useful in modelling
heterogeneous data with asymmetric and heavy tail behaviour, for example,
datasets from flow cytometry. In recent years, various versions of mixtures
with multivariate skew t (MST) distributions have been proposed. However, these
models adopted some restricted characterizations of the component MST
distributions so that the E-step of the EM algorithm can be evaluated in closed
form. This paper focuses on mixtures with unrestricted MST components, and
describes an iterative algorithm for the computation of the ML estimates of its
model parameters.
  The usefulness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in three
applications to real data sets. The first example illustrates the use of the
main function fmmst in the package by fitting a MST distribution to a bivariate
unimodal flow cytometric sample. The second example fits a mixture of MST
distributions to the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) data, and demonstrate
that EMMIX-uskew can provide better clustering results than mixtures with
restricted MST components. In the third example, EMMIX-uskew is applied to
classify cells in a trivariate flow cytometric dataset. Comparisons with other
available methods suggests that the EMMIX-uskew result achieved a lower
misclassification rate with respect to the labels given by benchmark gating
analysis.

matching this catalogue to several lower frequency surveys (e.g. including a
deep GMRT survey at 610 MHz, a WSRT survey at 1.4 GHz, NVSS, FIRST and WENSS)
we have investigated the radio spectral properties of the sources in this
sample; all but 30 of the 10C sources are matched to one or more of these
surveys. We have found a significant increase in the proportion of flat
spectrum sources at flux densities below approximately 1 mJy - the median
spectral index between 15.7 GHz and 610 MHz changes from 0.75 for flux
densities greater than 1.5 mJy to 0.08 for flux densities less than 0.8 mJy.
This suggests that a population of faint, flat spectrum sources is emerging at
flux densities below 1 mJy.
  The spectral index distribution of this sample of sources selected at 15.7
GHz is compared to those of two samples selected at 1.4 GHz from FIRST and
NVSS. We find that there is a significant flat spectrum population present in
the 10C sample which is missing from the samples selected at 1.4 GHz. The 10C
sample is compared to a sample of sources selected from the SKADS Simulated Sky

observed spectral index distribution and significantly underpredicts the number
of sources in the faintest flux density bin. It is likely that the observed
faint, flat spectrum sources are a result of the cores of FRI sources becoming
dominant at high frequencies. These results highlight the importance of

massless bound-state formalism, which constitutes the general framework for the
systematic implementation of the Schwinger mechanism in non-Abelian gauge
theories. The main ingredient of this formalism is the dynamical formation of
bound-states with vanishing mass, which give rise to effective vertices
containing massless poles; these latter vertices, in turn, trigger the
Schwinger mechanism, and allow for the gauge-invariant generation of an
effective gluon mass. This particular approach has the conceptual advantage of
relating the gluon mass directly to quantities that are intrinsic to the
bound-state formation itself, such as the ""transition amplitude"" and the
corresponding ""bound-state wave-function"". As a result, the dynamical evolution
of the gluon mass is largely determined by a Bethe-Salpeter equation that
controls the dynamics of the relevant wave-function, rather than the
Schwinger-Dyson equation of the gluon propagator, as happens in the standard
treatment. The precise structure and field-theoretic properties of the
transition amplitude are scrutinized in a variety of independent ways. In
particular, a parallel study within the linear covariant (Landau) gauge and the
background-field method reveals that a powerful identity, known to be valid at
the level of conventional Green's functions, relates also the background and
quantum transition amplitudes. Despite the differences in the ingredients and
terminology employed, the massless bound-state formalism is absolutely
equivalent to the standard approach based on Schwinger-Dyson equations. In
fact, a set of powerful relations allow one to demonstrate the exact
coincidence of the integral equations governing the momentum evolution of the
gluon mass in both frameworks.

decay or interact with each other freely. Using the repulsive nature of gravity
at short distances which was obtained by the present author as quantum
corrections to gravity, the particles produced by the decays or interactions of

our observation. It is suggested that the recently observed gamma ray peak at

and $\boldsymbol{x}$, of length $L$ from their circular convolution. We make
the structural assumption that the two vectors are members of known subspaces,
one with dimension $N$ and the other with dimension $K$. Although the observed
convolution is nonlinear in both $\boldsymbol{w}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}$, it is
linear in the rank-1 matrix formed by their outer product
$\boldsymbol{w}\boldsymbol{x}^*$. This observation allows us to recast the
deconvolution problem as low-rank matrix recovery problem from linear
measurements, whose natural convex relaxation is a nuclear norm minimization
program.
  We prove the effectiveness of this relaxation by showing that for ""generic""
signals, the program can deconvolve $\boldsymbol{w}$ and $\boldsymbol{x}$
exactly when the maximum of $N$ and $K$ is almost on the order of $L$. That is,
we show that if $\boldsymbol{x}$ is drawn from a random subspace of dimension
$N$, and $\boldsymbol{w}$ is a vector in a subspace of dimension $K$ whose
basis vectors are ""spread out"" in the frequency domain, then nuclear norm
minimization recovers $\boldsymbol{w}\boldsymbol{x}^*$ without error.
  We discuss this result in the context of blind channel estimation in
communications. If we have a message of length $N$ which we code using a random
$L\times N$ coding matrix, and the encoded message travels through an unknown
linear time-invariant channel of maximum length $K$, then the receiver can
recover both the channel response and the message when $L\gtrsim N+K$, to
within constant and log factors.

  temperature","16 pages, 7 figures, submitted to JCAP",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine the near collapse dynamics of a self-gravitating magnetized
electron gas at finite temperature, taken as the source of a Bianchi-I
spacetime described by the Kasner metric. The set of Einstein-Maxwell field
equations reduces to a complete and self-consistent system of non-linear
autonomous ODE's. By considering a representative set of initial conditions,
the numerical solutions of this system show the gas collapsing into both,
isotropic (""point--like"") and anisotropic (""cigar-like"") singularities,
depending on the intensity of the magnetic field. We also examined the behavior
during the collapse stage of all relevant state and kinematic variables: the
temperature, the expansion scalar, the magnetic field, the magnetization and
energy density. We notice a significant qualitative difference in the behavior
of the gas for a range of temperatures between the values
$\hbox{T}\sim10^{3}\hbox{K}$ and $\hbox{T}\sim 10^{7}\hbox{K}$.

  sector of the Universe","6 pages",,,,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new weak-isospin triplet of scalar bosons is introduced to the Standard
Model in order to ensure the electroweak symmetry for a conjectured new weak
coupling between a hidden sector of the Universe, responsible for cold dark
matter, and the Standard-Model sector (involving now the new triplet). The
considered coupling may be called ""electroweak portal"" to the structure of
hidden sector. After spontaneously breaking the electroweak symmetry by the
Standard-Model Higgs mechanism, it includes the so called ""photonic portal""
introduced by us previously.

(HDE) in the framework of $f(G)$ modified gravity. For this purpose, we
construct $f(G)$ model with the inclusion of HDE and a well-known power law
form of the scale factor $a(t)$. The reconstructed $f(G)$ is found to satisfy a
sufficient condition for a realistic modified gravity model. We find
quintessence behavior of effective equation of state (EoS) parameter
$\omega_{DE}$ through energy conditions in this context. Also, we observe that
the squared speed of sound $v_s^2$ remains negative which shows the instability
of HDE $f(G)$ model.

the distance from circle's center to its perimeter, the ""circumferential
radius"" R_2 which is the length of the perimeter divided by 2 pi and the
""curvature radius"" R_3 which is circle's curvature radius in the Frenet sense.
In the flat Euclidean geometry it is R_1 = R_2 = R_3, but in a curved space
these three radii are different. I show that although Newton's dynamics uses
Euclidean geometry, its equations that describe circular motion in spherical
gravity always unambiguously refer to one particular radius of the three ---
geodesic, circumferential, or curvature. For example, the gravitational force
is given by F = -GMm/(R_2)^2, and the centrifugal force by mv^2/R_3. Building
on this, I derive a Newtonian formula for the perihelion of Mercury advance.
