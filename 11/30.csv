the entire solar disk erupted on 2010 December 6. Prior to the eruption, the
filament in the active region part splits into two layers: a lower layer and an
elevated layer. The eruption occurs in several episodes. Around 14:12 UT, the
lower layer of the active region filament breaks apart, one part ejects towards
the west, while the other part ejects towards the east, which leads to the
explosive eruption of the eastern quiescent filament. During the early rise
phase, part of the quiescent filament sheet displays strong rolling motion
(observed by STEREO$\_$B) in the clockwise direction (views from east to west)
around the filament axis. This rolling motion appears to start from the border
of the active region, then propagates towards the east. AIA observes another
type of rotating motion: in some other parts of the erupting quiescent
prominence the vertical threads turn horizontal, then turn upside down. The
elevated active region filament does not erupt until 18:00 UT, when the
erupting quiescent filament already reaches a very large height. We develop two
simplified three-dimensional models which qualitatively reproduce the observed
rolling and rotating motions. The prominence in the models is assumed to
consist of a collection of discrete blobs that are tied to particular field
lines of a helical flux rope. The observed rolling motion is reproduced by
continuous twist injection into the flux rope in Model 1 from the active region
side. Asymmetric reconnection induced by the asymmetric distribution of the
magnetic fields on the two sides of the filament may cause the observed rolling
motion. The rotating motion of the prominence threads observed by AIA is
consistent with the removal of the field line dips in Model 2 from the top down
during the eruption.

In environments where GT transitions are unfavored, first-forbidden transitions

due to the phase-space amplification for these transitions. In this work the

relative ease with which ALMA can detect the [CII] emission from lower star

clear velocity gradient across the SMG, possibly indicating rotation or a more

quasar spectrum and images for a possible outflow toward the southwest, as well
as more extended emission (a 'bridge'), between the quasar and the SMG,

Polarimeter attached to the German Vacuum Tower Telescope. We recorded a time
sequence of spectra with 34 s cadence placing the slit of the spectrograph
almost parallel to the solar limb and crossing two feet of an intermediate
size, quiescent hedgerow prominence. The data show opposite Doppler shifts, +/-
6 km/s, at the edges of the prominence feet. We argue that these shifts may be
interpreted as prominence plasma rotating counterclockwise around the vertical
axis to the solar surface as viewed from above. The evolution of the prominence
seen in EUV images taken with the Solar Dynamic Observatory provided us clues
to interpret the results as swirling motions. Moreover, time-distance images
taken far from the central wavelength show plasma structures moving parallel to
the solar limb with velocities of about 10-15 km/s. Finally, the shapes of the
observed intensity profiles suggest the presence of, at least, two components
at some locations at the edges of the prominence feet. One of them is typically
Doppler shifted (up to 20 km/s) with respect to the other, thus suggesting the
existence of supersonic counter-streaming flows along the line-of-sight.

messages even in the presence of a decryption oracle, has become the defacto
notion of security for public-key encryption under active attack. In this
manuscript, for the first time, we propose a new approach for constructing
post-quantum cryptosystems secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack
(CCA2-secure) in the standard model using the knapsack problem. The
computational version of the knapsack problem is NP-hard. Thus, this problem is
expected to be difficult to solve using quantum computers. Our construction is
a precoding-based encryption algorithm and uses the knapsack problem to perform
a permutation and pad some random fogged data to the message bits. Compared to
other approaches were introduced today, our approach is very simple and more
efficient.

proportional to the angular velocity even in the scalar-tensor gravity. We also
show that one can observe the spontaneous scalarization in rotational effects
as well as the other stellar properties, if the cosmological value of scalar
field is zero. On the other hand, if the cosmological value of scalar field is
nonzero, the deviation from the general relativity can be seen in a wide range
of the coupling constant. Additionally, we find that the deviation from the
general relativity becomes larger with more massive stellar models, which is
independent of the cosmological value of scalar field. Thus, via precise
observations of astronomical phenomena associated with rotating relativistic
stars, one may be possible to probe not only the gravitational theory in the
strong-field regime, but also the existence of scalar field.

Funke","A framework for the automation of generalised stability theory","Accepted in SISC",,,,"cs.MS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The traditional approach to investigating the stability of a physical system
is to linearise the equations about a steady base solution, and to examine the
eigenvalues of the linearised operator. Over the past several decades, it has
been recognised that this approach only determines the asymptotic stability of
the system, and neglects the possibility of transient perturbation growth
arising due to the nonnormality of the system. This observation motivated the
development of a more powerful generalised stability theory (GST), which
focusses instead on the singular value decomposition of the linearised
propagator of the system. While GST has had significant successes in
understanding the stability of phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics, its
more widespread applicability has been hampered by the fact that computing the
SVD requires both the tangent linear operator and its adjoint: deriving the
tangent linear and adjoint models is usually a considerable challenge, and
manually embedding them inside an eigensolver is laborious. In this paper, we
present a framework for the automation of generalised stability theory, which
overcomes these difficulties. Given a compact high-level symbolic
representation of a finite element discretisation implemented in the FEniCS
system, efficient C++ code is automatically generated to assemble the forward,
tangent linear and adjoint models; these models are then used to calculate the
optimally growing perturbations to the forward model, and their growth rates.
By automating the stability computations, we hope to make these powerful tools
a more routine part of computational analysis. The efficiency and generality of
the framework is demonstrated with applications drawn from geophysical fluid
dynamics, phase separation and quantum mechanics.

sensitive method to detect ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos. Energetic
cosmic neutrinos can interact inside the rock and produce leptons via a charged
current interaction. In the case of an incoming electron neutrino undergoing a
charged current interaction, the produced UHE electron will induce an
underground electromagnetic shower. At high energy (above 7.7 TeV in standard
rock), such showers are subject to LPM (Landau, Pomeranchuk and Migdal)
suppression of the radiative processes cross sections (bremsstrahlung and pair
production). The consequence of this suppression is that showers are elongated.
This effect will increase the detection probability of such events allowing
deeper showers to emerge with detectable energies. On the other hand, the
photonuclear processes which are usually neglected in electromagnetic showers
with respect to radiative processes, turn out to become dominant in the LPM
regime and will reduce the shower length. In this work, we have performed a
complete Monte Carlo study of an underground shower induced by UHE electrons by
taking into account both the LPM suppression and the photonuclear interaction.
We will discuss the effects of both of these processes on the shower length and
on the detectability of such events by ground arrays or fluorescence
telescopes. We show that limits on neutrino fluxes that were obtained using
simulations that were obviously neglecting photonuclear processes are
overoptimistic and should be corrected.

dependence on the transition rate and limited control of external parameters so
far prevented tests of KZM scaling. As recently predicted [5-9], in
inhomogeneous systems propagation of the critical front enhances the role of
causality and steepens scaling of defect density with the transition rate. We
use ion Coulomb crystals in a harmonic trap to demonstrate, for the first time,
scaling of the number of topological defects with the transition rate - the
central prediction of KZM - in a well-controlled environment.

that detailed modeling of reionization is not necessary for the purpose of

the Higgs in this invisible channel for both choices of the LHC energies, 8 and
14 TeV, for two production channels; vector boson fusion(VBF) and associated
production($ZH$). In the latter case we consider decays of the $Z$ boson into a
pair of leptons as well as a $b \bar b$ pair. For the VBF channel the
sensitivity is found to be more than $5 \sigma$ at both the energies up to an
invisible branching ratio ${\cal B}r_{invis} \sim 0.80$, with luminosities
$\sim 20/30 {\rm fb}^{-1}$. The sensitivity is further extended to values of
${\cal B}r_{invis} \sim 0.25$ for $300 {\rm fb}^{-1}$ at 14 TeV. However the
reach is found to be more modest for the $ZH$ mode with leptonic final state;
with about $3.5 \sigma$ for the planned luminosity at 8 TeV, reaching $8
\sigma$ only for 14 TeV for $50 {\rm fb}^{-1}$. In spite of the much larger
branching ratio of the $Z$ into a $b \bar b$ channel compared to the dilepton
case, the former channel, can provide useful reach upto ${\cal B}r_{invis}

Hubbard Hamiltonian. In this effective theory, renormalized hopping and
interaction parameters only implicitly incorporate the coupling of correlated
charge carriers to microscopic degrees of freedom. Unfortunately, no
spectroscopy can individually probe such renormalizations, limiting the
applicability of Hubbard models. We show here that the role of each individual
degree of freedom can be made explicit by using a new experimental technique,
which we term 'quantum modulation spectroscopy' and we demonstrate here in the
one-dimensional Mott insulator ET-F2TCNQ. We explore the role on the charge
hopping of two localized molecular modes, which we drive with a mid infrared
optical pulse. Sidebands appear in the modulated optical spectrum, and their
linshape is fitted with a model based on the dynamic Hubbard Hamiltonian. A
striking asymmetry between the renormalization of doublons and holons is
revealed. The concept of quantum modulation spectroscopy can be used to
systematically deconstruct Hubbard Hamiltonians in many materials, exposing the
role of any mode, electronic or magnetic, that can be driven to large amplitude
with a light field.

initial conditions in a de Sitter vacuum with arbitrarily large entropy can be
compatible with the observed arrow of time, if the causal patch or related
measures are used to regulate divergences. An important condition, however, is
that the initial vacuum cannot produce observers from rare fluctuations
(Boltzmann brains). Here we consider more general initial conditions where
multiple vacua have nonzero initial probability. We examine whether the
prediction of an arrow of time is destroyed by a small initial admixture of
vacua that can produce Boltzmann brains. We identify general criteria and apply
them to two nontrivial examples of such initial probability distributions. The
Hartle-Hawking state is superexponentially dominated by the vacuum with
smallest positive cosmological constant, so one might expect that other initial
vacua can be neglected; but in fact, their inclusion drastically narrows the
range of theory parameters for which an arrow of time is predicted. The
dominant eigenvector of the global rate equation of eternal inflation is
dominated by the longest-lived metastable vacuum. If an arrow of time emerges
in the single-initial-vacuum approximation, then we find that this conclusion
survives the admixture of other initial vacua. By global-local measure duality,
this result amounts to a successful consistency test of certain global cutoffs,
including light-cone time and scale-factor time.

medium partons, the Bose-Einstein symmetry with respect to the interchange of
the exchanged bosons leads to a destructive interference of the amplitudes in
most regions of the phase space but a constructive interference in some other
regions. As a consequence, there is a collective longitudinal momentum transfer
to the scatterers along the jet direction, each scatterer carrying a
substantial fraction of the incident jet longitudinal momentum. The
manifestation of the Bose-Einstein interference may have been observed in
angular correlations of hadrons associated with a high-p_T trigger in
high-energy collisions at RHIC and LHC.

intestine, started in a previous article, by investigating the effects of
dietary fibre. We recall that this model aims at taking into account the three
main phenomena of the digestion, namely the transit of the bolus, the
degradation of feedstuffs and the absorption through the intestinal wall. In
order to study the role of dietary fibre on digestion, we model their two
principal physiochemical characteristics which interact with the function of
the small intestine, i.e. viscosity and water holding capacity. This leads us
to consider some features of digestion which have not been taken into account
previously, in particular the interrelationship between the evolution of dry
matter and water in the bolus. The numerical results are in agreement with the
positive effect of insoluble dietary fibre on the velocity of bolus along the
small intestine and on its degradation. These results highlight the negative
effect of soluble dietary fibre on digestion. Although, this model is generic
and contains a large number of parameters, to our knowledge, it is among the
first qualitative dynamical modelling of fibre influence on intestinal
digestion.

et al. 2012) combined with the determination of its gravity field by MESSENGER
(Smith et al. 2012) give clues on the internal structure of Mercury, in
particular its polar moment of inertia C, deduced from the obliquity (2.04 +/-
0.08) arcmin.
  The dynamics of the obliquity of Mercury is a very-long term motion (a few
hundreds of kyrs), based on the regressional motion of Mercury's orbital
ascending node. This paper, following the study of Noyelles & D'Hoedt (2012),
aims at first giving initial conditions at any time and for any values of the
internal structure parameters for numerical simulations, and at using them to
estimate the influence of usually neglected parameters on the obliquity, like
J3, the Love number k2 and the secular variations of the orbital elements. We
use for that averaged representations of the orbital and rotational motions of
Mercury, suitable for long-term studies.
  We find that J3 should alter the obliquity by 250 milli-arcsec, the tides by
100 milli-arcsec, and the secular variations of the orbital elements by 10
milli-arcsec over 20 years. The resulting value of C could be at the most
changed from 0.346mR^2 to 0.345mR^2.

an indispensable tool in quantum science for preparing, manipulating, and
detecting quantum states of light, atoms, and other quantum systems. Here we
experimentally perform rapid optical quantum-noise-limited measurements of the

much shorter than a period of mechanical motion. Using this back-action evading
interaction we performed both state preparation and full state tomography of
the mechanical motional state. We have reconstructed mechanical states with a
position uncertainty reduced to 19 pm, limited by the quantum fluctuations of
the optical pulse, and we have performed `cooling-by-measurement' to reduce the
mechanical mode temperature from an initial 1100 K to 16 K. Future improvements
to this technique may allow for quantum squeezing of mechanical motion, even
from room temperature, and reconstruction of non-classical states exhibiting
negative regions in their phase-space quasi-probability distribution.

twin signal recycling was proposed as an alternative to conventional detuned
signal recycling. Twin signal recycling features the narrow-band sensitivity
gain of conventional detuned signal recycling but furthermore facilitates the
injection of squeezed states of light, increases the detector sensitivity over
a wide frequency band and requires a less complex detection scheme for optimal

that $\mathcal{S}$ is $\mathcal{H}^{N-1}$-rectifiable with positive
$\mathcal{H}^{N-1}$-measure. Second, we consider a class of control-affine
\textit{planar} nonlinear systems satisfying a second order controllability
condition: we characterize the set $\mathcal{S}$ in a neighborhood of the

known to have epigraph with positive reach, hence to be a locally $BV$ function

DNP is built up due to a competition between hyperfine (HF) spin-flip
transitions and another inelastic escape mechanism from the triplets, which
block transport. We focus on the temperature dependence of the DNP for zero
energy-detuning (i.e. equal electrostatic energy of one electron in each dot
and a singlet in the right dot). Our main result is the existence of a
transition temperature, below which the DNP is bistable, so a hysteretic
leakage current versus external magnetic field B appears. This is studied in
two cases: (i) Close to the crossing of the three triplet energy levels near
B=0, where spin-blockade is lifted due to the inhomogeneity of the effective
magnetic field from the nuclei. (ii) At higher B-fields, where the two
spin-polarized triplets simultaneously cross two different singlet energy
levels. We develop simplified models leading to different transition
temperatures T_TT and T_ST for the crossing of the triplet levels and the
singlet-triplet level crossings, respectively. We find T_TT analytically to be
given solely by the HF couplings, whereas T_ST depends on various parameters
and T_ST>T_TT. The key idea behind the existence of the transition temperatures
at zero energy-detuning is the suppression of energy absorption compared to
emission in the inelastic HF transitions. Finally, by comparing the rate
equation results with Monte Carlo simulations, we discuss the importance of
having both HF interaction and another escape mechanism from the triplets to
induce a finite DNP.

solved via semidefinite relaxation. In order to prevent artificial clustering
of the estimated viewing directions, we further introduce a spectral norm term
that is added as a constraint or as a regularization term to the relaxed
minimization problem. The resulted problems are solved by using either the
alternating direction method of multipliers or an iteratively reweighted least
squares procedure. Numerical experiments with both simulated and real images
demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly reduce the orientation
estimation error when the detection rate of common-lines is low.

emission, extending for >40kpc from the brightest cluster galaxy. We observe an
underlying, diffuse population of old stars, following an r^1/4 distribution,
confirming that this system is somewhat relaxed. The spectral energy
distribution in the inner part of the galaxy, as well as along the extended
filaments, is a smooth continuum and is consistent with that of a star-forming
galaxy, suggesting that the extended, filamentary emission is not due to the
central AGN, either from a large-scale ionized outflow or scattered polarized
UV emission, but rather a massive population of young stars. We estimate an
extinction-corrected star formation rate of 798 +/- 42 Msun/yr, consistent with
our earlier work based on low spatial resolution ultraviolet, optical, and
infrared imaging. The lack of tidal features and multiple bulges, combine with
the need for an exceptionally massive (>10^11 Msun) cold gas reservoir, suggest
that this star formation is not the result of a merger of gas-rich galaxies.
Instead, we propose that the high X-ray cooling rate of ~2700 Msun/yr is the
origin of the cold gas reservoir. The combination of such a high cooling rate
and the relatively weak radio source in the cluster core suggests that feedback
has been unable to halt cooling in this system, leading to this tremendous

galaxies, globular clusters and streams of disrupted systems. Together, these
form a vast polar structure (VPOS), a thin plane spreading to Galactocentric
distances as large as 250 kpc. The orbital directions of satellite galaxies and
the preferred alignment of streams with the VPOS demonstrate that the objects
orbit within the structure. This strong phase-space correlation is at odds with
the expectations from simulations of structure formation based on the cold dark
matter cosmology (LCDM). The accretion of sub-halos along filaments has been
suggested as the origin of the anisotropic distribution. We have tested this
scenario using the results of high-resolution cosmological simulations and
found it unable to account for the large degree of correlation of the MW
satellite orbits. It is therefore advisable to search for alternative
explanations. The formation of tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) in the debris
expelled from interacting galaxies is a very natural formation scenario of the
VPOS. If a number of MW satellites truly are TDGs, mistakenly interpreting them
to trace the dark-matter sub-structure of the MW halo would significantly
enhance the 'small-scale' problems which are already known to plague the LCDM
model.

is an unlikely explanation for the good alignment observed today, because
realignment happens on the same timescale as spin-orbit synchronization, and
the stars in EP Cru are far from syncrhonization (they are spinning 9 times too
quickly). Therefore it seems that some binaries form with aligned axes, while

moment compared to Sr2IrO4, questioning the validity of such hypothesis. To
understand the microscopic mechanism for magnetism in Sr3Ir2O7, we construct a

smaller than Sr2IrO4, originated from the underlying band structure of a barely
band insulator. Given the small charge gap and moment observed in Sr3Ir2O7, the

long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) is not intrinsic to their formation, but
rather a consequence of the anti-correlation between star-formation and
metallicity seen in the general galaxy population. To investigate this
proposal, we compare the metallicity of the hosts of LGRBs, broad-lined Type Ic
(Ic-bl) supernovae (SNe), and Type II SNe to each other and to the metallicity
distribution of star-forming galaxies using the SDSS to represent galaxies in
the local universe and the TKRS for galaxies at intermediate redshifts.
  The differing metallicity distributions of the LGRB hosts and the star
formation in local galaxies forces us to conclude that the low-metallicity
preference of LGRBs is not primarily driven by the anti-correlation between
star-formation and metallicity, but rather must be overwhelmingly due to the
astrophysics of the LGRBs themselves. Three quarters of our LGRB sample are
found at metallicities below 12+log(O/H) < 8.6, while less than a tenth of
local star-formation is at similarly low metallicities. However, our SN samples
are statistically consistent with the metallicity distribution of the general
galaxy population. Using the TKRS population of galaxies, we are able to
exclude the possibility that the LGRB host metallicity aversion is caused by
the decrease in galaxy metallicity with redshift. The presence of the strong
metallicity difference between LGRBs and Ic-bl SNe largely eliminates the
possibility that the observed LGRB metallicity bias is a byproduct of a
difference in the initial mass functions of the galaxy populations. Rather,
metallicity below half-solar must be a fundamental component of the
evolutionary process that separates LGRBs from the vast majority of Ic-bl SNe
and from the bulk of local star-formation.

of the neutrino mass hierarchy and whether the neutrino velocity is super or

providing a powerful constraint on the dynamics of quantum gravity. Such

has the dangerous potential to be violent to generic infalling observers, this
paper proposes the existence of a more innocuous form of information transfer,
to relatively soft modes in the black hole atmosphere. Simplified models for
such nonlocal transfer are described and parameterized, within a possibly more
basic framework of a Hilbert tensor network. Sufficiently sensitive
measurements by infalling observers may detect departures from Hawking's
predictions, and in generic models black holes decay more rapidly. Constraints
of consistency -- internally and with known and expected features of physics --
restrict the form of information transfer, and should provide important guides
to discovery of the principles and mechanisms of the more fundamental nonlocal
mechanics.

information from proper-motion measurements for high Galactic latitude stars in
our sample. We find that stars with retrograde rotation in the rest frame of
the Galaxy are generally more metal poor than those exhibiting prograde
rotation, which is consistent with earlier arguments by Carollo et al. that the
halo system comprises at least two spatially overlapping components with
differing metallicity, kinematics, and spatial distributions. The observed
photometric metallicity distribution and that of Ryan & Norris can be described
by a simple chemical evolution model by Hartwick (or by a single Gaussian
distribution); however, the suggestive metallicity-kinematic correlation
contradicts the basic assumption in this model that the Milky Way halo consists
primarily of a single stellar population. When the observed metallicity
distribution is deconvolved using two Gaussian components with peaks at [Fe/H]
~ -1.7 and -2.3, the metal-poor component accounts for ~20% - 35% of the entire

field can be treated as a probe field whose backreaction to both the metric and
the gauge field can be ignored. We show that when the chemical potential of the

geometry is a AdS soliton with a constant gauge field, while the complex scalar
condenses leading to broken symmetry. We then turn on a time dependent source
for the order parameter which interpolates between constant values and crosses
the order-disorder critical point. In the critical region adiabaticity breaks
down, but for a small rate of change of the source $v$ there is a new small-$v$
expansion in fractional powers of $v$. The resulting critical dynamics is
dominated by a zero mode of the bulk field. To lowest order in this small-$v$

equation which has $z=2$, but non-dissipative. These predictions are verified

>5Gyr, we assume that simulated halos at z=2 (z2-halo) are progenitors for
LRG-host subhalos observed today, and we label the most tightly bound particles
in each progenitor z2-halo as LRG ``stars''. We then identify the subhalos
containing these stars to z=0.3 (SDSS redshift) in descending order of the
masses of z2-halos until the comoving number density of the matched subhalos
becomes comparable to the measured number density of SDSS LRGs, n=10^{-4}
(h/Mpc)^3. Once the above prescription is determined, our only free parameter
is the number density of halos identified at z=2 and this parameter is fixed to
match the observed number density at z = 0.3. By tracing subsequent merging and
assembly histories of each progenitor z2-halo, we can directly compute, from
the mock catalog, the distributions of central and satellite LRGs and their
internal motions in each host halo at z=0.3. While the SDSS LRGs are galaxies
selected by the magnitude and color cuts from the SDSS images and are not

overall phase difference but not the details of the ramp. The entanglement
entropy does not increase when the QSSC lasts. Due to different spin
statistics, condensed non-interacting bosons do not support a finite QSSC under

the Cen A radio lobes. The JF12 model predictions are in excellent agreement
with the observations, justifying confidence in its predictions for deflections
of UHECRs from Cen A. We find that up to six of the 69 Auger events above 55
EeV are consistent with originating in Cen A and being deflected <18 degrees;
in this case three are protons and three have Z=2-4. Others of the 13 events
within 18 degrees must have another origin. In order for a random extragalactic
magnetic field between Cen A and the Milky Way to appreciably alter these
conclusions, its strength would have to be > ~ 80 nG -- far larger than
normally imagined.

We examine both the combinatorial and homological properties of this structure

we show that over any field of characteristic 2 the existence of non-zero

$d$-dimensional cycles which are orientable give rise to non-zero simplicical

penalties might induce better sparsity than convex ones, but up until now those
corresponding non-convex algorithms lack convergence guarantees from the
initial solution to the global optimum. This paper aims to provide performance
guarantees of a non-convex approach for sparse recovery. Specifically, the
concept of weak convexity is incorporated into a class of sparsity-inducing
penalties to characterize the non-convexity. Borrowing the idea of the
projected subgradient method, an algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex
optimization problem. In addition, a uniform approximate projection is adopted
in the projection step to make this algorithm computationally tractable for
large scale problems. The convergence analysis is provided in the noisy
scenario. It is shown that if the non-convexity of the penalty is below a
threshold (which is in inverse proportion to the distance between the initial
solution and the sparse signal), the recovered solution has recovery error
linear in both the step size and the noise term. Numerical simulations are
implemented to test the performance of the proposed approach and verify the
theoretical analysis.

is to realize a spin coherence time that is much longer than the time for
quantum spin manipulation protocols. Here we demonstrate an improvement of more
than two orders of magnitude in the spin coherence time ($T_2$) of NV centers
compared to previous measurements: $T_2 \approx 0.5$ s at 77 K, which enables
$\sim 10^7$ coherent NV spin manipulations before decoherence. We employed
dynamical decoupling pulse sequences to suppress NV spin decoherence due to
magnetic noise, and found that $T_2$ is limited to approximately half of the
longitudinal spin relaxation time ($T_1$) over a wide range of temperatures,
which we attribute to phonon-induced decoherence. Our results apply to
ensembles of NV spins and do not depend on the optimal choice of a specific NV,
which could advance quantum sensing, enable squeezing and many-body

that singular value decomposition (SVD) can be used to reduce the number of

its removal of biases from the phenomenological templates along with a
corresponding improvement in their ability to represent waveform signals

present a method that calibrates a reduced SVD basis of phenomenological
waveforms against NR waveforms in order to construct a new waveform approximant
with improved accuracy and faithfulness compared to the original

the interpolation of the projection coefficients of NR waveforms expanded onto

NLR extends over 26x44 kpc and is surrounded by an extended narrow-line region
(ENLR). With a total [OIII]5008 luminosity of (5.7+/-0.9)x10e43 erg/s, this is
one of the most luminous NLR known around any type-2 galaxy. Using VLT/XSHOOTER
we show that the NLR is powered by an AGN, and we derive resolved extinction,

high velocity outflows are absent or faint. This NLR is unlike any other NLR or

reveals extended, high luminosity [OIII] emission also in other GBs. WISE
24micron luminosities are 5-50 times lower than predicted by the [OIII] fluxes,

Langevin force as a fluctuating force in the absence of the atomic population
inversion and dipole moment Langevin forces. The temporal fluctuations induced
to the phase and amplitude of the cavity electric field and the atomic

Our aim is to derive correlation functions for the fluctuating variables of the
cavity electric field and the atomic population inversion to determine the
noise fluxes emerging from the cavity mirrors and measured by an optical
detector and those radiated in the form of spontaneous emission in all spatial

magnetic field deviates from a potential one. We show that the linear MHD modes
excited on top of the non-potential magnetic field possess a nonzero kinetic
helicity. Accordingly, this necessarily results in a noticeable kinetic
helicity of the turbulence, composed of these linear modes with various scales
and random phases, generated at the flare site by the primary energy release,
which may be important for many applications. In particular, a nonzero
turbulence helicity has a potentially strong effect on the particle
acceleration because the helical component of the turbulence induces a mean
regular large-scale (DC) electric field capable of directly accelerating the
charged particles in addition to the commonly considered stochastic turbulent
electric field. In this paper, we derive the kinetic helicity density of the
linear MHD modes excited on top of a twisted large-scale magnetic field,
estimate the corresponding turbulence helicity and take its effect on
stochastic particle acceleration by the turbulence into consideration; in
particular, we compare this induced mean electric field with the electron and
estimated effective ion Dreicer fields. We have discovered that this, so far
missing but highly important, ingredient of the turbulence at the flare site
can be responsible for the thermal-to-nonthermal energy partition in flares by
controlling the process of particle extraction from the thermal pool and
formation of the seed particle population to be then stochastically accelerated
to higher energies. In addition, it is naturally consistent with such puzzling
flare manifestations as spatial separation of electron and proton emission
sites, electron beam formation, and enrichment of the accelerated particle
population by $^3He$ and other rare ions.

challenged. This has been attributed to the rapid and complex technology
migration compounded with rigorous regulatory requirements and ever increasing
capital expenditures. These trends, combined together with the increasing
competition, rapid commoditization of telecommunication equipments and rising
separation of network and service provisioning are pushing the operators to
adopt multiple strategies, with network infrastructure sharing in the core and
radio access networks emerging as a more radical mechanism to substantially and
sustainably improve network costs. Through infrastructure sharing, developing
countries and other emerging economies can harness the technological, market
and regulatory developments that have fostered affordable access to mobile and
broadband services. Similarly, the network operators entering or consolidating
in the emerging markets can aim for substantial savings on capital and
operating expenses. The present paper aims to investigate the current

convolution. We construct a wavelet estimator of $f$, derive minimax lower
bounds for the $L^2$-risk when $f$ belongs to a Besov ball of mixed smoothness
and demonstrate that the wavelet estimator is adaptive and asymptotically
near-optimal within a logarithmic factor, in a wide range of Besov balls. We
prove in particular that choosing this type of mixed smoothness leads to rates
of convergence which are free of the ""curse of dimensionality"" and, hence, are
higher than usual convergence rates when $r$ is large. The problem studied in
the paper is motivated by seismic inversion which can be reduced to solution of
noisy two-dimensional convolution equations that allow to draw inference on
underground layer structures along the chosen profiles. The common practice in
seismology is to recover layer structures separately for each profile and then
to combine the derived estimates into a two-dimensional function. By studying
the two-dimensional version of the model, we demonstrate that this strategy
usually leads to estimators which are less accurate than the ones obtained as
two-dimensional functional deconvolutions. Indeed, we show that unless the
function $f$ is very smooth in the direction of the profiles, very spatially
inhomogeneous along the other direction and the number of profiles is very
limited, the functional deconvolution solution has a much better precision
compared to a combination of $M$ solutions of separate convolution equations. A
limited simulation study in the case of $r=1$ confirms theoretical claims of
the paper.

positive effect on the molecular gas fraction. Averaged over the full SGS

created the shells. This corresponds to ~4-11% of the total molecular mass of
the galaxy. These figures are an approximate lower limit to the total

Although the three active massive neutrino framework with the Standard Model
(SM), so-called the neutrino Standard Model (nuSM), is successful, series of
signals not understood within the nuSM suggest neutrino physics may be the
first place to see the physics beyond the SM, such as Lorentz violation.
Especially, neutrino oscillations are the natural interferometer and they are
sensitive to the Lorentz violation.
  The LSND oscillation signal was analyzed under the Standard Model Extension
(SME) framework, and it was found that the oscillation data was consistent with
no Lorentz violation, but data cannot reject Lorentz violation hypothesis with
order ~10^{-17}. By assuming LSND signal was due to the Lorentz violation, a
global phenomenological model was made to describe all known oscillation data
including the LSND signal. The model also predicted the signal for MiniBooNE at
the low energy region.
  Later, MiniBooNE announced an event excess at the low energy region. However,
the oscillation candidate signals from MiniBooNE were consistent with no
Lorentz violation. The limit obtained by MiniBooNE and MINOS on the e-mu sector
reject the simple scenario to explain LSND signal with Lorentz violation.
  Meantime, MINOS and IceCube set tight limits on the mu-tau sector Lorentz
violation. The last untested channel, the e-tau Lorentz violating mixing, was
tested using reactor disappearance data from Double Chooz. However, Double
Chooz data was consistent with flat, and sidereal time dependent Lorentz
violation hypothesis is rejected. Combinations of all oscillation data from
LSND, MiniBooNE, MINOS, IceCube, and Double Chooz provide very tight constraint
for a possible Lorentz violation in the neutrino sector in terrestrial level.

related to how it is heated. Mechanisms based on ion-cyclotron resonance have
been successful in explaining a large number of observations, those concerning
the significant ion temperature anisotropy above coronal holes in particular.
However, they suffer from the inconsistency with turbulence theory which says
that the turbulent cascade in a low-beta medium like the solar corona should
proceed in the perpendicular rather than the parallel direction, meaning that
there is little energy in the ion gyro-frequency range for ions to absorb via
ion-cyclotron resonance. Recently a mechanism based on the interaction between
the solar wind particles and the anisotropic turbulence has been proposed,
where the perpendicular proton energy addition is via the stochastic heating
(Chandran et al. 2011). We extend this promising mechanism by properly
accounting for the effect of proton temperature anisotropy on the propagation
of Alfven waves, for the radiative losses of electron energy, and for the field
line curvature that naturally accompanies solar winds in the corona. While this
mechanism was shown in previous studies to apply to the polar fast solar wind,
we demonstrate here for the first time that it applies also to the slow wind
flowing along field lines bordering streamer helmets.

uniform sampling measurements that are endowed with antipodal symmetry play an
important role when the raw data and image data are related through the Fourier
relationship as in q-space diffusion MRI and 3D radial MRI. Currently, it is
extremely challenging to generate large uniform antipodally symmetric point
sets suitable for 3D radial MRI. A novel approach is proposed to solve this
important and long-standing problem.
  Methods: The proposed method is based upon constrained centroidal Voronoi
tessellations of the upper hemisphere with a novel pseudometric. Geometrically
intuitive approach to tessellating the upper hemisphere is also proposed.
  Results: The average time complexity of the proposed centroidal tessellations
was shown to be effectively on the order of the product of the number of
iterations and the number of generators. For small sample size, the proposed
method was comparable to the state-of-the-art iterative method in terms of the
uniformity. For large sample size, in which the state-of-the-art method is
infeasible, the reconstructed images from the proposed method has less streak
and ringing artifact as compared to those of the commonly used methods.
  Conclusion: This work solved a long-standing problem on generating uniform

central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy. The map extends over approximately
40 arcmin x 8 arcmin (~100x20 pc^2) along the Galactic plane with a linear
resolution of 1.2 pc. The strongest of the three lines, the H_2CO (3_03-2_02)

distribution similar to ammonia. The relative abundance of para-H_2CO is
0.5-1.2 10^{-9}, which is consistent with results from lower frequency H_2CO
absorption lines. Derived gas kinetic temperatures for individual molecular
clouds range from 50 K to values in excess of 100 K. While a systematic trend
toward (decreasing) kinetic temperature versus (increasing) angular distance
from the Galactic center (GC) is not found, the clouds with highest temperature

mean value of 0.35% +/- 0.10% between 8 and 11 microns and increases from 8 to
13 microns. Given the small field of view of the instrument, the source of this
marginal excess must be contained within 2AU of Fomalhaut. This result is
reminiscent of previous VLTI K-band observations, which implied the presence of
a ~ 0.88% excess, and argued that thermal emission from hot dusty grains
located within 6 AU from Fomalhaut was the most plausible explanation. Using a
parametric 2D radiative transfer code and a Bayesian analysis, we examine
different dust disk structures to reproduce both the near and mid-infrared data
simultaneously. While not a definitive explanation of the hot excess of
Fomalhaut, our model suggests that the most likely inner few AU disk geometry
consists of a two-component structure, with two different and spatially
distinct grain populations. The 2 to 11 microns data are consistent with an
inner hot ring of very small (~ 10 to 300 nm) carbon-rich grains concentrating
around 0.1AU. The second dust population consists of larger grains (size of a
few microns to a few tens of microns) located further out in a colder region
where regular astronomical silicates could survive, with an inner edge around
1AU. From a dynamical point of view, the presence of the inner concentration of
sub-micron sized grains is surprising, as such grains should be expelled from
the inner planetary system by radiation pressure within only a few years. This
could either point to some inordinate replenishment rates (e.g. many grazing
comets coming from an outer reservoir) or to the existence of some braking
mechanism preventing the grains from moving out.

satellites challenge our understanding of physics of pulsars and their nebulae.
The central problem is that the peak energy of the flares exceeds the maximum
energy E_{\mathrm{c}} determined by synchrotron radiation loss. However, when
there exist turbulent magnetic fields with scales \lambda_{\mathrm{B}} smaller
than 2\pi mc^2/eB, jitter radiation can emit photons with energy higher than
E_{\mathrm{c}}. The scale required for the Crab flares is about two orders of
magnitude less than the wavelength of the striped wind. We discuss the model in
which the flares are triggered by plunging of the high density blobs into the
termination shock. The observed hard spectral shape may be explained by jitter
mechanism. We make three observational predictions: firstly the polarization
degree will become lower in flares, secondly, no counterpart will be seen in
TeV-PeV range, and thirdly the flare spectrum will not be harder than \nu F_\nu
\propto \nu^1.

the standard model brane live a distance away from the brane on which the

is important in the most efficient, optimal trajectories or pathways for a
protein to fold. This involves recording all unphysical crossing events of a
ghost chain, and calculating the minimal uncrossing cost that would have been
required to avoid such events. A depth-first tree search algorithm is applied
to find minimal transformations to fold $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\alpha/\beta$, and
knotted proteins. In all cases, the extra uncrossing/non-crossing distance is a
small fraction of the total distance travelled by a ghost chain. Different
structural classes may be distinguished by the amount of extra uncrossing
distance, and the effectiveness of such discrimination is compared with other
order parameters. It was seen that non-crossing distance over chain length
provided the best discrimination between structural and kinetic classes. The
scaling of non-crossing distance with chain length implies an inevitable
crossover to entanglement-dominated folding mechanisms for sufficiently long
chains. We further quantify the minimal folding pathways by collecting the
sequence of uncrossing moves, which generally involve leg, loop, and elbow-like
uncrossing moves, and rendering the collection of these moves over the unfolded
ensemble as a multiple-transformation ""alignment"". The consensus minimal
pathway is constructed and shown schematically for representative cases of an
$\alpha$, $\beta$, and knotted protein. An overlap parameter is defined between
pathways; we find that $\alpha$ proteins have minimal overlap indicating
diverse folding pathways, knotted proteins are highly constrained to follow a
dominant pathway, and $\beta$ proteins are somewhere in between. Thus we have
shown how topological chain constraints can induce dominant pathway mechanisms

the algorithmic detection of cohesive groups (i.e., ""communities"") of nodes. In
this paper, we algorithmically detect communities in social networks and image
data by optimizing multislice modularity. A key advantage of modularity
optimization is that it does not require prior knowledge of the number or sizes
of communities, and it is capable of finding network partitions that are
composed of communities of different sizes. By optimizing multislice modularity
and subsequently calculating diagnostics on the resulting network partitions,
it is thereby possible to obtain information about network structure across
multiple system scales. We illustrate this method on data from both social
networks and images, and we find that optimization of multislice modularity
performs well on these two tasks without the need for extensive
problem-specific adaptation. However, improving the computational speed of this
method remains a challenging open problem.

application to a LISA Pathfinder data analysis problem. The two algorithms
share the same heating strategy but with one moving in coordinate directions

the natural logarithm of some parameters and proposes jumps in the eigen-space
of the Fisher Information matrix. The algorithm proposing jumps in the

rate and a slightly better convergence towards the equilibrium parameter
distributions in the application to LISA Pathfinder data . For this experiment,
we return parameter values that are all within $\sim1\sigma$ of the injected

a similar research opportunity. About 10% of cadets are enrolled in this course
each Spring, the 5% who began in Basic Math and matriculate to Calculus 1 and
the 5% who failed Calculus 1 in their first attempt. During the first four
semesters, the program has yielded 22 cadet papers which have been published or
are currently under review and expected to be published. This represents
approximately 38% of the projects in the program, because the majority of the

networks is one of the most important fields in systems biology. The complexity
of these models and their description makes the use of computational tools an

  Results: In this manuscript we present PyNetMet, a Python library of tools to
work with networks and metabolic models. These are open-source free tools for
use in a Python platform, which adds considerably versatility to them when
compared with their desktop software similars. On the other hand these tools
allow one to work with different standards of metabolic models (OptGene and
SBML) and the fact that they are programmed in Python opens the possibility of
efficient integration with any other already existing Python tool.
  Conclusions: PyNetMet is, therefore, a collection of computational tools that
will facilitate the research work with metabolic models and networks.

We outline a method for computing the required potential from first principles

fact, the soft-wall AdS/QCD approach provides a model for the light-front

between the bound-state amplitudes in the fifth dimension of AdS space and the
boost-invariant light-front wavefunctions describing the internal structure of
hadrons in physical space-time. The elastic and transition form factors of the
pion and the nucleons are found to be well described in this framework. The
light-front AdS/QCD holographic approach thus gives a frame-independent first

lowering the solar mixing angle below $\tan^{2}\theta_{12}=0.50$ when charged

violation is absent. We start with a new model which incorporates a new idea of
mixing developed recently, called Bi-Large (BL) mixing, similar to BM mixing
execpt that the former chooses rather $\theta_{13}$ as Cabibbo angle
$(\theta_c)$ than zero. We apply this mixing in the neutrino sector, followed
by a charged lepton correction with the CKM type matrix $U_{l}$. This model
marks a prediction on $\theta_{23}$ to lie within the first octant. The CP
violating phase $\delta_{CP}$ dictates the prediction of all the three mixing
angles. A proper choice of $\delta_{CP}$ leads to the predictions of all the
three mixing angles including $\theta_{12}$, to align very precisely with the
experimental bestfits. This close agreement thus hoists Bi-Large mixing as an
important and promising mixing scheme, in contrast to BM or TBM mixing as a
first approximation. A formal derivation of BL mixing from discrete symmetry
will be an important investigation in neutrino physics.

provided more payoff, hence successfully replaced the mixed classical

numerically in the framework of two essentially different mathematical models,
and the results are compared with experimental data on the very early stages of
the coalescence process reported recently. The first model tested is the
`conventional' one, where it is assumed that coalescence as the formation of a
single body of fluid occurs by an instant appearance of a liquid bridge
smoothly connecting the two drops, and the subsequent process is the evolution
of this single body of fluid driven by capillary forces. The second model under
investigation considers coalescence as a process where a section of the free
surface becomes trapped between the bulk phases as the drops are pressed
against each other, and it is the gradual disappearance of this `internal
interface' that leads to the formation of a single body of fluid and the
conventional model taking over. Using the full numerical solution of the
problem in the framework of each of the two models, we show that the recently
reported electrical measurements probing the very early stages of the process
are better described by the interface formation/disappearance model. New
theory-guided experiments are suggested that would help to further elucidate
the details of the coalescence phenomenon. As a by-product of our research, the
range of validity of different `scaling laws' advanced as approximate solutions
to the problem formulated using the conventional model is established.

results of three-dimensional numerical simulations for the steady locomotion of

number. Locomotion is driven by steady tangential deformation at the surface of
the body (so-called squirming motion). In the case of a spherical squirmer, we
show that the swimming velocity is systematically less than that in a Newtonian
fluid, with a minimum occurring for Weissenberg numbers of order one. The rate
of work done by the swimmer always goes up compared to that occurring in the
Newtonian solvent alone, but is always lower than the power necessary to swim
in a Newtonian fluid with the same viscosity. The swimming efficiency, defined
as the ratio between the rate of work necessary to pull the body at the
swimming speed in the same fluid and the rate of work done by swimming, is
found to always be increased in a polymeric fluid. Further analysis reveals
that polymeric stresses break the Newtonian front-back symmetry in the flow
profile around the body. In particular, a strong negative elastic wake is
present behind the swimmer, which correlates with strong polymer stretching,
and its intensity increases with Weissenberg number and viscosity contrasts.
{The velocity induced by the squirmer is found to decay in space faster than}
in a Newtonian flow, with a strong {dependence} on the polymer relaxation time

decrease of the spin splitting is determined by the formation of Landau levels
and it has no upper limit. Unlike the nonrelativistic limit, the relativistic
spin splitting depends on the Landau levels and decreases for higher Landau
levels, thereby signalling the presence of a Landau ladder red shift effect.

of jump processes on compact ultrametric spaces - studied in current work of
Bendikov, Girgor'yan and Pittet - and nearest neighbour walks on trees.
Processes of this type have appeared in recent work of Kigami. Every compact
ultrametric space arises as the boundary of a locally finite tree. The duality
arises via the Dirichlet forms: one on the tree associated with a random walk
and the other on the boundary of the tree, which is given in terms of the
Na\""im kernel. Here, it is explained that up to a linear time change by a
unique constant, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the above

analytical way, an efficient algorithm is constructed to solve the sparse PCA
problem. The algorithm only involves simple computations and is thus easy to
implement. The proposed method can also be very easily extended to other sparse
PCA problems with certain constraints, such as the nonnegative sparse PCA
problem. Furthermore, we have shown that the proposed algorithm converges to a
stationary point of the problem, and its computational complexity is
approximately linear in both data size and dimensionality. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is substantiated by extensive experiments implemented on a

documented from the data analysis of both field observations and laboratory
experiments. In this direction, Huang and Turcotte have stated that the
statistics of regional seismicity could be merely a macroscopic reflection of
the physical processes in earthquake source, namely, the activation of a single
fault is a reduced self-affine image of regional seismicity. This work verifies
the aforementioned proposal. More precisely we show that the population of: (i)
the earthquakes that precede of a significant event and occur around its the
epicentre, and (ii) the ""fracto-electromagnetic earthquakes"" that are emerged
during the fracture of strong entities distributed along the activated single
fault sustaining the system follow the same statistics, namely, the relative
cumulative number of earthquakes against magnitude. The analysis is mainly
performed by means of a recently introduced nonextensive model for earthquake
dynamics which leads to a Gutenberg-Richter type law. We examine the variation
of the parameters $q$ and $\alpha$, which are included in the nonextensive law,
for different thresholds of magnitude and different radius around the
epicentre. Such analysis enhances the physical background of the underlying
self-affinity. The parameter $q$ describes the deviation of Tsallis entropy
from the extensive Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, and $\alpha$ is the constant of
proportionality between the energy released during the fracture of a fragment
and its size.

presented as a prototypical model of sand dunes. Although they have been
theoretically shown to be unstable when considered separately, it is well known
that they form large assemblies in desert. Collisions of dunes have been
proposed as a mechanism to redistribute sand between dunes and prevent the
formation of heavily large dunes, resulting in a stabilizing effect in the
context of a dense barchan field. Yet, no models are able to explain the
spatial structures of dunes observed in deserts. Here, we use an agent-based
model with elementary rules of sand redistribution during collisions to access
the full dynamics of very large barchan dune fields. Consequently, stationnary,
out of equilibrium states emerge. Trigging the dune field density by a sand
load/lost ratio, we show that large dune fields exhibit two assymtotic regimes:
a dilute regime, where sand dune nucleation is needed to maintain a dune field,
and a dense regime, where dune collisions allow to stabilize the whole dune
field. In this dense regime, spatial structures form: the dune field is
structured in narrow corridors of dunes extending in the wind direction, as
observed in dense barchan deserts.

remains one of the major challenges. On a multi-antenna relay-assisted
multi-carrier interference channel, each user shares the frequency and spatial
resources with all other users. When the receivers are not only interested in
their own signals but also in eavesdropping other users' signals, the cross
talk on the frequency and spatial channels becomes information leakage. In this
paper, we propose a novel secrecy rate enhancing relay strategy that utilizes
both frequency and spatial resources, termed as information leakage
neutralization. To this end, the relay matrix is chosen such that the effective
channel from the transmitter to the colluding eavesdropper is equal to the
negative of the effective channel over the relay to the colluding eavesdropper
and thus the information leakage to zero. Interestingly, the optimal relay
matrix in general is not block-diagonal which encourages users' encoding over
the frequency channels. We proposed two information leakage neutralization
strategies, namely efficient information leakage neutralization (EFFIN) and
optimized information leakage neutralization (OPTIN). EFFIN provides a simple
and efficient design of relay processing matrix and precoding matrices at the
transmitters in the scenario of limited power and computational resources.
OPTIN, despite its higher complexity, provides a better sum secrecy rate
performance by optimizing the relay processing matrix and the precoding
matrices jointly. The proposed methods are shown to improve the sum secrecy
rates over several state-of-the-art baseline methods.

action of magnetic buoyancy, the loop rises and develops asymmetries between
its leading and following legs, creating emerging bipolar regions whose
characteristics are similar to the ones of observed spots at the solar surface.
In particular, we self-consistently reproduce the creation of tongues around
the spot polarities, which can be strongly affected by convection. We moreover
emphasize the presence of ring-shaped magnetic structures around our simulated
emerging regions, which we call ""magnetic necklace"" and which were seen in a

multilayers based on two material constituents arranged according to Thue-Morse

appearance of additional extraordinary waves which are not predicted by
standard effective-medium-theory (local) models. From the mathematical
viewpoint, these effects can be associated with stationary points of the
transfer-matrix trace, and can be effectively parameterized via the trace-map
formalism. We show that their onset is accompanied by a strong wavevector
dependence in the effective constitutive parameters. In spite of the inherent
periodicity enforced by the unavoidable (Bloch-type) supercell terminations, we
show that such strong nonlocality is retained at any arbitrarily high-order
iterations, i.e., approaching the actual aperiodic regime. Moreover, for
certain parameter configurations, at a given wavelength and for two given
material layers, these effects may be significantly less prominent when the
same layers are arranged in a standard periodic fashion. Our findings indicate
that the (aperiodic) positional order of the layers constitutes an effective
and technologically inexpensive additional degree of freedom in the engineering
of optical nonlocality.

\gamma-rays (TeV PWNe), while others have not (non-TeV PWNe). The TeV emission
detectability is not correlated either with the spin-down power or with the
characteristic age of their central pulsars, and it is an open problem what
determines the detectability. To study this problem, we investigate spectral
evolution of five young non-TeV PWNe, 3C58, G310.6-1.6, G292.0+1.8, G11.2-0.3
and SNR B0540-69.3. We use a spectral evolution model which has been developed
to be applied to young TeV PWNe in our previous works. TeV \gamma-ray flux
upper limits of non-TeV PWNe give upper or lower limits on parameters, such as
the age of the PWN and the fraction of the spin-down power going to the
magnetic energy injection (the fraction parameter). Combined with other
independent observational and theoretical studies, we can guess a plausible
value of the parameters for each object. For 3C58, we prefer the parameters
with an age of 2.5 kyr old and the fraction parameter of 3.0x10^{-3}, although
the spectral modeling alone does not rule out a shorter age and a higher
fraction parameter. The fraction parameter of 3.0x10^{-3} is also consistent
for other non-TeV PWNe and then the value is regarded as common to young PWNe
including TeV PWNe. Moreover, we find that the intrinsic properties of the
central pulsars are similar, 10^{48-50}erg for the initial rotational energy
and 10^{42-44}erg for the magnetic energy (2x10^{12} - 3x10^{13}G for the
dipole magnetic field strength at their surfaces). The TeV detectability is
correlated with the total injected energy and the energy density of the
interstellar radiation field around PWNe. Except for G292.0+1.8, a broken
power-law injection of the particles well reproduces the broadband emission
from non-TeV PWNe.

interconnected? Can hadrons survive chiral symmetry restoration? If yes, what
happens with their mass and what symmetries beyond the chiral symmetry are
there? We review our recent insights. In particular, in a dynamical lattice
simulation we artificially restore chiral symmetry by removing the low-lying
Dirac modes of the valence quark propagators, which is a well defined procedure
and keep gluodynamics intact. Hadrons survive this artificial chiral
restoration and their mass is surprisingly large. All hadrons fall into chiral
multiplets and some of them are degenerate, i.e. the spectrum reveals some
higher symmetry, that includes the chiral symmetry as a subgroup. The U(1)_A
symmetry does not get restored after removal of the chiral modes from the
valence quarks.

Our proof provides an explicit algorithm which requires a destabilizing

Quadric bundles can be thought as a generalization of orthogonal bundles. We

Influence of pairing is systematically investigated in the ^{40}Ca+

transfer probabilities due to initial pairing correlations is observed. This
enhancement induces an increase of the ratio of probabilities P_{2n} /

increases strongly as the center of mass energy decreases with a value that
could be larger than ten in the deep sub-barrier regime. An analysis of the

parton shower merging approaches to next-to-leading order accuracy.
  The generalisation of CKKW-L is based on the NL3 scheme previously developed
for e+e- -annihilation, which is extended to also handle hadronic collisions by
a careful treatment of parton densities. NL3 is further augmented to allow for
more readily accessible NLO input.
  To allow for a more careful handling of merging scale dependencies we
introduce an extension of the UMEPS method. This approach, dubbed UNLOPS, does
not inherit problematic features of CKKW-L, and thus allows for a theoretically
more appealing definition of NLO merging.
  We have implemented both schemes in Pythia8, and present results for the
merging of W- and Higgs-production events, where the zero- and one-jet
contribution are corrected to next-to-leading order simultaneously, and higher
jet multiplicities are described by tree-level matrix elements. The
implementation of the procedure is completely general and can be used for
higher jet multiplicities and other processes, subject to the availability of
programs able to correctly generate the corresponding partonic states to
leading and next-to-leading order accuracy.

temperature at the highest degree of accuracy.
  The Water Vapour Pressure Equation (WVPE) is the basic formula for the
calculation of the vapour pressure and other humidity related quantities.
Improvement in the uncertainty of the water vapour formulation in the
temperature range between -80^{\cdot}C (and possibly down to -90^{\cdot}C) and
+100^{\cdot}C is needed for the improvement of primary standards in the field
of hygrometry. The Triple Point of Water (TPW, temperature 273,16 K) plays a
key role in thermometry, because of its threefold function. On one side, it
defines the temperature unit, the kelvin. On the other side, it is the
reference point in Standard Platinum Resistance Thermometer (SPRT)
calibrations, according to the International Temperature Scale of 1990
(ITS-90). Finally, it is the connection point between the current definition of
the kelvin and the future one, based on the Boltzmann constant.
  Copper cells for WVPE and TPW allow highly accurate temperature control, fast
thermal response time and excellent thermal uniformity, because of the elevated
copper thermal conductivity. Thus, they can be an outstanding tool for reducing
measurement uncertainty. Nevertheless, accurate filling techniques and
procedures are necessary, to minimize water contamination and get stable,
accurate and reproducible results.
  This report describes the filling system and the copper passivation and
cleaning procedure, as well as the method for filling copper cells with
high-purity water.

intervenes in the product formula for the spherical functions. We show that the
sharp criterion developed for $\SO_0(p,q)/\SO(p)\times\SO(q)$ will also serve
for the spaces $SU(p,q)/S(U(p)\timesU(q))$ and $Sp(p,q)/Sp(p)\timesSp(q)$,
$q>p$. We also apply our results to the study of absolute continuity of
convolution powers of an orbital measure $\delta_{e^X}^\natural$.

universe at present epoch. It is commonly incorporated in standard cosmology by
the introduction of an exotic matter (that violates the strong energy
condition) known as dark energy (DE). As event horizon exists for accelerating
universe so there has been a lot of work on universal thermodynamics (i.e.,
thermodynamics of the universe bounded by apparent or event horizon). Recently,
thermodynamical equilibrium has been examined for both the horizons. In the
present work we show that universal thermodynamics with event horizon is
favored by DE from the point of view of equilibrium thermodynamical
prescription.

"1212.0423","Ralph Dougherty","Ralph C. Dougherty and J. Daniel Kimel","Temperature dependence of the superconductor energy gap",,,,,"cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a superconductor to be able to receive an external magnetic field, there
must be a vacant energy state in the superconductor to receive the energy
associated with the field. For a small range of energies near that of the
critical magnetic field, Hc, these energy states lie within the superconductor
temperature dependent energy gap. This paper uses thermodynamic analysis of the
energy balance in the loss of dissipative electron scattering and the change in
entropy of the conducting phase that occur in the phase transition between the
normal metal and the superconducting state to suggest that changes in electron
Gibbs free energy at T, from these sources are the basis for the temperature
dependent energy gap. The critical magnetic field for a superconductor at
temperature, T, Hc(T) occurs when the energy of the magnetic field is equal to
the magnitude of the superconductor energy gap at T. When the superconductor
energy gap is occupied with the energy of the external magnetic field, the
normal metal conducting bands that became inaccessible at the superconductor -
normal conductor phase transition are once again available for conduction, and
the superconductor quenches. Experimental data from the literature suggests
that the ratio of the superconductor energy gap to the superconductor critical
temperature depends upon the chemical structure of superconductor. We
anticipate that the superconducting energy gaps for mercury, and lead will show
small maxima near 0.21, and 0.11 K, respectively.

observed spectrum of quarks and leptons can arise as quasi-particle excitations
in a discrete internal space. The paper concentrated on internal vibrational
modes and it was only noted in the end that internal spin waves ('mignons')
might do the same job. Here it will be shown how the mignon-mechanism works in
detail. In particular the Shubnikov group $A_4 + S (S_4 - A_4)$ will be used to
describe the spectrum, and the mignetic ground state is explicitly given.
