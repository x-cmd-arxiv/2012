estimation of complex nonlinear dynamics with uncertainties which modeled with
white noises. On the other hand behavior of the chaotic systems in time domain
itself is similar to noise too. In this paper, states of the chaotic Lorenz
system that its uncertainties modeled with colored noise on states and also on
output are considered. For both cases, the case that parameters of Lorenz
system are known and the case that parameters of the Lorenz system are unknown,
EKF is used to estimate the states. In the case that parameters are unknown
using a stochastic viewpoint parameters of the system and parameters of the
first order filter of the colored noise are estimated. Efficiency of the method
is shown with simulation.

particular details of penetration of a quantum mechanical particle through the
de Sitter horizon, has been examined intensively there is still some vagueness
in this subject. The present paper aims to clarify the situation. A known
algorithm for calculation of the reflection coefficient $R_{\epsilon j}$ on the
background of the de Sitter space-time model is analyzed. It is shown that the
determination of $R_{\epsilon j}$ requires an additional constrain on quantum
numbers $\epsilon R / \hbar c >> j$, where $R$ is a curvature radius. When
taking into account this condition, the value of $R_{\epsilon j}$ turns out to
be precisely zero. It is shown that the basic instructive definition for the
calculation of the reflection coefficient in de Sitter model is grounded
exclusively on the use of zero order approximation in the expansion of a
particle wave function in a series on small parameter $1/R^{2}$, and it
demonstrated that this recipe cannot be extended on accounting for
contributions of higher order terms. So the result $R_{\epsilon j}=0$ which has
been obtained from examining zero-order term persists and cannot be improved.
It is claimed that the alculation of the reflection coefficient $R_{\epsilon
j}$ is not required at all because there is no barrier in the effective
potential curve on the background of the de Sitter space-time, the later
correlate with the fact that the problem in de Sitter space reduces to a second
order differential equation with only three singular points. However all known
quantum mechanical problems with potentials containing one barrier reduce to a
second order differential equation with four singular points, the equation of
Heun class.

presents are largely the anti-Copernican arguments of the great Danish
astronomer Tycho Brahe; one of these (an argument based on measurements of the
apparent sizes of stars) was all but unanswerable. Ingoli's emphasis on the
scientific arguments of Brahe, and his lack of emphasis on theological

theory was, in contrast to how it is usually viewed, essentially scientific in
nature, following the ideas of Brahe.

distribution? Recent work suggests that some auto-encoder variants do a good
job of capturing the local manifold structure of data. This paper clarifies
some of these previous observations by showing that minimizing a particular
form of regularized reconstruction error yields a reconstruction function that
locally characterizes the shape of the data generating density. We show that
the auto-encoder captures the score (derivative of the log-density with respect
to the input). It contradicts previous interpretations of reconstruction error
as an energy function. Unlike previous results, the theorems provided here are
completely generic and do not depend on the parametrization of the
auto-encoder: they show what the auto-encoder would tend to if given enough
capacity and examples. These results are for a contractive training criterion
we show to be similar to the denoising auto-encoder training criterion with
small corruption noise, but with contraction applied on the whole
reconstruction function rather than just encoder. Similarly to score matching,
one can consider the proposed training criterion as a convenient alternative to
maximum likelihood because it does not involve a partition function. Finally,
we show how an approximate Metropolis-Hastings MCMC can be setup to recover
samples from the estimated distribution, and this is confirmed in sampling
experiments.

vertices into a larger graph, H(G), whose independence number is strictly
smaller than its Lov\'asz number which is equal to its fractional packing
number. The vertices of H(G) represent all possible events consistent with the
stabilizer group of the graph state associated with G, and exclusive events are
adjacent. Mathematically, the graph H(G) corresponds to the orbit of G under
local complementation. Physically, the construction translates into
graph-theoretic terms the connection between a graph state and a Bell
inequality maximally violated by quantum mechanics. In the context of
zero-error information theory, the construction suggests a protocol achieving
the maximum rate of entanglement-assisted capacity, a quantum mechanical
analogue of the Shannon capacity, for each H(G). The violation of the Bell
inequality is expressed by the one-shot version of this capacity being strictly
larger than the independence number. Finally, given the correspondence between
graphs and exclusivity structures, we are able to compute the independence
number for certain infinite families of graphs with the use of quantum
non-locality, therefore highlighting an application of quantum theory in the
proof of a purely combinatorial statement.

the extent of burial or exposure of that residue in the 3D structure. RSA is
frequently used to describe a protein's biophysical or evolutionary properties.
To calculate RSA, a residue's solvent accessibility (ASA) needs to be
normalized by a suitable reference value for the given amino acid; several
normalization scales have previously been proposed. However, these scales do
not provide tight upper bounds on ASA values frequently observed in empirical
crystal structures. Instead, they underestimate the largest allowed ASA values,
by up to 20%. As a result, many empirical crystal structures contain residues
that seem to have RSA values in excess of one. Here, we derive a new
normalization scale that does provide a tight upper bound on observed ASA
values. We pursue two complementary strategies, one based on extensive analysis
of empirical structures and one based on systematic enumeration of
biophysically allowed tripeptides. Both approaches yield congruent results that
consistently exceed published values. We conclude that previously published ASA
normalization values were too small, primarily because the conformations that
maximize ASA had not been correctly identified. As an application of our
results, we show that empirically derived hydrophobicity scales are sensitive
to accurate RSA calculation, and we derive new hydrophobicity scales that show
increased correlation with experimentally measured scales.

bands and in medium and fast scan speeds. This branch of the PACS Photometer
pipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-source
observations.The calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal applied
by the PACS pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulations
obtained by ""polluting"" real PACS timelines with fake sources at different flux
levels. The effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final map
noise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high data
redundancy. We show that the running median removal can cause significant flux
losses at any flux level. We analyse the advantages and disadvantages of
several masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circular
patches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of flux
loss. We provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for several
masking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as a
function of the source flux. We also show that, for stacking analysis, the
impact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly the
clustering effect. The analysis of the global noise and noise components of the
PACS maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise is
the high-pass filter width. We also provide simple fitting functions to build
the error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlation
correction factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameter
space.

commonly contaminated by unwanted variation factors such as platforms or
batches. Not taking this unwanted variation into account when analyzing the
data can lead to spurious associations and to missing important signals. When
the analysis is unsupervised, e.g., when the goal is to cluster the samples or
to build a corrected version of the dataset - as opposed to the study of an
observed factor of interest - taking unwanted variation into account can become
a difficult task. The unwanted variation factors may be correlated with the
unobserved factor of interest, so that correcting for the former can remove the
latter if not done carefully. We show how negative control genes and replicate
samples can be used to estimate unwanted variation in gene expression, and
discuss how this information can be used to correct the expression data or
build estimators for unsupervised problems. The proposed methods are then
evaluated on three gene expression datasets. They generally manage to remove
unwanted variation without losing the signal of interest and compare favorably
to state of the art corrections.

(NIR-I, 0.75~0.9 microns) or microscopic computed tomography (micro-CT), while
the temporal resolution far exceeds scanning microscopic imaging techniques.
Arterial and venous vessels are unambiguously differentiated using a dynamic
contrast-enhanced NIR-II imaging technique based on their distinct
hemodynamics. Further, the deep tissue penetration, high spatial and temporal
resolution of NIR-II imaging allow for precise quantifications of blood
velocity in both normal and ischemic femoral arteries, which are beyond the
capability of ultrasonography at lower blood velocity.

star turned out to be of the delta Sct type with two pulsational modes excited.

a member of the cluster. Moreover, we found 13 eclipsing systems, of which five
are W UMa stars, one is a beta Lyr variable, six are beta Per binaries showing
detached configuration, and the last one is another probable beta Per system.

optical to mid-infrared color excess ratios, and found that the
total-to-selective extinction ratio is Rv = 3.2, which is very close to the
normal value. But many early-type stars in the cluster center show large color
excess ratios. We derived the surface density profiles of four member groups,
and found that they reach the surface density of field stars at about 10',
regardless of stellar mass.
  The IMF of NGC 6231 is derived for the mass range 0.8 -- 45 Msun. The slope
of the IMF of NGC 6231 (Gamma = -1.1 +/- 0.1) is slightly shallower than the
canonical value, but the difference is marginal. In addition, the mass function
varies systematically, and is a strong function of radius - it is is very
shallow at the center, and very steep at the outer ring suggesting the cluster
is mass segregated. We confirm the mass segregation for the massive stars (m >~
8 Msun) by a minimum spanning tree analysis. Using a Monte Carlo method, we
estimate the total mass of NGC 6231 to be about 2.6 (+/- 0.6) x 10^3 Msun. We
constrain the age of NGC 6231 by comparison with evolutionary isochrones. The
age of the low-mass stars ranges from 1 to 7 Myr with a slight peak at 3 Myr.
However the age of the high mass stars depends on the adopted models and is 3.5
+/- 0.5 Myr from the non- or moderately-rotating models of Brott et al. as well
as the non-rotating models of Ekstr\""om et al. But the age is 4.0 -- 7.0 Myr if
the rotating models of Ekstr\""om et al. are adopted. This latter age is in
excellent agreement with the time scale of ejection of the high mass runaway
star HD 153919 from NGC 6231, albeit the younger age cannot be entirely

multidimensional multiverse. We consider a simple model in which the vacua are
nucleated from a $D$-dimensional parent spacetime through dynamical
compactification of the extra dimensions, and compute the geometric
contribution to the probability distribution of observations within the
multiverse for each measure. We then study how the shape of this probability
distribution depends on the timescales for the existence of observers, for
vacuum domination, and for curvature domination ($t_{obs}, t_{\Lambda},$ and
$t_c$, respectively.) In this work we restrict ourselves to bubbles with
positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$. In the case of the causal patch
cutoff, when the bubble universes have $p+1$ large spatial dimensions with $p
\geq 2$, the shape of the probability distribution is such that we obtain the
coincidence of timescales $t_{obs} \sim t_{\Lambda} \sim t_c$. Moreover, the
size of the cosmological constant is related to the size of the landscape.
However, the exact shape of the probability distribution is different in the
case $p = 2$, compared to $p \geq 3$. In the case of the fat geodesic measure,
the result is even more robust: the shape of the probability distribution is
the same for all $p \geq 2$, and we once again obtain the coincidence $t_{obs}
\sim t_{\Lambda} \sim t_c$. These results require only very mild conditions on
the prior probability of the distribution of vacua in the landscape. Our work
shows that the observed double coincidence of timescales is a robust prediction
even when the multiverse is generalized to be multidimensional; that this
coincidence is not a consequence of our particular universe being
(3+1)-dimensional; and that this observable cannot be used to preferentially
select one measure over another in a multidimensional multiverse.

Markowitz-Fama (MF) sets of mean-variances for asset portfolio returns, and the
set of structural elasticities in Chetty (2012)'s analysis of demand with

allows us to construct convenient and powerful confidence regions based upon
the weighted likelihood ratio and weighted Wald (directed weighted Hausdorff)
statistics. The statistics we formulate differ (in part) from existing
statistics in that they enforce either exact or first order equivariance to
transformations of parameters, making them especially appealing in the target
applications. Moreover, the resulting inference procedures are also more
powerful than the structured projection methods, which rely upon building
confidence sets for the frontier-determining sufficient parameters (e.g.
frontier-spanning portfolios), and then projecting them to obtain confidence
sets for HJ sets or MF sets. Lastly, the framework we put forward is also
useful for analyzing intersection bounds, namely sets defined as solutions to
multiple smooth inequalities, since multiple inequalities can be conservatively
approximated by a single smooth inequality. We present two empirical examples

conclusions.

light on the physical properties of the most compact radio sources.
  Methods. Archival data from the VLBA at 15 GHz over a time span of 13.6 yr
are used to investigate the kinematics of the radio source. The flux density
monitoring data obtained at the Michigan 26-meter radio telescope are also used
as supplementary information.
  Results. At 8.4 and 15 GHz, the two lobes are resolved into two
sub-components, identified as hotspots. A knotty jet is linked with the NE
hotspot and traces back toward the geometric center. The core is too weak to be
detected. Significant flux density variation is found in the primary hotspots
with the maximum level of 62% (NE1) and 19% (SW1). The peak in the flux density
of NE1 leads that of SW1 by approximately 5.00 yr, suggesting that the
northeast lobe is advancing and the southwest lobe is receding. This light
travel difference indicates a radial distance difference between the two
hotspots of 1.53 pc, which indicates an inclination angle of about 80.8 degree
between the radio jet and the line of sight. The angular separation rate
between NE1 and SW1 is 0.027 mas/yr (or 0.133 c). The inner jet knot moves at
0.047 mas/yr (or 0.230 c), about 3.5 times the hotspot advancing speed.
  Conclusions. The large viewing angle and the modest jet speed suggest a
mildly relativistic jet. The jet axis is close to the plane of the sky. The
separation rate and the distance between the two primary hotspots result in a
kinematic age of 255$\pm$17 yr, confirming that OQ 208 is indeed a young radio
source. In addition to the hotspot advancing motions, sideways motions provide
evidence that the lobes are obstructed by the external interstellar medium.

of dependability (i.e., partition tolerance and availability), as well as
performance (i.e., latency). Such systems provide eventual
consistency,which---to this point---has been difficult to quantify in real
systems. Given the many implementations and deployments of
eventually-consistent systems (e.g., NoSQL systems), attempts have been made to
measure this consistency empirically, but they suffer from important drawbacks.
For example, state-of-the art consistency benchmarks exercise the system only
in restricted ways and disrupt the workload, which limits their accuracy.
  In this paper, we take the position that a consistency benchmark should paint
a comprehensive picture of the relationship between the storage system under
consideration, the workload, the pattern of failures, and the consistency
observed by clients. To illustrate our point, we first survey prior efforts to
quantify eventual consistency. We then present a benchmarking technique that
overcomes the shortcomings of existing techniques to measure the consistency
observed by clients as they execute the workload under consideration. This
method is versatile and minimally disruptive to the system under test. As a
proof of concept, we demonstrate this tool on Cassandra.

Hubble Space Telescope imaging. These broad-lined active galactic nuclei (AGNs)
possess the spectral signatures of massive intermediate-aged stellar
populations making them potentially useful for studying connections between
nuclear activity and host galaxy evolution. We model the spectra in order to
determine the ages and masses of the host stellar populations, and the black
hole masses and Eddington fractions of the AGNs. Our model components include
an instantaneous starburst, a power-law, and emission lines. We find the PSQs
have MBH ~ 10^8 Msun accreting at a few percent of Eddington luminosity and
host ~ 10^10.5 Msun stellar populations which are several hundred Myr to a few
Gyr old. We investigate relationships among these derived properties, spectral
properties, and morphologies. We find that PSQs hosted in spiral galaxies have
significantly weaker AGN luminosities, older starburst ages, and narrow
emission-line ratios diagnostic of ongoing star-formation when compared to
their early-type counterparts. We conclude that the early-type PSQs are likely
the result of major mergers and were likely luminous infrared galaxies in the
past, while spiral PSQs with more complex star-formation histories are
triggered by less dramatic events (e.g., harassment, bars). We provide
diagnostics to distinguish the early-type and spiral hosts when high spatial
resolution imaging is not available.

to another node $j$ chosen stochastically according to the equilibrium
distribution of Markov chain representing the random walk is called Kemeny
constant, which is closely related to the navigability on the network. Thus,
the configuration of a network that provides optimal or suboptimal navigation
efficiency is a question of interest. It has been proved that complete graphs
have the exact minimum Kemeny constant over all graphs. In this paper, by using
another method we first prove that complete graphs are the optimal networks
with a minimum Kemeny constant, which grows linearly with the network size.
Then, we study the Kemeny constant of a class of sparse networks that exhibit
remarkable scale-free and fractal features as observed in many real-life
networks, which cannot be described by complete graphs. To this end, we
determine the closed-form solutions to all eigenvalues and their degeneracies
of the networks. Employing these eigenvalues, we derive the exact solution to
the Kemeny constant, which also behaves linearly with the network size for some
particular cases of networks. We further use the eigenvalue spectra to
determine the number of spanning trees in the networks under consideration,
which is in complete agreement with previously reported results. Our work
demonstrates that scale-free and fractal properties are favorable for efficient
navigation, which could be considered when designing networks with high
navigation efficiency.

metrics for pattern assessment and employ them in analyzing pattern retention

alteration of an accepted model for honey/pollen consumption based on local

that adding global information, by biasing the queen's movements towards the

stellar mass function and correlation function of galaxies in the local
Universe. In contrast, the semi-analytical models of De Lucia & Blazoit 2007
(DLB07) and Guo et al. 2011 (Guo11), built on the same dark matter halo merger
trees than the empirical model, still have difficulties in reproducing these
observational data simultaneously. We compare the relations between the stellar
mass of galaxies and their host halo mass in the three models, and find that
they are different. When the relations are rescaled to have the same median
values and the same scatter as in Wang et al., the rescaled DLB07 model can fit
both the measured galaxy stellar mass function and the correlation function
measured in different galaxy stellar mass bins. In contrast, the rescaled Guo11
model still over-predicts the clustering of low-mass galaxies. This indicates
that the detail of how galaxies populate the scatter in the stellar mass --
halo mass relation does play an important role in determining the correlation
functions of galaxies. While the stellar mass of galaxies in the Wang et al.
model depends only on halo mass and is randomly distributed within the scatter,
galaxy stellar mass depends also on the halo formation time in semi-analytical
models. At fixed value of infall mass, galaxies that lie above the median
stellar mass -- halo mass relation reside in haloes that formed earlier, while
galaxies that lie below the median relation reside in haloes that formed later.
This effect is much stronger in Guo11 than in DLB07, which explains the
over-clustering of low mass galaxies in Guo11. Our results illustrate that the
assumption of random scatter in the relation between stellar and halo mass as
employed by current HOD and abundance matching models may be problematic in
case a significant assembly bias exists in the real Universe.

  Astronomy and Astrophysics",,"10.1088/1674-4527/13/4/005",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a detailed comparison of two approaches, the use of a
pre-calculated database and simulated annealing (SA), for fitting the continuum
spectral energy distribution (SED) of astrophysical objects whose appearance is
dominated by surrounding dust. While pre-calculated databases are commonly used
to model SED data, only few studies to date employed SA due to its unclear
accuracy and convergence time for this specific problem. From a methodological
point of view, different approaches lead to different fitting quality, demand
on computational resources and calculation time. We compare the fitting quality
and computational costs of these two approaches for the task of SED fitting to
provide a guide to the practitioner to find a compromise between desired
accuracy and available resources. To reduce uncertainties inherent to real
datasets, we introduce a reference model resembling a typical circumstellar
system with 10 free parameters. We derive the SED of the reference model with
our code MC3D at 78 logarithmically distributed wavelengths in the range
[0.3um, 1.3mm] and use this setup to simulate SEDs for the database and SA. Our
result shows directly the applicability of SA in the field of SED modeling,
since the algorithm regularly finds better solutions to the optimization
problem than a pre-calculated database. As both methods have advantages and
shortcomings, a hybrid approach is preferable. While the database provides an
approximate fit and overall probability distributions for all parameters
deduced using Bayesian analysis, SA can be used to improve upon the results
returned by the model grid.

algebra. This task is usually divided into two parts: isolation and refinement.
In this paper, we propose two algorithms LZ1 and LZ2 to refine real roots of
univariate polynomial equations. Our algorithms combine Newton's method and the
secant method to bound the unique solution in an interval of a monotonic convex
isolation (MCI) of a polynomial, and have quadratic and cubic convergence
rates, respectively. To avoid the swell of coefficients and speed up the
computation, we implement the two algorithms by using the floating-point
interval method in Maple15 with the package intpakX. Experiments show that our
methods are effective and much faster than the function RefineBox in the
software Maple15 on benchmark polynomials.

Potts model can be studied by means of a graph polynomial P_B(q,v), henceforth
referred to as the critical polynomial. This polynomial may be defined on any
periodic two-dimensional lattice. It depends on a finite subgraph B, called the
basis, and the manner in which B is tiled to construct the lattice. The real
roots v = e^K - 1 of P_B(q,v) either give the exact critical points for the
lattice, or provide approximations that, in principle, can be made arbitrarily
accurate by increasing the size of B in an appropriate way. In earlier work,
P_B(q,v) was defined by a contraction-deletion identity, similar to that
satisfied by the Tutte polynomial. Here, we give a probabilistic definition of
P_B(q,v), which facilitates its computation, using the transfer matrix, on much
larger B than was previously possible. We present results for the critical
polynomial on the (4,8^2), kagome, and (3,12^2) lattices for bases of up to
respectively 96, 162, and 243 edges, compared to the limit of 36 edges with
contraction-deletion. We discuss in detail the role of the symmetries and the
embedding of B. The critical temperatures v_c obtained for ferromagnetic (v>0)
Potts models are at least as precise as the best available results from Monte
Carlo simulations or series expansions. For instance, with q=3 we obtain
v_c(4,8^2) = 3.742 489(4), v_c(kagome) = 1.876 459 7(2), and v_c(3,12^2) =
5.033 078 49(4), the precision being comparable or superior to the best

ultraviolet (UV) selected galaxies at z\sim1.5. Using stacking at 250, 350 and
500 um from Herschel Space Observatory SPIRE imaging of the COSMOS field
obtained within the HerMES key program, we derive the mean IR luminosity as a
function of both UV luminosity and slope of the UV continuum beta. The IR to UV
luminosity ratio is roughly constant over most of the UV luminosity range we
explore. We also find that the IR to UV luminosity ratio is correlated with
beta. We observe a correlation that underestimates the correlation derived from
low-redshift starburst galaxies, but is in good agreement with the correlation
derived from local normal star-forming galaxies. Using these results we
reconstruct the IR luminosity function of our UV-selected sample. This
luminosity function recovers the IR luminosity functions measured from IR
selected samples at the faintest luminosities (Lir ~ 10^{11} L_sun), but might
underestimate them at the bright-end (Lir > 5.10^{11} L_sun). For galaxies with
10^{11}<Lir/L_sun<10^{13}, the IR luminosity function of a UV selection
recovers (given the differences in IR-based estimates) 52-65 to 89-112 per cent
of the star-formation rate density derived from an IR selection. The cosmic
star-formation rate density derived from this IR luminosity function is 61-76
to 100-133 per cent of the density derived from IR selections at the same
epoch. Assuming the latest Herschel results and conservative stacking
measurements, we use a toy model to fully reproduce the far IR luminosity
function from our UV selection at z\sim 1.5. This suggests that a sample around
4 magnitudes deeper (i.e. reaching u \sim 30 mag) and a large dispersion of the

metals. In correlated systems, it is interesting to compare this experimental
value to that obtained in band structure calculations, as deviations are
usually taken as a good indicator of the presence of strong electronic
correlations. Nevertheless, it is not always straightforward to extract vF from
ARPES spectra. We study here the case of layered cobaltates, an interesting
family of correlated metals. We compare the results obtained by standard
methods, namely the fit of spectra at constant momentum k (energy distribution
curve, EDC) or constant binding energy omega(momentum distribution curve, MDC).
We find that the difference of vF between the two methods can be as large as a
factor 2. The reliability of the 2 methods is intimately linked to the degree
of k- and omega-dependence of the electronic self-energy. As the k-dependence
is usually much smaller than the omega dependence for a correlated system, the
MDC analysis is generally expected to give more reliable results. However, we
review here several examples within cobaltates, where the MDC analysis
apparently leads to unphysical results, while the EDC analysis appears
coherent. We attribute the difference between the EDC and MDC analysis to a
strong variation of the photoemission intensity with the momentum k. This
distorts the MDC lineshapes but does not affect the EDC ones. Simulations
including a k dependence of the intensity allow to reproduce the difference
between MDC and EDC analysis very well. This momentum dependence could be of
extrinsic or intrinsic. We argue that the latter is the most likely and
actually contains valuable information on the nature of the correlations that
would be interesting to extract further.

kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect using WMAP data and X-ray selected clusters
from ROSAT have identified a bulk flow of galaxy clusters at $\sim 600-1,000$
km s$^{-1}$ on scales of $\sim0.5-1$ Gpc, roughly aligned with the all-sky
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole. The flow is inferred from the
detection of a residual dipole generated by CMB fluctuations exclusively in the
direction of galaxy clusters, and measured within apertures containing zero
monopole. Consistent with this interpretation, the amplitude of the dipole
correlates with the X-ray luminosity of the clusters. To enable this
measurement, the CMB data need to be filtered to remove the primary CMB,
thereby increasing the data's signal-to-noise ratio. Filtering cannot imprint a
signal with the mentioned properties at cluster positions; however, an
inadequately designed filter can greatly suppress such a signal. We show here
that recent studies that failed to detect a large-scale flow with various
filters indeed adopted flawed implementations; when correctly implemented,
these alternative filters lead to results that are in fact consistent with the
Dark Flow signal. The discrepancies can be traced to the likely presence of
residual dipoles caused by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, to
assumptions about cluster profiles incompatible with the data as well as
failure to compute dipoles at the zero monopole aperture. PLANCK maps, with
their large frequency coverage and a 217 GHz channel, will be instrumental to
probe bulk flows, to remove spurious dipole signals and to help identify
filtering schemes appropriate for this measurement.

widely used model potentials are revisited. By a simultaneous least-squared fit
to the observed rotation curve, in-plane proper motion of Sgr A*, local
mass/surface density and the velocity dispersion in Baade's window, parameters
of the potentials are brought up-to-date. The mass at large radii - and thus in

that the most extreme halo blue horizontal-branch star known has to be bound to
the Milky Way. The Galactic mass models are tuned to yield a very good match to
recent observations. The mass of the dark matter halo is - within the
limitations of the applied models - estimated in a fully consistent way. As a
first application, the trajectory of the hypervelocity star HE 0437-5439 is
re-investigated to check its suggested origin in the Large Magellanic Cloud

unique behavior, which is not related to the thermodynamic limit and cannot be

exoplanets and exoplanet candidates have been discovered. The amount of CO2 in
their atmosphere is of great importance for surface conditions and
habitability. In the absence of detailed information on the geochemistry of the
planet, this amount could be considered as a free parameter. Up to now, CO2
partial pressures for terrestrial planets have been obtained assuming an
available volatile reservoir and outgassing scenarios. This study aims at
calculating the allowed maximum CO2 pressure at the surface of terrestrial
exoplanets orbiting near the outer boundary of the habitable zone by coupling
the radiative effects of the CO2 and its condensation at the surface. These
constraints might limit the permitted amount of atmospheric CO2, independent of
the planetary reservoir. A 1D radiative-convective cloud-free atmospheric model
was used. CO2 partial pressures are fixed according to surface temperature and
vapor pressure curve. Considered scenarios cover a wide range of parameters.
Results show that for planets in the habitable zone around K-, G-, and F-type
stars the allowed CO2 pressure is limited by the vapor pressure curve and not
by the planetary reservoir. The maximum CO2 pressure lies below the CO2 vapor
pressure at the critical point of pcrit =73.8 bar. For M-type stars, CO2
pressures above pcrit are possible for almost all scenarios considered across
the habitable zone. This implies that determining CO2 partial pressures for
terrestrial planets by using only geological models is probably too simplified
and might over-estimate atmospheric CO2 towards the outer edge of the habitable
zone. (abridged)

assists in quantifying the impact of various fading channel models and

semianalytical expression for the distribution of the location of the scheduled
user in a given cell considering a wide range of scheduling schemes. Based on
this, we derive the distribution and moment generating function (MGF) of the
uplink ICI considering a single interfering cell. Consequently, we determine
the MGF of the cumulative ICI observed from all interfering cells and derive
explicit MGF expressions for three typical fading models. Finally, we utilize
the obtained expressions to evaluate important network performance metrics such
as the outage probability, ergodic capacity, and average fairness numerically.
Monte-Carlo simulation results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the
derived analytical expressions.

The Petrov type (PT) in the frame of the observer crossing the horizon can be
different from that formally obtained in the usual (but singular in the horizon
limit) frame of an observer on a circular orbit. We call this entity the
boosted Petrov type (BPT), as the corresponding frame is obtained by a singular
boost from the regular one. The PT off-horizon can be more general than PT
on-horizon and that can be more general than the BPT on horizon. This is valid
for all regular metrics, irrespective of the extremality of the horizon. We
analyze and classify the possible relations between the three characteristics
and discuss the nature and features of the underlying singular boost. The three
Petrov types can be the same only for space-times of PT D and O off-horizon.
The mutual alignment of principal null directions and the generator in the

special class of metrics with utra-extremal horizons (for which the regularity

bounded independent and identically distributed or finite state Markovian.
Simulation results verifying uniformly logarithmic weak regret are also
presented. The proposed policy is a centrally coordinated index policy, in
which the index of a frequency band is comprised of a sample mean term and a
confidence term. The sample mean term promotes spectrum exploitation whereas
the confidence term encourages exploration. The confidence term is designed
such that the time interval between consecutive sensing instances of any
suboptimal band grows exponentially. This exponential growth between suboptimal
sensing time instances leads to logarithmically growing weak regret. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed policy performs better than other similar
methods in the literature.

which is non-hermitian, symmetric and magic. In particular, we find that the
requirement of obtaining real mass eigenvalues by transferring the residual
phases to the mass eigenstates self-consistently, dictates the following
relationship between the imaginary part of the mass matrix elements $B$ and the
parameters of the FL model:
$B=\pm\sqrt{3/4(a-b_{r})^{2}\sin^{2}2\theta_{13}\cos^{2}\theta_{12}}$. We
obtain inverted neutrino mass hierarchy, $m_{3}=0$. Making a correspondence
between our model and the experimental data produces stringent conditions on
the parameters as follows:
$35.06^{\circ}\lesssim\theta_{12}\lesssim36.27^{\circ}$, $\theta_{23}=
45^{\circ}$, $7.27^{\circ}\lesssim\theta_{13}\lesssim11.09^{\circ}$, and
$82.03^{\circ}\lesssim\delta\lesssim85.37^{\circ}$. We get mildly broken
$\mu-\tau$ symmetry, which reduces the resultant neutrino mixing pattern from
tribimaximal (TBM) to trimaximal (TM). The CP violation as measured by the

interference rises and may limit the capacity. Alternatively, cellular
technologies using centralized interference coordination can provide the same
capacity with the fewer number of APs at the price of more expensive equipment

sophisticated coordination pays off in terms of total system cost. To make this
comparison, we assess the required AP density of three candidate systems for a

with frequency planning, and an advanced system employing multi-cell joint
processing. Numerical results show that dense Wi-Fi is the cheapest solution at
a relatively low demand level. However, the AP density grows quickly at a
critical demand level regardless of propagation conditions. Beyond this Wi-Fi
network limit, the conventional pico-cellular network works and is cheaper than
the joint processing in obstructed environments, e.g., furnished offices with

becomes the most viable solution. The drawback is that extremely accurate

depends on the sample size; for the Jarzynski estimator the slowness of the
work protocol is crucial, and the Bennett method is shown to give precise
estimates irrespective of the pulling speed and sample size as long as the
dissipated works are the same for the forward and the backward process as it is
the case for Gaussian work distributions. With an increasing dissipated work
difference the Bennett estimator also acquires a bias which increases roughly
in proportion to this difference. A substantial simplification of the Bennett
estimator is provided by the 1/2-formula which expresses the free energy
difference by the algebraic average of the Jarzynski estimates for the forward
and the backward processes. It agrees with the Bennett estimate in all cases
when the Jarzynski and the Crooks estimates fail to give reliable results.

elucidate the role of resonance coupling, site energies, nuclear mode and
energy disorder in the enhancement of vibronic-exciton and ground-state
vibrational coherences, and to identify regimes where this enhancement is
significant. For a heterodimer representing the two coupled BChls 3 and 4 of
the FMO complex, the initial amplitude of the vibronic-exciton and vibrational
coherences are enhanced by up to 15 and 5 times, respectively, compared to the
vibrational coherences in the isolated monomer. This maximum initial amplitude
enhancement occurs when there is a resonance between the electronic energy gap
and the frequency of the vibrational mode. The bandwidth of this enhancement is
about 100 cm-1 for both mechanisms. The excitonic mixing of electronic and
vibrational DOF leads to additional dephasing relative to the vibrational
coherences. We evaluate the dephasing dynamics by solving the quantum master
equation in Markovian approximation and observe a strong dependence of the
life-time enhancement on the mode frequency. Long-lived vibronic-exciton
coherences are found to be generated only when the frequency of the mode is in
the vicinity of the electronic resonance. Although the vibronic-exciton
coherences exhibit a larger initial amplitude compared to the ground-state
vibrational coherences, we conclude that both type have a similar magnitude at
long time for the present model. The ability to distinguish between
vibronic-exciton and ground-state vibrational coherences in the general case of
molecular aggregate is discussed.

directly the likelihood of the discrete kinematic data given the model

model and an axisymmetric, anisotropic Jeans equation model.We apply these
approaches to the enigmatic globular cluster omega Centauri, combining the
proper motion from van Leeuwen et al (2000) with improved photometric cluster
membership probabilities. We show that all mass estimates based on spherical

diffusion of momentum which is important to describe accurately the full
dynamic of the thin film flows when instabilities like roll-waves arise. These
models are validated through a comparison with Orr Sommerfeld equations for
large scale perturbations. We only consider laminar flow for which the boundary
layer issued from the interaction of the flow with the bottom surface has an
influence all over the transverse direction to the flow. In this case the
concept itself of thin film and its relation with long wave asymptotic leads
naturally to flow conditions around a uniform free surface Poiseuille flow. The
apparent viscosity diverges at the free surface which, in turn, introduces a
singularity in the formulation of the Orr-Sommerfeld equations and in the
derivation of shallow water models. We remove this singularity by introducing a
weaker formulation of Cauchy momentum equations. No regularization procedure is
needed nor distinction between shear thinning/thickening cases. Our analysis is
only valid when the flow behavior index $n$ is larger than 1/2 and strongly
suggests that the equations are ill posed if $n<1/2$.

voltage from the inverse of the exponent of the exponential fit to the tail,
which can be done even if the background and/or noise cover-up most of the

used single electron response (SER) method, which uses a LED to induce a single
photoelectron response of the PMT and determines the peak position of such
response, relative to the pedestal peak (the electronic noise peak, which
corresponds to 0 photoelectrons). The results of the exponential fit method
agree with those obtained by the SER method when the average number of
photoelectrons reaching the first dynode per light/scintillation pulse is
around 1.0. The SER method has higher precision, while the exponential fit
method has the advantage of being useful in situations where the PMT is already
in situ, being difficult or even impossible to apply the SER method, e.g. in
sealed scintillator/PMT devices.

models the noise variance process that contaminates the observed data as a

essentially obtain a mixture Gaussian process conditional heteroscedasticity

nonparametric prior with power-law nature over the distribution of the model
mixture components, namely the Pitman-Yor process prior, to allow for better
capturing modeled data distributions with heavy tails and skewness. Finally, we
provide a copula- based approach for obtaining a predictive posterior for the

  converters, non-resistive load, and variable switching frequency",,,,"cs.SY math.DS nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Nonlinear systems, such as switching DC-DC boost or buck converters, have
rich dynamics. A simple one-dimensional discrete-time model is used to analyze
the boost or buck converter in discontinuous conduction mode. Seven different
control schemes (open-loop power stage, voltage mode control, current mode
control, constant power load, constant current load, constant-on-time control,
and boundary conduction mode) are analyzed systematically. The linearized
dynamics is obtained simply by taking partial derivatives with respect to
dynamic variables. In the discrete-time model, there is only a single pole and
no zero. The single closed-loop pole is a linear combination of three terms:
the open-loop pole, a term due to the control scheme, and a term due to the
non-resistive load. Even with a single pole, the phase response of the
discrete-time model can go beyond -90 degrees as in the two-pole average
models. In the boost converter with a resistive load under current mode
control, adding the compensating ramp has no effect on the pole location.
Increasing the ramp slope decreases the DC gain of control-to-output transfer
function and increases the audio-susceptibility. Similar analysis is applied to
the buck converter with a non-resistive load or variable switching frequency.
The derived dynamics agrees closely with the exact switching model and the past
research results.

role in understanding and prediction of many real phenomena like epidemics or
rumor spreading. The dynamics of such systems may be represented
algorithmically by Monte-Carlo simulations on graphs or by ordinary
differential equations (ODEs). Despite many results in the area of network
modeling the selection of the best computational representation of the model
dynamics remains a challenge. While a closed form description is often
straightforward to derive, it generally cannot be solved analytically; as a
consequence the network dynamics requires a numerical solution of the ODEs or a
direct Monte-Carlo simulation on the networks. Moreover, Monte-Carlo
simulations and ODE solutions are not equivalent since ODEs produce a
deterministic solution while Monte-Carlo simulations are stochastic by nature.
Despite some recent advantages in Monte-Carlo simulations, particularly in the
flexibility of implementation, the computational cost of an ODE solution is
much lower and supports accurate and detailed output analysis such as
uncertainty or sensitivity analyses, parameter identification etc. In this
paper we propose a novel approach to model spreading processes in complex
random heterogeneous networks using systems of nonlinear ordinary differential
equations. We successfully apply this approach to predict the dynamics of
HIV-AIDS spreading in sexual networks, and compare it to historical data.

background source. It has an Einstein radius of 0.79"", about 4 times large than
the effective radius. We perform a lensing analysis using both a Singular
Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) and a Peudo-Isothermal Elliptical Mass Distribution
(PIEMD) for the lensing galaxy, and find that the final results on the total
mass, the dark matter (DM) fraction within the Einstein radius and the external
shear due to a foreground galaxy group are robust with respect of the choice of
the parametric model and the source redshift (yet unknown). We measure the
luminous mass from the photometric data, and find the DM fraction within the
Einstein radius $f_{\rm DM}$ to be between $0.71\pm 0.13$ and $0.79 \pm 0.15$,
depending on the unknown source redshift. Meanwhile, the non-null external
shear found in our lensing models supports the presence and structure of a
galaxy group at $z\sim0.7$, and an independent measurement of the 0.5-2 keV
X-ray luminosity within 20"" around the X-ray centroid provides a group mass of
$M=(3-10)\times 10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}$, in good agreement with the previous
estimate derived through weak lensing analysis.

of targets at any of $n$ possible locations in a finite region. All such
locations may not be occupied by a target. The data from sensors is fused to
determine the set of locations that have targets. We term this the separability
problem. In this paper, we address the separability of an asymptotically large
number of static target locations by using binary proximity sensors. Two models
for target locations are considered: (i) when target locations lie on a
uniformly spaced grid; and, (ii) when target locations are i.i.d. uniformly
distributed in the area. Sensor locations are i.i.d uniformly distributed in
the same finite region, independent of target locations. We derive conditions
on the sensing radius and the number of sensors required to achieve
separability. Order-optimal scaling laws, on the number of sensors as a
function of the number of target locations, for two types of separability
requirements are derived. The robustness or security aspects of the above
problem is also addressed. It is shown that in the presence of adversarial
sensors, which toggle their sensed reading and inject binary noise, the scaling
laws for separability remain unaffected.

spin-transport data for Si and Ge magnetic tunnel devices reveals a scaling
with the tunnel resistance that violates the core feature of available
theories, namely, the linear proportionality of the spin voltage to the
injected spin current density. Instead, an anomalous scaling of the spin signal
with the tunnel resistance is observed, following a power-law with an exponent
between 0.75 and 1 over 6 decades. The scaling extends to tunnel resistance
values larger than 10$^{9}$ $\Omega\mu m^2$, far beyond the regime where the
classical impedance mismatch plays a role. This scaling is incompatible with
existing theory for direct tunnel injection of spins into the semiconductor. It
also demonstrates conclusively that the large spin signal does not originate

electrode, instead of the semiconductor, exhibit no Hanle spin signal, showing
that spin accumulation in localized states within the tunnel barrier is also
not responsible. Control devices in which the spin current is removed by
inserting a non-magnetic interlayer exhibit no Hanle signals either, proving
that the spin signals observed in the standard devices are genuine and
originate from spin-polarized tunneling and the resulting spin accumulation.
Altogether, the scaling results suggest that the spin signal is proportional to
the applied bias voltage, rather than the (spin) current.

real-valued Green's function integral for the far field amplitude to an
equivalent integral over a complex domain. It is shown that the scattered wave,
which is essential for the calculation of the far field integral, can be
computed very efficiently along this complex contour (or manifold, in multiple

discretized damped scattered wave system, the proposed approach results in a
fast and scalable calculation method for the far field map. The complex contour
method is successfully validated on Helmholtz and Schr\""odinger model problems
in two and three spatial dimensions, and multigrid convergence results are
provided to substantiate the wavenumber scalability and overall performance of
the method.

select b-quark jets based on variables such as the impact parameters of
charged-particle tracks, the properties of reconstructed decay vertices, and
the presence or absence of a lepton, or combinations thereof. The performance
of these algorithms has been measured using data from proton-proton collisions
at the LHC and compared with expectations based on simulation. The data used in
this study were recorded in 2011 at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV for a total integrated
luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns. The efficiency for tagging b-quark jets
has been measured in events from multijet and t-quark pair production. CMS has
achieved a b-jet tagging efficiency of 85% for a light-parton misidentification
probability of 10% in multijet events. For analyses requiring higher purity, a
misidentification probability of only 1.5% has been achieved, for a 70% b-jet

two kinds of Sn sites (Sn1 and Sn2 sites). The density functional theory (DFT)
calculations show that the indium substitution at the Sn2 site induces a
metallic band structure, on the other hand, a semiconducting band structure is
obtained from substitution at the Sn1 site. However, according to the previous
reports, since the indium atom prefers to replace the tin atom at the Sn1 site
rather than the Sn2 site, the resistivity of Co3SnInS2 shows
semiconducting-like behavior. In this study we have demonstrated that metallic
behavior and a decrease in resistivity for Se-doped Co3SnInS2 occurs without
suppression of the Seebeck coefficient. From the DFT calculations, when the
selenium content is above 0.5, the total crystallographic energy shows that a
higher indium occupancy at Sn2 site is more stable. Therefore, it is suggested
that the selenium doping suppress the site preference for indium substitution.

that can utilize both distributed and centralized generations. Two recent
trends in microgrids are the integration of local renewable energy sources
(such as wind farms) and the use of co-generation (i.e., to supply both
electricity and heat). However, these trends also bring unprecedented
challenges to the design of intelligent control strategies for microgrids.
Traditional generation scheduling paradigms rely on perfect prediction of
future electricity supply and demand. They are no longer applicable to
microgrids with unpredictable renewable energy supply and with co-generation
(that needs to consider both electricity and heat demand). In this paper, we
study online algorithms for the microgrid generation scheduling problem with
intermittent renewable energy sources and co-generation, with the goal of
maximizing the cost-savings with local generation. Based on the insights from
the structure of the offline optimal solution, we propose a class of
competitive online algorithms, called CHASE (Competitive Heuristic Algorithm
for Scheduling Energy-generation), that track the offline optimal in an online
fashion. Under typical settings, we show that CHASE achieves the best
competitive ratio among all deterministic online algorithms, and the ratio is
no larger than a small constant 3.

that is everywhere finite and positive, which both rules out gravitational
horizons and implies that the self-gravitationally corrected static energy
contained in a sphere of radius r is bounded by r times the fourth power of c
divided by G. Even in the absence of spherical symmetry this energy bound still
applies to within a factor of two, and it cuts off the mass deviation of any
quantum virtual particle at about a Planck mass. Because quantum uncertainty
makes the minimum possible energy of a quantum field infinite, such a field's
self-gravitationally corrected energy attains the value of that field's
containing radius r times the fourth power of c divided by G. Roughly
estimating any quantum field's containing radius r as c times the age of the

if r is put to the Planck length appropriate to the birth of the universe, that
energy density becomes the enormous Planck unit value, which could conceivably
drive primordial ""inflation"". The density of ""dark energy"" decreases as the
