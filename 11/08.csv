Relativistic jets emerging from AGN cores transfer energy from the
core to their surrounding ISM/IGM. Because jets are observed to have finite
opening angles, one needs to quantify the role of conical versus cylindrical
jet propagation in this energy transfer. Aims. We use FR-II AGN jets parameter
with finite opening angles. We study the effect of the variation of the opening
angle on the dynamics and energy transfer of the jet. We also point out how the
characteristics of this external medium, such as its density profile, play a
role in the dynamics. Methods. This study exploits our parallel AMR code
MPI-AMRVAC with its special relativistic hydrodynamic model, incorporating an
equation of state with varying effective polytropic index. We studied mildly
under-dense jets up to opening angles of 10 degrees, at Lorentz factors of
about 10, inspired by observations. Instantaneous quantification of the various
ISM volumes and their energy content allows one to quantify the role of mixing
versus shock-heated cocoon regions over the time intervals. Results. We show
that a wider opening angle jet results in a faster deceleration of the jet and
leads to a wider cocoon dominated by Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor
instabilities. The energy transfer mainly occurs in the shocked ISM region by
both the frontal bow shock and cocoon-traversing shock waves, in a roughly 3 to
1 ratio to the energy transfer of the mixing zone, for a 5 degree opening angle
jet. A rarefaction wave induces a dynamically formed layered structure of the
jet beam. Conclusions. Finite opening angle jets can efficiently transfer
significant fractions (25 % up to 70 %) of their injected energy over a growing
region of shocked ISM matter. The role of the ISM stratification is prominent
for determining the overall volume that is affected by relativistic jet
injection.

for the controlled engineering of single particle quantum dynamics, and have
attracted special attention due to their algorithmic applications in quantum
information science. Even in their simplest 1D architectures, they display
complex topological phenomena, which can be employed in the systematic study of
topological quantum phase transitions [1]. Due to the exponential scaling in
the number of resources required, most experimental realizations of QWs up to
date have been limited to single particles, with only a few implementations
involving correlated quantum pairs. In this article we study applications of
quantum walks in the controlled dynamical engineering of entanglement in
bipartite bosonic systems. We show that quantum walks can be employed in the
transition from mode entanglement, where indistinguishability of the quantum
particles plays a key role, to the standard type of entanglement associated
with distinguishable particles. We also show that, by carefully tailoring the
steps in the QWs, as well as the initial state for the quantum walker, it is
possible to preserve the entanglement content by topological protection. The
underlying mechanism that allows for the possibility of both entanglement
engineering and entanglement protection is the strong ""spin-orbit"" coupling
induced by the QW. We anticipate that the results reported here can be employed
for the controlled emulation of quantum correlations in topological phases.

dynamic processes in magnetic nanostructures, and for the accurate calculation
of rates for such processes. The method is illustrated for the case of
switching of a grain of an exchange-coupled recording medium, which switches
through domain wall nucleation and motion, but is generalizable to other rate
processes such as vortex formation and annihilation. The method involves
calculating the most probable (lowest energy) switching path and projecting the
motion onto that path. The motion is conveniently visualized in a
two-dimensional (2D) projection parameterized by the dipole and quadrupole
moment of the grain. The motion along that path can then be described by a
Langevin equation, and its rate can be computed by the classic method of
Kramers. The rate can be evaluated numerically, or in an analytic approximation
- interestingly, the analytic result for domain-wall switching is very similar
to that obtained by Brown in 1963 for coherent switching, except for a factor
proportional to the domain-wall volume. Thus in addition to its lower
coercivity, an exchange-coupled medium has the additional advantage (over a
uniform medium) of greater thermal stability, for a fixed energy barrier.

339-4 during its hard state, covering a total of seven outbursts over a
15--year period. Our new measurements represent the largest sample for a
stellar mass black hole, without any bias from distance uncertainties, over the
largest flux variations and down to a level that could be close to quiescence,
making GX 339-4 the reference source for comparison with other accreting
sources (black holes, neutrons stars, white dwarfs and active galactic nuclei).
Our results demonstrate a very strong and stable coupling between radio and
X-ray emission, despite several outbursts of different nature and separated by
a period of quiescence. The radio and X-ray luminosity correlation of the form
L_X ~L_Rad^0.62 +/-0.01 confirms the non-linear coupling between the jet and

epochs of deviations from the fit that significantly exceed the measurement
uncertainties, especially during the formation and destruction of the compact

superhydrophobic surfaces have been developed. The statics and dynamics of
fluids on these surfaces have been well characterized. However, few
investigations have been made into the potential of these surfaces to control
and enhance other transport phenomena. In this article, we characterize pool
boiling on surfaces with wettabilities varied from superhydrophobic to
superhydrophilic, and provide nucleation measurements. The most interesting
result of our measurements is that the largest heat transfer coefficients are
reached not on surfaces with spatially uniform wettability, but on biphilic
surfaces, which juxtapose hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. We develop an
analytical model that describes how biphilic surfaces effectively manage the
vapor and liquid transport, delaying critical heat flux and maximizing the heat
transfer coefficient. Finally, we manufacture and test the first superbiphilic
surfaces (juxtaposing superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic regions), which
show exceptional performance in pool boiling, combining high critical heat
fluxes over 100 W/cm2 with very high heat transfer coefficients, over 100

extremal solutions for an arbitrary prepotential, as long as an axion-free

related to the corresponding supersymmetric black holes by a multiplication of
the charge vector with a constant field rotation matrix S. The fake
superpotential driving this first-order flow is nothing else than Hamilton's
characteristic function in a Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, and coincides in the
supersymmetric case (when S is plus or minus the identity) with the
superpotential proposed by Dall'Agata and Gnecchi in arXiv:1012.3756. For the
nonextremal black holes that asymptote to (magnetic) AdS, we compute both the

superalgebra. The latter correctly vanishes in the BPS case, but also for
certain values of the parameters that do not correspond to any known

Spitzer IRAC 8 {\mu}m images, that best reveal these nebular features, can
include contributions not only of H2 lines, but also those of ionic species,
PAH features, and thermal dust continuum emission. To investigate the nature of
the emission detected in mid-IR observations of a sample of 10 PNe, we have
obtained narrow-band near-IR H2 {\lambda}2.122 {\mu}m and optical [N II]
{\lambda}6584 ?A images. The comparison between these images confrm that a
significant fraction of the emission detected in the IRAC 8 {\mu}m images can
be attributed to molecular hydrogen, thus confirming the utility of these
mid-IR images to investigate the molecular component of PNe. We have also
detected H2 emission from PNe whose physical structure cannot be described as
bipolar, but rather as ellipsoidal or barrel-like. These detections suggest
that, as more sensitive observations of PNe in the H2 {\lambda}2.122 line are
acquired, the detection of H2 emission is not exclusive of bipolar PNe,
although objects with this morphology are still the brightest H2 emitters.
Finally, we remark that the bright H2 emission from the equatorial ring of a
bipolar PN does not arise from a photodissociation region shielded from the UV
stellar radiation by the ring itself, but from dense knots and clumps embedded
within the ionized material of the ring.

limited-capacity feedback links that may not immediately convey perfect CSIT,
and focusing on the block fading scenario, we consider a progressively
increasing CSIT quality as time progresses across the coherence period (T
channel uses - evolving current CSIT), or at any time after (delayed CSIT).
  Specifically, for any set of feedback quality exponents a_t, t=1,...,T,
describing the high-SNR rates-of-decay of the mean square error of the current
CSIT estimates at time t<=T (during the coherence period), the work describes
the optimal DOF region in several different evolving CSIT settings, including
the setting with perfect delayed CSIT, the asymmetric setting where the quality
of feedback differs from user to user, as well as considers the DoF region in
the presence of a imperfect delayed CSIT corresponding to having a limited
number of overall feedback bits. These results are supported by novel
multi-phase precoding schemes that utilize gradually improving CSIT.
  The approach here naturally incorporates different settings such as the
perfect-delayed CSIT setting of Maddah-Ali and Tse, the imperfect current CSIT
setting of Yang et al. and of Gou and Jafar, the asymmetric setting of Maleki

inflaton. Based on the time-dependent spatial diffeomorphism, which is not
broken by the time-dependent background evolution, the most generic action of
quasi-single field inflation is constructed up to third order fluctuations.
Using the obtained action, the effects of the additional massive scalar field
on the primordial curvature perturbations are discussed. In particular, we
calculate the power spectrum and discuss the momentum-dependence of three point
functions in the squeezed limit for general settings of quasi-single field
inflation. Our framework can be also applied to inflation models with heavy
particles. We make a qualitative discussion on the effects of heavy particles

interesting combinatorial problem that deserves its consideration. The present

intracluster medium (ICM) pressure profiles of a set of 45 massive galaxy
clusters imaged using Bolocam at the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory. We have
used masses determined from Chandra X-ray observations to scale each cluster's
profile by the overdensity radius R500 and the mass-and-redshift-dependent
normalization factor P500. We deproject the average pressure profile of our
sample into 13 logarithmically spaced radial bins between 0.07R500 and 3.5R500.
We find that a generalized Navarro, Frenk, and White (gNFW) profile describes
our data with sufficient goodness-of-fit and best-fit parameters (C500, alpha,
beta, gamma, P0 = 1.18, 0.86, 3.67, 0.67, 4.29). We also use the X-ray data to
define cool-core and disturbed subsamples of clusters, and we constrain the
average pressure profiles of each of these subsamples. We find that given the
precision of our data the average pressure profiles of disturbed and cool-core
clusters are consistent with one another at R>~0.15R500, with cool-core systems
showing indications of higher pressure at R<~0.15R500. In addition, for the
first time, we place simultaneous constraints on the mass scaling of cluster
pressure profiles, their ensemble mean profile, and their radius-dependent
intrinsic scatter between 0.1R500 and 2.0R500. The scatter among profiles is
minimized at radii between ~0.2R500 and ~0.5R500, with a value of ~20%. The
best-fit mass scaling has a power-law slope of 0.49, which is shallower than
the nominal prediction of 2/3 from self-similar hydrostatic equilibrium models.
These results for the intrinsic scatter and mass scaling are largely consistent
with previous analyses, most of which have relied heavily on X-ray derived
pressures of clusters at significantly lower masses and redshifts compared to
our sample.

study the related problem of computing the coefficients of $f$ modulo a small
prime $\ell$. To this end, we design a practical variant of the complex
approximations method presented in the book edited by B. Edixhoven and J.-M.
Couveignes. Its efficiency stems from several new ingredients. For instance, we
use fast exponentiation in the modular jacobian instead of analytic
continuation, which greatly reduces the need to compute abelian integrals,
since most of the computation handles divisors. Also, we introduce an efficient
way to compute arithmetically well-behaved functions on jacobians, a method to
expand cuspforms in quasi-linear time, and a trick making the computation of
the image of a Frobenius element by a modular Galois representation more
effective. We illustrate our method on the newforms $\Delta$ and $E_4 \Delta$,
and manage to compute for the first time the associated faithful
representations modulo $\ell$ and the values modulo $\ell$ of Ramanujan's
$\tau$ function at huge primes for $\ell \in {11,13,17,19,29}$. In particular,
we get rid of the sign ambiguity stemming from the use of a non-faithful
representation as in J. Bosman's work. As a consequence, we can compute the
values of $\tau(p) \bmod 2^11.3^6.5^3.7.11.13.17.19.23.29.691 \approx
2.8.10^19$ for huge primes $p$. These representations lie in the jacobian of

positive integer k whether there is a vertex subset of size at most k that
separates all vertex pairs in G. Herein, a vertex v separates a pair {u,w} if
the distance (length of a shortest path) between v and u is different from the
distance of v and w. We give a polynomial-time computable reduction from the
Bipartite Dominating Set problem to Metric Dimension on maximum degree three
graphs such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the solution sets
of both problems. There are two main consequences of this: First, it proves
that Metric Dimension on maximum degree three graphs is W[2]-complete with
respect to the parameter k. This answers an open question concerning the
parameterized complexity of Metric Dimension posed by D\'iaz et al. [ESA'12]
and already mentioned by Lokshtanov [Dagstuhl seminar, 2009]. Additionally, it
implies that Metric Dimension cannot be solved in n^{o(k)} time, unless the
assumption FPT \neq W[1] fails. This proves that a trivial n^{O(k)} algorithm
is probably asymptotically optimal.
  Second, as Bipartite Dominating Set is inapproximable within o(log n), it
follows that Metric Dimension on maximum degree three graphs is also
inapproximable by a factor of o(log n), unless NP=P. This strengthens the
result of Hauptmann et al. [JDA 2012] who proved APX-hardness on bounded-degree
graphs.

empirical absorption profiles, we determine the 6196, 6204, and 6284 A DIB
strength toward the 219 target stars and discuss the sources of uncertainties.
In order to test the sensitivity of the DIB extraction, we intercompare the
three results and compare the DIB equivalent widths with the reddening derived
from an independent extinction map based on OGLE photometric data. Most stellar
spectra could be well reproduced by the composite stellar, atmospheric and
interstellar models. Measurement uncertainties on the EWs are smaller for the
broad and strong 6284 A DIB, and are of the order of 10-15%. Uncertainties on
the two narrow and weaker DIBs are larger, as expected, and found to be highly
variable from one target to the other. They strongly depend on the radial
velocity of the star . DIB-DIB correlations among the three bands demonstrate
that a meaningful signal is extracted. For the 6284 and 6204 A DIBs, the
star-to-star variability of the equivalent width (EW) also reflects features of

freedom with the torus geometry, which we show to be generated by a two-body
operator. We demonstrate that this operator can be used to evolve the full
torus Laughlin state at given modular parameter \tau\ from its simple
(Slater-determinant) thin torus limit, thus giving rise to a new presentation
of the torus Laughlin state in terms of its ""root partition"" and an exponential
of a two-body operator. This operator therefore generates in particular the
adiabatic evolution between Laughlin states on regular tori and the
quasi-one-dimensional thin torus limit. We make contact with the recently
introduced notion of a ""Hall viscosity"" for fractional quantum Hall states, to
which our two-body operator is naturally related, and which serves as a
demonstration of our method to generate the Laughlin state on the torus.

detailed balance and implement it for a system of hard disks on the GPU. We
reproduce results of serial high-precision Monte Carlo runs to verify the
method. This is a good test case because the hard disk equation of state over
the range where the liquid transforms into the solid is particularly sensitive
to small deviations away from the balance conditions. On a Tesla K20, our GPU
implementation executes over one billion trial moves per second, which is 148

better performance per dollar, and cuts energy usage by a factor of 13. With
this improved performance we are able to calculate the equation of state for
systems of up to one million hard disks. These large system sizes are required
in order to probe the nature of the melting transition, which has been debated

low-energy strength and giant resonances, we analyze the E1 strength as a
function of excitation energy $E$ and momentum transfer $q$. We use the
self-consistent nuclear density functional theory with Skyrme energy density
functionals, augmented by the random phase, to compute the E1 strength, and
covariance analysis to assess correlations between observables. Calculations
are performed for spherical, doubly-magic nuclei $^{208}$Pb and $^{132}$Sn. We
demonstrate that E1 transition densities in the low-energy region below the
giant dipole resonance exhibit appreciable state dependence and multi-nodal
structures, which are fingerprints of weak collectivity. The correlation
between the accumulated low-energy strength and symmetry energy is weak, and
dramatically depends on the energy cutoff assumed. On the other hand, a strong
correlation is predicted between isovector indicators and the accumulated
isovector strength at $E$ around 20 MeV and momentum transfer $q\sim 0.65$
fm$^{-1}$. Momentum- and coordinate-space pattern of the low-energy dipole
modes indicate a strong fragmentation into individual particle-hole
excitations. The global measure of low-energy dipole strength poorly correlates
with the nuclear symmetry energy and other isovector characteristics.
Consequently, our results do not support the suggestion that there exists a
collective ""pygmy dipole resonance,"" which is a strong indicator of nuclear
isovector properties.

superconducting resonator filters that provide spectral selectivity, and
Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) that detect the power admitted by each
filter resonator. The design is realized using thin-film lithographic
structures on a silicon wafer. The mm-wave microstrip feedline and spectral

to operate at hundreds of MHz and are fabricated from titanium nitride with a
Tc of 2K. Radiation incident on the horn travels along the mm-wave microstrip,
passes through the frequency-selective filter, and is finally absorbed by the
corresponding KID where it causes a measurable shift in the resonant frequency.
In this proceedings, we present the design of the KIDs employed in SuperSpec
and the results of initial laboratory testing of a prototype device. We will

infrared frequencies, whereas at optical to gamma-ray energies, the
contribution of the jet is debated. The total luminosity, and hence power of
the jet is critically dependent on the position of the break in its spectrum,
between optically thick (self-absorbed) and optically thin synchrotron
emission. This break, or turnover, has been reported in just one black hole
X-ray binary (BHXB) thus far, GX 339-4, and inferred via spectral fitting in
two others, A0620-00 and Cyg X-1. Here, we collect a wealth of multiwavelength
data from the outbursts of BHXBs during hard X-ray states, in order to search
for jet breaks as yet unidentified in their spectral energy distributions. In
particular, we report the direct detection of the jet break in the spectrum of
V404 Cyg during its 1989 outburst, at nu_b = (1.8 +- 0.3) x 10^14 Hz (1.7 +-
0.2 microns). We increase the number of BHXBs with measured jet breaks from
three to eight. Jet breaks are found at frequencies spanning more than two
orders of magnitude, from nu_b = (4.5 +- 0.8) x 10^12 Hz for XTE J1118+480
during its 2005 outburst, to nu_b > 4.7 x 10^14 Hz for V4641 Sgr in outburst. A
positive correlation between jet break frequency and luminosity is expected
theoretically; nu_b \propto L_nu,jet^~0.5 if other parameters are constant.
With constraints on the jet break in a total of 12 BHXBs including two
quiescent systems, we find a large range of jet break frequencies at similar
luminosities and no obvious global relation (but such a relation cannot be
ruled out for individual sources). We speculate that different magnetic field
strengths and/or different radii of the acceleration zone in the inner regions
of the jet are likely to be responsible for the observed scatter between
sources. (abridged)

remainder of the coherence block for correlated source generation. The
resulting secret-key involves contributions of both channel sequences and

this slope, alpha, differs from that of the field LF at these redshifts, and
with the cluster LF at low redshifts. The latter is of particular interest as
low-luminosity galaxies are expected to undergo significant evolution. We use
seven high-redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy clusters drawn from the
IRAC Shallow Cluster Survey to measure the cluster galaxy LF down to depths of
M* + 3 (3.6 microns) and M* + 2.5 (4.5 microns). The summed LF at our median
cluster redshift (z=1.35) is well fit by a Schechter distribution with
alpha[3.6] = -0.97 +/- 0.14 and alpha[4.5] = -0.91 +/- 0.28, consistent with a
flat faint end slope and is in agreement with measurements of the field LF in
similar bands at these redshifts. A comparison to alpha in low-redshift
clusters finds no statistically significant evidence of evolution. Combined
with past studies which show that M* is passively evolving out to z~1.3, this
means that the shape of the cluster LF is largely in place by z~1.3. This
suggests that the processes that govern the build up of the mass of low-mass
cluster galaxies have no net effect on the faint end slope of the cluster LF at
z<1.3.

medium and produce gamma rays as the result of inelastic proton-proton
collisions. The detection of such diffuse emission may reveal the presence of
an accelerator of cosmic rays, and also constrain the cosmic ray diffusion
coefficient in its vicinity. Preliminary results in this direction have been
obtained in the last years from studies of the gamma-ray emission from
molecular clouds located in the vicinity of supernova remnants, which are the
prime candidate for cosmic ray production. Hints have been found for a
significant suppression of the diffusion coefficient with respect to the
average one in the Galaxy. However, most of these studies rely on the
assumption of isotropic diffusion, which may not be very well justified. Here,
we extend this study to the case in which cosmic rays that escape an
accelerator diffuse preferentially along the magnetic field lines. As a first
approximation, we further assume that particles are strongly magnetized and
that their transport perpendicular to the magnetic field is mainly due to the
wandering of the field lines. The resulting spatial distribution of runaway
cosmic rays around the accelerator is, in this case, strongly anisotropic. An
application of the model to the case of the supernova remnant W28 demonstrates
how the estimates of the diffusion coefficient from gamma-ray observations
strongly depend on the assumptions made on the isotropy (or anisotropy) of
diffusion. For higher levels of anisotropy of the diffusion, larger values of
the diffusion coefficient are found to provide a good fit to data. Thus,
detailed models for the propagation of cosmic rays are needed in order to
interpret in a correct way the gamma-ray observations.

more than 99% confidence. This result suggests accretion from the intergalactic

two-temperature thermal model with solar metallicity where kT_1 = 0.1 keV and

the single-temperature model. We also find that the cooling rate in the hot gas

clumping factor during reionisation in a cosmological volume using a
high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation. We post-process the output with
detailed radiative transfer simulations to compute the escape fraction of
ionising photons. Together, this gives us the opportunity to assess the
contribution of galaxies to reionisation self-consistently. The strong mass and
redshift dependence of the escape fraction indicates that reionisation occurred
between z=15 and z=10 and was mainly driven by proto-galaxies forming in
dark-matter haloes with masses between 1e7 and 1e8 solar mass. More massive
galaxies that are rare at these redshifts and have significantly lower escape
fractions contribute less photons to the reionisation process than the
more-abundant low-mass galaxies. Star formation in the low-mass haloes is
suppressed by radiative feedback from reionisation, therefore these
proto-galaxies only contribute when the part of the Universe they live in is
still neutral. After z~10, massive galaxies become more abundant and provide
most of the ionising photons. In addition, we find that Population (Pop) III
stars are too short-lived and not frequent enough to have a major contribution
to reionisation. Although the stellar component of the proto-galaxies that
produce the bulk of ionising photons during reionisation is too faint to be
detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), these sources are brightest

We first derive a resolution criteria, based on considerations of Bondi-Hoyle
flows, that must be met in order to properly resolve the formation of accretion
disks around the secondary. We then compare simulations of binaries with three
different orbital radii (10, 15, 20 AU). Disks are formed in all three cases,
however the size of the disk and, most importantly, its accretion rate
decreases with orbital radii. In addition, the shape of the orbital motions of
material within the disk becomes increasingly elliptical with increasing binary
separation. The flow is mildly unsteady with ""fluttering"" around the bow shock
observed. The disks are generally well aligned with the orbital plane after a
few binary orbits. We do not observe the presence of any large scale, violent
instabilities (such as the flip-flop mode). For the first time, moreover, it is
observed that the wind component that is accreted towards the secondary has a
vortex tube-like structure, rather than a column-like one as it was previously
thought. In the context of AGB binary systems that might be precursors to
Pre-Planetary and Planetary Nebula, we find that the wind accretion rates at
the chosen orbital separations are generally too small to produce the most
powerful outflows observed in these systems if the companions are main sequence

that many of the more powerful PPN and PN involve closer binaries than the ones

with exchange constant J, coupled antiferromagnetically with exchange constant
J' along the diagonals of the ladder system, with periodic boundary conditions
in the shorter direction. We determine the full phase diagram of this model as
a function of spatial anisotropy, J'/J, and magnetic field. We find a rich
phase diagram, which is dominated by quantum states - phases corresponding to
the classical ground state appears only in a small region. Among the dominant
phases generated by quantum effects are commensurate and incommensurate
coplanar quasi-ordered states, which appear in the vicinity of the isotropic
region for most fields, and in the high field region for most anisotropies. The
coplanar states, while not classical ground states, can be understood
semiclassically. Even more strikingly, the largest region of phase space is
occupied by a spin density wave phase, which has incommensurate collinear
correlations along the field. This phase has no semiclassical analog, and may
be ascribed to enhanced one-dimensional (1d) fluctuations due to frustration.
Cutting across the phase diagram is a magnetization plateau, with a gap to all
excitations and up up down spin order, with a quantized magnetization equal to
1/3 of the saturation value. In the TST, this plateau extends almost but not
quite to the decoupled chains limit. Most of the above features are expected to
carry over to the two dimensional system, which we also discuss. At low field,
a dimerized phase appears, which is particular to the 1d nature of the TST, and

formation. The entropy is dominated by that of the black holes in all epochs,
and its evolution follows the same path as that of galaxies: it increases
rapidly from a low-entropy state at high redshift until z~2, then transits to a
slower growth. Our results suggest that cosmic entropy may co-evolve with

black holes in galaxies. We predict that the entropy will continue to increase

four and higher dimensions. First, using perturbative techniques, we compare
the massless and massive scalar radiation emitted by a particle radially
infalling into a Schwarzchild black hole. We show that the late-time waveform
of massive scalar perturbations is dominated by a universal oscillatory
decaying tail, which appears due to curvature effects. We also show that the
energy spectrum is in perfect agreement with a ZFL calculation once no-hair
properties of black holes are taken into account. In the second part, we study
the phenomenon of superradiance in higher dimensions and conjecture that the
maximum energy extracted from a rotating black hole can be understood in terms
of the ergoregion proper volume. We then study some consequences of
superradiance in the dynamics of moons orbiting around higher-dimensional
rotating black holes. In four-dimensional spacetime, moons around black holes
generate low-amplitude tides, and the energy extracted from the hole's rotation
is always smaller than the gravitational radiation lost to infinity. We show
that in dimensions larger than five the energy extracted from the black hole
through superradiance is larger than the energy carried out to infinity. Our
results lend strong support to the conjecture that tidal acceleration is the
rule, rather than the exception, in higher dimensions. Superradiance dominates
the energy budget and moons ""outspiral""; for some particular orbital frequency,
the energy extracted at the horizon equals the energy emitted to infinity and
""floating orbits"" generically occur. We give an interpretation of this
phenomenon in terms of the membrane paradigm and of tidal acceleration due to
energy dissipation across the horizon.

These structures are expected to be the precursors to star clusters and this
process may be the rate limiting step controling star formation rates in
galactic systems as described by the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We follow the
thermal evolution of the gas down to ~5K using extinction-dependent heating and
cooling functions. We do not yet include magnetic fields or localized stellar
feedback, so the evolution of the GMCs and clumps is determined solely by
self-gravity balanced by thermal and turbulent pressure support and the large
scale galactic shear. While cloud structures and densities change significantly
during the simulation, GMC virial parameters remain mostly above unity for time
scales exceeding the free-fall time of GMCs indicating that energy from
galactic shear and large-scale cloud motions continuously cascades down to and
within the GMCs. We implement star formation at a slow, inefficient rate of 2%
per local free-fall time, but even this yields global star formation rates that

relevant constraints from colliders, flavor physics and dark matter. We
consider three possible cases, assuming in turn that the discovered Higgs boson
is: i) the lightest Higgs boson of the model; ii) the next-to-lightest Higgs
boson; and iii) a combination of both roughly degenerate in mass. The
likelihood function for the Higgs signal uses signal rates in the \gamma\gamma\

through the \gamma\gamma, \tau\tau, ZZ and W^+W^- channels. In all cases
considered we identify the 68% and 95% credible posterior probability regions

their respective uncertainties, the first case shows strong CMSSM-like
behavior, with the stau coannihilation region featuring highest posterior
probability, the best-fit point, a correct mass of the lightest Higgs boson and
the lighter stop mass in the ballpark of 1 TeV. The second and the third cases,
on the other hand, while allowed are disfavored by the constraints from direct
detection of dark matter and from BR(B_s->\mu^+\mu^-). Without the anomalous

their longer-term impact on businesses. In the present paper, we investigate
whether the unobserved factors that make marketers run daily deals are
correlated with the unobserved factors that influence the business, In
particular, we employ the framework of seemingly unrelated regression to model
the correlation between the errors in predicting whether a business uses a
daily deal and the errors in predicting the business' survival. Our analysis
consists of the survival of 985 small businesses that offered daily deals
between January and July 2011 in the city of Chicago. Our results indicate that
there is a statistically significant correlation between the unobserved factors
that influence the business' decision to offer a daily deal and the unobserved
factors that impact its survival. Furthermore, our results indicate that the
correlation coefficient is significant in certain business categories (e.g.
restaurants).

how the bias by unresolved gas clumping may yield incorrect estimates of global

observations. We find that based on X-ray observations of narrow radial strips,
it is difficult to recover the real baryon fraction to better than 10 - 20

bright X-ray clumps in the nearby Universe (z<=0.3). We produced simple mock

brightest clumps predicted by simulations may already have been already
detected in X- ray images with a large field of view. However, their small
projected size makes it difficult to prove their existence based on X-ray

value of storage in the presence of ramp constraints and exogenous electricity
prices, and to understand the implications of the associated optimal storage
management policy on qualitative and quantitative characteristics of storage
response to real-time prices. We present an analytic characterization of the
optimal policy, along with the associated finite-horizon time-averaged value of
storage. We also derive an analytical upperbound on the infinite-horizon
time-averaged value of storage. This bound is valid for any achievable
realization of prices when the support of the distribution is fixed, and
highlights the dependence of the value of storage on ramp constraints and
storage capacity. While the value of storage is a non-decreasing function of
price volatility, due to the finite ramp rate, the value of storage saturates
quickly as the capacity increases, regardless of volatility. To study the
implications of the optimal policy, we first present computational experiments
that suggest that optimal utilization of storage can, in expectation, induce a
considerable amount of price elasticity near the average price, but little or
no elasticity far from it. We then present a computational framework for
understanding the behavior of storage as a function of price and the amount of
stored energy, and for characterization of the buy/sell phase transition region
in the price-state plane. Finally, we study the impact of market-based
operation of storage on the required reserves, and show that the reserves may

The damped density matrix for a Fock-diagonal input is written using the Weyl
expansion of the density operator. Analysis of the evolution of the
quasiprobability densities reveals the existence of two successive
characteristic times of the reservoir which are sufficient to assure the
positivity of the Wigner function and, respectively, of the $P$ representation.
We examine the time evolution of non-Gaussianity using three recently
introduced distance-type measures. They are based on the Hilbert-Schmidt
metric, the relative entropy, and the Bures metric. Specifically, for an
$M$-photon-added thermal state, we obtain a compact analytic formula of the
time-dependent density matrix that is used to evaluate and compare the three
non-Gaussianity measures. We find a good consistency of these measures on the
sets of damped states. The explicit damped quasiprobability densities are shown
to support our general findings regarding the loss of negativities of Wigner
and $P$ functions during decoherence. Finally, we point out that Gaussification
of the attenuated field mode is accompanied by a nonmonotonic evolution of the

dependence of the resistivity. Intriguingly, the resistivity perpendicular to
the CuO$_2$ planes, $\rho_c(T)$, shows both metallic ($d\rho_c/dT > 0$) and
semi-conducting ($d\rho_c/dT<0$) behavior. We shed light on this puzzle by
calculating $\rho_c$ for the two-dimensional Hubbard model within plaquette
cellular dynamical mean-field theory and strong-coupling continuous-time
quantum Monte Carlo as the impurity solver. The temperature, $T$, and doping,
$\delta$, dependencies of $\rho_c$ are controlled by the first-order transition
between pseudogap and correlated metal phases from which superconductivity can
emerge. On the large doping side of the transition $\rho_c(T)$ is metallic,
while on the low-doping side $\rho_c(T)$ changes from metallic to
semi-conducting behavior with decreasing $T$. As a function of doping, the jump
in $\rho_c$ across the first-order transition evolves into a sharp crossover at
higher temperatures. This crossover coincides with the pseudogap temperature
$T^*$ in the single-particle density of states, the spin susceptibility and
other observables. Such coincidence in crossovers is expected along the
continuation of the first-order transition into the super-critical regime,
called the Widom line. This implies that not only the dynamic and the
thermodynamic properties but also the DC transport in the normal state are
governed by the hidden first-order transition. $\rho_c(T)$ has a
high-temperature quasi-linear regime where it can exceed the Mott-Ioffe-Regel
limit and when it has a minimum it is nearly parallel to the Widom line.

auction for selling one item to multiple bidders. Generalizing this work to
selling multiple items at once has been a central question in economics and
algorithmic game theory, but its complexity has remained poorly understood. We
answer this question by showing that a revenue-optimal auction in multi-item
settings cannot be found and implemented computationally efficiently, unless
ZPP contains P^#P. This is true even for a single additive bidder whose values
for the items are independently distributed on two rational numbers with
rational probabilities. Our result is very general: we show that it is hard to
compute any encoding of an optimal auction of any format (direct or indirect,
truthful or non-truthful) that can be implemented in expected polynomial time.
In particular, under well-believed complexity-theoretic assumptions,
revenue-optimization in very simple multi-item settings can only be tractably
approximated.
  We note that our hardness result applies to randomized mechanisms in a very
simple setting, and is not an artifact of introducing combinatorial structure
to the problem by allowing correlation among item values, introducing
combinatorial valuations, or requiring the mechanism to be deterministic (whose
structure is readily combinatorial). Our proof is enabled by a
flow-interpretation of the solutions of an exponential-size linear program for
revenue maximization with an additional supermodularity constraint.

from the calculated total-energy, we discuss the route for the formation of

bulge-to-total ratio B/T = 0.26, and a weak nuclear bar. We find that the bulk
of the pseudobulge forms quickly at high redshift via a combination of
non-axisymmetric disk instabilities and tidal interactions or mergers both
occurring on dynamical timescales, not through slow secular processes at lower
redshift. Its subsequent evolution is not strictly secular either, and is
closely intertwined with the evolution of the stellar bar. In fact, the
structure that we recognize as a pseudobulge today evolves from a stellar bar
that formed at high redshift, was destroyed by minor mergers at z~3, reformed
shortly after, and weakened again following a steady gas inflow at z<1. The
gradual dissolution of the bar ensues at z=1 and continues until the present
without increasing the stellar velocity dispersion in the inner regions. In
this scenario the pseudobulge is not a separate component from the inner disk
in terms of formation path, rather it is the first step in the inside-out
formation of the baryonic disk, in agreement with the fact that pseudobulges of
massive spiral galaxies have typically a dominant old stellar population. If
our simulations do indeed reproduce the formation mechanisms of massive
spirals, then the progenitors of late-type galaxies should have strong bars and
small photometric pseudobulges at high redshift.

types of Boolean functions. In such an inverse problem, the algorithm is given
uniform random satisfying assignments of an unknown function $f$ belonging to a
class $\C$ of Boolean functions, and the goal is to output a probability
distribution $D$ which is $\epsilon$-close, in total variation distance, to the
uniform distribution over $f^{-1}(1)$.
  Positive results: We prove a general positive result establishing sufficient
conditions for efficient inverse approximate uniform generation for a class
$\C$. We define a new type of algorithm called a \emph{densifier} for $\C$, and
show (roughly speaking) how to combine (i) a densifier, (ii) an approximate
counting / uniform generation algorithm, and (iii) a Statistical Query learning
algorithm, to obtain an inverse approximate uniform generation algorithm. We
apply this general result to obtain a poly$(n,1/\eps)$-time algorithm for the
class of halfspaces; and a quasipoly$(n,1/\eps)$-time algorithm for the class
of $\poly(n)$-size DNF formulas.
  Negative results: We prove a general negative result establishing that the
existence of certain types of signature schemes in cryptography implies the
hardness of certain inverse approximate uniform generation problems. This
implies that there are no {subexponential}-time inverse approximate uniform
generation algorithms for 3-CNF formulas; for intersections of two halfspaces;
for degree-2 polynomial threshold functions; and for monotone 2-CNF formulas.
  Finally, we show that there is no general relationship between the complexity
of the ""forward"" approximate uniform generation problem and the complexity of
the inverse problem for a class $\C$ -- it is possible for either one to be
easy while the other is hard.

equations. The coefficient matrices are related to the shear module and Poisson
ratio of the material body. Compared with previous CA model for solid body,
this model realizes the natural coupling of deformations in the $x$- and $y$-

potential. The competition between RKKY interaction JRKKY and the Kondo effect,
as governed by the temperature scale TK, is known to gives rise to a rich
magnetic quantum phase diagram, the Doniach diagram. Our numerical calculations
show that in a disordered system both the Kondo temperature TK and JRKKY are
widely distributed. Accordingly, also their ratio, JRKKY /TK is widely
distributed as shown in Fig. 1 (a). However, we find a sharp cutoff of that
distribution, which allows us to define a critical density of magnetic
impurities nc below which Kondo screening wins at all sites of the system above
a critical coupling Jc, forming the Kondo phase[see Fig. 1 (b)]. As disorder is
increased, Jc increases and a spin coupled phase is found to grow at the
expense of the Kondo phase. From these distribution functions we derive the
magnetic susceptibility which show anomalous power law behavior. In the Kondo
phase that power is determined by the wide distribution of the Kondo
temperature, while in the spin coupled phase it is governed by the distribution
of JRKKY. At low densities and small J < Jc we identify a paramagnetic phase.
We also report results on a honeycomb lattice, graphene, where we find that the
spin coupled phase is more stable against Kondo screening, but is more easily
destroyed by disorder into a PM phase.

also studied the magnetic configuration of the flare via the nonlinear
force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation and the vector magnetic field observed
by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO). Continuum emission enhancement clearly appeared at the 3600
angstrom and 4250 angstrom bands, with peak contrasts of 25% and 12%,
respectively. The continuum emission enhancement closely coincided with the
impulsive increase in the hard X-ray emission and a microwave type III burst at
03:40 UT. We find that the WLF appeared at one end of either the sheared or
twisted field lines or both. There was also a long-lasting phase in the H-alpha
and soft X-ray bands after the white-light emission peak. In particular, a
second, yet stronger, peak appeared at 03:56 UT in the microwave band. This
event shows clear evidence that the white-light emission was caused by
energetic particles bombarding the lower solar atmosphere. A two-step magnetic
reconnection scenario is proposed to explain the entire process of flare
evolution, i.e., the first-step magnetic reconnection between the field lines
that are highly sheared or twisted or both, and the second-step one in the
current sheet, which is stretched by the erupting flux rope. The WLF is
supposed to be triggered in the first-step magnetic reconnection at a
relatively low altitude.

proposed new methodology allows variations in atomic density inside the grain

observed by varying temperature or injecting point defects into the boundary
region. Due to the presence of multiple metastable phases, grain boundaries can
absorb significant amounts of point defects created inside the material by
processes such as irradiation. We propose a novel mechanism of radiation damage
healing in metals which may guide further improvements in radiation resistance
of metallic materials through grain boundary engineering.

addition, cessation or restarting of the jet power and obstruction of the jet
will also result in distinct morphological structures. The radio source
population may thus be classified in morphological types that indicate the
prevailing physical processes. Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) occupy the
earliest evolutionary phase of symmetric radio sources and their dynamical
behavior is fundamental for any further evolution. Analysis of CSO dynamics is
presented for a sample of 24 CSOs with known redshift and hotspot separation

kinematic age of the source are found to be generally consistent with the

dynamic resource allocation where the resource concerned may be assigned more
flexibility than is allowed, for example, in classical multi-armed bandits.
Most especially we have in mind the allocation of a divisible resource
(manpower, money, equipment) to a collection of objects (projects) requiring it
in cases where its over-concentration would usually be far from optimal. The
resulting project indices are functions of both a resource level and a state.
They have a simple interpretation as a fair charge for increasing the resource
available to the project from the specified resource level when in the
specified state. We illustrate ideas by reference to two model classes which
are of independent interest. In the first, a pool of servers is assigned
dynamically to a collection of service teams, each of which mans a service
station. We demonstrate indexability under a natural assumption that the
service rate delivered is increasing and concave in the team size. The second
model class is a generalization of the spinning plates model for the optimal
deployment of a divisible investment resource to a collection of reward
generating assets. Asset indexability is established under appropriately drawn
laws of diminishing returns for resource deployment. For both model classes
numerical studies provide evidence that the proposed greedy index heuristic
performs strongly.

question of mesoscopic local reality for a massive system. In that case, EPR's
""elements of reality"" are defined for the oscillator, and it is these elements
of reality that are falsified (if quantum mechanics is complete). For this sort
of paradox, we show that a thermal barrier exists, meaning that a threshold
level of pulse-oscillator interaction is required for a given thermal
occupation n_0 of the oscillator. We find there is no equivalent thermal
barrier for the entanglement of the pulse with the oscillator, nor for the EPR

integer points in a polygon in $\mathbb{R}^2$ whose vertices are also integer
points. Lattice triangulations have been studied extensively both as geometric
objects in their own right and by virtue of applications in algebraic geometry.
Our focus is on random triangulations in which a triangulation $\sigma$ has
weight $\lambda^{|\sigma|}$, where $\lambda$ is a positive real parameter, and
$|\sigma|$ is the total length of the edges in $\sigma$. Empirically, this
model exhibits a ""phase transition"" at $\lambda=1$ (corresponding to the
uniform distribution): for $\lambda<1$ distant edges behave essentially
independently, while for $\lambda>1$ very large regions of aligned edges
appear. We substantiate this picture as follows. For $\lambda<1$ sufficiently
small, we show that correlations between edges decay exponentially with
distance (suitably defined), and also that the Glauber dynamics (a local Markov
chain based on flipping edges) is rapidly mixing (in time polynomial in the
number of edges in the triangulation). This dynamics has been proposed by
several authors as an algorithm for generating random triangulations. By
contrast, for $\lambda>1$ we show that the mixing time is exponential. These
are apparently the first rigorous quantitative results on the structure and
dynamics of random lattice triangulations.

adoptig a model that contains two cupper d-orbitals derived from
first-principles band calculations, where the dz2 orbital is considere on top
of the usually considered dx2-y2 orbital. In that paper, we have identified two
origins for the Tc enhancement under hydrostatic pressure: (i) while at ambient
pressure the smaller the hybridization of other orbital components the higher
the Tc, an application of pressure acts to reduce the multiorbital mxing on the
Fermi surface, which we call the orbital distillation effects, and (ii) the
increase of the band width with pressure also contributes to the enhancement.
In the present paper, we further elabolrate the two points. As for point (i),
while the reduction of the apical oxygen height under pressure tends to
increase the dz2 mixture, hence to lower Tc, here we show that this effect is
strongly reduced in bi-layer materials due to the pyramidal coordination of
oxygen atoms. As for point (ii), we show that the enhancement of Tc due to the
increase in the band width is caused by the effect that the many-body
renormalization arising from the self-energy is reduced.

conventional pilot-assisted schemes using the extra phase rotations within one

adjacent OFDM blocks. Analytical expressions of the variances and biases are
derived. Extensive simulation results indicate significant performance
improvements over conventional schemes. Additionally, effects of several noise

planets accretion models to explain their mass distribution. In particular,
formation of sub-jovian planets remains unclear, given the short timescale for
the runaway accretion of massive atmospheres. However, gas needs to pass
through a circum-planetary disc. If the latter has a low viscosity (as expected
if planets form in ""dead zones""), it might act as a bottleneck for gas
accretion. We investigate what the minimum accretion rate is for a planet under
the limit assumption that the circum-planetary disc is totally inviscid, and
the transport of angular momentum occurs solely because of the gravitational
perturbations from the star. To estimate the accretion rate, we present a
steady-state model of an inviscid circum-planetary disc, with vertical gas
inflow and external torque from the star. Hydrodynamical simulations of a
circum-planetary disc were conducted in 2D, in a planetocentric frame, with the
star as an external perturber in order to measure the torque exerted by the
star on the disc. The disc shows a two-armed spiral wave caused by stellar
tides, propagating all the way in from the outer edge of the disc towards the
planet. The stellar torque is small and corresponds to a doubling time for a
Jupiter mass planet of the order of 5 Myrs. Given the limit assumptions, this
is clearly a lower bound of the real accretion rate. This result shows that gas
accretion onto a giant planet can be regulated by circum-planetary discs. This
suggests that the diversity of masses of extra-solar planets may be the result
of different viscosities in these discs.

a systematic IBP algorithm that works for arbitrary N and leads to an integrand

also optimized with respect to gauge invariance. In the photon case this means
manifest transversality at the integrand level, in the gluon case that a form
factor decomposition of the amplitude into transversal and longitudinal parts
is generated naturally by the IBP, without the necessity to consider the
nonabelian Ward identities. Our algorithm is valid off-shell, and provides an
extremely efficient way of calculating the one-loop one-particle-irreducible
off-shell Green's functions (`vertices') in QCD. It can also be applied

with a spin-orbit coupling along one spatial axis, a detuning field, and a
Zeeman field. We show theoretically that the presence of all three results in
interesting and unusual phenomena in such systems in the presence of a contact
singlet attraction between the fermions (described by a scattering length). For
two particles, bound states appear over certain range of the centre of mass
momenta when a critical positive scattering length is attained, with the
deepest bound state appearing at a nonzero centre of mass momentum. For the
centre of mass momenta without a bound state, the gauge field induces a
resonance like feature in the scattering continuum resulting in a large
scattering phase shift. For many particles, we demonstrate that the system, in
a parameter range, shows flow enhanced pairing, i.e., a more robust superfluid
at finite centre of mass momentum. Yet another regime of parameters offers the
opportunity to study strongly interacting normal states of spin-orbit coupled
fermionic systems utilizing the resonance like feature induced by the synthetic
gauge field.

shadowing, scattering of sunlight, selfheating and thermal-infrared beaming
(re-radiation of absorbed sunlight back towards the Sun as a result of surface
roughness). The model is verified by accurately reproducing ground-based
directional thermal emission measurements of the lunar surface using surface
properties that are consistent with the findings of the Apollo missions and
roughness characterised by an RMS slope of ~32 degrees. By considering the wide
range of potential asteroid surface properties, the model implies a beaming
effect that cannot be described by a simple parameter or function. It is highly
dependent on the illumination and viewing angles as well as surface thermal
properties and is predominantly caused by macroscopic rather than microscopic
roughness. Roughness alters the effective Bond albedo and thermal inertia of
the surface as well as moving the mean emission away from the surface normal.
For accurate determination of surface properties from thermal-infrared
observations of unresolved bodies or resolved surface elements, roughness must
be explicitly modelled, preferably aided with thermal measurements at different
emission angles and wavelengths.

are robust and the transition point experiences a shift ${\cal O}(n L^2)$.

the Hamiltonian operator in a rotating frame, as compared with the one in an

non-uniqueness of H and E really is a physical problem. We compute the energy
operator in the inertial and the rotating frame, using three tetrad fields: one
for each of two frameworks proposed to select the tetrad field so as to solve
this non-uniqueness problem, and one proposed by Ryder. We find that Mashhoon's
term is there if the tetrad rotates as does the reference frame --- but then it
is also there in the energy operator for the inertial frame. In fact, the Dirac
Hamiltonian operators in two reference frames in relative rotation, but
corresponding to the same tetrad field, differ only by the angular momentum
term. If the Mashhoon effect is to exist for a Dirac particle, the tetrad field
must be selected in a specific way for each reference frame.

formation of very high temperature plasma. The properties of the thermal
emission are not well understood, however, and the analysis of solar flare
observations is often predicated on the assumption that the flare plasma is
isothermal. The EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO) provides spectrally resolved observations of emission lines
that span a wide range of temperatures (e.g., Fe XV-Fe XXIV) and allow for
thermal flare plasma to be studied in detail. In this paper we describe a
method for computing the differential emission measure distribution in a flare
using EVE observations and apply it to several representative events. We find
that in all phases of the flare the differential emission measure distribution
is broad. Comparisons of EVE spectra with calculations based on parameters
derived from the GOES soft X-ray fluxes indicate that the isothermal
approximation is generally a poor representation of the thermal structure of a
flare.

to the strong viscous damping of the cantilever resonance. Here we show that a
high-quality resonance (Q>20) can be achieved in aqueous solution by attaching
a microgram-bead at the end of the nanogram-cantilever. The resulting increase
in cantilever mass causes the resonance frequency to drop significantly.
However, the force sensitivity --- as expressed via the minimum detectable
force gradient --- is hardly affected, because of the enhanced quality factor.
Via the enhancement of the quality factor, the attached bead also reduces the
relative importance of noise in the deflection detector. It can thus yield an
improved signal-to-noise ratio when this detector noise is significant. We
describe and analyze these effects for a set-up which includes magnetic
actuation of the cantilevers and which can be easily implemented in any AFM
system that is compatible with an inverted optical microscope.

masses of elementary particles come from? Inspired by observation of the
empirical particle mass spectrum we propose that the masses of elementary
particles arise solely due to the self-interaction of the fields associated
with a particle. We thus assume that the mass is proportional to the strength
of the interaction of the field with itself. A simple application of this idea
to the fermions is seen to yield a mass for the neutrino in line with
constraints from direct experimental upper limits and correct order of
magnitude predictions of mass separations between neutrinos, charged leptons
and quarks. The neutrino interacts only through the weak force, hence becomes
light. The electron interacts also via electromagnetism and accordingly becomes
heavier. The quarks also have strong interactions and become heavy. The photon
is the only fundamental particle to remain massless, as it is chargeless.
Gluons gain mass comparable to quarks, or slightly larger due to a somewhat
larger color charge.
  Including particles outside the standard model proper, gravitons are not
exactly massless, but very light due to their very weak self-interaction.
  Some immediate and physically interesting consequences arise: i) Gluons have
an effective range $\sim 1$fm, physically explaining why QCD has finite reach
ii) Gravity has an effective range $\sim 100$ Mpc coinciding with the largest
known structures; the cosmic voids iii) Gravitational waves undergo dispersion
even in vacuum, and have all five polarizations (not just the two of $m=0$),
which might explain why they have not yet been detected.
