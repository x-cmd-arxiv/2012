recover the structure of the branched double cover (and flat nontrivial B

measurements of the signal strength \mu_{\gamma\gamma} by ATLAS and CMS.
However, the large Yukawa interactions tend to drive the Higgs quartic coupling
negative at a low scale \Lambda < 10 TeV, and as such new physics is required
to stabilize the electroweak vacuum. A plausible option, which does not rely on
supersymmetry, is that the Higgs in fact has a much larger tree level quartic
coupling than in the Standard Model, which is possible with an extended scalar
sector. We investigate in detail the minimal model with a new real singlet
scalar which condenses and mixes with the Higgs. The mechanism is very
efficient when the singlet is heavier than the weak scale m_s ~ O(TeV), in
which case the vacuum can be stable and the couplings can be perturbative up to
scales \Lambda ~ 10^9 GeV while \mu_{\gamma\gamma} = 1.7. On the other hand,
for a singlet at the weak scale, a substantial shift in the Higgs quartic
coupling requires sizable Higgs-singlet mixing. Such mixing can be utilized to
further enhance \mu_{\gamma\gamma} through Yukawa couplings of the singlet to
the vector-like leptons. In this case, for an enhancement \mu_{\gamma\gamma}
\sim 1.7 it is possible to obtain a stable vacuum up to scales \Lambda ~ 1000
TeV. The singlet can have significant mixing with the Higgs particle, allowing
for its resonant production via gluon fusion at the LHC, and can be searched
for through Higgs like decays and decays to vector-like leptons, which can lead
to multi-lepton final states. We also comment on UV extensions of the minimal

for damping times due to the shear and bulk viscosities. These formulas
describe both normal and superfluid neutron stars and are valid for oscillation
modes of arbitrary multipolarity. We show that: (i) use of the ordinary
one-fluid hydrodynamics is a good approximation, for most of the stellar
temperatures, if one is interested in calculation of the damping times of
normal f-modes; (ii) for radial and p-modes such an approximation is poor;

and learning problems such as hypothesis testing, clustering, dimensionality
reduction, classification, among others. However, the use of information
theoretic quantities as test statistics, that is, as quantities obtained from
empirical data, poses a challenging estimation problem that often leads to
strong simplifications such as Gaussian models, or the use of plug in density
estimators that are restricted to certain representation of the data. In this
paper, a framework to non-parametrically obtain measures of entropy directly
from data using operators in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces defined by
infinitely divisible kernels is presented. The entropy functionals, which bear
resemblance with quantum entropies, are defined on positive definite matrices
and satisfy similar axioms to those of Renyi's definition of entropy.
Convergence of the proposed estimators follows from concentration results on
the difference between the ordered spectrum of the Gram matrices and the
integral operators associated to the population quantities. In this way,
capitalizing on both the axiomatic definition of entropy and on the
representation power of positive definite kernels, the proposed measure of
entropy avoids the estimation of the probability distribution underlying the
data. Moreover, estimators of kernel-based conditional entropy and mutual
information are also defined. Numerical experiments on independence tests
compare favourably with state of the art.

notion of horosphere in Lorentzian geometry and take a completely different

are defined in terms of 'achronal limits', and the improved regularity we
obtain is based on regularity properties of achronal boundaries. We establish a
splitting result for generalized horospheres, which when specialized to 'Cauchy

competing evolutionary scenarios, understand the population or populations that
produce RCBs and constraint their formation rate. The ASAS-3 survey monitored
the sky south of declination +28 deg since 2000 to a limiting magnitude of
V=14. We searched ASAS-3 for RCB variables using a number of different methods
to ensure that the probability of RCB detection was as high as possible and to
reduce selection biases based on luminosity, temperature, dust production
activity and shell brightness. Candidates whose light curves were visually
inspected were pre-selected based on their infrared excesses due to warm dust
in their circumstellar shells using the WISE and/or 2MASS catalogues, and
criteria on light curve variability. We then acquired spectra of 104 stars to
determine their real nature using the SSO/WiFeS spectrograph. We report 21
newly-discovered RCB stars and 2 new DY Per stars. Two previously suspected RCB
candidates were also spectroscopically confirmed. Our methods allowed us to

Galactic RCB stars is consistent with RCBs being part of the Galactic bulge

Specifically, we investigate the quantum Larmor radiation from a moving charge

quantum electrodynamics at the lowest order of the perturbation theory. Using
the in-in formalism, we derive the theoretical formula of the total radiation
energy from a charged particle in the initial states being at rest and being in

compared with the prediction of the classical Larmor formula, which is a
contrast to the previous work. The reason is explained by the fact that the
radiation from a moving charge in a monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave is
expressed in terms of the inelastic collisions between an electron and photons

localized states and measurements, which are unmanageable by quantum field
theory. The automaton theory is a very promising framework for quantum gravity,
since it is quantum ab-initio, with relativistic covariance as emergent and not
assumed a priori, it is free from all the problems arising from the continuum,
it doesn't suffer violations of causality, and has no divergences. It is the
natural scenario to accommodate the quantum holographic principle. Lorentz
covariance and all other symmetries are violated in the ultrarelativistic
Planckian regime, but are perfectly recovered at the Fermi-scale.
  In the present report, after briefly reviewing the fundamental principles at
the basis of the quantum cellular automata extension of quantum field theory, I

(9,7), (10,7), (9,9), (10,9), and (12,12) transitions, are classified as masers
for the first time in outer space. All detected masers are related to highly
excited inversion doublets. The (5,4) maser originates from an inversion
doublet 340 K above the ground state, while the (12,12) transition, at 1450 K,
is the most highly excited NH3 maser line so far known. Strong variability is
seen not only in ortho- but also in para-NH3 transitions. Bright narrow
emission features are observed, for the first time, in (mostly) ortho-ammonia
transitions, at V ~ 45 km/s, well separated from the quasi-thermal emission
near 60 km/s. These features were absent 25 years ago and show a velocity drift
of about +0.2 km/s/yr. The component is likely related to the SiO maser source
in W51-IRS2 and a possible scenario explaining the velocity drift is outlined.
The 57 km/s component of the (9,6) maser line is found to be strongly linearly
polarized. Maser emission in the (J,K) to (J+1,K) inversion doublets is
strictly forbidden by selection rules for electric dipole transitions in the
ground vibrational state. However, such pairs (and even triplets with (J+2,K))
are common toward W51-IRS2. Similarities in line widths and velocities indicate
that such groups of maser lines arise from the same regions, which can be
explained by pumping through vibrational excitation. The large number of NH3
maser lines in W51-IRS2 is most likely related to the exceptionally high
kinetic temperature and NH3 column density of this young massive star forming
region.

  welcome!",,,,"quant-ph cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A measurement consists in coupling a system to a probe and reading the output
of the probe to gather information about the system. The weaker the coupling,
the smaller the back-action on the system, but also the less information
conveyed. If the system undergoes a second measurement, the statistics of the
first output can be conditioned on the value of the second one. This procedure
is known as postselection. A postselected weak measurement of an observable can
give a large average output of the probe when the postselected state is nearly
orthogonal to the initial state of the system. This large value is an
interference effect in the readout of the probe, which is initially in a
coherent superposition of readout states (also known as pointer states).
Usually, the weak interaction between system and probe is considered
instantaneous, so that the dynamics of the probe can be neglected. However, for
a weak measurement in solid-state devices, an interaction of finite duration is
likely needed.
  Here, we show how this finite duration generates a contribution of the
dynamical phase to the readout statistics. Furthermore, we derive interpolation
formulas that are able to describe the statistics of the weak measurement for
the whole range of pre- and postselected states. Phase-space averages appear in
the expansion, suggesting an interpretation in terms of non-positive
probabilities. Decoherence in the probe is also accounted for and it is pointed
out the existence of a regime of intermediate coupling strength in which
coherent oscillations can be observed in the probability of the readout.

$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ calculations per iteration (significantly smaller than the
$\mathcal{O}(N^3) $ calculations for Newton's iterations or gradient descent
approaches). Furthermore, the algorithm converges very fast (usually in less
than 15 iterations), and in particular, if initialized close to the optimal
solution, the convergence speed is much faster. This suggests the potential of
tracking variations in slowly fading channels. Finally, when implemented in a
distributed fashion, the algorithm attains the optimal power vector with a
signaling/computational complexity of only $\mathcal{O}(N)$ at each node.

stochastic geometry to study geometric routing schemes in wireless ad-hoc
networks. In particular, we analyze the network layer performance of one such
scheme, the random $\frac{1}{2}$disk routing scheme, which is a localized
geometric routing scheme in which each node chooses the next relay randomly
among the nodes within its transmission range and in the general direction of
the destination. The techniques developed in this paper enable us to establish
the asymptotic connectivity and the convergence results for the mean and
variance of the routing path lengths generated by geometric routing schemes in
random wireless networks. In particular, we approximate the progress of the
routing path towards the destination by a Markov process and determine the
sufficient conditions that ensure the asymptotic connectivity for both dense
and large-scale ad-hoc networks deploying the random $\frac{1}{2}$disk routing
scheme. Furthermore, using this Markov characterization, we show that the
expected length (hop-count) of the path generated by the random
$\frac{1}{2}$disk routing scheme normalized by the length of the path generated
by the ideal direct-line routing, converges to $3\pi/4$ asymptotically.
Moreover, we show that the variance-to-mean ratio of the routing path length
converges to $9\pi^2/64-1$ asymptotically. Through simulation, we show that the

Duman","A Note on the Deletion Channel Capacity","Submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Memoryless channels with deletion errors as defined by a stochastic channel
matrix allowing for bit drop outs are considered in which transmitted bits are
either independently deleted with probability $d$ or unchanged with probability
$1-d$. Such channels are information stable, hence their Shannon capacity
exists. However, computation of the channel capacity is formidable, and only
some upper and lower bounds on the capacity exist. In this paper, we first show
a simple result that the parallel concatenation of two different independent
deletion channels with deletion probabilities $d_1$ and $d_2$, in which every
input bit is either transmitted over the first channel with probability of
$\lambda$ or over the second one with probability of $1-\lambda$, is nothing
but another deletion channel with deletion probability of $d=\lambda
d_1+(1-\lambda)d_2$. We then provide an upper bound on the concatenated
deletion channel capacity $C(d)$ in terms of the weighted average of $C(d_1)$,
$C(d_2)$ and the parameters of the three channels. An interesting consequence
of this bound is that $C(\lambda d_1+(1-\lambda))\leq \lambda C(d_1)$ which
enables us to provide an improved upper bound on the capacity of the i.i.d.
deletion channels, i.e., $C(d)\leq 0.4143(1-d)$ for $d\geq 0.65$. This
generalizes the asymptotic result by Dalai as it remains valid for all $d\geq
0.65$. Using the same approach we are also able to improve upon existing upper
bounds on the capacity of the deletion/substitution channel.

differential lensing distortion of the X-ray and optical emission, assuming
several corona geometries. The strong lensing X-ray-to-optical magnification
ratio can change by a factor of ~10 for normal quasars in some cases, and
another factor of ~10 for broad absorption line quasars (BALs) and obscured

affected by the space-time geometry. As found in previous studies in the
literature, there is a strong correlation between the spin parameter and the
deformation parameter; that is, the line emitted around a Kerr black hole with
a certain spin can be very similar to the one coming from the space-time around
a non-Kerr object with a quite different spin. Despite that, the analysis of
the broad K$\alpha$ iron line is potentially more powerful than the

deviations from the Kerr geometry independently of the value of the spin

  2013","10.2495/BEM360351",,"cs.NA math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  The kernel-independent fast multipole method (KIFMM) proposed in [1] is of
almost linear complexity. In the original KIFMM the time-consuming M2L
translations are accelerated by FFT. However, when more equivalent points are
used to achieve higher accuracy, the efficiency of the FFT approach tends to be
lower because more auxiliary volume grid points have to be added. In this
paper, all the translations of the KIFMM are accelerated by using the singular
value decomposition (SVD) based on the low-rank property of the translating
matrices. The acceleration of M2L is realized by first transforming the
associated translating matrices into more compact form, and then using low-rank
approximations. By using the transform matrices for M2L, the orders of the
translating matrices in upward and downward passes are also reduced. The
improved KIFMM is then applied to accelerate BEM. The performance of the
proposed algorithms are demonstrated by three examples. Numerical results show
that, compared with the original KIFMM, the present method can reduce about 40%
of the iterating time and 25% of the memory requirement.

the degree-descending order. Our arguments are supported by the numerical

a $\beta$-plane solved using an alternating direction fully implicit (ADI)
finite-difference scheme on a rectangular domain. The scheme was shown to be
unconditionally stable for the linearized equations.
  The discretization yields a number of nonlinear systems of algebraic
equations. We then use a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) to reduce the
dimension of the SWE model. Due to the model nonlinearities, the computational
complexity of the reduced model still depends on the number of variables of the
full shallow - water equations model. By employing the discrete empirical
interpolation method (DEIM) we reduce the computational complexity of the
reduced order model due to its depending on the nonlinear full dimension model
and regain the full model reduction expected from the POD model.
  To emphasize the CPU gain in performance due to use of POD/DEIM, we also
propose testing an explicit Euler finite difference scheme (EE) as an
alternative to the ADI implicit scheme for solving the swallow water equations
model.
  We then proceed to assess the efficiency of POD/DEIM as a function of number
of spatial discretization points, time steps, and POD basis functions. As was
expected, our numerical experiments showed that the CPU time performances of
POD/DEIM schemes are proportional to the number of mesh points. Once the number
of spatial discretization points exceeded 10000 and for 90 DEIM interpolation
points, the CPU time was decreased by a factor of 10 in case of POD/DEIM
implicit SWE scheme and by a factor of 15 for the POD/DEIM explicit SWE scheme
in comparison with the corresponding POD SWE schemes. Our numerical tests
revealed that if the number of points selected by DEIM algorithm reached 50,
the approximation errors due to POD/DEIM and POD reduced systems have the same

binary system WOCS 23009 in the old open cluster NGC 6819 that contains both an
evolved star near central hydrogen exhaustion and a low-mass (0.45 Msun) star.
This system was previously known to be a single-lined spectroscopic binary, but
the discovery of an eclipse near apastron using data from the Kepler space
telescope makes it clear that the system has an inclination that is very close
to 90 degrees. Although the secondary star has not been identified in spectra,
the mass of the primary star can be constrained using other eclipsing binaries
in the cluster. The combination of total eclipses and a mass constraint for the
primary star allows us to determine a reliable mass for the secondary star and
radii for both stars, and to constrain the cluster age. Unlike well-measured
stars of similar mass in field binaries, the low-mass secondary is not
significantly inflated in radius compared to model predictions. The primary
star characteristics, in combination with cluster photometry and masses from
other cluster binaries, indicates a best age of 2.62+/-0.25 Gyr, although
stellar model physics may introduce systematic uncertainties at the ~10% level.
We find preliminary evidence that the asteroseismic predictions for red giant
masses in this cluster are systematically too high by as much as 8%.

flow, J -- moving queue) lead to traffic breakdown at the light signal. Both
spontaneous and induced breakdowns of the green wave have been found. From a
study of a variety of scenarios for arrival traffic, we have found that there
are the infinite number of capacities of traffic at the light signal, which are
in a capacity range between a minimum capacity and maximum capacity; each of
the capacities gives a flow rate at which under-saturated traffic is in a
metastable state with respect to the transition to over-saturated traffic. The
maximum capacity depends crucially on a time-dependence of the flow rate: The

macroscopic-microscopic method, the Skyrme energy-density functional and the
isospin symmetry in nuclear physics. The rms deviation with respect to 2149
known nuclear masses falls to 336 keV, and the rms deviations from 1988 neutron
separation energies and \alpha-decay energies of 46 super-heavy nuclei are
significantly reduced to 286 and 248 keV, respectively. The predictive power of
the mass formula for describing new measured masses in GSI and those in AME2011
is excellent. In addition, we introduce an efficient and powerful systematic
method, radial basis function approach, for further improving the accuracy and
predictive power of global nuclear mass models.

connected negative definite plumbing graph. We show that its Seiberg-Witten
invariants equal certain coefficients of an equivariant multivariable Ehrhart
polynomial. For this, we construct the corresponding polytopes from the
plumbing graphs together with an action of the first homology of M, and we
develop Ehrhart theory for them. At an intermediate level we define the
`periodic constant' of multivariable series and establish their properties. In
this way, one identifies the Seiberg-Witten invariant of a plumbed 3-manifold,
the periodic constant of its `combinatorial zeta-function', and a coefficient
of the associated Ehrhart polynomial. We make detailed presentations for graphs
with at most two nodes. The two node case has surprising connections with the
theory of affine monoids of rank two.

size due to the introduction of a recycling procedure. However, the consistency
of the AMIS estimator remains largely open. In this work we prove the
convergence of the AMIS, at a cost of a slight modification in the learning
process. Contrary to Douc et al. (2007a), results are obtained here in the

shapes, is an important process in different research areas. Conformal mappings
have been widely used to obtain a diffeomorphism between shapes that minimizes
angular distortion. Conformal registrations are beneficial since it preserves
the local geometry well. However, when landmark constraints are enforced,
conformal mappings generally do not exist. This motivates us to look for a
unique landmark matching quasi-conformal registration, which minimizes the
conformality distortion. Under suitable condition on the landmark constraints,
a unique diffeomporphism, called the Teichm\""uller extremal mapping between two
surfaces can be obtained, which minimizes the maximal conformality distortion.
In this paper, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm, called the
Quasi-conformal (QC) iterations, to compute the Teichm\""uller mapping. The
basic idea is to represent the set of diffeomorphisms using Beltrami
coefficients (BCs), and look for an optimal BC associated to the desired
Teichm\""uller mapping. The associated diffeomorphism can be efficiently
reconstructed from the optimal BC using the Linear Beltrami Solver(LBS). Using
BCs to represent diffeomorphisms guarantees the diffeomorphic property of the
registration. Using our proposed method, the Teichm\""uller mapping can be
accurately and efficiently computed within 10 seconds. The obtained
registration is guaranteed to be bijective. The proposed algorithm can also be
extended to compute Teichm\""uller mapping with soft landmark constraints. We
applied the proposed algorithm to real applications, such as brain landmark
matching registration, constrained texture mapping and human face registration.
Experimental results shows that our method is both effective and efficient in
computing a non-overlap landmark matching registration with least amount of
conformality distortion.

consequence of a phase transition occurring in the compression stage of a
nuclear collision. It is a combined effect of the softest point inherent in an
equation of state (EoS) with a phase transition and a change in the
nonequilibrium dynamics from hadronic to partonic transport. Thus, this
irregularity is a signal from a hot and dense stage of the nuclear collision.
In order to illustrate this proposition, calculations within the three-fluid
model were performed with three different EoS's: a purely hadronic EoS, an EoS
with a first-order phase transition and that with a smooth crossover
transition. It is found that predictions within the first-order-transition
scenario indeed reveal an a strong irregularity in the incident energy
dependence of the form of the net-proton rapidity distributions in central
collisions. This behavior is in contrast to that for the hadronic scenario,
where the distribution form gradually evolve, displaying no irregularity. The
case of the crossover EoS is intermediate. Only a weak irregularity takes
place. Experimental data also exhibit a trend of similar irregularity, which is
however based on still preliminary data at energies of 20A GeV and 30A GeV.

of 7x10^24 erg at Earth within up to one year in AD 774/5 (Miyake et al. 2012).
A normal supernova and a solar or stellar flare are unlikely as cause (Miyake
et al. 2012), so that the source remained unknown. Here, we show that a short
gamma-ray burst (GRB) in our Galaxy is consistent with all observables: Such an
event is sufficiently short and provides the necessary energy in the relevant
spectral range of $\gamma$-rays. Its spectral hardness is consistent with the
differential production rates of 14C and 10Be as observed. The absence of
reports about a historic sighting of a supernova in AD 774/5 or a present-day
supernova remnant are also consistent with a short GRB. We estimate the
distance towards this short GRB to be ~ 1 to 4 kpc - sufficiently far away, so
that no extinction event on Earth was triggered. This is the first evidence for
a short GRB in our Galaxy.

  Parameters: A Random Walk in the Cosmological Parameter Space",,,,,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  What do the data, as distinguished from cosmological models, tell us about
cosmological parameters that determined the model of the universe? In this
paper, we address this question in the context of the WMAP angular power
spectra for the cosmic microwave background radiation. Nonparametric methods
are ideally suited for this purpose because they are model-independent by
construction, and therefore allow inferences that are as data-driven as
possible. Our analysis is based on a nonparametric fit to the WMAP 7-year power
spectrum data, with uncertainties characterized in the form of a
high-dimensional confidence set centered at this fit. For the purpose of making
inferences about cosmological parameters, we have devised a sampling method to
explore the projection of this confidence set around the nonparametric fit,
into the space of seven cosmological parameters Omega_b, Omega_c, Omega_Lambda,
Omega_k, H_0, n_s, tau). Our sampling method is justified by its computational
simplicity, and validated by the fact that well-known degeneracies in this
cosmological parameter space are correctly reproduced in our results. Our
results show that cosmological parameters are not as tightly constrained by
these data alone. However, incorporating additional prior information in the
analysis (e.g., constraining the values of H_0 or Omega_k) leads to tighter
confidence intervals on parameters that are consistent with uncertainties
estimated by the mainstream parametric methods.

relaxation of an electron beam is known to produce Langmuir waves which, in
turn, may substantially modify the electron distribution function. As the
Langmuir waves are refracted by background density gradients and as the solar
and heliospheric plasma density is naturally perturbed with various levels of
inhomogeneity, the interaction of Langmuir waves with non-thermal electrons in
inhomogeneous plasmas is an important topic. We investigate the role played by
ambient density fluctuations on the beam-plasma relaxation, focusing on the
effect of acceleration of beam electrons. The scattering of Langmuir waves off
turbulent density fluctuations is modeled as a wavenumber diffusion process
which is implemented in numerical simulations of the one-dimensional
quasilinear kinetic equations describing the beam relaxation. The results show
that a substantial number of beam electrons are accelerated when the diffusive
time scale in wavenumber space \tau_D is of the order of the quasilinear time
scale \tau_ql, while when \tau_D << \tau_ql, the beam relaxation is suppressed.
Plasma inhomogeneities are therefore an important means of energy
redistribution for waves and hence electrons, and so must be taken into account
when interpreting, for example, hard X-ray or Type III emission from
flare-accelerated electrons.

rather than decreases with growing temperature. The magnetic sensitivity of
Stokes profiles depends primarily on the magnetic field conditions. The
response of V profiles is the greatest under the weak-field and

estimation problems. By developing a tool on simultaneous diagonalization of
two positive definite kernels, we obtain shaper results on the minimax rates of
convergence and show that smoothness regularized estimators achieve the optimal
rates of convergence for both prediction and estimation under conditions weaker
than those for the functional principal components based methods developed in
the literature. Despite the generality of the method of regularization, we show
that the procedure is easily implementable. Numerical results are obtained to
illustrate the merits of the method and to demonstrate the theoretical
developments.

distribution (SED) of BL Lacertae objects, simultaneous broad-band observations
are mandatory. Aims. We present the results of a dedicated multi-wavelength
study of the high-frequency peaked BL Lacertae (HBL) object and known TeV
emitter 1ES 2344+514 by means of a pre-organised campaign. Methods. The
observations were conducted during simultaneous visibility windows of MAGIC and
AGILE in late 2008. The measurements were complemented by Mets\""ahovi,
RATAN-600, KVA+Tuorla, Swift and VLBA pointings. Additional coverage was
provided by the ongoing long-term F-GAMMA and MOJAVE programs, the OVRO 40-m
and CrAO telescopes as well as the Fermi satellite. The obtained SEDs are
modelled using a one-zone as well as a self-consistent two-zone synchrotron
self-Compton model. Results. 1ES 2344+514 was found at very low flux states in
both X-rays and very high energy gamma rays. Variability was detected in the
low frequency radio and X-ray bands only, where for the latter a small flare
was observed. The X-ray flare was possibly caused by shock acceleration
characterised by similar cooling and acceleration time scales. MOJAVE VLBA
monitoring reveals a static jet whose components are stable over time scales of
eleven years, contrary to previous findings. There appears to be no significant
correlation between the 15 GHz and R-band monitoring light curves. The
observations presented here constitute the first multi-wavelength campaign on
1ES 2344+514 from radio to VHE energies and one of the few simultaneous SEDs
during low activity states. The quasi-simultaneous Fermi-LAT data poses some
challenges for SED modelling, but in general the SEDs are described well by
both applied models. The resulting parameters are typical for TeV emitting
HBLs. Consequently it remains unclear whether a so-called quiescent state was
found in this campaign.

to understand the fundamentals of the plasma behaviour and its properties.
Mathematical models used to investigate these plasma are still need to be
matured. Especially, the relativistic quantum electron-ion plasma are modeled
using the Klein-Gordon equation and the Dirac equation for relativistic
electrons. However, different properties of these plasma are investigated
without anti-particles. We note that in order to preserve causality
relativistic quantum plasma must contain anti-particles for relativistically
dynamical components of the plasma.

we perform full coherent control of the ground-biexciton state qubit and
observe an extended coherence time using an all-optical echo technique. The

three-dimensional correlation function of the transmitted flux fraction in the
\Lya forest of high-redshift quasars. The study uses 48,640 quasars in the
redshift range $2.1\le z \le 3.5$ from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS) of the third generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS-III). At a mean redshift $z=2.3$, we measure the monopole and quadrupole
components of the correlation function for separations in the range
$20\hMpc<r<200\hMpc$. A peak in the correlation function is seen at a
separation equal to $(1.01\pm0.03)$ times the distance expected for the BAO
peak within a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. This first detection of the
BAO peak at high redshift, when the universe was strongly matter dominated,
results in constraints on the angular diameter distance $\da$ and the expansion
rate $H$ at $z=2.3$ that, combined with priors on $H_0$ and the baryon density,
require the existence of dark energy. Combined with constraints derived from
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations, this result implies
$H(z=2.3)=(224\pm8){\rm km\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$, indicating that the time
derivative of the cosmological scale parameter $\dot{a}=H(z=2.3)/(1+z)$ is
significantly greater than that measured with BAO at $z\sim0.5$. This
demonstrates that the expansion was decelerating in the range $0.7<z<2.3$, as
expected from the matter domination during this epoch. Combined with
measurements of $H_0$, one sees the pattern of deceleration followed by
acceleration characteristic of a dark-energy dominated universe.

implement crossing symmetry, in order to shed further light on the
long-standing puzzle in the parameters of the f0(500), as well as the f0(980).
This puzzle is finally being settled thanks to several analyses carried out
during the last years. In this talk we show how our very recent dispersive data
analysis allowed for a precise and model independent determination of the
amplitudes for the S,P,D and F waves. In particular, we show how the analytic
continuation of once subtracted dispersion relations for the S0 wave to the
complex energy plane leads to very precise results for the f0(500) pole:
sqrt(s)_pole = 457^(+14)_(-13) - i 279^(+11)_(-7) MeV and for the f0(980) pole:
sqrt(s)_pole = 996+/-7 - i 25^(+10)_(-6) MeV. We also comment on how these
results have been already used for other practical applications, including a
refit of a previous model to the pipi S-wave amplitudes below 1000 MeV, which
improves its consistency with the poles found with the dispersive approach.

correlation between the spectral index from 10 GHz to 1350 $\AA$ and the amount
of excess luminosity in the red wing of quasar CIV $\lambda$1549 broad emission
lines (BELs). Ostensibly, the prominence of the red excess is associated with
the radio jet emission mechanism and is most pronounced for lines of sight
close to the jet axis. Studying the scant significant differences in the UV
spectra of radio loud and radio quiet quasars might provide vital clues to the
origin of the unknown process that creates powerful relativistic jets that
appear in only about ten percent of quasars. In this study, the phenomenon is
explored with multi-epoch observations of the MgII $\lambda$2798 broad line in
3C 279 which has one of the largest known redwing excesses in a quasar
spectrum. The amount of excess that is detected appears to be independent of
all directly observed optical continuum, radio or submm properties (fluxes or
polarizations). The only trend that occurs in this sparse data is: the stronger
the BEL, the larger the fraction of flux that resides in the redwing. It is
concluded that more monitoring is needed and spectropolarimetry with a large
telescope is essential during low states to understand more.

many other longitudinal data can be represented by an empirical first order
stochastic ordinary differential equation with time-varying coefficients and a
smooth drift process. This equation may be empirically obtained from
longitudinal observations for a sample of subjects and does not presuppose
specific knowledge of the underlying processes. For the nonparametric
estimation of the components of the differential equation, it suffices to have
available sparsely observed longitudinal measurements which may be noisy and
are generated by underlying smooth random trajectories for each subject or
experimental unit in the sample. The drift process that drives the equation
determines how closely individual process trajectories follow a deterministic
approximation of the differential equation. We provide estimates for
trajectories and especially the variance function of the drift process. At each
fixed time point, the proposed empirical dynamic model implies a decomposition
of the derivative of the process underlying the longitudinal data into a
component explained by a linear component determined by a varying coefficient
function dynamic equation and an orthogonal complement that corresponds to the
drift process. An enhanced perturbation result enables us to obtain improved
asymptotic convergence rates for eigenfunction derivative estimation and
consistency for the varying coefficient function and the components of the
drift process. We illustrate the differential equation with an application to
the dynamics of on-line auction data.

addition to producing colourful tessellations these reactions are naturally
computing generalised Voronoi diagrams of the plane. The reactions reported
previously were capable of the calculation of three distinct Voronoi diagrams
of the plane. As diffusion coupled with a chemical reaction is responsible for
the calculation then this is achieved in parallel. Thus an increase in the
complexity of the data input does not utilise additional computational
resource. Additional benefits of these chemical reactions is that a permanent
record of the Voronoi diagram calculation (in the form of precipitate free
bisectors) is achieved, so there is no requirement for further processing to
extract the calculation results. Previously it was assumed that the permanence
of the results was also a potential drawback which limited reusability. This
paper presents new data which shows that sequential Voronoi diagram
calculations can be performed on the same chemical substrate. This is dependent
on the reactivity of the original reagent and the cross reactivity of the
secondary reagent with the primary product. We present the results from a
number of binary combinations of metal salts on both potassium ferricyanide and
potassium ferrocyanide substrates. We observe three distinct mechanisms whereby
secondary sequential Voronoi diagrams can be calculated. In most cases the
result was two interpenetrating permanent Voronoi diagrams. This is interesting
from the perspective of mapping the capability of unconventional computing

This study focuses on reducing the memory consumption of PPM via the recently
proposed compressed context modeling that uses the compressed representations
of contexts in the statistical model. Differently from the classical context
definition as the string of the preceding characters at a particular position,
CCM considers context as the amount of preceding information that is actually
the bit stream composed by compressing the previous symbols. We observe that by
using the CCM, the data structures, particularly the context trees, can be
implemented in smaller space, and present a trade-off between the compression
ratio and the space requirement. The experiments conducted showed that this
trade-off is especially beneficial in low orders with approximately 20 - 25
percent gain in memory by a sacrifice of up to nearly 7 percent loss in
compression ratio.

Proper
motion data exist for only two of the M31 satellites. We account for this
incompleteness in velocity data by a statistical analysis using a combination
of the timing argument and phase-space distribution functions. The bulk of the
M31 satellites are well fit by these models and we offer a table of orbital
properties, including period, eccentricity and semi-major axis. This enables us
to search for evidence of group infall based on orbital similarity rather than
propinquity on the sky. Our results favour an association between Cass II and
NGC 185, as the orbital parameters are in close agreement, but not for NGC 185
and NGC 147, which have often been associated in the past. Other possible
satellite groupings include the pair And I and And XVII; the pair And IX and
And X; and the triple And V, And XXV and NGC 147. And XXII has been claimed as
a satellite of M33; we find that they are not moving independently along the
same orbit, but cannot determine whether they are orbiting each other or are
unrelated. Two satellites, And XII and And XIV, have high line-of-sight
velocities, consistent with very recent infall from the edge of the Local
Group. They are not well described by our underlying smooth phase space
distribution function, and are reanalysed without priors on their orbital
parameters. For And XIV, multiple pericentric passages are possible and
improved distance information is needed to draw further conclusions. For And

production of a Higgs boson in space by dark matter annihilations. We
investigate the cases where the Higgs boson is produced at rest or slightly
boosted and show that such configurations can produce characteristic bumps in
the gamma-ray data. These results are relevant in the case of the Standard
Model-like Higgs boson provided that the dark matter mass is about 63 GeV, 109
GeV or 126 GeV, but can be generalised to any other Higgs boson masses. Here,
we point out that it may be worth looking for a 63 GeV line since it could be
the signature of the decay of a Standard Model-like Higgs boson produced in
space, as in the case of a di-Higgs final state if m_DM ~ 126 GeV. We show that
one can set generic constraints on the Higgs boson production rates using its
decay properties. In particular, using the Fermi-LAT data from the galactic
center, we find that the dark matter annihilation cross section into gamma + a
Standard Model-like Higgs boson produced at rest or near rest cannot exceed
<sigma v> ~ a few 10^-25 cm^3/s or <sigma v> ~ a few 10^-27 cm^3/s
respectively, providing us with information on the Higgs coupling to the dark
matter particle. We conclude that Higgs bosons can indeed be used as messengers
to explore the dark matter mass range.

cooling; repeated cycles generate gravitational potential fluctuations
responsible for irreversible modifications of the dark matter mass profile. The

of the Higgs triplet model, in which tiny neutrino masses are generated via the

at unity at tree level. In the GM model, there are 5-plet ($H_5$), 3-plet
($H_3$) and singlet ($H_1$) Higgs bosons under the classification of the
custodial $SU(2)_V$ symmetry, in addition to the standard model-like Higgs
boson ($h$). These new Higgs bosons have the following characteristic features
at the tree level: (1) the masses of the Higgs bosons belonging to the same
$SU(2)_V$ multiplet are degenerate; and (2) $H_5$ and $H_1$ couple to the
electroweak gauge bosons but not SM quarks, whereas $H_3$ couples to the quarks
but not the gauge bosons. We find that the $H_5$ production from the weak
vector boson fusion process and the Drell-Yan process associated with $H_3$ are
useful in testing the custodial symmetry of the Higgs sector at the LHC. In
addition, these processes can also be used to discriminate from other models
that contain singly-charged Higgs bosons and extra neutral Higgs bosons. We
also investigate a possible enhancement in the $h\to \gamma\gamma$ as well as

there necessarily exists at least one multiple eigenvalue and further
constraints arise in various special cases. For example, when ${\rho}$ is

eigenvalues of ${\rho}$ coincide and such spacetimes thus correspond to the

solution of several poorly constrained inverse problems. Here we address one of
these problems, namely to deduce from the projected aspect ratios of the cores
in Ophiuchus their intrinsic three-dimensional shapes. Four models are
proposed, all based on the standard assumption that cores are randomly
orientated ellipsoids, and on the further assumption that a core's shape is not
correlated with its absolute size. The first and simplest model, M1, has a
single free parameter, and assumes that the relative axes of a core are drawn
randomly from a log-normal distribution with zero mean and standard deviation
\sigma o. The second model, M2a, has two free parameters, and assumes that the
log-normal distribution (with standard deviation \sigma o) has a finite mean,
\mu o, defined so that \mu o<0 means elongated (prolate) cores are favoured,
whereas \mu o>0 means flattened (oblate) cores are favoured. Details of the
third model (M2b, two free parameters) and the fourth model (M4, four free
parameters) are given in the text. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and
Bayesian analysis are used to map out the posterior probability density
functions of the model parameters, and the relative merits of the models are
compared using Bayes factors. We show that M1 provides an acceptable fit to the
Ophiuchus data with \sigma o ~ 0.57+/-0.06; and that, although the other models
sometimes provide an improved fit, there is no strong justification for the
introduction of their additional parameters.

  of Theorem 16). Several clarifications and typos fixed in various places",,,,"cs.DS cs.CC math.PR math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study a new framework for property testing of probability distributions,
by considering distribution testing algorithms that have access to a
conditional sampling oracle.* This is an oracle that takes as input a subset $S
\subseteq [N]$ of the domain $[N]$ of the unknown probability distribution $D$
and returns a draw from the conditional probability distribution $D$ restricted
to $S$. This new model allows considerable flexibility in the design of
distribution testing algorithms; in particular, testing algorithms in this
model can be adaptive.
  We study a wide range of natural distribution testing problems in this new
framework and some of its variants, giving both upper and lower bounds on query
complexity. These problems include testing whether $D$ is the uniform
distribution $\mathcal{U}$; testing whether $D = D^\ast$ for an explicitly
provided $D^\ast$; testing whether two unknown distributions $D_1$ and $D_2$
are equivalent; and estimating the variation distance between $D$ and the
uniform distribution. At a high level our main finding is that the new
""conditional sampling"" framework we consider is a powerful one: while all the
problems mentioned above have $\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ sample complexity in the
standard model (and in some cases the complexity must be almost linear in $N$),
we give $\mathrm{poly}(\log N, 1/\varepsilon)$-query algorithms (and in some
cases $\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)$-query algorithms independent of $N$) for
all these problems in our conditional sampling setting.
  *Independently from our work, Chakraborty et al. also considered this
framework. We discuss their work in Subsection [1.4].

the cluster cradles, we observed with the PdBI in the most extended
configuration the continuum at 1.3 mm and the CO(2-1) emission of four massive
cores. We detect dust condensations down to ~0.3 Msun and separate millimeter
sources down to 0.4"" or ~1000 AU, comparable to the sensitivities and
separations reached in optical/infrared studies of clusters. The CO(2-1) high
angular resolution images reveal high-velocity knots usually aligned with
previously known outflow directions. This, in combination with additional cores
from the literature observed at similar mass sensitivity and spatial
resolution, allowed us to build a sample of 18 protoclusters with luminosities
spanning 3 orders of magnitude. Among the 18 regions, ~30% show no signs of
fragmentation, while 50% split up into ~4 millimeter sources. We compiled a
list of properties for the 18 massive dense cores, such as bolometric
luminosity, total mass, and mean density, and found no correlation of any of
these parameters with the fragmentation level. In order to investigate the
combined effects of magnetic field, radiative feedback and turbulence in the
fragmentation process, we compared our observations to radiation
magneto-hydrodynamic simulations, and found that the low-fragmented regions are
well reproduced in the magnetized core case, while the highly-fragmented
regions are consistent with cores where turbulence dominates over the magnetic
field. Overall, our study suggests that the fragmentation in massive dense
cores could be determined by the initial magnetic field/turbulence balance in
each particular core.

22 GHz and CH3OH 6.7 GHz masers, and single-epoch VLBI of the OH 1.6 GHz
masers. Water masers present a symmetric spatial distribution with respect to
the HMC center, where two nearby (0.2"" apart), compact, VLA sources (labeled
""A"" and ""B"") are previously detected. The spatial distribution of a first group
of water masers, named ""J1"", is well fit with an elliptical profile, and the
maser proper motions mainly diverge from the ellipse center, with average speed
of 36 km s-1. These findings strongly suggest that the ""J1"" water maser group
traces the heads of a young (dynamical time of 1.3 10^3 yr), powerful (momentum
rate of ~0.2 M_sun yr-1 km s-1), collimated (semi-opening angle ~10 deg) jet
emerging from a MYSO located close (within 0.15"") to the VLA source ""B"". Most
of the water features not belonging to ""J1"" present an elongated (about 2"" in
size), NE--SW oriented (PA = 70 deg), S-shape distribution, which we denote
with the label ""J2"". The elongated distribution of the ""J2"" group and the
direction of motion, approximately parallel to the direction of elongation, of
most ""J2"" water masers suggests the presence of another collimated outflow,
emitted from a MYSO near the VLA source ""A"". The orientation of the ""J2"" jet
agrees well with that (PA = 68 deg) of the well-defined V_LSR gradient across
the HMC revealed by previous interferometric, thermal line observations.
Furthermore, the ""J2"" jet is powerful enough to sustain the large momentum
rate, 0.3 M_sun yr-1 km s-1, estimated assuming that the V_LSR gradient
represents a collimated outflow. These two facts lead us to favour the
interpretation of the V_LSR gradient across the G31.41+0.31 HMC in terms of a
compact and collimated outflow.

path with non-negative edge capacities and tasks, which are characterized by a
subpath, a demand, and a profit. The goal is to find the most profitable subset
of tasks whose total demand does not violate the edge capacities. This problem
naturally arises in many settings such as bandwidth allocation, resource
constrained scheduling, and interval packing.
  A natural task classification defines the size of a task i to be the ratio
delta between the demand of i and the minimum capacity of any edge used by i.
If all tasks have sufficiently small delta, the problem is already well
understood and there is a 1+eps approximation. For the complementary
setting---instances whose tasks all have large delta---much remains unknown,
and the best known polynomial-time procedure gives only (for any constant
delta>0) an approximation ratio of 6+eps.
  In this paper we present a polynomial time 1+eps approximation for the latter
setting. Key to this result is a complex geometrically inspired dynamic
program. Here each task is represented as a segment underneath the capacity
curve, and we identify a proper maze-like structure so that each passage of the
maze is crossed by only O(1) tasks in the computed solution. In combination
with the known PTAS for delta-small tasks, our result implies a 2+eps
approximation for UFP, improving on the previous best 7+eps approximation
[Bonsma et al., FOCS 2011]. We remark that our improved approximation factor
matches the best known approximation ratio for the considerably easier special
case of uniform edge capacities.

of several molecular clouds proximately located in projected distance. The
X-ray spectra of Sgr C were analyzed on the basis of a view that XRNe are
located inside the Galactic center plasma X-ray emission with an oval
distribution around Sgr A*. We found that the XRNe are largely separated in the
line-of-sight position, and are associated with molecular clouds in different
velocity ranges detected by radio observations. We also applied the same
analysis to the Sgr B XRNe and completed a long-term light curve for Sgr A*
occurring in the past. As a new finding, we determined that Sgr A* was
experiencing periods of high luminosity already 500 years ago, which is longer
than the previously reported value. Our results are consistent with a scenario
that Sgr A* was continuously active with sporadic flux variabilities of Lx =
1-3 x 10^39 erg s^-1 in the past 50 to 500 years. The average past luminosity
was approximately 4-6 orders of magnitude higher than that presently observed.
In addition, two short-term flares of 5-10 years are found. Thus, the past
X-ray flare should not be a single short-term flare, but can be interpreted as
multiple flares superposed on a long-term high state.
