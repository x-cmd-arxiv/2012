systems. Perturbations can be applied to each trajectory independently (white
noise) or simultaneously to all trajectories (random map). We compare these two
scenarios by generalizing the theory of open chaotic systems and introducing a
time-dependent conditionally-map-invariant measure. For the same perturbation
strength we show that the escape rate of the random map is always larger than
that of the noisy map. In random maps we show that the escape rate $\kappa$ and
dimensions $D$ of the relevant fractal sets often depend nonmonotonically on
the intensity of the random perturbation. We discuss the accuracy (bias) and
precision (variance) of finite-size estimators of $\kappa$ and $D$, and show
that the improvement of the precision of the estimations with the number of
trajectories $N$ is extremely slow ($\propto 1/\ln N$). We also argue that the
finite-size $D$ estimators are typically biased. General theoretical results
are combined with analytical calculations and numerical simulations in
area-preserving baker maps.

developed. The theory extends from a droplet model, with the additional
consideration of a lipid membrane separating two fluids of arbitrary
properties. For the latter, both a membrane-charging and a membrane-mechanical
model are supplied. The vesicle is assumed to remain spheroidal in shape for
all times. The main result is an ODE governing the evolution of the vesicle
aspect ratio. The effects of initial membrane tension and pulse length are
examined. The model prediction is extensively compared with experimental data,
and is shown to accurately capture the system behavior in the regime of no or
weak electroporation. More importantly, the comparison reveals that vesicle
relaxation obeys a universal behavior regardless of the means of deformation.
The process is governed by a single timescale that is a function of the vesicle
initial radius, the fluid viscosity, and the initial membrane tension. This
universal scaling law can be used to calculate membrane properties from
experimental data.

minimizing contention and interference among co-channel devices and thereby

proposed for frequency allocation in such networks, however they do not address
the problem end-to-end. In this paper, we present a general formulation of the
channel selection problem taking into account the performance of both
mesh-access and mesh-backhaul. Moreover, we propose ARACHNE, a routing-aware
channel selection protocol for wireless mesh networks. ARACHNE is distributed
in nature, and motivated by our measurements on a wireless testbed. The main
novelty of our protocol comes from adopting a metric that captures the
end-to-end link loads across different routes in the network. ARACHNE
prioritizes the assignment of low-interference channels to links that (a) need
to serve high-load aggregate traffic and/or (b) already suffer significant
levels of contention and interference. Our protocol takes into account the
number of potential interfaces (radios) per device, and allocates these
interfaces in a manner that efficiently utilizes the available channel
capacity. We evaluate ARACHNE through extensive, tracedriven simulations and we
show that approaches the optimal channel selection. We observe that our
protocol improves the total network throughput, as compared to three other
representative channel allocation approaches in literature.

inputs within their current range of uncertainty: 1H(p,nu e+)2H,
14N(p,gamma)15O, and triple-alpha reaction rates, radiative and conductive
opacities, neutrino energy losses, and microscopic diffusion velocities. We
performed a systematic variation on a fixed grid, in a way to obtain a full
crossing of the perturbed input values. The effect of the variations of the
chosen physical inputs on relevant stellar evolutionary features, such as the
turn-off luminosity, the central hydrogen exhaustion time, the red-giant branch
(RGB) tip luminosity, the helium core mass, and the ZAHB luminosity in the RR
Lyrae region are statistically analyzed. For a 0.9 Msun model, the cumulative

for $\pm$ 0.02 dex, $\pm$ 0.03 dex, and $\pm$ 0.045 dex respectively, while the
central hydrogen exhaustion time varies of about $\pm$ 0.7 Gyr. The most
relevant effect is due to the radiative opacities uncertainty; for the later
evolutionary stages the second most important effect is due to the triple-alpha
reaction rate uncertainty. For an isochrone of 12 Gyr, we find that the
isochrone turn-off log luminosity varies of $\pm$ 0.013 dex, the mass at the

3-5 hours, leading to an extremely sharp relative linewidth of Delta E/E ~

The frequencies of the largest amplitude peaks were found matching within 3.7
microHz the known low-degree (l = 0--3) modes of global acoustic oscillations,
and can be explained by a leakage of the global modes into the corona. Due to
strong variability of the solar atmosphere between the photosphere and the
corona the frequencies and amplitudes of the coronal oscillations are likely to
vary with time. We investigate the variations in the power spectra for
individual days and their association with changes of solar activity, e.g. with
the mean level of the EUV irradiance, and its short-term variations due to
evolving active regions. Our analysis of samples of one-day oscillation power
spectra for a 49-day period of low and intermediate solar activity showed
little correlation with the mean EUV irradiance and the short-term variability
of the irradiance. We suggest that some other changes in the solar atmosphere,

and inductive generation of locales (formal covers), commutative quantales

our abstract treatment of convergence, we are able to specify categorically the
precise sense according to which our inductively generated structures are free,
thus refining Johnstone's coverage theorem. We also obtain a natural and

trying to detect targets, sparsely populated in the radar's unambiguous
time-frequency region. Several past works employ compressed sensing (CS)
algorithms to this type of problem, but either do not address sample rate
reduction, impose constraints on the radar transmitter, propose CS recovery
methods with prohibitive dictionary size, or perform poorly in noisy
conditions. Here we describe a sub-Nyquist sampling and recovery approach
called Doppler focusing which addresses all of these problems: it performs low
rate sampling and digital processing, imposes no restrictions on the
transmitter, and uses a CS dictionary with size which does not increase with
increasing number of pulses P. Furthermore, in the presence of noise, Doppler
focusing enjoys an SNR increase which scales linearly with P, obtaining good
detection performance even at SNRs as low as -25dB. The recovery is based on
the Xampling framework, which allows reducing the number of samples needed to
accurately represent the signal, directly in the analog-to-digital conversion
process. After sampling, the entire digital recovery process is performed on
the low rate samples without having to return to the Nyquist rate. Finally, our
approach can be implemented in hardware using a previously suggested Xampling
prototype.

of finding the optimum solution in the state space among which the desired
solution resides. The algorithm mimics the principles of bat sonar in finding
its targets. The algorithm introduces three search approaches. The first search
approach considers a single sonar unit (SSU) with a fixed beam length and a
single starting point. In this approach, although the results converge toward
the optimum fitness, it is not guaranteed to find the global optimum solution
especially for complex problems; it is satisfied with finding 'acceptably good'
solutions to these problems. The second approach considers multisonar units
(MSU) working in parallel in the same state space. Each unit has its own
starting point and tries to find the optimum solution. In this approach the
probability that the algorithm converges toward the optimum solution is
significantly increased. It is found that this approach is suitable for complex
functions and for problems of wide state space. In the third approach, a single
sonar unit with a moment (SSM) is used in order to handle the problem of
convergence toward a local optimum rather than a global optimum. The momentum
term is added to the length of the transmitted beams. This will give the chance
to find the best fitness in a wider range within the state space. In this paper
a comparison between the proposed algorithm and genetic algorithm (GA) has been
made. It showed that both of the algorithms can catch approximately the optimum
solutions for all of the testbed functions except for the function that has a
local minimum, in which the proposed algorithm's result is much better than
that of the GA algorithm. On the other hand, the comparison showed that the
required execution time to obtain the optimum solution using the proposed
algorithm is much less than that of the GA algorithm.

systems throughout the fields of optics, medicine or biology. Dissipative
solitons can also exist in Kerr-nonlinear optical resonators and rely on the
double balance between parametric gain and resonator loss on the one hand and
nonlinearity and diffraction or dispersion on the other hand. Mathematically
these solitons are solution to the Lugiato-Lefever equation and exist on top of
a continuous wave (cw) background. Here we report the observation of temporal
dissipative solitons in a high-Q optical microresonator. The solitons are
spontaneously generated when the pump laser is tuned through the effective zero
detuning point of a high-Q resonance, leading to an effective red-detuned
pumping. Red-detuned pumping marks a fundamentally new operating regime in
nonlinear microresonators. While usually unstablethis regime acquires unique
stability in the presence of solitons without any active feedback on the
system. The number of solitons in the resonator can be controlled via the pump
laser detuning and transitions to and between soliton states are associated
with discontinuous steps in the resonator transmission. Beyond enabling to
study soliton physics such as soliton crystals our observations open the route
towards compact, high repetition-rate femto-second sources, where the operating
wavelength is not bound to the availability of broadband laser gain media. The
single soliton states correspond in the frequency domain to low-noise optical
frequency combs with smooth spectral envelopes, critical to applications in
broadband spectroscopy, telecommunications, astronomy and low phase-noise

both internally dense (to the extent given by the parameter \beta), and
externally sparse (to the extent given by the parameter \alpha) . With this
definition of clustering, we show the existence of a size threshold of (\ln

a.a.s. clusters larger than (\ln n)^{1/2-\epsilon} exist, whereas a.a.s.

first systematic survey of the inner Galactic plane in the sub-millimetre. The
observations were carried out with the Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA), an
array of 295 bolometers observing at 870 microns (345 GHz). Aims. Here we
present a first version of the compact source catalogue extracted from this
survey. This catalogue provides an unbiased database of dusty clumps in the
inner Galaxy. Methods. The construction of this catalogue was made using the
source extraction routine SExtractor. We have cross-associated the obtained
sources with the IRAS and MSX catalogues, in order to constrain their nature.
Results. We have detected 6639 compact sources in the range from 330 < l < 21
degrees and |b| < 1.5 degrees. The catalogue has a 99% completeness for sources
with a peak flux above 6 sigma, which corresponds to a flux density of ~0.4
Jy/beam. The parameters extracted for sources with peak fluxes below the 6
sigma completeness threshold should be used with caution. Tests on simulated
data find the uncertainty in the flux measurement to be ~12%, however, in more
complex regions the flux values can be overestimated by a factor of 2 due to
the additional background emission. Using a search radius of 30"" we found that
40% of ATLASGAL compact sources are associated with an IRAS or MSX point
source, but, ~50% are found to be associated with MSX 21 microns fluxes above
the local background level, which is probably a lower limit to the actual
number of sources associated with star formation. Conclusions. Although
infrared emission is found towards the majority of the clumps detected, this
catalogue is still likely to include a significant number of clumps that are
devoid of star formation activity and therefore excellent candidates for
objects in the coldest, earliest stages of (high-mass) star formation.

chromospheric lines, in quiescent prominences that propagate from large (~10
Mm) bubbles that form at the base of the prominences. These plumes present a
very interesting opportunity to study Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena in
quiescent prominences, but obstacles still remain. One of the biggest issues is
that of the magnetic field strength, which is not easily measurable in
prominences. In this paper we present a method that may be used to determine a
prominence's plasma \beta when rising plumes are observed. Using the classic
fluid dynamic solution for flow around a circular cylinder with an MHD
correction, the compression of the prominence material can be estimated. This
has been successfully confirmed through simulations; application to a
prominence gave an estimate of the plasma beta as \beta=0.47 to 1.13 with an
error of 0.080 for the range \gamma=1.4 to 1.7. Using this method it may be
possible to estimate the plasma beta of observed prominences, therefore helping
our understanding of a prominence's dynamics in terms of MHD phenomena.

fraction of the Galaxy's baryons are embedded within an extended,
million-degree hot halo, an idea supported indirectly by observations of warm
gas clouds in the halo and gas-free dwarf spheroidal satellites. X-ray
observations have established that hot gas does exist in our Galaxy beyond the
local hot bubble; however, it may be distributed in a hot disk configuration.
Moreover, recent investigations into the X-ray constraints have suggested that
any Galactic corona must be insignificant. Here we re-examine the observational
data, particularly in the X-ray and radio bands, in order to determine whether
it is possible for a substantial fraction of the Galaxy's baryons to exist in ~
10^6 K gas. In agreement with past studies, we find that a baryonically closed
halo is clearly ruled out if one assumes that the hot corona is distributed
with a cuspy NFW profile. However, if the hot corona of the galaxy is in an
extended, low-density distribution with a large central core, as expected for
an adiabatic gas in hydrostatic equilibrium, then it may contain up to 10^11
M_sun of material, possibly accounting for all of the missing Galactic baryons.

topological insulators and quantum spintronics. It gives rise to the

this work, we predict a new form of the spin-orbital texture associated with
the p$_x$ and p$_y$ orbitals. For the upper Dirac cone, a left-handed
(right-handed) spin texture is coupled to the ""radial"" (""tangential"") orbital
texture, whereas for the lower Dirac cone, the coupling of spin and orbital
textures is the exact opposite. The ""tangential"" (""radial"") orbital texture is
dominant for the upper (lower) Dirac cone, leading to the right-handed spin
texture for the in-plane orbitals of both the upper and lower Dirac cones. A

radiation. Although the synchrotron model has been discussed in previous
studies, it requires a strong magnetic field which leads to a severe
suppression of the TeV gamma-ray flux in conflict with H.E.S.S. observations.
In this paper, we calculate the IC emission by low energy electrons (\gamma_e
\lesssim 10^3) in the Thomson regime. We find that IC emission of the low
energy electrons can explain the X-ray flux and spectrum observed with Suzaku
if the minimum Lorentz factor of injected electrons \gamma_min is around 10^3.
In addition, we show that the Suzaku light curve is well reproduced if
\gamma_min varies in proportion to the Fermi flux when the distribution
function of injected electrons at higher energies is fixed. We conclude that
the emission from LS 5039 is well explained by the model with the IC emission
from electrons whose injection properties are dependent on the orbital phase.
Since the X-ray flux is primarily determined by the total number of cooling
electrons, this conclusion is rather robust, although some mismatches between
the model and observations at the GeV band remain in the present formulation.

The growth of the dynamic length scale with decreasing temperature is
characterized by various scaling relations that are analogous to the critical

three-time correlation function to characterize the temporal structures of the
dynamic heterogeneities based on our previous studies. We provide comprehensive

heterogeneities becomes much longer than the alpha relaxation time determined
from a two-point correlation function in fragile liquids. The decoupling
between the two time scales is remarkable, particularly in supercooled states,

be observed, even for the isotropic single layer plate. Finite element
simulations agree perfectly with the present warping functions in these cases.
For multilayer cross-ply configurations, the warping functions are determined
using a semi-analytical procedure. They have been compared to results of 3D
finite element simulations. They are in excellent agreement. For angle-ply
laminates, the above process gives warping functions that seem to have relevant
shapes, even if the choice for global shear values cannot be justified in this
case. No finite element comparison has been presented at this time because it
is difficult to propose boundary conditions and prescribed load that permit to
isolate the shear phenomenon.

in the observable at a given mass as a fundamental parameter. This work
computes the amplitude of the scatter for a newly introduced mass proxy, the
product of the cluster total luminosity times the mass-to-light ratio, usually
referred as stellar mass. The analysis of 12 galaxy clusters with excellent
total masses shows a tight correlation between the stellar mass, or stellar
fraction, and total mass within r500 with negligible intrinsic scatter: the 90%
upper limit is 0.06 dex, the posterior mean is 0.027 dex. This scatter is
similar to the one of best-determined mass proxies, such as Yx, i.e. the
product of X-ray temperature and gas mass. The size of the cluster sample used
to determine the intrinsic scatter is small, as in previous works proposing
low-scatter proxies because very accurate masses are needed to infer very small
values of intrinsic scatter. Three-quarters of the studied clusters have lgM
<~14 Msol, which is advantageous from a cosmological perspective because these
clusters are far more abundant than more massive clusters. At the difference of
other mass proxies such as Yx, stellar mass can be determined with survey data
up to at least z=0.9 using upcoming optical near-infrared surveys, such as DES
and Euclid, or even with currently available surveys, covering however smaller
solid angles. On the other end, the uncertainty about the predicted mass of a
single cluster is large, 0.21 to 0.32 dex, depending on cluster richness. This
is largely because the proxy itself has ~0.10 dex errors for clusters of lgM<~
14 Msol mass.

simple observation that when the energy is quantized it is not possible to make
variations with respect to the energy, and the time parameterisation
t-t_0=\partial_E S_0, implied by Jacobi's theorem and that leads to group
velocity, is ill defined. It should be stressed that this follows directly form
the quantum HJ equation without any axiomatic assumption concerning the
standard formulation of quantum mechanics. This provides a stringent connection
between the quantum HJ equation and the Copenhagen interpretation. Together
with tunneling and the energy quantization theorem for confining potentials,
formulated in the framework of quantum HJ equation, it leads to the main
features of the axioms of quantum mechanics from a unique geometrical
principle. Similarly to the case of the classical HJ equation, this fixes its
quantum analog by requiring that there exist point transformations, rather than
canonical ones, leading to the trivial hamiltonian. This is equivalent to a
basic cocycle condition on the states. Such a cocycle condition can be
implemented on compact spaces, so that continuous energy spectra are allowed
only as a limiting case. Remarkably, a compact space would also imply that the
Dirac and von Neumann formulations of quantum mechanics essentially coincide.
We suggest that there is a definition of time parameterisation leading to
trajectories in the context of the quantum HJ equation having the probabilistic
interpretation of the Copenhagen School.

Lagrangian framework is developed to incorporate surface energy into
elasticity. Besides the Euler-Lagrange equation and natural boundary condition,
a new boundary constitutive equation is derived from the variation of the
Lagrangian and configuration on which the Lagrangian is defined. On the
boundary surface, explicit expression of the vector potential with respect to
field variable and surface curvature is determined. Based on this framework, an
elastic model with relevance to the surface energy is established. The
Young-Laplace's formula is generalized into elastic solid in a new form. Making
use of this model, we investigate the surface energy effect in the radial
vibration of spherical nanoparticle. Numerical calculation shows that natural
frequencies of nanoparticle will shift down due to the surface energy. This
shift is especially apparent in the vibration of soft matter nanoparticles.

the number of colours N, and the magnetic flux m. The size of the torus acts a
parameter that allows to control the onset of non-perturbative effects. In the
small volume regime, where perturbation theory holds, we derive the one-loop

discuss the transition from small to large volumes that has been investigated

e, for the lowest gluon momentum, depends solely on e/N and on the
dimensionless variable x=lambda N l, with lambda the 't Hooft coupling. The
variable x can be interpreted as the dimensionless 't Hooft coupling for an

addition, the method is suitable for the computer generation of integer-valued

time-resolved kinetics of LO-phonon replicas is used to address the energy
relaxation in the excitonic band. From ps time-resolved spectra we bring
evidence for a long lasting non-thermal excitonic distribution which accounts
for the rst 50 ps. Such a behavior is con rmed in di erent experimental
conditions, both when non-resonant and resonant excitation are used. At low
excitation power density the exciton formation and their subsequent
thermalization is dominated by impurity scattering rather than by acoustic

Furthermore, we show that the demands can be met upon extending the SM with a

electronics by using electron spins as information carriers. Its utility relies
on the magnitude of the spin-relaxation, which is dominated by spin- orbit
coupling (SOC). Yet, SOC induced spin-relaxation in metals and semiconductors
is discussed for the seemingly orthogonal cases when inversion symmetry is
retained or broken by the so-called Elliott-Yafet and Dyakonov-Perel
spin-relaxation mechanisms, respectively. We unify the two theories on general
grounds for a generic two-band system containing intra- and inter-band SOC.
While the previously known limiting cases are recovered, we also identify
parameter domains when a crossover occurs between them, i.e. when an inversion
symmetry broken state evolves from a Dyakonov-Perel to an Elliott-Yafet type of
spin-relaxation and conversely for a state with inversional symmetry. This
provides an ultimate link between the two mechanisms of spin-relaxation.

obtained from Rietveld refinement of neutron diffraction data are used to
calculate the interatomic distances and distortions of the oxygen polyhedra
around the Ga1, Ga2, Fe1 and Fe2 cations. Evolution of the distortion of the
oxygen polyhedra around these sites suggests that the Ga1-O tetrahedron is
least distorted and Fe1-O is most distorted. Structural features regarding the

that are slowly and uniformly rotating, are neutrally stratified and may
contain a solid or fluid core. This problem may be regarded as a simplified
model of astrophysical tides in convective regions of stars and giant planets.
The response can be separated into non-wavelike and wavelike parts, where the
former is related instantaneously to the tidal potential and the latter may
involve resonances or other singularities. The imaginary part of the potential
Love number of the body, which is directly related to the rates of energy and
angular momentum exchange in the tidal interaction and to the rate of
dissipation of energy, may have a complicated dependence on the tidal
frequency. However, a certain frequency-average of this quantity is independent
of the dissipative properties of the fluid and can be determined by means of an
impulse calculation. The result is a strongly increasing function of the size
of the core when the tidal potential is a sectoral harmonic, especially when
the body is not strongly centrally condensed. However, the same is not true for
tesseral harmonics, which receive a richer response and may therefore be
important in determining tidal evolution even though they are usually
subdominant in the expansion of the tidal potential. We also discuss
analytically the low-frequency response of a slowly rotating homogeneous fluid
body to tidal potentials proportional to spherical harmonics of degrees less
than five. Tesseral harmonics of degrees greater than two, such as are present
in the case of a spin-orbit misalignment, can resonate with inertial modes of
the full sphere, leading to an enhanced tidal interaction.

behavior of the noise deviates from above quasi- equilibrium modulation noise

nonequilibrium 1/f noise coincides with the range at which the conductance
increases linearly with bias voltage. This feature is attributed to a broad
continuity of states enabling indirect inelastic tunneling across intrinsic

developed in those papers, for the first time we present a procedure for

as for the single crystal and addback modes of operation. We have considered
the experimental data of (i) peak-to-total ratio at 1.3 MeV, and (ii) single
detector efficiency and addback factor for other energies up to 8 MeV. Using
this data, an approximate method of calculating the peak-to-total ratio of
other composite detectors, is shown. Experimental validation of our approach
(for energies up to 8 MeV) has been confirmed considering the data of the SPI
spectrometer. We have discussed about comparisons between various modes of

Bure Interferometer (PdBI). NGC6240 is the prototypical example of a major
galaxy merger in progress, caught at an early stage, with an extended,
strongly-disturbed butterfly-like morphology and the presence of a heavily
obscured active nucleus in the core of each progenitor galaxy. The CO line
shows a skewed profile with very broad and asymmetric wings detected out to
velocities of -600 km/s and +800 km/s with respect to the systemic velocity.
The PdBI maps reveal the existence of two prominent structures of blueshifted
CO emission. One extends eastward, i.e. approximately perpendicular to the line
connecting the galactic nuclei, over scales of ~7 kpc and shows velocities up
to -400 km/s. The other extends southwestward out to ~7 kpc from the nuclear
region, and has a velocity of -100 km/s with respect to the systemic one.
Interestingly, redshifted emission with velocities 400 to 800 km/s is detected
around the two nuclei, extending in the east-west direction, and partly
overlapping with the eastern blue-shifted structure, although tracing a more
compact region of size ~1.7 kpc. The overlap between the southwestern CO blob
and the dust lanes seen in HST images, which are interpreted as tidal tails,
indicates that the molecular gas is deeply affected by galaxy interactions. The
eastern blueshifted CO emission is co-spatial with an Halpha filament that is
associated with strong H2 and soft X-ray emission. The analysis of Chandra
X-ray data provides strong evidence for shocked gas at the position of the
Halpha emission. Its association with outflowing molecular gas supports a
scenario where the molecular gas is compressed into a shock wave that
propagates eastward from the nuclei. If this is an outflow, the AGN are likely
the driving force.

continuum sources have been identified, likely tracing optically thin HII
regions, with physical parameters typical of both extended and compact HII

implicit-solvent, explicit-cosolvent Langevin dynamics computer simulations for
varying interaction strengths. The systematic investigation reveals that
polymer swelling is maximal if both monomer-monomer and monomer-cosolute
interactions are weakly attractive. In the most swollen state the cosolute
density inside the coil is remarkably bulk-like and homogenous. Highly
attractive monomer-cosolute interactions, however, are found to induce a
collapse of the chain which, in contrast to the collapsed case induced by
purely repulsive cosolvents, exhibits a considerably enhanced cosolute density
within the globule. Thus, collapsed states, although appearing similar on a
first glance, may result from very different mechanisms with distinct final
structural and thermodynamics properties. Two theoretical models, one based on
an effective one-component description where the cosolutes have been integrated
out, and a fully two-component Flory -- de Gennes like model, support the
simulation findings above and serve for interpretation. In particular, the
picture is supported that collapse in highly attractive cosolvents is driven by
crosslinking-like bridging effects, while the ratio of attraction width to
cosolute size plays a critical role behind this mechanism. Only if
polymer-cosolute interactions are not too short-ranged swelling effects should
be observable. Our findings may be important for the interpretation of the
effects of cosolutes on polymer and protein conformational structure, in
particular for highly attractive interaction combinations, such as provided by
urea, GdmCl, NaI, or NaClO4 near peptide-like moieties.

SNe. Our goal was to collect publicly available, previously unpublished
measurements on type II-P (or peculiar IIP) SNe from the Spitzer database. The
temporal changes of the observed fluxes may be indicative of the underlying
supernova, while spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to the fluxes in
different IRAC channels may reveal the physical parameters of the mid-IR
radiation, presumably due to warm dust. IRS spectra were extracted and
calibrated with SPICE, while photometric SEDs were assembled using IRAF and
MOPEX. Calculated SEDs from observed fluxes were fit with simple dust models to
get basic information on the dust presumed as the source of MIR radiation. We
found twelve SNe satisfying the criterion above, observed at late-time epochs
(typically after +300 days). In three cases we could not identify any point
source at the SN position on late time IRAC images. We found two SNe, 2005ad

the other seven cases the observed MIR flux may originate from pre-existing
circumstellar or interstellar dust. Our results support the previous
observational conclusions that warm new dust in the environment of SNe
contributes only marginally to cosmic dust content.

flexible, and mathematically tractable asset pricing framework in finite time.
The pricing kernel, giving rise to the price system in an incomplete market, is
modelled by weighted heat kernels which are driven by multivariate Markov
processes and which provide enough degrees of freedom in order to calibrate to
relevant data, e.g. to the term structure of bond prices. It is shown how, for
a class of models, the prices of bonds, caplets, and swaptions can be computed
in closed form. The dynamical equations for the price processes are derived,
and explicit formulae are obtained for the short rate of interest, the risk
premium, and for the stochastic volatility of prices. Several of the
closed-form asset price models presented in this paper are driven by
combinations of Markovian jump processes with different probability laws. Such
models provide a rich basis for consistent applications in several sectors of a
financial market including equity, fixed-income, commodities, and insurance.
The flexible, multidimensional and multivariate structure, on which the asset
price models are constructed, lends itself well to the transparent modelling of
dependence across asset classes. As an illustration, the impact on prices by
spiralling debt, a typical feature of a financial crisis, is modelled
explicitly, and contagion effects are readily observed in the dynamics of asset
returns.

magnetic stars to be harder and more luminous than their non-magnetic

  $\tau$ Sco is one example where the expectations are better met. This bright
main sequence, early B star has been studied extensively in a variety of

general input sets. Specifically, we assume the data consists of noisy
quadratic measurements of an unknown input x in R^n that lies in a general set
T and study conditions under which x can be stably recovered from the
measurements. In the noise-free setting we derive a general expression on the
number of measurements needed to ensure that a unique solution can be found in
a stable way, that depends on the set T through a natural complexity parameter.
This parameter can be computed explicitly for many sets T of interest. For
example, for k-sparse inputs we show that O(k\log(n/k)) measurements are
needed, and when x can be any vector in R^n, O(n) measurements suffice. In the
noisy case, we show that if one can find a value for which the empirical risk
is bounded by a given, computable constant (that depends on the set T), then
the error with respect to the true input is bounded above by an another,
closely related complexity parameter of the set. By choosing an appropriate
number N of measurements, this bound can be made arbitrarily small, and it
decays at a rate faster than N^{-1/2+\delta} for any \delta>0. In particular,
for k-sparse vectors stable recovery is possible from O(k\log(n/k)\log k) noisy
measurements, and when x can be any vector in R^n, O(n \log n) noisy
measurements suffice. We also show that the complexity parameter for the
quadratic problem is the same as the one used for analyzing stability in linear

be paid in terms of stability if there is no knowledge of the phase.

However the Higgs signal rate in the WW and ZZ channels can remain close to the
SM values, as observed at the LHC, even if the SM-like Higgs boson with a mass
near 125 GeV has a large singlet component. This allows to get a sizable
enhancement in the Higgs to diphoton rate through the charged-higgsino loop
contribution, as well as a sizable reduction of the Higgs to bb and tautau
rates through the mixing effects, with little deviation in the WW and ZZ signal
rates from the SM prediction. We find that an enhancement of diphoton signals
by a factor of 1.5 or more, and also a reduction of bb and tautau signals by a
factor of 0.5, can be obtained in the region of parameter space consistent with

such covariates, the covariate value is unobserved if the corresponding

evaluated. For continuous-valued covariates, the corresponding likelihood can
only be expressed in the form of an integral that is analytically intractable
and, to date, no maximum likelihood approach that uses all the information in
the data has been developed. Assuming a first-order Markov process for the
covariate values, we accomplish this task by formulating the MRR setting in a
state-space framework and considering an approximate likelihood approach which
essentially discretizes the range of covariate values, reducing the integral to
a summation. The likelihood can then be efficiently calculated and maximized
using standard techniques for hidden Markov models. We initially assess the
approach using simulated data before applying to real data relating to Soay
sheep, specifying the survival probability as a function of body mass. Models
that have previously been suggested for the corresponding covariate process are
typically of the form of diffusive random walks. We consider an alternative

zero longitudinal momentum ($k_{x}=0$) modes turn out to be Majorana fermion

continuous isotropic-nematic (IN) transition. The process has been monitored by
following the behavior of the adsorption isotherms for different values of
lateral interaction energy/temperature. The numerical data were compared with
mean-field analytical predictions and exact functions for noninteracting and 1D
systems. The obtained results revealed the existence of three adsorption
regimes in temperature. (1) At high temperatures, above the critical one
characterizing the IN transition at full coverage Tc(\theta=1), the particles
are distributed at random on the surface and the adlayer behaves as a
noninteracting 2D system. (2) At very low temperatures, the asymmetric monomers
adsorb forming chains over almost the entire range of coverage, and the
adsorption process behaves as a 1D problem. (3) In the intermediate regime, the
system exhibits a mixed regime and the filling of the lattice proceeds
according to two different processes. In the first stage, the monomers adsorb
isotropically on the lattice until the IN transition occurs in the system and,
from this point, particles adsorb forming chains so that the adlayer behaves as
a 1D fluid. The two adsorption processes are present in the adsorption
isotherms, and a marked singularity can be observed that separates both
regimes. Thus, the adsorption isotherms appear as sensitive quantities with
respect to the IN phase transition, allowing us (i) to reproduce the phase
diagram of the system for square lattices and (ii) to obtain an accurate
determination of the phase diagram for triangular lattices.

red and have intermediate-to-old stellar populations, with a median
luminosity-weighted age of 5.4 Gyr and a median mass-weighted age of 9.2 Gyr.
Their velocity dispersions and dynamical masses are consistent with the small
radii and high stellar mass estimates. Comparing with the WINGS sample of
cluster galaxies at similar redshifts, the fraction of superdense galaxies is
three times smaller in the field than in clusters, and cluster SDGs are on
average 4 Gyr older than field SDGs. We confirm the existence of a universal
trend of smaller radii for older luminosity-weighted ages at fixed galaxy mass.
On top of the well known dependence of stellar age on galaxy mass, the
luminosity-weighted age of galaxies depends on galaxy compactness at fixed
mass, and, for a fixed mass and radius, on environment. This effect needs to be
taken into account in order not to overestimate the evolution of galaxy sizes
from high- to low-z. Our results and hierarchical simulations suggest that a
significant fraction of the massive compact galaxies at high-z have evolved
into compact galaxies in galaxy clusters today. When stellar age and
environmental effects are taken into account, the average amount of size
