of stellar matter at subnuclear densities and temperatures (0.5-10 MeV)
expected to occur during the collapse of massive stars and supernova
explosions. The models introduce the distributions of various nuclear species
in nuclear statistical equilibrium, but use somewhat different nuclear physics
inputs. It is demonstrated that the basic thermodynamical quantities of stellar
matter under these conditions are similar, except in the region of high
densities and low temperatures. We demonstrate that mass and isotopic
distributions have considerable differences related to the different
assumptions of the models on properties of nuclei at these stellar conditions.
Overall, the three models give similar trends, but the details reflect the
uncertainties related to the modeling of medium effects, such as the
temperature and density dependence of surface and bulk energies of heavy
nuclei, and the nuclear shell structure effects. We discuss importance of new
physics inputs for astrophysical calculations from experimental data obtained
in intermediate energy heavy-ion collisions, in particular, the similarities of
the conditions reached during supernova explosions and multifragmentation
reactions.

hospital acquired candidiasis with worldwide impact on public health. Because
of its importance as a nosocomial etiologic agent, C. albicans genome has been
largely studied to identify intraspecific variation and several typing methods
have been developed to distinguish closely related strains. Mitochondrial DNA
can be useful for this purpose because, as compared to nuclear DNA, its higher
mutational load and evolutionary rate readily reveals microvariants.
Accordingly, we sequenced and assembled, with 8 fold coverage, the
mitochondrial genomes of two C. albicans clinical isolates (L296 and L757) and
compared these sequences with the genome sequence of reference strain SC5314.
The genome alignment of 33,928 positions revealed 372 polymorphic sites being
230 in coding and 142 in non-coding regions. Three intergenic regions located
between genes tRNAGly/COX1, NAD3/COB and ssurRNA/NAD4L, named IG1, IG2 and IG3
respectively, which showed high number of neutral substitutions, were amplified
and sequenced from 18 clinical isolates from different locations in Latin
America and 2 ATCC standard C. albicans strains. High variability of sequence
and size were observed, ranging up to 56bp size difference and phylogenies
based on IG1, IG2 and IG3 revealed three groups. Insertions of up to 49bp were
observed exclusively in Argentinean strains relative to the other sequences
which could suggest clustering by geographical polymorphism. Because of neutral
evolution, high variability, easy isolation by PCR and full length sequencing
these mitochondrial intergenic regions can contribute with a novel perspective
in molecular studies of C. albicans isolates, complementing well established
multilocus sequence typing methods.

inside the stars as well as about variations in magnetic field structure and
intensity. The task of inferring and disentangling that information is,
however, not a trivial one. In the sun and solar-like pulsators, the direct
effect of the magnetic field on the oscillations might be significantly
important in regions of strong magnetic field (such as solar- / stellar-spots),
where the Lorentz force can be comparable to the gas-pressure gradient. Our aim
is to determine the sun- / stellar-spots effect on the oscillation frequencies
and attempt to understand if this effect contributes strongly to the frequency
changes observed along the magnetic cycle. The total contribution of the spots
to the frequency shifts results from a combination of direct and indirect
effects of the magnetic field on the oscillations. In this first work we
considered only the indirect effect associated with changes in the
stratification within the starspot. Based on the solution of the wave equation
and the variational principle we estimated the impact of these stratification
changes on the oscillation frequencies of global modes in the sun and found
that the induced frequency shifts are about two orders of magnitude smaller
than the frequency shifts observed over the solar cycle.

density fluctuations on flare-accelerated electron transport in the solar
corona. Using the quasi-linear approximation, we numerically simulated the
propagation of a beam of accelerated electrons from the solar corona to the
chromosphere, including the self-consistent response of the inhomogeneous
background plasma in the form of Langmuir waves. We calculated the X-ray
spectrum from these simulations using the bremsstrahlung cross-section and
fitted the footpoint spectrum using the collisional ""thick-target"" model, a
standard approach adopted in observational studies. We find that the
interaction of the Langmuir waves with the background electron density gradient
shifts the waves to a higher phase velocity where they then resonate with
higher velocity electrons. The consequence is that some of the electrons are
shifted to higher energies, producing more high-energy X-rays than expected if
the density inhomogeneity is not considered. We find that the level of energy
gain is strongly dependent on the initial electron beam density at higher
energy and the magnitude of the density gradient in the background plasma. The
most significant gains are for steep (soft) spectra that initially had few
electrons at higher energies. If the X-ray spectrum of the simulated footpoint
emission are fitted with the standard ""thick-target"" model (as is routinely
done with RHESSI observations) some simulation scenarios produce more than an
order-of-magnitude overestimate of the number of electrons $>50$keV in the
source coronal distribution.

utilize reconfigurable or pattern-dynamic antennas. The focus is on
finite-state channels with memory and performance is assessed in terms of
real-time behavior. In a wireless setting, when a slow fading channel enters a
deep fade, the corresponding communication system faces the threat of
successive decoding failures at the destination. Under such circumstances,
rapidly getting out of deep fades becomes a priority. Recent advances in fast
reconfigurable antennas provide new means to alter the statistical profile of
fading channels and thereby reduce the probability of prolonged fades. Fast
reconfigurable antennas are therefore poised to improve overall performance,
especially for delay-sensitive traffic in slow-fading environments. This
potential for enhanced performance motivates this study of the temporal
behavior of point-to-point communication systems with reconfigurable antennas.
Specifically, agile wireless communication schemes over erasure channels are
analyzed; situations where using reconfigurable antennas yield substantial
performance gains in terms of throughput and average delay are identified.
Scenarios where only partial state information is available at the receiver are
also examined, naturally leading to partially observable decision processes.

An agreement between experimental and theoretical spectra was achieved for a
10.7 nm thick film, while a distinction in the Kerr effect amplitudes was
obtained for a 5 nm thick film. This points to the slight suppression of
ferromagnetism by interface effects. Nevertheless, the room temperature
ferromagnetism of the 5 nm thick film was clearly demonstrated. All the studied

the least maximal length of any sweepout of the 2-sphere apparent horizon by

metallicity close to solar ([Fe/H]= 0.0 +- 0.1). The companion star, WASP-77B,
is a K-dwarf approximately 2 magnitudes fainter at a separation of
approximately 3arcsec. The spectrum of WASP-77A shows emission in the cores of
the Ca II H and K lines indicative of moderate chromospheric activity. The WASP
lightcurves show photometric variability with a period of 15.3 days and an
amplitude of about 0.3% that is probably due to the magnetic activity of the
host star. We use an analysis of the combined photometric and spectroscopic
data to derive the mass and radius of the planet (1.76+-0.06MJup,
1.21+-0.02RJup). The age of WASP-77A estimated from its rotation rate (~1 Gyr)

in poor agreement with the age inferred by comparing its effective temperature
and density to stellar models (~8 Gyr). Follow-up observations of WASP-77 Ab

evolution. Standard for continuous spectrum thermal bath CL dynamics
dissipative dynamics (exponential decay) takes place only within the initial

material Tb2Sn2O7 through ac magnetic susceptibility measurements of both the
pure material and samples with small percentages of Ti substituted on the Sn
sublattice. We observe a clear signature for the previously reported ordering
transition at TC = 850 mK, as well as evidence for dynamic freezing at
temperatures well below TC, confirming the persistence of significant magnetic
fluctuations deep in the spin-ordered regime. The long range ordering
transition was completely suppressed with as little as 5% Ti for Sn
substitution, and 10% Ti substitution resulted in a spin-glass-like spin
freezing transition near 250 mK. The results demonstrate that the long range
magnetic ordering is surprisingly fragile in this system.

Kohn-Nirenberg symbols from their response to a single discretely supported
identifier signal. The available results are inherently non-local. For example,
we show that in order to recover a bandlimited operator precisely, the
identifier cannot decay in time nor in frequency. Moreover, a concept of local
and discrete representation is missing from the theory. In this paper, we
develop tools that address these shortcomings.
  We show that to obtain a local approximation of an operator, it is sufficient
to test the operator on a truncated and mollified delta train, that is, on a
compactly supported Schwarz class function. To compute the operator
numerically, discrete measurements can be obtained from the response function
which are localized in the sense that a local selection of the values yields a
local approximation of the operator.
  Central to our analysis is to conceptualize the meaning of localization for
operators with bandlimited Kohn-Nirenberg symbol.

applications to the van-der-Waals-bound ethylene-propylene dimer and to the
hexaaquairon(II) transition-metal cation. Calculation of the dissociation curve
for the ethylene-propylene dimer reveals that WFT-in-DFT embedding reproduces
full CCSD(T) energies to within 0.1 kcal/mol at all distances, eliminating
errors in the dispersion interactions due to conventional exchange-correlation

partitioning across covalent bonds. Application of WFT-in-DFT embedding to the

simulations in implicit solvent to investigate the significance of either
mutations or post-translational modifications (PTMs) to SOD1 on metal affinity,
dimer stability, and mechanical malleability. The work required to induce
moderate structural deformations as a function of sequence index constitutes a
""mechanical fingerprint"" measuring structural rigidity in the native basin,
from which we are able to unambiguously distinguish wild-type (WT) SOD1 from
PTM variants, and measure the severity of a given PTM on structural integrity.
The cumulative distribution of work values provided a way to cleanly
discriminate between SOD1 variants. Disulfide reduction destabilizes dimer
stability more than the removal of either metal, but not moreso than the
removal of both metals. Intriguingly, we found that disulfide reduction
mechanically stabilizes apo SOD1 monomer, underscoring the differences between
native basin mechanical properties and equilibrium thermodynamic stabilities,
and elucidating the presence of internal stress in the apo state. All PTMs and
ALS-associated mutants studied showed an increased tendency to lose either Cu
or Zn, and to monomerize- processes known to be critical in the progression of
ALS. The valence of Cu strongly modulates its binding free energy. As well,
several mutants were more susceptible to loss of metals and monomerization than
the disulfide-reduced or apo forms of SOD1. Distance constraints are required

fluctuations of electromagnetic field in three cases, de Sitter spacetime, de
Sitter spacetime with weak gravitational field and Schwarzschild-de Sitter
spacetime. In de Sitter spacetime the resulting net force follows the square
inverse law but unfortunately it is too weak to be measurable due to the large
universe radius. By introducing a weak gravitational field into the de Sitter
spacetime, we find the net force now can be splited into two parts, one is the
gravitational force due to the induced effective mass between the two plates,
the other one is generated by the metric structure of de Sitter spacetime. In
order to investigate the vacuum fluctuation force on the rigid cavity under
strong gravitational field, we perform the similar analysis in Schwarzschild-de
Sitter spacetime, results are obtained in three different limits. The most
interesting one is when the cavity gets closer to the horizon of a blackhole,
square inverse law is recovered and the repulsive force due to negative
energy/mass of the cavity now has an observable strength. More important the
force changes from being repulsive to attractive when the cavity crosses the
event horizon, so that the energy/mass of the cavity switches the sign which
suggests the unusual time direction inside the event horizon. %A possible way
in verifying whether our universe is in a de Sitter or Minkowski spacetime is

some of the most interesting groups of pulsars that have been intensively
studied in the recent years. They are understood as neutron stars (NSs) with
super strong magnetic fields, namely $B\gtrsim10^{14}$ G. However, in the last
two years two SGRs with low magnetic fields $B\sim(10^{12}-10^{13})$ G have
been detected. Moreover, three fast and very {\it magnetic} white dwarfs (WDs)
have also been observed in the last years. Based on these new pulsar
discoveries, we compare and contrast the magnetic fields, magnetic dipole
moment, characteristic ages, and X-ray steady luminosities of these two SGRs
(in the WD model) with three fast white dwarfs, to conclude that they show
strong similarities corroborating an alternative description of several
SGRs/AXPs as very massive and magnetic white dwarfs. The pulsar magnetic dipole
moment $m$ depending only on the momentum of inertia $I$, and observational
properties, such as the period $P$ and its first time derivative $\dot{P}$, can
help to identify the scale of $I$ for SGRs/AXPs. We analyze the pulsar magnetic
dipole moment $m$ of SGRs and AXPs when a model based on a massive fast
rotating highly magnetized white dwarf is considered. We show that the values
for $m$ obtained for several SGRs and AXPs are in agreement with the observed
range $10^{34}{\rm emu}\leq m \leq10^{36}{\rm emu}$ of isolated and polar
magnetic white dwarfs. This result together with the fact that for {\it
magnetic} white dwarfs $B\sim(10^6-10^8)$ G their magnetic dipole moments are
almost independent of the star rotation period ($10^{4}\lesssim P
\lesssim10^{6} {\rm s}$) - a phenomenology not shared by neutron stars pulsars
- suggests a possible {\it magnetic} white dwarf nature for some of SGRs/AXPs

increase the number of symbiotic stars known to be X-ray sources by
approximately 30%. The Swift/XRT telescope detected all of the new X-ray
sources at energies greater than 2 keV. Their X-ray spectra are consistent with
thermal emission and fall naturally into three distinct groups. The first group
contains those sources with a single, highly absorbed hard component that we
identify as probably coming from an accretion-disk boundary layer. The second
group is composed of those sources with a single, soft X-ray spectral component
that probably originates in a region where low-velocity shocks produce X-ray
emission, i.e., a colliding-wind region.
  The third group consists of those sources with both hard and soft X-ray
spectral components. We also find that unlike in the optical, where rapid,
stochastic brightness variations from the accretion disk typically are not
seen, detectable UV flickering is a common property of symbiotic stars.

of our bounds follows by exploiting known tight bounds for the number of faces
of $r$ $d$-polytopes, where $r\ge d$. For $d\ge 4$, the maximum values are
attained when $P_1$, $P_2$ and $P_3$ are $d$-polytopes, whose vertex sets are
chosen appropriately from three distinct $d$-dimensional moment-like curves.

nearly 3,000 high-resolution spectra of 93 late-type (K5-M5) stars over more
than a decade using HET/HRS. This sample provides a unique opportunity to
investigate the occurrence of long-term stellar activity cycles for low-mass
stars. In this paper, we examine the stellar activity of our targets as
reflected in the H-alpha feature. We have identified periodic signals for 6
stars, with periods ranging from days to more than 10 years, and find long-term
trends for 7 others. Stellar cycles with P > 1 year are present for at least 5%
of our targets. Additionally, we present an analysis of the time-averaged
activity levels of our sample, and search for correlations with other stellar
properties. In particular, we find that more massive, earlier type (M0-M2)
stars tend to be more active than later type dwarfs. Furthermore,
high-metallicity stars tend to be more active at a given stellar mass. We also
evaluate H-alpha variability as a tracer of activity-induced radial velocity
(RV) variation. For the M dwarf GJ 1170, H-alpha variation reveals stellar
activity patterns matching those seen in the RVs, mimicking the signal of a
giant planet, and we find evidence that the previously identified stellar
activity cycle of GJ 581 may be responsible for the recently retracted planet f
(Vogt et al. 2012) in that system. In general, though, we find that H-alpha is
not frequently correlated with RV at the precision (typically 6-7 m/s) of our
measurements.

The latter plays a central role in many truncation schemes for functional
equations. By including it dynamically we can determine its influence on the
propagators. We also suggest a new model for the three-gluon vertex motivated
by lattice data which plays a crucial role to obtain stable solutions when the
ghost-gluon vertex is included. We find that both vertices have a sizable

we establish that the three-gluon vertex dressing turns negative at low momenta

fix the time dependence by imposing energy-momentum conservation. Mass
renormalization induces logarithmic ultraviolet divergences at quadratic order

parallax analysis yields the mean absolute magnitudes, mean velocities and
velocity ellipsoids for homogenous samples of stars. We selected homogeneous
groups of subdwarfs based on their photometric colors and spectral appearance.
We examined the color-magnitude relations of low-mass subdwarfs and quantified
their dependence on the newly-refined metallicity parameter, zeta. We also
developed a photometric metallicity parameter, delta(g-r), based on the g-r and
r-z colors of low-mass stars and used it to select stars with similar
metallicities. The kinematics of low-mass subdwarfs as a function of color and
metallicity were also examined and compared to main sequence M dwarfs. We find
that the SDSS subdwarfs share similar kinematics to the inner halo and thick
disk. The color-magnitude relations derived in this analysis will be a powerful
tool for identifying and characterizing low-mass metal-poor subdwarfs in future
surveys such as GAIA and LSST, making them important and plentiful tracers of

present day power-law stellar mass function (MF) of a resolved young star
cluster. This technique (a) fully exploits the information content of a given
dataset; (b) accounts for observational uncertainties in a straightforward way;
(c) assigns meaningful uncertainties to the inferred parameters; (d) avoids the
pitfalls associated with binning data; and (e) is applicable to virtually any
resolved young cluster, laying the groundwork for a systematic study of the
high mass stellar MF (M > 1 Msun). Using simulated clusters and Markov chain
Monte Carlo sampling of the probability distribution functions, we show that
estimates of the MF slope, {\alpha}, are unbiased and that the uncertainty,
{\Delta}{\alpha}, depends primarily on the number of observed stars and stellar
mass range they span, assuming that the uncertainties on individual masses and
the completeness are well-characterized. Using idealized mock data, we compute
the lower limit precision on {\alpha} and provide an analytic approximation for
{\Delta}{\alpha} as a function of the observed number of stars and mass range.
We find that ~ 3/4 of quoted literature uncertainties are smaller than the
theoretical lower limit. By correcting these uncertainties to the theoretical
lower limits, we find the literature studies yield <{\alpha}>=2.46 with a
1-{\sigma} dispersion of 0.35 dex. We verify that it is impossible for a
power-law MF to obtain meaningful constraints on the upper mass limit of the
IMF. We show that avoiding substantial biases in the MF slope requires: (1)
including the MF as a prior when deriving individual stellar mass estimates;
(2) modeling the uncertainties in the individual stellar masses; and (3) fully
characterizing and then explicitly modeling the completeness for stars of a
given mass. (abridged)

present a special challenge for collider searches. For stop pairs directly
produced from QCD, the visible final-state particles are identical to those of
top quark pair production, giving very similar kinematics but often with much
smaller rates. The situation is exacerbated for compressed spectra with m(stop)
~ m(top) + m(LSP), as well as for lighter stops which can suffer from low
acceptance efficiencies. In this note, we explore the power of a direct stop
search using dileptonic mT2, similar to the one recently performed by ATLAS,
but more optimized to cover these difficult regions of the (m(stop),m(LSP))
plane. Our study accounts for the effects of stop chirality and LSP identity,
which can be significant. In particular, our estimates suggest that m(stop) ~
m(top) with a massless LSP is excludable for right-handed stops with bino-like
(gravitino) LSP with 2012 (2011) data, but remains largely unobservable in the
case of a higgsino-like singlino LSP. For each of these cases we map out the
regions of parameter space that can be excluded with 2012 data, as well as
currently allowed regions that would yield discovery-level significance. We
also comment on the prospects of a precision mT2 shape measurement, and
consider the potential of ATLAS's dileptonic stop -> b chi^+ searches when
re-interpreted for light stops decaying directly to the LSP.

a persistent source of density, radiative flux, and magnetic field fluctuations
in stably-stratified, optically-thick media. The conditions for instability are
present in a variety of astrophysical environments, and do not require the
radiation pressure to dominate or the magnetic field to be strong. Here we
numerically study the saturation properties of the RMI, covering three orders
of magnitude in the relative strength of radiation, magnetic field, and gas
energies. Two-dimensional, time-dependent radiation-MHD simulations of local,
stably-stratified domains are conducted with Zeus-MP in the optically-thick,
highly-conducting limit. Our results confirm the theoretical expectations of
Blaes and Socrates (2003) in that the RMI operates even in gas
pressure-dominated environments that are weakly magnetized. The saturation
amplitude is a monotonically increasing function of the ratio of radiation to
gas pressure. Keeping this ratio constant, we find that the saturation
amplitude peaks when the magnetic pressure is comparable to the radiation
pressure. We discuss the implications of our results for the dynamics of
magnetized stellar envelopes, where the RMI should act as a source of
sub-photospheric perturbations.

be employed to construct a hierarchical probabilistic model which allows
pre-main sequence ages, masses, accretion rates, and extinctions to be
estimated using two widely available photometric survey databases (IPHAS
r/i/Halpha and 2MASS J-band magnitudes.) Because our approach does not rely on
spectroscopy, it can easily be applied to homogeneously study the large number
of clusters for which Gaia will yield membership lists. We explain how the
analysis is carried out using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and
provide Python source code. We then demonstrate its use on 587 known low-mass
members of the star-forming region NGC 2264 (Cone Nebula), arriving at a median
age of 3.0 Myr, an accretion fraction of 20+/-2% and a median accretion rate of
10^-8.4 Msol/yr. The Bayesian analysis formulated in this work delivers results
which are in agreement with spectroscopic studies already in the literature,
but achieves this with great efficiency by depending only on photometry. It is
a significant step forward from previous photometric studies, because the
probabilistic approach ensures that nuisance parameters, such as extinction and
distance, are fully included in the analysis with a clear picture on any

significantly from the earlier seminal results that imply a simple power-law
decay of the bolometric light curve as $t^{-5/3}$. We now know that the details
of the rise to the peak of the lightcurve is determined mainly by the internal
structure of the disrupted star. We also have improved models for the disc
thermal emission, showing that in this case the decline of the luminosity with
time should be much flatter than the standard $t^{-5/3}$ law, especially in
optical and UV wavelengths, while the X-ray lightcurve is generally best suited
to track the bolometric one. Finally, we are just starting to explore the
interesting general relativistic effects that might arise for such events, for
which the tidal radius lies very close to the black hole event horizon. In
particular, I describe here some possible evidences for relativistic
Lense-Thirring precession from the light curve of the event Swift J1644.

this configuration the parameter landscape of Deformable Mirror Surfaces that
yield high contrast Point Spread Functions is not linear, and non-linear
methods are needed to find the true minimum in the optimization topology. We
solve the highly non-linear Monge-Ampere equation that is the fundamental
equation describing the physics of phase induced amplitude modulation. We
determine the optimum configuration for our two sequential Deformable Mirror
system and show that high-throughput and high contrast solutions can be
achieved using realistic surface deformations that are accessible using

Discontinuities (ACAD). We show that for geometries similar to JWST, ACAD can
attain at least 10^-7 in contrast and an order of magnitude higher for both the
future Extremely Large Telescopes and on-axis architectures reminiscent of HST.
We show that the converging non-linear mappings resulting from our Deformable
Mirror shapes actually damp near-field diffraction artifacts in the vicinity of
the discontinuities. Consequently, ACAD is a true broadband solution to the
problem of high-contrast imaging with segmented and/or on-axis apertures. We
finally show that once the non-linear solution is found, fine tuning with

a model of surface thermal emission from the hot polar caps of the neutron

AGN in quenched galaxies, suggesting that: i) AGN feedback is not associated

However, we also find that classical bulges with low gas surface density can be
barred as well. Our results suggest that understanding the connection between
the central surface density of gas in disk galaxies and the presence of bars

efficient encoding of a matrix description of a state into a description of a
circuit to generate the state, we can show that our promise problem is NP-hard
with respect to Cook reductions. Thus, the quantum separability problem (as
phrased above) constitutes the first nontrivial promise problem decidable by a
two-message quantum interactive proof system while being hard for both NP and
QSZK. We also consider a variant of the problem, in which a given
polynomial-time mixed-state quantum circuit accepts a quantum state as input,
and the question is to decide if there is an input to this circuit which makes
its output separable across some bipartite cut. We prove that this problem is a
complete promise problem for the class QIP of problems decidable by quantum
interactive proof systems. Finally, we show that a two-message quantum
interactive proof system can also decide a multipartite generalization of the
quantum separability problem.

the SDSS main sample which arise from fitting different 1- and 2-component
model profiles to the images. In objects brighter than L*, fitting a single
Sersic profile to what is really a two-component SerExp system leads to biases:
the half-light radius is increasingly overestimated as n of the fitted single
component increases; it is also overestimated at B/T ~ 0.6. However, the net
effect on the R-L relation is small, except for the most luminous tail, where
it curves upwards towards larger sizes. We also study how this relation depends
on morphological type. Our analysis is one of the first to use
Bayesian-classifier derived weights, rather than hard cuts, to define
morphology. Crudely, there appear to be only two relations: one for early-types
(Es, S0s and Sa's) and another for late-types (Sbs and Scds). However, closer
inspection shows that within the early-type sample S0s tend to be 15% smaller
than Es of the same luminosity, and, among faint late types, Sbs are more than
25% smaller than Scds. Neither the early- nor the late-type relations are pure
power-laws: both show significant curvature, which we quantify. However, the
R-L relations of the bulges of early-types are almost pure power laws. Our
analysis confirms that two mass scales are special for early-type galaxies: M*
= 3e10 and 2e11 Msun. These same mass scales are also special for late types:
there is almost no correlation between R and M* below the former, and almost no
late-types above the latter. We also show that the intrinsic scatter around the
relation decreases at large luminosity and/or stellar mass; this should provide
additional constraints on models of how the most massive galaxies formed.

$\sigma_{\mathrm{radius}} \approx 5\%$. The global values (half-light radius
and magnitude) are equally well constrained when a two-component model is used.
Sub-components of two-component models present more scatter. SDSS resolution is
the primary source of error in the recovery of models. We use a simple
statistical correction of the biases in fitted parameters, providing an example
using the S{\'e}rsic index. Fitting a two-component S{\'e}rsic + Exponential
model to a single S{\'e}rsic galaxy results in a noisier, but unbiased,
recovery of the input parameters ($\sigma_{\mathrm{total mag}} \approx 0.075$

of reconstructing the wave speed inside a domain from boundary measurements

$\tilde M$ with a varying and possibly anisotropic wave speed which we model as
a Riemannian metric $g$. For our data, we assume that $\tilde M$ contains a
dense set of point scatterers and that in a subset $U\subset \tilde M$,
modeling a region containing measurement devices, we can measure the wave
fronts of the single scattered waves diffracted from the point scatterers. The
inverse problem we study is to recover the metric $g$ in local coordinates
anywhere on a set $M \subset \tilde M$ up to an isometry (i.e. we recover the
isometry type of $M$). To do this we show that the shape operators related to
wave fronts produced by the point scatterers within $\tilde M$ satisfy a
certain system of differential equations which may be solved along geodesics of
the metric. In this way, assuming we know $g$ as well as the shape operator of
the wave fronts in the region $U$, we may recover $g$ in certain coordinate
systems (e.g. Riemannian normal coordinates centered at point scatterers). This
generalizes the well-known geophysical method of Dix to metrics which may
depend on all spatial variables and be anisotropic. In particular, the novelty
of this solution lies in the fact that it can be used to reconstruct the metric
also in the presence of the caustics.

a system of coupled Fisher-KPP equations. When a single parameter is set to
zero, the system consists of two uncoupled Fisher-KPP equations which give rise
to traveling fronts propagating with the unique, minimal KPP speed. When the
coupling parameter is nonzero various behaviors can be observed. Anomalous
spreading occurs when one component of the system spreads at a speed
significantly faster in the coupled system than it does in isolation, while the
speed of the second component remains unchanged. We study these anomalous
spreading speeds and show that they arise due to poles of the pointwise Green's
function corresponding to the linearizion about the unstable homogeneous state.
These poles lead to anomalous spreading in the linearized system and come in
two varieties -- one that persists and leads to anomalous spreading for the
nonlinear system and one that does not. We describe the mechanisms leading to
these two behaviors and prove that one class of poles are irrelevant as far as
nonlinear wavespeed selection is concerned. Finally, we show that the same
mechanism can give rise to anomalous spreading even when the slower component
does not spread.

this covering factor is twice that of the contemporaneous Lyman Break Galaxy

temperature T_eff = 5903+/-42 K, surface gravity log (g) = 4.07+/-0.16 (cgs),
and metallicity [Fe/H] = -0.23+/-0.07. This candidate was discovered using data
from the first two years of the Multi-object APO Radial Velocity Exoplanets
Large-area Survey (MARVELS), which is part of the third phase of Sloan Digital
Sky Survey. From our 38 radial velocity measurements spread over a two-year
time baseline, we derive a Keplerian orbital fit with semi-amplitude
K=3.571+/-0.041 km/s, period P=9.0090+/-0.0004 days, and eccentricity
e=0.226+/-0.011. Adopting a mass of 1.16+/-0.11 Msun for the subgiant host
star, we infer that the companion has a minimum mass of 40.0+/-2.5 M_Jup.
Assuming an edge-on orbit, the semimajor axis is 0.090+/-0.003 AU. The host
star is photometrically variable at the \sim1% level with a period of
\sim13.16+/-0.01 days, indicating that the host star spin and companion orbit
are not synchronized. Through adaptive optics imaging we also found a point
source 643+/-10 mas away from TYC 2087-00255-1, which would have a mass of 0.13
Msun if it is physically associated with TYC 2087-00255-1 and has the same age.
Future proper motion observation should be able to resolve if this tertiary
object is physically associated with TYC 2087-00255-1 and make TYC 2087-00255-1
a triple body system. Core Ca II H and K line emission indicate that the host
is chromospherically active, at a level that is consistent with the inferred
spin period and measured v_{rot}*sin i, but unusual for a subgiant of this
T_eff. This activity could be explained by ongoing tidal spin-up of the host
star by the companion.

Symbiotic novae are those systems in which thermonuclear eruptions occur on the
WD components. These are to be distinguished from events driven by accretion
disk instabilities analogous to dwarf novae eruptions in cataclysmic variable
outbursts. Another class of symbiotic systems are those in which the WD is
extremely luminous and it seems likely that quiescent nuclear burning is
ongoing on the accreting WD. A fundamental question is the secular evolution of
the WD. Do the repeated outbursts or quiescent burning in these accreting
systems cause the WD to gain or lose mass? If it is gaining mass, can it
eventually reach the Chandrasekhar Limit and become a supernova (a SN Ia if it
can hide the hydrogen and helium in the system)? In order to better understand
these systems, we have begun a new study of the evolution of Thermonuclear
Runaways (TNRs) in the accreted envelopes of WDs using a variety of initial WD
masses, luminosities and mass accretion rates. We use our 1-D hydro code, NOVA,
which includes the new convective algorithm of Arnett, Meakin and Young, the
Hix and Thielemann nuclear reaction solver, the Iliadis reaction rate library,
the Timmes equation of state, and the OPAL opacities. We assume a solar
composition (Lodders abundance distribution) and do not allow any mixing of
accreted material with core material. This assumption strongly influences our
results. We report here (1) that the WD grows in mass for all simulations so
that canonical `steady burning' does not occur, and (2) that only a small
fraction of the accreted matter is ejected in some (but not all) simulations.
We also find that the accreting systems, before thermonuclear runaway, are too
cool to be seen in X-ray searches for SN Ia progenitors.

accounting for charge exchange and ionization of neutral hydrogen, which
profoundly change the structure of the shock, as discussed in our previous
work. This important dynamical effect of neutrals is mainly associated to the
so-called neutral return flux, namely the return of hot neutrals from the
downstream region to the upstream, where they deposit energy and momentum
through charge exchange and ionization. We also present the self-consistent
calculation of Balmer line emission from the shock region and discuss how to
use measurements of the anomalous width of the different components of the
Balmer line to infer the cosmic ray acceleration efficiency in supernova
remnants showing Balmer emission: the broad Balmer line, which is due to charge
exchange of hydrogen atoms with hot ions downstream of the shock, is shown to
become narrower as a result of the energy drainage into cosmic rays, while the
narrow Balmer line, due to charge exchange in the cosmic-ray--induced
precursor, is shown to become broader. In addition to these two well-known
components, the neutral return flux leads to the formation of a third component
with intermediate width: this too contains information on ongoing processes at
the shock.

the disk meets the surface of the accreting star, usually relies on the

construction. However, this behavior is not supported by numerical simulations
of turbulent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) accretion disks, which show that angular
momentum transport driven by the magnetorotational instability is inefficient
in this inner disk region. I will discuss the results of a recent study on the
generation of hydromagnetic stresses and energy density in the boundary layer
around a weakly magnetized star. Our findings suggest that although magnetic
energy density can be significantly amplified in this region, angular momentum
transport is rather inefficient. This seems consistent with the results
obtained in numerical simulations and suggests that the detailed structure of
turbulent MHD boundary layers could differ appreciably from those derived
within the standard framework of turbulent shear viscosity.

of about \pm 1 Gyr, hence their formation at redshifts z>~3 and their role in
hierarchical cosmology and the reionization of the intergalactic medium remain
relatively undetermined. Here we analyze the effect of globular cluster
formation on the observed rest-frame UV luminosity functions (LFs) and UV
continuum slopes of high redshift galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Fields. We
find that the majority of present day globular clusters have formed during two
distinct epochs: at redshifts z ~ 2-3 and at redshifts z>~6. The birth of
proto-GC systems produce the steep, faint-end slopes of the galaxy LFs, and
because the brightness of proto-GCs fades 5 Myrs after their formation, their
blue colors are in excellent agreement with observations.
  Our results suggest that: i) the bulk of the old globular cluster population
with estimated ages >~12 Gyr (about 50% of the total population), formed in the
relatively massive dwarf galaxies at redshifts z>~6; ii) proto-GC formation was
an important mode of star formation in those dwarf galaxies, and likely
dominated the reionization process. Another consequence of this scenario is
that some of the most massive Milky Way satellites may be faint and yet
undiscovered because tidal stripping of a dominant GC population precedes
significant stripping of the dark matter halos of these satellites. This
scenario may alleviate some remaining tensions between CDM simulations and
observations.

tend to diffuse; regarding increasing entropy, these two scenarios are
identical. What has been shown previously [2, 3] is that gravitational entropy

implications for learnability (bounded regret). We introduce a novel quantity
called {\em forward regret} that intuitively measures how good an online
learning algorithm is if it is allowed a one-step look-ahead into the future.
We show that given stability, bounded forward regret is equivalent to bounded
regret. We also show that the existence of an algorithm with bounded regret
implies the existence of a stable algorithm with bounded regret and bounded
forward regret. The equivalence results apply to general, possibly non-convex
problems. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis provides the first general
connection between stability and regret in the online setting that is not
restricted to a particular class of algorithms. Our stability-regret connection
provides a simple recipe for analyzing regret incurred by any online learning
algorithm. Using our framework, we analyze several existing online learning
algorithms as well as the ""approximate"" versions of algorithms like RDA that
solve an optimization problem at each iteration. Our proofs are simpler than
existing analysis for the respective algorithms, show a clear trade-off between
stability and forward regret, and provide tighter regret bounds in some cases.
Furthermore, using our recipe, we analyze ""approximate"" versions of several
algorithms such as follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) that requires solving

In this study, I propose a relation-based page rank algorithm to be used as a
Semantic Web search engine. Relevance is measured as the probability of finding
the connections made by the user at the time of the query, as well as the
information contained in the base knowledge of the Semantic Web environment. By
the use of ""virtual links"" between the concepts in a page, which are obtained
from the knowledge base, we can connect concepts and components of a page and
increase the probability score for a better ranking. By creating these
connections, this study also looks to eliminate the possibility of getting
results equal to zero, and to provide a tie-breaker solution when two or more
pages obtain the same score.

the adaptive optics mode of SINFONI. This is supplemented by kinematic data
from 48 z~1-2.5 galaxies from the literature. We find that the kinematic
classification of the high-z SFGs as `dispersion dominated' or `rotation
dominated' correlates most strongly with their intrinsic sizes. Smaller
galaxies are more likely `dispersion-dominated' for two main reasons: 1) The
rotation velocity scales linearly with galaxy size but intrinsic velocity
dispersion does not depend on size, and as such, their ratio is systematically
lower for smaller galaxies, and 2) Beam smearing strongly decreases large-scale
velocity gradients and increases observed dispersion much more for galaxies
with sizes at or below the resolution. Dispersion dominated SFGs may thus have
intrinsic properties similar to `rotation dominated' SFGs, but are primarily
more compact, lower mass, less metal enriched and may have higher gas
fractions, plausibly because they represent an earlier evolutionary state.

considered. Wireless devices report on each event using one of multiple

lengths. Delivering all data in the highest quality format can overload system
resources. The goal is to make intelligent format selection and routing
decisions to maximize time-averaged information quality subject to network
stability. Lyapunov optimization theory can be used to solve such a problem by
repeatedly minimizing the linear terms of a quadratic drift-plus-penalty
expression. To reduce delays, this paper proposes a novel extension of this
technique that preserves the quadratic nature of the drift minimization while
maintaining a fully separable structure. In addition, to avoid high queuing
delay, paths are restricted to at most two hops. The resulting algorithm can
push average information quality arbitrarily close to optimum, with a trade-off
in queue backlog. The algorithm compares favorably to the basic
drift-plus-penalty scheme in terms of backlog and delay. Furthermore, the
technique is generalized to solve linear programs and yields smoother results
than the standard drift-plus-penalty scheme.

of unit volume metrics on a given closed manifold are known to be precisely the
Einstein metrics. One may consider the modified problem of finding stationary
points for the volume functional on the space of metrics whose scalar curvature

by such stationary points to smooth bounded domains. The condition involves a
generalization of the static equations, and we interpret solutions (and their

that does not satisfy the condition, we establish a local deformation theorem
that allows one to achieve simultaneously small prescribed changes of the
scalar curvature and of the volume by a compactly supported variation of the
metric. We apply this result to obtain a localized gluing theorem for constant
scalar curvature metrics in which the total volume is preserved. Finally, we
note that starting from a counterexample of Min-Oo's conjecture such as that of
Brendle-Marques-Neves, counterexamples of arbitrarily large volume and
different topological types can be constructed.

coupled to the 2s2(1S) autoionizing state by a femtosecond infrared laser with
the intensity in the order of 10^{12} W/cm2. The simulation shows how the

realistic pulse conditions. We further account for the propagation of pulses in

meaningful output. The success of proteomics studies depends on the ability to
accurately and efficiently identify proteins. Many methods have been proposed
to facilitate the identification of proteins from the results of peptide
identification. However, the relationship between protein identification and
peptide identification has not been thoroughly explained before.
  In this paper, we are devoted to a combinatorial perspective of the protein
inference problem. We employ combinatorial mathematics to calculate the
conditional protein probabilities (Protein probability means the probability
that a protein is correctly identified) under three assumptions, which lead to
a lower bound, an upper bound and an empirical estimation of protein
probabilities, respectively. The combinatorial perspective enables us to obtain
a closed-form formulation for protein inference.
  Based on our model, we study the impact of unique peptides and degenerate
peptides on protein probabilities. Here, degenerate peptides are peptides
shared by at least two proteins. Meanwhile, we also study the relationship of
our model with other methods such as ProteinProphet. A probability confidence
interval can be calculated and used together with probability to filter the
protein identification result. Our method achieves competitive results with
ProteinProphet in a more efficient manner in the experiment based on two

and an independent set I arises with probability proportional to lambda^|I|. On
infinite graphs a Gibbs distribution is defined as a suitable limit with the
correct conditional probabilities. In the infinite setting we are interested in
determining when this limit is unique and when there is phase coexistence,
i.e., existence of multiple Gibbs states. On finite graphs we are interested in
determining the mixing time of local Markov chains.
  On Z^2 it is conjectured that these problems are related and that both
undergo a phase transition at some critical point lambda_c approx 3.79. For
phase coexistence, much of the work to date has focused on the regime of
uniqueness, with the best result being recent work of Restrepo et al. showing
that there is a unique Gibbs state for all lambda < 2.3882. Here we give the
first non-trivial result in the other direction, showing that there are
multiple Gibbs states for all lambda > 5.3646. Our proof adds two significant
innovations to the standard Peierls argument. First, building on the idea of
fault lines introduced by Randall, we construct an event that distinguishes two
boundary conditions and always has long contours associated with it, obviating
the need to accurately enumerate short contours. Second, we obtain vastly
improved bounds on the number of contours by relating them to a new class of
self-avoiding walks on an oriented version of Z^2.
  We extend our characterization of fault lines to show that local Markov
chains will mix slowly when lambda > 5.3646 on lattice regions with periodic
(toroidal) boundary conditions and when lambda > 7.1031 with non-periodic
(free) boundary conditions. The arguments here rely on a careful analysis that
relates contours to taxi walks and represent a sevenfold improvement to the
previously best known values of \lambda.

accurate waveforms for the signal model and effectual template banks that cover
the mass space of interest. We investigate the ability of the second-order
post-Newtonian TaylorF2 hexagonal template placement metric to construct an
effectual template bank, if the template waveforms used are effective one body
waveforms tuned to numerical relativity (EOBNRv2). We find that by combining
the existing TaylorF2 placement metric with EOBNRv2 waveforms, we can construct
an effectual search for BBHs with component masses in the range 3 Msolar <=
m_1, m_2 <= 25 Msolar. We also show that the (computationally less expensive)
TaylorF2 post-Newtonian waveforms can be used in place of EOBNRv2 waveforms
when M <~ 11.4 Msolar. Finally, we investigate the effect of modes other than
the dominant l = m = 2 mode in BBH searches. We find that for systems with
(m_1/m_2)<= 1.68 or inclination angle: \iota <= 0.31 or \iota >= 2.68 radians,
there is no significant loss in the total possible signal-to-noise ratio due to
neglecting modes other than l = m = 2 in the template waveforms. For a source
population uniformly distributed in spacial volume, over the entire sampled
region of the component-mass space, the loss in detection rate (averaged over a
uniform distribution of inclination angle and sky-location/polarization
angles), remains below ~11%. For binaries with high mass-ratios \textit{and}
0.31 <= \iota <= 2.68, including higher order modes could increase the
signal-to-noise ratio by as much as 8% in Advanced LIGO. Our results can be

collaborations have presented evidence for a Higgs boson with a mass in the 125
GeV range. We consider the 125 GeV neutral Higgs pair production process in the
context of large-extra-dimensions(LED) model including the Kaluza-Klein(KK)
excited gravitons at the LHC. We take into account the LED effects coming from
gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark collision channels as well as their
corresponding next-to-leading order(NLO) QCD loop induced corrections. We
analyse their impacts on both the total cross section and some key
distributions. Indeed,pp -> HH has the clear advantage of a lower standard
model(SM) background compare to process like pp -> jj, though its SM prediction
is very small, it is shown that the LED model raises the cross section of Higgs
pair production compare to its SM prediction and enhance the transverse
momentum(pHT) and invariant mass(MHH) Distributions especially at high scales
of pH T and MHH. By including the NLO QCD loop corrections, the scale
dependence of total cross section can be reduced obviously. Choose suitable
decay modes like HH -> bbrr or HH -> bbmumu and some simple cuts, we can
strongly reduce the SM background but keep most of the LED effects, leading
Higgs pair production a promising channel to search LED effects.

and the line flux of the double-peaked broad H$\alpha$ of the well-known mapped

emitters and normal broad line AGN. Based on the Virialization assumption and
the empirical relation about $R_{BLR}$, one strong negative correlation of line
parameters of the double-peaked broad lines should be expected for 3C390.3,
such as the negative correlation confirmed for the mapped broad line object
NGC5548. But, based on the public spectra around 1995 from the AGNWATCH project
for 3C390.3, one reliable positive correlation is found. In the context of the
proposed theoretical accretion disk model for double-peaked emitters, the
unexpected positive correlation can be naturally explained, due to different
time delays for inner parts and outer parts of disk-like BLR of 3C390.3.
Moreover, the Virialization assumption is checked and found to be still
available for 3C390.3. However, time-varying size of the BLR of 3C390.3 can not
be expected by the empirical relation $R_{BLR}\propto L^{\sim0.5}$, the
continuum emission strengthening leads to the size of BLR decreasing (not
increasing) in different moments for 3C390.3. Then, we compared our results of
3C390.3 with the previous results reported in the literature for the other
double-peaked emitters, and found that before to clearly correct effects from
disk physical parameters varying for long-term observed line spectra and
effects from the probable 'external' ionizing source with so far unclear
structures, it is hard to give one conclusion that the positive correlation can
be found for all double-peaked emitters. However, once one positive correlation
of broad line parameters was found, the accretion disk origination of the broad
line should be firstly considered.

falls much more steeply at high HI column densities as compared to the other
determinations. While $\sim 10%$ of the cross section above $\nh = 10^{20.3}
\acc$ at $z = 0$ is provided by dwarf galaxies, the fraction falls to $\lesssim
1%$ by $\nh \sim 10^{21.5} \acc.$ In the local universe, the contribution to
the high \nh\ end of the \fnh\ distribution comes predominantly from the
inclined disks of large galaxies. Dwarf galaxies, both because of their smaller
scale lengths, and their larger intrinsic axial ratios do not produce large HI
column densities even when viewed edge-on. If high column density DLAs/GRB
hosts correspond to galaxies like the local dwarfs, this would require either
that (i) the absorption arises from merging and not isolated systems or (ii)
the observed lines of sight are strongly biased towards high column density

gives access to the underlying dark matter distribution, which is related to
cosmological parameters and to the physics of the primordial Universe. The
estimation of the correlation function for current galaxy surveys makes use of
the Landy-Szalay estimator, which is supposed to reach minimal variance. This
is only true, however, for a vanishing correlation function. We study the
Landy-Szalay estimator when these conditions are not fulfilled and propose a
new estimator that provides the smallest variance for a given survey geometry.
Our estimator is a linear combination of ratios between paircounts of data
and/or random catalogues (DD, RR and DR). The optimal combination for a given
geometry is determined by using lognormal mock catalogues. The resulting
estimator is biased in a model-dependent way, but we propose a simple iterative
procedure for obtaining an unbiased model- independent estimator.Our method can
be easily applied to any dataset and requires few extra mock catalogues
compared to the standard Landy-Szalay analysis. Using various sets of simulated
data (lognormal, second-order LPT and N-Body), we obtain a 20-25% gain on the
error bars on the two-point correlation function for the SDSS geometry and
$\Lambda$CDM correlation function. When applied to SDSS data (DR7 and DR9), we
achieve a similar gain on the correlation functions, which translates into a
10-15% improvement over the estimation of the densities of matter $\Omega_m$
and dark energy $\Omega_\Lambda$ in an open $\Lambda$CDM model. The constraints
derived from DR7 data with our estimator are similar to those obtained with the
DR9 data and the Landy-Szalay estimator, which covers a volume twice as large

information on how a black hole relaxes after it has been perturbed and depend

hand, the examples studied so far in the literature focused on the case of
black hole geometries with singularities in their interior. On the other hand,
it is expected that quantum or classical modifications of general relativity
may correct the pathological singular behavior of classical black hole
solutions. Despite the fact that we do not have at hand a complete theory of
quantum gravity, regular black hole solutions can be constructed by coupling
gravity to an external form of matter, sometimes modeled by one form or another
of nonlinear electrodynamics. It is therefore relevant to compute quasinormal
frequencies for these regular solutions and see how differently, from the
ordinary ones, regular black holes ring. In this paper, we take a step in this
direction and, by computing the quasinormal frequencies, study the quasinormal
modes of neutral and charged scalar field perturbations on regular black hole

(i.e. directly from the data) is made challenging by the simple fact that
galaxy surveys offer at most a few independent samples. In addition, surveys
have non-trivial geometries, which make the interpretation of the observations
even trickier, but the uncertainty can nevertheless be worked out within the
Gaussian approximation. With the recent realization that Gaussian treatments of
the power spectrum lead to biased error bars about the dilation of the baryonic
acoustic oscillation scale, efforts are being directed towards developing
non-Gaussian analyses, mainly from N-body simulations so far. Unfortunately,
there is currently no way to tell how the non-Gaussian features observed in the
simulations compare to those of the real Universe, and it is generally hard to
tell at what level of accuracy the N-body simulations can model complicated
non-linear effects such as mode coupling and galaxy bias. We propose in this
paper a novel method that aims at measuring non-Gaussian error bars on the
matter power spectrum directly from galaxy survey data. We utilize known
symmetries of the 4-point function, Wiener filtering and principal component
analysis to estimate the full covariance matrix from only four independent
fields with minimal prior assumptions. With the noise filtering techniques and
only four fields, we are able to recover the Fisher information obtained from a
large N=200 sample to within 20 per cent, for k < 1.0 h/Mpc. Finally, we
provide a prescription to extract a noise-filtered, non-Gaussian, covariance
matrix from a handful of fields in the presence of a survey selection function.

to minimize generalized global cost functions. The key to our results is a
re-interpretation of the problem within the well-known two-dimensional Gantt

  We also consider a dynamic problem variant in which deciding upon the speed
is part of the scheduling problem and we are interested in the tradeoff between
scheduling cost and speed-scaling cost, which is typically the energy
consumption. We observe that the optimal order is independent of the energy
consumption and that the problem can be reduced to the setting where the speed
of the machine is fixed, and thus admits a PTAS. Furthermore, we provide an
FPTAS for the NP-hard problem variant in which the machine can run only on a

with different carbon abundances over the range 8.5 (C/He = 0.1%) to 10.5 (C/He
= 10%). The carbon abundances derived from C I lines are a factor of four lower
than that adopted for the model atmosphere over the same C/He interval, as
reported by Asplund et al.: 'the carbon problem'. In principle, the carbon
abundances obtained from C2 Swan bands and that adopted for the model
atmosphere can be equated for a particular choice of C/He that varies from star
to star (unlike C I lines). Then, the carbon problem for C2 bands is
eliminated. However, such C/He ratios are in general less than those of the
extreme helium stars, the seemingly natural relatives to the RCB and HdC stars.
The derived carbon abundances and the 12C/13C ratios are discussed in light of
the double degenerate (DD) and the final flash (FF) scenarios. The carbon
abundance and the 12C/13C ratios for the FF product, Sakurai's Object is
derived. The carbon abundance in the Sakurai's object is 10 times higher than
in the RCB star VZ Sgr. On an average, the carbon abundance in the Sakurai's
Object is about 10 to 100 times higher than in RCB stars. The 12C/13C ratio in
Sakurai's Object is 3.4, the equilibrium value, as expected for FF products.

the velocity field in a bounded domain from the boundary dynamic
Dirichlet-to-Neumann map (DDtN) for the wave equation. Three main results are
obtained: (1) assuming that two velocity fields are non-trapping and are equal
to a constant near the boundary, it is shown that the two induced scattering
relations must be identical if their corresponding DDtN maps are sufficiently
close; (2) a geodesic X-ray transform operator with matrix-valued weight is
introduced by linearizing the operator which associates each velocity field
with its induced Hamiltonian flow. A selected set of geodesics whose conormal
bundle can cover the cotangent space at an interior point is used to recover
the singularity of the X-ray transformed function at the point; a local
stability estimate is established for this case. Although fold caustics are
allowed along these geodesics, it is required that these caustics contribute to
a smoother term in the transform than the point itself. The existence of such a
set of geodesics is guaranteed under some natural assumptions in dimension
greater than or equal to three by the classification result on caustics and
regularity theory of Fourier Integral Operators. The interior point with the
above required set of geodesics is called ""fold-regular""; (3) assuming that a
background velocity field with every interior point fold-regular is fixed and
another velocity field is sufficiently close to it and satisfies a certain
orthogonality condition, it is shown that if the two corresponding DDtN maps
are sufficiently close then they must be equal.

levels and an acceptable carbon footprint in the face of rapidly increasing
data traffic in cellular networks in the coming years. The energy-saving
concept studied in this paper is the adaptation of a base station's (BS's)
transmit power levels and coverage area according to channel conditions and
traffic load. The traffic load in cellular networks exhibits significant
fluctuations in both space and time, which can be exploited, through cell range
adaptation, for energy saving. In this paper, we design short- and long-term BS
power control (STPC and LTPC respectively) policies for the OFDMA-based
downlink of a single-cell system, where bandwidth is dynamically and equally
shared among a random number of mobile users (MUs). STPC is a function of all
MUs' channel gains that maintains the required user-level quality of service
(QoS), while LTPC (including BS on-off control) is a function of traffic
density that minimizes the long-term energy consumption at the BS under a
minimum throughput constraint. We first develop a power scaling law that
relates the (short-term) average transmit power at BS with the given cell range
and MU density. Based on this result, we derive the optimal (long-term)
transmit adaptation policy by considering a joint range adaptation and LTPC
problem. By identifying the fact that energy saving at BS essentially comes
from two major energy saving mechanisms (ESMs), i.e. range adaptation and BS
on-off power control, we propose low-complexity suboptimal schemes with various
combinations of the two ESMs to investigate their impacts on system energy
consumption. It is shown that when the network throughput is low, BS on-off
power control is the most effective ESM, while when the network throughput is
higher, range adaptation becomes more effective.

allowing us to get rid of compactness assumptions on the manifold, and prove
many existence, uniqueness and finiteness results of Gibbs measures. We give
many applications, to the Variational Principle, the counting and
equidistribution of orbit points and periods, the unique ergodicity of the
strong unstable foliation and the classification of Gibbs densities on some
Riemannian covers.

possibility to explore the plethora of novel phenomena arising from the
interplay of magnetic field with QCD dynamics. On the experimental side, the
interest is motivated by the recent results on the behavior of quark-gluon

  Distribution in Urban Environment",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), the amount of interference from
neighboring nodes to a communication link is governed by the vehicle density
dynamics in vicinity and transmission probabilities of terminals. It is obvious
that vehicles are distributed non-homogeneously along a road segment due to
traffic controls and speed limits at different portions of the road. The common
assumption of homogeneous node distribution in the network in most of the
previous work in mobile ad-hoc networks thus appears to be inappropriate in
VANETs. In light of the inadequacy, we present in this paper an original
methodology to study the performance of VANETs with practical vehicle
distribution in urban environment. Specifically, we introduce the stochastic
traffic model to characterize the general vehicular traffic flow as well as the
randomness of individual vehicles, from which we can acquire the mean dynamics
and the probability distribution of vehicular density. As illustrative
examples, we demonstrate how the density knowledge from the stochastic traffic
model can be utilized to derive the throughput and progress performance of
three routing strategies in different channel access protocols. We confirm the
accuracy of the analytical results through extensive simulations. Our results
demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology on modeling protocol
performance, and shed insight into the performance analysis of other
transmission protocols and network configurations in vehicular networks.
Furthermore, we illustrate that the optimal transmission probability for
optimized network performance can be obtained as a function of the location
space from our results. Such information can be computed by road-side nodes and
then broadcasted to road users for optimized multi-hop packet transmission in
the communication network.

Theory compactified on a torus. Supermembrane theory realize S, T, so
U-duality, as exact symmetries of the theory. There are two well defined
sectors: with and without central charges. Both sectors have the SL(2,Z)xZ2
U-duality group in 9D as a symmetry of the theory, but the supermembrane with
central charges, also exhibits an extra SL(2,Z) symmetry of the theory
associated to the diffeomorphisms not connected with the identity changing the
homology basis. The Z2 symmetry is T-duality transformation that acts on the
supermembrane and generalize that of the string. This T-duality transformation
acts locally and also globally on the supermembrane theory. It has a natural
description in terms of the cohomology of the base manifold and the homology of
the target torus. When only string-like states are preserved, one recovers both
type II string theories in 9D. If one also consider properly limit of the
T-duality transformation characterizing the supermembrane, the usual closed
string T-duality transformation between the type IIA and type IIB mass
operators is recovered.

existence of a ""hidden"" sector that comprises particles with a vanishing or
very weak coupling to particles of the Standard Model (visible sector). For
very light (m < 10^-14 eV) hidden U(1) gauge bosons (hidden photons),
broad-band radio spectra of compact radio sources could be modified due to weak
kinetic mixing with radio photons. Here, search methods are developed and their
sensitivity discussed, with specific emphasis on the effect of the coherence
length of the signal, instrumental bandwidth, and spectral resolution. We
conclude that radio observations in the frequency range of 0.03--1400 GHz probe
kinetic mixing of ~10^-3 of hidden photons with masses down to ~10^-17 eV.
Prospects for improving the sensitivity with future radio astronomical

generates scale-invariant perturbations that, assuming a nonsingular bouncing
cosmology, propagate to the expanding branch and set appropriate initial
conditions for the radiation-dominated era. Since this scenario depends on the
presence of a bounce, it seems appropriate to consider it in the context of
loop quantum cosmology where a bouncing universe naturally arises. For a
pressureless collapsing universe in loop quantum cosmology, the predicted power
spectrum of the scalar perturbations after the bounce is scale-invariant and
the tensor to scalar ratio is negligibly small. A slight red tilt can be given
to the scale-invariance of the scalar perturbations by a scalar field whose
equation of state is $P = - \epsilon \rho$, where $\epsilon$ is a small
positive number. Then, the power spectrum for tensor perturbations is also
almost scale-invariant with the same red tilt as the scalar perturbations, and
the tensor to scalar ratio is expected to be $r \approx 9 \times 10^{-4}$.
Finally, for the predicted amplitude of the scalar perturbations to agree with
observations, the critical density in loop quantum cosmology must be of the
order $\rho_c \sim 10^{-9} \rho_{\rm Pl}$.

effects on atmosphereless planetary bodies reveals that the time needed to
alter the spectrum of an ordinary chondrite meteorite to resemble the overall
spectral shape and slope of an S-type asteroid is about ~ 0.1 Myr. The time
required to reduce the visible albedo of samples to ~ 0.05 is ~ 1 Myr. Since
both these timescales are much less than the average collisional lifetime of
asteroids larger than several kilometers in size, numerous low-albedo asteroids
having reddish spectra with subdued absorption bands should be observed instead
of an S-type dominated population. It is not the case because asteroid surfaces
cannot be considered as undisturbed, unlike laboratory samples. We have
estimated the number of collisions occurring in the time of 105 yr between
asteroids and projectiles of various sizes and show that impact-activated
motions of regolith particles counteract the progress of optical maturation of
asteroid surfaces. Continual rejuvenation of asteroid surfaces by impacts does
not allow bodies with the ordinary chondrite composition to be masked among S
asteroids. Spectroscopic analysis, using relatively invariant spectral
parameters, such as band centers and band area ratios, can determine whether
the surface of an S asteroid has chondritic composition or not. Differences in
the environment of the main asteroid belt versus that at 1 AU, and the physical
difference between the Moon and main belt asteroids (i.e., size) can account
for the lack of lunar-type weathering on main belt asteroids.

density functionals and covariance analysis to assess correlations between
observables for finite nuclei and neutron stars. In a first step two energy
functionals -- a high density energy functional giving reasonable neutron
properties, and a low density functional fitted to nuclear properties -- are
matched. In a second step, we optimize a new functional using exactly the same
protocol as in earlier studies pertaining to nuclei but now including neutron
star data. This allows direct comparisons of performance of the new functional
relative to the standard one. The new functional TOV-min yields results for
nuclear bulk properties (energy, r.m.s. radius, diffraction radius, surface
thickness) that are of the same quality as those obtained with the established
Skyrme functionals, including SV-min. When comparing SV-min and TOV-min,
isoscalar nuclear matter indicators vary slightly while isovector properties
are changed considerably. We discuss neutron skins, dipole polarizability,
separation energies of the heaviest elements, and proton and neutron drip
lines. We confirm a correlation between the neutron skin of $^{208}$Pb and the
neutron star radius. We demonstrate that standard energy density functionals
optimized to nuclear data do not carry information on the expected maximum
neutron star mass, and that predictions can only be made within an extremely
broad uncertainty band. For atomic nuclei, the new functional TOV-min performs
at least as well as the standard nuclear functionals, but it also reproduces
expected neutron star data within assumed error bands.

pulse period of 3.6s in 2008 March/April as observed with RXTE and INTEGRAL.
During the outburst the neutron star's luminosity varied by a factor of 10 in
the 3--50\,keV band. In agreement with earlier work we find evidence for five
cyclotron resonance scattering features at ~10.7, 21.8, 35.5, 46.7, and
59.7keV. Previous work had found an anti-correlation between the fundamental
cyclotron line energy and the X-ray flux. We show that this apparent
anti-correlation is probably due to the unphysical interplay of parameters of
the cyclotron line with the continuum models used previously, e.g., the
negative and positive exponent power law (NPEX). For this model, we show that
cyclotron line modeling erroneously leads to describing part of the exponential
cutoff and the continuum variability, and not the cyclotron lines. When the
X-ray continuum is modeled with a simple exponentially cutoff power law
modified by a Gaussian emission feature around 10keV, the correlation between
the line energy and the flux vanishes and the line parameters remain virtually
constant over the outburst. We therefore conclude that the previously reported
anti-correlation is an artifact of the assumptions adopted in the modeling of
the continuum.

circumstellar environments in scattered light at visible wavelengths. The
polarimeter uses the beam-exchange technique, in which the two orthogonal
polarization states are imaged simultaneously and a polarization modulator
swaps the polarization states of the two beams before the next image is taken.
The instrument currently operates without the aid of Adaptive Optics. To reduce
the effects of atmospheric seeing on the polarimetry, the images are taken at a
frame rate of 35 fps, and large numbers of frames are combined to obtain the
polarization images. Four successful observing runs have been performed using
this instrument at the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope on La Palma, targeting
young stars with protoplanetary disks as well as evolved stars surrounded by
dusty envelopes. In terms of fractional polarization, the instrument
sensitivity is better than 10^-4. The contrast achieved between the central

transition, the dramatic drop in the linear resistivity at the upper transition
$T_{c_1}$ coincides with the onset of nonlinearity, and upon further cooling is
followed by a pronounced peak in $V_{3 \omega}$ at the lower transition
$T_{c_2}$. Likewise, in the paramagnetic regime, a drop of the material's
magnetoresistance $R(H)$ precedes a magnetic-field-induced peak in nonlinear
transport. A striking observation is a linear temperature dependence of
$V_{3\omega}^{\rm peak}(H)$. We suggest a picture where at the upper transition
$T_{c_1}$ the coalescing MP form a conducting path giving rise to a strong
decrease in the resistance. The MP formation sets in at around $T^\ast \sim
35$\,K below which these entities are isolated and strongly fluctuating, while
growing in number. The MP then start to form links at $T_{c_1}$, where
percolative electronic transport is observed. The MP merge and start forming a
continuum at the threshold $T_{c_2}$. In the paramagnetic temperature regime

between nonlocal and local singlet formation is observed in corresponding
magnetic susceptibilities. The crossover is driven by the strong sensitivity of
the Kondo temperature on the local density of states.

systems and analyze the evolution of bipartite Gaussian states in independent
noisy channels. In particular, upon introducing the notion of dynamical path
through a suitable parametrization for symmetric states, we focus attention on
phenomena that are common to Markovian and non-Markovian Gaussian maps under
the assumptions of weak coupling and secular approximation. We found that the
dynamical paths in the parameter space are universal, that is they do depend
only on the initial state and on the effective temperature of the environment,
with non Markovianity that manifests itself in the velocity of running over a
given path. This phenomenon allows one to map non-Markovian processes onto
Markovian ones and it may reduce the number of parameters needed to study a
dynamical process, e.g. it may be exploited to build constants of motions valid
for both Markovian and non-Markovian maps. Universality is also observed in the
value of Gaussian discord at the separability threshold, which itself is a
function of the sole initial conditions in the limit of high temperature. We
also prove the existence of excluded regions in the parameter space, i.e. of
sets of states which cannot be linked by any Gaussian dynamical map.

their complexes with Ar atoms in the 50-250 1/cm range with an infrared free

The assigned structures are similar to those observed in several other

by the magnetic field of the flow itself. The magnetic accretion scenario can

efficient by allowing the user to assemble sequences of actions in atomic
transactions with all-or-nothing semantics. It is believed that, by its very
virtue, transactional memory must ensure that all committed transactions
constitute a serial execution respecting the real-time order. In contrast,
aborted or incomplete transactions should not ""take effect."" But what does ""not
taking effect"" mean exactly?
  It seems natural to expect that aborted or incomplete transactions do not
appear in the global serial execution, and, thus, no committed transaction can
be affected by them. We investigate another, less obvious, feature of ""not
taking effect"" called non-interference: aborted or incomplete transactions
should not force any other transaction to abort. In the strongest form of
non-interference that we explore in this paper, by removing a subset of aborted
or incomplete transactions from the history, we should not be able to turn an
aborted transaction into a committed one without violating the correctness
criterion.
  We show that non-interference is, in a strict sense, not implementable with
respect to the popular criterion of opacity that requires all transactions (be
they committed, aborted or incomplete) to witness the same global serial
execution. In contrast, when we only require local correctness,
non-interference is implementable. Informally, a correctness criterion is local
if it only requires that every transaction can be serialized along with (a
subset of) the transactions committed before its last event (aborted or
incomplete transactions ignored). We give a few examples of local correctness
properties, including the recently proposed criterion of virtual world
consistency, and present a simple though efficient implementation that
satisfies non-interference and local opacity.

This article describes some situations where $\alpha$ is injective and some
where it is not.
  We prove that if $A$ is a right Ore localization of $R[a]$ and $B$ is a right
Ore localization of $R[b]$, then $\alpha$ is injective. For example, the group
ring over $R$ of the free group on $\{1+a, 1+b\}$ is $R[ (1+a)^{\pm 1}]
\amalg_R R[ (1+b)^{\pm 1}]$, which then embeds in $R<< a,b>>$. We thus recover
a celebrated result of R H Fox, via a proof simpler than those previously

  We show that $\alpha$ is injective if $R$ is \textit{$\Pi$-semihereditary},
that is, every finitely generated, torsionless, right $R$-module is projective.
  The article concludes with some results contributed by G M Bergman that
describe situations where $\alpha$ is not injective. He shows that if $R$ is
commutative and $\text{w.gl.dim\,} R \ge 2$, then there exist examples where
the map $\alpha' \colon A \amalg_R B \to R<< a>>\amalg_R R<< b>>$ is not
injective, and hence neither is $\alpha$. It follows from a result of K R
Goodearl that when $R$ is a commutative, countable, non-self-injective, von
Neumann regular ring, the map $\alpha""\colon R<< a>>\amalg_R R<< b>> \to R<<
a,b>>$ is not injective. Bergman gives procedures for constructing other

exclusive determinations of $|V_{ub}|$. They are obtained by combining the
experimental branching ratios of $B \to \tau \nu$ and $B \to \pi l \nu$
(respectively) with a theoretical computation of the hadronic matrix elements
$\fB$ and the $B \to \pi$ form factor $f_+(q^2)$. To understand the tension,
improved precision and a careful analysis of the systematics involved are
necessary. We report the results of the ALPHA collaboration for $\fB$ from the
lattice with 2 flavors of $O(a)$ improved Wilson fermions. We employ HQET,
including $1/m_b$ corrections, with pion masses ranging down to $\approx$ 190
MeV. Renormalization and matching were performed non-perturbatively, and three
lattice spacings reaching $a^{-1}\approx 4.1$ GeV are used in the continuum
extrapolation. We also present progress towards a computation of $f_+(q^2)$, to
directly compare two independent exclusive determinations of $|V_{ub}|$ with
each other and with inclusive determinations. Additionally, we report on
preliminary results for $\fBq{s}$, needed for the analysis of $B_s \to
\mu^+\mu^-$.}

This model is integrable for both periodic and open boundary conditions, the
latter case includes the presence of Grassmann valued non-diagonal boundary
fields breaking the bulk U(1) symmetry of the model. Starting from the
embedding of this model into a graded Yang-Baxter algebra an infinite hierarchy
of comuting transfer matrices is constructed by means of a fusion procedure.
For certain values of the coupling constant related to anisotropies of the
underlying vertex model taken at roots of unity this hierarchy is shown to
truncate giving a finite set of functional equations for the spectrum of the
transfer matrices. For generic coupling constants the spectral problem is
formulated in terms of a TQ-equation which can be solved by Bethe ansatz
methods for periodic and diagonal open boundary conditions. Possible approaches
for the solution of the model with generic non-diagonal boundary fields are
discussed.

very small scintillator cells 3x3x0.5 cm^3. This technology allows the
construction of highly granular calorimeters used for excellent shower
separation and therefore outstanding jet energy resolution using the particle
flow concept. Since the SiPMs still have potential for further improvements, we
developed a setup dedicated to the measurement of parameters like the areal
distribution of relative photon detection efficiency and crosstalk probability
which are used to characterize and compare different devices. Thanks to the
precise positioning system together with excellent focusing of the light source
we are capable of scanning whole SiPMs with an area of ca. 1 mm^2 at a
sub-pixel resolution of 1-2 \mu{}m. A further alignment compensation feature
allows us to conduct separate analysis on each single pixel of a SiPM. We
present the technical description of our measurement setup and results obtained
for two types of SiPMs. The first one is a commercial Hamamatsu MPPC with 50
\mu{}m pixel size, the second one was the second iteration series SiMPl device
developed and manufactured in the Semiconductor Laboratory of the Max Planck

(cells). As in networks from real applications, coupled cell networks can
represent inhomogeneous networks where different types of cells interact with
each other in different ways, which can be represented graphically by different
symbols, or abstractly by equivalence relations.
  Various synchronous behaviors, from full synchrony to partial synchrony, can
be observed for a given network. Patterns of synchrony, which do not depend on
specific dynamics of the network, but only on the network structure, are
associated with a special type of partition of cells, termed balanced
equivalence relations. Algorithms in Aldis (2008) and Belykh and Hasler (2011)
find the unique pattern of synchrony with the least clusters. In this paper, we
compute the set of all possible patterns of synchrony and show their hierarchy
structure as a complete lattice.
  We represent the network structure of a given coupled cell network by a
symbolic adjacency matrix encoding the different coupling types. We show that
balanced equivalence relations can be determined by a matrix computation on the
adjacency matrix which forms a block structure for each balanced equivalence
relation. This leads to a computer algorithm to search for all possible
balanced equivalence relations. Our computer program outputs the balanced
equivalence relations, quotient matrices, and a complete lattice for user
specified coupled cell networks. Finding the balanced equivalence relations of
any network of up to 15 nodes is tractable, but for larger networks this
depends on the pattern of synchrony with least clusters.

characteristics attributed to ratings from Rating Agency pre-crisis. Business
over-reliance on ratings of questionable accuracy is seen as a cause of the
