network nodes and 3He impurities. The strong suppression of the shear modulus

low temperatures depends strongly on how the state was prepared. All the key

the thermomechanical path-dependent pinning length of dislocation networks.

for each species, as well as an upper limit to the column density of the

used the Meudon PDR code to run a homogeneous grid of models that spans a
reasonable range of densities, visual extinctions, cosmic ray ionisation rates
and far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation fields. The results of our modelling
indicate that the foreground cloud is composed of predominantly neutral diffuse
gas (n(H) = 100 cm-3) and is heavily irradiated by an external source of FUV
that most likely arises from the nearby Trapezium OB association. The cloud is
6 pc thick and bears many similarities with the so-called C+ interface between
Orion-KL and the Trapezium cluster, 2 pc south of OMC-2 FIR 4. We conclude that
the foreground cloud we detected is an extension of the C+ interface seen in
the direction of Orion KL, and interpret it to be the remains of the parental
cloud of OMC-1, which extends from OMC-1 up to OMC-2.

the Newtonian limit. The method is based on Lagrangian perturbation theory plus
two key theoretical extensions. One advance involves identifying and fixing a
previously ignored gauge-like degree of freedom relating quantities calculated
in LPT to those measured by a preferred Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
observer. Handling this connection between calculational and observer frames is
physically essential and ensures a momentum conserving description. The second
extension is to systematically re-expand the equations of motion to increase
LPT's radius of convergence to the maximum future time prior to orbit crossing.
The paper implements a complete algorithm and performs extensive ""proof of
principle"" tests of the new method, including direct comparison to known
solutions, evaluation of conserved quantities and formal convergence studies.
All are satisfactory. We show convergence is exponential in grid size and
Lagrangian order and polynomial in step size. There are three {\it powerful
advantages} afforded by the new technique: (1) it employs a smooth
representation of all fields and the results are not limited by particle
induced shot-noise errors, (2) it permits the numerical error to be controlled
by changing Lagrangian order and/or number of steps allowing, in principle,
arbitrarily small errors to be achieved prior to orbit crossing and (3) it
handles generic cold initial data (any periodic density and velocity fields,
including those with initial rotational components). Together, these properties
make the new technique well-suited to handle quasi-linear scales where analytic
methods and/or numerical simulations fail to provide suitably accurate answers.

AGN in terms of anisotropic radio and optical emission, together with different
orientations of the ejection axis to the line of sight, have been invoked for
many years. Recently, large samples of optical quasars, mainly from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, together with large radio samples, such as FIRST, have
become available. These hold the promise of providing more stringent tests of
unified schemes but, compared to previous samples, lack high resolution radio
maps. Nevertheless they have been used to investigate unified schemes, in some
cases yielding results which appear inconsistent with such theories. Here we
investigate using simulations how the selection effects to which such
investigations are subject can influence the conclusions drawn. In particular,
we find that the effects of limited resolution do not allow core-dominated
radio sources to be fully represented in the samples, that the effects of
limited sensitivity systematically exclude some classes of sources and the lack
of deep radio data make it difficult to decide to what extent closely separated
radio sources are associated. Nevertheless, we conclude that relativistic
unified schemes are entirely compatible with the current observational data.
For a sample selected from SDSS and FIRST which includes weak-cored triples we
find that the equivalent width of the [OIII] emission line decreases as
core-dominance increases, as expected, and also that core-dominated quasars are
optically brighter than weak-cored quasars.

thin accretion disk around a compact astrophysical object. Our study
investigates the global profile of the disk plasma, in order to fix the
conditions for the existence of a crystalline morphology and ring sequence, as
outlined by the local analysis pursued in [1, 2]. In the linear regime, when
the electromagnetic back-reaction of the plasma is small enough, we show the
existence of an oscillating radial behavior for the flux surface function which
very closely resembles the one outlined in the local model, apart from a radial
modulation of the amplitude. In the opposite limit, corresponding to a dominant
back-reaction in the magnetic structure over the field of central object, we
can recognize the existence of a ring-like decomposition of the disk, according
to the same modulation of the magnetic flux surface, and a smoother radial
decay of the disk density, with respect to the linear case. In this extreme
non-linear regime, the global model seems to predict a configuration very close
to that of the local analysis, but here the thermostatic pressure, crucial for
the equilibrium setting, is also radially modulated. Among the conditions
requested for the validity of such a global model, the confinement of the
radial coordinate within a given value sensitive to the disk temperature and to
the mass of the central objet, stands; however, this condition corresponds to
dealing with a thin disk configuration.

thus should be proportional to the $B$-meson decay constant $f_B$. However, as
pointed out a number of years ago, they can also be generated by rescattering
from processes whose amplitudes do not involve $f_B$, such as color-favored

typically considered as an obstacle that makes the achievement of cooperative
goals more difficult. In this work, we aim to highlight potential benefits of
such asynchrony phenomena to tasks involving symmetry breaking. Specifically,
in this paper, identical (except for their speeds) mobile agents are placed at
arbitrary locations on a cycle of length $n$ and use their speed difference in
order to rendezvous fast. We normalize the speed of the slower agent to be 1,
and fix the speed of the faster agent to be some $c>1$. (An agent does not know
whether it is the slower agent or the faster one.) The straightforward
distributed-race DR algorithm is the one in which both agents simply start
walking until rendezvous is achieved. It is easy to show that, in the worst
case, the rendezvous time of DR is $n/(c-1)$. Note that in the interesting
case, where $c$ is very close to 1 this bound becomes huge. Our first result is
a lower bound showing that, up to a multiplicative factor of 2, this bound is
unavoidable, even in a model that allows agents to leave arbitrary marks, even
assuming sense of direction, and even assuming $n$ and $c$ are known to agents.
That is, we show that under such assumptions, the rendezvous time of any

$c>3$. We then construct an algorithm that precisely matches the lower bound
for the case $c\leq 2$, and almost matches it when $c>2$. Moreover, our
algorithm performs under weaker assumptions than those stated above, as it does
not assume sense of direction, and it allows agents to leave only a single mark

investigate the setting in which no marks can be used at all, and show tight

local manner. A quasi-local interaction, which means that the interaction
occurs among only a few subsystems, is a crucial requirement for practical
engineering of a dissipative system. The key idea is that, first, an auxiliary
system having local interaction with environment is prepared, and then that
auxiliary system is coupled to the underlying target system via a set of
two-body Hamiltonians in such a way that a desired pure state is generated.
Moreover, we show that, even with a simple single-mode auxiliary system,
deterministic generation of an arbitrary approximate Gaussian cluster state is
possible, by devising an appropriate switching scheme. Lastly, we discuss in a
specific example how much a dissipation-induced pure Gaussian state can be
perturbed by decoherence and parameter error.

wave-packet approach to DC shot noise of independent electrons at finite
temperature was offered as an intuitive alternative to the sophisticated
theories, actual shot noise data often behave more complicated than the derived
simple expression. For example, so-called effective charge can deviate from
elementary electronic charge due to correlated tunnelings. Also, there are
cases where one wishes to know the full spectrum of the shot noise. It will be
of great use if a handy method for the shot noise in various experimental
situations is available. In this article, a classical wave-packet approach to
the shot noise is presented. The classical formulation provides a rigorous yet
straightforward formalism to compute the full spectrum and, furthermore,
clarifies the structure of Fano factor and effective charge. Additionally, the
role of realistic detectors and an application to cross correlation
measurements are also discussed. The present method can serve as an intuitive

community labels for the nodes are unknown and it is of major interest to
estimate them (i.e., community detection). Degree Corrected Block Model (DCBM)
is a popular network model. How to detect communities with the DCBM is an
interesting problem, where the main challenge lies in the degree heterogeneity.
We propose a new approach to community detection which we call the Spectral
Clustering On Ratios-of-Eigenvectors (SCORE). Compared to classical spectral
methods, the main innovation is to use the entry-wise ratios between the first
leading eigenvector and each of the other leading eigenvectors for clustering.
Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of the network. We first obtain the $K$ leading
eigenvectors of $A$, say, $\hat{\eta}_1,\ldots,\hat{\eta}_K$, and let $\hat{R}$
be the $n\times (K-1)$ matrix such that
$\hat{R}(i,k)=\hat{\eta}_{k+1}(i)/\hat{\eta}_1(i)$, $1\leq i\leq n$, $1\leq
k\leq K-1$. We then use $\hat{R}$ for clustering by applying the $k$-means
method. The central surprise is, the effect of degree heterogeneity is largely
ancillary, and can be effectively removed by taking entry-wise ratios between
$\hat{\eta}_{k+1}$ and $\hat{\eta}_1$, $1\leq k\leq K-1$. The method is
successfully applied to the web blogs data and the karate club data, with error
rates of $58/1222$ and $1/34$, respectively. These results are more
satisfactory than those by the classical spectral methods. Additionally,
compared to modularity methods, SCORE is easier to implement, computationally
faster, and also has smaller error rates. We develop a theoretic framework
where we show that under mild conditions, the SCORE stably yields consistent
community detection. In the core of the analysis is the recent development on
Random Matrix Theory (RMT), where the matrix-form Bernstein inequality is
especially helpful.

absorption lines are detected independently and simultaneously amongst the two

detections. The most frequently observed outflow phenomenology consists of two

the class $\Lambda$ in the $s$-variate case. We consider two classes $\Lambda$:
the class $\Lambda^{{\rm all}}$ consists of all linear functionals and the
class $\Lambda^{{\rm std}}$ consists of only function valuations.
  We study (EXP) exponential convergence. This means that $$
e^{L_2-\mathrm{app},\Lambda}(n,s) \le C(s)\,q^{\,(n/C_1(s))^{p(s)}}\quad{for

(UEXP) uniform exponential convergence. We also study EXP and UEXP with (WT)
weak, (PT) polynomial and (SPT) strong polynomial tractability. These concepts
are defined as follows. Let $n(\e,s)$ be the minimal $n$ for which
$e^{L_2-\mathrm{app},\Lambda}(n,s)\le \e$. Then WT holds iff
$\lim_{s+\log\,\e^{-1}\to\infty}(\log n(\e,s))/(s+\log\,\e^{-1})=0$, PT holds

cs^{\tau_1}(1+\log\,\e^{-1})^{\tau_2}$ for all $s$ and $\e\in(0,1)$, and
finally SPT holds iff the last estimate holds for $\tau_1=0$. The infimum of
$\tau_2$ for which SPT holds is called the exponent $\tau^*$ of SPT. We prove
that the results are the same for both classes $\Lambda$, and obtain conditions
for WT, PT, SPT with and without EXP and UEXP.

algorithm that means features are invariant to six affine parameters namely
translation (2 parameters), zoom, rotation and two camera axis orientations.
The features are very reliable and give us strong keypoints that can be used
for matching between different images of an object. We trained an object in
several images with different aspects for finding best keypoints of it. Then, a
robust region merging algorithm is used to recognize and detect the object with
full boundary in the other images based on ASIFT keypoints and a similarity
measure for merging regions in the image. Experimental results show that the

reddening of <E(B-V)>=4.19+/-0.23 and <E(J-Ks)>=1.70+/-0.21. Due to the heavy
extinction toward the cluster, the zero-age main sequence fitting method based
on optical photometry proved to be inappropriate for the distance
determination, while the near-infrared photometry gave a reliable distance to
the cluster -- 3.8 kpc from the empirical relation. Using the recent
theoretical stellar evolution models with rotation, the age of the cluster is
estimated to be 5.0+/-1.0 Myr. We derived the IMF in the massive part and
obtained a fairly shallow slope of {\Gamma} = -0.8 +/- 0.1. The integration of
the IMF gave a total mass for the cluster in excess of 5.0 x 10^4 solar mass.
The IMF shows a clear radial variation indicating the presence of mass
segregation. We also discuss the possible star formation history of Westerlund
1 from the presence of red supergiants and relatively low-luminosity yellow
hypergiants.

peculiar feature in the relativistic electron population at a shock wave, where
their energy distribution is steeper than typically found in supernova remnants
(SNRs) and than the prediction from the standard diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) mechanism. This is especially established for a class of stripped
envelope supernovae (SNe IIb/Ib/Ic) where a combination of high shock velocity
and low circumstellar material (CSM) density makes it easier to derive the
intrinsic energy distribution than in other classes of SNe. We suggest that
this apparent discrepancy reflects the situation that the low energy electrons
before accelerated by the DSA-like mechanism are responsible for the radio
synchrotron emission from young SNe, and that studying young SNe sheds light on
the still-unresolved electron injection problem in the acceleration theory of
cosmic rays. We suggest that electron's energy distribution could be flattened
toward the high energy, most likely around 100 MeV, which marks a transition
from inefficient to efficient acceleration. Identifying this feature will be a
major advance in understanding the electron acceleration mechanism. We suggest
two further probes: (1) mm/sub-mm observations in the first year after the
explosion, and (2) X-ray observations at about 1 year and thereafter. We show
that these are reachable by ALMA and Chandra for nearby SNe.

Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, which is caused by the inverse Compton
scattering of CMB photons by high energy electrons in the intracluster medium
of galaxy clusters. We modify a public version of the JADE (Joint Approximate
Diagonalization of Eigenmatrices) algorithm, to deal with noisy data, and then
use this algorithm as a tool to search for SZ clusters in two simulated
datasets. The first dataset is composed of simple ""homemade"" simulations and
the second of full sky simulations of high angular resolution, available at the
LAMBDA (Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis) website. The
process of component separation can be summarized in four main steps: (1)
pre-processing based on wavelet analysis, which performs an initial cleaning
(denoising) of data to minimize the noise level; (2) the separation of the
components by JADE; (3) the calibration of the recovered SZ map; and (4) the
identification of the positions and intensities of the clusters using the
SExtractor software. The results show that our JADE-based algorithm is
effective in identifying the position and intensity of the SZ clusters, with
the purities being higher then 90% for the extracted ""catalogues"". This value
changes slightly according to the characteristics of noise and the number of
components included in the input maps. The main highlight of our developed work
is the effective recovery rate of SZ sources from noisy data, with no a priori
assumptions. This powerful algorithm can be easily implemented and become an
interesting complementary option to the ""matched filter"" algorithm widely used

Fast Outflows (UFOs) from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) result in considerable
feedback of energy and momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host
galaxy. The AGN wind interacts strongly with the inhomogeneous, two-phase ISM
consisting of dense clouds embedded in a tenuous hot hydrostatic medium. The
outflow floods through the inter-cloud channels, sweeps up the hot ISM, and
ablates and disperses the dense clouds. The momentum of the UFO is primarily
transferred to the dense clouds via the ram pressure in the channel flow, and
the wind-blown bubble evolves in the energy-driven regime. Any dependence on
UFO opening angle disappears after the first interaction with obstructing
clouds. On kpc scales, therefore, feedback by UFOs operates similarly to
feedback by relativistic AGN jets. Negative feedback is significantly stronger
if clouds are distributed spherically, rather than in a disc. In the latter
case the turbulent backflow of the wind drives mass inflow toward the central
black hole. Considering the common occurrence of UFOs in AGN, they are likely
to be important in the cosmological feedback cycles of galaxy formation.

in cosmological reionization as luminous sources of ultra-violet (UV) photons.
However, the remnants of these massive stars could be equally important as
X-ray luminous (L_X 1e38 erg/s) high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). Because the
absorption cross section of neutral hydrogen decreases sharply with photon
energy (proportional to the inverse cube), X-rays can escape more freely than
UV photons from the star-forming regions in which they are produced, allowing
HMXBs to make a potentially significant contribution to the ionizing X-ray
background during reionization. In this paper, we explore the ionizing power of
HMXBs at redshifts z > 6 using a Monte Carlo model for a coeval stellar
population of main sequence stars and HMXBs. Using the archetypal Galactic HMXB
Cygnus X-1 as our template, we propose a composite HMXB spectral energy
distribution consisting of black-body and power-law components, whose
contributions depend on the accretion state of the system. We determine the
time-dependent ionizing power of a combined population of UV-luminous stars and
X-ray luminous HMXBs, and deduce fitting formulae for the boost in the
population's ionizing power arising from HMXBs; these fits allow for simple
implementation of HMXB feedback in numerical simulations. Based on this
analysis, we estimate the contribution of high redshift HMXBs to the
present-day soft X-ray background, and we show that it is a factor of ~100-1000
smaller than the observed limit. Finally, we discuss the implications of our
results for the role of HMXBs in reionization and in high redshift galaxy
formation.

Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is
nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique

Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to

allocation of primary user (PU) network and secondary user (SU) network in
OFDM-based cognitive radio (CR) networks. We formulate the PU and the SUs as
the leader and the followers, respectively. We consider two constraints: the
total power constraint and the interference-to-signal ratio (ISR) constraint,
in which the ratio between the accumulated interference and the received signal
power at each PU should not exceed certain threshold. Firstly, we focus on the
single-PU and multi-SU scenario. Based on the analysis of the Stackelberg
Equilibrium (SE) for the proposed Stackelberg game, an analytical hierarchic
power allocation method is proposed when the PU can acquire the additional
information to anticipate SUs' reaction. The analytical algorithm has two
steps: 1) The PU optimizes its power allocation with considering the reaction
of SUs to its action. In the power optimization of the PU, there is a sub-game
for power allocation of SUs given fixed transmit power of the PU. The existence
and uniqueness for the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the sub-game are investigated.
We also propose an iterative algorithm to obtain the NE, and derive the
closed-form solutions of NE for the perfectly symmetric channel. 2) The SUs
allocate the power according to the NE of the sub-game given PU's optimal power
allocation. Furthermore, we design two distributed iterative algorithms for the
general channel even when private information of the SUs is unavailable at the
PU. The first iterative algorithm has a guaranteed convergence performance, and
the second iterative algorithm employs asynchronous power update to improve
time efficiency. Finally, we extend to the multi-PU and multi-SU scenario, and
a distributed iterative algorithm is presented.

promising technologies for the next generation of broadband, interactive,
multibeam, satellite communication (SatCom) systems. Results in the existing
literature have shown that when full frequency and polarization reuse is
employed and user signals are jointly processed at the gateway, more than
threefold gains in terms of spectral efficiency over conventional systems can
be obtained. However, the information theoretic results for the capacity of the
multibeam satellite channel, are given under ideal assumptions, disregarding
the implementation constraints of such an approach. Considering a real system
implementation, the adoption of full resource reuse is bound to increase the
payload complexity and power consumption. Since the novel techniques require
extra payload resources, fairness issues in the comparison among the two
approaches arise. The present contribution evaluates in a fair manner, the
performance of the return link (RL) of a SatCom system serving mobile users
that are jointly decoded at the receiver. More specifically, the achievable
spectral efficiency of the assumed system is compared to a conventional system
under the constraint of equal physical layer resource utilization. Furthermore,
realistic link budgets for the RL of mobile SatComs are presented, thus
allowing the comparison of the systems in terms of achievable throughput. Since
the proposed systems operate under the same payload requirements as the
conventional systems, the comparison can be regarded as fair. Finally, existing
analytical formulas are also employed to provide closed form descriptions of
the performance of clustered multibeam MUD, thus introducing insights on how
the performance scales with respect to the system parameters.

dispersion in the interstellar plasma. At a typical observing wavelength, this
delay can vary by tens of microseconds on five-year time scales, far in excess
of signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays, such as that induced by a
gravitational-wave background. Measurement of these delay variations is not
only crucial for the detection of such signals, but also provides an
unparallelled measurement of the turbulent interstellar plasma at au scales. In
this paper we demonstrate that without consideration of wavelength- independent
red-noise, 'simple' algorithms to correct for interstellar dispersion can
attenuate signals of interest to pulsar timing arrays. We present a robust
method for this correction, which we validate through simulations, and apply it
to observations from the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. Correction for dispersion
variations comes at a cost of increased band-limited white noise. We discuss
scheduling to minimise this additional noise, and factors, such as
scintillation, that can exacerbate the problem. Comparison with scintillation
measurements confirms previous results that the spectral exponent of electron
density variations in the interstellar medium often appears steeper than
expected. We also find a discrete change in dispersion measure of PSR
J1603-7202 of ~2x10^{-3} cm^{-3}pc for about 250 days. We speculate that this
has a similar origin to the 'extreme scattering events' seen in other sources.
In addition, we find that four pulsars show a wavelength-dependent annual
variation, indicating a persistent gradient of electron density on an au
spatial scale, which has not been reported previously.

the topic of dual satellite systems, in which satellites share spatial (i.e.
same coverage area) and spectral (i.e. full frequency reuse) degrees of freedom
is introduced. In each multibeam satellite, multiuser interferences are
mitigated by employing zero forcing precoding with realistic per antenna power
constraints. However, the two sets of users that the transmitters are
separately serving, interfere. The present contribution, proposes the partial
cooperation, namely coordination between the two coexisting transmitters in
order to reduce interferences and enhance the performance of the whole system,
while maintaining moderate system complexity. In this direction, a heuristic,
iterative, low complexity algorithm that allocates users in the two interfering
sets is proposed. This novel algorithm, improves the performance of each
satellite and of the overall system, simultaneously. The first is achieved by
maximizing the orthogonality between users allocated in the same set, hence
optimizing the zero forcing performance, whilst the second by minimizing the
level of interferences between the two sets. Simulation results show that the
proposed method, compared to conventional techniques, significantly increases

white dwarf offers a very attractive model to explain the inferred
characteristics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The resulting ejecta are
chemically stratified, have the same mass and roughly the same asymptotic
kinetic energy, but exhibit a range in 56Ni mass. We investigate the
contemporaneous photometric and spectroscopic properties of a sequence of
delayed-detonation models, characterized by 56Ni masses between 0.18 and 0.81
Msun. Starting at 1d after explosion, we perform the full non-LTE,
time-dependent radiative transfer with the code CMFGEN, with an accurate
treatment of line blanketing, and compare our results to SNe Ia at bolometric
maximum. Despite the 1D treatment, our approach delivers an excellent agreement
to observations. We recover the range of SN Ia luminosities, colours, and
spectral characteristics from the near-UV to 1 micron, for standard as well as
low-luminosity 91bg-like SNe Ia. Our models predict an increase in rise time to
peak with increasing 56Ni mass, from ~15 to ~21d, yield peak bolometric
luminosities that match Arnett's rule to within 10%, and reproduce the much
smaller scatter in near-IR magnitudes compared to the optical. We reproduce the
morphology of individual spectral features, the stiff dependence of the R(Si)
spectroscopic ratio on 56Ni mass, and the onset of blanketing from TiII/ScII in
low-luminosity SNe Ia with a 56Ni mass <0.3 Msun. We find that ionization
effects, which often dominate over abundance variations, can produce
high-velocity features in CaII lines, even in 1D. Distinguishing between
different SN Ia explosion mechanisms is a considerable challenge but the

show that lowering the value of the coefficient of friction leads to a
transition toward a different behavior, similar to that of a viscous fluid, and
where the filling height becomes active in the discharge process. The pressure
field shows that large enough values of the coefficient of friction ($\simeq$
0.3) allow for a low-pressure cavity to form above the outlet, and can thus
explain the Beverloo scaling. In conclusion, the difference between the
discharge of a hourglass and a clepsydra seems to reside in the existence or
not of a plastic yield stress.

the flow develops an oscillatory motion with a well-defined frequency which

the flow velocity and grains friction properties. The study of the influence of

to the star (based on its spectral type) suggest that the star was expelled
from the cluster, while the young age of the cluster (~2 Myr) implies that the
ejection was caused by a dynamical few-body encounter in the cluster's core.
The relative position on the sky of the O6 V star and a recently discovered O2
If*/WN6 star (located on the opposite side of NGC 3603) allows us to propose
that both objects were ejected from the cluster via the same dynamical event --
a three-body encounter between a single (O6 V) star and a massive binary (now
the O2 If*/WN6 star). If our proposal is correct, then one can ""weigh"" the O2
If*/WN6 star using the conservation of the linear momentum. Given a mass of the
O6 V star of 30 Msun, we found that at the moment of ejection the mass of the
O2 If*/WN6 star was 175 Msun. Moreover, the observed X-ray luminosity of the O2

originally binary system have merged (e.g., because of encounter hardening).

easier to derive than the IMEX ones, specially when aiming at higher-order (up

classical strong-stability-preserving optimal explicit RK methods for the
purely explicit part. The resulting partially implicit RK methods do not
require any inversion of operators and hence their computational cost per
iteration is similar to those of explicit RK methods. We analyse the stability
and convergence properties and show their practical applicability in several

solve the problems through convex programming when full CSI or CSI of the

the benefit of having full CSI at the relays for both optimization problems.
However, they also show that CSI overhead can be reduced by having only partial

  preliminary version of this paper appeared as arXiv:1202.2209",,,,"cs.GT cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the natural objectives of the field of the social networks is to
predict agents' behaviour. To better understand the spread of various products
through a social network arXiv:1105.2434 introduced a threshold model, in which
the nodes influenced by their neighbours can adopt one out of several
alternatives. To analyze the consequences of such product adoption we associate
here with each such social network a natural strategic game between the agents.
  In these games the payoff of each player weakly increases when more players
choose his strategy, which is exactly opposite to the congestion games. The
possibility of not choosing any product results in two special types of (pure)
Nash equilibria.
  We show that such games may have no Nash equilibrium and that determining an
existence of a Nash equilibrium, also of a special type, is NP-complete. This
implies the same result for a more general class of games, namely polymatrix
games. The situation changes when the underlying graph of the social network is
a DAG, a simple cycle, or, more generally, has no source nodes. For these three
classes we determine the complexity of an existence of (a special type of) Nash
equilibria.
  We also clarify for these categories of games the status and the complexity
of the finite best response property (FBRP) and the finite improvement property

satisfied when the underlying graph is a simple cycle, but determining it is
co-NP-hard in the general case and also when the underlying graph has no source
nodes. The latter complexity results also hold for the property of being a
weakly acyclic game. A preliminary version of this paper appeared as [19].

Dependence of the flame velocity on the turbulent length scale, on the
turbulent intensity and on the density variations is investigated in the case

versus the number of electrons is a series of linear segments between integer
points. However, commonly used approximate density functionals produce total
energies that do not exhibit this piecewise-linear behavior. As a result, the
ionization potential theorem, equating the highest occupied eigenvalue with the
ionization potential, is grossly disobeyed. Here, we show that, contrary to
conventional wisdom, most of the required piecewise-linearity of an arbitrary
approximate density functional can be restored by careful consideration of the
ensemble generalization of DFT. Furthermore, the resulting formulation
introduces the desired derivative discontinuity to any approximate
exchange-correlation functional, even one that is explicitly density-dependent.
This opens the door to calculations of the ionization potential and electron
affinity even without explicit electron removal or addition. All these advances
are achieved while neither introducing empiricism nor changing the underlying

10978, which has the best limb-to-limb data coverage with Hinode's EUV Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS). We find that the observed evolution is largely due to the
solar rotation progressively changing the viewpoint of nearly stationary flows.
From the systematic changes in the upflow regions as a function of distance
from disc centre, we deduce their 3D geometrical properties as inclination and
angular spread in three coronal lines (SiVII, FeXII, FeXV). In agreement with
magnetic extrapolations, we find that the flows are thin, fan-like structures
rooted in quasi separatrix layers (QSLs). The fans are tilted away from the AR
centre. The highest plasma velocities in these three spectral lines have
similar magnitudes and their heights increase with temperature. The spatial
location and extent of the upflow regions in the SiVII, FeXII and FeXV lines
are different owing to (i) temperature stratification and (ii) line of sight
integration of the spectral profiles with significantly different backgrounds.
We conclude that we sample the same flows at different temperatures. Further,
we find that the evolution of line widths during the disc passage is compatible

results are compatible with the AR upflows originating from reconnections along
QSLs between over-pressure AR loops and neighboring under-pressure loops. The
flows are driven along magnetic field lines by a pressure gradient in a
stratified atmosphere. We propose that, at any given time, we observe the
superposition of flows created by successive reconnections, leading to a broad
velocity distribution.

Shape of these spectra was analyzed in term of two models: (i) an
incommensurate spin density wave modulation of iron magnetic structure, (ii) a
formation of a microdomain structure or phase separation. It was shown that the
hyperfine parameters obtained using these two methods have very similar values

the following picture was conjectured to hold. As long as $p$ is below the
percolation threshold $p_c=1/k$ the process is ergodic with a finite relaxation
time while, for $p>p_c$, the process on the infinite tree is no longer ergodic
and the relaxation time on a finite regular sub-tree becomes exponentially
large in the depth of the tree. At the critical point $p=p_c$ the process on
the infinite tree is still ergodic but with an infinite relaxation time.
Moreover, on finite sub-trees, the relaxation time grows polynomially in the
depth of the tree.
  The conjecture was recently proved by the second and forth author except at
criticality. Here we analyse the critical and quasi-critical case and prove for
the relevant time scales: (i) power law behaviour in the depth of the tree at
$p=p_c$ and (ii) power law scaling in $(p_c-p)^{-1}$ when $p$ approaches $p_c$

three lower than the cosmic average. This is despite the fact that the UMa
cloud resides in a region of the Universe that is an apparent overdensity. A
possible explanation for this is that most mass in the Universe lies in the
empty space between clusters. Herewith, the mean distances and velocities of
the UMa groups follow nearly undisturbed Hubble flow without a sign of the

synchronize by virtue of a hydrodynamic coupling that depends on the motion of

instabilities) problem: eigenvalue (dispersion relation) solver and initial
value solver. In fact, we can introduce an idea of the combination of them,
i.e., we keep time derivative dt term (and other term if have, e.g., kinetic dv
term), but transform the linear spatial derivatives dx term to ik, which then
can reduce the computational dimensions. For example, most (fluid and kinetic)
normal mode problems can be reduced from treating cumbersome PDEs to treating
simple ODEs. Examples for MHD waves, cold plasma waves and kinetic Landau
damping are given, which show to be extremely simple or even may be the
simplest method for simulating them. [I don't know whether this idea is new,
but it seems very interesting and useful. So, I choose making it public.]

  films","7 pages, 7 figures",,,,"physics.optics cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transparent conducting oxides (TCO) are emerging as possible alternative
constituent materials to replace noble metals such as silver and gold for
low-loss plasmonic and metamaterial (MMs) applications in the near infrared
(NIR) regime. The optical characteristics of TCOs have been studied to evaluate
the functionalities and potential of these materials as metal substitutes in
plasmonic and MM devices, even apart from their usual use as electrode
materials. However, patterning TCOs at the nanoscale, which is necessary for
plasmonic and MM devices, is not well-studied. This paper investigates
nanopatterning processes for TCOs, especially the lift-off technique with
electron-beam lithography, and the realization of plasmonic nanostructures with
TCOs. By employing the developed nanopatterning process, we fabricate
2D-periodic arrays of TCO nanodisks and characterize the material's plasmonic
properties to evaluate the performance of TCOs as metal substitutes.
Light-induced collective oscillations of the free electrons in the TCOs (bulk
plasmons) and localized surface plasmon resonances are observed in the
wavelength range from 1.6 to 2.1 micron. Well-defined resonance peaks are
observed, which can be dramatically tuned by varying the amount of dopant and
by thermally annealing the TCO nanodisks in nitrogen gas ambient while
maintaining the low-loss properties.

show that a Riemann-Cartan first order gravity emerges. An analogy with quantum
chromodynamics is also formulated. Under this analogy it is possible to
associate a soft BRST breaking to a continuous deformation between both sectors
of the theory, namely, ultraviolet and infrared. Moreover, instead of hadrons

determined from the dynamical content of the theory.

It aims at 10 times better sensitivity, a better angular resolution and wider

In order to achieve this level of performance, both the design of the
telescopes and the analysis algorithms are being studied and optimized within
the CTA Monte-Carlo working group. Here, we present ongoing work on the data
analysis for both the event reconstruction (energy, direction) and gamma/hadron
separation, carried out within the HAP (H.E.S.S. Analysis Package) software
framework of the H.E.S.S. collaboration, for this initial study. The event
reconstruction uses both Hillas-parameter-based algorithms and an improved
version of the 3D-Model algorithm. For the gamma/hadron discrimination,
original and robust discriminant variables are used and treated with Boosted
Decision Trees (BDTs) in the TMVA (Toolkit for Multivariate Data Analysis)
framework. With this advanced analysis, known as Paris-MVA, the sensitivity is
improved by a factor of about 2 in the core range of CTA relative to the
standard analyses. Here we present the algorithms used for the reconstruction
and discrimination, together with the resulting performance characteristics,
with good confidence, since the method has been successfully applied for

solar-type stars. In these objects, production of energy by nuclear burning has
ended which means that a white dwarf simply cools down over the course of the
next billion years. It is now known that white dwarfs spend some of their
cooling history in an instability strip. The pulsating white dwarfs with an
hydrogen atmosphere (called DAV or ZZ Ceti stars) show non-radial oscillation
modes with periods in the range 100 - 1200s. In this work we try to illustrate
how the oscillation p-mode frequencies of idealized white dwarf models change
as the result of a different chemical composition in the core, with the
ultimate goal of determining the chemical stratification from seismic
observations. The presence of acoustic glitches in the internal structure
results in a periodic signal in the frequencies. We find that this signal
depends on the chemical stratification/composition of the core in a form that
can be analytically modelled.

scale, because the extra modes from the graviton multiplet involve higher
derivative self-interactions, controlled by a scale convoluted from the small
graviton mass. Generically, these correct the propagator by environmental
effects. The resulting effective cutoff depends on the environmental parameters
and the graviton mass. Requiring the theory to be perturbative down to ${\cal
O}(1) mm$, we derive bounds on the graviton mass, corresponding to $\gtrsim
{\cal O}(1) meV$ for the generic case, and somewhat weaker bounds in cases of
fine-tuning. In all cases the mass is required to be much too large for the
theory to conform with GR at cosmological distances. Similar results also hold
in quartic and quintic Galileon theory.

timing, due to relative simultaneity in consequence of the Lorentz
transformation. Since clock synchronisation is a convention in special theory
of relativity, instead of the Einstein's procedure one may choose such that
offers absolute simultaneity. We present in short the corresponding formalism
in one spatial dimension. We show that paradoxes do not arise with this choice
of synchronisation and descriptions of these issues are exceptionally simple
and consistent for both observers involved.

the modified Hawking temperature on the event horizon. Here the Hawking
temperature is generalized by multiplying the modified Hawking temperature by a
variable parameter \alpha representing the ratio of the growth rate of the
apparent horizon to the event horizon. It is found that both the first and the
generalized second law of thermodynamics are valid on the event horizon for any
fluid distribution. Subsequently, Bekenstein entropy is modified on the event

recovery of compressible data. Recently, it has been extended by Pham and
Venkatesh to cope with the case where corruption to the CS data is modeled as
impulsive noise. The new formulation, termed as robust CS, combines robust
statistics and CS into a single framework to suppress outliers in the CS
recovery. To solve the newly formulated robust CS problem, Pham and Venkatesh
suggested a scheme that iteratively solves a number of CS problems, the
solutions from which converge to the true robust compressed sensing solution.
However, this scheme is rather inefficient as it has to use existing CS solvers
as a proxy. To overcome limitation with the original robust CS algorithm, we
propose to solve the robust CS problem directly in this paper and drive more
computationally efficient algorithms by following latest advances in
large-scale convex optimization for non-smooth regularization. Furthermore, we
also extend the robust CS formulation to various settings, including additional
affine constraints, $\ell_1$-norm loss function, mixed-norm regularization, and
multi-tasking, so as to further improve robust CS. We also derive simple but
effective algorithms to solve these extensions. We demonstrate that the new
algorithms provide much better computational advantage over the original robust
CS formulation, and effectively solve more sophisticated extensions where the
original methods simply cannot. We demonstrate the usefulness of the extensions
on several CS imaging tasks.

introduced. Some algorithms related to the above multi-valued linear-time
properties are discussed. The verification of multi-valued regular safety
properties and multi-valued $\omega$-regular properties using lattice-valued
automata are thoroughly studied. Since the law of non-contradiction (i.e.,
$a\wedge \neg a=0$) and the law of excluded-middle (i.e., $a\vee \neg a=1$) do
not hold in multi-valued logic, the linear-time properties introduced in this
paper have the new forms compared to those in classical logic. Compared to
those classical model checking methods, our methods to multi-valued model
checking are more directly accordingly. A new form of multi-valued model
checking with membership degree is also introduced. In particular, we show that
multi-valued model-checking can be reduced to the classical model checking. The
related verification algorithms are also presented. Some illustrative examples
and case study are also provided.
