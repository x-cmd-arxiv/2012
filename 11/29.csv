dynamics of chemical reaction networks that are complex-balanced and are
governed by mass action kinetics. The formulation is based on the graph of
(substrate and product) complexes and the stoichiometric information of these
complexes, and crucially uses a balanced weighted Laplacian matrix. It is shown
that this formulation leads to elegant methods for characterizing the space of
all equilibria for complex-balanced networks and for deriving stability
properties of such networks. We propose a method for model reduction of
complex-balanced networks, which is similar to the Kron reduction method for
electrical networks and involves the computation of Schur complements of the
balanced weighted Laplacian matrix.

physical growth mechanism and unite it with biochemical growth factors.
Obtained results allowed formulating the general growth law which governs
growth and evolutional development of all living organisms, their organs and
systems. It was discovered that the growth cycle is predefined by the
distribution of nutritional resources between maintenance needs and biomass
production. This distribution is quantitatively defined by the growth ratio
parameter, which depends on the geometry of an organism, phase of growth and,
indirectly, organism's biochemical machinery. The amount of produced biomass,
in turn, defines the composition of biochemical reactions. Changing amount of
nutrients diverted to biomass production is what forces organisms to proceed
through the whole growth and replication cycle. The growth law can be
formulated as follows: the rate of growth is proportional to influx of
nutrients and growth ratio. Considering specific biochemical components of
different organisms, we find influxes of required nutrients and substitute them
into the growth equation; then, we compute growth curves for amoeba, wild type
fission yeast, fission yeast's mutant. In all cases, predicted growth curves
correspond very well to experimental data. Obtained results prove validity and
fundamental scientific value of the discovery.

they can be cast into series expansions with integer coefficients. We also give
several results showing that the unique analytical solution of Calabi-Yau ODEs,

improved substantially due to recent advances in asteroseismology. Thanks to
the unprecedented data quality obtained by space missions, particularly CoRoT
and Kepler, invaluable information is extracted from the high-precision stellar
oscillation frequencies, which provide very strong constraints on possible
stellar models for a given set of classical observations. In this work, we have
characterized two relatively faint stars, KIC10920273 and KIC11395018, using
oscillation data from Kepler photometry and atmospheric constraints from
ground-based spectroscopy. Both stars have very similar atmospheric properties;
however, using the individual frequencies extracted from the Kepler data, we
have determined quite distinct global properties, with increased precision
compared to that of earlier results. We found that both stars have left the
main sequence and characterized them as follows: KIC10920273 is a
one-solar-mass star (M=1.00 +/- 0.04 M_sun), but much older than our Sun
(t=7.12 +/- 0.47 Gyr), while KIC11395018 is significantly more massive than the
Sun (M=1.27 +/- 0.04 M_sun) with an age close to that of the Sun (t=4.57 +/-
0.23 Gyr). We confirm that the high lithium abundance reported for these stars
should not be considered to represent young ages, as we precisely determined
them to be evolved subgiants. We discuss the use of surface lithium abundance,
rotation and activity relations as potential age diagnostics.

and successfully applied in various applications. The main difficulty with this
approach is the computational cost of inference using the union of examples
from all tasks. Therefore sparse solutions, that avoid using the entire data
directly and instead use a set of informative ""representatives"" are desirable.
The paper investigates this problem for the grouped mixed-effect GP model where
each individual response is given by a fixed-effect, taken from one of a set of
unknown groups, plus a random individual effect function that captures
variations among individuals. Such models have been widely used in previous
work but no sparse solutions have been developed. The paper presents the first
sparse solution for such problems, showing how the sparse approximation can be
obtained by maximizing a variational lower bound on the marginal likelihood,
generalizing ideas from single-task Gaussian processes to handle the
mixed-effect model as well as grouping. Experiments using artificial and real
data validate the approach showing that it can recover the performance of
inference with the full sample, that it outperforms baseline methods, and that
it outperforms state of the art sparse solutions for other multi-task GP
formulations.

galaxy NGC 6240. In total 20 lines are detected, including CO J=4-3 through
J=13-12, 6 H2O rotational lines, and [CI] and [NII] fine-structure lines. The
CO to continuum luminosity ratio is 10 times higher in NGC 6240 than Mrk 231.
Although the CO ladders of NGC 6240 and Mrk 231 are very similar, UV and/or
X-ray irradiation are unlikely to be responsible for the excitation of the gas
in NGC 6240. We applied both C and J shock models to the H2 v=1-0 S(1) and
v=2-1 S(1) lines and the CO rotational ladder. The CO ladder is best reproduced
by a model with shock velocity v_s=10 km s^-1 and a pre-shock density n_H=5 *
10^4 cm^-3. We find that the solution best fitting the H2 lines is degenerate:
The shock velocities and number densities range between v_s = 17 - 47 km s^-1
and n_H=10^7 - 5 * 10^4 cm^-3, respectively. The H2 lines thus need a much more
powerful shock than the CO lines. We deduce that most of the gas is currently
moderately stirred up by slow (10 km s^-1) shocks while only a small fraction
(< 1 percent) of the ISM is exposed to the high velocity shocks. This implies
that the gas is rapidly loosing its highly turbulent motions. We argue that a
high CO line-to-continuum ratio is a key diagnostic for the presence of shocks.

active in stellar H-burning regions. In particular, low-energy nuclear
resonances in the $^{25}$Mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$Al reaction affect the production
of radioactive $^{26}$Al$^{gs}$ as well as the resulting Mg/Al abundance ratio.
Reliable estimations of these quantities require precise measurements of the
strengths of low-energy resonances. Based on a new experimental study performed
at LUNA, we provide revised rates of the $^{25}$Mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$Al$^{gs}$
and the $^{25}$Mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$Al$^{m}$ reactions with corresponding
uncertainties. In the temperature range 50 to 150 MK, the new recommended rate
of the $^{26}$Al$^{m}$ production is up to 5 times higher than previously
assumed. In addition, at T$=100$ MK, the revised total reaction rate is a
factor of 2 higher. Note that this is the range of temperature at which the
Mg-Al cycle operates in an H-burning zone. The effects of this revision are
discussed. Due to the significantly larger $^{25}$Mg(p,$\gamma$)$^{26}$Al$^{m}$
rate, the estimated production of $^{26}$Al$^{gs}$ in H-burning regions is less
efficient than previously obtained. As a result, the new rates should imply a
smaller contribution from Wolf-Rayet stars to the galactic $^{26}$Al budget.
Similarly, we show that the AGB extra-mixing scenario does not appear able to
explain the most extreme values of $^{26}$Al/$^{27}$Al, i.e. $>10^{-2}$, found
in some O-rich presolar grains. Finally, the substantial increase of the total
reaction rate makes the hypothesis of a self-pollution by massive AGBs a more
robust explanation for the Mg-Al anticorrelation observed in Globular-Cluster
stars.

entrance of sodium ions during the depolarization of the rising phase of the

the falling phase. Perfect metabolic efficiency with a minimum charge needed
for the change in voltage during the action potential would confine sodium
entry to the rising phase and potassium efflux to the falling phase. However,
because sodium channels remain open to a significant extent during the falling

work we investigate the impact of ion overlap on the number of the adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) molecules and energy cost required per action potential as a
function of the temperature in a Hodgkin-Huxley model. Based on a recent
approach to computing the energy cost of neuronal AP generation not based on
ion counting, we show that increased firing frequencies induced by higher
temperatures imply more efficient use of sodium entry, and then a decrease in
the metabolic energy cost required to restore the concentration gradients after
an action potential. Also, we determine values of sodium conductance at which
the hydrolysis efficiency presents a clear minimum.

unable to quickly adapt to the requirements of new sequencing or analysis

dramatically reduce the storage, computational and network burden of
collecting, analyzing, and archiving large sequencing datasets. For instance,
we show that spliced RNA-Seq alignments can be stored in less than 4% the size
of a BAM file with perfect data fidelity. Compared to the previous compression
state of the art, these methods reduce dataset size more than 20% when storing
gene expression and epigenetic datasets. The approaches have been integrated in

vector-like gauge theory (presumably QCD or techni-QCD) . The analysis at
intermediate energy scales is done by using an extended $\sigma$-model
lagrangian that includes two scalar and two pseudoscalar multiplets and
fulfills low-energy constraints for vector-like gauge theories. We elaborate on
a novel mechanism of parity breaking based on the interplay between lightest
and heavier meson condensates, which therefore cannot be realized in the
simplest $\sigma$ model. The results are relevant for an idealized homogeneous
and infinite nuclear (quark or techniquark) matter where the influence of
density can be examined with the help of a constant chemical potential. The
model is able to describe satisfactorily the first-order phase transition to
stable nuclear matter, and predicts a second-order phase transition to a state
where parity is spontaneously broken. We argue that the parity breaking
phenomenon is quite generic when a large enough chemical potential is present.
Current quark masses are explicitly taken into account in this work and shown
not to change the general conclusions.

individual galaxies responsible for its emission than has previously been
possible at this wavelength. At S_450>5mJy we resolve (7.4[+/-]0.7)x10^-2
MJy/sr of the CIB at 450um (equivalent to 16[+/-]7% of the absolute brightness
measured by COBE at this wavelength) into point sources. A further ~40% of the
CIB can be recovered through a statistical stack of 24um emitters in this
field, indicating that the majority (~60%) of the CIB at 450um is emitted by
galaxies with S_450>2mJy. The average redshift of 450um emitters identified
with an optical/near-infrared counterpart is estimated to be <z>=1.3, implying
that the galaxies in the sample are in the ultraluminous class (L_IR~1.1x10^12
L_sun). If the galaxies contributing to the statistical stack lie at similar
redshifts, then the majority of the CIB at 450um is emitted by galaxies in the

partition function of a thermal system expressed in a moving frame has a
natural implementation in the Euclidean path-integral formulation in terms of
shifted boundary conditions. Writing the Boltzmann factor as
$\exp[-L_0(H-i\xi.P)]$, the Poincare invariance underlying a relativistic
theory implies a dependence of the free-energy on $L_0$ and the shift $\xi$
only through the combination $\beta= L_0 \sqrt{1+\xi^2}$. This in turn implies
a set of Ward identities, some of which were previously derived by us, among
the correlators of the energy-momentum tensor. In the infinite-volume limit
they lead to relations among the cumulants of the total energy distribution and
those of the momentum, i.e. they connect the energy and the momentum
distributions in the canonical ensemble. In finite volume the Poincare symmetry
translates into exact relations among partition functions and correlation
functions defined with different sets of (generalized) periodic boundary
conditions. They have interesting applications in lattice field theory. In
particular, they offer Ward identities to renormalize non-perturbatively the
energy-momentum tensor and novel ways to compute thermodynamic potentials. At
fixed bare parameters they also provide a simple method to vary the temperature
in much smaller steps than with the standard procedure.

coordinate system to map signature relations remains an open research question.
We answer positively on these challenges by first proposing a kernel function
of spatial and spectral information in computing neighborhood graphs. Secondly,
the study exploits the force field interpretation from mechanics and devise a
unifying nonlinear graph embedding framework. The generalized framework leads
to novel unsupervised multidimensional artificial field embedding techniques
that rely on the simple additive assumption of pair-dependent attraction and
repulsion functions. The formulations capture long range and short range
distance related effects often associated with living organisms and help to
establish algorithmic properties that mimic mutual behavior for the purpose of
dimensionality reduction. The main benefits from the proposed models includes
the ability to preserve the local topology of data and produce quality
visualizations i.e. maintaining disjoint meaningful neighborhoods. As part of
evaluation, visualization, gradient field trajectories, and semisupervised

equations, that act as source terms of intensity which depend on the gradient
of the filter scale and which, if neglected, induce a systematic error
throughout the solution. Here the different noncommutation terms of the motion
equation are determined as functions of the \delta-gradient and of the
\delta-derivatives of the filtered variables. It is shown here that
approximated noncommutation terms of the fourth order of accuracy, with respect
to the filtering scale, can be obtained using series expansions in the filter
width of approximations based on finite differences and introducing successive
levels of filtering, which makes it suitable to use in conjunction with dynamic
or mixed subgrid models. The procedure operates in a way which is independent
of the type of filter in use and without increasing the differential order of
the equations, which, on the contrary, would require additional boundary
conditions. It is not necessary to introduce a mapping function of the
nonuniform grid in the physical domain into a uniform grid in an infinite
domain. A priori}tests on the turbulent channel flow (Re_\tau=180 and 590)
highlight the approximation capability of the present procedure. A numerical
example is given, which draws attention to the nonlocal effects on the solution
due to the lack of noncommutation terms in the motion equation and to the
efficiency of the present procedure in reducing the commutation error on the
solution.

statistical measures of dependence is a common step in analysis of climate
data. The term ""connectivity"" is used in the network context including the
study of complex coupled dynamical systems. The choice of dependence measure is
key for the results of the subsequent analysis and interpretation. The use of
linear Pearson's correlation coefficient is widespread and convenient. On the
other side, as the climate is widely acknowledged to be a nonlinear system,
nonlinear connectivity quantification methods, such as those based on
information-theoretical concepts, are increasingly used for this purpose.
  In this paper we outline an approach that enables well informed choice of
connectivity method for a given type of data, improving the subsequent
interpretation of the results. The presented multi-step approach includes
statistical testing, quantification of the specific non-linear contribution to
the interaction information, localization of nodes with strongest nonlinear
contribution and assessment of the role of specific temporal patterns,
including signal nonstationarities. In detail we study the consequences of the
choice of a general nonlinear connectivity measure, namely mutual information,
focusing on its relevance and potential alterations in the discovered
dependence structure.
  We document the method by applying it on monthly mean temperature data from
the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset as well as the ERA dataset. We have been able
to identify main sources of observed non-linearity in inter-node couplings.
Detailed analysis suggested an important role of several sources of
nonstationarity within the climate data. The quantitative role of genuine
nonlinear coupling at this scale has proven to be almost negligible, providing
quantitative support for the use of linear methods for this type of data.

leaving only residual unpredictable fluctuations. This classical view of
markets absorbing information and otherwise operating close to an equilibrium
is challenged by extreme price fluctuations, in particular since they occur far
more frequently than can be accounted for by external news. Here we show that
speculative markets which absorb mainly self-generated information can exhibit
both: evolution towards efficient equilibrium states as well as their
subsequent destabilization. This peculiar dynamics, a generic instability
arising from an adaptive control which annihilates predictable information, is
realized in a minimal agent-based market model where the impacts of agents'
strategies adapt according to their trading success. This adaptation implements
a learning rule for the market as a whole minimizing predictable price changes.
The model reproduces stylized statistical properties of price changes in
quantitative detail, including heavy tailed log return distributions and
volatility clusters. Our results demonstrate that the perpetual occurrence of
market instabilities can be a direct consequence of the very mechanisms that
lead to market efficiency.

we study here several reaction mechanisms separately but also their total
including interference. These mechanisms are: the recoil effect of the
core-target Coulomb potential which we distinguish from the direct
proton-target Coulomb potential and nuclear breakup, which consists of
stripping and diffraction. Direct Coulomb breakup typically gives cross
sections about an order of magnitude larger than the recoil term and the amount
of nuclear diffraction vs. Coulomb depends on the target. Thus for each
mechanism the absolute values of breakup cross sections and parallel momentum
distributions for 8B and 17F projectiles calculated on a light and a heavy
target in a range of intermediate incident energies (40-80A.MeV) are presented.
Furthermore we study in detail the interference among the two Coulomb effects

Lunin-Mathur symmetric orbifold technology for computing twist-nontwist
correlators developed in a companion work, we initiate a program to compute the
anomalous dimensions of low-lying string states in the D1-D5 superconformal
field theory. Our method entails finding four-point functions involving a
string operator O of interest and the deformation operator, taking coincidence
limits to identify which other operators mix with O, subtracting the identified
conformal family to isolate other contributions to the four-point function,
finding the mixing coefficients, and iterating. For the lowest-lying string
modes, this procedure should truncate in a finite number of steps. We check our
method by showing how the operator dual to the dilaton does not participate in
mixing that would change its conformal dimension, as expected. Next we complete
the first stage of the iteration procedure for a low-lying string state of the
form \partial X \partial X \bar\partial X \bar\partial X and find its mixing
coefficient. Our main qualitative result is evidence of operator mixing at
first order in the deformation parameter, which means that the string state
acquires an anomalous dimension. After diagonalization this will mean that
anomalous dimensions of some string states in the D1-D5 SCFT must decrease away

bring unique insights into a source which are not available from either channel

will have large sky error regions, on the order of 10-100 square degrees, which
can be made up of many disjoint patches. When searching such large areas there
is potential contamination by EM transients unrelated to the GW event.
Furthermore, the characteristics of possible EM counterparts to GW events are
also uncertain. It is therefore desirable to be able to assess the statistical
significance of a candidate EM counterpart, which can only be done by
performing background studies of large data sets. Current image processing
pipelines such as that used by ROTSE are not usually optimised for large-scale
processing. We have automated the ROTSE image analysis, and supplemented it
with a post-processing unit for candidate validation and classification. We
also propose a simple ad hoc statistic for ranking candidates as more likely to
be associated with the GW trigger. We demonstrate the performance of the
automated pipeline and ranking statistic using archival ROTSE data. EM
candidates from a randomly selected set of images are compared to a background
estimated from the analysis of 102 additional sets of archival images. The
pipeline's detection efficiency is computed empirically by re-analysis of the
images after adding simulated optical transients that follow typical light
curves for gamma-ray burst afterglows and kilonovae. We show that the automated
pipeline rejects most background events and is sensitive to simulated
transients to limiting magnitudes consistent with the limiting magnitude of the
images.

sparsity pattern of a sparse signal with multiple measurement data in
distributed networks. We assume that each node makes Compressive Sensing (CS)
based measurements via random projections regarding the same sparse signal. We
propose a distributed greedy algorithm based on Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
(OMP), in which the sparse support is estimated iteratively while fusing
indices estimated at distributed nodes. In the proposed distributed framework,
each node has to perform less number of iterations of OMP compared to the
sparsity index of the sparse signal. Thus, with each node having a very small
number of compressive measurements, a significant performance gain in support
recovery is achieved via the proposed collaborative scheme compared to the case
where each node estimates the sparsity pattern independently and then fusion is
performed to get a global estimate. We further extend the algorithm to estimate
the sparsity pattern in a binary hypothesis testing framework, where the
algorithm first detects the presence of a sparse signal collaborating among
nodes with a fewer number of iterations of OMP and then increases the number of
iterations to estimate the sparsity pattern only if the signal is detected.

southeast of the nucleus of M87, the central dominant galaxy of the Virgo
Cluster. We report the detection of far-infrared (FIR) [CII] line emission from
the nebulae using observations made with Herschel PACS. The infrared line
emission is extended and cospatial with optical H{\alpha}+[NII],
far-ultraviolet CIV lines, and soft X-ray emission. The filamentary nebulae
evidently contain multi-phase material spanning a temperature range of at least
5 orders of magnitude, from ~100 K to ~10^7 K. This material has most likely
been uplifted by the AGN from the center of M87. The thermal pressure of the
10^4 K phase appears to be significantly lower than that of the surrounding hot
intra-cluster medium (ICM) indicating the presence of additional turbulent and
magnetic pressure in the filaments. If the turbulence in the filaments is
subsonic then the magnetic field strength required to balance the pressure of
the surrounding ICM is B~30-70 {\mu}G. The spectral properties of the soft
X-ray emission from the filaments indicate that it is due to thermal plasma
with kT~0.5-1 keV, which is cooling by mixing with the cold gas and/or
radiatively. Charge exchange can be ruled out as a significant source of soft
X-rays. Both cooling and mixing scenarios predict gas with a range of
temperatures. This is at first glance inconsistent with the apparent lack of
X-ray emitting gas with kT<0.5 keV. However, we show that the missing very soft
X-ray emission could be absorbed by the cold gas in the filaments with an
integrated hydrogen column density of ~1.6x10^21 cm^-2, providing a natural
explanation for the apparent temperature floor to the X-ray emission at kT~0.5
keV. The FIR through ultra-violet line emission is most likely primarily
powered by the ICM particles penetrating the cold gas following a shearing
induced mixing process.

the assumption that the data is sampled from a manifold without boundaries and
singularities or that the functions of interest are evaluated away from such
points. At the same time, it can be argued that singularities and boundaries
are an important aspect of the geometry of realistic data.
  In this paper we consider the behavior of graph Laplacians at points at or
near boundaries and two main types of other singularities: intersections, where
different manifolds come together and sharp ""edges"", where a manifold sharply
changes direction. We show that the behavior of graph Laplacian near these
singularities is quite different from that in the interior of the manifolds. In
fact, a phenomenon somewhat reminiscent of the Gibbs effect in the analysis of
Fourier series, can be observed in the behavior of graph Laplacian near such
points. Unlike in the interior of the domain, where graph Laplacian converges
to the Laplace-Beltrami operator, near singularities graph Laplacian tends to a
first-order differential operator, which exhibits different scaling behavior as
a function of the kernel width. One important implication is that while points
near the singularities occupy only a small part of the total volume, the
difference in scaling results in a disproportionately large contribution to the
total behavior. Another significant finding is that while the scaling behavior
of the operator is the same near different types of singularities, they are
very distinct at a more refined level of analysis.
  We believe that a comprehensive understanding of these structures in addition
to the standard case of a smooth manifold can take us a long way toward better
methods for analysis of complex non-linear data and can lead to significant
progress in algorithm design.

simulations were carried out which established that the EM emission is produced
by the perpendicular component of the beam injection momentum. The beam has a
positive slope in the distribution function in perpendicular momentum phase
space, which is the characteristic feature of a cyclotron maser. The cyclotron
maser in the overdense plasma generates emission at the electron cyclotron
frequency. The frequencies of generated waves were too low to propagate away
from the injection region, hence the wavelet transform shows a pulsating wave
generation and decay process. The intensity pulsation frequency is twice the
relativistic cyclotron frequency. Eventually, a stable wave packet formed and
could mode couple on the density gradient to reach frequencies of the order of
the plasma frequency, that allowed for propagation. The emitted wave is likely
to be a z-mode wave. The total electromagnetic energy generated is of the order

clusters of individual masses $\sim 10^{4-6}~M_\odot$ in regions that are a few
hundred parsecs across. These cluster complexes interact dynamically, and their
coalescence is a candidate for the origin of some ultracompact dwarf galaxies
(UCDs). Individual clusters with short relaxation times are candidates for the
production of intermediate-mass black holes of a few hundred solar masses, via
runaway stellar collisions prior to the first supernovae in a cluster. It is
therefore possible that a cluster complex hosts multiple intermediate-mass
black holes that may be ejected from their individual clusters due to mergers
or binary processes, but bound to the complex as a whole. Here we explore the
dynamical interaction between initially free-flying massive black holes and
clusters in an evolving cluster complex. We find that, after hitting some
clusters, it is plausible that the massive black hole will be captured in an
ultracompact dwarf forming near the center of the complex. In the process, the
hole typically triggers electromagnetic flares via stellar disruptions, and is
also likely to be a prominent source of gravitational radiation for the
advanced ground-based detectors LIGO and VIRGO. We also discuss other
implications of this scenario, notably that the central black hole could be
considerably larger than expected in other formation scenarios for ultracompact
dwarfs.

a resolved gamma-ray feature close to the galactic center which is consistent
with monochromatic photons at an energy of about 130 GeV. If interpreted in
terms of dark matter (DM) annihilating into \gamma\gamma (\gamma Z, \gamma h),
this would correspond to a DM particle mass of roughly 130 GeV (145 GeV, 155
GeV). The rate for these loop-suppressed processes, however, is larger than
typically expected for thermally produced DM. Correspondingly, one would
generically expect even larger tree level production rates of standard model
fermions or gauge bosons. Here, we quantify this expectation in a rather
model-independent way by relating the tree level and loop amplitudes with the
help of the optical theorem. As an application, we consider bounds from
continuum gamma rays, radio and antiproton data on the tree level amplitudes
and translate them into constraints on the loop amplitudes. We find that,
independently of the DM production mechanism, any DM model aiming at explaining
the line signal in terms of charged standard model particles running in the
loop is in rather strong tension with at least one of these constraints, with
the exception of loops dominated by top quarks. We stress that attempts to
explain the 130 GeV feature with internal bremsstrahlung do not suffer from
such difficulties.

extract physics from solar neutrino flux measurements while minimizing the
consequences of SSM uncertainties, by studying flux ratios with appropriate
power-law weightings tuned to cancel this $T_c$ dependence. We re-examine an
idea for constraining the primordial C+N content of the solar core from a ratio
of CN-cycle $^{15}$O to pp-chain $^8$B neutrino fluxes, showing that nonnuclear
SSM uncertainties in the ratio are small and effectively governed by a single
parameter, the diffusion coefficient. We point out that measurements of both
CN-I cycle neutrino branches -- $^{15}$O and $^{13}$N $\beta$-decay -- could in
principle lead to separate determinations of the core C and N abundances, due
to out-of-equilibrium CN-cycle burning in the cooler outer layers of the solar
core. Finally, we show that the strategy of constructing ""minimum uncertainty""
neutrino flux ratios can also test other properties of the SSM. In particular,
we demonstrate that a weighted ratio of $^7$Be and $^8$B fluxes constrains a
product of S-factors to the same precision currently possible with laboratory
data.

Spectrograph (NIFS) and the ALTAIR adaptive-optics system on the Gemini North
telescope. The circum-nuclear disc in the inner R~50 pc of NGC 1275 is seen in
both the H2 and [FeII] lines. The disc is interpreted as the outer part of a
collisionally-excited turbulent accretion disc. The kinematic major axis of the
disc at a position angle of 68 deg is oriented perpendicular to the radio jet.
A streamer-like feature to the south-west of the disc, detected in H2 but not
in [FeII], is discussed as one of possibly several molecular streamers,
presumably falling into the nuclear region. Indications of an ionization
structure within the disc are deduced from the HeI and Br gamma emission lines,
which may partially originate from the inner portions of the accretion disc.
The kinematics of these two lines agrees with the signature of the
circum-nuclear disc, but both lines display a larger central velocity
dispersion than the H2 line. The rovibrational H2 transitions from the core of
NGC 1275 are indicative of thermal excitation caused by shocks and agree with
excitation temperatures of ~1360 and ~4290 K for the lower- and higher-energy
H2 transitions, respectively. The data suggest X-ray heating as the dominant
excitation mechanism of [FeII] emission in the core, while fast shocks are a
possible alternative. The [FeII] lines indicate an electron density of ~4000
cm^{-3}. The H2 disc is modelled using simulated NIFS data cubes of H2 emission
from inclined discs in Keplerian rotation around a central mass. Assuming a
disc inclination of 45 deg +/- 10 deg, the best-fitting models imply a central

shaping their present properties. They cause angular momentum to be
redistributed within the galaxy, emitted mainly from (near-)resonant material
at the inner Lindblad resonance of the bar, and absorbed mainly by
(near-)resonant material in the spheroid (i.e., the halo and, whenever
relevant, the bulge) and in the outer disk. Spheroids delay and slow down the
initial growth of the bar they host, but, at the later stages of the evolution,
they strengthen the bar by absorbing angular momentum. Increased velocity
dispersion in the (near-)resonant regions delays bar formation and leads to
less strong bars. When bars form they are vertically thin, but soon their inner
parts puff up and form what is commonly known as the boxy/peanut bulge. This
gives a complex and interesting shape to the bar which explains a number of
observations and also argues that the COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar in our
Galaxy are, respectively, the thin and the thick part of a single bar. The
value of the bar pattern speed may be set by optimising the balance between
emitters and absorbers, so that a maximum amount of angular momentum is
redistributed. As they evolve, bars grow stronger and rotate slower. Bars also
redistribute matter within the galaxy, create a disky bulge (pseudo-bulge),
increase the disk scale-length and extent and drive substructures such as
spirals and rings. They also affect the shape of the inner part of the

galaxies with gas and/or a triaxial halo. We find that both the relative gas
fraction and the halo shape play a major role in the formation and evolution of
the bar. In gas-rich simulations, the disc stays near-axisymmetric much longer
than in gas-poor ones, and, when the bar starts growing, it does so at a much
slower rate. Due to these two effects combined, large-scale bars form much
later in gas-rich than in gas-poor discs. This can explain the observation that
bars are in place earlier in massive red disc galaxies than in blue spirals. We
also find that the morphological characteristics in the bar region are strongly
influenced by the gas fraction. In particular, the bar at the end of the
simulation is much weaker in gas-rich cases. In no case did we witness bar
destruction.
  Halo triaxiality has a dual influence on bar strength. In the very early
stages of the simulation it induces bar formation to start earlier. On the
other hand, during the later, secular evolution phase, triaxial haloes lead to
considerably less increase of the bar strength than spherical ones. The shape
of the halo evolves considerably with time. The inner halo parts may become
more elongated, or more spherical, depending on the bar strength. The main body
of initially triaxial haloes evolves towards sphericity, but in initially
strongly triaxial cases it stops well short of becoming spherical. Part of the
angular momentum absorbed by the halo generates considerable rotation of the
halo particles that stay located relatively near the disc for long periods of
time. Another part generates halo bulk rotation, which, contrary to that of the
bar, increases with time but stays small.

rest frame, which aberrates and Doppler shifts incoming photons measured by
current CMB experiments, has been shown to produce mode-mixing in the multipole
space temperature coefficients. However, multipole space determinations are
subject to many difficulties, and a real-space analysis can provide a
straightforward alternative. In this work we describe a numerical method for
removing Lorentz- boost effects from real-space temperature maps. We show that
to deboost a map so that one can accurately extract the temperature power
spectrum requires calculating the boost kernel at a finer pixelization than one
might naively expect. In idealized cases that allow for easy comparison to
analytic results, we have confirmed that there is indeed mode mixing among the
spherical harmonic coefficients of the temperature. We find that using a boost
kernel calculated at Nside=8192 leads to a 1% bias in the binned boosted power
spectrum at l~2000, while individual Cls exhibit ~5% fluctuations around the
binned average. However, this bias is dominated by pixelization effects and not
the aberration and Doppler shift of CMB photons that causes the fluctuations.
Performing analysis on maps with galactic cuts does not induce any additional
error in the boosted, binned power spectra over the full sky analysis. For
multipoles that are free of resolution effects, there is no detectable
deviation between the binned boosted and unboosted spectra. This result arises

Our construction allows us to rephrase questions about information-loss and the

correlators. It suggests that to precisely identify black-hole microstates, the
observer would need to conduct measurements to an accuracy of e^{-S_{BH}}. This
appears to be inconsistent with the fuzzball proposal, and other recent
proposals in which pure states in the ensemble of the black hole are
represented by macroscopically distinct geometries. Furthermore, our
description of the black hole interior in terms of CFT operators provides a
natural realization of black hole complementarity and a method of preserving

are also considered, with comparisons with previous measurements. Some
departures in the shapes of the ground calibration responsivities are found at
the start of the mission. These shapes do not change significantly over time,
with the exception of the shorter wavelengths of the EIS short-wavelength (SW)
channel, which shows some degradation. The sensitivity of the SW channel at
longer wavelengths does not show significant degradation, while that of the
long-wavelength (LW) channel shows a significant degradation with time. By the
beginning of 2010 the responsivity of the LW channel was already a factor of
two or more lower than the values measured on the ground. A first-order
correction is proposed. With this correction, the main ratios of lines in the
two channels become constant to within a relative 20%, and the He II 256 A
radiances over the quiet Sun also become constant over time. This correction
removes long-standing discrepancies for a number of lines and ions, in

spatially-continuous models in which molecules move by Brownian motion and
react by one of several mechanisms when sufficiently close. In the limit that
the lattice spacing approaches zero, in two or more dimensions, the RDME has
been shown to lose bimolecular reactions. The RDME is therefore not a
convergent approximation to any spatially-continuous model that incorporates
bimolecular reactions. In this work we derive a new convergent RDME (CRDME) by
finite volume discretization of a spatially-continuous stochastic

convergence of reaction time statistics associated with the CRDME. For
sufficiently large lattice spacings or slow bimolecular reaction rates, we also
show the reaction time statistics of the CRDME may be approximated by those

expanders.
  Our study suggests natural generalizations of many concepts from graph
theory, such as amenability, recurrence/transience, and bipartiteness. We
present some observations regarding these ideas, and several open questions.

creation (due to their magnetic moments) in strong inhomogeneous magnetic
fields is considered. It is demonstrated that quantization in terms of neutral
particles and antiparticles is possible in terms of the states with
well-defined spin polarization. Such states are localizable and can form wave
packets in a given asymptotic region. In this case, the problem can be
technically reduced to the problem of charged-particle creation by an electric
step. In particular, the relation to the Schwinger method of an effective
action is established. As an example, we calculate neutral fermion creation
from the vacuum by a linearly growing magnetic field. We show that the total
number and the vacuum-to-vacuum transition probability of created pairs depend
only on the gradient of the magnetic field, but not on its strength, and this
fact does not depend on the spacetime dimension. We show that the created flux
aimed in one of the directions is formed from fluxes of particles and
antiparticles of equal intensity and with the same magnetic moments parallel to
the external field. In such a flux, particle and antiparticle velocities that
are perpendicular to the plane of the magnetic moment and flux direction are
essentially depressed. The creation of neutral fermions with anomalous magnetic
moments leads to a smoothing of the initial magnetic field, which in turn
prevents appearance of superstrong constant magnetic fields. Our estimations
show that the vacuum instability with respect to the creation of neutrinos and
even neutrons in strong magnetic fields of the magnetars and fields generated
during a supernova explosion has to be taken into account in the astrophysics.
In particular, it may be of significance for dark matter studies.

detected as a bright source of a continuum radiation. We do not detect however
any diffuse X-ray emission from the known radio lobes, with the provided upper
limit only marginally consistent with the previously claimed ASCA flux. Two
scenarios that connect the X-ray and gamma-ray properties are considered. In
the first one, we assume that the diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission component
is not significantly below the derived Suzaku upper limit. In this case,
modeling the inverse-Compton emission shows that the observed gamma-ray flux of
the source may in principle be produced within the lobes. This association
would imply that efficient in-situ acceleration of the radiating electrons is
occurring and that the lobes are dominated by the pressure from the
relativistic particles. In the second scenario, with the diffuse X-ray emission
well below the Suzaku upper limits, the lobes in the system are instead
dominated by the magnetic pressure. In this case, the observed gamma-ray flux
is not likely to be produced within the lobes, but instead within the nuclear
parts of the jet. By means of synchrotron self-Compton modeling we show that
this possibility could be consistent with the broad-band data collected for the
unresolved core of Centaurus B, including the newly derived Suzaku spectrum.

that of the bulk. Our simulations show that the interfacial strength saturates
at the bulk shear strength much before polymers diffuse by their radius of

from chain pullout at the interface to chain scission as in the bulk. Formation
of sufficient entanglements across the interface, which we track using a

and ([3.6]-[24]) colors to K_s=18.4 and [3.6]=17.5, respectively. Star-forming
and passive EROs in magnitude limited samples have different clustering
properties and host dark halo masses, and cannot be simply understood as a
single population. Based on the clustering, we find that bright passive EROs
are the likely progenitors of >4L^* elliptical galaxies. Bright EROs with
ongoing star formation were found to occupy denser environments than
star-forming galaxies in the local Universe, making these the likely
progenitors of >L^* local ellipticals. This suggests that the progenitors of
massive >4L^* local ellipticals had stopped forming stars by z>1.2, but that
the progenitors of less massive ellipticals (down to L^*) can still show
significant star formation at this epoch.

density of solid materials in the inner disk, significant amount of small
planetesimals must exist in the inner zone when embryos were forming outside
this CSMA. So embryos migration induced by the planetesimal swarm is possible
after the gas disk depletion. Through numerical simulations, we found (i) the
scattering-driven inward migration of embryos is robust, planets can form in
the habitable zone if we adopt a mass distribution of MMSN-like disk; (ii) the
total mass of the planetesimals in the inner region and continuous
embryo-embryo scattering are two key factors that cause significant embryo

completed in September 2012 doubles the earlier exposures with WFC3/IR in this

distant galaxies. Combined with additional imaging in the F140W filter, the
fidelity of high redshift candidates is greatly improved. Using spectral energy
distribution fitting techniques on objects selected from a deep multi-band
near-infrared stack we find 7 promising z>8.5 candidates. As none of the
previously claimed UDF candidates with 8.5<z<10 is confirmed by our deeper
multi-band imaging, our campaign has transformed the measured abundance of
galaxies in this redshift range. Although we recover the candidate
UDFj-39546284 (previously proposed at z=10.3), it is undetected in the newly
added F140W image, implying it lies at z=11.9 or is an intense emission line
galaxy at z~2.4. Although no physically-plausible model can explain the
required line intensity given the lack of Lyman alpha or broad-band UV signal,
without an infrared spectrum we cannot rule out an exotic interloper.

that continues the smooth decline observed over 6 < z < 8. Such continuity has
important implications for models of cosmic reionization and future searches

even for circular, aligned, and synchronized systems. We calculate the
magnitude and frequencies of three-body tidal forcing on the central primary

tidal dissipation may be greatly enhanced by resonance locking. We then compare
our theory to observations of HD 181068, which is a hierarchical triply

frequencies in HD 181068 can be naturally explained by three-body tidal

The three cases with different initial strengths of magnetic field and rotation

rotating core; 3. very strongly magnetized non-rotating core. In each case,
both an ideal-MHD model and resistive-MHD models are computed. As a result of
computations, each model shows a matter eruption helped by a magnetic
acceleration (and also by a centrifugal acceleration in the rotating cases). We
found that a resistivity attenuates the explosion in case~1 and 2, while it
enhances the explosion in case~3. We also found that in the rotating cases,
main mechanisms for the amplification of a magnetic field in the post-bounce
phase are an outward advection of magnetic field and a winding of poloidal
magnetic field-lines by differential rotation, which are somewhat dampened down
with the presence of a resistivity. Although the magnetorotational instability
seems to occur in the rotating models, it will play only a minor role in a
magnetic field amplification. Another impact of resistivity is that on the
aspect ratio. In the rotating cases, a large aspect ratio of the ejected
matters, $> 2.5$, attained in a ideal-MHD model is reduced to some extent in a
resistive model. These results indicate that a resistivity possibly plays an

{\theta}_12. Both of these determinations will be more reliable if data from
identical detectors at distinct baselines are combined. While interference
effects can be eliminated by choosing detector sites orthogonal to the reactor
arrays, one of the greatest challenges facing a determination of the mass
hierarchy is the detector's unknown energy response. By comparing peaks at
similar energies at two identical detectors at distinct baselines, one
eliminates any correlated dependence upon a monotonic energy response. In
addition, a second detector leads to new hierarchy-dependent observables, such
as the ratio of the locations of the maxima of the Fourier cosine transforms.
Simultaneously, one may determine the hierarchy by comparing the {\chi}^2 best
fits of {\Delta}M^2_32 at the two detectors using the spectra associated to
both hierarchies. A second detector at a distinct baseline also breaks the
degeneracy between {\theta}_12 and the background neutrino flux from, for
example, distant reactors and increases the effective target mass, which is
limited by current designs to about 20 kton/detector.

constructed on the basis of two-body density correlations. However, we have
recently shown that many-body correlations, in particular bond orientational
correlations, play a key role in both the glass transition and the
crystallization transition. Here we show, with numerical simulations of
supercooled polydisperse hard spheres systems, that the lengthscale associated
with any two-point spatial correlation function does not increase toward the
glass transition. A growing lengthscale is instead revealed by considering
many-body correlation functions, such as correlators of orientational order,
which follows the lengthscale of the dynamic heterogeneities. Despite the
growing of crystal-like bond orientational order, we reveal that the stability
against crystallization with increasing polydispersity is due to an increasing
population of icosahedral arrangements of particles. Our results suggest that,
for this type of systems, many-body correlations are a manifestation of the
link between the vitrification and the crystallization phenomena. Whether a
system is vitrified or crystallized can be controlled by the degree of
frustration against crystallization, polydispersity in this case.

than the M_BH-M_bulge one. We show that this behavior stems from a combination
of two natural factors, (i) that CGs experience more mergers involving
spheroidal galaxies and their MBHs, and (ii) that such mergers are
preferentially gas-poor. We use a combination of analytical and semi-analytical
models to investigate the MBH-galaxy co-evolution in different environments and
find that the combination of these two factors explains the trends observed in
current data-sets.

the map is a mosaic of 85 pointings covering an approximate area of 6'.5 x 2'.0

an H_2 mass between 0.3-5.7 Mo and a projected source size between 1400-8200
AU. All the detected sources are on the filamentary main ridge n_H2>10^6
cm^-3), and analysis based on the Jeans theorem suggests that they are most
likely gravitationally unstable. Comparison of multi-wavelength data sets
indicates that of the continuum sources, 6/12 (50 %) are associated with
molecular outflows, 8/12 (67 %) are associated with infrared sources, and 3/12
(25 %) are associated with ionized jets. The evolutionary status of these
sources ranges from prestellar cores to protostar phase, confirming that OMC-3
is an active region with ongoing embedded star-formation. We detect
quasi-periodical separations between the OMC-3 sources of ~17""/0.035 pc. This
spatial distribution is part of a large hierarchical structure, that also
includes fragmentation scales of GMC (~35 pc), large-scale clumps (~1.3 pc),
and small-scale clumps (~0.3 pc), suggesting that hierarchical fragmentation
operates within the Orion A molecular cloud. The fragmentation spacings are
roughly consistent with the thermal fragmentation length in large-scale clumps,
while for small-scale cores it is smaller than the local fragmentation length.
These smaller spacings observed with the SMA can be explained by either a
helical magnetic field, cloud rotation, or/and global filament collapse.
Finally, possible evidence for sequential fragmentation is suggested in the
northern part of the OMC-3 filament.

[Fe/H]=-1.9 to +0.6; (ii) The dip in the MDF around solar metallicity that was
apparent in our previous analysis of a smaller sample (26 microlensed stars) is
no longer evident; instead it has a complex structure and indications of
multiple components are starting to emerge. [ABRIDGED]; (iii) The stars with
[Fe/H]<-0.1 are old with ages between 10 and 12 Gyr; (iv) The metal-rich stars
with [Fe/H]>-0.1 show a wide variety of ages, ranging from 2 to 12 Gyr with a
distribution that has a dominant peak around 4-5 Gyr and a tail towards higher
ages; (v) There are indications in the [alpha/Fe] - [Fe/H] that the ""knee""
occurs around [Fe/H] = -0.3 to -0.2, which is a slightly higher metallicity as
compared to the ""knee"" for the local thick disk. This suggests that the
chemical enrichment of the metal-poor bulge has been somewhat faster than what
is observed for the local thick disk. The results from the microlensed bulge
dwarf stars in combination with other findings in the literature, in particular
the evidence that the bulge has cylindrical rotation, indicate that the Milky
Way could be an almost pure disk galaxy. The bulge would then just be a
conglomerate of the other Galactic stellar populations (thin disk, thick disk,
halo, and ...?), residing together in the central parts of the Galaxy,
influenced by the Galactic bar.

three-dimensional cosmological simulations. We critically examine how
assumptions and approximations made in calculating radiative cooling rates
affect the dynamics of the collapsing gas clouds. We consider two important
molecular hydrogen cooling processes that operate in a dense primordial gas;
H_2 line cooling and continuum cooling by H_2 collision-induced emission. To
calculate the optically thick cooling rates, we follow the Sobolev method for
the former, whereas we perform ray-tracing for the latter. We also run the same
set of simulations using simplified fitting functions for the net cooling
rates. We compare the simulation results in detail. We show that the time- and
direction-dependence of hydrodynamic quantities such as gas temperature and
local velocity gradients significantly affects the optically thick cooling
rates. Gravitational collapse of the cloud core is accelerated when the cooling
rates are calculated by using the fitting functions. The structure and
evolution of the central pre-stellar disk are also affected. We conclude that
physically motivated implementations of radiative transfer are necessary to
follow accurately the thermal and chemical evolution of a primordial gas to
high densities.

42 H II regions using the N II and O II optical recombination lines (ORLs). New
effective recombination coefficients for the N II and O II optical
recombination spectra are used. These data were calculated under the
intermediate coupling scheme for a number of electron temperature (Te) and
density (Ne) cases. We used a new method to determine the Te and Ne for the
nebular sample, combining the ORLs with the most reliable measurements for each
ion and the predicted intensities that are based on the new atomic data.
Uncertainties of the derived Te and Ne are estimated for each object. The
diagnostic results from heavy element ORLs show reasonable agreement with
previous calculations in the literature. We compare the electron temperatures
derived from the N II and O II ORLs, Te(ORLs), and those from the collisionally
excited lines (CELs), Te(CELs), as well as the hydrogen Balmer jump, Te(H I
BJ), especially for the PNe with large abundance discrepancies. Temperatures
from He I recombination lines, Te(He I), are also used for comparison if
available. For all the objects included in our sample, Te(ORLs) are lower than
Te(H I BJ), which are in turn systematically lower than Te(CELs). Nebulae with
Te(He I) available show the relation Te(ORLs) < Te(He I) < Te(H I BJ) <
Te(CELs), which is consistent with predictions from the bi-abundance nebular
model postulated by Liu et al. (2000).

the AB and AA interactions, r. Our results show that, similarly to what happens
for related off-lattice and two-dimensional lattice models, the liquid-vapor
phase equilibria exhibits reentrant behavior for some values of the interaction
parameters. However, for the model studied here the liquid-vapor phase
equilibria occurs for values of r lower than 1/3, a threshold value which was
previously thought to be universal for 2AnB models. In addition, the theory
predicts that below r = 1/3 (and above a new condensation threshold which is <
1/3) the reentrant liquid-vapor equilibria is so extreme that it exhibits a
closed loop with a lower critical point, a very unusual behavior in
single-component systems. An order-disorder transition is also observed at
higher densities than the liquid-vapor equilibria, which shows that the
liquid-vapor reentrancy occurs in an equilibrium region of the phase diagram.

two important features of them: (i) For the large linear system $Ax=b$ with $A$
irregular sparse, i.e., with $A$ having $s$ relatively dense columns, SPAI may
be very costly to implement, and the resulting sparse approximate inverses may
be ineffective for preconditioning. PSAI can be effective for preconditioning
but may require excessive storage and be unacceptably time consuming; (ii) the
situation is improved drastically when $A$ is regular sparse, that is, all of
its columns are sparse. In this case, both SPAI and PSAI are efficient.
Moreover, SPAI and, especially, PSAI are more likely to construct effective
preconditioners. Motivated by these features, we propose an approach to making
SPAI and PSAI more practical for $Ax=b$ with $A$ irregular sparse. We first
split $A$ into a regular sparse $\tilde A$ and a matrix of low rank $s$. Then
exploiting the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury formula, we transform $Ax=b$ into
$s+1$ new linear systems with the same coefficient matrix $\tilde A$, use SPAI
and PSAI to compute sparse approximate inverses of $\tilde A$ efficiently and
apply Krylov iterative methods to solve the preconditioned linear systems.
Theoretically, we consider the non-singularity and conditioning of $\tilde A$
obtained from some important classes of matrices. We show how to recover an
approximate solution of $Ax=b$ from those of the $s+1$ new systems and how to
design reliable stopping criteria for the $s+1$ systems to guarantee that the
approximate solution of $Ax=b$ satisfies a desired accuracy. Given the fact
that irregular sparse linear systems are common in applications, this approach
widely extends the practicability of SPAI and PSAI. Numerical results
demonstrate the considerable superiority of our approach to the direct
application of SPAI and PSAI to $Ax=b$.

mobile devices from the constraints imposed by finite battery capacities.
Integrating MPT with wireless communications to support simultaneous
information and power transfer (SIPT) allows the same spectrum to be used for
dual purposes without compromising the quality of service. A novel approach is
presented in this paper for realizing SIPT in a broadband system where
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing and transmit beamforming are
deployed to create a set of parallel sub-channels for SIPT, which simplifies
resource allocation. Supported by a proposed reconfigurable mobile
architecture, different system configurations are considered by combining
single-user/multiuser systems, downlink/uplink information transfer, and
variable/fixed coding rates. Optimizing the power control for these
configurations results in a new class of multiuser power-control problems
featuring circuit-power constraints, specifying that the transferred power must
be sufficiently large to support the operation of the receiver circuitry.
Solving these problems gives a set of power-control algorithms that exploit
channel diversity in frequency for simultaneously enhancing the throughput and
the MPT efficiency. For the system configurations with variable coding rates,
the algorithms are variants of water-filling that account for the circuit-power
constraints. The optimal algorithms for those configurations with fixed coding
rates are shown to sequentially allocate mobiles their required power for
decoding in the ascending order until the entire budgeted power is spent. The
required power for a mobile is derived as simple functions of the minimum
signal-to-noise ratio for correct decoding, the circuit power and sub-channel
gains.

The RPA naturally accounts for long-range dispersive forces without
compromising accuracy for short range interactions making the RPA superior to
semi-local and hybrid functionals in systems dominated by weak van der Waals or
mixed covalent-dispersive interactions. In this work we present plane
wave-based RPA calculations for a broad collection of systems with bond types
ranging from strong covalent to van der Waals. Our main result is the RPA
potential energy surfaces of graphene on the Cu(111), Ni(111), Co(0001),
Pd(111), Pt(111), Ag(111), Au(111), and Al(111) metal surfaces, which represent
archetypical examples of metal-organic interfaces. Comparison with semi-local
density approximations and a non-local van der Waals functional show that only
the RPA captures both the weak covalent and dispersive forces which are equally
important for these systems. We benchmark our implementation in the GPAW
electronic structure code by calculating cohesive energies of graphite and a
range of covalently bonded solids and molecules as well as the dissociation
curves of H2 and H2+. These results show that RPA with orbitals from the local
density approximation suffers from delocalization errors and systematically
underestimates covalent bond energies yielding similar or lower accuracy than
the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional for molecules and solids,

realistic values of the parameters {\DH} the indirect exchange integrals show a
long-range, oscillating (RKKY-like) behavior, if the V-term is neglected,
probably leading to spin-glass behavior rather than magnetic order. But by
including a V-term of a realistic magnitude the exchange couplings become short

This leads to unphysical structures in the energy dependence of the computed

Processes, for which it is known that there exists a stationary optimal policy.
Using Value and Policy Iteration with some error $\epsilon$ at each iteration,
it is well-known that one can compute stationary policies that are
$\frac{2\gamma}{(1-\gamma)^2}\epsilon$-optimal. After arguing that this
guarantee is tight, we develop variations of Value and Policy Iteration for
computing non-stationary policies that can be up to
$\frac{2\gamma}{1-\gamma}\epsilon$-optimal, which constitutes a significant
improvement in the usual situation when $\gamma$ is close to 1. Surprisingly,
this shows that the problem of ""computing near-optimal non-stationary policies""
is much simpler than that of ""computing near-optimal stationary policies"".

phistar observable is presented. This variable probes the same physics as the
Z/gamma* boson transverse momentum with a better experimental resolution. The
Z/gamma*->e+e- and Z/gamma*->mu+mu- decays produced in proton--proton
collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of sqrt(s) = 7 TeV are used. The data
were collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC and correspond to an
integrated luminosity of 4.6 fb-1. Normalised differential cross sections as a
function of phistar are measured separately for electron and muon decay
channels. These channels are then combined for improved accuracy. The cross
section is also measured double differentially as a function of phistar for
three independent bins of the Z boson rapidity. The results are compared to QCD
calculations and to predictions from different Monte Carlo event generators.
The data are reasonably well described, in all measured Z boson rapidity
regions, by resummed QCD predictions combined with fixed-order perturbative QCD
calculations. Some of the Monte Carlo event generators are also able to
describe the data. The measurement precision is typically better by one order
of magnitude than present theoretical uncertainties.

distribution of valence neutron largely weakens the strength of correlation
function. The size of emission source is extracted by fitting correlation
function using Gaussian source method. The emission source size as well as the
size of final state phase space is larger for projectiles sampling from more

describe the modification of the color correlation length with energy as a
compression process for which non equilibrium thermodynamic properties are
applicable. We derive an expression of the dynamical entropy in terms of the
rapidity evolution of the unintegrated gluon distributions in the colliding

this approach to the initial pre-equilibrium (glasma) state of an heavy-ion
collision. It allows for a definition of the initial entropy before the
evolution towards the hydrodynamic regime as a function of the glasma
correlation length and an overlap parameter characterizing the low-momentum
spectrum of the glasma state. This initial entropy, by extension to the N=4 SYM
theory, is then matched as the key input parameter to the strong coupling

a linear increase with the accumulated strain, then a maximum ('stress
overshoot') for strain values around 5%, before finally approaching the
stationary value, which makes up the flow curve. These phenomena arise in
well-equilibrated systems and for homogeneous flows, indicating that they are
generic phenomena of the shear-driven transient structural relaxation.
Microscopic mode coupling theory (generalized to flowing states by integration
through the transients) derives them from the transient stress correlations,
which first exhibit a plateau (corresponding to the solid-like elastic shear
modulus) at intermediate times, and then negative stress correlations during
the final decay. We introduce and validate a schematic model within mode
coupling theory which captures all of these phenomena and handily can be used
to jointly analyse linear and large-amplitude moduli, flow curves, and
stress-strain curves. This is done by introducing a new strain- and

annihilation to the extra-galactic diffuse gamma-ray background can be detected

self-annihilation cross section, the sensitivity of CTA corresponds to values
below the thermal freeze-out expectation <sigma v> = 3 x 10-26 cm3s-1 for dark

powerful tools for identifying tidal dwarfs at moderate to large redshifts to

coincident M2- and M5-branes. We begin with a review of the BLG and ABJM models
of multiple M2-branes and our focus will be on their formulation in terms of
3-algebras. We then examine the coupling of multiple M2-branes to the
background 3-form and 6-form gauge fields of eleven-dimensional supergravity.
In particular we show in detail how a natural generalisation of the Myers
flux-terms, along with the resulting curvature of the background metric, leads
to mass terms in the effective field theory. Working to lowest nontrivial order
in fermions, we demonstrate the supersymmetric invariance of the
four-derivative order corrected Lagrangian of the Euclidean BLG theory and
determine the theory's higher derivative corrected supersymmetry
transformations. The supersymmetry algebra is also shown to close on the scalar
and gauge fields. We also consider periodic arrays of M2-branes in the ABJM
model in the spirit of a circle compactification to D2-branes in type IIA
string theory. The result is a curious formulation of three-dimensional
maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Upon further T-duality on a
transverse torus we obtain a non-manifest-Lorentz-invariant description of
five-dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills which can be viewed as an
M-theory description of M5-branes on $\mathbb{T}^3$. After reviewing work to
describe multiple M5-branes using 3-algebras we show how the resulting novel
system of equations reduces to one-dimensional motion on instanton moduli
space. Quantisation leads to the previous light-cone proposal of the (2,0)
theory, generalised to include a potential that arises on the Coulomb branch as
well as couplings to background gauge and self-dual 2-form fields.

pseudopotential multiphase lattice Boltzmann (LB) model has attracted
significant attention since its emergence. In this work, we aim to extend the
pseudopotential LB model to simulate multiphase flows at large density ratio
and relatively high Reynolds number. First, based on our recent work [Li et
al., Phys. Rev. E. 86, 016709 (2012)], an improved forcing scheme is proposed
for the multiple-relaxation-time pseudopotential LB model in order to achieve
thermodynamic consistency and large density ratio in the model. Next, through
investigating the effects of the parameter a in the Carnahan-Starling equation
of state, we find that the interface thickness is approximately proportional to
1/sqrt(a). Using a smaller a will lead to a wider interface thickness, which
can reduce the spurious currents and enhance the numerical stability of the
pseudopotential model at large density ratio. Furthermore, it is found that a
lower liquid viscosity can be gained in the pseudopotential model by increasing
the kinematic viscosity ratio between the vapor and liquid phases. The improved
pseudopotential LB model is numerically validated via the simulations of
stationary droplet and droplet oscillation. Using the improved model as well as
the above treatments, numerical simulations of droplet splashing on a thin
liquid film are conducted at a density ratio in excess of 500 with Reynolds
numbers ranging from 40 to 1000. The dynamics of droplet splashing is correctly
reproduced and the predicted spread radius is found to obey the power law
reported in the literature.

approaches to the dynamics, with specific attention drawn to the dynamics of
the Ginzburg-Landau order parameters of the Fermi and composite Bose fields, as
well as on the microscopic dynamics of the quantum degrees of freedom. The two
approaches are valid approximations in two different time scales of the ensuing
dynamics. The system is presumed to evolve during and/or after a quantum quench
in the parameter space. The quench can either be an impulse quench with
virtually instantaneous variation, or a periodic variation between two values.
The literature for the order parameter dynamics, described by the
time-dependent Ginzburg- Landau equations, is reviewed, and the works of the
author in this area highlighted. The mixed phase regime in the dual channel
case is also considered, and the dual order parameter dynamics of Fermi-Bose
mixtures reviewed. Finally, the nonequilibrium dynamics of the microscopic
degrees of freedom for the superfluid is reviewed for the self-consistent and
non self-consistent cases. The dynamics of the former can be described by the
Bogoliubov de-Gennes equations with the equilibrium BCS gap equation continued
in time and self -consistently coupled to the BdG dynamics. The latter is a
reduced BCS problem and can be mapped onto the dynamics of Ising and Kitaev
models. This article reviews the dynamics of both impulse quenches in the
Feshbach detuning, as well as periodic quenches in the chemical potential, and
highlights the author's contributions in this area of research.

high sensitivity and high dynamic range. Many of the cluster members are
detected, including some embedded, very low-mass objects, several protostars,
and substantial emission from the surrounding cloud. The Herschel data provide
sufficient spatial resolution to detect small-scale details, such as bright
filaments around the IRS5 protostar complex and a bubble-shaped rim associated
with the Class I object IRS2. The disks around the Class II objects display a
wide range of mid- and far-IR excesses consistent with different disk
structures. We have modeled the disks using the RADMC radiative transfer code,
finding an interesting mixture of objects for a young and presumably coeval
cluster. Some of them are consistent with flared, massive, relatively
primordial disks (SCrA, TCrA). Others display significant evidence for
inside-out evolution, consistent with the presence of inner holes/gaps (G-85,
G-87). Finally, we find disks with a dramatic small dust depletion (G-1,
HBC677) that, in some cases, could be related to truncation or to the presence
of large gaps in a flared disk (CrA-159). The derived masses for the disks
around the low-mass stars are found to be below the typical values in Taurus,
in agreement with previous Spitzer observations. Given the high degree of
multiplicity and interactions observed among the protostars in the region, the
diversity of disks may be a consequence of the early star formation history,
which should also be taken into account when studying the disk properties in
similar sparsely populated clusters.

start with a vector-like theory, but decouple one chirality (the ""mirror""
fermions) using strong Yukawa interactions with a chirally coupled ""Higgs""
field. While this is an attractive idea, its viability needs to be tested with
nonperturbative studies. The model that we study here, the so-called ""3-4-5""
model, is anomaly free and the presence of massless states in the mirror sector
is not required by anomaly matching arguments, in contrast to the ""1-0"" model
that was studied previously. We have computed the polarization tensor in this
theory and find a directional discontinuity that appears to be nonzero in the
limit of an infinite lattice, which is equivalent to the continuum limit at
fixed physical volume. We show that a similar behavior occurs for the free
massless Ginsparg-Wilson fermion, where the polarization tensor is known to
have a directional discontinuity in the continuum limit. We thus find support
for the conclusion that in the continuum limit of the 3-4-5 model, there are
massless charged modes in the mirror sector so that it does not decouple from
the light sector. The value of the discontinuity we obtain allows for two
interpretations: either a chiral gauge theory does not emerge and mirror-sector
fermions in a chiral anomaly free representation remain massless, or a massless
vectorlike mirror fermion appears. We end by discussing some questions for
future study.

experimental neutron diffraction structure analyses were used to determine the
low-temperature crystallographic and magnetic structure of bixbyite Mn2O3. The
energies of various magnetic arrangements, calculated from first principles,
were fit to a cluster-expansion model using a Bayesian method that overcomes a
problem of underfitting caused by the limited number of input magnetic
configurations. The model was used to predict the lowest-energy magnetic
states. Experimental determination of magnetic structure benefited from
optimized sample synthesis, which produced crystallite sizes large enough to
yield a clear splitting of peaks in the neutron powder diffraction patterns,
thereby enabling magnetic-structure refinements under the correct orthorhombic
symmetry. The refinements employed group theory to constrain magnetic models.
Computational and experimental analyses independently converged to similar
ground states, with identical antiferromagnetic ordering along a principal
magnetic axis and secondary ordering along a single orthogonal axis, differing
only by a phase factor in the modulation patterns. The lowest-energy magnetic
states are compromise solutions to frustrated antiferromagnetic interactions
between certain corner-sharing MnO6 octahedra.

""one-electron Universe"", we study the purely algebraic dynamics of the ensemble
of(two kinds of) identical point-like particles. These are represented by
the(real and complex conjugate) roots of a generic polynomial system of
equations that implicitly defines a single ""worldline"". The dynamics includes
events of ""merging"" of a pair of particles modelling the annihilation/creation
processes. Correlations in the location and motion of the particles-roots
relate, in particular, to the Vieta formulas. After a special choice of the
inertial-like reference frame, the linear Vieta formulas guarantee that, for
any worldline, the law of (non-relativistic) momentum conservation is
identically satisfied. Thus, the general structure of Newtonian mechanics
follows from the algebraic properties of a worldline alone. Some considerations
on relativization of the scheme are presented. A simple example of,
unexpectedly rich, ""polynomial dynamics"" is retraced in detail and illustrated
via an animation(available from ancillary file enclosed)

  arXiv:1211.6508, arXiv:1211.7056",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1965, Motzkin and Straus [5] provided a new proof of Turan's theorem based
on a continuous characterization of the clique number of a graph using the
Lagrangian of a graph. This new proof aroused interests in the study of
Lagrangians of r-uniform graphs. The Lagrangian of a hypergraph has been a
useful tool in hypergraph extremal problems. Sidorenko and Frankl-Furedi
applied Lagrangians of hypergraphs in finding Turan densities of hypergraphs.
Frankl and Rodl applied it in disproving Erdos' jumping constant conjecture. In
most applications, we need an upper bound for the Lagrangian of a hypergraph.
Frankl and Furedi conjectured that the r-uniform graph with m edges formed by
taking the first m sets in the colex ordering of $N^(r)$ has the largest
Lagrangian of all r-uniform graphs with m edges. Talbot in [14] provided some
evidences for Frankl and Furedi's conjecture. In this paper, we prove that the
r-uniform graph with m edges formed by taking the first m sets in the colex
ordering of $N^(r)$ has the largest Lagrangian of all r-uniform graphs on t
vertices with m edges when ${t choose r}-3$ or ${t choose r}-4$. As an
implication, we also prove that Frankl and Furedi's conjecture holds for
3-uniform graphs with ${t choose 3}-3$ or ${t choose 3}-4$ edges.

dominated by vacuum energy in the form of a cosmological constant, with
cosmological parameters obtained from full mission Planck satellite

general features of large scale structures in the universe and minimum stellar
mass as a function of redshift. Those assumptions also generate upper and lower
bounds on supermassive black hole mass in relation to total stellar mass of the
host galaxy, consistent with observations across four orders of magnitude of
