observe life: how people act, move and respond to external influences. They can
be utilized as measurement devices of individual persons and for groups of
people of the social context and the related interactions. The picture of human
life that emerges shows complexity, which is manifested in such data in
properties of the spatiotemporal tracks of individuals. We extract from
smartphone-based data for a set of persons important locations such as ""home"",
""work"" and so forth over fixed length time-slots covering the days in the
data-set. This set of typical places is heavy-tailed, a power-law distribution
with an exponent close to -1.7. To analyze the regularities and stochastic
features present, the days are classified for each person into regular,
personal patterns. To this are superimposed fluctuations for each day. This
randomness is measured by ""life"" entropy, computed both before and after
finding the clustering so as to subtract the contribution of a number of
patterns. The main issue, that we then address, is how predictable individuals
are in their mobility. The patterns and entropy are reflected in the
predictability of the mobility of the life both individually and on average. We
explore the simple approaches to guess the location from the typical behavior,
and of exploiting the transition probabilities with time from location or
activity A to B. The patterns allow an enhanced predictability, at least up to
a few hours into the future from the current location. Such fixed habits are
most clearly visible in the working-day length.

product states, a class of ansatz states for one-dimensional quantum fields

successful class of matrix product states. We discuss both attributes of the
physical states, e.g. by showing in detail how to compute expectation values,
as well as properties intrinsic to the representation itself, such as the gauge
freedom. We consider general translation non-invariant systems made of several
particle species and derive certain regularity properties that need to be
satisfied by the variational parameters. We also devote a section to the
translation invariant setting in the thermodynamic limit and show how
continuous matrix product states possess an intrinsic ultraviolet cutoff.
Finally, we introduce a new set of states which are tangent to the original set
of continuous matrix product states. For the case of matrix product states,
this construction has recently proven relevant in the development of new
algorithms for studying time evolution and elementary excitations of quantum
spin chains. We thus lay the foundation for similar developments for
one-dimensional quantum fields.

of the brane-anti-brane pair in a collision, where the branes are
three-dimensional objects in a higher-dimensional Universe. Spontaneous
symmetry breaking accompanied by the formation of lower-dimensional topological
defects, e.g. cosmic strings, is triggered by the so-called `tachyon
condensation', where the existence of tachyons is attributable to the
instability of the brane-anti-brane system. Here, we discuss the closest
analogue of the tachyon condensation in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. We
consider annihilation of domain walls, namely branes, in strongly segregated
two-component condensates, where one component is sandwiched by two domains of
the other component. In this system, the process of the brane annihilation can
be projected effectively as ferromagnetic ordering dynamics onto a
two-dimensional space. Based on this correspondence, three-dimensional
formation of vortices from a domain-wall annihilation is considered to be a
kink formation due to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the two-dimensional
space. We also discuss a mechanism to create a `vorton' when the sandwiched
component has a vortex string bridged between the branes. We hope that this

achieving it are well-studied in both statistics and machine learning. In many
applications, however, the predictions are used to make decisions that select
which observations are made. This makes calibration difficult, as adjusting
predictions to achieve calibration changes future data. We focus on
click-through-rate (CTR) prediction for search ad auctions. Here, CTR
predictions are used by an auction that determines which ads are shown, and we
want to maximize the value generated by the auction.
  We show that certain natural notions of calibration can be impossible to
achieve, depending on the details of the auction. We also show that it can be
impossible to maximize auction efficiency while using calibrated predictions.
Finally, we give conditions under which calibration is achievable and
simultaneously maximizes auction efficiency: roughly speaking, bids and queries
must not contain information about CTRs that is not already captured by the
predictions.

Cephei and HD 196885 are numerically integrated using various numerical
techniques to assess the chaotic or quasi-periodic nature of the dynamical
system considered. The Hill stability (HS) function which measures the orbital
perturbation of a planet around the primary star due to the secondary star is
calculated for each system. The maximum Lyapunov exponent (MLE) time series are
generated to measure the divergence/convergence rate of stable manifolds, which
are used to differentiate between chaotic and non-chaotic orbits. Then, we
calculate dynamical Mean Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits (MEGNO)
maps from solving the variational equations along with the equations of motion.
These maps allow us to accurately differentiate between stable and unstable
dynamical systems. The results obtained from the analysis of HS, MLE, and MEGNO
maps are analysed for their dynamical variations and resemblance. The HS test
for the planets shows stability and quasi-periodicity for at least ten million
years. The MLE and the MEGNO maps have also indicated the local
quasi-periodicity and global stability in a relatively short integration
period. The orbital stability of the systems is tested using each indicator for
various values of planet inclinations (i_{pl} \le 25^\circ) and binary
eccentricities. The reliability of HS criterion is also discussed based on its
stability results compared with the MLE and MEGNO maps.

  High-energy radiation bursts are commonplace in our Universe. From nearby
solar flares to distant gamma ray bursts, a variety of physical processes
accelerate charged particles to a wide range of energies, which subsequently
reach the Earth. Such particles contribute to a number of physical processes
occurring in the Earth system. A large fraction of the energy of charged
particles gets deposited in the atmosphere, ionizing the atmosphere, causing
changes in its chemistry and affecting the global electric circuit. Remaining
secondary particles contribute to the background dose of cosmic rays on the
surface and parts of the subsurface region. Life has evolved over the past ~ 3
billion years in presence of this background radiation, which itself has varied
considerably during the period. As demonstrated by the Miller-Urey experiment,
lightning plays a very important role in the formation of complex organic
molecules, which are the building blocks of more complex structures forming
life. There is growing evidence of increase in the lightning rate with
increasing flux of charged particles. Is there a connection between enhanced
rate of cosmic rays and the origin of life? Cosmic ray secondaries are also
known to damage DNA and cause mutations, leading to cancer and other diseases.
It is now possible to compute radiation doses from secondary particles, in
particular muons and neutrons. Have the variations in cosmic ray flux affected
the evolution of life on earth? We describe the mechanisms of cosmic rays
affecting terrestrial life and review the potential implications of the
variation of high-energy astrophysical radiation on the history of life on
earth.

When the dimension of the feature space and the number of samples are extremely
large, solving the Lasso problem remains challenging. To improve the efficiency
of solving large-scale Lasso problems, El Ghaoui and his colleagues have
proposed the SAFE rules which are able to quickly identify the inactive
predictors, i.e., predictors that have $0$ components in the solution vector.
Then, the inactive predictors or features can be removed from the optimization
problem to reduce its scale. By transforming the standard Lasso to its dual
form, it can be shown that the inactive predictors include the set of inactive
constraints on the optimal dual solution. In this paper, we propose an
efficient and effective screening rule via Dual Polytope Projections (DPP),
which is mainly based on the uniqueness and nonexpansiveness of the optimal
dual solution due to the fact that the feasible set in the dual space is a
convex and closed polytope. Moreover, we show that our screening rule can be
extended to identify inactive groups in group Lasso. To the best of our
knowledge, there is currently no ""exact"" screening rule for group Lasso. We
have evaluated our screening rule using synthetic and real data sets. Results
show that our rule is more effective in identifying inactive predictors than
existing state-of-the-art screening rules for Lasso.

luminosities, redshifts and morphologies. However, when we fix these quantities
and morphology, we still find large dispersions in the galaxy size
distribution. We investigate the origin of these dispersions for red early-type
galaxies, using two SDSS-based catalogs. We find that the sizes of faint
galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) < 10.3 or M_r > -19.5, where M_r is the r-band
absolute magnitude, k-corrected to z = 0.1) are affected more significantly by
luminosity, while the sizes of bright galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) > 11.4 or M_r
< -21.4) are by dynamical mass. At fixed mass and luminosity, the sizes of
low-mass galaxies (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10.45 and M_r ~ -19.8) are relatively
less sensitive to their colors, color gradients and axis ratios. On the other
hand, the sizes of intermediate-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 10.85 and M_r ~ -20.4)
and high-mass (log(M_dyn/M_sun) ~ 11.25 and M_r ~ -21.0) galaxies significantly
depend on those parameters, in the sense that larger red early-type galaxies
have bluer colors, more negative color gradients (bluer outskirts) and smaller
axis ratios. These results indicate that the sizes of intermediate- and
high-mass red early-type galaxies are significantly affected by their recent
minor mergers or rotations, whereas the sizes of low-mass red early-type

self-consistent scaling relationships based on emission-line widths and
continuum luminosities. The emission lines used, H-beta, Mg II, and C IV, have
different dependencies on orientation as estimated by radio core dominance. We
compare differences in the log of black hole masses estimated from different
emission lines and show that they depend on radio core dominance in the sense
that core-dominated, jet-on objects have systematically smaller H-beta and Mg
II determined masses compared to those from C IV, while lobe-dominated edge-on
objects have systematically larger H-beta and Mg II determined masses compared
to those from C IV. The effect is consistent with the H-beta line width, and to
a lesser extent that of Mg II, being dependent upon orientation in the sense of
a axisymmetric velocity field plus a projection effect. The size of the effect
is nearly an order of magnitude in black hole mass going from one extreme
orientation to the other. We find that radio spectral index is a good proxy for
radio core dominance and repeating this analysis with radio spectral index
yields similar results. Accounting for orientation could in principle
significantly reduce the scatter in black hole mass scaling relationships, and
we quantify and offer a correction for this effect cast in terms of radio core
dominance and radio spectral index.

the dynamical decay of massive black holes in galactic nuclei. The model
considers that the flow is ballistic, and gives fully analytical expressions
for both the accretion rate onto the point mass, and the gravitational drag it
suffers. The expressions are further simplified by taking the limits of a
thick, and of a thin disk. The results for the thick disk reduce correctly to
those for a uniform density environment (Cant\'o et al. 2011). We find that for
a thin disk (small vertical scaleheight compared to the gravitational radius)
the accretion rate is proportional to the mass of the moving object and to the
surface density of the disk, while the drag force is independent of the
velocity of the object. The gravitational deceleration of the hypersonic
perturber in a thin disk was found to be independent of its parameters (i.e.
mass or velocity) and depends only on the surface mass density of the disk. The
predictions of the model are compared to the results of three-dimensional

using simple life histories. However, life-history models predict that males
benefit from increasing sexual investment approaching old age, producing
age-dependent sexual traits. Age-dependent traits require time and energy to
grow, and will not fully mature before individuals enter mating competition.
Early evolutionary stages pose several problems for these traits. Age-dependent
traits suffer from strong viability selection and gain little benefit from mate
choice when rare. Few males will grow large traits, and they will rarely
encounter choosy females. The evolutionary origins of age-dependent traits
therefore remain unclear. I used numerical simulations to analyze evolution of
preferences, condition (viability) and traits in an age-structured population.
Traits in the model depended on age and condition (""good genes"") in a
population with no genetic drift. I asked (1) if age-dependent indicator traits
and their preferences can originate depending on the strength of selection and
the size of the trait; (2) which mode of development (age-dependent versus
age-independent) eventually predominates when both modes occur in the
population; and (3) if age-independent traits can invade a population with
age-dependent traits. Age-dependent traits evolve under weaker selection and at
smaller sizes than age-independent traits. Evolution of age-independent traits
depends only on trait size, whereas evolution of age-dependent traits depends
on both strength of selection and growth rate. Invasion of age-independence
into populations with established traits followed a similar pattern with
age-dependence predominating at small trait sizes. I suggest that reduced adult
mortality facilitates sexual selection by favoring the evolution of
age-dependent sexual signals under weak selection.

been proposed for some time that Pluto lies in the region of slow hydrodynamic
escape. Using a hybrid fluid/molecular-kinetic model, we previously
demonstrated the typical implementation of this model fails to correctly
describe the appropriate temperature structure for the upper atmosphere for
solar minimum conditions. Here we use a time-dependent solver to allow us to
extend those simulations to higher heating rates and we examine fluid models in
which Jeans-like escape expressions are used for the upper boundary conditions.
We compare these to hybrid simulations of the atmosphere under heating
conditions roughly representative of solar minimum and mean conditions as these
bracket conditions expected during the New Horizon encounter. Although we find
escape rates comparable to those previously estimated by the slow hydrodynamic
escape model, and roughly consistent with energy limited escape, our model
produces a much more extended atmosphere with higher temperatures roughly
consistent with recent observations of CO. Such an extended atmosphere will be
affected by Charon and will affect Pluto's interaction with the solar wind at
the New Horizon encounter. Since we have previously shown that such models can
be scaled, these results have implications for modeling exoplanet atmospheres
for which the energy limited escape approximation is often used.

predicted to share some features of standard thermodynamic glass transitions

generalize the pinning particle procedure. We study a mean-field system where

at a lower temperature $T$. A more complicated physics emerges from this

reach can be extended to 3-4 TeV. The ILC can discover this signature even if
annihilation to electrons provides only a small fraction of the total dark

integers $\epsilon_i$= 0, -1 or 1 for d/2<i<d, where d = dim R, we shall
construct a d-dimensional Cohen-Macaulay local ring R (of characteristic p) and
a maximal primary ideal I of R such that the Hilbert-Kunz function of R is a
polynomial in p^n of degree d whose coefficient of $(p^n)^i$ is the product of
$\epsilon_i$ and a positive rational number for d/2< i<d. The existence of such
ring is proved by using Segre products to construct a Cohen-Macaulay ring such
that the Chow group of the ring is of certain simplicity and that test modules
exists for it.

the minimum entanglement, as quantified by the negativity, that is created

degree of nonclassicality on the measured subsystems. We demonstrate a number
of possible different interpretations for this measure, and for the concept of
quantumness of correlations in general. In particular, for general bipartite
states in which the measured subsystem is a qubit, the negativity of
quantumness acquires a geometric interpretation as the minimum trace distance
from the set of classically correlated states. This can be further
reinterpreted as minimum disturbance, with respect to trace norm, due to a
local measurement or a nontrivial local unitary operation. We calculate the
negativity of quantumness in closed form for Werner and isotropic states, and
for all two-qubit states for which the reduced state of the system that is

theory consists of a mixed electromagnetic and chiral anomaly term in the bulk,
and a combination of pure and mixed anomalies for the surface. In this paper we
demonstrate the existence of fermion zero modes in the dilute vortex phase

intimate connection with the anomaly, we propose an effective topological field

be the lightest superpartner and evade LHC searches because it decays into two

searches for RPV stops produced in gluino cascades. While typical searches for
gluinos decaying to stops rely on same-sign dileptons, the RPV cascades usually
have fewer hard leptons, less excess missing energy, and more jets than
R-parity conserving cascades. If the gluino is a Dirac fermion, same-sign
dilepton signals are also often highly depleted. We therefore explore search
strategies that use single-lepton channels, and combat backgrounds using HT,
jet counting, and more detailed multijet kinematics or jet substructure. We
demonstrate that the stop mass peaks can be fully reconstructed over a broad
range of spectra, even given the very high jet multiplicities. This would not
only serve as a ""double-discovery"" opportunity, but would also be a spectacular
confirmation that the elusive top-partner has been hiding in multijets.

source which brightened in a single-epoch image to at least six times the upper
limit from the corresponding deep image. We also find a source associated with
a z = 0.6 quasar which appears to have brightened by a factor of about three in
one of our deep images, when compared to catalogs from legacy surveys.
  We place new upper limits on the number of transients brighter than 10 mJy:
fewer than 0.08 transients / sq. deg. with characteristic timescales of months
to years; fewer than 0.02 / sq. deg. with timescales of months; and fewer than
0.009 / sq. deg with timescales of days. We also plot upper limits as a

exoplanet host stars. The masses of host stars are commonly estimated by
comparing their spectra to those predicted by stellar evolution models.
However, spectroscopically determined properties are difficult to measure
accurately for stars that are substantially different from the Sun, such as
M-dwarfs and evolved stars. Here, we propose a new method to dynamically
measure the masses of transiting planets near mean-motion resonances and their
host stars by combining observations of transit timing variations with radial
velocity measurements. We derive expressions to analytically determine the mass
of each member of the system and demonstrate the technique on the Kepler-18
system. We compare these analytic results to numerical simulations and find the
two are consistent. We identify eight systems for which our technique could be
applied if follow-up radial velocity measurements are collected. We conclude
this analysis would be optimal for systems discovered by next generation
missions similar to TESS or PLATO, which will target bright stars that are
amenable to efficient RV follow-up.

our Galaxy and populate the transition between the stellar and planetary mass
regime. There is however no agreement on the processes responsible for their
formation. Aims. We have conducted a large survey of the young, nearby cluster
IC 348, to uncover its low-mass brown dwarf population and study the cluster
properties in the substellar regime. Methods. Deep optical and near-IR images
taken with MegaCam and WIRCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) were
used to select photometric candidate members. A spectroscopic follow-up of a
large fraction of the candidates was conducted to assess their youth and
membership. Results. We confirmed spectroscopically 16 new members of the IC
348 cluster, including 13 brown dwarfs, contributing significantly to the
substellar census of the cluster, where only 30 brown dwarfs were previously
known. Five of the new members have a L0 spectral type, the latest-type objects
found to date in this cluster. At 3 Myr, evolutionary models estimate these
brown dwarfs to have a mass of ~13 Jupiter masses. Combining the new members
with previous census of the cluster, we constructed the IMF complete down to 13
Jupiter masses. Conclusions. The IMF of IC 348 is well fitted by a log-normal
function, and we do not see evidence for variations of the mass function down
to planetary masses when compared to other young clusters.

emitted bound-bound and free-bound radiation leading to spectral distortions to
the cosmic microwave background. These distortions might become observable in
the future with high-sensitivity spectrometers, and provide a new window into
physical conditions in the early universe. The standard multilevel atom method
habitually used to compute the recombination spectrum is computationally
expensive, impeding a detailed quantitative exploration of the information
contained in spectral distortions thus far. In this work it is shown that the
emissivity in optically thin allowed transitions can be factored into a
computationally expensive but cosmology-independent part and a computationally
cheap, cosmology-dependent part. The slow part of the computation consists in
pre-computing temperature-dependent effective ""conductances"", linearly relating
line or continuum intensity to departures from Saha equilibrium of the
lowest-order excited states (2s and 2p), that can be seen as ""voltages"". The
computation of these departures from equilibrium as a function of redshift is
itself very fast, thanks to the effective multilevel atom method introduced in
an earlier work. With this factorization, the recurring cost of a single
computation of the recombination spectrum is only a fraction of a second on a
standard laptop, more than four orders of magnitude shorter than standard
computations. The spectrum from helium recombination can be efficiently
computed in an identical way, and a fast code computing the full primordial

power-law photon indices of \Gamma~1.4-2.0; two of them show some X-ray

other source, J0850+4451, has only three hard X-ray photons detected and is
probably heavily obscured (N_H>3x10^{23} cm^{-2}). This object is also
identified as a low-ionization broad absorption line (BAL) quasar based on Mg
II \lambda2799 absorption; it is the first disc-like emitter reported that is
also a BAL quasar. The IR-to-UV spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these
eight sources are similar to the mean SEDs of typical quasars with a UV ""bump"",

differs from low-luminosity disc-like emitters. Studies of the X-ray-to-optical

must illuminate and ionize the outer disc efficiently (~15% of the nuclear

to work in high-luminosity objects, as their geometrically thin inner discs
decrease the amount of direct illumination possible for a flat disc.

Feeman (2012, Comput. Stat. Data An.)) is considered. The paper provides mean
and variance of the members of this class, and examines their consistency and
asymptotic distribution. Specifically, the results are for the estimation of
population mean, population variance and CDF. We show that any estimators of
the class may be less efficient than Simple Random Sampling (SRS) estimator for
small sample sizes. We prove that the relative efficiency of some estimators in
the class with respect to Balanced Ranked Set Sampling (BRSS) estimator tends
to 1 as the sample size goes to infinity. Furthermore, the standard JPS mean
estimator and, Frey and Feeman JPS mean estimator are specifically studied and
we show that two estimator have the same asymptotic distribution. For the
standard JPS mean estimator, in perfect ranking situations, optimum values of H
(the ranking class size), for different sample sizes, are determined
non-parametrically for populations that are not heavily skewed or thick tailed.
We show that the standard JPS mean estimator may be more efficient than BRSS

next-generation cellular networks. Cellular networks with small cells take on a
very heterogeneous characteristic, and are often referred to as HetNets. In
this paper, we introduce a load-aware model for CA-enabled \textit{multi}-band
HetNets. Under this model, the impact of biasing can be more appropriately
characterized; for example, it is observed that with large enough biasing, the
spectral efficiency of small cells may increase while its counterpart in a
fully-loaded model always decreases. Further, our analysis reveals that the
peak data rate does not depend on the base station density and transmit powers;
this strongly motivates other approaches e.g. CA to increase the peak data
rate. Last but not least, different band deployment configurations are studied
and compared. We find that with large enough small cell density, spatial reuse
with small cells outperforms adding more spectrum for increasing user rate.
More generally, universal cochannel deployment typically yields the largest
rate; and thus a capacity loss exists in orthogonal deployment. This
performance gap can be reduced by appropriately tuning the HetNet coverage
distribution (e.g. by optimizing biasing factors).

in future. We distinguish two models. For the first one, we do not take into
account the influence of Intra-Group Matter (IGrM). In this case we demonstrate
that for currently known parameters of this system the collision is hardly
plausible because of the angular momentum. These galaxies will approach the
minimum distance of about 290 Kpc in 4.44 Gyr from present and then begin to
run away irreversibly from each other. For the second model, we take into
account dynamical friction due to IGrM. We find a characteristic value of the
IGrM particle velocity dispersion $\tilde\sigma=2.306$. For
$\tilde\sigma\leq2.306$ the merger will take place, but for the bigger values
of $\tilde\sigma$ the merger can be problematic. If the temperature of the IGrM
particles is $10^5$ K, this characteristic value of $\tilde\sigma$ corresponds
to the IGrM particle mass 17 MeV. Therefore, for the IGrM particles with masses
less than 17 MeV the merger becomes problematic. We also define the region in
the vicinity of our Local Group where the formation of Hubble flows starts. For
such processes the zero-acceleration surface (where gravitational attraction is
balanced by cosmological accelerated expansion) plays the crucial role. We show
that such surface is absent for the Local Group. Instead, we find two points
and one circle with zero acceleration. Nevertheless, there is a nearly closed
area around the MW and M31 where the absolute value of the acceleration is

resources that are consumed in transit: the movement of two pebbles across an
edge consumes one of the pebbles. The pebbling number of a graph is the fewest
number of pebbles t so that, from any initial configuration of t pebbles on its
vertices, one can place a pebble on any given target vertex via such pebbling
steps. It is known that deciding if a given configuration on a particular graph
can reach a specified target is NP-complete, even for diameter two graphs, and
that deciding if the pebbling number has a prescribed upper bound is
\Pi_2^P-complete.
  On the other hand, for many families of graphs there are formulas or
polynomial algorithms for computing pebbling numbers; for example, complete
graphs, products of paths (including cubes), trees, cycles, diameter two
graphs, and more. Moreover, graphs having minimum pebbling number are called
Class 0, and many authors have studied which graphs are Class 0 and what graph
properties guarantee it, with no characterization in sight.
  In this paper we investigate an important family of diameter three chordal
graphs called split graphs; graphs whose vertex set can be partitioned into a
clique and an independent set. We provide a formula for the pebbling number of
a split graph, along with an algorithm for calculating it that runs in
O(n^\beta) time, where \beta=2\omega/(\omega+1)\cong 1.41 and \omega\cong 2.376
is the exponent of matrix multiplication. Furthermore we determine that all
split graphs with minimum degree at least 3 are Class 0.

binary alphabet and take a graph theoretic view. An $n$-bit $s$-deletion
correcting code is an independent set in a particular graph. We propose
constructing such a code by taking the union of many constant Hamming weight
codes. This results in codes that have additional structure. Searching for
codes in constant Hamming weight induced subgraphs is computationally easier
than searching the original graph. We prove a lower bound on size of a codebook
constructed this way for any number of deletions and show that it is only a
small factor below the corresponding lower bound on unrestricted codes. In the
single deletion case, we find optimal colorings of the constant Hamming weight
induced subgraphs. We show that the resulting code is asymptotically optimal.
We discuss the relationship between codes and colorings and observe that the VT
codes are optimal in a coloring sense. We prove a new lower bound on the
chromatic number of the deletion channel graphs. Colorings of the deletion
channel graphs that match this bound do not necessarily produce asymptotically
optimal codes.

the ratio of the atomic tensor Stark shift to the Zeeman shift is a facto
mu~100. We expand the complete time evolution operator in inverse powers of
this ratio; complete results are presented for atoms of total spin F=3, 4, and

potential systematic errors enter only as even powers of 1/mu, making the
expansion rapidly convergent. The remaining EDM mimicking effects are further
suppressed in a proposed double-differential setup, where the final state is
interrogated in a differential laser configuration, and the direction of the
strong electric field also is inverted. Estimates of the signal available at
existing accelerator facilities indicate that the proposed apparatus offers the
potential for a drastic improvement in EDM limits over existing measurements,

four particles per pinning site, the particles adopt a hexagonal ordering,
while for five particles per pinning site, a square ordering appears. For

variety of distinct ordering regimes, including disordered grain boundaries,
crystalline stripe structures, superlattice orderings, and disordered patchy

low mass dark matter haloes than has been observed in the Local Group of
galaxies. One possible explanation is the increased difficulty of detecting
these haloes if most of the visible matter is lost at early evolutionary phases
through galactic winds. In this work we study the current models of triggering
galactic winds in dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph) from supernovae, and study,
based on 3D hydrodynamic numerical simulations, the correlation of the mass
loss rates and important physical parameters as the dark matter halo mass and
its radial profile, and the star formation rate. We find that the existence of
winds is ubiquitous, independent on the gravitational potential. Our
simulations revealed that the Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) may play a
major role on pushing matter out of these systems, even for very massive
haloes. The instability is responsible for 5 - 40% of the mass loss during the
early evolution of the galaxy, being less relevant at $t > 200$Myrs. There is
no significant difference in the mass loss rates obtained for the different
dark matter profiles studied (NFW and logarithmic). We have also found a
correlation between the mass loss rate and both the halo mass and the rate of
supernovae, as already reported in previous works. Besides, the epoch in which
most of the baryon galactic matter is removed from the galaxy varies depending
on the SN rate and gravitational potential. The later, combined to the
importance of the RTI in each model, may change our understanding about the
chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies, as well as in the heavy element
contamination of the intergalactic medium at high redshifts.

used for numerically simulating quantum computing for a decade. We introduce
our C++ library ZKCM_QC developed for multiprecision TDMPS simulations of
quantum circuits. Besides its practical usability, the library is useful for
evaluation of the method itself. With the library, we can capture two types of
numerical errors in the TDMPS simulations: one due to rounding errors caused by
the shortage in mantissa portions of floating-point numbers; the other due to
truncations of nonnegligible Schmidt coefficients and their corresponding
Schmidt vectors. We numerically analyze these errors in TDMPS simulations of
quantum computing.

Bose-Einstein condensates. This conceptually surprising approach provides a
novel path towards a better control of quantum many-body correlations.

August, 2011. The surge rises vertically from its origin upto a height of 65 Mm
with a terminal velocity of 100 km/s, and thereafter falls and fades gradually.
The total life time of the surge was 20 min. We also measure the temperature
and density distribution of the observed surge during its maximum rise, and
found an average temperature and density of 2.0 MK and 4.1 x 109 cm-3,
respectively. The temperature map shows the expansion and mixing of cool plasma
lagging behind the hot coronal plasma along the surge. As SDO/HMI temporal
image data does not show any detectable evidence of the significant
photospheric magnetic field cancellation for the formation of the observed
surge, we infer that it is probably driven by magnetic reconnection generated
thermal energy in the lower chromosphere. The radiance (thus mass density)
oscillations near the base of the surge are also evident, which may be the most
likely signature of its formation by a reconnection generated pulse. In support
of the present observational base-line of the triggering of the surge due to
chromospheric heating, we devise a numerical model with conceivable
implementation of VAL-C atmosphere and a thermal pulse as an initial trigger.
We find that the pulse steepens into a slow shock at higher altitudes that
triggers plasma perturbations exhibiting the observed features of the surge,
e.g., terminal velocity, height, width, life-time, and heated fine structures
near its base.

often encountered in the verification of properties of complex systems such as
concurrent interactive systems. The modular approach is based on the
observation that properties of interest often concern a rather small portion of
the system. As a consequence, reduced models can be constructed which
approximate the overall system behaviour thus allowing more efficient
verification.
  Biochemical pathways can be seen as complex concurrent interactive systems.
Consequently, verification of their properties is often computationally very
expensive and could take advantage of the modular approach.
  In this paper we report preliminary results on the development of a modular
verification framework for biochemical pathways. We view biochemical pathways
as concurrent systems of reactions competing for molecular resources. A modular
verification technique could be based on reduced models containing only
reactions involving molecular resources of interest.
  For a proper description of the system behaviour we argue that it is
essential to consider a suitable notion of fairness, which is a
well-established notion in concurrency theory but novel in the field of pathway
modelling. We propose a modelling approach that includes fairness and we
identify the assumptions under which verification of properties can be done in
a modular way.
  We prove the correctness of the approach and demonstrate it on the model of
the EGF receptor-induced MAP kinase cascade by Schoeberl et al.

triple minor planets) in the Solar system are of particular interest to the
scientific community since the discovery of the first triple asteroid system in
2004. In this paper, the Hill stability of the nine known triple minor planets
in the Solar system is investigated. Seven of the systems are of large size
ratio, i.e. they consist of a larger primary and two moonlets, while the other
two systems have components of comparable size. Each case is treated
separately. For the triple minor planets that have large size ratio, the
sufficient condition for Hill stability is expressed in closed form. This is
not possible for the systems with comparable size components, for which the
Hill stability is assessed by a combination of analytical and numerical means.
It is found that all the known triple minor planets are Hill stable, except
3749 Balam, for which the incomplete orbital parameters make the Hill stability
of the system uncertain. This suggests that there might be more such stable
triple minor planets in the Solar system yet to be observed. It is also shown
that the Hill stability regions increase as the mutual inclination between the
inner orbit and outer orbit decreases, the semimajor axis ratio of the inner
orbit with respect to the outer orbit decreases, and the mass ratio of the
outer satellite with respect to the inner satellite increases. This study
therefore provides useful information about dynamical properties of the triple
minor planets in the Solar system.

which limits their experimental accessibility by smearing out the individual
phenomenology. The Langmuir technique, however, allows the examination of
defined interfaces, whose controllable thermodynamic state enables one to
explore the proper state diagrams. Here we demonstrate that voltage and
pressure pulses simultaneously propagate along monolayers comprised of either
native pork brain or synthetic lipids. The excitation of pulses is conducted by
the application of small droplets of acetic acid and monitored subsequently
employing timeresolved Wilhelmy plate and Kelvin probe measurements. The
isothermal state diagrams of the monolayers for both lateral pressure and
surface potential are experimentally recorded, enabling us to predict dynamic
voltage pulse amplitudes of 0,1 to 3mV based on the assumption of static
mechano-electrical coupling. We show that the underlying physics for such
propagating pulses is the same for synthetic (DPPC) and natural extracted (Pork
Brain) lipids and that the measured propagation velocities and pulse amplitudes
depend on the compressibility of the interface. Given the ubiquitous presence
of hydrated interfaces in biology, our experimental findings seem to support a

method of `average directional vectors', which traces the directions in which
the trajectory (recurrently) passes through a chosen phase-space cell, and the
`recurrence-matrix' method, which consists of statistics over the recurrences

Integrable interactions are synonymous with non-diffractive scattering, meaning
that the set of incoming momenta for any scattering event coincides with the
set of outgoing momenta. A system is integrable if the two particle scattering
matrix obeys the Yang--Baxter equation. Nonintegrable interactions correspond
to diffractive scattering, where the set of outgoing momenta may take on all
values consistent with energy and momentum conservation. Such processes play a
vital role in the kinetics of one dimensional gases, where binary collisions
are unable to alter the distribution function.
  When integrability is broken weakly, the result is a small diffractive
scattering amplitude. Our main result is a simple formula for the diffractive
part of the scattering amplitude, when the violation of the Yang--Baxter
equation is small. Although the derivation is given for delta-function
interactions, the result depends only on the two-particle scattering matrix,
and should therefore also apply to finite-range interactions close to
integrable.

bipartitions. As a special case, we examine the class of balanced pure states,
which are constructed from a subset of the Pauli group P_n that is isomorphic
to Z_2^n. This makes a connection with the theory of quantum error-correcting
codes and provides bounds on the largest allowed k for fixed n. In particular,
the ratio k/n can be lower and upper bounded in the asymptotic regime, implying
that there must exist multipartite entangled states with at least k=0.189 n
when $n\to \infty$. We also analyze symmetric states as another natural class
of states with high multipartite entanglement and prove that, surprisingly,
they cannot have all maximally mixed k-qubit reductions with k>1. Thus,
measured through bipartite entanglement across all bipartitions, symmetric
states cannot exhibit large entanglement. However, we show that the permutation
symmetry only constrains some components of the generalized Bloch vector, so
that very specific patterns in this vector may be allowed even though k>1 is
forbidden. This is illustrated numerically for a few symmetric states that
maximize geometric entanglement, revealing some interesting structures.

  for publication in PRD",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.87.043505",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maxima of the linear density field form a point process that can be used to
understand the spatial distribution of virialized halos that collapsed from
initially overdense regions. However, owing to the peak constraint, clustering
statistics of discrete density peaks are difficult to evaluate. For this
reason, local bias schemes have received considerably more attention in the
literature thus far. In this paper, we show that the 2-point correlation
function of maxima of a homogeneous and isotropic Gaussian random field can be
thought of, up to second order at least, as arising from a local bias expansion
formulated in terms of rotationally invariant variables. This expansion relies
on a unique smoothing scale, which is the Lagrangian radius of dark matter
halos. The great advantage of this local bias approach is that it circumvents
the difficult computation of joint probability distributions. We demonstrate
that the bias factors associated with these rotational invariants can be
computed using a peak-background split argument, in which the background
perturbation shifts the corresponding probability distribution functions.
Consequently, the bias factors are orthogonal polynomials averaged over those
spatial locations that satisfy the peak constraint. In particular, asphericity
in the peak profile contributes to the clustering at quadratic and higher
order, with bias factors given by generalized Laguerre polynomials. We
speculate that our approach remains valid at all orders, and that it can be
extended to describe clustering statistics of any point process of a Gaussian
random field. Our results will be very useful to model the clustering of
discrete tracers with more realistic collapse prescriptions involving the tidal
shear for instance.

($\Sigma=V+S=0$) symmetries including a tensor interaction. As an application,
the Dirac equation with scalar, vector and tensor Cornell radial potentials is
considered and the correct solution to this problem is obtained.

atmosphere are the smoothness of the closed field corona, the accumulation of
magnetic shear at photospheric polarity inversion lines (PIL), and the
complexity of the slow wind. We propose that a single process, helicity
condensation, is the physical mechanism giving rise to all three features. A
simplified model is presented for how helicity is injected and transported in
the closed corona by magnetic reconnection. With this model we demonstrate that
helicity must condense onto PILs and coronal hole boundaries, and estimate the
rate of helicity accumulation at PILs and the loss to the wind. Our results can
account for many of the observed properties of the closed corona and wind.

experience and capitalization of already solved cases (source cases) to find a
solution to a new problem (target case). Retrieval phase consists on
identifying source cases that are similar to the target case. This phase may
lead to erroneous results if the existing knowledge imperfections are not taken
into account. This work presents a novel solution based on Fuzzy logic
techniques and adaptation measures which aggregate weighted similarities to
improve the retrieval results. To confirm the efficiency of our solution, we
have applied it to the industrial diagnosis domain. The obtained results are
more efficient results than those obtained by applying typical measures.

  (under title ""On a congruence modulo $n^3$ involving two consecutive sums of
  powers"")",,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For various positive integers $k$, the sums of $k$th powers of the first $n$
positive integers, $S_k(n+1)=1^k+2^k+...+n^k$, have got to be some of the most
popular sums in all of mathematics. In this note we prove that for each $k\ge 2
  $$ 2S_{2k+1}(n)- (2k+1)nS_{2k}(n)\equiv \{{array}{ll}
  0\,(\bmod{\,n^3}) & {\rm if}\,\,k\,\,{\rm is\,\,even\,\,or}\,\, n\,\, {\rm
is\,\, odd} & {\rm or} \,\, n\equiv 0\,(\bmod{\,4})
\frac{n^3}{2}\,(\bmod{\,n^3}) & {\rm if}\,\,k\,\,{\rm is\,\, odd} &,\,{\rm
and}\,\, n\equiv 2\,(\bmod{\,4}). {array}.$$
  The above congruence allows us to state an equivalent formulation of Giuga's
conjecture. Moreover, we prove that the first above congruence is satisfied
modulo $n^4$ whenever $n\ge 5$ is a prime number such that $n-1\nmid 2k-2$. In
particular, this congruence arises a conjecture for a prime to be Wolstenholme
prime. We also propose several Giuga-Agoh's-like conjectures. Further, we
establish two congruences modulo $n^3$ for two binomial type sums involving
sums of powers $S_{2i}(n)$ with $i=0,1,...,k$. Furthermore, using the above
congruence reduced modulo $n^2$, we obtain an extension of Carlitz-von Staudt
result for odd power sums.

the need to model antibacterial surfaces, biofilm formation, and the effect of
DNAse in treating and preventing biofilm infections. As its predecessor, SPiM,
BioScape has a sequential semantics based on Gillespie's algorithm, and its
implementation does not scale beyond 1000 agents. However, in order to model
larger and more realistic systems, a semantics that may take advantage of the
new multi-core and GPU architectures is needed. This motivates the introduction
of parallel semantics, which is the contribution of this paper: Parallel
BioScape, an extension with fully parallel semantics.
