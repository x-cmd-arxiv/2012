time, first formulated as an infinite-dimensional variational inequality in
Friesz et al. (1993). In deriving our existence result, we employ the
generalized Vickrey model (GVM) introduced in and to formulate the underlying
network loading problem. As we explain, the GVM corresponds to a path delay
operator that is provably strongly continuous on the Hilbert space of interest.
Finally, we provide the desired SRDC-DUE existence result for general
constraints relating path flows to a table of fixed trip volumes without
invocation of a priori bounds on the path flows.

premelting and nonequilibrium shearing behaviors of $[001]$ symmetric tilt

characterize the dependence of the premelted layer width $W$ as a function of
temperature and misorientation and compute the thermodynamic disjoining
potential whose derivative with respect to $W$ represents the structural force
between crystal-melt interfaces due to the spatial overlap of density waves.
The disjoining potential is also computed by molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations, for quantitative comparison with PFC simulations, and
coarse-grained amplitude equations (AE) derived from PFC that provide
additional analytical insights. We find that, for GBs over an intermediate
range of misorientation ($\theta_{\rm min}<\theta<\theta_{\rm max}$), $W$
diverges as the melting temperature is approached from below, corresponding to
a purely repulsive disjoining potential, while for GBs outside this range
($\theta<\theta_{\rm min}$ or $\theta_{\rm max}<\theta<90^\circ$), $W$ remains
finite at the melting point, with its value corresponding to a shallow
attractive minimum of the disjoining potential. In response to a shear stress
parallel to the GB plane, GBs in PFC simulations exhibit coupled motion normal
to this plane, with a discontinuous change of the coupling factor as a function
of $\theta$ that reflects a transition between two coupling modes, and/or
sliding (shearing of the two grains). The coupling factor for the two coupling
modes is in excellent quantitative agreement with previous theoretical

  Astrophys",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201220690",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  FK Comae is a rapidly rotating magnetically active star, the light curve of
which is modulated by cool spots on its surface. It was the first star where
the ""flip-flop"" phenomenon was discovered. Since then, flip-flops in the spot
activity have been reported in many other stars.
  Therefore, it is of interest to perform a more thorough study of the
evolution of the spot activity in FK Com. In this study, we analyse 15 years of
photometric observations with two different time series analysis methods, with
a special emphasis on detecting flip-flop type events from the data.
  We apply the continuous period search and carrier fit methods on long-term
standard Johnson-Cousins V-observations from the years 1995--2010. The
observations were carried out with two automated photometric telescopes,
Phoenix-10 and Amadeus T7 located in Arizona.
  We identify complex phase behaviour in 6 of the 15 analysed data segments. We
identify five flip-flop events and two cases of phase jumps, where the phase
shift is \Delta \phi < 0.4. In addition we see two mergers of spot regions and
two cases where the apparent phase shifts are caused by spot regions drifting
with respect to each other. Furthermore we detect variations in the rotation
period corresponding to a differential rotation coefficient of |k|>0.031.
  The flip-flop cannot be interpreted as a single phenomenon, where the main
activity jumps from one active longitude to another. In some of our cases the
phase shifts can be explained by differential rotation: Two spot regions move
with different angular velocity and even pass each other. Comparison between
the methods show that the carrier fit utility is better in retrieving slow
evolution especially from a low amplitude light curve, while the continuous
period search is more sensitive in case of rapid changes.

novel electronic phenomenon. An example is the dc-resistivity which shows
metallic behaviour in the ab-plane, while the c-axis response is insulating. We
apply a model, originally formulated by Yang, Rice, and Zhang, to study the
resistivity in the pseudogap phase. This model is able to reproduce the
qualitative features of the resistivity, including the systematic deviations
from linear behaviour for the in-plane conductivity, and the insulating
behaviour along the c-axis. We compare this to the predictions of the arc model

in understanding the resistivity is the reconstruction of the Fermi surface,

mixture. In this context we analyze the fidelity as a function of the

which the statistics of the system becomes subpoissonian, poissonian and
superpoissonian. Finally, we calculate the Wigner function, allowing an

We analyse the effect of multiple paternity on genetic diversity using a model
in which the highly promiscuous marine snail Littorina saxatilis expands from a
mainland to colonise initially empty islands of an archipelago. Migrant females
carry a large number of eggs fertilised by 1 - 10 mates. We quantify the
genetic diversity of the population in terms of its heterozygosity: initially
during the transient colonisation process, and at long times when the
population has reached an equilibrium state with migration. During
colonisation, multiple paternity increases the heterozygosity by 10 - 300 % in
comparison with the case of single paternity. The equilibrium state, by
contrast, is less strongly affected: multiple paternity gives rise to 10 - 50 %
higher heterozygosity compared with single paternity. Further we find that far
from the mainland, new mutations spreading from the mainland cause bursts of
high genetic diversity separated by long periods of low diversity. This effect
is boosted by multiple paternity. We conclude that multiple paternity
facilitates colonisation and maintenance of small populations, whether or not
this is the main cause for the evolution of extreme promiscuity in Littorina
saxatilis.

secure BH measurement obtained with the observation of its nuclear H2O maser
disk. The kinematical data have been analyzed both with the classical method
based on the analysis of the rotation curves and with the new method developed
by us and based on spectroastrometry. The classical method indicates that the
gas disk rotates in the gravitational potential of an extended stellar mass
distribution and a spatially unresolved mass of (1.7 +- 0.2) 10^7 Msun,
concentrated within r < 7 pc. The new method is capable of probing gas rotation
at scales which are a factor ~3.5 smaller than those probed by the rotation
curve analysis. The dynamical mass spatially unresolved with the
spectroastrometric method is a factor ~2 smaller, 7.9 (+1.4 -1.1) 10^6 Msun
indicating that spectroastrometry has been able to spatially resolve the
nuclear mass distribution down to 2 pc scales. This unresolved mass is still a
factor ~4.5 larger than the BH mass measurement obtained with the H2O maser
emission indicating that it has not been possible to resolve the sphere of
influence of the BH. Based on literature data, this spatially unresolved
dynamical mass distribution is likely dominated by molecular gas and it has
been tentatively identified with the circum-nuclear torus which prevents a
direct view of the central BH in Circinus. This mass distribution, with a size
of ~2pc, is similar in shape to that of the star cluster of the Milky Way
suggesting that a molecular torus, forming stars at a high rate, might be the
earlier evolutionary stage of the nuclear star clusters which are common in
late type spirals.

Carrington Rotations 2096-2107 (April 2010 to March 2011) - the overlap
interval between HMI and the Michelson Doppler Investigation (MDI). HMI
magnetograms averaged over 720 seconds are first mapped into heliographic
coordinates. Strips from these maps are then cross-correlated to determine the
distances in latitude and longitude that the magnetic element pattern has
moved, thus providing meridional flow and differential rotation velocities for
each rotation of the Sun. Flow velocities were averaged for the overlap
interval and compared to results obtained from MDI data. This comparison
indicates that these HMI images are rotated counter-clockwise by 0.075 degrees
with respect to the Sun's rotation axis. The profiles indicate that HMI data
can be used to reliably measure these axisymmetric flow velocities to at least
within 5 degrees of the poles. Unlike the noisier MDI measurements, no evidence
of a meridional flow counter-cell is seen in either hemisphere with the HMI
measurements: poleward flow continues all the way to the poles. Slight
North-South asymmetries are observed in the meridional flow. These asymmetries
should contribute to the observed asymmetries in the polar fields and the
timing of their reversals.

dynamic environment where observations (e.g. the posture of a person) are

at a time and which may transition from one to another at any time. For this
setup, switching dynamic models have been suggested previously, mostly, for
linear and nonlinear dynamics in discrete time. Motivated by basic principles
of computations in the brain (dynamic, internal models) we suggest a model for
switching nonlinear differential equations. The switching process in the model
is implemented by a Hopfield network and we use parametric dynamic movement
primitives to represent arbitrary rhythmic motions. The model generates
observed dynamics by linearly interpolating the primitives weighted by the
switching variables and it is constructed such that standard filtering
algorithms can be applied. In two experiments with synthetic planar motion and
a human motion capture data set we show that inference with the unscented

these problems in the self-improving setting. Here, we have $n$ distributions
$\mathcal{D}_1, \ldots, \mathcal{D}_n$ of planar points. An input point set
$(p_1, \ldots, p_n)$ is generated by taking an independent sample $p_i$ from
each $\mathcal{D}_i$, so the input is distributed according to the product
$\mathcal{D} = \prod_i \mathcal{D}_i$. A self-improving algorithm repeatedly
gets inputs from the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ (which is a priori unknown),
and it tries to optimize its running time for $\mathcal{D}$. The algorithm uses
the first few inputs to learn salient features of the distribution
$\mathcal{D}$, before it becomes fine-tuned to $\mathcal{D}$. Let
$\text{OPTMAX}_\mathcal{D}$ (resp. $\text{OPTCH}_\mathcal{D}$) be the expected
depth of an \emph{optimal} linear comparison tree computing the maxima (resp.
convex hull) for $\mathcal{D}$. Our maxima algorithm eventually achieves
expected running time $O(\text{OPTMAX}_\mathcal{D} + n)$. Furthermore, we give
a self-improving algorithm for convex hulls with expected running time
$O(\text{OPTCH}_\mathcal{D} + n\log\log n)$.
  Our results require new tools for understanding linear comparison trees. In
particular, we convert a general linear comparison tree to a restricted version
that can then be related to the running time of our algorithms. Another
interesting feature is an interleaved search procedure to determine the
likeliest point to be extremal with minimal computation. This allows our
algorithms to be competitive with the optimal algorithm for $\mathcal{D}$.

noise due to finite photon counts and detector read noise is a major
contributor to uncertainty in flexion estimates, across a broad range of galaxy
signal-to-noise. This pixel noise also increases more rapidly as galaxy
signal-to-noise decreases than is found for shear estimates. We provide simple

gravitational backgrounds that may occur in string theory. The first background
is due to linear dilatons and the associated Kalb-Ramond field (axion) in four
non-compact space-time dimensions of the string, and can be described within
the framework of local effective lagrangians. The axion is linear in the time
coordinate of the Einstein frame and gives rise to a constant torsion which
couples to the fermion spin through a gravitational covariant derivative. This
leads to different energy-momentum dispersion relations for fermions and
anti-fermions and hence leptogenesis. The next two backgrounds go beyond the
local effective lagrangian framework. One is a stochastic (Lorentz Violating)
Finsler metric which again leads to different dispersion relations between
fermions and antifermions. The third background of primary interest is the one
due to populations of stochastically fluctuating point-like space-time defects
that can be encountered in string/brane theory (D0 branes). Only neutral matter
interacts non-trivially with these defects, as a consequence of charge
conservation. Hence, such a background singles out neutrinos among the Standard
Model excitations as the ones interacting predominantly with the defects. The
back-reaction of the defects on the space-time due to their interaction with
neutral matter results in stochastic Finsler-like metrics (similar to our
second background). On average, the stochastic fluctuations of the D0 brane
defects preserve Lorentz symmetry, but their variance is non-zero.
Interestingly, the particle/antiparticle asymmetry comes out naturally to
favour matter over antimatter in this third background, once the effects of the
kinematics of the scattering of the D branes with matter is incorporated.

solve the problem when we restrict attention to the long term average payoff.
When used by both players these assure the cooperative payoff for each of them.
Neither player can benefit by moving unilaterally any other strategy, i.e.
these are Nash equilibria. In addition, if a player uses instead an alternative
which decreases the opponent's payoff below the cooperative level, then his own
payoff is decreased as well. Thus, if we limit attention to the long term

sufficient condition for the efficient reconstruction of a nearly k-sparse
vector x in C^d from m linear measurements Phi x. It is desirable for m to be
small, and for Phi to support fast matrix-vector multiplication. In this work,
we give a randomized construction of RIP matrices Phi in C^{m x d}, preserving
the L_2 norms of all k-sparse vectors with distortion 1+eps, where the
matrix-vector multiply Phi x can be computed in nearly linear time. The number
of rows m is on the order of eps^{-2}klog dlog^2(klog d). Previous analyses of
constructions of RIP matrices supporting fast matrix-vector multiplies, such as
the sampled discrete Fourier matrix, required m to be larger by roughly a log k
factor.
  Supporting fast matrix-vector multiplication is useful for iterative recovery
algorithms which repeatedly multiply by Phi or Phi^*. Furthermore, our
construction, together with a connection between RIP matrices and the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma in [Krahmer-Ward, SIAM. J. Math. Anal. 2011],
implies fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings with asymptotically fewer rows
than previously known.
  Our approach is a simple twist on previous constructions. Rather than
choosing the rows for the embedding matrix to be rows sampled from some larger
structured matrix (such as the discrete Fourier transform or a random circulant
matrix), we instead choose each row of the embedding matrix to be a linear
combination of a small number of rows of the original matrix, with random sign
flips as coefficients. The main tool in our analysis is a recent bound for the
supremum of certain types of Rademacher chaos processes in

surface magnetic field strength and the magnetospheric scattering optical
depth. We find that the magnetar surface temperature near the peak of its
activity is 0.38 keV, corresponding to an emission area of 131 km^2 at a
distance of 2 kpc. The surface magnetic field strength determined
spectroscopically, B=2.2E14 G, is consistent with the dipole field strength
inferred from the source spin and spin down rate. We fit the stacked spectra of
129 very faint bursts with a modified blackbody model and find a temperature of
1.16 keV, corresponding to an emission area of 93 km^2. We also find an

nearly-perfect fluid. This collective behavior is probed experimentally by
two-particle azimuthal correlations, which are typically averaged over the
properties of one particle in each pair. In this Letter, we argue that much
additional information is contained in the detailed structure of the
correlation. In particular, the correlation matrix exhibits an approximate
factorization in transverse momentum, which is taken as a strong evidence for
the hydrodynamic picture, while deviations from the factorized form are taken
as a signal of intrinsic, ""nonflow"" correlations. We show that hydrodynamics in
fact predicts factorization breaking as a natural consequence of initial state
fluctuations and averaging over events. We derive the general inequality
relations that hold if flow dominates, and which are saturated if the matrix
factorizes. For transverse momenta up to 5 GeV, these inequalities are
satisfied in data, but not saturated. We find at least as large factorization
breaking in event-by-event ideal hydrodynamic calculations as in data, and
argue that this phenomenon opens a new window on the study of initial
fluctuations.

important for understanding mechanisms of protein folding and function. We
studied ensembles of bound and unbound conformations of six proteins to explore
their binding mechanisms and characterize the energy landscapes in implicit
solvent. First, results show that bound and unbound spectra often significantly
overlap. Moreover, the larger the overlap the smaller the RMSD between bound
and unbound conformational ensembles. Second, the analysis of the
unbound-to-bound changes points to conformational selection as the binding
mechanism for four of the proteins. Third, the center of the unbound spectrum
has a higher energy than the center of the corresponding bound spectrum of the
dimeric and multimeric states for most of the proteins. This suggests that the
unbound states often have larger entropy than the bound states considered
outside of the complex. Fourth, the exhaustively long minimization, making
small intra-rotamer adjustments, dramatically reduces the distance between the
centers of the bound and unbound spectra as well as the spectra extent. It
condenses unbound and bound energy levels into a thin layer at the bottom of
the energy landscape with the energy spacing that varies between 0.8-4.6 and
3.5-10.5 kcal/mol for the unbound and bound states correspondingly. At the same
time, the energy gap between the two lowest states in the full ensemble varies
between 0.9 and 12.1 kcal/mol. Finally, the analysis of protein energy
fluctuations showed that protein vibrations itself can excite the inter-state
transitions, thus supporting the conformational selection theory.

temperatures and non-thermal velocities as well as Doppler shifts with respect
to the ambient magnetic field. This method provides new results, as well as
independent test for previous measurements obtained with other techniques. Our
spectral data come from observations of a low latitude, on-disk coronal hole. A
potential field source surface model was used to calculate the angle between
the magnetic field lines and the line of sight for each spatial bin of the
observation. A fit was performed to determine the line widths and Doppler
shifts parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field. For each line width
component we derived parallel and perpendicular ion temperatures and
non-thermal velocities. The perpendicular ion temperature was cooler than
off-limb polar coronal hole measurements. The parallel ion temperature was
consistent with a uniform temperature of 1.8 +/- 0.2 x 10^{6} K for each ion.
Since parallel ion heating is expected to be weak, this ion temperature should
reflect the proton temperature. A comparison between our results and others
implies a large proton temperature gradient around 1.02 R_sun. The non-thermal
velocities are thought to be proportional to the amplitudes of various waves.
Our results for the perpendicular non-thermal velocity agree with Alfv\'en wave
amplitudes inferred from off-limb polar coronal hole line width measurements.
Our parallel non-thermal velocity results are consistent with slow magnetosonic
wave amplitudes inferred from Fourier analysis of time varying intensity
fluctuations. Doppler shift measurements yield outflows of ~5 km s^-1 for ions
formed over a broad temperature range. This differs from other studies which
found a strong Doppler shift dependence on formation temperature.

dimensionality reducing linear maps. First, consider the JL lemma which states
that for any set of n vectors in R there is a matrix A in R^{m x d} with m =
O(eps^{-2}log n) such that mapping by A preserves pairwise Euclidean distances
of these n vectors up to a 1 +/- eps factor. We show that there exists a set of
n vectors such that any such matrix A with at most s non-zero entries per
column must have s = Omega(eps^{-1}log n/log(1/eps)) as long as m <
O(n/log(1/eps)). This bound improves the lower bound of Omega(min{eps^{-2},
eps^{-1}sqrt{log_m d}}) by [Dasgupta-Kumar-Sarlos, STOC 2010], which only held
against the stronger property of distributional JL, and only against a certain
restricted class of distributions. Meanwhile our lower bound is against the JL
lemma itself, with no restrictions. Our lower bound matches the sparse
Johnson-Lindenstrauss upper bound of [Kane-Nelson, SODA 2012] up to an
O(log(1/eps)) factor.
  Next, we show that any m x n matrix with the k-restricted isometry property
(RIP) with constant distortion must have at least Omega(klog(n/k)) non-zeroes
per column if the number of the rows is the optimal value m = O(klog (n/k)),
and if k < n/polylog n. This improves the previous lower bound of Omega(min{k,
n/m}) by [Chandar, 2010] and shows that for virtually all k it is impossible to
have a sparse RIP matrix with an optimal number of rows.
  Lastly, we show that any oblivious distribution over subspace embedding
matrices with 1 non-zero per column and preserving all distances in a d
dimensional-subspace up to a constant factor with constant probability must
have at least Omega(d^2) rows. This matches one of the upper bounds in
[Nelson-Nguyen, 2012] and shows the impossibility of obtaining the best of both
of constructions in that work, namely 1 non-zero per column and \~O(d) rows.

learning algorithm is restricted to query points that are \emph{close} to
random examples drawn from the underlying distribution. The learning model is
intermediate between the PAC model (Valiant, 1984) and the PAC+MQ model (where
the queries are allowed to be arbitrary points).
  Membership query algorithms are not popular among machine learning
practitioners. Apart from the obvious difficulty of adaptively querying
labelers, it has also been observed that querying \emph{unnatural} points leads
to increased noise from human labelers (Lang and Baum, 1992). This motivates
our study of learning algorithms that make queries that are close to examples
generated from the data distribution.
  We restrict our attention to functions defined on the $n$-dimensional Boolean
hypercube and say that a membership query is local if its Hamming distance from
some example in the (random) training data is at most $O(\log(n))$. We show the
following results in this model:
  (i) The class of sparse polynomials (with coefficients in R) over $\{0,1\}^n$
is polynomial time learnable under a large class of \emph{locally smooth}
distributions using $O(\log(n))$-local queries. This class also includes the
class of $O(\log(n))$-depth decision trees.
  (ii) The class of polynomial-sized decision trees is polynomial time
learnable under product distributions using $O(\log(n))$-local queries.
  (iii) The class of polynomial size DNF formulas is learnable under the
uniform distribution using $O(\log(n))$-local queries in time
$n^{O(\log(\log(n)))}$.

ttbar system. The measurements are performed with the full Tevatron data set
recorded with the CDF II detector during ppbar collisions at sqrt(s) = 1.96
TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 9.4 fb^(-1). We measure the
asymmetry using the rapidity difference Delta-y=y_(t)-y_(tbar). Parton-level
results are derived, yielding an inclusive asymmetry of 0.164+/-0.047 (stat +
syst). We observe a linear dependence of AFB on the top-quark pair mass
M(ttbar) and the rapidity difference |Delta-y| at detector and parton levels.
Assuming the standard model, the probabilities to observe the measured values
or larger for the detector-level dependencies are 7.4*10^(-3) and 2.2*10^(-3)
for M(ttbar) and |Delta-y| respectively. Lastly, we study the dependence of the
asymmetry on the transverse momentum of the ttbar system at the detector level.
These results are consistent with previous lower-precision measurements and
provide additional quantification of the functional dependencies of the

corresponding redshift of light received from them can only be explained by an
expansion of the space between them and us. In this paper, for the presently
favored case of a universe without spatial curvature, it is shown that this
interpretation is restricted to comoving coordinates. It is proven by
construction that within the framework of general relativity other coordinates
exist in relation to which these phenomena can be explained by a motion of the
cosmic substrate across space, caused by an explosion like big bang or by
inflation preceding an almost big bang. At the place of an observer, this
motion occurs without any spatial expansion. It is shown that in these
""explosion coordinates"" the usual redshift comes about by a Doppler shift and a
subsequent gravitational shift. Making use of this interpretation, it can
easily be understood why in comoving coordinates light rays of short spatial
extensions expand and thus constitute an exemption from the rule that small
objects up to the size of the solar system or even galaxies do not participate
in the expansion of the universe. It is also discussed how the two
interpretations can be reconciled with each other.

subsequent formation of bars need to be distinguished to fully understand the
relationship between bars and environment. To this aim we derive the bar
fraction in three different environments ranging from the field to Virgo and
Coma clusters, covering an unprecedentedly large range of galaxy luminosities
(or, equivalently, stellar masses). We confirm that the fraction of barred
galaxies strongly depends on galaxy luminosity. We also show that the
difference between the bar fraction distributions as a function of galaxy
luminosity (and mass) in the field and Coma cluster are statistically
significant, with Virgo being an intermediate case. The fraction of barred
galaxies shows a maximum of about 50% at $M_r\,\simeq\,-20.5$ in clusters,
whereas the peak is shifted to $M_r\,\simeq\,-19$ in the field. We interpret
this result as a variation of the effect of environment on bar formation
depending on galaxy luminosity. We speculate that brighter disk galaxies are
stable enough against interactions to keep their cold structure, thus, the
interactions are able to trigger bar formation. For fainter galaxies the
interactions become strong enough to heat up the disks inhibiting bar formation
and even destroying the disks. Finally, we point out that the controversy
regarding whether the bar fraction depends on environment could be resolved by
taking into account the different luminosity ranges probed by the galaxy
samples studied so far.

the behavior of equivalent width, W(2796), and covering fraction, f_c, as a

the W(2796)-D plane (4.0 sigma); high-mass halos are found at higher D with
larger W(2796) compared to lower mass halos. On the W(2796)-D/Rvir plane, mass
segregation vanishes and we find W(2796) ~ (D/Rvir)^-2 (8.9 sigma); [2] higher

all D/Rvir; [3] f_c is constant with M_h over the range 10.7 < log(M_h/Msun) <
13.8 within a given D or D/Rvir. The combined results suggest that the MgII
absorbing CGM is self-similar with halo mass, even above log(M_h/Msun)~12,
where cold mode accretion is theoretically predicted to be quenched. If theory
is correct, either outflows or sub-halos must contribute to absorption in
high-mass halos such that low- and high-mass halos are observationally
indistinguishable using MgII absorption strength once impact parameter is
scaled by halo mass. Alternatively, the data may indicate that predictions of a
universal shut down of cold-mode accretion in high-mass halos may require
revision.

complicate the interpretation of the galaxy power spectrum. Here, we
demonstrate the method proposed by Hikage et al. (2012) to use complimentary
observations to directly constrain this effect on the data. We use catalogs of
Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) and photometric galaxies from the SDSS DR7 to
measure the redshift-space power spectrum of LRGs, the cross-correlation of
LRGs with the shapes of background photometric galaxies (galaxy-galaxy weak
lensing), and the projected cross-correlation of LRGs with photometric galaxies
having similar photometric redshifts to the LRG spectroscopic redshift. All of
these measurements use a reconstructed halo field. While we use the position of
each LRG for single LRG systems, we compare the measurements using different
halo-center proxies for multiple-LRG systems (4.5 per cent of all the halos):
the brightest LRG position (BLRG), the faintest LRG position (FLRG) and their
arithmetical mean position (Mean), respectively, in each system. We find
significant differences in the measured correlations of different centers,
showing consistent off-centering effects in the three observables. By comparing
the measurements with a halo model that treats the satellite photometric
galaxies as being distributed according to a generalized NFW profile, we find
that about 40 (70) per cent of BLRGs (FLRGs) are off-centered satellite
galaxies in the multiple-LRG systems. The satellite LRGs have typical
off-centering radius of about 400 kpc/h, and velocity dispersion of about 500
km/s in host halos with a mean mass of 1.6x10^14 Ms/h. We show that, if LRGs in
the single LRG systems have similar offsets, the residual FoG contamination in
the LRG power spectrum can be significant at k>0.1 h/Mpc, which may cause a
bias in cosmological parameters such as the neutrino mass.

Ultradeep Field program (IUDF10). Our sample contains a total of ~2600 galaxies
selected as B-dropout Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) in the HUDF and one of its
deep parallel fields, the HUDF09-2, as well as GOODS-North and South. This
sample is used to investigate the UV continuum slopes beta and Balmer break
colors (J_125-[4.5]) as a function of rest-frame optical luminosity. The [4.5]
filter is chosen to avoid potential contamination by strong rest-frame optical
emission lines. We find that galaxies at M_z<-21.5 (roughly corresponding to
L*[z~4]) are significantly redder than their lower luminosity counterparts. The
UV continuum slopes and the J_125-[4.5] colors are well correlated. The most
simple explanation for this correlation is that the dust reddening at these
redshifts is better described by an SMC-like extinction curve, rather than the
typically assumed Calzetti reddening. After correcting for dust, we find that
the galaxy population shows mean stellar population ages in the range 10^8.5 to
10^9 yr, with a dispersion of ~0.5 dex, and only weak trends as a function of
luminosity. In contrast to some results from the literature, we find that only
a small fraction of galaxies shows Balmer break colors which are consistent
with extremely young ages, younger than 100 Myr. Under the assumption of smooth
star-formation histories, this fraction is only 12-19% for galaxies at
M_z<-19.75. Our results are consistent with a gradual build-up of stars and
dust in galaxies at z>4, with only a small fraction of stars being formed in
short, intense bursts of star-formation.

extent is smaller in absolute terms in ETGs than in late-type galaxies, but
that the size distributions are similar once scaled by the galaxies
optical/stellar characteristic scale-lengths. Virgo cluster ETGs have less
extended molecular gas reservoirs than field counterparts. Approximately half
of ETGs have molecular gas surface brightness profiles that follow the stellar
light profile. These systems often have relaxed gas out to large radii,
suggesting they are unlikely to have had recent merger/accretion events. A
third of the sample galaxies show molecular gas surface brightness profiles
that fall off slower than the light, and sometimes show a truncation. We
suggest that ram pressure stripping and/or the presence of hot gas has
compressed/truncated the gas in these systems. The remaining galaxies have
rings, or composite profiles, that we argue can be caused by the effects of
bars. We investigated the kinematics of the molecular gas using
position-velocity diagrams, and compared the observed kinematics with dynamical
model predictions, and the observed stellar and ionised gas velocities. We
confirm that the molecular gas reaches beyond the turnover of the circular
velocity curve in ~70% of our CO-rich Atlas3D ETGs. In general we find that in
most galaxies the molecular gas is relaxed and dynamically cold. Molecular gas
is a better direct tracer of the circular velocity than the ionised gas,
justifying its use as a kinematic tracer for Tully-Fisher and similar analyses.

of orbital energy via tides, and mass loss during the giant phases; previous

largest-angle photometric calibration variations (dipole, quadrupole and a few
more modes, though not the monopole) are the most damaging, and 2) calibration

solutions are available with periods of $\sim11.6$, $\sim12.0$, $\sim12.4$, and
$\sim12.8$ days. From the possible orbital solutions, system masses of
$1.3-1.5\pm0.1\times10^{21}$ kg are found. These observations provide an
updated density for Quaoar of $2.7-5.0{g cm$^{-3}$}$. In all cases, Weywot's
orbit is eccentric, with possible values $\sim0.13-0.16$. We present a
reanalysis of the tidal orbital evolution of the Quoaor-Weywot system. We have
found that Weywot has probably evolved to a state of synchronous rotation, and
have likely preserved their initial inclinations over the age of the Solar
system. We find that for plausible values of the effective tidal dissipation
factor tides produce a very slow evolution of Weywot's eccentricity and
semi-major axis. Accordingly, it appears that Weywot's eccentricity likely did
not tidally evolve to its current value from an initially circular orbit.
Rather, it seems that some other mechanism has raised its eccentricity
post-formation, or Weywot formed with a non-negligible eccentricity.

scalar-tensor gravity as an alternative to dark matter. Motivated by chameleon,
symmetron and f(R)-gravity models, we studied a phenomenological scenario where
the scalar field has both a mass (i.e. interaction length) and a coupling
constant to the ordinary matter which scale with the local properties of the
considered astrophysical system. Methods. We analysed the feasibility of this
scenario using the modified gravitational potential obtained in its context and
applied it to the galactic and hot gas/stellar dynamics in galaxy clusters and
elliptical/spiral galaxies respectively. This is intended to be a first step in
assessing the viability of this new approach in the context of ""alternative
gravity"" models. Results. The main results are: 1. the velocity dispersion of
elliptical galaxies can be fitted remarkably well by the suggested scalar
field, with model significance similar to a classical Navarro-Frenk-White dark
halo profile; 2. the analysis of the stellar dynamics and the gas equilibrium
in elliptical galaxies has shown that the scalar field can couple with ordinary
matter with different strengths (different coupling constants) producing and/or
depending on the different clustering state of matter components; 3. elliptical
and spiral galaxies, combined with clusters of galaxies, show evident
correlations among theory parameters which suggest the general validity of our
results at all scales and a way toward a possible unification of the theory for
all types of gravitational systems we considered. All these results demonstrate
that the proposed scalar field scenario can work fairly well as an alternative
to dark matter.

derive from an action principle, it is nevertheless possible to construct
classical actions when the dissipative terms are switched off. In this note we
undertake a systematic exploration of such constructions from an effective
field theory approach and argue for the existence of non-trivial second order
non-dissipative hydrodynamics involving pure energy-momentum transport. We find
these fluids to be characterized by five second-order transport coefficients
based on the effective action (a three parameter family is Weyl invariant). On
the other hand since all flows of such fluids are non-dissipative, they entail
zero entropy production; one can therefore understand them using the entropy
current formalism which has provided much insight into hydrodynamic transport.
An analysis of the most general stress tensor with zero entropy production
however turns out to give a seven parameter family of non-dissipative
hydrodynamics (a four parameter sub-family being Weyl invariant). The
non-dissipative fluids derived from the effective action approach are a special
case of the fluid dynamics constrained by conservation of the entropy current.
We speculate on the reasons for the mismatch and potential limitations of the
effective action approach.

dependence of the physical properties of galaxy populations at redshift 2 on
metal-line cooling and feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei
(AGN). We find that if the sub-grid feedback from star formation is implemented
kinetically, the feedback is only efficient if the initial wind velocity
exceeds a critical value. This critical velocity increases with galaxy mass and
also if metal-line cooling is included. This suggests that radiative losses
quench the winds if their initial velocity is too low. If the feedback is
efficient, then the star formation rate is inversely proportional to the amount
of energy injected per unit stellar mass formed (which is proportional to the
initial mass loading for a fixed wind velocity). This can be understood if the
star formation is self-regulating, i.e. if the star formation rate (and thus
the gas fraction) increase until the outflow rate balances the inflow rate.
Feedback from AGN is efficient at high masses, while increasing the initial
wind velocity with gas pressure or halo mass allows one to generate galaxy-wide
outflows at all masses. Matching the observed galaxy mass function requires
efficient feedback. In particular, the predicted faint-end slope is too steep
unless we resort to highly mass loaded winds for low-mass objects. Such
efficient feedback from low-mass galaxies (M_* << 10^10 Msun) also reduces the
discrepancy with the observed specific star formation rates, which are higher
than predicted unless the feedback transitions from highly efficient to
inefficient just below the observed stellar mass range.

two new pulsating He-core WDs, in addition to the prototype SDSS

that such CP studies may become an important avenue for understanding CP. In
this paper, we make several suggestions to try to clarify the role of new
physics in these results. We propose that the enhancement needed in the
Standard Model to attribute the observed CP violation in D to two pseudoscalar
modes may not operate for inclusive final states where asymmetries will likely
approximate the quark level expectation. Experimentally testing this principle
requires a search for CP asymmetries in final states containing K and K-bar
with a total energy of less than M_D. We also propose that CP asymmetries may
be enhanced in modes where the tree is color suppressed. In particular, the
final state rho0 rho0 is of special interest; similarly Ds-> rho0 K+ and rho0
K*+ likewise appear interesting. We discuss how isospin symmetry yields
observables sensitive to certain classes of new physics and suppressed in the
Standard Model. Some modes considered in this context are D-> pi pi, rho pi,
rho rho as well as Ds-> K* pi. We also consider how such analysis may
eventually be supplemented by information about the weak phases in D0 decay. In
order to obtain this information experimentally, we consider various methods
for preparing an initial state which is a quantum mechanical mixture of D0 and
D0-bar. This may be done through the use of natural D0 D0-bar oscillations;
observing D0-mesons which arise from Bd or Bs mesons which themselves are
oscillating or from quantum correlations in D0 pairs which arise from either
psi"" decay or B-meson decay. Observing CP violation in the magnitudes of decay
amplitudes should be within the capability of experiments in the near future
however obtaining the weak phases through the methods we discuss will likely
require future generations of machines.

the percolation thresholds, i. e., the critical packing fraction for

with the wall separation $L_{z}$ in a continuous but non-monotonic way,
$\eta_{c}(L_{z}\rightarrow\infty)=\eta_{c}^{\text{3D}}$. We also report results

obtained from a finite-size analysis involving the cluster-size distribution

CDFN. Stacking the undetected sources also reveals a significant X-ray signal.
Investigating the X-ray detection rate and stacked flux versus the IR excess
parameter (i.e. SFRtotal/SFRUV,corr), we find no strong evidence for an
increased X-ray detection rate, or a harder X-ray spectrum in IR Excess sBzKs.
This is particularly the case when one accounts for the strong correlation
between the IR excess parameter and the bolometric IR luminosity (LIR), e.g.
when controlling for LIR, the IR Non-Excess sBzKs show a detection rate at
least as high. While both direct detections and stacking suggest that the AGN
fraction in sBzK galaxies is high, there is no clear evidence for widespread
Compton thick activity in either the sBzK population generally, or the IR
Excess sBzK subsample. The very hard X-ray signal obtained for the latter in
earlier work was most likely contaminated by a few hard X-ray sources now
directly detected in deeper X-ray data. The X-ray detection fraction of passive
BzK galaxies in our sample is if anything higher than that of sBZKs, so there
is no evidence for coeval black hole growth and star formation from X-ray
analysis of the BzK populations. Because increased AGN activity in the IR
excess population is not indicated by our X-ray analysis, it appears that the
bulk of the IR Excess sBzK population are luminous star-forming galaxies whose
SFRs are either overestimated at 24 microns, underestimated in the UV, or both.
This conclusion reinforces recent results from Herschel which show similar
effects.

the fireball magnetization is underestimated by up to two orders of magnitude.
This discrepancy is especially large in the sub-relativistic reverse shock

were detected. We provide new analytic estimates of the reverse shock emission

galaxies in the first billion years of cosmic time. First, we demonstrate that
our model reproduces the basic statistical properties of the observed
Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) population at z = 6 - 8, including the evolving
ultra-violet (UV) luminosity function (LF), the stellar-mass density (SMD), and
the average specific star-formation rates (sSFR) of LBGs with M_{UV} < -18 (AB
mag). Encouraged by this success we present predictions for the behaviour of
fainter LBGs extending down to M_{UV} <= -15 (as will be probed with the James
Webb Space Telescope) and have interrogated our simulations to try to gain
insight into the physical drivers of the observed population evolution. We find
that mass growth due to star formation in the mass-dominant progenitor builds
up about 90% of the total z ~ 6 LBG stellar mass, dominating over the mass
contributed by merging throughout this era. Our simulation suggests that the
apparent ""luminosity evolution"" depends on the luminosity range probed: the
steady brightening of the bright end of the LF is driven primarily by genuine
physical luminosity evolution and arises due to a fairly steady increase in the
UV luminosity (and hence star-formation rates) in the most massive LBGs.
However, at fainter luminosities the situation is more complex, due in part to
the more stochastic star-formation histories of lower-mass objects; at this
end, the evolution of the UV LF involves a mix of positive and negative
luminosity evolution (as low-mass galaxies temporarily brighten then fade)
coupled with both positive and negative density evolution (as new low-mass
galaxies form, and other low-mass galaxies are consumed by merging). We also
predict the average sSFR of LBGs should rise from sSFR = 4.5 Gyr^-1 at z = 6 to
about 11 Gyr^-1 by z = 9.

Additionally, two other GBS sources are resolved binary companions to Tycho-2
stars where both components are separately detected in X-rays. Most of these
are likely to be real matches, but we identify nine objects with large and
significant X-ray to optical offsets as either detections of resolved binary
companions or chance alignments. We collate known spectral types for these
objects, and also examine 2MASS colors, variability information from the
All-Sky Automated Survey (ASAS), and X-ray hardness ratios for the brightest
objects. Nearly a third of the stars are found to be optically variable,
divided roughly evenly between irregular variations and periodic modulations.
All fall among the softest objects identified by the GBS. The sample forms a
very mixed selection, ranging in spectral class from O9 to M3. In some cases
the X-ray emission appears consistent with normal coronal emission from
late-type stars, or wind emission from early-types, but the sample also

if many but not necessarily all of these points are contained in a
$d$-dimensional subspace $T$ can we find it? The points contained in $T$ are
called {\em inliers} and the remaining points are {\em outliers}. This problem
has received considerable attention in computer science and in statistics. Yet
efficient algorithms from computer science are not robust to {\em adversarial}
outliers, and the estimators from robust statistics are hard to compute in high
dimensions.
  Are there algorithms for subspace recovery that are both robust to outliers
and efficient? We give an algorithm that finds $T$ when it contains more than a
$\frac{d}{n}$ fraction of the points. Hence, for say $d = n/2$ this estimator
is both easy to compute and well-behaved when there are a constant fraction of
outliers. We prove that it is Small Set Expansion hard to find $T$ when the
fraction of errors is any larger, thus giving evidence that our estimator is an
{\em optimal} compromise between efficiency and robustness.

other areas including small set expansion, matroid theory and functional
analysis that we make use of here.

\geq 3$. If the inaccessible part of the boundary satisfies a (conformal)
flatness condition in one direction, we show that this problem reduces to the
invertibility of a broken geodesic ray transform. In Euclidean space, sets
satisfying the flatness condition include parts of cylindrical sets, conical
sets, and surfaces of revolution. We prove local uniqueness in the Calderon
problem with partial data in admissible geometries, and global uniqueness under
an additional concavity assumption. This work unifies two earlier approaches to
this problem (\cite{KSU} and \cite{I}) and extends both. The proofs are based
on improved Carleman estimates with boundary terms, complex geometrical optics
solutions involving reflected Gaussian beam quasimodes, and invertibility of
(broken) geodesic ray transforms. This last topic raises questions of
independent interest in integral geometry.

shows that up to a universal constant all moments of the norm of a linear

input into a concise lower-dimensional representation via a linear
transformation. Such sketches have seen a wide range of applications including
norm estimation over data streams, compressed sensing, and distributed
computing. In almost any realistic setting, however, a linear sketch faces the
possibility that its inputs are correlated with previous evaluations of the
sketch. Known techniques no longer guarantee the correctness of the output in
the presence of such correlations. We therefore ask: Are linear sketches
inherently non-robust to adaptively chosen inputs? We give a strong affirmative
answer to this question. Specifically, we show that no linear sketch
approximates the Euclidean norm of its input to within an arbitrary
multiplicative approximation factor on a polynomial number of adaptively chosen
inputs. The result remains true even if the dimension of the sketch is d = n -
o(n) and the sketch is given unbounded computation time. Our result is based on
an algorithm with running time polynomial in d that adaptively finds a
distribution over inputs on which the sketch is incorrect with constant
probability. Our result implies several corollaries for related problems
including lp-norm estimation and compressed sensing. Notably, we resolve an
open problem in compressed sensing regarding the feasibility of l2/l2-recovery
guarantees in the presence of computationally bounded adversaries.

the inverse of the star-discrepancy $n^*(s,\ve)$ satisfies the upper bound
$n^*(s,\ve) \leq c_{\mathrm{abs}} s \ve^{-2}$. This is equivalent to the fact
that for any $N$ and $s$ there exists a set of $N$ points in $[0,1]^s$ whose
star-discrepancy is bounded by $c_{\mathrm{abs}} s^{1/2} N^{-1/2}$. The proof
is based on the observation that a random point set satisfies the desired
discrepancy bound with positive probability. In the present paper we prove an
applied version of this result, making it applicable for computational

stated) number $c(q)$ such that the star-discrepancy of a random set of $N$

demonstrated that reconnection diffusion is an efficient process to remove the
magnetic flux excess during the build up of a rotationally supported disk. This
process is induced by fast reconnection of the magnetic fields in a turbulent
flow. In a similar numerical study, Seifried et al. (2012) concluded that
reconnection diffusion or any other non-ideal MHD effects would not be
necessary and turbulence shear alone would provide a natural way to build up a
rotating disk without requiring magnetic flux loss. Their conclusion was based
on the fact that the mean mass-to-flux ratio ({\mu}) evaluated over a spherical
region with a radius much larger than the disk is nearly constant in their
models. In this letter we compare the two sets of simulations and show that
this averaging over large scales can mask significant real increases of {\mu}
in the inner regions where the disk is built up. We demonstrate that
turbulence-induced reconnection diffusion of the magnetic field happens in the
initial stages of the disk formation in the turbulent envelope material that is
accreting. Our analysis is suggestive that reconnection diffusion is present in
both sets of simulations and provides a simple solution for the ""magnetic

coordinate and in momentum space, by means of one-and two-body densities and
momentum distributions. In this contribution we discuss one- and two-body
momentum distributions across a wide range of nuclei and their common features
which can be ascribed to the presence of short range correlations. Calculations
for few-body nuclei, namely 3He and 4He, have been performed using exact wave
functions obtained with Argonne nucleon-nucleon interactions, while the linked
cluster expansion technique is used for medium-heavy nuclei. The center of mass
motion of a nucleon-nucleon pair in the nucleus, embedded in the full two-body
momentum distribution n_NN(krel,KCM), is shown to exhibit the universal
behavior predicted by the two-nucleon correlation model, in which the
nucleon-nucleon pair moves inside the nucleus as a deuteron in a mean-field.
Moreover, the deuteron-like spin-isospin (ST)=(10) contribution to the pn
two-body momentum distribution is obtained, and shown to exactly scale to the
deuteron momentum distribution. Universality of correlations in two-body
distributions is cast onto the one-body distribution n(k1), obtained by
integration of the two-body n_NN(k1, k2): in particular, the high momentum part
of n(k1) exhibits the same pattern for all considered nuclei, in favor of a
universal character of the short range structure of the nuclear wave function.
Perspectives of this work, namely the calculation of reactions involving light
and complex nuclei with realistic wave functions and effects of Final State
Interactions (FSI), investigated by means of distorted momentum distributions
within the Glauber multiple scattering approach, are eventually discussed.

resolution, high contrast relative to non-targeted tissues, depth-independent
penetration into tissue, lack of harm to the organism under study, and low
cost. Because no existing molecular imaging modality is ideal for all purposes,
new imaging approaches are needed. Here we demonstrate a novel molecular
imaging approach, called nanodiamond imaging, that uses nanodiamonds containing
nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers as an imaging agent, and image nanodiamond
targets in pieces of chicken breast. Nanodiamonds can be tagged with
biologically active molecules so they bind to specific receptors; their
distribution can then be quantified in-vivo via optically-detected magnetic
resonance of the NVs. In effect, we are demonstrating Optically-Detected
Functional-Electron-Spin-Resonance-Imaging, OD-f-ESRI. By combining optical
detection with magnetic resonance, nanodiamond imaging achieves high
sensitivity and high spatial resolution. It is absent of the complications of
ionizing radiation, and the cost should be similar to all-optical imaging.
Because nanodiamond imaging is limited by the depth of optical penetration into
tissue to depths of a few cm, nanodiamond imaging should open up new avenues of
investigation for applications where high depth penetration is not required,
such as in small-animal imaging, tumor margin imaging, sentinel lymph node

There is a well-known issue with low mass (M <<0.8 M_sun) stars (in cases where
the mass and radius measurement uncertainties are smaller than two or three
percent) where the measured radii are almost always 5 to 15 percent larger than
expected from evolutionary models, i.e. the measured radii are all above the
model isochrones in a mass-radius plane. In contrast, the two stars in KIC
6131659 were found to sit on the same theoretical isochrone in the mass-radius
plane. Until recently, all of the well-studied eclipsing binaries with low-mass
stars had periods less than about three days. The stars in such systems may
have been inflated by high levels of stellar activity induced by tidal effects
in these close binaries. KIC 6131659 shows essentially no evidence of enhanced
stellar activity, and our measurements support the hypothesis that the unusual
mass-radius relationship observed in most low-mass stars is influenced by
strong magnetic activity created by the rapid rotation of the stars in
tidally-locked, short-period systems. Finally, using short cadence data, we
show that KIC 6131657 has one of the smallest measured non-zero eccentricities

determining the star formation histories of low mass dwarf galaxies. We include
a wide range of physical effects, including metal cooling, molecular hydrogen
formation and cooling, photoionization and photodissociation from a
metagalactic background, a simple prescription for self-shielding, star
formation, and a simple model for supernova driven energetic feedback. We carry
out simulations excluding each major effect in turn. We find that reionization
is primarily responsible for expelling most of the gas in our simulations, but
that supernova feedback is required to disperse the dense, cold gas in the core
of the halo. Moreover, we show that the timing of reionization can produce an
order of magnitude difference in the final stellar mass of the system. For our
full physics run with reionization at z=9, we find a stellar mass of about 10^5
Msun at z=0, and a mass-to-light ratio within the half-light radius of
approximately 130 Msun/Lsun, consistent with observed low-luminosity dwarfs.
However, the resulting median stellar metallicity is 0.06 Zsun, considerably
larger than observed systems. In addition, we find star formation is truncated
between redshifts 4 and 7, at odds with the observed late time star formation
in isolated dwarf systems but in agreement with Milky Way ultrafaint dwarf
spheroidals. We investigate the efficacy of energetic feedback in our simple
thermal-energy driven feedback scheme, and suggest that it may still suffer
from excessive radiative losses, despite reaching stellar particle masses of

best-fit orbits are mutually crossing - a scenario that is only dynamically
feasible if the planets are protected from close encounters by the effects of
mutual mean motion resonance. Our simulations reveal that the best fit orbits

surrounded by much larger regions of extreme instability. As such, we show that
the planets are only feasible if they are currently trapped in mutual

the 4:3 resonance in the case of HD 200964 b and c. In both cases, the region

Although numerous advancements of such sources have been made, it remains a
challenge to create a highly compact, robust platform capable of producing
femtosecond pulses over a wide range of wavelengths, durations, and repetition
rates. Recent observations of frequency comb generation via cascaded parametric
oscillation in microresonators11 suggest a path for achieving this goal. Here
we investigate the temporal and spectral properties of parametric combs
generated in silicon-nitride microresonators and observe a transition to
passive modelocking of the comb consistent with soliton-pulse formation,
resulting in the generation of 160-fs pulses at a 99-GHz repetition rate. This
platform offers the prospect of producing pulses from 10 fs to a few ps at
repetition rates from 10 GHz to > 1 THz and over a wavelength range of 0.8 - 6

goal here is to make the two channels identical by mixing with some other
channels with minimal mixing probabilities. This quantifies how much one

between the two mixing probabilities allows one channel to be more preserved

observations in 2009 and 2011 to measure improved physical properties of the
binary star. Each set of light curves, including the 2008 data given by
\cCakirli et al., was simultaneously analyzed with the previously published
radial-velocity curves using the Wilson-Devinney binary code. The conspicuous
seasonal light variations of the system are satisfactorily modelled by a
two-spot model with one starspot on each component and by changes of the spot
parameters with time. Based on 23 eclipse timings calculated from the synthetic
model and one ephemeris epoch, an orbital period study of NSVS 02502726 reveals
that the period has experienced a continuous decrease of $-5.9\times10^{-7}$ d
yr$^{-1}$ or a sinusoidal variation with a period and semi-amplitude of 2.51
yrs and 0.0011 d, respectively. The timing variations could be interpreted as
either the light-travel-time effect due to the presence of an unseen third
body, or as the combination of this effect and angular momentum loss via
magnetic stellar wind braking. Individual masses and radii of both components
are determined to be $M_1$=0.689$\pm$0.016 M$_\odot$, $M_2$=0.341$\pm$0.009

(0.763$\pm$0.007 R$_\odot$). We compared the physical parameters presented in
this paper with current low-mass stellar models and found that the measured
values of the primary star are best fitted to a 79-Myr isochrone. The primary
is in good agreement with the empirical mass-radius relation from low-mass

received a lot of attention recently and play an important role in constructing
PRGs for the natural class of polynomial threshold functions. In spite of the

These type1 AGNs span three orders of magnitude in continuum luminosity. We

while the significant deviations of the slopes for [NII] 6583, [OII] 3727,

either the ionization potential or the critical density. We show that a
combination of 50% variations in continuum near 5100A and a log-normal
distribution of observed luminosity can naturally reproduce a constant Baldwin
effect slope of -0.2 for all narrow lines. The variations of the continuum
could be due to variability, intrinsic anisotropic emission, or an inclination

collisions, a sizable strength of electric field directed from Au nucleus to Cu
nucleus is generated in the overlapping region, because of the difference in
the number of electric charges between the two nuclei. This electric field
would induce an electric current in the matter created after the collision,
which result in a dipole deformation of the charge distribution. The directed
flow parameters $v_1^{\pm}$ of charged particles turn out to be sensitive to
the charge dipole and provide us with information about electric conductivity
of the quark gluon plasma.

GRB classification. We systematically derive these parameters to find that most
short GRBs are likely not ""tip-of-iceberg"" of long GRBs. However, one needs to
be cautious if a short GRB has a relatively small $f$ (e.g. $f<1.5$), since the
chance for an intrinsically long GRB to appear as a ""disguised"" short GRB is
higher. Based on avaialble data, we quantify the probability of a disguised

dominant gas inflow or outflow with respect to gas locked up into long-lived
stars and remnants. For an assigned empirical differential oxygen abundance
distribution, which can be linearly fitted, a family of theoretical curves is
built up with assigned prescriptions. For curves with increasing cut parameter,
the gas mass fraction locked up into long-lived stars and remnants is found to
attain a maximum and then decrease towards zero as the flow tends to infinity,
while the remaining parameters show a monotonic trend. The theoretical integral
oxygen abundance distribution is also expressed. An application is performed to
the empirical distribution deduced from two different samples of disk stars,
for both the thin and the thick disk. The constraints on formation and
evolution are discussed in the light of the model. The evolution is tentatively
subdivided into four stages, A, F, C, E. The empirical distribution related to
any stage is fitted by all curves for a wide range of the cut parameter. The F
stage may safely be described by a steady inflow regime, implying a flat
theoretical distribution, in agreement with the results of hydrodynamical
simulations. Finally, (1) the change of fractional mass due to the extension of
the linear fit to the empirical distribution, towards both the (undetected)
low-metallicity and high-metallicity tail, is evaluated and (2) the idea of a
thick disk-thin disk collapse is discussed, in the light of the model.

with different intrinsic directionality is discussed in this study. Similar to
single motor movement, cargo steps forward and backward along microtubule
stochastically. Recent experiments found that, cargo transportation by two
motor species has a memory, it does not change its direction as frequently as
expected, which means that its forward and backward step rates depends on its
previous motion trajectory. By assuming cargo has only the least memory, i.e.
its step direction depends only on the direction of its last step, two cases of
cargo motion are detailed analyzed in this study: {\bf (I)} cargo motion under
constant external load; and {\bf (II)} cargo motion in one fixed optical trap.
Due to the existence of memory, for the first case, cargo can keep moving in
the same direction for a long distance. For the second case, the cargo will
oscillate in the trap. The oscillation period decreases and the oscillation
amplitude increases with the motor forward step rates, but both of them
decrease with the trap stiffness. The most likely location of cargo, where the
probability of finding the oscillated cargo is maximum, may be the same as or
may be different with the trap center, which depends on the step rates of the
two motor species. Meanwhile, if motors are robust, i.e. their forward to
backward step rate ratios are high, there may be two such most likely
locations, located on the two sides of the trap center respectively. The
probability of finding cargo in given location, the probability of cargo in
forward/backward motion state, and various mean first passage times of cargo to
give location or given state are also analyzed.

localization is established by the interferences through different channels of

the enhanced high-order above-threshold dissociation of heavier isotopes, the
interference maxima gradually become in phase with growing mass and ultimately

  using Fuzzy Analogy","5 pages,5 figures","Journal of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering,2010",,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the significant objectives of software engineering community is to use
effective and useful models for precise calculation of effort in software cost
estimation. The existing techniques cannot handle the dataset having
categorical variables efficiently including the commonly used analogy method.
Also, the project attributes of cost estimation are measured in terms of
linguistic values whose imprecision leads to confusion and ambiguity while
explaining the process. There are no definite set of models which can
efficiently handle the dataset having categorical variables and endure the
major hindrances such as imprecision and uncertainty without taking the
classical intervals and numeric value approaches. In this paper, a new approach
based on fuzzy logic, linguistic quantifiers and analogy based reasoning is
proposed to enhance the performance of the effort estimation in software
projects dealing with numerical and categorical data. The performance of this
proposed method illustrates that there is a realistic validation of the results
while using historical heterogeneous dataset. The results were analyzed using
the Mean Magnitude Relative Error (MMRE) and indicates that the proposed method
can produce more explicable results than the methods which are in vogue.

Proc",,"10.1109/TSP.2013.2271480",,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the scenario in which multiple sensors send spatially correlated
data to a fusion center (FC) via independent Rayleigh-fading channels with
additive noise. Assuming that the sensor data is sparse in some basis, we show
that the recovery of this sparse signal can be formulated as a compressive
sensing (CS) problem. To model the scenario in which the sensors operate with
intermittently available energy that is harvested from the environment, we
propose that each sensor transmits independently with some probability, and
adapts the transmit power to its harvested energy. Due to the probabilistic
transmissions, the elements of the equivalent sensing matrix are not Gaussian.
Besides, since the sensors have different energy harvesting rates and different
sensor-to-FC distances, the FC has different receive signal-to-noise ratios
(SNRs) for each sensor. This is referred to as the inhomogeneity of SNRs. Thus,
the elements of the sensing matrix are also not identically distributed. For
this unconventional setting, we provide theoretical guarantees on the number of
measurements for reliable and computationally efficient recovery, by showing
that the sensing matrix satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), under
reasonable conditions. We then compute an achievable system delay under an
allowable mean-squared-error (MSE). Furthermore, using techniques from large
deviations theory, we analyze the impact of inhomogeneity of SNRs on the
so-called k-restricted eigenvalues, which governs the number of measurements
required for the RIP to hold. We conclude that the number of measurements
required for the RIP is not sensitive to the inhomogeneity of SNRs, when the
number of sensors n is large and the sparsity of the sensor data (signal) k
grows slower than the square root of n. Our analysis is corroborated by
extensive numerical results.

establish a connection to a class of stochastic optimal control problems
concerned with sequential stopping times. A weak dynamic programming principle
(DPP) is then proposed, which characterizes the set of initial states that
admit a control enabling the process to execute the desired maneuver with
probability no less than some pre-specified value. The proposed DPP comprises
auxiliary value functions defined in terms of discontinuous payoff functions. A
concrete instance of the use of this novel DPP in the case of diffusion
processes is also presented. In this case, we establish that the aforementioned
set of initial states can be characterized as the level set of a discontinuous
viscosity solution to a sequence of partial differential equations, for which
the first one has a known boundary condition, while the boundary conditions of
the subsequent ones are determined by the solutions to the preceding steps.
Finally, the generality and flexibility of the theoretical results are

exhibits growth oscillations, until it bursts completing its function. Up till
now, the mechanism behind the periodic character of the growth has not been
fully understood. An attempt to understand these oscillations lead us to an
attractive scenario: We show that the mechanism of pressure-induced symmetry
frustration occuring in the wall at the perimeter of cylindrical and
approximately hemispherical parts of a growing pollen cell, together with the
addition of cell wall material, suffices to release and sustain mechanical
self-oscillations and cell extension in pollen tubes. At the transition zone
where symmetry frustration occurs and one cannot distinguish either of the
involved symmetries, a kind of 'entangled state' appears where either single or
both symmetry(ies) can be realized by the system. We anticipate that
testifiable predictions made by the model may deliver, after calibration, a new
tool to estimate turgor pressure from oscillation period of the growing cell.
Since the mechanical principles apply to all turgor regulated walled cells
including those of plant, fungal and bacterial origin, the relevance of this
work is not limited to the case of the pollen tube.

studies, but testing of several phenotype traits aggravates the grand challenge
of association studies, that of multiple testing. Several methods have recently
been proposed for testing jointly all traits in a high-dimensional vector of
phenotypes, with prospect of increased power to detect small effects that would
be missed if tested individually. However, the methods have rarely been
compared to the extent of enabling assessment of their relative merits and
setting up guidelines on which method to use, and how to use it. We compare the
methods on simulated data and with a real metabolomics data set comprising 137
highly correlated variables and approximately 550,000 SNPs.
  Applying the methods to genome-wide data with hundreds of thousands of
markers inevitably requires division of the problem into manageable parts
facilitating parallel processing, parts corresponding to individual genetic
variants, pathways, or genes, for example. Here we utilize a straightforward
formulation according to which the genome is divided into blocks of nearby
correlated genetic markers, tested jointly for association with the phenotypes.
This formulation is computationally feasible, reduces the number of tests, and
lets the methods take advantage of combining information over several
correlated variables not only on the phenotype side, but also on the genotype
side.
  Our experiments show that canonical correlation analysis has higher power
than alternative methods, while remaining computationally tractable for routine
use in the GWAS setting, provided the number of samples is sufficient compared
to the numbers of phenotype and genotype variables tested. Sparse canonical
correlation analysis and regression models with latent confounding factors show
promising performance when the number of samples is small.

is to optimize some function of the sum of a set of random variables. The
difficulty is mainly due to the fact that the probability distribution of the
sum is the convolution of a set of distributions, which is not an easy
objective function to work with. To tackle this difficulty, we introduce the
Poisson approximation technique. The technique is based on the Poisson
approximation theorem discovered by Le Cam, which enables us to approximate the
distribution of the sum of a set of random variables using a compound Poisson
distribution.
  We first study the expected utility maximization problem introduced recently
[Li and Despande, FOCS11]. For monotone and Lipschitz utility functions, we
obtain an additive PTAS if there is a multidimensional PTAS for the
multi-objective version of the problem, strictly generalizing the previous
result.
  For the stochastic bin packing problem (introduced in [Kleinberg, Rabani and
Tardos, STOC97]), we show there is a polynomial time algorithm which uses at
most the optimal number of bins, if we relax the size of each bin and the
overflow probability by eps.
  For stochastic knapsack, we show a 1+eps-approximation using eps extra
capacity, even when the size and reward of each item may be correlated and
cancelations of items are allowed. This generalizes the previous work [Balghat,
Goel and Khanna, SODA11] for the case without correlation and cancelation. Our
algorithm is also simpler. We also present a factor 2+eps approximation

paramagnetic states for Ca$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$RuO$_{4}$ in $0.5\leq x \leq 2$
within random phase approximation on the basis of an effective Ru $t_{2g}$
orbital Hubbard model. We find that several modes of spin fluctuation around
$\boldq=(0,0)$ and $\boldq\sim(0.797\pi,0)$ are strongly enhanced for the model
of $x=0.5$. This enhancement arises from the increase of the corresponding
susceptibilities for the $d_{xy}$ orbital due to the rotation-induced
modifications of the electronic structure for this orbital (i.e., the
flattening of the bandwidth and the increase of the density of state near the
Fermi level). We also find that the ferromagnetic spin fluctuation becomes
stronger for a special model than for the model of $x=0.5$, while the
competition between the modes of spin fluctuation at $\boldq=(0,0)$ and around
$\boldq\sim (\pi,0)$ is weaker for the special model; in this special model,
the van Hove singularity (vHs) for the $d_{xy}$ orbital is located on the Fermi
level. These results indicate that the location of the vHs for the $d_{xy}$
orbital, which is controlled by substitution of Ca for Sr, is a parameter to
control this competition. We propose that the spin fluctuations for the
$d_{xy}$ orbital around $\boldq=(0,0)$ and $\boldq\sim (\pi,0)$ play an
important role in the electronic states around $x=0.5$ other than the
criticality approaching the usual Mott transition where all electrons are
localized.

address the question to which extent the most commonly used subtraction

commonly discussed observables at present: single inclusive jet distributions,
dijet asymmetry and azimuthal distributions. We consider two different
background subtraction methods, an area-based one implemented through the
FastJet pack- age and a pedestal subtraction method, that resemble the ones
used by the experimental collaborations at the LHC. We also analyze different
ways of defining the optimal parame- ters in the second method. We use a toy
model that easily allows variations of the background characteristics: average
background level and fluctuations and azimuthal structure, but cross- checks
are also done with a Monte Carlo simulator. Furthermore, we consider the
influence of quenching using Q-PYTHIA on the dijet observables with the
different background subtrac- tion methods and, additionally, we examine the
missing momentum of particles. The average background level and fluctuations
affect both single inclusive spectra and dijet asymmetries, although
differently for different subtraction setups. A large azimuthal modulation of
the background has a visible effect on the azimuthal dijet distributions.
Quenching, as imple- mented in Q-PYTHIA, substantially affects the dijet
asymmetry but little the azimuthal dijet distributions. Besides, the missing
momentum characteristics observed in the experiment are qualitatively
reproduced by Q-PYTHIA.

expressions for calculating universal decoherence-induced errors in qubits
undergoing arbitrary, unitary, time-dependent quantum-control protocols. For a
qubit undergoing unitary decoherence the evolution of a qubit state in the
presence of time-varying semiclassical fields may be treated geometrically. We
show that the fidelity of an arbitrary control operation may then be expressed
to arbitrary order in terms of experimentally relevant spectral characteristics
of the noise and the control over all Cartesian directions and accounting for
noise cross-correlations. We formulate \emph{control matrices} in the time
domain to capture the effects of piecewise-constant control, and convert them
to generalized Fourier-domain filter functions. Such generalized filter
functions may therefore be derived for complex temporally modulated control
protocols, accounting for susceptibility to rotations of the qubit state vector
in three dimensions. Taken together, this framework provides a computationally
efficient means to calculate the effects of universal noise on arbitrary
quantum control protocols without the need for time-consuming simulations of
Bloch vector evolution. As a concrete example, we apply our method to treating
the problem of dynamical decoupling incorporating realistic control pulses of
arbitrary duration or form, including the replacement of simple $\pi$-pulses

that have focused on applications of these techniques in the graduation
context. Also, although it has been shown that the use of a variable or
adaptive smoothing parameter, based on the further information provided by the
exposed to the risk of death, provides additional benefits, specific

little attention has been given to providing methods in available software for
any kind of subsequent analysis with respect to the graduated mortality rates.
To facilitate analyses in the field, the R package DBKGrad is introduced. Among
the available kernel approaches, it considers a recent discrete beta kernel
estimator, in both its fixed and adaptive variants. In this approach, boundary
bias is automatically reduced and age is pragmatically considered as a discrete
variable. The bandwidth, fixed or adaptive, is allowed to be manually given by
the user or selected by cross-validation. Pointwise confidence intervals, for

for chirally symmetric theories. Constituent fermion masses are generated
through a yukawa interaction of the fermion with a scalar (or /and
psuedoscalar) field via the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the scalar (or
and psuedoscalar) field. We especially consider the high baryon density $\pi_0$
condensed phase, in which chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken, with space
varying expectation values of the $ \sigma$ and $\pi_0$ fields. This phase has
a spin polarized fermi sea as the ground state. We show that there is indeed
generated a macroscopic magnetization in this phase, contrary to what one would
have found, if one just used a primitive phenomenological magnetic moment
formula for explicit/ current fermion masses. Furthermore, this analysis
reveals that the magnetization of this state goes up as the VEV, that
determines the 'mass', comes down with increasing baryon density. The
consequent high magnetic field that is generated will destabilize this state at
a threshold density. This is important in the context of neutron stars, as such
a high density state may be responsible for very high magnetic fields in the
dense core of neutron stars. This could potentially be the origin of magnetars
- the stars with the largest magnetic fields in the universe.

for this transition towards cooperation. We find that, in addition to a high
degree of social herding, there has to be a nonlinear response to the fraction
of cooperators. We argue that the transition to cooperation in our model is
based on less information, i.e. on agents which are not informed about the
payoff matrix, and therefore rely on just observing the strategy of others, to
adopt it. By designing the right mechanisms to respond to this information, the
transition to cooperation can be remarkably enhanced.

  An essential step in the proof of this factorization result is the
calculation of the gluon spectrum at Next-to-Leading order, and in particular a
functional relationship that expresses the NLO correction as the action of a
certain operator on the LO spectrum.
  In this paper, we show that this type of relation between spectra at LO and
NLO is not specific to the production of gluons, but that it is in fact generic
for inclusive spectra in heavy ion collisions. To illustrate this, we compute
up to NLO the inclusive spectrum of some hypothetical scalar fields, either

in quantum systems and tunable experimental realizations exist in mesoscopic

the study of decoherence in quantum computing and quantum optics to extended

autocorrelation functions. As interesting applications of our method, we
explore the non-Markovian effects of the initial spin-bath preparation on the
dynamics of the coherence $\sigma^x(t)$ and of $\sigma^z(t)$ under a
Landau-Zener sweep of the bias field. We also compute to a high precision the

possible framework that accommodates this absence of methodology. Under the

extended `Chebyshev' parameterisation results in an improved stability in the
deuteron corrections that are required for the best fit to the `global' data.
The resulting PDFs have a significantly, but not dramatically, altered valence
down-quark distribution, $d_V$. For the extended set of MSTW PDFs, their
uncertainties can be obtained using 23, rather than the usual 20, orthogonal
`uncertainty' eigenvectors. Since the dominant effect is on the valence quarks,
we present a detailed study of the dependence of the valence--sea separation on
the predictions for the decay lepton charge asymmetry which results from
$W^\pm$ production at the LHC, illustrating the PDFs and the $x$ range probed
for different experimental scenarios. We show that the modified MSTW PDFs make
significantly improved predictions for these data at the LHC, particularly for
high values of the $p_T$ cut of the decay lepton. However, this is a special
case, since the asymmetry is extremely sensitive to valence--sea details, and
in particular to the combination $u_V-d_V$ of valence PDFs for $x \sim
M_W/\sqrt{s}$ at low lepton rapidities. We show that the predictions for a wide
variety of total cross sections are very similar to those obtained using the
MSTW2008 PDFs, with changes being much smaller than the PDF uncertainties.

Aims: We aim to obtain the stellar population parameters - age and metallicity
- of a sample of M31 and Galactic globular clusters. Studying their globular
cluster systems is an important step towards understanding their formation and
evolution in a complete way. Methods: Our analysis employs a modern
pixel-to-pixel spectral fitting technique to fit observed integrated spectra to
updated stellar population models. By comparing observations to models we
obtain the ages and metallicities of their stellar populations. We apply this
technique to a sample of 38 globular clusters in M31 and to 41 Galactic
globular clusters, used as a control sample. Results: Our sample of M31
globular clusters spans ages from 150 Myr to the age of the Universe.
Metallicities [Fe/H] range from -2.2 dex to the solar value. The
age-metallicity relation obtained can be described as having two components: an
old population with a flat age-[Fe/H] relation, possibly associated with the
halo and/or bulge, and a second one with a roughly linear relation between age
and metallicity, higher metallicities corresponding to younger ages, possibly
associated with the M31 disk. While we recover the very well known Galactic GC
metallicity bimodality, our own analysis of M31's metallicity distribution
function (MDF) suggests that both GC systems cover basically the same [Fe/H]
range yet M31's MDF is not clearly bimodal. These results suggest that both
galaxies experienced different star formation and accretion histories.

in the Large Magellanic Cloud with XMM-Newton. Carefully monitoring the
evolution of the X-ray light curve allows to probe the complex circumstellar
medium structure observed around the supernova progenitor star.
  Methods. We analyse all XMM-Newton observations of SNR 1987A from January
2007 to December 2011, using data from the EPIC-pn camera. Spectra from all
epochs are extracted and analysed in a homogeneous way. Using a multi-shock
model to fit the spectra across the 0.2-10 keV band we measure soft and hard
X-ray fluxes with high accuracy. In the hard X-ray band we examine the presence
and properties of Fe K ines. Our findings are interpreted in the framework of a
hydrodynamics-based model.
  Results. The soft X-ray flux of SNR 1987A continuously increased in the
recent years. Although the light curve shows a mild flattening, there is no
sudden break as reported in an earlier work, a picture echoed by a revision of
the Chandra light curve. We therefore conclude that material in the equatorial
ring and out-of-plane HII regions are still being swept-up. We estimate the
thickness of the equatorial ring to be at least 4.5x10^16 cm (0.0146 pc). This
lower limit will increase as long as the soft X-ray flux has not reached a
turn-over. We detect a broad Fe K line in all spectra from 2007 to 2011. The
widths and centroid energies of the lines indicate the presence of a collection
of iron ionisation stages. Thermal emission from the hydrodynamic model does
not reproduce the low-energy part of the line (6.4-6.5 keV), suggesting that
fluorescence from neutral and/or low ionisation Fe might be present.

superfluidity/superconductivity is characterized by a three-component order
parameter which denotes the pairing among the three colors of fermions. Due to
the SU$(3)$ symmetry of the Hamiltonian, one color does not participate
pairing. This branch of fermionic excitation is gapless in the naive BCS
mean-field description. In this paper, we adopt a pairing-fluctuation theory to
investigate the pairing fluctuation effects on the unpaired color in strongly
coupled atomic color superfluids and quark color superconductors. At low
temperature, a large pairing gap of the paired colors suppresses the pairing
fluctuation effects for the unpaired color, and the spectral density of the
unpaired color shows a single Fermi-liquid peak, which indicates the naive
mean-field picture remains valid. As the temperature is increased, the spectral
density of the unpaired color generally exhibits a three-peak structure: the
Fermi-liquid peak remains but get suppressed, and two pseudogap-like peaks
appears. At and above the superfluid transition temperature, the Fermi-liquid
peak disappears completely and the all three colors exhibits pseudogap-like

models of equation of state (EOS) of dense matter with high-density softening
due to hyperonization, based on the recent hyperon-nucleon and hyperon-hyperon
interactions, leading to a ""hyperon puzzle"".
  We study a specific solution of ""hyperon puzzle"", consisting in replacing a
too soft hyperon core by a sufficiently stiff quark core. We construct an
analytic approximation fitting very well modern EOSs of 2SC and CFL color
superconducting phases of quark matter. This allows us for simulating continua
of sequences of first-order phase transitions from hadronic matter to the 2SC,
and then to the CFL state of color superconducting quark matter.
  We obtain constraints in the parameter space of the EOS of superconducting
quark cores, resulting from M_max> 2 M_sol. We also derive constraints that
would result from significantly higher measured masses. For 2.4 M_sol required
stiffness of the CFL quark core should have been close to the causality limit,
the density jump at the phase transition being very small.
  Condition M_max > 2 M_sol puts strong constraints on the EOSs of the 2SC and
CFL phases of quark matter. Density jumps at the phase transitions have to be
sufficiently small and sound speeds in quark matter - sufficiently large. A
strict condition of thermodynamic stability of quark phase results in the
maximum mass of hybrid stars similar to that of purely baryon stars. Therefore,
to get M_max>2 M_sol for stable hybrid stars, both sufficiently strong
additional hyperon repulsion at high density baryon matter and a sufficiently
stiff EOS of quark matter would be needed. However, it is likely that the high
density instability of quark matter (reconfinement) indicates actually the
inadequacy of the point-particle model of baryons in dense matter at very high
densities.

independently from the black hole mass and accretion rate of the object. The

flavour violation in different New Physics (NP) scenarios that are presently
washed out by hadronic and experimental uncertainties. We illustrate this by
performing the anatomy of flavour violation in the 331 models, based on the
gauge group SU(3)_C X SU(3)_L X U(1)_X that are among the simplest NP scenarios
with new sources of flavour and CP violation. The latter originate dominantly
through the flavour violating interactions of ordinary quarks and leptons with
a new heavy Z' gauge boson. After discussing first these models in some
generality, we present a detailed study of Delta F=2 observables and of rare K
and B meson decays in the specific beta=1/\sqrt{3} model (to be called
overline{331} model) assuming significantly smaller uncertainties in CKM and
hadronic parameters than presently available. The most prominent roles in our
analysis play epsilon_K, Delta M_q (q=d,s), the mixing induced CP asymmetries
S_{psi K_S} and S_{psi phi}, rare decays B_{s,d}-> mu^+ mu^- and in particular
the CP-asymmetry S_{mu^+ mu^-}^s in B_s ->mu^+ mu^-. We identify a number of
correlations between various observables that differ from those known from CMFV
models. While, the Delta F=2 observables allow still for four oases in the new
parameter space, we demonstrate how the inclusion of Delta F=1 observables can
in the future identify the optimal oasis for this model. For 1 TeV <= M_{Z'}<=
3 TeV the overline{331} model is in good agreement with the recent data for
B^+->tau^+ nu_tau, it removes the epsilon_K-S_{psi K_S} tension present in the
SM and the epsilon_K-Delta M_{s,d} tension present in CMFV models.
Simultaneously, while differing from the SM, it is consistent with the present
data on BR(B_{s,d}->mu^+ mu^-) and S_{psi phi}. We identify the triple
correlation BR(B_s->mu^+ mu^-)-S_{psi phi}-S_{mu^+ mu^-}^s.

dimensional reduction and hyperviscous regularization, is presented. The
geometry of flat, elongated, or point-like rigid bodies immersed in a viscous
fluid is approximated by lower-dimensional objects, and a hyperviscous term is
added to the flow equation. The hyperviscosity is given by the product of the
ordinary viscosity with the square of a length that is shown to play the role
of effective thickness of any lower-dimensional object. Explicit solutions of
simple problems illustrate how the proposed method is able to represent with
good approximation both the velocity field and the drag forces generated by
rigid motions of the immersed bodies, in analogy with classical slender-body
theories. This approach has the potential to open up the way to more effective
computational techniques, since the complexity of the geometry can be
significantly reduced. This, however, is achieved at the expense of involving
higher-order derivatives of the velocity field. Importantly, both the
dimensional reduction and the hyperviscous regularization, combined with
suitable numerical schemes, can be used also in situations where inertia is not
negligible.

detection-directed (DD) sparse estimation using Bayesian hypothesis test (BHT)

sparse-binary sensing matrices which has the tree-like property and the
sampled-message approach for the implementation of BP.
  The key idea behind the proposed algorithm is that the recovery takes
DD-estimation structure consisting of two parts: support detection and signal
value estimation. BP and BHT perform the support detection, and an MMSE
estimator finds the signal values using the detected support set. The proposed
algorithm provides noise-robustness against measurement noise beyond the
conventional MAP approach, as well as a solution to remove quantization effect
by the sampled-message based BP independently of memory size for the message
sampling.
  We explain how the proposed algorithm can have the aforementioned
characteristics via exemplary discussion. In addition, our experiments validate
such superiority of the proposed algorithm, compared to recent algorithms under
noisy setup. Interestingly the experimental results show that performance of
the proposed algorithm approaches that of the oracle estimator as SNR becomes

transitions, polarization of light, double refraction and colours. A pilot
evaluation of the module was performed among pre-service primary school
teachers who have no special preference for natural sciences. The evaluation
shows that the module is very efficient in transferring knowledge. A prior
study showed that the informally obtained pre-knowledge on liquid crystals of
the first year students on several different study fields is negligible. Since
the social science students are the ones that are the least interested in
natural sciences it can be expected that students in any study programme will
on average achieve at least as good conceptual understanding of phenomena
related to liquid crystals as the group involved in the pilot study.

binary sources is a key requirement for gravitational-wave astronomy.
Evaluating the posterior probability density function of the binary's
parameters (component masses, sky location, distance, etc.) requires computing
millions of waveforms. The computational expense of parameter estimation is
dominated by waveform generation and scales linearly with the waveform
computational cost. Previous work showed that gravitational waveforms from
non-spinning compact binary sources are amenable to a truncated singular value
decomposition, which allows them to be reconstructed via interpolation at fixed
computational cost. However, the accuracy requirement for parameter estimation
is typically higher than for searches, so it is crucial to ascertain that
interpolation does not lead to significant errors. Here we provide a proof of
principle to show that interpolated waveforms can be used to recover posterior
probability density functions with negligible loss in accuracy with respect to
non-interpolated waveforms. This technique has the potential to significantly
increase the efficiency of parameter estimation.

sign (antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic). The resulting spin lattice is
quasi-one-dimensional and not frustrated. Quantum MC simulations show excellent

the small-scale structure. In addition to the previously known CG 1 IRS 1 we
discovered three new NIR-excess objects, two in CG 1 and one in CG 2. CG 2 IRS
1 is the first detection of star formation in CG 2. Spectral energy
distribution (SED) fitting suggests the NIR-excess objects are young low-mass

1 drives a bipolar outflow, which is very weak in CO, but the cavity walls are
seen in reflected light in our NIR and in the Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 mum images.
Strong emission from excited polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon particles and very
small grains were detected in the CG 1 tail. The total mass of CG 1 in the

matching tasks, especially when going mobile. While they are extensively
studied in this context, their ability to carry enough information in order to
infer the original image is seldom addressed.
  In this work, we leverage an inverse problem approach to show that it is
possible to directly reconstruct the image content from Local Binary
Descriptors. This process relies on very broad assumptions besides the
knowledge of the pattern of the descriptor at hand. This generalizes previous
results that required either a prior learning database or non-binarized
features.
  Furthermore, our reconstruction scheme reveals differences in the way
different Local Binary Descriptors capture and encode image information. Hence,
the potential applications of our work are multiple, ranging from privacy
issues caused by eavesdropping image keypoints streamed by mobile devices to
the design of better descriptors through the visualization and the analysis of
their geometric content.

seismic constraints on the internal transport and surface loss of angular
momentum of oscillating solar-like stars. To this end, we study the evolution
of rotational splittings from the pre-main sequence to the red-giant branch for
stochastically excited oscillation modes. We modified the evolutionary code
CESAM2K to take rotationally induced transport in radiative zones into account.
Linear rotational splittings were computed for a sequence of $1.3 M_{\odot}$
models. Rotation profiles were derived from our evolutionary models and
eigenfunctions from linear adiabatic oscillation calculations. We find that
transport by meridional circulation and shear turbulence yields far too high a
core rotation rate for red-giant models compared with recent seismic
observations. We discuss several uncertainties in the physical description of
stars that could have an impact on the rotation profiles. For instance, we find
that the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability does not extract enough angular
momentum from the core to account for the discrepancy. In contrast, an increase
of the horizontal turbulent viscosity by 2 orders of magnitude is able to
significantly decrease the central rotation rate on the red-giant branch. Our
results indicate that it is possible that the prescription for the horizontal
turbulent viscosity largely underestimates its actual value or else a mechanism
not included in current stellar models of low mass stars is needed to slow down
the rotation in the radiative core of red-giant stars.

of generalized Verma module the auxiliary representations of the constraint

solved through this approach, while a definitive endorsement for Extended
Theories of Gravity could arrive from the realization of a consistent

driven by a mysterious form of `dark energy' constituting most of the Universe,
has further revived the interest in testing Einstein's theory of General
Relativity. At the very foundation of Einstein's theory is the geodesic motion
of a small, structureless test-particle. Depending on the physical context, a
star, planet or satellite can behave very nearly like a test-particle, so
geodesic motion is used to calculate the advance of the perihelion of a
planet's orbit, the dynamics of a binary pulsar system and of an Earth orbiting
satellite. Verifying geodesic motion is then a test of paramount importance to
General Relativity and other theories of fundamental physics. On the basis of
the first few months of observations of the recently launched satellite LARES,
its orbit shows the best agreement of any satellite with the test-particle
motion predicted by General Relativity. That is, after modelling its known
non-gravitational perturbations, the LARES orbit shows the smallest deviations
from geodesic motion of any artificial satellite. LARES-type satellites can
thus be used for accurate measurements and for tests of gravitational and
fundamental physics. Already with only a few months of observation, LARES
provides smaller scatter in the determination of several low-degree
geopotential coefficients (Earth gravitational deviations from sphericity) than
available from observations of any other satellite or combination of

the cosmological viability of $f(T)$ dark energy models as geometrical
constraints on the derivatives of these models. We show that in the phase space
exists two cosmologically viable trajectory which (i) The universe would start
from an unstable radiation point, then pass a saddle standard matter point
which is followed by accelerated expansion de sitter point. (ii) The universe
starts from a saddle radiation epoch, then falls onto the stable matter era and
the system can not evolve to the dark energy dominated epoch. Finally, for a
number of $f(T)$ dark energy models were proposed in the more literature, the
viability conditions are investigated.

X-ray scattering (RIXS) of Chromium with commensurate spin-density wave (SDW)
order, based on a multi-band Hubbard model composed of 3$d$ and 4$s$ orbitals.
Obtaining the ground state with the SDW mean-field approximation, we calculate
the dynamical transverse and longitudinal spin susceptibility by using
random-phase approximation. We find that a collective spin-wave excitation seen
in inelastic neutron scattering hardly damps up to $\sim$0.6 eV. Above the
energy, the excitation overlaps individual particle-hole excitations as
expected, leading to broad spectral weight. On the other hand, the collective
spin-wave excitation in RIXS spectra has a tendency to be masked by large
spectral weight coming from particle-hole excitations with various orbital
channels. This is in contrast with inelastic neutron scattering, where only
selected diagonal orbital channels contribute to the spectral weight. However,
it may be possible to detect the spin-wave excitation in RIXS experiments in
the future if resolution is high enough.

complexity abounds in nature. This paper comprises three sections. In the first
section we consider the question why there are so many universal phenomena
around. So, in a sense, we week a driving force behind the PCE if any. We
postulate a principle GNS that we call the Generalized Natural Selection
Principle that together with the Church-Turing Thesis is seen to be equivalent
to a weak version of PCE. In the second section we ask the question why we do
not observe any phenomena that are complex but not-universal. We choose a
cognitive setting to embark on this question and make some analogies with
formal logic. In the third and final section we report on a case study where we
see rich structures arise everywhere.

degenerate critical points on Hilbert spaces, which is one of key results in
infinite dimensional Morse theory, is usually stated for at least $C^2$-smooth
functionals. It obstructs one using Morse theory to study most of variational
problems of form $F(u)=\int_\Omega f(x, u,..., D^mu)dx$ as in (\ref{e:1.1}). In
this paper we establish a splitting theorem and a shifting theorem for a class
of continuously directional differentiable functionals (lower than $C^1$) on a
Hilbert space $H$ which have higher smoothness (but lower than $C^2$) on a
densely and continuously imbedded Banach space $X\subset H$ near a critical
point lying in $X$. (This splitting theorem generalize almost all previous ones
to my knowledge). Moreover, a new theorem of Poincar\'e-Hopf type and a
relation between critical groups of the functional on $H$ and $X$ are given.
Different from the usual implicit function theorem method and dynamical system
one our proof is to combine the ideas of the Morse-Palais lemma due to
Duc-Hung-Khai \cite{DHK} with some techniques from \cite{JM, Skr, Va1}. Our
theory is applicable to the Lagrangian systems on compact manifolds and
boundary value problems for a large class of nonlinear higher order elliptic
equations.
