that are invariant under $Z_2$ and U(1) chiral symmetries, are known to suffer
from sign problems when formulated using the auxiliary field approach. Although
these problems have been ignored in previous studies, they can be severe. In
this talk, we show that the sign problems disappear when the models are
formulated in the fermion bag approach, allowing us to solve them rigorously
for the first time.

usage in application of attack detection in Networkbased Intrusion Detection

OR1K, MIPS32, ARM7TDMI and PowerPC32 microprocessors, their performance has
been evaluated and analyzed. For performance improvement, the compiler
optimization levels are employed and at the end; base on O2 optimization level
a new combination of optimization flags is presented. The experiments show that

influences the physical conditions (such as surface temperature and rotation
rate) of the WDs prior to mass transfer or merger. In these systems, the
dominant tidal effects involve the excitation of gravity waves and their
dissipation in the outer envelope of the star. We calculate the amplitude of
tidally excited gravity waves in low-mass (0.3M_\odot) helium-core (He) WDs as
a function of the tidal forcing frequency \omega. Like carbon-oxygen (CO) WDs
studied in our previous paper, we find that the dimensionless tidal torque
F(\omega) (inversely proportional to the effective tidal quality factor) has an
erratic dependence on \omega. On average, F(\omega) scales approximately as
\omega^6, and is several orders of magnitude smaller for He WDs than for CO
WDs. We find that tidal torques can begin to synchronize the WD rotation when
the orbital period is less than about a hour, although a nearly constant
asynchronization is maintained even at small periods. We examine where the
tidally excited gravity waves experience non-linear breaking or resonant
absorption at a critical layer, allowing us to estimate the location and
magnitude of tidal heating in the WD envelope. We then incorporate tidal
heating in the MESA stellar evolution code, calculating the physical conditions
of the WD as a function of orbital period for different WD models. We find that
tidal heating makes a significant contribution to the WD luminosity for
short-period (~10 min) systems such as SDSS J0651+2844. We also find that for
WDs containing a hydrogen envelope, tidal heating can trigger runaway hydrogen
shell burning, leading to a nova-like event before the onset of mass transfer.

simulation modeling of the formation of circumstellar disks from the direct
collapse of prestellar cloud cores. This has implications for many aspects of
star and planet formation, including the growth of dust and high-temperature
processing of materials. A defining result is that the early evolution of a
disk is crucially affected by the continuing mass loading from the core
envelope, and is driven into recurrent phases of gravitational instability.
Nonlinear spiral arms formed during these episodes fragment to form gaseous
clumps in the disk. These clumps generally migrate inward due to gravitational
torques arising from their interaction with a trailing spiral arm.
Occasionally, a clump can open up a gap in the disk and settle into a stable
orbit, revealing a direct pathway to the formation of companion stars, brown
dwarfs, or giant planets. At other times, when multiple clumps are present, a
low mass clump may even be ejected from the system, providing a pathway to the
formation of free-floating brown dwarfs and giant planets in addition to low
mass stars. Finally, it has been suggested that the inward migration of gaseous
clumps can provide the proper conditions for the transport of high-temperature
processed solids from the outer disk to the inner disk, and even possibly
accelerate the formation of terrestrial planets in the inner disk. All of these
features arising from clump formation and migration can be tied together
conceptually in a Migrating Embryo model for disk evolution that can complement
the well-known Core Accretion model for planet formation.

problems both in mathematical tractability and clinical observability. We
investigate statistical properties of transient cortical wave patterns with
characteristic forms (shape, size, duration) in a canonical reaction-diffusion
model with mean field inhibition. The patterns are formed by a ghost near a
saddle-node bifurcation in which a stable traveling wave (node) collides with
its critical nucleation mass (saddle). Similar patterns have been observed with
fMRI in migraine. Our results support the controversial idea that waves of
cortical spreading depression (SD) have a causal relationship with the headache
phase in migraine and therefore occur not only in migraine with aura (MA) but
also in migraine without aura (MO), i.e., in the two major migraine subforms.
We suggest a congruence between the prevalence of MO and MA with the
statistical properties of the traveling waves' forms, according to which (i)
activation of nociceptive mechanisms relevant for headache is dependent upon a
sufficiently large instantaneous affected cortical area anti-correlated to both
SD duration and total affected cortical area such that headache would be less
severe in MA than in MO (ii) the incidence of MA is reflected in the distance
to the saddle-node bifurcation, and (iii) the contested notion of MO attacks
with silent aura is resolved. We briefly discuss model-based control and means
by which neuromodulation techniques may affect pathways of pain formation.

merits of R.A. Fisher's objections to the decision-theoretic framing of
frequentist inference. It is argued that this framing is congruent with the
Bayesian but incongruent with the frequentist inference. It provides the
Bayesian approach with a theory of optimal inference, but it misrepresents the
theory of optimal frequentist inference by framing inferences solely in terms
of the universal quantifier `for all values of theta in the parameter space'.
This framing is at odds with the primary objective of model-based frequentist
inference, which is to learn from data about the true value of theta (unknown
parameter(s)); the one that gave rise to the particular data. The frequentist
approach relies on factual (estimation, prediction), as well as hypothetical
(testing) reasoning whose primary aim is to learn from data about the true
theta. The paper calls into question the appropriateness of admissibility and
reassesses Stein's paradox as it relates to the capacity of frequentist
estimators to pinpoint the true theta. The paper also compares and contrasts
loss-based errors with traditional frequentist errors, such as coverage, type I
and II; the former are attached to {\theta}, but the latter to the inference
procedure itself.

biological processes. The ability to both observe and analyse the details of
molecular diffusion in vivo at the single molecule and single cell level can
add significant insight into understanding molecular architectures of diffusing
molecules and the nanoscale environment in which the molecules diffuse. The
tool of choice for monitoring dynamic molecular localization in live cells is
fluorescence microscopy, especially so combining total internal reflection
fluorescence (TIRF) with the use of fluorescent protein (FP) reporters in
offering exceptional imaging contrast for dynamic processes in the cell
membrane under relatively physiological conditions compared to competing single
molecule techniques. There exist several different complex modes of diffusion,
and discriminating these from each other is challenging at the molecular level
due to underlying stochastic behaviour. Analysis is traditionally performed
using mean square displacements of tracked particles, however, this generally
requires more data points than is typical for single FP tracks due to
photophysical instability. Presented here is a novel approach allowing robust
Bayesian ranking of diffusion processes (BARD) to discriminate multiple complex
modes probabilistically. It is a computational approach which biologists can
use to understand single molecule features in live cells.

received a lot of attention. Given a shared n-bit weak random source X with
min-entropy k and a security parameter s, the main goal is to construct an
explicit 2-round privacy amplification protocol that achieves entropy loss
O(s). Dodis and Wichs \cite{DW09} showed that optimal protocols can be achieved
by constructing explicit non-malleable extractors. However, the best known
explicit non-malleable extractor only achieves k=0.49n \cite{Li12b} and
evidence in \cite{Li12b} suggests that constructing explicit non-malleable
extractors for smaller min-entropy may be hard. In an alternative approach, Li
\cite{Li12} introduced the notion of a non-malleable condenser and showed that
explicit non-malleable condensers also give optimal privacy amplification
protocols.
  In this paper, we give the first construction of non-malleable condensers for
arbitrary min-entropy. Using our construction, we obtain a 2-round privacy
amplification protocol with optimal entropy loss for security parameter up to
s=\Omega(\sqrt{k}). This is the first protocol that simultaneously achieves
optimal round complexity and optimal entropy loss for arbitrary min-entropy k.
We also generalize this result to obtain a protocol that runs in O(s/\sqrt{k})
rounds with optimal entropy loss, for security parameter up to s=\Omega(k).
This significantly improves the protocol in \cite{ckor}. Finally, we give a
better non-malleable condenser for linear min-entropy, and in this case obtain
a 2-round protocol with optimal entropy loss for security parameter up to
s=\Omega(k), which improves the entropy loss and communication complexity of
the protocol in \cite{Li12b}.

emitted power from a finite size macroscopic blackbody to far field vacuum can
be significantly enhanced, within the constraint of the second law of

deterministic binary linear threshold model. Our starting point is a networked
coordination game where each agent's payoff is the sum of the payoffs coming
from pairwise interactions with each of the neighbors. We first establish that
the best response dynamics in this networked game is equivalent to the linear
threshold dynamics with heterogeneous thresholds over the agents. While the
previous literature has studied such linear threshold models under the
assumption that each agent may change actions at most once, a study of best
response dynamics in such networked games necessitates an analysis that allows
for multiple switches in actions. In this paper, we develop such an analysis
and construct a combinatorial framework to understand the behavior of the
model. To this end, we establish that the agents behavior cycles among
different actions in the limit and provide three sets of results.
  We first characterize the limiting behavioral properties of the dynamics. We
determine the length of the limit cycles and reveal bounds on the time steps
required to reach such cycles for different network structures. We then study
the complexity of decision/counting problems that arise within the context.
Specifically, we consider the tractability of counting the number of limit
cycles and fixed-points, and deciding the reachability of action profiles. We
finally propose a measure of network resilience that captures the nature of the
involved dynamics. We prove bounds and investigate the resilience of different
network structures under this measure.

new mechanism is much stronger, and is independent of the Reynolds number. The
present study provides details of the theory and numerical modeling of the
flame acceleration. It is shown theoretically and computationally that flame
acceleration progresses noticeably faster in the axisymmetric cylindrical
geometry as compared to the planar one, and that the acceleration rate reduces
with increasing initial Mach number and thereby the gas compressibility.
Furthermore, the velocity of the accelerating flame saturates to a constant
value that is supersonic with respect to the wall. The saturation state can be
correlated to the Chapman-Jouguet deflagration as well as the fast flames
observed in experiments. The possibility of transition from deflagration to
detonation in the obstructed channels is demonstrated.

frequency of appearance of other states and, hence, their effective values. We
quantify the effective value of states by an {\sl electoral susceptibility},

functionally competent folded states may not be unique, as is generally
assumed. Indeed, molecule-to-molecule variations in the dynamics of enzymes and
ribozymes under folding conditions have recently been identified in single
molecule experiments. However, systematic quantification and the structural
origin of the observed complex behavior remain elusive. Even for a relatively
simple case of isomerization dynamics in Holliday Junctions (HJs), molecular
heterogeneities persist over a long observation time (Tobs ~ 40 sec). Here,
using concepts in glass physics and complementary clustering analysis, we
provide a quantitative method to analyze the smFRET data probing the
isomerization in HJ dynamics. We show that ergodicity of HJ dynamics is
effectively broken; as a result, the conformational space of HJs is partitioned
into a folding network of kinetically disconnected clusters. While
isomerization dynamics in each cluster occurs rapidly as if the associated
conformational space is fully sampled, distinct patterns of time series
belonging to different clusters do not interconvert on Tobs. Theory suggests
that persistent heterogeneity of HJ dynamics is a consequence of internal
multiloops with varying sizes and flexibilities frozen by Mg2+ ions. An
annealing experiment using Mg2+ pulse that changes the Mg2+ cocentration from
high to low to high values lends support to this idea by explicitly showing
that interconversions can be driven among trajectories with different patterns.

derived from the Cho-Duan-Ge decomposition. These monopoles, unlike Dirac and
't Hooft monopoles, do not require a singular gauge field and are defined for
any choice of gauge (and are not just restricted to, for example, the maximum
Abelian gauge). The Abelian decomposition is defined in terms of a colour field
$n$; the principle novelty of our study is that we have used a unique
definition of this field in terms of the eigenvectors of the Wilson Loop. This
allows us to investigate the relationship between the gauge invariant monopoles
and confinement both analytically and numerically, as well as retaining the
maximal possible symmetry within the colour field so that it is able to see all
the monopoles in an SU($N_C$) calculation.
  We describe how the Abelian decomposition is related to the Wilson Loop, so
that the string tension may be calculated from the field strength related to
the decomposed (or restricted) Abelian field. We discuss the structures in the
colour field which may cause an area law in the Wilson Loop, which turn out to
be magnetic monopoles. If these monopoles are present, they will lead to an
area law scaling of the Wilson Loop and thus be at least partially responsible
for confinement.
  We search for these monopoles in quenched lattice QCD. We show that the
string tension is dominated by peaks in the restricted field strength, at least
some of which are located close to structures in the colour field consistent
with with theoretical expectations for the monopoles. We show that the string
tension extracted from the monopole contribution to the restricted field is
close to that of the entire original field; again suggesting that confinement
can at least partially be explained in terms of these monopoles.

DES cluster sample will, in conjunction with existing mm-wave data from the
South Pole Telescope (SPT), yield a detection of the pairwise kSZ signal at the
8-13 sigma level, with sensitivity peaking for clusters separated by ~100 Mpc
distances. A next-generation version of SPT would allow for a 18-30 sigma
detection and would be limited by variance from the kSZ signal itself and
residual thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal. Throughout our analysis we
assume photometric redshift errors, which wash out the signal for clusters
separated by <~50 Mpc; a spectroscopic survey of the DES sample would recover
this signal and allow for a 26-43 sigma detection, and would again be limited
by kSZ/tSZ variance. Assuming a standard model of structure formation, these
high-precision measurements of the pairwise kSZ signal will yield detailed
information on the gas content of the galaxy clusters. Alternatively, if the
gas can be sufficiently characterized by other means (e.g. using tSZ, X-ray, or
weak lensing), then the relative velocities of the galaxy clusters can be
isolated, thereby providing a precision measurement of gravity on 100 Mpc

Brownian-type behavior with a diffusion coefficient considerably greater than
that of the solvent. As previously postulated by both experimental and
theoretical works, the instantaneous response of the electron to the
librational motions of surrounding water molecules constitutes the principal
mode of motion. The diffusive mechanism can be understood within the
traditional framework of transfer diffusion processes, where the diffusive step
is akin to the exchange of an extramolecular electron between neighboring water
molecules. This is a second-order process with a computed rate constant of 5.0
ps^{-1} at 298 K. In agreement with experiment the electron diffusion exhibits
Arrhenius behavior over the temperature range of 298-400 K. We compute an
activation energy of 8.9 kJ/mol. Through analysis of Arrhenius plots and the
application of a simple random walk model it is demonstrated that the computed
rate constant for exchange of an excess electron is indeed the phenomenological
rate constant associated with the diffusive process.

reminiscent of the large-scale filaments. We propose an observationally derived
scenario for filamentary star formation that describes the evolution of

(0.1 pc in length) with higher densities embedded in starless cores should
exist, although to date almost all the interferometers have failed to observe

prestellar stage by modeling the known Class 0 flattened envelope in L1157
using both the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy (CARMA)

reasonable estimates for the column density through the flattened envelope, the
CARMA D-array at 3mm wavelengths is not able to detect such filamentary
structure, so previous studies would not have detected them. However, the
substructures may be detected with CARMA D+E array at 3 mm and CARMA E array at
1 mm as a result of more appropriate resolution and sensitivity. ALMA is also
capable of detecting the substructures and showing the structures in detail

small bias, which signifies that superdiffusive behaviour emerges beyond the

to survey an exogenous component of the climatic variability is through the
measurement of variations in the diameter and shape of the solar disk. At
Observatorio Nacional/MCTI, Rio de Janeiro, after several years of diameter
observation using a CCD Solar Astrolabe, these measurements are now performed
by a state-of-the-art Solar Heliometer. The heliometric method is one of the
most successful techniques to measure small variations of angles. Its principle
has been used for the latest space borne astrometric missions, aiming to
milli-arcsecond precision. The success of this method relies in the fact that
it minimizes the dependence of angular measurements to the thermal and
mechanical stability of the instrument. However in the classic heliometer the
objective is split into two halves to which is applied a linear displacement
along the cut, thus still leaving room for a residual dependence with the
focus, due to non-concentricity of the beams of the two images. The focus
variation, as well as the effects brought by the large temperature variations
during solar observations, was tackled in the Solar Heliometer by having all
optical elements and their niches made on CCZ, and the telescope tube on carbon
fiber, both materials of negligible thermal coefficient. Additionally, the
measures are made perpendicular to the separation direction and the plate scale
can be known at every time from the solar motion itself. We present the results

issue, discussed since 1966. No other stellar arc is so perfect a segment of a
circle, moreover, there is another similar arc nearby. Many hypotheses were
advanced to explain these arcs, and all but one of these were disproved. It was
proposed in 2004 that origin of these arcs was due to the bow shock from the
jet, which is intermittently fired by the Milky Way nucleus and during the last
episode of its activity the jet was pointed to the LMC. Quite recently evidence
for such a jet has really appeared. We suppose it was once energetic enough to
trigger star formation in the LMC, and if the jet opening angle was about
2{\deg}, it could push out HI gas from the region of about 2 kpc in size,
forming a cavity LMC4, but also squeezed two dense clouds, which occurred in
the same area, causing the formation of stars along their surfaces facing the
core of the MW. In result, spherical segments of the stellar shells might
arise, visible now as the arcs of Quadrant and Sextant, the apices of which
point to the center of the MW. This orientation of both arcs can be the key to
unlocking their origin. Here we give data which confirm the above hypothesis,
amongst which are radial velocities of stars inside and outside the larger one
of the LMC arcs. The probability is low that a jet from an AGN points to a
nearby galaxy and triggers star formation there, but a few other examples are
now known or suspected.

viscosity at low temperatures is considered to be one of the hallmarks of
glassy dynamics in liquids. Theoretical analyses relate this breakdown with the
presence of heterogeneous dynamics, and by extension, with the fragility of
glass formers. We perform an investigation of the breakdown of the SE relation
in 2, 3 and 4 dimensions, in order to understand these interrelations. Results
from simulations of model glass formers show that the degree of the breakdown
of the SE relation decreases with increasing spatial dimensionality. The
breakdown itself can be rationalized via the difference between the activation
free energies for diffusivity and viscosity (or relaxation times) in the
Adam-Gibbs relation in three and four dimensions. The behavior in two
dimensions also can be understood in terms of a generalized Adam-Gibbs relation
that is observed in previous work. We calculate various measures of
heterogeneity of dynamics and find that the degree of the SE breakdown and
measures of heterogeneity of dynamics are generally well correlated but with
some exceptions. The two dimensional systems we study show deviations from the
pattern of behavior of the three and four dimensional systems both at high and
low temperatures. The fragility of the studied liquids is found to increase
with spatial dimensionality, contrary to the expectation based on the
association of fragility with heterogeneous dynamics.

efficiency with which they are mixed with the primordial gas in the supernova
envelope. In supernovae with high energies ($E\simgt 5\times 10^{52}$ erg), an
appreciable fraction of the gas can be ejected from the protogalaxy, but nearly
all the heavy elements remain in the protogalaxy. In explosions with lower
energies ($E\simlt 3\times 10^{52}$ erg), essentially no gas and heavy elements
are lost from the protogalaxy: during the first one to threemillion years, the
gas and heavy elements are actively carried from the central region of the
protogalaxy ($r\sim 0.1 r_{vir}$, where $r_{vir}$ is the virial radius of the
protogalaxy), but an appreciable fraction of the mass of metals subsequently
returns when the hot cavity cools and the envelope collapses. Supernovae with
high energies ($E\simgt 5\times 10^{52}$ erg) are characterized by a very low
efficiency of mixing of metals; their heavy elements are located in the small
volume occupied by the disrupted envelope (in a volume comparable with that of
the entire envelope), with most of the metals remaining inside the hot,
rarified cavity of the envelope. (abridged)

particles. In conventional broad-beam delivery, fine range adjustment is
achieved by insertion of range shifting and compensating materials. In
dosimetry, solid phantoms are often used for convenience. These materials
should ideally be equivalent to water. In this study, we evaluated dosimetric
water equivalence of four common plastics, HDPE, PMMA, PET, and POM.
  Methods: Using the Bethe formula for energy loss, the Gottschalk formula for
multiple scattering, and the Sihver formula for nuclear interactions, we
calculated the effective densities of the plastics for these interactions. We
experimentally measured variation of the Bragg peak of carbon-ion beams by
insertion of HDPE, PMMA, and POM, which were compared with analytical model
calculations.
  Results: The theoretical calculation resulted in slightly reduced multiple
scattering and severely increased nuclear interactions for HDPE, compared to
water and the other plastics. The increase in attenuation of carbon ions for
20-cm range shift was experimentally measured to be 8.9\% for HDPE, 2.5\% for
PMMA, and 0.0\% for POM while PET was theoretically estimated to be in between
PMMA and POM. The agreement between the measurements and the calculations was
about 1\% or better.
  Conclusions: For carbon-ion beams, POM was dosimetrically indistinguishable
from water and the best of the plastics examined in this study. The poorest was
HDPE, which would reduce the Bragg peak by 0.45\% per 1-cm range shift,
although with marginal superiority for reduced multiple scattering. Between the
two clear plastics, PET would be superior to PMMA in dosimetric water
equivalence.

the Schr\""odinger picture without assumption of any further approximation. An
extensive code is developed which is able to accurately solve the system and
track its evolution with high precision in time, while maintaining sufficient
degrees of arbitrariness in setting up the initial conditions and interacting
partitions. Using this code, we have been able to numerically evaluate various
parameters such as probabilities, expectation values (of field and atomic
operators), as well as the concurrence as the most rigorously defined measure
of entanglement of quantum systems. We present and discuss several examples
including a seven-partition system consisting of six quantum dots interacting
with one cavity mode. We observe for the first time that the behavior of
quantum systems under ultrastrong coupling is significantly different than the
weakly and strongly coupled systems, marked by onset of a chaos and abrupt
phase changes. We also discuss how to implement spin into the theoretical
picture and thus successfully simulate a recently reported spin-entanglement
experiment.
