properties of principal component analysis (PCA). Our frame- work includes
several previously studied domains of asymptotics as special cases and allows
one to investigate interesting connections and transitions among the various
domains. More importantly, it enables us to investigate asymptotic scenarios
that have not been considered before, and gain new insights into the
consistency, subspace consistency and strong inconsistency regions of PCA and
the boundaries among them. We also establish the corresponding convergence rate
within each region. Under general spike covariance models, the dimension (or
the number of variables) discourages the consistency of PCA, while the sample
size and spike information (the relative size of the population eigenvalues)
encourages PCA consistency. Our framework nicely illustrates the relationship
among these three types of information in terms of dimension, sample size and
spike size, and rigorously characterizes how their relationships affect PCA
consistency.

mu+ mu- candidates with respect to the background expectation. The probability
that the background could produce such an excess or larger is 5.3 x 10^-4

maximum-likelihood fit gives a branching fraction of BR(Bs -> mu+ mu-) =

prove a lower bound for the gonality of a curve over the algebraic closure of k

minimize over all so-called finite harmonic graph morphisms to trees, that
originate from any refinement of the dual graph of the stable model of the
curve. Next comes our main result: we prove a lower bound for the degree of
such a graph morphism in terms of the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian and
some ""volume"" of the original graph; this can be seen as a substitute for
graphs of the Li-Yau inequality from differential geometry, although we also
prove that the strict analogue of the original inequality fails for general
graphs. Finally, we apply the results to give a lower bound for the gonality of
arbitrary Drinfeld modular curves over finite fields and for general congruence
subgroups Gamma of Gamma(1) that is linear in the index [Gamma(1):Gamma], with
a constant that only depends on the residue field degree and the degree of the

connection between relativistic and non-relativistic physics. We explore this

the Lorentzian distance in the full spacetime with the least action of a
mechanical system living in a quotient classical space time. The timelike
eikonal equation satisfied by the Lorentzian distance is proved to be
equivalent to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the least action. We also prove
that the Legendre transform on the classical base corresponds to the musical
isomorphism on the light cone, and the Young-Fenchel inequality is nothing but
a well known geometric inequality in Lorentzian geometry. A strategy to
simplify the dynamics passing to a reference frame moving with the E.-L. flow
is explained. It is then proved that the causality properties can be
conveniently expressed in terms of the least action. In particular, strong
causality coincides with stable causality and is equivalent to the lower
semi-continuity of the classical least action on the diagonal, while global
hyperbolicity is equivalent to the coercivity condition on the action
functional. The classical Tonelli's theorem in the calculus of variations
corresponds, then, to the well known result that global hyperbolicity implies
causal simplicity. The well known problem of recasting the metric in a global
Rosen form is shown to be equivalent to that of finding global solutions to the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation having complete characteristics.

such as remnant inventory systems, shipping logistics, and appointment

raw material, packages for delivery) is revealed one at a time, and each item
must be packed on arrival in an available bin (e.g., remnant pieces of raw
material in inventory, shipping containers). The sizes of items are i.i.d.
samples from an unknown distribution, but the sizes are known when the items
arrive. The goal is to minimize the number of non-empty bins (equivalently
waste, defined to be the total unused space in non-empty bins). This problem
has been extensively studied in the Operations Research and Theoretical
Computer Science communities, yet all existing heuristics either rely on
learning the distribution or exhibit $o(T)$ additive suboptimality compared to
the optimal offline algorithm only for certain classes of distributions (those
with sublinear optimal expected waste). In this paper, we propose a family of
algorithms which are the first truly distribution-oblivious algorithms for
stochastic bin packing, and achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ additive
suboptimality for all item size distributions. Our algorithms are inspired by
approximate interior-point algorithms for convex optimization. In addition to
regret guarantees for discrete i.i.d. sequences, we extend our results to
continuous item size distribution with bounded density, and also prove a family
of novel regret bounds for non-i.i.d. input sequences. To the best of our
knowledge these are the first such results for non-i.i.d. and
non-random-permutation input sequences for online stochastic packing.

logL_X + xi_K logL_K + xi_0, having a ~1 dex wide (1 sigma) spread in radio

distribution was found and therefore any definition of radio loudness in AGN is
arbitrary. Using scaling relations between the BH mass and the host galaxy
K-band luminosity, we have also derived a new estimate of the BH fundamental

measures of the BH fundamental plane are biased by ~0.8 dex in favor of the
most luminous radio sources. Therefore, many AGN studies, where the BH

stars with very thin hydrogen envelopes situated on or near the extreme
horizontal branch (EHB). The formation of sdBs is still unclear as well as the
chemical composition of their atmospheres. The observed helium depletion is
attributed to atmospheric diffusion. Metal abundances have been determined for
about a dozen sdBs only resulting in puzzling patterns with enrichment of heavy
metals and depletion of lighter ones. Aims: In this paper we present a detailed
metal abundance analysis of 106 sdBs. Methods: From high resolution spectra we
measured elemental abundances of up to 24 different ions per star. A
semi-automatic analysis pipeline was developed to calculate and fit LTE models
to a standard set of spectral lines. Results: A general trend of enrichment was
found with increasing temperature for most of the heavier elements. The lighter
elements like carbon, oxygen and nitrogen are depleted and less affected by
temperature. Although there is considerable scatter from star to star, the
general abundance patterns in most sdBs are similar. State-of-the-art diffusion
models predict such patterns and are in qualitative agreement with our results.
However, the highest enrichments measured cannot not be explained with these
models. Peculiar line shapes of the strongest metal lines in some stars
indicate vertical stratification to be present in the atmospheres. Such effects
are not accounted for in current diffusion models and may be responsible for
some of the yet unexplained abundance anomalies.

the sensitivity and resolution of future extremely large telescopes. The
collision-induced absorption (CIA) of molecular hydrogen causes a clearly
defined blue turn-off along the WD (WDBTO) cooling sequences and a bright
secondary maximum in the WD LFs. These features are independent of age over a
broad age range and are minimally affected by metal abundance. This means that
the NIR magnitudes of the WDBTO are very promising distance indicators. The
interplay between the cooling time of progressively more massive WDs and the
onset of CIA causes a red turn-off along the WD (WDRTO) cooling sequences and a
well defined faint peak in the WD LFs. These features are very sensitive to the
cluster age, and indeed the K-band magnitude of the faint peak increases by
0.2--0.25 mag/Gyr for ages between 10 and 14 Gyr. On the other hand, the faint
peak in the optical WD LF increases in the same age range by 0.17 (V band) and
0.15 (I band) mag/Gyr. Moreover, we also suggest to use the difference in
magnitude between the main sequence turn-off and either the WDBTO (optical) or
the WDRTO (NIR). This age diagnostic is also independent of distance and
reddening. Once again the sensitivity in the K band (0.15-0.20 mag/Gyr) is on
average a factor of two higher than in the optical bands (0.10 [V band], 0.07

rationality. Logit dynamics is a decentralized algorithm in which a level of
irrationality (a.k.a. ""noise"") is introduced in players' behavior. In this
context, the solution concept of interest becomes the logit equilibrium, as
opposed to Nash equilibria. Logit equilibria are distributions over strategy
profiles that possess several nice properties, including existence and
uniqueness. However, there are games in which their computation may take time
exponential in the number of players. We therefore look at an approximate
version of logit equilibria, called metastable distributions, introduced by
Auletta et al. [SODA 2012]. These are distributions that remain stable (i.e.,
players do not go too far from it) for a super-polynomial number of steps
(rather than forever, as for logit equilibria). The hope is that these
distributions exist and can be reached quickly by logit dynamics.
  We identify a class of potential games, called asymptotically well-behaved,
for which the behavior of the logit dynamics is not chaotic as the number of
players increases so to guarantee meaningful asymptotic results. We prove that
any such game admits distributions which are metastable no matter the level of
noise present in the system, and the starting profile of the dynamics. These
distributions can be quickly reached if the rationality level is not too big
when compared to the inverse of the maximum difference in potential. Our proofs
build on results which may be of independent interest, including some spectral
characterizations of the transition matrix defined by logit dynamics for
generic games and the relationship of several convergence measures for Markov
chains.

star V410 Tau by means of a simultaneous Doppler- and Zeeman-Doppler Imaging.
Moreover we introduce a new line profile reconstruction method based on a

One of the key features of the line profile reconstruction is that the SVD line
profiles are amenable to radiative transfer modeling within our Zeeman-Doppler
Imaging code iMap. The code also utilizes a new iterative regularization scheme
which is independent of any additional surface constraints. To provide more
stability a vital part of our inversion strategy is the inversion of both
Stokes I and Stokes V profiles to simultaneously reconstruct the temperature
and magnetic field surface distribution of V410 Tau. A new image-shear analysis
is also implemented to allow the search for image and line profile distortions
induced by a differential rotation of the star. The magnetic field structure we
obtain for V410 Tau shows a good spatial correlation with the surface
temperature and is dominated by a strong field within the cool polar spot. The
Zeeman-Doppler maps exhibit a large-scale organization of both polarities
around the polar cap in the form of a twisted bipolar structure. The magnetic
field reaches a value of almost 2 kG within the polar region but smaller fields
are also present down to lower latitudes. The pronounced non-axisymmetric field
structure and the non-detection of a differential rotation for V410 Tau
supports the idea of an underlying $\alpha^2$-type dynamo, which is predicted
for weak-lined T Tauri stars.

superconducting system. If the tunneling coupling is weak, individual levels
are resolved and the conductance $G(V)$ at small temperatures is composed of a
set of resonant Lorentz peaks which cannot be described within perturbation
theory over tunnelling strength. We establish a general formula for their
widths and heights and show that the width of any peak scales as normal-state
tunnel conductance, while its height is $\lesssim 2e^2/h$ and depends only on
contact geometry and the spatial profile of the resonant Andreev level. We also
establish an exact formula for the single-channel conductance that takes the
whole Andreev spectrum into account. We use it to study the interference of
Andreev reflection processes through different levels. The effect is most
pronounced at low voltages, where an Andreev level at $E_j$ and its conjugate
at $-E_j$ interfere destructively. This interference leads to the quantization
of the zero-bias conductance: G(0) equals $2e^2/h$ (or 0) if there is (there is
not) a Majorana fermion in the spectrum, in agreement with previous results
from $S$-matrix theory. We also study $G(eV>0)$ for a system with a pair of
almost decoupled Majorana fermions with splitting $E_0$ and show that at lowest
$E_0$ there is a zero-bias Lorentz peak of width $W$ as expected for a single
Majorana fermion (a topological NS-junction) with a narrow dip of width
$E_0^2/W$ at zero bias, which ensures $G(0)=0$ (the NS-junction remains trivial
on a very small energy scale). As the coupling $W$ gets stronger, the dip
becomes narrower, which can be understood as enhanced decoupling of the remote
Majorana fermion. Then the zero-bias dip requires extremely low temperatures
$T\lesssim E_0^2/W$ to be observed.

essential part of the long-standing debate on the origin of high temperature
superconductivity in cuprates. Akin to the situation of heavy fermions, organic
superconductors and pnictides, it has been proposed that the pairing mechanism
in cuprates comes from fluctuations of a nearby quantum phase transition.
Recent evidence of charge modulation and the associated fluctuations in the
pseudogap phase of YBa_2Cu_3O_y make charge order a likely candidate for a
competing order. However, a thermodynamic signature of the charge ordering
phase transition is still lacking. Moreover, whether such charge order is one-
or two-dimensional is still controversial but pivotal for the understanding the
topology of the reconstructed Fermi surface. Here we address both issues by
measuring sound velocities in YBCO_6.55 in high magnetic fields, a powerful
thermodynamic probe to detect phase transitions. We provide the first
thermodynamic signature of the field-induced charge ordering phase transition
in YBCO allowing construction of a field-temperature phase diagram, which
reveals the competing nature of this charge order. The comparison of different
acoustic modes indicates that the charge modulation has a two-dimensional
character, thus imposing strong constraints on Fermi surface reconstruction
scenarios.

faceted solid-liquid interfaces based on atomistic simulations. The method is
demonstrated in an application to (111) interfaces in elemental Si, modeled
with the classical Stillinger-Weber potential. The approach makes use of an
adiabatic trapping procedure, and involves simulations of systems with
coexisting solid and liquid phases separated by faceted interfaces containing
islands with different sizes, for which the corresponding equilibrium
temperatures are computed. We demonstrate that the calculated coexistence
temperature is strongly affected by the geometry of the interface. We find that
island radius is inversely proportional to superheating, allowing us to compute
the step free energy by fitting simulation data within the formalism of
classical nucleation theory. The approach outlined in this work paves the way
to the calculation of step free energies relevant to the solidification of
faceted crystals from liquid mixtures, as encountered in nanowire growth by the
vapor-liquid-solid mechanism and in alloy casting. The present work also shows
that at low undercoolings the Stillinger-Weber interatomic potential for Si

stochastic alternative mechanism to natural selection, our simulation results
suggest local abundance of one sex, that during a persistent phase of

large gaps (ie no Higgs condensation to break the gauge ""symmetry"") and the
field strength fluctuates only weakly. We ask what kind of topological terms
can be added to the Lagrangian of such a weakly coupled gauge theory. In this
paper, we systematically construct quantized topological terms which are
generalization of the Chern-Simons terms and $F\wedge F$ terms, in space-time
dimensions $d$ and for any gauge groups (continuous or discrete), using each
element of the topological cohomology classes $H^{d+1}(BG,\Z)$ on the
classifying space $BG$ of the gauge group $G$.
  In 3$d$ or for finite gauge groups above 3$d$, the weakly coupled gauge
theories are gapped. So our results on topological terms can be viewed as a
systematic construction of gapped topologically ordered phases of weakly
coupled gauge theories. In other cases, the weakly coupled gauge theories are
gapless. So our results can be viewed as an attempt to systematically construct
different gapless phases of weakly coupled gauge theories.
  Amazingly, the bosonic symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with a
finite on-site symmetry group $G$ are also classified by the same
$H^{d+1}(BG,\Z)$. (SPT phases are gapped quantum phases with a symmetry and
trivial topological order.) In this paper, we show an explicit duality relation
between topological gauge theories with the quantized topological terms and the
bosonic SPT phases, for any finite group $G$ and in any dimensions; a result
first obtained by Levin and Gu. We also study the relation between topological
lattice gauge theory and the string-net states with non-trivial topological

Finally, we introduce ArcFitting, which is a tool that fits ArcEllipses to

simulated arcs and apply it to CFHTLS and HST images of tangential arcs around
clusters of galaxies. Our simple ArcEllipse model for the arc, associated to a
S\'ersic profile for the source, recovers the total signal in real images

recover visual estimates of length-to-width ratios of real arcs. Residual maps
between data and model images reveal the incidence of arc substructure. They
may thus be used as a diagnostic for arcs formed by the merging of multiple

were made almost continuously during 4 winters, from 2008 to 2011. The
point-to-point RMS of 1-day photometric lightcurves can be explained by a
combination of expected statistical noises, dominated by the photon noise up to
magnitude 14. This RMS is large, from 2.5 mmag at R=8 to 6% at R=14, because of
the small size of ASTEP South and the short exposure time (30 s). Statistical
noises should be considerably reduced using the large amount of collected data.
A 9.9-day period eclipsing binary is detected, with a magnitude R=9.85. The

of data with a better detrending algorithm should yield a sub-millimagnitude
precision for this folded lightcurve. Radial velocity follow-up observations
are conducted and reveal a F-M binary system. The detection of this 9.9-day
period system with a small instrument such as ASTEP South and the precision of
the folded lightcurve show the quality of Dome C for continuous photometric

lagrangian can be viewed as a power series in 1/\Lambda^2. The symmetry
involves interplay of the Higgs quartic interaction with the Higgs-Yukawa

determined the fractional dilution of the NIR ellipsoidal light curves of the
donor star from other emission sources in the system by comparing the
absorption features in the spectrum with field stars of known spectral type. We
constrained the donor star spectral type to K7 V - M1 V and determined that the
donor star contributed 54+/-27% of the H-band flux at the epoch of our
observations. This result underscores the conclusion that the donor star cannot
be assumed to be the only NIR emission source in quiescent X-ray binaries. The
H-band light curve shows a double-humped asymmetric modulation with extra flux
at orbital phase 0.75. The light curve was fit with a donor star model light
curve, taking into account a constant second flux component based on the
dilution analysis. We also fit models that included emission from the donor
star, a constant component from the accretion disk, and a phase-variable
component from the bright spot where the mass accretion stream impacts the
disk. These simple models with reasonable estimates for the component physical
parameters can fully account for the observed light curve, including the extra
emission at phase 0.75. From our fits, we constrained the binary inclination to
68 <= i <= 79 deg. This leads to a black hole mass of 6.9 <= M_BH <= 8.2 solar
masses. Long-term variations in the NIR light curve shape in XTE J1118+480 are
similar to those seen in other X-ray binaries and demonstrate the presence of

node at the electron Fermi surface as a $T=0$ structural phase transition
described in terms of nematic order is discussed. An effective low energy
theory that describes half-Dirac nodal Fermions and their coupling to Ising
nematic order that describes the phase transition is derived and analyzed using
renormalization group (RG) study of the large-$N_f$ version of the theory. The
inherent absence of Lorentz invariance of the theory leads to RG flow structure
where the velocities $v_F$ and $v_\Delta$ at the paired half-Dirac nodes
($1\overline{1}$ and $2\overline{2}$) in general flow differently under RG,
implying that the nodal electron gap is deformed and the $C_4$ symmetry is
broken, explaining the structural (orthogonal to orthorhombic) phase transition
at the quantum critical point (QCP). The theory is found to have Gaussian fixed
point $\lambda^*=0, (v_{\Delta}/v_F)^*=0$ with stable flow lines toward it,
suggesting a second order nematic phase transition. Interpreting the
fermion-Ising nematic boson interaction as a decay process of nematic Ising
order parameter scalar field fluctuations into half-Dirac nodal fermions, I
find that the theory surprisingly behaves as systems with dynamical critical
exponent $z = 1$, reflecting undamped quantum critical dynamics and emergent
fully relativistic field theory arising from the non(fully)-relativistic field
theory and is direct consequence of $(v_{\Delta}/v_F)^*=0$ fixed point. The
nematic critical fluctuations lead to remarkable change to the spectral
function peak where at a critical point $\lambda_c$, directly related to
nematic QCP, the central spectral peak collapses and splits into satellite
spectral peaks around nodal point. The vanishing of the zero modes density of
states leads to the undamped $z=1$ quantum critical dynamics.

the increased ratio of the caustic area relative to the critical area.
Additionally, we find that the observed separation between the two main mass
components enlarges the critical area by a factor of ~2. These geometrical
effects can account for the high number (density) of multiple images observed.
We find in numerical simulations, that only ~4% of the clusters (with M_{vir}>6
x 10^{14} h^{-1}M_{\odot}) exhibit as elongated critical curves as M0416.

This is the second in a series of papers about young, massive open clusters
observed using the VVV survey. We present the first study of six recently
discovered clusters. These clusters contain at least one newly discovered
Wolf-Rayet (WR) star. Methods: Following the methodology presented in the first
paper of the series, wide-field, deep JHKs VVV observations, combined with new
infrared spectroscopy, are employed to constrain fundamental parameters for a
subset of clusters. Results: We affirm that the six studied stellar groups are
real young (2-7 Myr) and massive (between 0.8 and 2.2 10^3 Msol) clusters. They
are highly obscured (Av ~ 5-24 mag) and compact (1-2 pc). In addition to WR
stars, two of the six clusters also contain at least one red supergiant star.
We claim the discovery of 8 new WR stars, and 3 stars showing WR-like emission
lines which could be classified WR or OIf. Preliminary analysis provides
initial masses of ~30-50 Msol for the WR stars. Finally,we discuss the spiral
structure of the Galaxy using as tracers the six new clusters together with the
previously studied VVV clusters.

used to assess the total enclosed mass, and even to constrain the dark matter
distribution. The globular cluster system of a galaxy is typically assumed to
be in dynamical equilibrium within the potential of the host galaxy. However
cluster galaxies are subjected to a rapidly evolving and, at times, violently
destructive tidal field. We investigate the impact of the harassment on the
dynamics of GCs surrounding early type cluster dwarfs, using numerical
simulations. We find that the dynamical behaviour of the GCS is strongly
influenced by the fraction of bound dark matter f_{DM} remaining in the galaxy.
Only when f_{DM} falls to ~15%, do stars and GCs begin to be stripped. Still
the observed GC velocity dispersion can be used to measure the true enclosed
mass to within a factor of 2, even when f_{DM} falls as low as ~3%. This is
possible partly because unbound GCs quickly separate from the galaxy body.
However even the distribution of {\it{bound}} GCs may spatially expand by a
factor of 2-3. Once f_{DM} falls into the <3% regime, the galaxy is close to
complete disruption, and GCS dynamics can no longer be used to reliably
estimate the enclosed mass. In this regime, the remaining bound GCS may
spatially expand by a factor of 4 to 8. It may be possible to test if a galaxy
is in this regime by measuring the dynamics of the stellar disk. We demonstrate
that if a stellar disk is rotationally supported, it is likely that a galaxy
has sufficient dark matter, that the dynamics of the GCS can be used to
reliably estimate the enclosed mass.

are 501 X-ray sources detected in the 0.3-8.0 keV band in the merged
observation or in one of the six individual observations; 399 sources are
located within the D_25 ellipse. The observed 0.3-8.0 keV luminosities of these

detection completeness limit within the D_25 ellipse is 5.5x10^{37} erg/s.
Based on the surface density of background active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and
detection completeness, we expect ~45 background AGNs among the catalog sources
(~15 within the D_25 ellipse). There are nine sources with luminosities greater
than 10^{39} erg/s, which are candidates for ultraluminous X-ray sources. The
nuclear source of NGC 4649 is a low-luminosity AGN, with an intrinsic 2.0-8.0
keV X-ray luminosity of 1.5x10^{38} erg/s. The X-ray colors suggest that the
majority of the catalog sources are low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). We find
that 164 of the 501 X-ray sources show long-term variability, indicating that
they are accreting compact objects. We discover four transient candidates and
another four potential transients. We also identify 173 X-ray sources (141

on Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based data; these LMXBs tend to be hosted
by red GCs. Although NGC 4649 has a much larger population of X-ray sources

arbitrary density profiles, and also for a circum-burst medium enriched with
electron-positron pairs. The presence of pairs enhances the fraction of shock

to test whether the fast decay of the high-energy light curve observed in

the ejection of one or more planets and the inward-scattering of the surviving

planetesimals. ""Mini-Oort clouds"" are thus formed from scattered planetesimals
whose orbits are frozen by the abrupt disappearance of the perturbing giant

gives beta_2 = 1.68 +/- 1.82 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter in
Mbh. When the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtain
similar slopes of 5.20 and 5.06 for the Mbh-sigma relation but significantly
different intercepts -- Mbh in early-type galaxies are about 2 times higher
than in late types at a given sigma. Within early-type galaxies, our fits to
Mbh(sigma) give Mbh that is about 2 times higher in galaxies with central core
profiles than those with central power-law profiles. Our Mbh-L and Mbh-Mbulge
relations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earlier
compilations. When the conventional quadrature method is used to determine the
intrinsic scatter in Mbh, our dataset shows weak evidence for increased scatter
at Mbulge < 10^{11} Msun or L_V < 10^{10.3} Lsun, while the scatter stays
constant for 10^{11} < Mbulge < 10^{12.3} Msun and 10^{10.3} < L_V < 10^{11.5}
Lsun. A Bayesian analysis indicates a larger sample of Mbh measurements would
be needed to detect any statistically significant trend in the scatter with
galaxy properties.

Furthermore, for sufficiently large but still smaller than unity bion fugacity
(as can be achieved upon an increase of the S^1_L size), at the critical
temperature we find two distinct peaks of the energy probability distribution,
indicative of a first-order transition, as has been seen in earlier simulations

and stellar mass functions of Lyman Break Galaxies. Our approach is based on
the assumption that the luminosity and stellar mass of a galaxy is related to
its dark matter halo assembly and gas infall rate. Specifically, galaxies
experience a burst of star formation at the halo assembly time, followed by a
constant star formation rate, representing a secular star formation activity
sustained by steady gas accretion. Star formation from steady gas accretion is
the dominant contribution to the galaxy UV luminosity at all redshifts. The
model is calibrated by constructing a galaxy luminosity versus halo mass
relation at $z=4$ via abundance matching. After this luminosity calibration,
the model naturally fits the $z=4$ stellar mass function, and correctly
predicts the evolution of both luminosity and stellar mass functions from $z=0$
to $z=8$. While the details of star formation efficiency and feedback are
hidden within our calibrated luminosity versus halo mass relation, our study
highlights that the primary driver of galaxy evolution across cosmic time is
the build-up of dark matter halos, without the need to invoke a redshift
dependent efficiency in converting gas into stars.

explored. These patchy kSZ power spectra are calculated from large 15 Deg x 15
Deg maps that are found to be necessary. Decreasing the size of these maps
biases the overall patchy kSZ power to higher values. We find that the

scalings of D_ell=3000^kSZ propto <z> and D_ell=3000^kSZ propto Delz^0.47 for
the mean redshift (<z>) of reionization and the duration (dz). Using the

unusually high equivalent widths (EWs) of the Lya line, observed occasionally
from starburst galaxies, especially at high redshifts. If the dust is locked up
inside high-density clouds dispersed in an empty intercloud medium, the Lya
photons could scatter off of the surfaces of the clouds, effectively having
their journey confined to the dustless medium. The continuum radiation, on the
other hand, does not scatter, and would thus be subject to absorption inside
the clouds. This scenario is routinely invoked when Lya EWs higher than what is
expected theoretically are observed, although the ideal conditions under which
the results are derived usually are not considered. Here we systematically
examine the relevant physical parameters in this idealized framework, testing
whether any astrophysically realistic scenarios may lead to such an effect. It
is found that although clumpiness indeed facilitates the escape of Lya, it is
highly unlikely that any real interstellar media should result in a
preferential escape of Lya over continuum radiation. Other possible causes are
discussed, and it is concluded that the observed high EWs are more likely to be
caused by cooling radiation from cold accretion and/or anisotropic escape of
the Lya radiation.

torsion: Let R be a regular algebra of finite type over a field K of
characteristic zero and let F be a module finitely generated over an R-algebra
of finite type. Given a maximal ideal m in R, let S be the coordinate ring of
the blowing-up of Spec(R) at the closed point m. Then F is flat over R
localized in m if and only if the tensor product of F with S over R is a
torsion-free module over R localized in m. If K is the field of reals or
complex numbers, we give a stronger criterion - without the regularity
assumption on R. We also show the corresponding results in the real- and

punishment has two substantial difficulties. First, a rare punishing cooperator
barely subverts the asocial society of freeriders, and second, natural
selection often eliminates punishing cooperators in the presence of
non-punishing cooperators (namely, ""second-order"" freeriders). We present a
game-theoretical model of social exclusion in which a punishing cooperator can
exclude freeriders from benefit sharing. We show that such social exclusion can
overcome the above-mentioned difficulties even if it is costly and stochastic.
The results do not require a genetic relationship, repeated interaction,

is its phase diagram. In the standard model, we observe three fundamentally
different types of behavior: QCD is in a confined phase at zero temperature,
while the electroweak sector of the standard model combines Coulomb and Higgs
phases. Our current understanding of the phase structure of gauge theories owes
much to the modern theory of phase transitions and critical phenomena, but has
developed into a subject of extensive study. After reviewing some fundamental
concepts of phase transitions and finite-temperature gauge theories, we discuss
some recent work that broadly extends our knowledge of the mechanisms that
determine the phase structure of gauge theories. A new class of models with a
rich phase structure has been discovered, generalizing our understanding of the
confinement-deconfinement transition in finite-temperature gauge theories.
Models in this class have space-time topologies with one or more compact
directions. On R^3 x S^1, the addition of double-trace deformations or periodic
adjoint fermions to a gauge theory can yield a confined phase in the region
where the S^1 circumference L is small, so that the coupling constant is small,
and semiclassical methods are applicable. In this region, Euclidean monopole
solutions, which are constituents of finite-temperature instantons, play a
crucial role in the calculation of a non-perturbative string tension. We review
the techniques use to analyze this new class of models and the results obtained
so far, as well as their application to finite-temperature phase structure,
conformal phases of gauge theories and the large-N limit.

preferentially at the step edge, forming linear clusters or chains, stabilized
by the cooperative effect of chemical bonds with the substrate and hydrogen
bonds. In contrast with flat Pt, at steps water molecules dissociate forming
mixed hydroxyl/water structures, through an autocatalytic mechanism promoted by
hydrogen bonding. Nuclear quantum effects contribute to stabilize partially

found to be Pi-periodic in CEP, with its phase strongly dependent on fragment
kinetic energy (and reversing its sign within the studied energy range),
indicating that the dissociation does not simply follow the CEP dependence of
maximum electric field, as a naive intuition might suggest. We also find that a
positively chirped pulse can lead to a higher dissociation probability than a

process or in a density. We analyze two types of likelihood ratio based
statistics which allow for exact finite sample inference and asymptotically
optimal detection: The maximum of the penalized square root of log likelihood
ratios (`penalized scan') evaluated over a certain sparse set of intervals, and
a certain average of log likelihood ratios (`condensed average likelihood
ratio'). We show that penalizing the {\sl square root} of the log likelihood
ratio - rather than the log likelihood ratio itself - leads to a simple penalty
term that yields optimal power. The thus derived penalty may prove useful for
other problems that involve a Brownian bridge in the limit. The second key tool
is an approximating set of intervals that is rich enough to allow for optimal
detection but which is also sparse enough to allow justifying the validity of
the penalization scheme simply via the union bound. This results in a
considerable simplification in the theoretical treatment compared to the usual
approach for this type of penalization technique, which requires establishing
an exponential inequality for the variation of the test statistic. Another
advantage of using the sparse approximating set is that it allows fast
computation in nearly linear time.

the penalized scan and of the condensed average likelihood ratio compared to

We provide quantitative expressions to infer the three-dimensional density

variance and spectral slope. We also investigate the relationship between the
column density variance and sonic Mach number (Ms) in the hydrodynamic (HD)

sonic Mach number, as obtained from the HD turbulence simulations. They are
related by the expression {\sigma}_{\ln N}^2 = A{\sigma}_{\ln\rho}^2 =
Aln(1+b^2M^2), suggested by Burkhart & Lazarian for the magnetohydrodynamic

solenoidal forcing) to 1 (purely compressive forcing). It is also discussed

increasing number of research areas. Processing the high dimensional data
incurs a high computational cost and is inherently inefficient since many of
the values that describe a data object are redundant due to noise and inner
correlations. Consequently, the dimensionality, i.e. the number of values that
are used to describe a data object, needs to be reduced prior to any other
processing of the data. The dimensionality reduction removes, in most cases,
noise from the data and reduces substantially the computational cost of
algorithms that are applied to the data.
  In this thesis, a novel coherent integrated methodology is introduced
(theory, algorithm and applications) to reduce the dimensionality of
high-dimensional datasets. The method constructs a diffusion process among the
data coordinates via a random walk. The dimensionality reduction is obtained
based on the eigen-decomposition of the Markov matrix that is associated with
the random walk. The proposed method is utilized for: (a) segmentation and
detection of anomalies in hyper-spectral images; (b) segmentation of
multi-contrast MRI images; and (c) segmentation of video sequences.
  We also present algorithms for: (a) the characterization of materials using
their spectral signatures to enable their identification; (b) detection of
vehicles according to their acoustic signatures; and (c) classification of
vascular vessels recordings to detect hyper-tension and cardio-vascular

evaluate reliable scale-invariance embedded in different sleep stages and

sleep stages are extracted from long-term EEG signals. For each stage the
scaling value distributes in a considerable wide range, which tell us that the
scaling behavior is subject- and sleep cycle- dependent. The average of the
scaling exponent values for wake segments is almost the same with that for REM
segments ($\sim 0.8$). Wake and REM stages have significant high value of
average scaling exponent, compared with that for light sleep stages ($\sim
0.7$). For the stride series, the original diffusion entropy (DE) and balanced
estimation of diffusion entropy (BEDE) give almost the same results for
de-trended series. Evolutions of local scaling invariance show that the
physiological states change abruptly, though in the experiments great efforts
have been done to keep conditions unchanged. Global behaviors of a single
physiological signal may lose rich information on physiological states.
Methodologically, BEDE can evaluate with considerable precision
scale-invariance in very short time series ($\sim 10^2$), while the original DE
method sometimes may underestimate scale-invariance exponents or even fail in
detecting scale-invariant behavior. The BEDE method is sensitive to trends in
time series. Existence of trend may leads to a unreasonable high value of
scaling exponent, and consequent mistake conclusions.

these form fields are just additive renormalizations of the cosmological

are coupled to membranes charged under them, their configurations are unstable:
by a process analogous to Schwinger pair production the field space-filling
flux increases. This reduces the cosmological constant, and preserves the null

goes on the probability for further membrane nucleation {\it increases}, in

ceases to induce further transitions. Thus, in such models spaces with tiny
positive vacuum energy are ultimately unstable, but the instability may be slow

of dimension for metric spaces, the so called topological Hausdorff dimension.
They proved that it is precisely the right notion to describe the Hausdorff
dimension of the level sets of the generic real-valued continuous function (in
the sense of Baire category) defined on a compact metric space $K$.
  The goal of this paper is to determine the Hausdorff dimension of the fibers
of the generic continuous function from $K$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. In order to do
so, we define the $n$th inductive topological Hausdorff dimension, $\dim_{t^nH}
K$. Let $\dim_H K$, $\dim_t K$ and $C_n(K)$ denote the Hausdorff and
topological dimension of $K$ and the Banach space of the continuous functions
from $K$ to $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show that $\sup_{y\in \mathbb{R}^n}
\dim_{H}f^{-1}(y) = \dim_{t^nH} K -n$ for the generic $f \in C_n(K)$, provided
that $\dim_t K\geq n$, otherwise every fiber is finite.
  In order to prove the above theorem we give some equivalent definitions for
the inductive topological Hausdorff dimensions, which can be interesting in
their own right. Here we use techniques coming from the theory of topological
dimension.
  We show that the supremum is actually attained on the left hand side of the
above equation.
  We characterize those compact metric spaces $K$ for which $\dim_{H}
f^{-1}(y)=\dim_{t^nH}K-n$ for the generic $f\in C_n(K)$ and the generic $y\in
f(K)$. We also generalize a result of Kirchheim by showing that if $K$ is
self-similar and $\dim_t K\geq n$ then $\dim_{H} f^{-1}(y)=\dim_{t^nH}K-n$ for
the generic $f\in C_n(K)$ for every $y\in \inter f(K)$.

required magnitude and direction information of the solution error.
Unfortunately, a recovered Hessian from a linear finite element approximation
is nonconvergent in general as the mesh is refined. It has been observed
numerically that adaptive meshes based on such a nonconvergent recovered
Hessian can nevertheless lead to an optimal error in the finite element
approximation. This also explains why Hessian recovery is still widely used
despite its nonconvergence. In this paper we develop an error bound for the
linear finite element solution of a general boundary value problem under a mild
assumption on the closeness of the recovered Hessian to the exact one.
Numerical results show that this closeness assumption is satisfied by the
recovered Hessian obtained with commonly used Hessian recovery methods.
Moreover, it is shown that the finite element error changes gradually with the
closeness of the recovered Hessian. This provides an explanation on how a
nonconvergent recovered Hessian works in mesh adaptation.

Most
of the literature on host-pathogen coevolution focuses on this phenomenon, and
looks for consequent evidence of coevolutionary arms races. An alternative
strategy, less often considered in the literature, is to deter rapid
evolutionary change by the opponent. To study how this can be done, we
construct an evolutionary game between a controller that must process
information, and an adversary that can tamper with this information processing.
In this game, a species can foil its antagonist by processing information in a
way that is hard for the antagonist to manipulate. We show that the structure
of the information processing system induces a fitness landscape on which the
adversary population evolves. Complex processing logic can carve long, deep
fitness valleys that slow adaptive evolution in the adversary population. We
suggest that this type of defensive complexity on the part of the vertebrate
adaptive immune system may be an important element of coevolutionary dynamics
between pathogens and their vertebrate hosts. Furthermore, we cite evidence
that the immune control logic is phylogenetically conserved in mammalian
lineages. Thus our model of defensive complexity suggests a new hypothesis for
the lower rates of evolution for immune control logic compared to other immune
structures.

  (arXiv:1111.0478v2 [quant-ph])",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum information theory is a very young area of research offering a lot of
challenging open questions to be tackled by ambitious upcoming physicists. One
such problem is addressed in this thesis. Recently, several protocols have
emerged which exploit both continuous variables and discrete variables. On the
one hand, outperforming many of the established pure continuous variable or
discrete variable schemes, these hybrid approaches offer new opportunities.
However, on the other hand, they also lead to new, intricate, as yet
uninvestigated, phenomena.
  An important ingredient of several of these hybrid protocols is a new kind of
entanglement: The hybrid entanglement between continuous variable and discrete
variable quantum systems, which is studied in detail in this work. An
exhaustive analysis of this kind of entanglement is performed, where the focus
is on bipartite entanglement. Nevertheless, also issues regarding multipartite
hybrid entanglement are briefly discussed. The quintessence of this thesis is a
new classification scheme which distinguishes between effective discrete
variable hybrid entanglement and so-called true hybrid entanglement. However,
along the way, also other questions are addressed, which have emerged during
the studies. For example, entanglement witnessing is discussed not only for
hybrid entangled states, but also for fully continuous variable two-mode
Schroedinger cat states. Furthermore, subtleties regarding entanglement
witnessing in a certain kind of mixed states are examined. Not only theoretical
classification and analysis of hybrid entangled states are discussed, but also
their generation is presented and a few applications are demonstrated.

and albedo measurements were based on the Standard Thermal Model, using inputs

for 4722 of the 5120 AcuA asteroids, have semimajor axes of 2.06 to 3.27 AU.
AcuA provides a complete data set of all main belt asteroids brighter than the
absolute magnitude of H < 10.3, which corresponds to the diameter of d > 20 km.
We confirmed that the albedo distribution of the main belt asteroids is
strongly bimodal as was already known from the past observations, and that the
bimodal distribution occurs not only in the total population, but also within
inner, middle, and outer regions of the main belt. We found that the small
asteroids have much more variety in albedo than the large asteroids. In spite
of the albedo transition process like space weathering, the heliocentric
distribution of the mean albedo of asteroids in each taxonomic type is nearly
flat. The mean albedo of the total, on the other hand, gradually decreases with
an increase in semimajor axis. This can be explained by the compositional ratio
of taxonomic types; that is, the proportion of dark asteroids such as C- and
D-types increases, while that of bright asteroids such as S-type decreases,
with increasing heliocentric distance. The heliocentric distributions of
X-subclasses: E-, M-, and P-type, which can be divided based on albedo values,
are also examined. P-type, which is the major component in X-types, are
distributed throughout the main belt regions, and the abundance of P-type
increases beyond 3 AU. This distribution is similar to that of C- or D-types.

field $\F$ of large characteristic. In this paper we establish the following
dichotomy: either $P$ is a moderate asymmetric expander in the sense that
$|P(A,B)| \gg |\F|$ whenever $A, B \subset \F$ are such that $|A| |B| \geq C
|\F|^{2-1/8}$ for a sufficiently large $C$, or else $P$ takes the form $P(x,y)

is a reasonably satisfactory classification of polynomials of two variables
that moderately expand (either symmetrically or asymmetrically). We obtain a
similar classification for weak expansion (in which one has $|P(A,A)| \gg
|A|^{1/2} |\F|^{1/2}$ whenever $|A| \geq C |\F|^{1-1/16}$), and a partially
satisfactory classification for almost strong asymmetric expansion (in which
$|P(A,B)| = (1-O(|\F|^{-c})) |\F|$ when $|A|, |B| \geq |\F|^{1-c}$ for some
small absolute constant $c>0$).
  The main new tool used to establish these results is an algebraic regularity
lemma that describes the structure of dense graphs generated by definable
subsets over finite fields of large characteristic. This lemma strengthens the
Sz\'emeredi regularity lemma in the algebraic case, in that while the latter

  of Freedom, Message Assignment, and Fractional Reuse","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) transmission is an infrastructural enhancement
under consideration for next generation wireless networks. In this work, the
capacity gain achieved through CoMP transmission is studied in various models
of wireless networks that have practical significance. The capacity gain is
analyzed through the degrees of freedom (DoF) criterion. The DoF available for
communication provides an analytically tractable way to characterize the
capacity of interference channels. The considered channel model has K
transmitter/receiver pairs, and each receiver is interested in one unique
message from a set of K independent messages. Each message can be available at
more than one transmitter. The maximum number of transmitters at which each
message can be available, is defined as the cooperation order M. For fully
connected interference channels, it is shown that the asymptotic per user DoF,
as K goes to infinity, remains at 1/2 as M is increased from 1 to 2.
Furthermore, the same negative result is shown to hold for all M > 1 for any
message assignment that satisfies a local cooperation constraint. On the other
hand, when the assumption of full connectivity is relaxed to local
connectivity, and each transmitter is connected only to its own receiver as
well as L neighboring receivers, it is shown that local cooperation is optimal.
The asymptotic per user DoF is shown to be at least max {1/2,2M/(2M+L)} for
locally connected channels, and is shown to be 2M/(2M+1) for the special case
of Wyner's asymmetric model where L=1. An interesting feature of the proposed
achievability scheme is that it relies on simple zero-forcing transmit beams
and does not require symbol extensions. Also, to achieve the optimal per user
DoF for Wyner's model, messages are assigned to transmitters in an asymmetric
fashion unlike traditional assignments where message i has to be available at
transmitter i.

non-magnetic, non-binary (""normal"") stars in our sample when they reach the
ZAMS, and compared them to various catalogues of the vsini of main-sequence
stars. First, we observe that magnetic HAeBe stars are much slower rotators
than normal stars, indicating that they have been more efficiently braked than
the normal stars. In fact, the magnetic stars have already lost most of their
angular momentum, despite their young ages (lower than 1 Myr for some of them).
Secondly, our analysis suggests that the low mass (1.5 < M < 5 Msun) normal
HAeBe stars evolve with constant angular momentum towards the ZAMS, while the
high-mass normal HAeBe stars (M > 5 Msun) are losing angular momentum. We
propose that winds, which are expected to be stronger in massive stars, are at
the origin of this phenomenon.

of the gravitational interactions.
  Such an odd behavior can be found also in electromagnetism, when one computes
the propagation of the electric fields generated by a set of uniformly moving
charges. As a matter of fact the Li\'enard-Weichert retarded potential leads to
a formula indistinguishable from the one obtained assuming that the electric
field propagates with infinite velocity. Feyman explanation for this apparent
paradox was based on the fact that uniform motions last indefinitely.

time/space evolution of the electric field generated by an uniformely moving

Assuming normality and independence of the observations we relate the efficient
frontier computed empirically to the ""true"" efficient frontier. Our
computations show that there is a separation of the errors induced by
estimating the mean of the observations and estimating the covariance matrix.
In particular, the price paid for estimating the covariance matrix is an
underestimation of the variance by a factor roughly equal to 1-p/n. Therefore
the risk of the optimal population solution is underestimated when we estimate
it by solving a similar quadratic program with estimated parameters. We also
characterize the statistical behavior of linear functionals of the empirical
optimal vector and show that they are biased estimators of the corresponding
population quantities.

wavelengths are affected by atmospheric absorption and consequent emission. The
low and high frequency (sky noise) fluctuations of atmospheric performance
imply careful observational strategies and/or instrument technical solutions.
Measurements of atmospheric emission spectra are necessary for accurate
calibration procedures as well as for site testing statistics. CASPER2, an
instrument to explore the 90-450 GHz (3-15 1/cm) spectral region, was developed
and verified its operation in the Alps. A Martin-Puplett Interferometer (MPI)
operates comparing sky radiation, coming from a field of view (fov) of 28
arcminutes (FWHM) collected by a 62-cm in diameter Pressman-Camichel telescope,
with a reference source. The two output ports of the interferometer are
detected by two bolometers cooled down to 300 mK inside a wet cryostat. Three
different and complementary interferometric techniques can be performed with
CASPER2: Amplitude Modulation (AM), Fast-Scan (FS) and Phase Modulation (PM).
An altazimuthal mount allows the sky pointing, possibly co-alligned to the
optical axis of the 2.6-m in diameter telescope of MITO (Millimetre and
Infrared Testagrigia Observatory, Italy). Optimal timescale to average acquired
spectra is inferred by Allan variance analysis at 5 fiducial frequencies. We
present the motivation for and design of the atmospheric spectrometer CASPER2.
The adopted procedure to calibrate the instrument and preliminary performance
of the instrument are described. Instrument capabilities were checked during
the summer observational campaign at MITO in July 2010 by measuring atmospheric

dose is given, which is designed to bring the International Normalisation Ratio
(INR) to within therapeutic range. Then a stable maintenance dose is given to
maintain the INR within therapeutic range. In the United Kingdom (UK) the
loading dose is usually given as three individual daily doses, the standard
loading dose being 10mg on days one and two and 5mgs on day three, which can be
varied at the discretion of the clinician. However, due to the large
inter-individual variation in the response to Warfarin therapy, it is difficult
to identify which patients will reach the narrow therapeutic window for target
INR, and which will be above or below the therapeutic window. The aim of this
research was to develop a methodology using a neural networks classification
algorithm and data mining techniques to predict for a given loading dose and
patient characteristics if the patient is more likely to achieve target INR or
more likely to be above or below therapeutic range.
  Multilayer perceptron (MLP) and 10-fold stratified cross validation
algorithms were used to determine an artificial neural network to classify
patients' response to their initial Warfarin loading dose. The resulting neural
network model correctly classifies an individual's response to their Warfarin
loading dose over 80% of the time. As well as taking into account the initial
loading dose, the final model also includes demographic, genetic and a number
of other potential confounding factors. With this model clinicians can
predetermine whether a given loading regimen, along with specific patient
characteristics will achieve a therapeutic response for a particular patient.
Thus tailoring the loading dose regimen to meet the individual needs of the
patient and reducing the risk of adverse drug reactions associated with
Warfarin.

  Ad-hoc Networks","Submited by error",,,,"cs.NI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The routing performance in Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) relies on the
co-operation of the individual nodes that constitute the network. The existence
of misbehaving nodes may paralyze the routing operation in MANETs. To overcome
this behavior, the trustworthiness of the network nodes should be considered in
the route selection process combined with the hop count. The trustworthiness is
achieved by measuring the trust value for each node in the network. In this
paper, a new protocol based on self monitoring (agent-based) and following the
dynamic source routing (DSR) algorithm is presented. This protocol is called
Agent-Based Trusted Dynamic Source Routing (ATDSR) Protocol for MANETs. The
objective of this protocol is to manage trust information locally with minimal
overhead in terms of extra messages and time delay. This objective is achieved
through installing in each participated node in the network a multi-agent
system (MAS). MAS consists of two types of agents: monitoring agent (MOA) and
routing agent (ROA). A new mathematical and more realistic objective model for
measuring the trust value is introduced. This model is weighted by both number
and size of routed packets to reflect the selective forwarding behavior of a
node. The performance evaluation via simulation shows that our protocol is
better than standard and trusted DSR. The simulation is done over a variety of
environmental conditions such as number of malicious nodes, host density and
movement rates.

and their application in most communications systems. In this paper, we present
a new application of our iterative decoder on the GPCB (Generalized Parallel
Concatenated Block codes) which uses cyclic permutations. We introduce a new
variant of the component decoder. After extensive simulation; the obtained
result is very promising compared with several existing methods. We evaluate
the effects of various parameters component codes, interleaver size, block
size, and the number of iterations. Three interesting results are obtained; the
first one is that the performances in terms of BER (Bit Error Rate) of the new
constituent decoder are relatively similar to that of original one. Secondly
our turbo decoding outperforms another turbo decoder for some linear block
codes. Thirdly the proposed iterative decoding of GPCB-BCH (75, 51) is about
2.1dB from its Shannon limit.

theory and resemble spaces of differentiable functions, Besov spaces or Bessel

battery operated sensor cooperatively transmit a common message to a distant

allocation) policy which maximizes the total throughput for a given deadline.
First, we address the case in which the storage capacity of the energy
harvesting sensor is infinite. In this context, we identify the necessary
conditions for such optimal transmission policy. On their basis, we first show
that the problem is convex. Then we go one step beyond and prove that (i) the
optimal power allocation for the energy harvesting sensor can be computed
independently; and (ii) it unequivocally determines (and allows to compute)
that of the battery operated one. Finally, we generalize the analysis for the
case of finite storage capacity. Performance is assessed by means of computer
simulations. Particular attention is paid to the impact of finite storage
capacity and long-term battery degradation on the achievable throughput.

programming in general and non-monotonic reasoning in particular. There has
been many efforts to extend stable model semantics so that answer set programs
can use a more extensive syntax. To such endeavor, the community of
non-monotonic reasoning has introduced extensions such as equilibrium models
and FLP semantics. However, both of these extensions suffer from two problems:
intended models according to such extensions (1) are not guaranteed to be
minimal, and (2) more importantly, may have self-justifications (i.e., the
justification for pertinence of an atom in an intended model may be its own
pertinence). Both of these properties directly violate the spirit of stable
model semantics. Therefore, we believe that we need a new extension of stable
model semantics that guarantees both minimality and being strongly grounded.
  This paper introduces one such extension using two different approaches:
firstly, by extending the goal-reachability interpretation of logic programs to
the full propositional language and, secondly, using derivability in
intuitionistic propositional logic. We show that both these approaches give the
same semantics, that we call the supported semantics. Moreover, using the first
approach, we also extend well-founded semantics to full propositional language.
Furthermore, we discuss how our supported models relate to other existing
semantics for non-monotonic reasoning including the equilibrium models. Last,
but not the least, we discuss the complexity of reasoning about supported
models and show that all interesting reasoning tasks (such as brave/cautious
reasoning) are PSPACE-complete. Therefore, supported model semantics is a much
more expressive semantics then the existing semantics such as equlibrium models
(that have reasoning procedures in $\Delta^P_3$).

Without these fast points, the model is related to the diffusion in

Spitzer counterparts, we use radiative transfer models to derive information
about the basic stellar and circumstellar parameters.We find that about 75% of
the Herschel-detected YSOs are Class 0 protostars.The luminosities of the
Herschel-detected YSOs with SED fits are restricted to values of <=5400 Lsun,
their masses (estimated from the radiative transfer modeling) range from about
1 Msun to 10 Msun.Taking the observational limits into account and
extrapolating the observed number of Herschel-detected protostars over the IMF
suggest that the star formation rate of the CNC is about 0.017 Msun/yr.The
spatial distribution of the Herschel YSO candidates is highly inhomogeneous and
does not follow the distribution of cloud mass.Most Herschel YSO candidates are
found at the irradiated edges of clouds and pillars.This provides support to
the picture that the formation of this latest stellar generation is triggered
by the advancing ionization fronts.The currently ongoing star formation process
forms only low-mass and intermediate-mass stars, but no massive stars.The
far-infrared fluxes of the famous object EtaCar are about a factor of two lower

the chemistry, composition, and spectra of extrasolar giant planets both from a
thermochemical-equilibrium perspective and from consideration of disequilibrium
processes like photochemistry and transport-induced quenching. We find that
although CO is predicted to be a major atmospheric constituent on hot Jupiters
for all C/O ratios, other oxygen-bearing molecules like H2O and CO2 are much
more abundant when C/O < 1, whereas CH4, HCN, and C2H2 gain significantly in
abundance when C/O > 1. Disequilibrium processes tend to enhance the abundance
of CH4, NH3, HCN, and C2H2 over a wide range of C/O ratios. We compare the
results of our models with secondary-eclipse photometric data from the Spitzer
Space Telescope and conclude that (1) disequilibrium models with C/O ~ 1 are
consistent with spectra of WASP-12b, XO-1b, and CoRoT-2b, confirming the
possible carbon-rich nature of these planets, (2) spectra from HD 189733b are
consistent with C/O ~< 1, but as the assumed metallicity is increased above
solar, the required C/O ratio must increase toward 1 to prevent too much H2O
absorption, (3) species like HCN can have a significant influence on spectral
behavior in the 3.6 and 8.0 um Spitzer channels, potentially providing even
more opacity than CH4 when C/O > 1, and (4) the very high CO2 abundance
inferred for HD 189733b from near-infrared observations cannot be explained
through equilibrium or disequilibrium chemistry in a H2-dominated atmosphere.
We discuss possible formation mechanisms for carbon-rich hot Jupiters. The C/O
ratio and bulk atmospheric metallicity provide important clues regarding the
formation and evolution of the giant planets.

we provide a general effective criterion to understand whether the changes
introduced by a view update can be propagated to the underlying database

  Afterwards, we show how determinacy under constraints can be checked, and
rewritings effectively found, in three different relevant scenarios in the
absence of view constraints. First, we settle the long-standing open issue of
how to solve the view update problem in a multi-relational database with views
that are projections of joins of relations, and we do so in a more general
setting where views are defined by arbitrary conjunctive queries and database
constraints are stratified embedded dependencies. Next, we study a setting
based on horizontal decompositions of a single database relation, where views
are defined by selections on possibly interpreted attributes (e.g., arithmetic
comparisons) in the presence of domain constraints over the database schema.
Lastly, we look into another multi-relational database setting, where views are
defined in an expressive ""Type"" Relational Algebra based on the n-ary

existence and uniqueness of a periodic orbit and determine a subset of its
basin of attraction. While the existence of such a contraction metric is
equivalent to the existence of an exponentially stable periodic orbit, the
explicit construction of the metric is a difficult problem.
  In this paper, the construction of such a contraction metric is achieved by
formulating it as an equivalent problem, namely a feasibility problem in
semidefinite optimization. The contraction metric, a matrix-valued function, is
constructed as a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) function, which is affine on
each simplex of a triangulation of the phase space. The contraction conditions
are formulated as conditions on the values at the vertices.
  The paper states a semidefinite optimization problem. We prove on the one
hand that a feasible solution of the optimization problem determines a CPA
contraction metric and on the other hand that the optimization problem is
always feasible if the system has an exponentially stable periodic orbit and
the triangulation is fine enough. An objective function can be used to obtain a
bound on the largest Floquet exponent of the periodic orbit.

complemented by discrete element simulations. The particles develop an
orientational order. In the steady state the time and ensemble averaged
direction of the main axis of the particles encloses a small angle with the
streamlines. This shear alignment angle is independent of the applied shear
rate, and it decreases with increasing grain aspect ratio. At the grain level
the steady state is characterized by a net rotation of the particles, as
dictated by the shear flow. The distribution of particle rotational velocities
was measured both in the steady state and also during the initial transients.

significantly impacted by the products of chemistry in interstellar ices. In
this study, we report the construction of a full macroscopic Monte Carlo model
of both the gas-phase chemistry and the chemistry occurring in the icy mantles
of interstellar grains. Our model treats icy grain mantles in a layer-by-layer
manner, which incorporates laboratory data on ice desorption correctly. The ice
treatment includes a distinction between a reactive ice surface and an inert
bulk. The treatment also distinguishes between zeroth and first order
desorption, and includes the entrapment of volatile species in more refractory
ice mantles. We apply the model to the investigation of the chemistry in hot
cores, in which a thick ice mantle built up during the previous cold phase of
protostellar evolution undergoes surface reactions and is eventually
evaporated. For the first time, the impact of a detailed multilayer approach to
grain mantle formation on the warm-up chemistry is explored. The use of a
multilayer ice structure has a mixed impact on the abundances of organic
species formed during the warm-up phase. For example, the abundance of gaseous
HCOOCH3 is lower in the multilayer model than in previous grain models that do
not distinguish between layers (so-called ""two phase"" models). Other gaseous
organic species formed in the warm-up phase are affected slightly. Finally, we
find that the entrapment of volatile species in water ice can explain the
two-jump behavior of H2CO previously found in observations of protostars.

sensitive to the spontaneous and explicit chiral symmetry breaking of QCD, such
as pion-pion, pion-kaon, pion-nucleon, antikaon-nucleon and Goldstone boson
scattering off D-mesons. The fruitful interplay of theory, experiment and
lattice QCD is emphasized. I point out what has to be done in these fields to
gain further insight into these fundamental parameters.

\times {\mathbb R}$, and rescale its ${\mathbb R}$-component by a factor
$\lambda^2$. We show that generically, for large $\lambda$, the
Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex is isomorphic to the one for $f$ and the
metric restricted to ${\mu^{-1}(0)}$, with grading shifted by one. On the other
hand, let $\lambda\to 0$, we obtain another chain complex, which is
geometrically quite different but has the same homology as the singular
homology of $\mu^{-1}(0)$ and the isomorphism between them is provided by the
homotopy by varying $\lambda$. Our proofs contain both the implicit function
theorem on Banach manifolds and geometric singular perturbation theory.

supercooled helium at low temperature. The absolute temperature and the volume
fraction of helium, which is dominant at temperature larger than the phase
change temperature, are the state quantities. The predictive theory accounts
for local interactions at the microscopic level, involving the gradient of
$\beta$. The nonlinear heat flux in the supercooled phase results from a
Norton-Hoff potential. We prove that the resulting set of partial differential
equations has solutions within a convenient analytical frame.

We
define the topological expansion of a topological space via local
multi-homeomorphism over coproduct topology, and we prove that the coproduct
family associated to any fractal family of topological spaces is expanding. In
particular, we prove that the more a topological space expands, the finer the
topology of its indexed states is. Using multi-homeomorphisms over associated
coproduct topological spaces, we define a locally expandable topological space
and we prove that a locally expandable topological space has a topological
expansion. Specifically, we prove that the expanding fractal manifold is
locally expandable and has a natural topological expansion.

  all degenerate cases as claimed",,,,"cs.CG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Polygon clipping is a frequent operation in Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
methods, Computer Graphics, GIS, and CAD. In fact, clipping algorithms are said
to be one of the most important operations in computer graphics. Thus,
efficient and general polygon clipping algorithms are of great importance.
Greiner et al. developed a time efficient algorithm which could clip arbitrary
polygons, including concave and self intersecting polygons. However, the
Greiner-Hormann algorithm does not properly handle degenerate cases, without
the undesirable need for perturbing vertices. We present an extension to the
Greiner-Hormann polygon clipping algorithm which properly deals with degenerate
cases. We combine the method proposed by Kim et al. and the method mentioned by
Liu et al. to remove or properly label degenerate cases. Additionally, the
algorithm presented avoids the need for calculating midpoints, doesn't require
additional entry/exit flags, and avoids changing the vertex data structure used
in the original Greiner-Hormann algorithm, which was required by the extension
presented by Kim et al.
