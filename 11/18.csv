quasi--coherent sheaves on $X$ is known that admits arbitrary direct products.
However their structure seems to be rather mysterious. In the present paper we
will describe the structure of the product object of a family of locally
torsion-free objects in $\mathfrak{Qcoh}(X)$, for $X$ an integral scheme.
Several applications are provided. For instance it is shown that the class of
flat quasi--coherent sheaves on a Dedekind scheme $X$ is closed under arbitrary
direct products, and that the class of all locally torsion-free quasi--coherent
sheaves induces a hereditary torsion theory on $\mathfrak{Qcoh}(X)$. Finally
torsion-free covers are shown to exist in $\mathfrak{Qcoh}(X)$.

attracted much attention due to their potential for future electronic
applications. They not only present the best planar electrostatic control in a
device, but also lend themselves readily for dielectric engineering. In this
work, we experimentally investigated the dielectric effect on the Raman and
photoluminescence (PL) spectra of monolayer MoS2 by comparing samples with and
without HfO2 on top by atomic layer deposition (ALD). Based on considerations
of the thermal, doping, strain and dielectric screening influences, it is found
that the red shift in the Raman spectrum largely stems from modulation doping
of MoS2 by the ALD HfO2, and the red shift in the PL spectrum is most likely
due to strain imparted on MoS2 by HfO2. Our work also suggests that due to the
intricate dependence of band structure of monolayer MoS2 on strain, one must be
cautious to interpret its Raman and PL spectroscopy.

putting emphasis on its nonperturbative aspects. The method enables to find
nontrivial fixed points in quantum field theoretic models which make them free
from divergences and leads to the concept of asymptotic safety. It can be
considered as a generalization of the asymptotic freedom which plays a key role
in the perturbative renormalization. We summarize and give a short discussion
of some important models, which are asymptotically safe such as the Gross-Neveu
model, the nonlinear $\sigma$ model, the sine-Gordon model, and we consider the
model of quantum Einstein gravity which seems to show asymptotic safety, too.
We also give a detailed analysis of infrared behavior of such scalar models
where a spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place. The deep infrared behaviorof
the broken phase cannot be treated within the framework of perturbative
calculations. We demonstrate that there exists an infrared fixed point in the
broken phase whichcreates a new scaling regime there, however its structure is
hidden by the singularity of the renormalization group equations. The theory
spaces of these models show several similar properties, namely the models have
the same phase and fixed point structure. The quantum Einstein gravity also
exhibits similarities when considering the global aspects of its theory space
since the appearing two phases there show analogies with the symmetric and the
broken phases of the scalar models. These results be nicely uncovered by the
functional renormalization group method.

information without considering the semantic and lexical relations between the
adjectives and the feature nouns appropriate to a given domain. In this paper,
we present a classification of adjectives by polarity, and we analyze
adjectives that are undetermined in the absence of contexts. Our research
should be useful for accurately predicting semantic orientations of opinion
sentences, and should be taken into account before relying on an automatic

minimum throughput requirements. Most existing works proposed stationary
spectrum sharing policies, in which users transmit at fixed power levels. Since
users transmit simultaneously under stationary policies, to fulfill minimum
throughput requirements, they need to transmit at high power levels to overcome
interference. To improve energy efficiency, we construct nonstationary spectrum
sharing policies, in which the users transmit at time-varying power levels.
Specifically, we focus on TDMA (time-division multiple access) policies in
which one user transmits at each time (but not in a round-robin fashion). The
proposed policy can be implemented by each user running a low-complexity
algorithm in a decentralized manner. It achieves high energy efficiency even
when the users have erroneous and binary feedback about their interference
levels. Moreover, it can adapt to the dynamic entry and exit of users. The
proposed policy is also deviation-proof, namely autonomous users will find it
in their self-interests to follow it. Compared to existing policies, the
proposed policy can achieve an energy saving of up to 90% when the number of
users is high.

Dynamics Observatory, SDO) has provided some insight into the non-thermal
energy content of the outer solar atmosphere. However, many questions remain
about the true magnitude of the energy flux carried by these waves. Here we
explore the apparent discrepancy in the resolved coronal Alfvenic wave
amplitude (~0.5km/s) measured by the Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (CoMP)
compared to those of the Hinode and the SDO near the limb (~20km/s). We use a
blend of observational data and a simple forward model of Alfvenic wave
propagation to resolve this discrepancy and determine the Alfvenic wave energy
content of the corona. Our results indicate that enormous line-of-sight
superposition within the coarse spatio-temporal sampling of CoMP hides the
strong wave flux observed by Hinode and SDO and leads to the large non-thermal
line broadening observed. While this scenario has been assumed in the past, our
observations with CoMP of a strong correlation between the non-thermal line
broadening with the low amplitude, low frequency Alfvenic waves observed in the
corona provide the first direct evidence of a wave-related non-thermal line
broadening. By reconciling the diverse measurements of Alfvenic waves we
establish large coronal non-thermal linewidths as direct signatures of the
hidden, or ""dark"", energy content in the corona, and provide preliminary
constraints on the energy content of the wave motions observed.

The ability to resolve the quantum-limited signal from a remote source against

by the Jaynes Cummings model. We argue that the presence of pure dephasing
noise in such a qubit-resonator system will also induce an energy relaxation
mechanism via a fluctuating dipole coupling term. This random modulation of the
coupling is seen to lead to rich physical behavior. For non-Markovian noise,
the coupling can either worsen or alleviate decoherence depending on the
initial conditions. The magnetization noise leads to behavior resembling the
collapse and revival of Rabi oscillations. For a broad distribution of noise
couplings, the frequency of these oscillations depends on the mean noise
strength. We describe this behavior semi-analytically and find it to be
independent of the number of fluctuators. This phenomenon could be used as an
in situ probe of the noise characteristics.

burning fronts in long MM crystals. Near spin-tunneling resonances the decay
rate is also affected by the dipolar field (self-consistent with the switching

fronts of tunneling in which the magnetization adjusts in such a way that the

return current in the target, and this current configuration generates strong

system, the recent network coding (NC) paradigm proposes to implement simple

concept of ""encoding"" a message beyond source coding (for compression) and
channel coding (for protection against errors and losses). It has been shown to
increase network throughput compared to traditional networks implementation, to
reduce delay and to provide robustness to transmission errors and network
dynamics. These features are so appealing for multimedia applications that they
have spurred a large research effort towards the development of
multimedia-specific NC techniques. This paper reviews the recent work in NC for
multimedia applications and focuses on the techniques that fill the gap between
NC theory and practical applications. It outlines the benefits of NC and
presents the open challenges in this area. The paper initially focuses on
multimedia-specific aspects of network coding, in particular delay, in-network
error control, and media-specific error control. These aspects permit to handle
varying network conditions as well as client heterogeneity, which are critical
to the design and deployment of multimedia systems. After introducing these

we give a shorter alternative proof of this result that does not require G to
be countable, and moreover yields the explicit bound that k is not greater than
1/ab. We also prove with similar methods that if $\{A_i\}$ are finitely many
subsets of G having positive Banach densities $a_i$ and G is countable, then
there exists a subset B whose Banach density is at least the product of the
densities $a_i$ and such that the product $BB^{-1}$ is a subset of the
intersection of the product sets $A_i A_i^{-1}$. In particular, the latter set
is piecewise Bohr.

is normally obtained under statistical non-equilibrium conditions. Here we
propose a new ratchet mechanism where a thermal bath solicits the random
rotation of an asymmetric wheel, which is also subject to Coulomb friction due
to solid-on-solid contacts. Numerical simulations and analytical calculations
demonstrate a net drift induced by friction. If the thermal bath is replaced by
a granular gas, the well known granular ratchet effect also intervenes,
becoming dominant at high collision rates. For our chosen wheel shape the
granular effect acts in the opposite direction with respect to the
friction-induced torque, resulting in the inversion of the ratchet direction as
the collision rate increases. We have realized a new granular ratchet
experiment where both these ratchet effects are observed, as well as the
predicted inversion at their crossover. Our discovery paves the way to the
realization of micro and sub-micrometer Brownian motors in an equilibrium
fluid, based purely upon nano-friction.

individuals. The former disease occurs primarily in South America and Central
America, and the latter disease occurs worldwide. Current therapeutics are
toxic and lack efficacy, and potential vaccines are far from the market.
Increased knowledge about the biology of these parasites is essential for drug
and vaccine development, and new diagnostic tests. In this thesis,
high-throughput sequencing was applied together with extensive bioinformatic
analyses to yield insights into the biology and evolution of Trypanosoma cruzi
and Giardia intestinalis. Bioinformatics analysis of DNA and RNA sequences was
performed to identify features that may be of importance for parasite biology
and functional characterization. This thesis is based on five papers (i-v).
Paper i and ii describe comparative genome studies of three distinct genotypes
of Giardia intestinalis (A, B and E). Paper iii describes a genome comparison
of the human infecting Trypanosoma cruzi with the bat-restricted subspecies
Trypanosoma cruzi marinkellei. Paper iv describes the repertoire of small
non-coding RNAs in Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes. Paper v describes
transcriptome analysis using paired-end RNA-Seq of three distinct genotypes of

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference channels is investigated and
a necessary condition for any Pareto-optimal transmit signal covariance matrix
is presented for the K-pair Gaussian (N,M_1,...,M_K) interference channel. It
is shown that any Pareto-optimal transmit signal covariance matrix at a
transmitter should have its column space contained in the union of the
eigen-spaces of the channel matrices from the transmitter to all receivers.
Based on this necessary condition, an efficient parameterization for the beam
search space is proposed. The proposed parameterization is given by the product
manifold of a Stiefel manifold and a subset of a hyperplane and enables us to
construct a very efficient beam design algorithm by exploiting its rich
geometrical structure and existing tools for optimization on Stiefel manifolds.
Reduction in the beam search space dimension and computational complexity by
the proposed parameterization and the proposed beam design approach is
significant when the number of transmit antennas is larger than the sum of the
numbers of receive antennas, as in upcoming cellular networks adopting massive
MIMO technologies. Numerical results validate the proposed parameterization and
the proposed cooperative beam design method based on the parameterization for
MIMO interference channels.

Stirling's formula to give upper bound for some binomial coefficients.

Friedrich Gauss with the definition of congruence in the `Disquisitiones
Arithmeticae'. Their extraordinary properties provide the basis for a change of
paradigm in arithmetic. By restricting residues to remainders left over by
divison Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet - Gauss's successor in G\""ottingen -
eliminated in his `Lectures on number theory' the fertile concept of residues
and attributed with the number-theoretic approach to residues for more than one
and a half centuries to obscure Gauss's paradigm shift in mathematics from
elementary to higher arithmetic.

extended classical particle is discussed for arbitrary gravitational and
electromagnetic fields. Vector geodesic relations for material space densities
are consequences of tensor gravitational equations for continuous sources and
their fields. Classical four-flows of elementary material space depend on local
four-potentials for charged densities, like in quantum theory. Six
electromagnetic intensities can describe satisfactorily only the simplest,
potential kind of continuous matter motion.
