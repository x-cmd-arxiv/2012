[arXiv:dg-ga/9507004], yields a relationship between the Donaldson and
Seiberg-Witten invariants through a cobordism between the moduli spaces
defining these invariants. The main technical difficulty in this program lies
in describing the links of singularities in this cobordism arising from the
Seiberg-Witten moduli subspaces. In related articles, we defined maps which,
essentially, define normal bundles of strata of these singularities. The link
in question is then the boundary of the union of the tubular neighborhoods
associated with these normal bundles. However, the SO(3)-monopole program
requires the computation of intersection numbers with links where more than one
stratum appears in the family of singularities and thus more than one tubular
neighborhood appears in the definition of the link. Computations of
intersection numbers in unions of open sets have proved difficult for even two
open sets, as early work of Leness [arXiv:dg-ga/9603016] and Ozsvath [1994]
demonstrated. In this note, we give a brief introduction to our monograph
[arXiv:math/0203047], in which we implement these computations.

in calculating $C_{N \pi}$ for a large $N$ in the Wick's theorem, we
constructed a few new algorithms. With these new algorithms, systems with
isospin charge up to 72 are investigated on three anisotropic gauge ensembles

investigated at a fixed low temperature at varying isospin chemical potentials,
$m_{\pi} \le \mu_I \le 4.5 m_{\pi}$. By investigating the behaviour of the
extracted energy density of the system at different isospin chemical

specified in the non-relativistic case (fractal space). We show that, owing to
the scale-dependence which it induces, non-differentiability involves a
fundamental two-valuedness of the mean derivatives. Since, in the scale
relativity framework, the wave function is a manifestation of the velocity
field of fractal space-time geodesics, the two-valuedness of velocities leads
to write them in terms of complex numbers, and yields therefore the complex
nature of the wave function, from which the usual expression of the

Model of Galactic Cosmic Rays according to which the maximum acceleration
energy for Iron nuclei is of the order of $E_{\rm Fe}^{\rm max} \approx 1\times

feature in the all particle spectrum which observationally starts at energy
$E_a \sim (3 - 4)\times 10^{18}$ eV. This model needs a new high energy
galactic component with maximum energy about two orders of magnitude above that
of the Standard Model. The origin of such component is discussed. As
observations are concerned there are two signatures of the transition: change
of energy spectra and mass composition. In all models a heavy galactic
component is changed at the transition to a lighter or proton component.

variants and the continuity between the KS, NW and Pitsch variants are
introduced to represent the crystallographic intricacy associated to the
martensite transformation. From this analysis, a new simple theory based on
Pitsch distortion is proposed. The distortion respects the hard sphere packing
of the iron atoms and implies the existence of a neutral line along the close
packed directions. Its principal strains are 0, -5.8 and +15.5 %, well below
the +12, +12 and -20 % values of the Bain distortion. Martensite variants
nucleate by Pitsch distortion in an austenitic matrix continuously deformed by
the transformation. The martensite variants grow by the same Pitsch distortion;
they are locally in Pitsch orientation, and therefore are gradually oriented
inside the deformation field of austenite leading to the continuum of
orientations including KS and NW. Many observations reported in literature can
now be re-interpreted.

determined by self-gravity balanced by turbulent pressure support and the large
scale galactic shear. While the cloud structures and densities significantly
change during their evolution, they remain roughly in virial equilibrium for
time scales exceeding the free-fall time of GMCs, indicating that energy from
the galactic shear continuously cascades down. We implement star formation at a
slow, inefficient rate of 2% per local free-fall time, but this yields global
star formation rates that are more than ~two orders of magnitude larger than

threshold $R_g$ of plane Couette flow --the flow of a viscous fluid in the

on the Reynolds number R. Even if the existence of a global stability threshold
has been detected in simulations and experiments, its numerical value has not
been unequivocally defined. $R_g$ is the value such that for $R > R_g$
turbulence is sustained, whereas for $R < R_g$ it is transient and eventually
decays. We address the problem of determining $R_g$ by using the extremes -
maxima and minima - of the perturbation energy fluctuations. When $R_g$, both
the positive and negative extremes are bounded. As the critical Reynolds number
is approached from above, the probability of observing a very low minimum
increases causing asymmetries in the distributions of maxima and minima. On the
other hand, the maxima distribution is unaffected as the fluctuations towards
higher values of the perturbation energy remain bounded. This tipping point can
be detected by fitting the data to the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV)
distribution and by identifying $R_g$ as the value of $R$ such that the shape
parameter of the GEV for the minima changes sign from negative to positive. The
results are supported by the analysis of theoretical models which feature a
bistable behavior.

Millimetric observations have measured high degrees of molecular
deuteration in several species seen around low-mass protostars. The Herschel
Space Telescope, launched in 2009, is now providing new measures of the
deuterium fractionation of water, the main constituent of interstellar ices.
Aims. We aim at theoretically studying the formation and the deuteration of
water, which is believed to be formed on interstellar grain surfaces in
molecular clouds. Methods. We used our gas-grain astrochemical model GRAINOBLE,
which considers the multilayer formation of interstellar ices. We varied
several input parameters to study their impact on water deuteration. We
included the treatment of ortho- and para-states of key species, including H2,
which affects the deuterium fractionation of all molecules. The model also
includes relevant laboratory and theoretical works on the water formation and
deuteration on grain surfaces. In particular, we computed the transmission
probabilities of surface reactions using the Eckart model, and we considered
ice photodissociation following molecular dynamics simulations. Results. The
use of a multilayer approach allowed us to study the influence of various
parameters on the abundance and the deuteration of water. Deuteration of water
is found to be very sensitive to the ortho-to-para ratio of H2 and to the total
density, but it also depends on the gas/grain temperatures and the visual
extinction of the cloud. Since the deuteration is very sensitive to the
physical conditions, the comparison with sub-millimetric observation towards
the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293 allows us to suggest that water ice is formed
together with CO2 in molecular clouds with limited density, whilst formaldehyde
and methanol are mainly formed in a later phase, where the condensation becomes
denser and colder.

way to deterministically select a winner in an election among more than two
candidates; the only definite collective preferences are between individual
pairs of candidates. Combinatorially, one may summarize this information with a
graph-theoretic tournament on N vertices (one per candidate), placing an edge
from U to V if U would beat V in an election between only those two candidates
(no ties are permitted). One well-studied procedure for selecting a winner is
to specify a complete binary tree whose leaves are labeled by the candidates,
and evaluate it by running pairwise elections between the pairs of leaves,
sending the winners to successive rounds of pairwise elections which ultimately
terminate with a single winner. This structure is called a voting tree.
  Much research has investigated which functions on tournaments are computable
in this way. Fischer, Procaccia, and Samorodnitsky quantitatively studied the
computability of the Copeland rule, which returns a vertex of maximum
out-degree in the given tournament. Perhaps surprisingly, the best previously
known voting tree could only guarantee a returned out-degree of at least log_2
N, despite the fact that every tournament has a vertex of degree at least
(N-1)/2. In this paper, we present three constructions, the first of which
substantially improves this guarantee to \Theta(sqrt{N}). The other two
demonstrate the richness of the voting tree universe, with a tree that resists
manipulation, and a tree which implements arithmetic modulo three.

transport dynamo model, in which the toroidal field is produced by differential
rotation in the tachocline, the poloidal field is produced by the
Babcock--Leighton mechanism at the solar surface and the meridional circulation
plays a crucial role. Depending on whether the diffusivity is high or low,
either the diffusivity or the meridional circulations provides the main
transport mechanism for the poloidal field to reach the bottom of the
convection zone from the top. We point out that the high-diffusivity flux
transport dynamo model is consistent with various aspects of observational
data. The irregularities of the solar cycle are primarily produced by
fluctuations in the Babcock--Leighton mechanism and in the meridional

photocatalytic sensitivity to visible light due to their deep location in the
ZnO bandgap. X-ray absorption and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy suggest that
Fe is only homogeneously distributed for concentrations up to 3%. Increased
concentrations does not result in a higher concentration of Fe ions in the

galaxies (spirals) in the central region of the galaxy cluster Abell 1367 (z =
0.02) from observations made with the IRAM 30 - m telescope. All 19 spirals
were observed at the position of their optical center and for a subset, at
multiple positions. For each spiral the integrated CO (J = 1 - 0) intensity
from the central pointing, in few cases supplemented with intensities from
offset pointings, was used to estimate its molecular hydrogen mass and H_2
deficiency. Accepting the considerable uncertainties involved in determining
H_2 deficiencies, spirals previously identified by us to have redder colours
and higher HI deficiencies as a result of environmental influence, were found
to be more H_2 deficient compared to members of the sample in less advanced
evolutionary states. For eight of the observed spirals multiple pointing
observations were made to investigate the distribution of their molecular gas.
For these spirals we fitted Gaussians to the CO intensities projected in a line
across the galaxy. In two cases, CGCG 097-079 and CGCG 097-102(N), the offset
between the CO and optical intensity maxima was significantly larger than the
pointing uncertainty and the FWHMs of the fits were significantly greater than
those of the other spirals, irrespective of optical size. Both signatures are
indicators of an abnormal molecular gas distribution. In the case of CGCG
097-079, which is considered an archetype for ram pressure stripping, our
observations indicate the CO intensity maximum lies ~ 15.6 +/- 8.5 arcsec (6
kpc) NW of the optical centre at the same projected position as the HI
intensity maximum.

good expanders. This was first established in the 1980s by Bollob\'as by
directly calculating the probability that a set of vertices has small expansion
and then applying the union bound.
  In this paper we improve on this analysis by relying on a simple high-level
observation: if a graph contains a set of vertices with small expansion then it
must also contain such a set of vertices that is locally optimal, that is, a
set whose expansion cannot be made smaller by exchanging a vertex from the set
with one from the set's complement. We show that the probability that a set of
vertices satisfies this additional property is significantly smaller. Thus,
after again applying the union bound, we obtain improved lower bounds on the
expansion of random $\Delta$-regular graphs for $\Delta\ge 4$. In fact, the
gains from this analysis increase as $\Delta$ grows, a fact we explain by
extending our technique to general $\Delta$. Thus, in the end we obtain an
improvement not only for some small special cases but on the general asymptotic
bound on the expansion of $\Delta$-regular graphs given by Bollob\'as.

dimensionless parameter alpha. There is no detailed model for alpha, so it is
usually taken to be a constant. However, global simulations of
magnetohydrodynamic disks find that alpha varies with distance from the central
object. Also, Newtonian simulations tend to find smaller alpha's than general
relativistic simulations. We seek a one-dimensional model for alpha that can
reproduce these two observations. We are guided by data from six general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic accretion disk simulations. The variation of
alpha in the inner, laminar regions of the flow results from stretching of mean
magnetic field lines by the flow. The variation of alpha in the outer,
turbulent regions results from the dependence of the magnetorotational
instability on the dimensionless shear rate. We give a one-dimensional
prescription for alpha(r) that captures these two effects and reproduces the
radial variation of alpha observed in the simulations. For thin disks, the
prescription simplifies to the formula alpha(r)=0.025[q(r)/1.5]^6, where the
shear parameter, q(r), is an analytical function of radius in the Kerr metric.
The coefficient and exponent are inferred from our simulations and will change
as better simulation data becomes available. We conclude that the
alpha-viscosity prescription can be extended to the radially varying alpha's
observed in simulations. It is possible that Newtonian simulations find smaller
alpha's than general relativistic simulations because the shear parameter is
lower in Newtonian flows.

their experiments with a graphene resonator. The site double-well potential
indicates that the carbon atoms at each lattice point have equal probability to
move upward or downward off-plane. For the considered parameter values, the
relaxation time due to friction is much larger than the periods of membrane
vibrations and the noise is quite small. Then ripples with no preferred

investigation of the neighbours to AGN at redshifts 0.03 < z < 0.2 within a
projected distance of 350 kpc and |\Delta z|<0.001, 0.006, 0.012 and 0.03
between AGN and neighbour.
  1658 Type-1 (broad-line) AGN-galaxy pairs and 5698 Type-2 AGN-galaxy pairs
with spectroscopic redshifts from the Data Release 7 of Sloan Digital Sky
Survey were used together with a complementary set of pairs with photometric
redshifts on the neighbour galaxies (13519 Type-1 AGN-galaxy and 58743 Type-2
AGN-galaxy pairs). Morphologies for the AGN host galaxies were derived from the
Galaxy Zoo project.
  Our results suggest that broad-line AGN and narrow-line AGN reside in widely
different environments where the neighbours to Type-2 AGN are more star-forming
and bluer than those of Type-1 AGN. There is a colour-dependency only
detectable in the neighbours with photometric redshifts for the Type-2 AGN. We
see that the ratio between Type-1/Type-2 neighbours to Type-2 AGN decreases
steadily at short separations with a statistical significance of 4.5 sigma. The
lack of change in the morphology of the Type-2 AGN hosts having a close
companion (contrary to the case of Type-1 AGN hosts) suggests that the innate
state of Type-2 AGN is extremely short-lived and is not preserved in subsequent
mergers. Finally, we perform a hypothetical luminosity test to investigate
whether a mass bias in our selection could explain the observed differences in

supported by the environment of the two types of AGN, but that an evolutionary
connection between them might exist.

In particular, we relate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index of topological insulators

accretion. Contrary to the case without radiation feedback, the accretion rate
increases with increasing BH velocity $\vbh$ reaching a maximum value at
$\vbh=2c_{\rm s,in}\sim 50$ km/s, where $c_{\rm s,in}$ is the sound speed
inside the ""cometary-shaped"" \hii region around the BH, before decreasing as
$\vbh^{-3}$ when the I-front becomes {\it R}-type (rarefied) and the accretion
rate approaches the classical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton solution. The increase of
the accretion rate with $\vbh$ is produced by the formation of a {\it D}-type
(dense) ionization front (I-front) preceded by a standing bow-shock that
reduces the downstream gas velocity to transonic values. There is a range of
densities and velocities where the dense shell is unstable producing periodic
accretion rate peaks which can significantly increase the detectability of
intermediate mass BHs. We find that the mean accretion rate for a moving BH is
larger than that of a stationary BH of the same mass if the medium temperature
is $T_\infty<10^4$ K. This result could be important for the growth of seed BHs

whether the stellar mass or the velocity dispersion is more closely related to
the amplitude of the lensing signal around galaxies - and hence to the
projected distribution of dark matter. The lensing signal on scales smaller
than the virial radius corresponds most closely to the lensing velocity
dispersion in the case of a singular isothermal profile, but is on larger
scales also sensitive to the clustering of the haloes. We select over 4000 lens
galaxies at a redshift z<0.2 with concentrated (or bulge-dominated) surface
brightness profiles from the ~300 square degree overlap between the
Red-sequence Cluster Survey 2 (RCS2) and the data release 7 (DR7) of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We consider both the spectroscopic velocity
dispersion and a model velocity dispersion (a combination of the stellar mass,
the size and the Sersic index of a galaxy). Comparing the model and
spectroscopic velocity dispersion we find that they correlate well for galaxies
with concentrated brightness profiles. We find that the stellar mass and the
spectroscopic velocity dispersion trace the amplitude of the lensing signal on
small scales equally well. The model velocity dispersion, however, does
significantly worse. A possible explanation is that the halo properties that
determine the small-scale lensing signal - mainly the total mass - also depend
on the structural parameters of galaxies, such as the effective radius and
Sersic index, but we lack data for a definitive conclusion.

usually bound to be positive. Under special conditions, however, negative
temperatures - where high-energy states are more occupied than low-energy

localized systems with finite, discrete spectra. Here, we were able to prepare
a negative temperature state for motional degrees of freedom. By tailoring the
Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian we created an attractively interacting ensemble of
ultracold bosons at negative temperature that is stable against collapse for
arbitrary atom numbers. The quasi-momentum distribution develops sharp peaks at
the upper band edge, revealing thermal equilibrium and bosonic coherence over
several lattice sites. Negative temperatures imply negative pressures and open
up new parameter regimes for cold atoms, enabling fundamentally new many-body

between mass ratio and total spin, with chirp mass accurately determined. At
higher masses, the degeneracy persists but is not so clearly characterised by
constant chirp mass as the merger and ringdown become more significant. We

grows to the Chandrasekhar limit, it can undergo an accretion induced collapse
(AIC) to form a rapidly rotating neutron star. Nevertheless, the detection of
such events has so far evaded discovery, likely because the optical,
supernova-like emission is expected to be dim and short-lived. Here we propose
a novel signature of AIC: a transient radio source lasting for a few months.
Rapid rotation along with flux freezing and dynamo action can grow the WD's
magnetic field to magnetar strengths during collapse. The spindown of this
newly born magnetar generates a pulsar wind nebula (PWN) within the
~0.001-0.1Msun of ejecta surrounding it. Our calculations show that synchrotron
emission from the PWN may be detectable in the radio, even if the magnetar has
a rather modest magnetic field of ~2*10^14 G and an initial spin period of ~10
ms. An all-sky survey with a detection limit of 1 mJy at 1.4 GHz would see
~4(f/10^-2) above threshold at any given time, where f is the ratio of the AIC
rate to Type Ia supernova rate. A similar scenario may result from binary
neutron stars if some mergers produce massive neutron stars rather than black
holes. We conclude with a discussion of the detectability of these types of
radio sources in an era of facilities with high mapping speeds.

implications of the radiative feedback from early generations of stars and from
BH accretion for popular models for the formation and growth of seed BHs. We
show that by properly accounting for (1) the limited role of mergers in growing
seed BHs as inferred from cosmological simulations of early star formation and
radiative feedback, (2) the sub-Eddington accretion rates of BHs expected at
the earliest times, and (3) the large radiative efficiencies (e_rad) of the
most massive BHs inferred from observations of active galactic nuclei at high
redshift (e_rad > 0.1), we are led to the conclusion that the initial BH seeds
may have been as massive as > 10^5 M_Sun. This presents a strong challenge to
the Population III seed model, which calls for seed masses of ~ 100 M_Sun and,
even with constant Eddington-limited accretion, requires e_rad < 0.09 to
explain the highest-z SMBHs in today's standard LambdaCDM cosmological model.
It is, however, consistent with the prediction of the direct collapse scenario
of SMBH seed formation, in which a supermassive primordial star forms in a
region of the universe with a high molecule-dissociating background radiation
field, and collapses directly into a 10^4--10^6 M_Sun seed BH. These results
corroborate recent cosmological simulations and observational campaigns which
suggest that these massive BHs were the seeds of a large fraction of the SMBHs
residing in the centers of galaxies today.

derived from a comparison of each star's apparent magnitude with the absolute
magnitude of empirically calibrated color-luminosity fiducials, at the observed

metallicities, magnitudes, and colors into distance uncertainties. We also fold
in ${\it prior}$ information about the giant-branch luminosity function and the
different metallicity distributions of the SEGUE K-giant targeting
sub-categories. We show that the metallicity prior plays a small role in the
distance estimates, but that neglecting the luminosity prior could lead to a
systematic distance modulus bias of up to 0.25 mag, compared to the case of
using the luminosity prior. We find a median distance precision of $16\%$, with
distance estimates most precise for the least metal-poor stars near the tip of
the red-giant branch. The precision and accuracy of our distance estimates are
validated with observations of globular and open clusters. The stars in our

a highly eccentric orbit, which tidal dissipation subsequently shrank and
circularized during close stellar passages. Socrates and collaborators
predicted that the latter class of model should produce a population of

a planetary rather than stellar companion and began tidal circularization much
interior to 1 AU after multiple scatterings. A final alternative is that tidal
circularization occurs much more rapidly early in the tidal circularization

form A$_2$B$_2$O$_7$, where B is a heavy transition metal ion with strong
spin-orbit coupling, in a thin film geometry orientated along the [111]
direction. Along this direction, the pyrochlore lattice consists of alternating
kagome and triangular lattice planes of B ions. We consider a single kagome
layer, a bilayer, and the two different trilayers. As a function of the
strength of the spin-orbit coupling, the direct and indirect $d$-orbital
hopping, and the band filling, we identify a number of scenarios where a
non-interacting time-reversal invariant Z$_2$ topological phase is expected and
we suggest some candidate materials. We study the interactions in the
half-filled $d$-shell within Hatree-Fock theory and identify parameter regimes
where a zero magnetic field Chern insulator with Chern number $\pm1$ can be
found. The most promising geometries for topological phases appear to be the
bilayer which supports both a Z$_2$ topological insulator and a Chern
insulator, and the triangular-kagome-triangular trilayer which supports a
relatively robust Chern insulator phase.

$\beta=0$, the post-Newtonian parameter of the charged black hole evolves to
that of General Relativity via the Vainshtein mechanism within a macroscopic
distance; however, a logarithmic correction to the metric factor of the time
coordinate is obtained. When $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are both nonzero, there exist
two branches of solutions depending on the positivity of $\beta$. When
$\beta<0$, the strong coupling of the scalar graviton weakens gravity at
distances smaller than the Vainshtein radius. However, when $\beta>0$ the
metric factors exhibit only small corrections compared to the solutions
obtained in General Relativity, and under a particular choice of
$\beta=\alpha^2/6$ the standard Reissner-Nordstr\""om-de Sitter solution is

of GJ 581e, respectively. We quantify our sensitivity to shallow transit
signals using Monte Carlo simulations, and perform a transit search within the

orbit ephemerides. Our analysis rules out transits for a planet with an orbital
period of 3.15 days (GJ 581 e) having a radius larger than 1.62 $R_{\oplus}$
(or a density lower than 2.39 g cm$^{-3}$ for an orbital inclination of
90$^{\circ}$) to 2$\sigma$ confidence. Thus, if the planet transits, we can
exclude hydrogen, helium and water theoretical model compositions. The MOST
photometry also allows us to rule out transits of GJ 581b within the Keplerian
orbit-derived transit window for impact parameter values smaller than $\sim$0.4
and confirm previous results which exclude transits for this planet within the
circular orbit-derived transit window, for all plausible interior compositions.

characteristic which is favourable to the development of life in the habitable

period of 5.586 $\pm$ 0.051 days, which is close to the orbital period of GJ
581b ($P=$5.37 days). However, further monitoring of the system is necessary to

modern, massively parallel graphics processors (GPUs). A number of qualities of
the method contribute to this suitability, reaching from locality of reference,
through regularity of access patterns, to high arithmetic intensity. In this

random walk matrix to embed the graph into R^k. The primary use of this
embedding has been for practical spectral clustering algorithms [SM00,NJW02].
Recently, spectral embedding was studied from a theoretical perspective to
prove higher order variants of Cheeger's inequality [LOT12,LRTV12].
  We use spectral embedding to provide a unifying framework for bounding all
the eigenvalues of graphs. For example, we show that for any finite graph with
n vertices and all k >= 2, the k-th largest eigenvalue is at most
1-Omega(k^3/n^3), which extends the only other such result known, which is for
k=2 only and is due to [LO81]. This upper bound improves to 1-Omega(k^2/n^2) if
the graph is regular. We generalize these results, and we provide sharp bounds
on the spectral measure of various classes of graphs, including
vertex-transitive graphs and infinite graphs, in terms of specific graph
parameters like the volume growth.
  As a consequence, using the entire spectrum, we provide (improved) upper
bounds on the return probabilities and mixing time of random walks with
considerably shorter and more direct proofs. Our work introduces spectral
embedding as a new tool in analyzing reversible Markov chains. Furthermore,
building on [Lyo05], we design a local algorithm to approximate the number of
spanning trees of massive graphs.

series at low order yields an efficient scheme for obtaining the approximate
DD. While the zeroth-order theory yields a vanishing DD, the first-order
correction to the DD can be expressed as an explicit universal functional of
the ground-state density and the KS lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
density, allowing the direct evaluation of the DD in the standard KS method
without extra computational cost. The fundamental gap can be predicted by
adding the estimated DD to the KS gap. This scheme is shown to be accurate in
the prediction of the fundamental gaps for a wide variety of atoms and
molecules.

electronic degrees of freedom far away from the Fermi level, called
downfolding, is reexamined. We propose an improved formalism free from the
double-counting of electron correlation in the low-energy degrees of freedom.
In this approach, the exchange-correlation energy in the local density
approximation (LDA) is replaced with the constrained self-energy corrections
defined by the sum of the contribution from eliminated high-energy degrees of
freedom, Sigma H and that from the frequency-dependent part of the partially
screened interaction, Delta Sigma L. We apply the formalism to SrVO3 as well as
to two iron-based superconductors, FeSe and FeTe. The resultant bandwidths of
the effective models are nearly the same as those of the previous downfolding
formalism because of striking cancellations of Sigma H and Delta Sigma L. In
SrVO3, the resultant bandwidth of the effective low-energy model is 2.56 eV (in
comparison to LDA: 2.58 eV, full GW approximation: 2.19 eV). However, in the
non-degenerate multi-band materials such as FeSe and FeTe, the momentum
dependent self-energy effects yield substantial modifications of the band
structures and relative shifts of orbital-energy levels of the effective
models. The FeSe model indicates a substantial downward shift of the x2-y2
orbital level, which may lead to an increase in the filling of the x2-y2
orbital above half filling. It suggests a destruction of the orbital selective
Mott phase of the x2-y2 orbital in agreement with the experimental absence of
the antiferromagnetic phase.

age. Thyroid nodule may presage the emergence of thyroid cancer. The thyroid
nodule can be completely cured if detected early. Fine needle aspiration
cytology is a recognized early diagnosis method of thyroid nodule. There are
still some limitations in the fine needle aspiration cytology, and the
ultrasound diagnosis of thyroid nodule has become the first choice for
auxiliary examination of thyroid nodular disease. If we could combine medical
imaging technology and fine needle aspiration cytology, the diagnostic rate of
thyroid nodule would be improved significantly. The properties of ultrasound
will degrade the image quality, which makes it difficult to recognize the edges
for physicians. Image segmentation technique based on graph theory has become a
research hotspot at present. Normalized cut (Ncut) is a representative one,
which is suitable for segmentation of feature parts of medical image. However,
how to solve the normalized cut has become a problem, which needs large memory
capacity and heavy calculation of weight matrix. It always generates over
segmentation or less segmentation which leads to inaccurate in the
segmentation. The speckle noise in B ultrasound image of thyroid tumor makes
the quality of the image deteriorate. In the light of this characteristic, we
combine the anisotropic diffusion model with the normalized cut in this paper.
After the enhancement of anisotropic diffusion model, it removes the noise in
the B ultrasound image while preserves the important edges and local details.
This reduces the amount of computation in constructing the weight matrix of the
improved normalized cut and improves the accuracy of the final segmentation
results. The feasibility of the method is proved by the experimental results.

`generating function' with the scalar potential. We analyze its stability and
find a later time attractor which describes a Universe approaching to an
eternal-de Sitter inflation driven by the potential energy, $V_0>0$. The
attractor exists when the potential is regular and does not have a linear and
quadratic terms of the field. When the potential has a mass term, the attractor
exists if the scalar field is in a symmetric phase and is weakly coupled,
$\lambda<9V_0/16$. We also find that the attractor property is intact under
small modifications of the potential. If the scalar field has a positive
mass-squared or is strongly coupled, there exists a quasi-attractor. However,
the quasi-attractor property disappears if the potential is modified. On the
whole, the appearance of the eternal inflation is not rare in scalar cosmology
in the presence of an attractor.

Third, over a binary field, we construct an equivalence relation from matrix
null space, and establish an algebra isomorphism from the collection of
equivalence relations to the collection of sets, which any member is a family
of the minimal non-empty sets that are supports of members of null space of a
binary dependence matrix. In a word, matrix provides a new viewpoint to study

Recently Hyperspectral Images (HSI) becomes a high technical tool that the main
goal is to classify the point of a region. The HIS is more than a hundred
bidirectional measures, called bands (or simply images), of the same region
called Ground Truth Map (GT). But some bands are not relevant because they are
affected by different atmospheric effects; others contain redundant
information; and high dimensionality of HSI features make the accuracy of
classification lower. All these bands can be important for some applications;
but for the classification a small subset of these is relevant. The problematic
related to HSI is the dimensionality reduction. Many studies use mutual
information (MI) to select the relevant bands. Others studies use the MI
normalized forms, like Symmetric Uncertainty, in medical imagery applications.
In this paper we introduce an algorithm based also on MI to select relevant
bands and it apply the Symmetric Uncertainty coefficient to control redundancy
and increase the accuracy of classification. This algorithm is feature
selection tool and a Filter strategy. We establish this study on HSI AVIRIS

Regression, Fourier-Transform based
algorithms, Kernel SVM and Kernel ridge regression) operate by reducing the
problem to a convex optimization problem over a vector space of functions.
These methods offer the currently best approach to several central problems
such as learning half spaces and learning DNF's. In addition they are widely
used in numerous application domains. Despite their importance, there are still
very few proof techniques to show limits on the power of these algorithms.
  We study the performance of this approach in the problem of (agnostically and
improperly) learning halfspaces with margin $\gamma$. Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a
distribution over labeled examples. The $\gamma$-margin error of a hyperplane
$h$ is the probability of an example to fall on the wrong side of $h$ or at a
distance $\le\gamma$ from it. The $\gamma$-margin error of the best $h$ is
denoted $\mathrm{Err}_\gamma(\mathcal{D})$. An $\alpha(\gamma)$-approximation
algorithm receives $\gamma,\epsilon$ as input and, using i.i.d. samples of
$\mathcal{D}$, outputs a classifier with error rate $\le
\alpha(\gamma)\mathrm{Err}_\gamma(\mathcal{D}) + \epsilon$. Such an algorithm
is efficient if it uses $\mathrm{poly}(\frac{1}{\gamma},\frac{1}{\epsilon})$
samples and runs in time polynomial in the sample size.
  The best approximation ratio achievable by an efficient algorithm is
$O\left(\frac{1/\gamma}{\sqrt{\log(1/\gamma)}}\right)$ and is achieved using an
algorithm from the above class. Our main result shows that the approximation
ratio of every efficient algorithm from this family must be $\ge
\Omega\left(\frac{1/\gamma}{\mathrm{poly}\left(\log\left(1/\gamma\right)\right)}\right)$,
essentially matching the best known upper bound.
