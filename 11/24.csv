its sphere packing density is an isolated local optimum among periodic point

expansion of gravitational waves for a test particle in circular orbits around
a Schwarzschild black hole to the 22PN order, i.e. $v^{44}$ beyond the leading
Newtonian approximation where $v$ is the orbital velocity of a test particle.
Comparing our 22PN formula for the energy flux with high precision numerical
results, we find that the relative error of the 22PN flux at the innermost
stable circular orbit is about $10^{-5}$. We also estimate the phase difference
between the 22PN waveforms and numerical waveforms after a two-year inspiral.
We find that the dephase is about $10^{-9}$ for $\mu/M=10^{-4}$ and $10^{-2}$
for $\mu/M=10^{-5}$ where $\mu$ is the mass of the compact object and $M$ the
mass of the central supermassive black hole. Finally, we construct a hybrid
formula of the energy flux by supplementing the 4PN formula of the energy flux
for circular and equatorial orbits around a Kerr black hole with all the
present 22PN terms for the case of a Schwarzschild black hole. Comparing the
hybrid formula with the the full numerical results, we examine the performance
of the hybrid formula for the case of Kerr black hole.

against the PPT theory for s orbitals, we obtain the results for p orbitals. We
also show that, as long as the dipole approximation is valid, both the PPT

strong field ionization preferentially removes electrons counter-rotating to
the circularly polarized laser field. The result is illustrated using the

kinetics, producing a growth instability that is largely responsible for the
formation of thin plates and hollow columnar forms. Putting these elements
together, we are able to explain the overall growth behavior of atmospheric ice
crystals over a broad range of conditions. Although our model is complex and
still incomplete, we believe it provides a useful framework for directing
further investigations into the physics underlying snow crystal growth.
Additional targeted experimental investigations should better characterize the
model, or suggest modifications, and we plan to pursue these investigations in
future publications in this series. Our model also suggests new avenues for the
continued exploration of ice surface structure and dynamics using molecular
dynamics simulations.

the generation and detection of the THz radiation has made it a powerful tool
for fundamental research and resulted in a number of applications. However,
some important components necessary to effectively manipulate THz radiation are
still missing. In particular, active polarization and phase control over a
broad THz band would have major applications in science and technology. It
would, e.g., enable high-speed modulation for wireless communications and
real-time chiral structure spectroscopy of proteins and DNA. In physics, this
technology can be also used to precisely measure very weak Faraday and Kerr
effects, as required, for instance, to probe the electrodynamics of topological
insulators. Phase control of THz radiation has been demonstrated using various
approaches. They depend either on the physical dimensions of the phase plate
(and hence provide a fixed phase shift) or on a mechanically controlled time
delay between optical pulses (and hence prevent fast modulation). Here, we
present data that demonstrate the room temperature giant Faraday effect in HgTe
can be electrically tuned over a wide frequency range (0.1-1 THz). The
principle of operation is based on the field effect in a thin HgTe semimetal

Recently, the first flux calibrated NIR library of cool stars from the NASA

fully exploited yet. We want to develop spectroscopic diagnostics for stellar
physical parameters based on features in the wavelength range 1-5 micron. In
this work we test the technique in the I and K bands. The study of the Y, J, H,
and L bands will be presented in the following paper. An objective method for
semi-empirical definition of spectral features sensitive to various physical
parameters is applied to the spectra. It is based on sensitivity map--i.e.,
derivative of the flux in the spectra with respect to the stellar parameters at
a fixed wavelength. New optimized indices are defined and their equivalent
widths (EWs) are measured. A number of sensitive features to the effective
temperature and surface gravity are re-identified or newly identified clearly
showing the reliability of the sensitivity map analysis. The sensitivity map
allows to identify the best bandpass limits for the line and nearby continuum.
It reliably predicts the trends of spectral features with respect to a given
physical parameter but not their absolute strengths. Line blends are easy to
recognize when blended features have different behavior with respect to some
physical stellar parameter. The use of sensitivity map is therefore
complementary to the use of indices. We give the EWs of the new indices
measured for the IRTF star sample. This new and homogeneous set of EWs will be
useful for stellar population synthesis models and can be used to get
element-by-element abundances for unresolved stellar population studies in
galaxies.

in the presence of surface defects. We consider reaction diffusion model in
which atoms undergoes reactions at the defect centers to form clusters. Volume
exclusion between particles is introduced through a drift term in the reaction
diffusion equation that arises due the repulsive force field produced by the
clustering atoms. The volume exclusion terms can be derived from master
equation with a concentration dependent hopping rate. Perturbative analysis is
performed for both cross-exclusion and self-exclusion one dimensional system.
For two dimension numerical analysis is performed. We have found that the
clusterization process slows down due to exclusion. As a result the size of the
clusters reduces. In this model reaction scheme has algebraic nonlinearity and
plausible mechanism is also given.

(MBH), an extreme-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI), is the best way to map space and
time around it. Recent work on stellar dynamics has demonstrated that there
seems to be a complot in phase space acting on low-eccentricity captures, since
their rates decrease significantly by the presence of a blockade in the rate at
which orbital angular momenta change takes place. This so-called ""Schwarzschild
barrier"" is a result of the impact of relativistic precession on to the stellar
potential torques, and thus it affects the enhancement on lower-eccentricity
EMRIs that one would expect from resonant relaxation. We confirm and quantify
the existence of this barrier using a statistical sample of 2,500
direct-summation N-body simulations using both a post-Newtonian and also for
the first time in a direct-summation code a geodesic approximation for the
relativistic orbits. The existence of the barrier prevents low-eccentricity
EMRIs from approaching the central MBH, but high-eccentricity EMRIs, which have
been wrongly classified as ""direct plunges"" until recently, ignore the presence
of the barrier, because they are driven by two-body relaxation. Hence, since
the rates are significantly affected in the case of low-eccentricity EMRIs, we
predict that a LISA-like observatory such as eLISA will predominantly detect
high-eccentricity EMRIs.

in which planets grow in mass at a prescribed rate without orbital migration or
dissipation. We develop an analytic version of this model for two-planet

to the characteristic resonant libration time. In both cases the distribution
of systems in period ratio develops a characteristic asymmetric peak-trough
structure around the resonance, qualitatively similar to that observed in the

SMBHs over the past several hundred Myr. We find that ~50% of the sample have
detectable nuclear X-ray emission. The nuclear X-ray luminosity is correlated
with average accretion rate determined using X-ray cavities, which is
consistent with the hypothesis that nuclear X-ray emission traces ongoing
accretion. The results imply that jets in systems that have experienced recent
AGN outbursts, in the last ~10^7yr, are `on' at least half of the time. Nuclear
X-ray sources become more luminous with respect to the mechanical jet power as
the mean accretion rate rises. We show that nuclear radiation exceeds the jet
power when the mean accretion rate rises above a few percent of the Eddington
rate, where the AGN apparently transitions to a quasar. The nuclear X-ray
emission from three objects (A2052, Hydra A, M84) varies by factors of 2-10 on
timescales of 6 months to 10 years. If variability at this level is a common
phenomenon, it can account for much of the scatter in the relationship between
mean accretion rate and nuclear X-ray luminosity. We find no significant change
in the spectral energy distribution as a function of luminosity in the variable
objects. The relationship between accretion and nuclear X-ray luminosity is
consistent with emission from either a jet, an ADAF, or a combination of the
two, although other origins are possible. We also consider the longstanding
problem of whether jets are powered by the accretion of cold circumnuclear gas
or nearly spherical inflows of hot keV gas.[abridged]

$k_0=0.0160^{+0.0041}_{-0.0035}$ [h/Mpc] (68% confidence) for an effective
redshift of 0.62 and obtain from this the first-ever turnover-derived distance
and cosmology constraints: a measure of the cosmic distance-redshift relation
in units of the horizon scale at the redshift of radiation-matter equality
(r_H) of D_V(z=0.62)/r_H=18.3 (+6.3/-3.3) and, assuming a prior on the number
of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}=3$, constraints on the matter
density parameter $\Omega_Mh^2=0.136^{+0.026}_{-0.052}$ and on the redshift of
matter-radiation equality $z_{eq}=3274^{+631}_{-1260}$. All results are in
excellent agreement with the predictions of standard LCDM models. Our
constraints on the logarithmic slope of the power spectrum on scales larger
than the turnover is bounded in the lower limit with values only as low as -1
allowed, with the prediction of standard LCDM models easily accommodated by our
results. Lastly, we generate forecasts for the achievable precision of future
surveys at constraining $k_0$, $\Omega_Mh^2$, $z_{eq}$ and $N_{eff}$. We find
that BOSS should substantially improve upon the WiggleZ turnover constraint,
reaching a precision on $k_0$ of $\pm$9% (68% confidence), translating to
precisions on $\Omega_Mh^2$ and $z_{eq}$ of $\pm$10% (assuming a prior
$N_{eff}=3$) and on $N_{eff}$ of (+78/-56)% (assuming a prior
$\Omega_Mh^2=0.135$). This is sufficient precision to sharpen the constraints
on $N_{eff}$ from WMAP, particularly in its upper limit. For Euclid, we find
corresponding attainable precisions on $(k_0, \Omega_Mh^2, N_eff)$ of
(3,4,+17/-21)%. This represents a precision approaching our forecasts for the
Planck Surveyor.

consists of 32 BCGs that lie in highly X-ray luminous cluster of galaxies
(L_X-ray (0.1-2.4 keV) > 3*10^44 erg/s) in which AGN-jetted outflows are
creating and sustaining clear Xray cavities. Our sample covers the redshift
range 0 < z < 0.6 and reveals strong evolution in the nuclear X-ray
luminosities, such that the black holes in these systems have become on average
at least 10 times fainter over the last 5 Gyrs. Mindful of potential selection
effects, we propose two possible scenarios to explain our results: 1) either
that the AGNs in BCGs with X-ray cavities are steadily becoming fainter, or
more likely, 2) that the fraction of these BCGs with radiatively efficient
nuclei is decreasing with time from roughly 60 per cent at z=0.6 to 30 per cent
at z=0.1. Based on this strong evolution, we predict that a significant
fraction of BCGs in z=1 clusters may host quasars at their centres, potentially
complicating the search for such clusters at high redshift. In analogy with
black-hole binaries and based on the observed Eddington ratios of our sources,
we further propose that the evolving AGN population in BCGs with X-ray cavities
may be transiting from a canonical low/hard state, analogous to that of X-ray
binaries, to a quiescent state over the last 5 Gyrs.

fraction of satellite galaxies that have been quenched, i.e., are red, is
systematically higher than that of centrals, as seen locally in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The satellite quenching efficiency, which is the
probability that a satellite is quenched because it is a satellite rather than
a central, is, as locally, independent of stellar mass. Furthermore, the
average value is about 0.5, which is also very similar to that seen in the
SDSS. We also construct the mass functions of blue and red centrals and
satellites and show that these broadly follow the predictions of the Peng et
al. analysis of the SDSS groups. Together, these results indicate that the
effect of the group environment in quenching satellite galaxies was very
similar when the universe was about a half its present age, as it is today.

of the Luttinger theorem (LT) for the SU(N) model of Dave, Phillips and Kane
(DPK) is rooted in the non-uniqueness of the ground state (GS) of this model
for 0 < n < N, where n denotes the number of particles in the GS; the validity
of the Luttinger theorem for n = N/2, when N even, is accidental, a consequence
of particle-hole symmetry. Consequently, by supplementing the Hamiltonian of
the SU(N) model with a perturbation Hamiltonian that removes the GS degeneracy,
the LT is to apply also for the SU(N) model in the limit of the coupling
constant, \lambda, of this perturbation approaching zero, where the limit
\lambda --> 0 is clearly to be taken subsequent to taking the zero-temperature
limit of the thermal single-particle Green function in the expression for the
Luttinger number N_L. We explicitly establish the validity of this statement
for the case of N=4. The details of the relevant calculations being distinctly
transparent, one can readily convince oneself that our observation is valid for
arbitrary N. It follows that the issues raised by DPK, such as non-existence of
the Luttinger-Ward functional and ""breakdown of the elemental particle picture
in strongly correlated electron matter"", are all inessential to the observed
failure of the LT. As regards the singularity of the self-energy \Sigma(\omega)
on the real \omega-axis, observed by DPK, we demonstrate that this also is a
direct consequence of the non-uniqueness of the GS of the SU(N) model for 0 < n
< N. In the light of the above observations, we are in a position to state that
to this date no case has come to light indicative of the failure of the LT
under the conditions for which it has been deduced. [Abridged Abstract]

The security level is increased by randomly distributing the text message over
the entire image instead of clustering within specific image portions. Storage
capacity is increased by utilizing all the color channels for storing
information and providing the source text message compression. The degradation
of the images can be minimized by changing only one least significant bit per
color channel for hiding the message, incurring a very little change in the
original image. Using steganography alone with simple LSB has a potential
problem that the secret message is easily detectable from the histogram
analysis method. To improve the security as well as the image embedding
capacity indirectly, a compression based scheme is introduced. Various tests
have been done to check the storage capacity and message distribution. These
testes show the superiority of the proposed approach with respect to other
existing approaches.

functional units responsible for driving key biological mechanisms within the
cell. Their identification is therefore necessary not only to understand
complex formation but also the higher level organization of the cell. With the
advent of high-throughput techniques in molecular biology, significant amount
of physical interaction data has been cataloged from organisms such as yeast,
which has in turn fueled computational approaches to systematically mine
complexes from the network of physical interactions among proteins (PPI
network). In this survey, we review, classify and evaluate some of the key
computational methods developed till date for the identification of protein
complexes from PPI networks. We present two insightful taxonomies that reflect
how these methods have evolved over the years towards improving automated
complex prediction. We also discuss some open challenges facing accurate
reconstruction of complexes, the crucial ones being presence of high proportion
of errors and noise in current high-throughput datasets and some key aspects
overlooked by current complex detection methods. We hope this review will not
only help to condense the history of computational complex detection for easy
reference, but also provide valuable insights to drive further research in this
area.

version of the common inductively coupled plasma sources, has a number of well
known advantages such as high efficiency, high level of ionization, low minimal
gas pressure, very low required driver frequency, and even a possibility to be
driven by single current pulses. We present an experimental study of such an
FICP source which showed that above a certain value of the driving pulse power
the properties of this device changed rather drastically. Namely, the plasma
became non-stationary and non-uniform contrary to the stationary and uniform
plasmas typical for this kind of plasma sources. In this case the plasma
appeared as a narrow dense spike which was short compared to the driving pulse.
The local plasma density could exceed the neutral atoms density by a few orders
of magnitude. When that happened, the afterglow plasma decay time after the end
of the pulse was long compared to an ordinary case with no plasma spike.
Experiments were performed with various gases and in a wide range of pressures
which enabled us to understand the physical mechanism and derive the parameters
responsible for such plasma behavior. A qualitative model of this phenomenon is
discussed.

interaction between a system and a detecting apparatus, the average output of
the latter could be much larger than the maximum eigenvalue of the observed
quantity (times the amplification factor). This does not always happen,
however: the observed system must subsequently undergo a second measurement, on
the output of which the result of the first one is conditioned. This procedure
is known as postselection. On the other hand, linear response theory describes
how the observables of a quan- tum system change upon perturbation by a weak
classical external force. In a measurement, the measured system applies a
generalized force to the measuring apparatus, leading to an observable change
in the latter. It appears natural, then, to unify the treatment of weak
measurements with an extended version of linear response theory that accounts
for a force introduced by an external quantum system. Here, we show how the
postselection introduces a complex force term and we provide a modified Kubo
formula working in the non-linear regime.

an AND-NOT network with similar dynamical properties. There is a one-to-one
correspondence between AND-NOT networks, their wiring diagrams, and their

importance of the tensor force. The tensor force plays a role in the
$N$-dependence of $\mathit{\Delta}\varepsilon_{13}$ also in neutron-rich Ca
nuclei. While the $p1s_{1/2}$-$p0d_{3/2}$ inversion is predicted in heavier Ca
nuclei as in $^{48}$Ca, it takes place only in $N\geq 46$, delayed by the
tensor force. We further investigate possibility of proton bubble structure in
Ar, which is suggested by the $p1s_{1/2}$-$p0d_{3/2}$ inversion in $^{48}$Ca
and more neutron-rich Ca nuclei, by the spherical Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov

prohibits prominent bubble distribution in $^{46}$Ar. Bubble in Ar is unlikely
also near neutron drip line because either of unboundness or of deformation.
However, $^{34}$Si remains a candidate for proton bubble structure, owing to
large shell gap between $p1s_{1/2}$ and $p0d_{5/2}$.

independent resistance, this approach can significantly linearise the response
of the detector in the large signal limit. The electrothermal feedback is
enhanced in comparison with the commonly applied voltage biasing, which further
increases the speed of the detector. Furthermore, in frequency domain
multiplexed (FDM) readout, the sinusoidal bias voltages for each TES can be
generated cryogenically with the readout SQUIDs.

study approach was used. Ten doctors were purposively selected from ten
hospitals in the North West Province. Data was collected using semi-structured
open ended interview questions. The interviewees were asked to tell in their
own words the average number of patients served per week, processes used in
consultation with other doctors, communication practices using
computer-mediated tool, transmission speed of the computer-mediated tool and
satisfaction in using the computer-mediated communication tool. The findings
revealed that an average of 15 consultations per doctor to a specialist doctor
per week was done through face to face or through telephone conversation
instead of using a computer-mediated tool. Participants cited reasons for not
using computer-mediated tool for communication due to slow transmission speed
of the Internet and regular down turn of the Internet connectivity, constant
electricity power outages and lack of e-health application software to support
real time computer-mediated communication. The results led to the
recommendation of a hybrid cloud computing architecture for improving

of the observation subset \omega among all possible subsets of a given measure

specific choice of the initial data is given and therefore we deal with a
particular solution, we show that the problem always admits at least one
solution that can be regular or of fractal type depending on the regularity of
the initial data. We then introduce a relevant criterion, not depending on the
initial conditions and to choose the observation set in an uniform way,
independent of the data and solutions under consideration. Through spectral
decompositions, this leads to a second problem which consists of maximizing a
spectral functional that can be viewed as a measure of eigenfunction
concentration. This spectral criterion can be interpreted in two ways: it
corresponds either to a time asymptotic observability constant as the
observation time interval tends to infinity, or to a randomized version of the
deterministic observability inequality. Under appropriate quantum ergodicity
assumptions on $\Omega$, we compute the optimal value. We then provide spectral
approximations and present some numerical simulations that fully confirm the
theoretical results in the paper and support our conjectures. Our results
highlight precise connections between optimal observability issues and quantum

with a number of simple transitivity equations relating couples of initial and

section. Before the collision the state is a product of two normalized
Gaussians. We take the purity as the measure of the entanglement after the
scattering. We give a rigorous computation, with error bound, of the leading
order of the purity at low-energy. For a large class of potentials, that are
not assumed to be spherically symmetric, we prove that the low-energy behaviour
of the purity, $\mathcal P$, is universal. It is given by $\mathcal P= 1-
\frac{1}{(\ln (\sigma/\hbar))^2} \mathcal E$, where $\sigma$ is the variance of
the Gaussians and the entanglement coefficient, $\mathcal E$, depends only on
the masses of the particles and not on the interaction potential. The
entanglement depends strongly in the difference of the masses. It takes its
minimum when the masses are equal, and it increases rapidly with the difference

both the magnetic Bertotti-Robinson (BR) and Melvin (ML) solutions as a single
metric in the axially symmetric coordinates ${t,\rho,z,\varphi} $. Depending on
the strength of magnetic field the spacetime manifold, unlike the cases of
separate BR and ML spacetime, develops singularity on the symmetry axis ($\rho
=0$). Our analysis shows, beside other things that there are regions
inaccessible to all null geodesics.

law. We develop a recursive relation between the probabilities, using simple
intuitive ideas. We first use numerical solutions of this recursion and verify
that the solutions converge to the benford's law. Finally we solve the
recursion analytically to yeild the benford's law for base 2.

Modified teleparallel gravity theory with the torsion scalar has recently
gained a lot of attention as a possible explanation of dark energy. We perform
a thorough reconstruction analysis on the so-called $F(T)$ models, where $F(T)$
is some general function of the torsion term, and deduce the required
conditions for the equivalence between of $F(T)$ models with pure kinetic
k-essence models. We present a new class of models of $F(T)$-gravity and
k-essence.

hole entropy assumes a crucial role. However, the entropy-area relation can be
modified including some quantum effects, motivated from the Loop Quantum
Gravity (LQG), string theory and black hole physics. In this paper, we study
the cosmological implications of the interacting logarithmic entropy-corrected
HDE (LECHDE) model in the framework of Brans-Dicke (BD) cosmology. As system's
infrared (IR) cut-off, we choose the average radius of Ricci scalar curvature,
i.e. $R^{-1/2}$. We obtain the Equation of State (EoS) parameter $\omega_D$,
the deceleration parameter $q$ and the evolution of energy density parameter
$\Omega'_D$ of our model in a non-flat universe. Moreover, we study the
limiting cases corresponding to our model without corrections and to the
Einstein's gravity.
