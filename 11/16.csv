RHIC have produced a treasure trove of results which indicate that the medium
produced in Au+Au collisions is a strongly interacting quark gluon liquid in
which both light and heavy quarks are suppressed, presumably by energy loss in
the hot, dense medium. These results have been confirmed in Pb+Pb collisions at
the LHC along with the addition of measurements of jets and di-jets. Results
and methods at RHIC and LHC are compared which leads to some interesting
conclusions.

frequency spectra as multiplet structures around the harmonics of the
pulsation. The positive value of the asymmetry parameter (Q=+0.51) of the

however, are difficult to implement in a satisfying way with existing grammar

nearly-free-electron metal with the bcc structure. Chlorine is a molecular
crystal, consisting of Cl2 molecules. Sodium chloride, due to the large
electronegativity difference between Na and Cl atoms, has highly ionic chemical
bonding, with stoichiometry 1:1 dictated by charge balance, and rocksalt
(B1-type) crystal structure in accordance with Pauling's rules. Up to now,
Na-Cl was thought to be an ultimately simple textbook system. Here, we show
that under pressure the stability of compounds in the Na-Cl system changes and
new materials with different stoichiometries emerge at pressure as low as 25
GPa. In addition to NaCl, our theoretical calculations predict the stability of
Na3Cl, Na2Cl, Na3Cl2, NaCl3 and NaCl7 compounds with unusual bonding and
electronic properties. The bandgap is closed for the majority of these
materials. Guided by these predictions, we have synthesized cubic NaCl3 at
55-60 GPa in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell at temperatures above 2000 K.

measurements in both cases. The influence of fragmentation reactions on the
TEPC response to a narrow pencil-like beam with its width smaller than the TEPC
diameter is investigated by Monte Carlo modeling. It is found that total lineal
energy spectra are not very sensitive to the choice of the nuclear

differs from the data on the axis of a therapeutic beam by less than 10% and by
10-20% at other TEPC positions. The validation of MCHIT with neutron beams
gives us confidence in estimating the contributions to lineal energy spectra
due to secondary neutrons produced in water by C-12 nuclei. As found, the
neutron contribution at 10 cm distance from the beam axis amounts to ~ 50%

Lombardo, T. Nunes da Silva and E. Pallante,""The bulk transition of QCD with
twelve flavors and the role of improvement""] for the SU(3) gauge theory with
Nf=12 fundamental flavors, and we add some numerical evidence and theoretical
discussion. In particular, we study the nature of the bulk transition that
separates a chirally broken phase at strong coupling from a chirally restored
phase at weak coupling. When a non-improved action is used, a rapid crossover
is observed at small bare quark masses. Our results confirm a first order
nature for this transition, in agreement with previous results we obtained
using an improved action. As shown in Ref.[1], when improvement of the action
is used, the transition is preceded by a second rapid crossover at weaker
coupling and an exotic phase emerges, where chiral symmetry is not yet broken.
This can be explained [1] by the non hermiticity of the improved lattice
Transfer matrix, arising from the competition of nearest-neighbor and
non-nearest neighbor interactions, the latter introduced by improvement and
becoming increasingly relevant at strong coupling and coarse lattices. We
further comment on how improvement may generally affect any lattice system at
strong coupling, be it graphene or non abelian gauge theories inside or
slightly below the conformal window.

an elliptically polarized field is presented using time-dependent effective
range (TDER) theory to treat both electron-laser and electron-atom interactions
non-perturbatively. Closed-form formulas describing plateau features in LAES
spectra are derived quantum mechanically in the low-frequency limit. These
formulas provide an analytic explanation for key features of the LAES
differential cross section. For the low-energy region of the LAES spectrum, our
result generalizes the Kroll-Watson formula to the case of elliptic
polarization. For the high-energy (rescattering) plateau in the LAES spectrum,
our result generalizes prior results for a linearly polarized field valid for
the high-energy end of the rescattering plateau [A.\,V. Flegel \textit{et al.},
J. Phys. B \textbf{42}, 241002 (2009)] and confirms the factorization of the
LAES cross section into three factors: two field-free elastic electron-atom
scattering cross sections (with laser-modified momenta) and a laser
field-dependent factor (insensitive to the scattering potential) describing the
laser-driven motion of the electron in the elliptically polarized field. We
present also approximate analytic expressions for the exact TDER LAES amplitude
that are valid over the entire rescattering plateau and reduce to the
three-factor form in the plateau cutoff region. The theory is illustrated for
the cases of $e$-H scattering in a CO$_2$-laser field and $e$-F scattering in a
mid-infrared laser field of wavelength $\lambda=3.5\,\mu$m, for which the
analytic results are shown to be in good agreement with exact numerical TDER
results.

Galaxy, named MACS0647-JD, was discovered as part of the Cluster Lensing and
Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We observe three magnified images of this
galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster
MACSJ0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. The images are magnified by factors of ~8, 7,
and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude AB (~0.15 uJy) in the
WFC3/IR F160W filter (~1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at >~ 12-sigma.
All three images are also confidently detected at >~ 6-sigma in F140W (~1.2 -
1.6 um), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength HST filters (~0.2 -
1.4 um), and lacking bright detections in Spitzer/IRAC 3.6um and 4.5um imaging
(~3.2 - 5.0 um). We rule out a broad range of possible lower redshift
interlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.
Our high redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected a
Bayesian photometric redshift prior. Given CLASH observations of 17 high mass
clusters to date, our discoveries of MACS0647-JD at z ~ 10.8 and MACS1149-JD1
at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated from
lower redshifts. This would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could have
reionized the universe. However given the significant uncertainties based on

step resolution at the close encounter, we propose to choose the time step
based on the magnitude of the space charge forces. Inspired by geometric
integration techniques, our algorithm chooses the time step proportional to a
function of the current phase space state instead of calculating a local error
estimate like a conventional adaptive procedure. In this paper we build up on
first observations made in recent work. A more profound argument is given on
how exactly the time step should be chosen. An intermediate algorithm,
initially built to allow a clearer analysis by introducing separate time steps
for external field and self field integration, turned out to be useful in
itself already for a large class of problems.

the ability of the caustic technique to identify the cluster galaxy members. We
identify the true three-dimensional members as the gravitationally bound
galaxies. The caustic technique uses the caustic location in the redshift
diagram to separate the cluster members from the interlopers. We apply the
technique to mock catalogues containing 1000 galaxies in the field of view of
12 Mpc/h on a side at the cluster location. On average, this sample size
roughly corresponds to 180 real galaxy members within 3r200, similar to recent
redshift surveys of cluster regions. The caustic technique yields a
completeness, the fraction of identified true members, fc=0.95 (+- 0.03) within
3r200. The contamination increases from fi=0.020 (+0.046;-0.015) at r200 to
fi=0.08 (+0.11;-0.05) at 3r200. No other technique for the identification of
the members of a galaxy cluster provides such large completeness and small
contamination at these large radii. The caustic technique assumes spherical
symmetry and the asphericity of the cluster is responsible for most of the
spread of the completeness and the contamination. By applying the technique to
an approximately spherical system obtained by stacking the individual clusters,
the spreads decrease by at least a factor of two. We finally estimate the
cluster mass within 3r200 after removing the interlopers: for individual
clusters, the mass estimated with the virial theorem is unbiased and within 30
per cent of the actual mass; this spread decreases to less than 10 per cent for

response theories of fermionic BCS superfluids. The linear theory of a
noninteracting Fermi gas is reviewed and several consistency constraints are
verified. The challenge to formulate linear response theories of BCS
superfluids consistent with density and spin conservation laws comes from the
presence of a broken U(1)$_{\textrm{EM}}$ symmetry associated with
electromagnetism (EM) and we discuss two routes for circumventing this. The
first route follows Nambu's integral-equation approach for the EM vertex
function, but this method is not specific for BCS superfluids. We focus on the
second route based on a consistent-fluctuation-of-the order-parameter (CFOP)
approach where the gauge transformation and the fluctuations of the order
parameter are treated on equal footing. The CFOP approach allows one to
explicitly verify several important constraints: The EM vertex satisfies not
only a Ward identity which guarantees charge conservation but also a $Q$-limit
Ward identity associated with the compressibility sum rule. In contrast, the
spin degrees of freedom associated with another U(1)$_z$ symmetry are not
affected by the Cooper-pair condensation that breaks only the
U(1)$_{\textrm{EM}}$ symmetry. As a consequence the collective modes from the
fluctuations of the order parameter only couple to the density response
function but decouple from the spin response function, which reflects the
different fates of the two U(1) symmetries in the superfluid phase. Our
formulation lays the ground work for application to more general theories of
BCS-Bose Einstein Condensation crossover both above and below $T_c$.

multiple users who must compete to gain access to it. The operation of the
network by self-interested and strategic users usually leads to the overuse of
the channel resources and to substantial inefficiencies. Hence, incentive
schemes are needed to overcome the inefficiencies of non-cooperative
equilibrium. In this work we consider a slotted-Aloha like random access
protocol and two incentive schemes: pricing and intervention. We provide some
criteria for the designer of the protocol to choose one scheme between them and
to design the best policy for the selected scheme, depending on the system
parameters. Our results show that intervention can achieve the maximum
efficiency in the perfect monitoring scenario. In the imperfect monitoring
scenario, instead, the performance of the system depends on the information
held by the different entities and, in some cases, there exists a threshold for
the number of users such that, for a number of users lower than the threshold,
intervention outperforms pricing, whereas, for a number of users higher than
the threshold pricing outperforms intervention.

{\it circle maps} (Garabedian-Schiffer's translation of ""Kreisabbildung""), i.e.
those (branched) maps effecting the conformal representation upon the disc of a
{\it compact bordered Riemann surface}. The theory in question has some
well-known intersection with real algebraic geometry, especially Klein's
ortho-symmetric curves via the paradigm of {\it total reality}. This leads to a
gallery of pictures quite pleasant to visit of which we have attempted to trace
the simplest representatives. This drifted us toward some electrodynamic
motions along real circuits of dividing curves perhaps reminiscent of Kepler's
planetary motions along ellipses. The ultimate origin of circle maps is of
course to be traced back to Riemann's Thesis 1851 as well as his 1857 Nachlass.
Apart from an abrupt claim by Teichm\""uller 1941 that everything is to be found
in Klein (what we failed to assess on printed evidence), the pivotal
contribution belongs to Ahlfors 1950 supplying an existence-proof of circle
maps, as well as an analysis of an allied function-theoretic extremal problem.
Works by Yamada 1978--2001, Gouma 1998 and Coppens 2011 suggest sharper degree
controls than available in Ahlfors' era. Accordingly, our partisan belief is
that much remains to be clarified regarding the foundation and optimal control
of Ahlfors circle maps. The game of sharp estimation may look narrow-minded
""Absch\""atzungsmathematik"" alike, yet the philosophical outcome is as usual to
contemplate how conformal and algebraic geometry are fighting together for the
soul of Riemann surfaces. A second part explores the connection with Hilbert's
16th as envisioned by Rohlin 1978.

of the present study deals with the epistula as a literary work (genre,
language, sources), dealing in turn with vocabulary, morphology and syntax,
rythmical prose and rhetorical figures, literary and Biblical references. If we
compare it with D\'ungal's other works, the letter is cast in the canonical
oratio structure similar to his later Responsa contra Claudium (ed. Zanna,

Macrobius' commentary In Somnium Scipionis. A possible echo of Vitruvius'
astronomical presentation in book IX of his De architectura is suggested.
Finally, we attempt to define how the author's persona as famulus et orator and
reclusus at St-Denis relates to Charlemagne and to abbot Waldo in his pursuit
of Chirstian wisdom based on the Bible rahter than of scholarship per se based
on academic research. Part II is a thorough technical discussion of the
astronomical issue presented to the Irish scholar by the Emperor, i.e. The
frequency of solar eclipses and their visibility in the two emispheres in the
year 810 (see maps provided). It assesses D\'ungal's case in terms of eclipse
theory and reviews previous comments on his letter to Charlemagne by astronomer
Ismael Bullialdus (1605-1694). It also introduces us to first-hand knowledge of
eclipses in history and nowadays, providing a glimpse into the complex problems
tackled by the Irishman and his sources in Late Antique and in the Early Middle
Ages. Ample footnotes to the Italian translation of D\'ungal's work are an
essential guiding tool for Latinists unfamiliar with astronomy.

classical and powerful tools in the analysis of problems ruled by 2nd order

understand Schauder type estimates fashioning particular borderline scenarios.
In such context, it has been a common accepted aphorism that the continuity of
the Hessian of a solution could never be superior than the continuity of the
medium. Notwithstanding, in this article we show that solutions to uniformly
elliptic, linear equations with $C^{0,\bar{\epsilon}}$ coefficients are of
class $C^{2,\alpha}$, for any $0 < \bar{\epsilon} \ll \alpha < 1$, at Hessian
degenerate points, $\mathscr{H}(u):=\{X \suchthat D^2u(X) = 0\}$. In fact we
develop a more general regularity result at such Hessian degenerate points,
featuring into the theory of fully nonlinear equations. Insofar as the optimal
modulus of continuity for the Hessian is concerned, the result of this paper is
the first one in the literature to surpass the inborn obstruction from the

consistent with results from the recent CMS p+Pb run at $\sqrt{s}_{\rm NN} =
5.02$ TeV for the largest track multiplicity $N_{\rm track}\sim 40$ we
considered. The CMS p+Pb data shows the following striking features: i) a
strong dependence of the ridge yield on $N_{\rm track}$, with a significantly
larger signal than in p+p for the same $N_{\rm track}$, ii) a stronger $p_T$
dependence than in p+p for large $N_{\rm track}$, and iii) a nearside
collimation for large $N_{\rm track}$ comparable to the awayside for the lower
$p_T = p_{T}^{\rm trig.}=p_{T}^{\rm assoc.}$ di-hadron windows. We show here
that these systematic features of the CMS p+Pb di-hadron data are all described
by the CGC (with parameters fixed by the p+p data) when we extend our
prediction in arXiv:1210.3890 to rarer high multiplicity events. We also
predict the azimuthally collimated yield for yet unpublished windows in the
$p_{T}^{\rm trig.}$ and $p_{T}^{\rm assoc.}$ matrix.

structure. Electrical resistivity rho data from TN to 350 K are fitted by the
Bloch-Gruneisen model for electron-phonon scattering, yielding a Debye
temperature of 265(2) K. A strong decrease in rho occurs below TN due to loss
of spin-disorder scattering. Heat capacity data at 25 K < T < 300 K are fitted

important for both evolutionary prediction and artificial selection. For
example, changes in gene expression can provide insight into developmental and
physiological mechanisms that link genotype and phenotype. However, classical
analytical techniques are poorly suited to quantitative genetic studies of gene
expression where the number of traits assayed per individual can reach many
thousand. Here, we derive a Bayesian genetic sparse factor model for estimating
the genetic covariance matrix (G-matrix) of high-dimensional traits, such as
gene expression, in a mixed effects model. The key idea of our model is that we
need only consider G-matrices that are biologically plausible. An organism's
entire phenotype is the result of processes that are modular and have limited
complexity. This implies that the G-matrix will be highly structured. In
particular, we assume that a limited number of intermediate traits (or factors,
e.g., variations in development or physiology) control the variation in the
high-dimensional phenotype, and that each of these intermediate traits is
sparse -- affecting only a few observed traits. The advantages of this approach
are two-fold. First, sparse factors are interpretable and provide biological
insight into mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture. Second, enforcing
sparsity helps prevent sampling errors from swamping out the true signal in
high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the advantages of our model on simulated
data and in an analysis of a published Drosophila melanogaster gene expression
data set.

networks. Specifically, we propose a novel framework based on level-triggered
sampling, a non-uniform sampling strategy, and sequential estimation. The
proposed estimator can be used as an asymptotically optimal fixed-sample-size
decentralized estimator under non-fading listening channels (through which
sensors collect their observations), as an alternative to the one-shot
estimators commonly found in the literature. It can also be used as an
asymptotically optimal sequential decentralized estimator under fading
listening channels. We show that the optimal centralized estimator under
Gaussian noise is characterized by two processes, namely the observed Fisher
information U_t, and the observed correlation V_t. It is noted that under
non-fading listening channels only V_t is random, whereas under fading
listening channels both U_t and V_t are random. In the proposed scheme, each
sensor computes its local random process(es), and sends a single bit to the
fusion center (FC) whenever the local random process(es) pass(es) certain
predefined levels. The FC, upon receiving a bit from a sensor, updates its
approximation to the corresponding global random process, and accordingly its
estimate. The sequential estimation process terminates when the observed Fisher
information (or the approximation to it) reaches a target value. We provide an
asymptotic analysis for the proposed estimator and also the one based on
conventional uniform-in-time sampling under both non-fading and fading
channels; and determine the conditions under which they are asymptotically
optimal, consistent, and asymptotically unbiased. Analytical results, together
with simulation results, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed estimator
based on level-triggered sampling over the traditional decentralized estimator

and binary orbits. In this paper, we explore how the mutual inclination between
the planetary and binary orbits may reflect the physical conditions of the
assembly of protoplanetary disks and the interaction between protostellar
binaries and circumbinary disks. Given the turbulent nature of star-forming
molecular clouds, it is possible that the gas falling onto the outer region of
a circumbinary disk and the central protostellar binary have different axes of
rotation. Thus, the newly assembled circumbinary disk can be misaligned with
respect to the binary. However, the gravitational torque from the binary
produces a warp and twist in the disk, and the back-reaction torque tends to
align the disk and the binary orbital plane. We present a new, analytic
calculation of this alignment torque, and show that the binary-disk inclination
angle can be reduced appreciably after the binary accretes a few percent of its
mass from the disk. Our calculation suggests that in the absence of other
disturbances, circumbinary disks and planets around close (sub-AU) stellar
binaries, for which mass accretion onto the proto-binary is very likely to have
occurred, are expected to be highly aligned with the binary orbits, while disks
and planets around wide binaries can be misaligned. Measurements of the mutual
inclinations of circumbinary planetary systems can provide a clue to the birth
environments of such systems.

E/E\approx 2\times 10^{-6}$. This is much better than for most modern x-ray
spectrometers. Such resolution allows one to resolve the fine spectral
structure of the XFEL pulse. The effect of diffraction focusing occurs in a
single crystal plate due to dynamical scattering, and is similar to focusing in
a Pendry lens made from the metamaterial with a negative refraction index. Such
a spectrometer is easier to operate than those based on bent crystals. We show

acceleration of ions at shocks, and the acceleration of electrons at shocks.
Chapter 2 studies the propagation of solar energetic particles(SEPs) in
turbulent magnetic fields. Particle trajectories in turbulent magnetic fields
are numerically integrated. The turbulence includes a Kolmogorov-like power
spectrum containing a broad range of scales. Small-scale variations in particle
intensities(dropouts) and velocity dispersions can be reproduced. The result
gives a constraint on the error of onset analysis for inferring SEP
informations. We find that dropouts are rarely produced using the two-component
model(Matthaeus et al., 1990). The result questions the turbulence model.
Chapter 3 studies the acceleration of ions. We use 3-D hybrid simulations to
study the acceleration of low-energy particles at parallel shocks. We find that
particles gain energy by reflection at the shock. The protons can move off
field lines in 3-D electric and magnetic fields. We also use a stochastic
integration method to study diffusive shock acceleration including large-scale
magnetic variations. The results can explain the observations of anomalous
cosmic rays by Voyager 1. Chapter 4 studies electron acceleration at a shock in
a turbulent magnetic field by combining hybrid simulations and test-particle
simulations. The acceleration is enhanced by including large-scale turbulence.
Since electrons mainly follow field lines, the field-line braiding allows
electrons interacting with shock many times. Ripples also contribute to
acceleration by mirroring electrons. The process favors perpendicular shocks.
We discuss the implication to SEPs by comparing the acceleration of electrons
with that of protons. The intensity correlation of electrons and ions in SEPs
implies perpendicular shocks play important roles in accelerating particles.

  Matches version accepted by JHEP",,"10.1007/JHEP05(2013)022",,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current Higgs data show an ambiguity in the value of the Yukawa couplings to
quarks and leptons. Not so much because of still large uncertainties in the
measurements but as the result of several almost degenerate minima in the
coupling profile likelihood function. To break these degeneracies, it is
important to identify and measure processes where the Higgs coupling to
fermions interferes with other coupling(s). The most prominent example, the
decay of $h \to \gamma \gamma$, is not sufficient to give a definitive answer.
In this Letter, we argue that $t$-channel single top production in association
with a Higgs boson, with $h\to b\bar b$, can provide the necessary information
to lift the remaining degeneracy in the top Yukawa. Within the Standard Model,
the total rate is highly reduced due to an almost perfect destructive
interference in the hard process, $W b \rightarrow t h$. We first show that for
non-standard couplings the cross section can be reliably computed without
worrying about corrections from physics beyond the cutoff scale $\Lambda\gtrsim
10\,\mathrm{TeV}$, and that it can be enhanced by more than one order of
magnitude compared to the SM. We then study the signal $ p p \rightarrow t h j
(b)$ with 3 and 4 $b$'s in the final state, and its main backgrounds at the
LHC. We find the 8 TeV run dataset to be sensitive to the sign of the anomalous
top Yukawa coupling, while already a moderate integrated luminosity at 14 TeV
should lift the degeneracy completely.

especially at low metallicity, with consequences for their chemical yields,
ionizing flux and final fate. Determining the natal rotation-rate distribution
of stars is of high priority given its importance as a constraint on theories
of massive star formation and as input for models of stellar populations in the
local Universe and at high redshift. Recently, it has become clear that the
majority of massive stars interact with a binary companion before they die. We
investigate how this affects the distribution of rotation rates.
  For this purpose, we simulate a massive binary-star population typical for
our Galaxy assuming continuous star formation. We find that, because of binary
interaction, 20^+5_-10% of all massive main-sequence stars have projected
rotational velocities in excess of 200km/s. We evaluate the effect of uncertain
input distributions and physical processes and conclude that the main
uncertainties are the mass transfer efficiency and the possible effect of
magnetic braking, especially if magnetic fields are generated or amplified
during mass accretion and stellar mergers.
  The fraction of rapid rotators we derive is similar to that observed. If
indeed mass transfer and mergers are the main cause for rapid rotation in
massive stars, little room remains for rapidly rotating stars that are born
single. This implies that spin down during star formation is even more
efficient than previously thought. In addition, this raises questions about the
interpretation of the surface abundances of rapidly rotating stars as evidence
for rotational mixing. Furthermore, our results allow for the possibility that
all early-type Be stars result from binary interactions and suggest that
evidence for rotation in explosions, such as long gamma-ray bursts, points to a
binary origin.

has generated much experimental interest, for it is potentially a direct probe
of the Epoch of Reionization and the Dark Ages. Since the cosmological signal
here has a purely spectral signature, most proposed experiments have little
angular sensitivity. This is worrisome because with only spectra, the global
21cm signal can be difficult to distinguish from foregrounds such as Galactic
synchrotron radiation, as both are spectrally smooth and the latter is orders
of magnitude brighter. We establish a mathematical framework for global signal
data analysis in a way that removes foregrounds optimally, complementing
spectra with angular information. We explore various experimental design
trade-offs, and find that 1) with spectral-only methods, it is impossible to
mitigate errors that arise from uncertainties in foreground modeling; 2)
foreground contamination can be significantly reduced for experiments with fine
angular resolution; 3) most of the statistical significance in a positive
detection during the Dark Ages comes from a characteristic high-redshift trough
in the 21cm brightness temperature; and 4) Measurement errors decrease more
rapidly with integration time for instruments with fine angular resolution. We
show that if observations and algorithms are optimized based on these findings,
an instrument with a 5 degree beam can achieve highly significant detections
(greater than 5-sigma) of even extended (high Delta-z) reionization scenarios
after integrating for 500 hrs. This is in contrast to instruments without
angular resolution, which cannot detect gradual reionization. Abrupt ionization
histories can be detected at the level of 10-100's of sigma. The expected

consistent with membership in the Columba association, implying a corresponding

points to a model-dependent companion mass ~12.8 MJup. The host star's
estimated mass of 2.4-2.5 Msun places it among the most massive stars ever
known to harbor an extrasolar planet or low-mass brown dwarf. While the mass of
the companion is close to the deuterium burning limit, its mass ratio, orbital

two 2x2 tiles centered on (l, b) = (30, 0) deg and (l, b) = (59, 0) deg, to
study the star formation activity using a large sample of well selected young

fields using the number of candidate YSOs and their average time scale to reach
the Zero Age Main Sequence, and compare it with the rate estimated using their
integrated luminosity at 70 micron combined with an extragalactic star
formation indicator. We measure a SFR of (9.5 +- 4.3)*10^{-4} Msol/yr and (1.6

deg, respectively. Results with the 70 micron estimator are (2.4 +-
0.4)*10^{-4} Msol/yr and (2.6 +- 1.1)*10^{-6} Msol/yr. Since the 70 micron

serves as a basis for many other quantum impurity models. We provide a
comprehensive analysis of the non-equilibrium transport near a quantum phase
transition in a spinless dissipative resonant-level model, extending earlier
work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 216803 (2009)]. A detailed derivation of a rigorous
mapping of our system onto an effective Kondo model is presented. A controlled
energy-dependent renormalization group approach is applied to compute the
non-equilibrium current in the presence of a finite bias voltage V. In the
linear response regime V ->0, the system exhibits as a function of the
dissipative strength a localized-delocalized quantum transition of the
Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) type. We address fundamental issues of the
non-equilibrium transport near the quantum phase transition: Does the bias
voltage play the same role as temperature to smear out the transition? What is
the scaling of the non-equilibrium conductance near the transition? At finite
temperatures, we show that the conductance follows the equilibrium scaling for
V< T, while it obeys a distinct non-equilibrium profile for V>T. We furthermore
provide new signatures of the transition in the finite-frequency current noise
and AC conductance via the recently developed Functional Renormalization Group
(FRG) approach. The generalization of our analysis to non-equilibrium transport
through a resonant level coupled to two chiral Luttinger-liquid leads,
generated by the fractional quantum Hall edge states, is discussed. Our work on
dissipative resonant level has direct relevance to the experiments in a quantum
dot coupled to resistive environment, such as H. Mebrahtu et al., Nature 488,

formed during major mergers of gas-rich late-type galaxies. Generalizing the
results of the hydro-simulations from Mayer et al. 2010, we envision a scenario
in which a supermassive star can form at the center of galaxies that just
experienced a major merger owing to a multi-scale powerful gas inflow, provided
that such galaxies live in haloes with masses above 10^{11} Msun, are gas-rich
and disc-dominated, and do not already host a massive black hole. We assume
that the ultimate collapse of the supermassive star leads to the rapid
formation of a black hole of 10^5 Msun following a quasi-star stage. Using a
model for galaxy formation applied to the outputs of the Millennium Simulation,
we show that the conditions required for this massive black hole formation
route to take place in the concordance LambdaCDM model are actually common at
high redshift, and can be realized even at low redshift. Most major mergers
above z~4 in haloes with mass > 10^{11} Msun can lead to the formation of a
massive seed and, at z~2, the fraction of favourable mergers decreases to about
half. Interestingly, we find that even in the local universe a fraction (~20%)
of major mergers in massive haloes still satisfy the conditions for our massive
black hole formation route. Those late events take place in galaxies with a
markedly low clustering amplitude, that have lived in isolation for most of
their life, and that are experiencing a major merger for the first time. We
predict that massive black hole seeds from galaxy mergers can dominate the
massive end of the mass function at high (z>4) and intermediate (z~2) redshifts
relative to lighter seeds formed at higher redshift, for example, by the
collapse of Pop III stars. Finally, a fraction of these massive seeds could
lie, soon after formation, above the MBH-MBulge relation.

quantum correction, which is not considered by the CCM but by the other two,
plays a role only when the metal gate is exceedingly close to the graphene

how a background potential linear in position can be achieved in graphene, are

by treating metal contacts in the same way, the last example shows that the PDM

unattainable to the same components organized or mixed in simpler ways. For
instance, the bones and teeth of mammals are far stronger and more durable than
the mineral phases from which they are derived because their constituents are
organized hierarchically from the molecular scale to the macroscale. Making
similarly functional synthetic hierarchical materials will require an
understanding of how to promote the self-assembly of structure on multiple
lengthscales, without falling foul of numerous possible kinetic traps. Here we
use computer simulation to study the self-assembly of a simple hierarchical
structure, a square crystal lattice whose repeat unit is a tetramer. Although
the target material is organized hierarchically, it self-assembles most
reliably when its dynamic assembly pathway consists of the sequential addition
of monomers to a single structure. Hierarchical dynamic pathways via dimer and
tetramer intermediates are also viable modes of assembly, but result in general
in lower yield: these intermediates have a stronger tendency than monomers to
associate in ways not compatible with the target structure. In addition,
assembly via tetramers results in a kinetic trap whereby material is
sequestered in trimers that cannot combine to form the target crystal. We use
analytic theory to relate dynamical pathways to the presence of equilibrium
phases close in free energy to the target structure, and to identify the
thermodynamic principles underpinning optimum self-assembly in this model: 1)
make the free energy gap between the target phase and the most stable fluid
phase of order kT, and 2) ensure that no other dense phases (liquids or
close-packed solids of monomers or oligomers) or fluids of incomplete building
blocks fall within this gap.

studies, driven by new experimental applications, which also motivate the study
of Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) in low dimensions. From the theoretical
point of view there are few, quite special, models in which we are able to
prove BEC for interacting bosons. With the aim of studying the condensation
problem I considered a simplified model for a three and two dimensional system
of bosons interacting with a repulsive short range potential, obtained by
introducing an ultraviolet momentum cutoff. I proved that the interacting
theory is well defined at all orders in terms of one (in three dimensions) or
two (in two dimensions) effective parameters, related to the intensity of the
interaction. Moreover the correlations do not exhibit anomalous dimensions,
i.e. the model is in the same universality class of the exactly soluble
Bogoliubov model. The result is obtained by using Rigorous Renormalization
Group techniques and implementing local Ward identities (WI), which reduce the
number of independent running couplings, this fact being crucial for the
control of the two dimensional theory, where the effective interactions are
relevant. Since the ultraviolet momentum cutoff breaks local gauge invariance,
the corrections to the formal WI have been considered.

spectra and the distribution of host galaxies of strong MgII systems from the
spectra of background quasars. We present a suite of models that predict, the
dependence of MgII absorption on a galaxy's apparent inclination, impact
parameter(b) and azimuthal angle. The variations in the absorption strength
with azimuthal angles provide much stronger constraints on the intrinsic
geometry of the MgII absorption than the dependence on the galaxy's
inclination. Strong MgII absorbers (W_r(2796)>0.3) are asymmetrically
distributed in azimuth around their host galaxies:72% of the absorbers studied
and 100% of the close-in absorbers within b<35 kpc, are located within 50deg of
the host galaxy's projected minor axis. Composite models consisting either of a
simple bipolar component plus a spherical or disk component, or a single highly
softened bipolar distribution, can well represent the azimuthal dependencies
observed in both the datasets. Simultaneously fitting both datasets to the
composite model, bipolar cone is confined to 50deg of the minor axis and
contains 2/3 of the total MgII absorption. The single softened cone model has
an exponential fall off with azimuth with an exponential scale-length in
opening angle of 45deg. We conclude that the distribution of MgII gas at low
impact parameters is not the same as that found at high impact parameters. MgII
absorption within 40 kpc primarily arises from cool MgII gas entrained in
winds. Beyond 40 kpc, there is evidence for a more symmetric distribution,
significantly different from that closer into the galaxies. Here a significant
component appears aligned more with the disk and is possibly inflowing, perhaps
as part of a galactic fountain or the inflow of material from further out in
the system.

optical spectroscopy of five fields of its light echo system. The light echoes
allow the first few hundred days of the explosion to be reobserved, with
different position angles providing different viewing angles to the supernova.
Light echo spectroscopy therefore allows a direct spectroscopic comparison of
light originating from different regions of the photosphere during the early
phases of SN 1987A. Gemini multi-object spectroscopy of the light echo fields
shows fine-structure in the H-alpha line as a smooth function of position angle
on the near-circular light echo rings. H-alpha profiles originating from the
northern hemisphere of SN 1987A show an excess in redshifted emission and a
blue knee, while southern hemisphere profiles show an excess of blueshifted
H-alpha emission and a red knee. This fine-structure is reminiscent of the
""Bochum event"" originally observed for SN 1987A, but in an exaggerated form.
Maximum deviation from symmetry in the H-alpha line is observed at position
angles 16 and 186 degrees, consistent with the major-axis of the expanding
elongated ejecta. The asymmetry signature observed in the H-alpha line smoothly
diminishes as a function of viewing angle away from the poles of the elongated
ejecta. We propose an asymmetric two-sided distribution of 56Ni most dominant
in the southern far quadrant of SN 1987A as the most probable explanation of
the observed light echo spectra. This is evidence that the asymmetry of
high-velocity 56Ni in the first few hundred days after explosion is correlated
to the geometry of the ejecta some 25 years later.

announced by the Microlensing Observations in Astrophysics survey on
2010-03-18.
  This event was remarkable because the source was previously known to be
photometrically variable. Analyzing the pre-event source lightcurve, we
demonstrate that it is an irregular variable over time scales >200d. Its
dereddened color, $(V-I)_{S,0}$, is 1.221$\pm$0.051mag and from our lens model
we derive a source radius of 14.7$\pm$1.3 $R_{\odot}$, suggesting that it is a
red giant star.
  We initially explored a number of purely microlensing models for the event
but found a residual gradient in the data taken prior to and after the event.
This is likely to be due to the variability of the source rather than part of
the lensing event, so we incorporated a slope parameter in our model in order
to derive the true parameters of the lensing system.
  We find that the lensing system has a mass ratio of q=0.0654$\pm$0.0006. The
Einstein crossing time of the event, $T_{\rm{E}}=44.3$\pm$0.1d, was
sufficiently long that the lightcurve exhibited parallax effects. In addition,
the source trajectory relative to the large caustic structure allowed the
orbital motion of the lens system to be detected. Combining the parallax with
the Einstein radius, we were able to derive the distance to the lens,
$D_L$=2.8$\pm$0.4kpc, and the masses of the lensing objects. The primary of the
lens is an M-dwarf with $M_{L,p}$=0.16$\pm0.03M_{\odot}$ while the companion
has $M_{L,s}$=11.0$\pm2.0M_{\rm{J}}$ putting it in the boundary zone between
planets and brown dwarfs.

fluid-structure interactions subject to thermal fluctuations. We show how the
viscous coupling between the immersed structures and the fluid can be
simplified in the regime where this coupling becomes increasingly strong. Many
descriptions in fluid mechanics and in the formulation of computational methods
account for fluid-structure interactions through viscous drag terms to transfer
momentum from the fluid to immersed structures. In the inertial regime, this
coupling often introduces a prohibitively small time-scale into the temporal
dynamics of the fluid-structure system. This is further exacerbated in the
presence of thermal fluctuations. We discuss here a systematic reduction
technique for the full inertial equations to obtain a simplified description
where this coupling term is eliminated. This approach also accounts for the
effective stochastic equations for the fluid-structure dynamics. The analysis
is based on use of the Infinitesmal Generator of the SPDEs and a singular
perturbation analysis of the Backward Kolomogorov PDEs. We also discuss the
physical motivations and interpretation of the obtained reduced description of

measurements of the cosmic radio background and faint features in the sky
spectrum at long wavelengths that arise from redshifted 21-cm from gas in the
reionization epoch. SARAS operates in the octave band 87.5-175 MHz. We present
herein the system design arguing for a complex correlation spectrometer
concept. The SARAS design concept provides a differential measurement between
the antenna temperature and that of an internal reference termination, with
measurements in switched system states allowing for cancellation of additive
contaminants from a large part of the signal flow path including the digital
spectrometer. A switched noise injection scheme provides absolute spectral
calibration. Additionally, we argue for an electrically small
frequency-independent antenna over an absorber ground. Various critical design
features that aid in avoidance of systematics and in providing calibration
products for the parametrization of other unavoidable systematics are described
and the rationale discussed. The signal flow and processing is analyzed and the
response to noise temperatures of the antenna, reference termination and
amplifiers is computed. Multi-path propagation arising from internal
reflections are considered in the analysis, which includes a harmonic series of
internal reflections. We opine that the SARAS design concept is advantageous
for precision measurement of the absolute cosmic radio background spectrum;
therefore, the design features and analysis methods presented here are expected
to serve as a basis for implementations tailored to measurements of a
multiplicity of features in the background sky at long wavelengths, which may
arise from events in the dark ages and subsequent reionization era.

dimensions of which correspond to categories by which mortality rates are
reported, such as age, sex, country and year. Regression models for such data
typically assume an independent error distribution or an error model that
allows for dependence along at most one or two dimensions of the data array.
However, failing to account for other dependencies can lead to inefficient
estimates of regression parameters, inaccurate standard errors and poor
predictions. An alternative to assuming independent errors is to allow for
dependence along each dimension of the array using a separable covariance
model. However, the number of parameters in this model increases rapidly with
the dimensions of the array and, for many arrays, maximum likelihood estimates
of the covariance parameters do not exist. In this paper, we propose a submodel
of the separable covariance model that estimates the covariance matrix for each
dimension as having factor analytic structure. This model can be viewed as an
extension of factor analysis to array-valued data, as it uses a factor model to
estimate the covariance along each dimension of the array. We discuss
properties of this model as they relate to ordinary factor analysis, describe
maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation methods, and provide a likelihood
ratio testing procedure for selecting the factor model ranks. We apply this
methodology to the analysis of data from the Human Mortality Database, and show
in a cross-validation experiment how it outperforms simpler methods.
Additionally, we use this model to impute mortality rates for countries that
have no mortality data for several years. Unlike other approaches, our
methodology is able to estimate similarities between the mortality rates of
countries, time periods and sexes, and use this information to assist with the
imputations.

\tau and on the parameter \varkappa which relates the mean bag surface to its

the Fisher and the Griffiths scaling inequalities are not fulfilled in general

surprising for the phase diagram with the asymmetric properties of pure phases,

estimate the total energy feedback, $E_{\rm Feedback}$, into the clusters. The
profiles for the energy deposition, $\Delta E_{\rm ICM}(x)$, in the inner
regions differ for Cool-Core (CC) and Non Cool-Core (NCC) clusters, decreasing
after accounting for the radiative cooling. The total feedback energy scales
with the mean spectroscopic temperature as $E_{\rm Feedback} \propto T_{\rm

  Fern\'andez (DIMM)","Report: Error estimation of recovered solution in FE analysis",,,,,"cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recovery type error estimators introduced by Zienkiewicz and Zhu use a
recovered stress field evaluated from the Finite Element (FE) solution. Their
accuracy depends on the quality of the recovered field. In this sense, accurate
results are obtained using recovery procedures based on the Superconvergent
Patch recovery technique (SPR). These error estimators can be easily
implemented and provide accurate estimates. Another important feature is that
the recovered solution is of a better quality than the FE solution and can
therefore be used as an enhanced solution. We have developed an SPR-type
recovery technique that considers equilibrium and displacements constraints to
obtain a very accurate recovered displacements field from which a recovered
stress field can also be evaluated. We propose the use of these recovered
fields as the standard output of the FE code instead of the raw FE solution.
Techniques to quantify the error of the recovered solution are therefore
needed. In this report we present an error estimation technique that accurately
evaluates the error of the recovered solution both at global and local levels
in the FEM and XFEM frameworks. We have also developed an h-adaptive mesh
refinement strategy based on the error of the recovered solution. As the
converge rate of the error of the recovered solution is higher than that of the
FE one, the computational cost required to obtain a solution with a prescribed
accuracy is smaller than for traditional h-adaptive processes.

after a preshear at a given stress the fluid tends to accelerate when it is
submitted to a lower stress. Viscosity bifurcation displays here original
features: the yield stress and the critical shear rate depend on the previous

the material structure can be adjusted at will through an appropriate flow
history. In particular it is possible to tune the material yield stress to
arbitrary low values. A simple model assuming that the stress is the sum of one

This paper treats the case of an electron together with the Dirac sea in the
absence of any external field. Such a system is described by its one-body
density matrix, an infinite rank, self-adjoint operator which is a compact
pertubation of the negative spectral projector of the free Dirac operator. The
parameters of the model are the coupling constant $\alpha>0$ and the
ultraviolet cut-off $\Lambda>0$: we consider the subspace of squared integrable
functions made of the functions whose Fourier transform vanishes outside the
ball $B(0,\La)$. We prove the existence of minimizers of the BDF-energy under
the charge constraint of one electron and no external field provided that
$\alpha,\La^{-1}$ and $\alpha\llo$ are sufficiently small. The interpretation
is the following: in this regime the electron creates a polarization in the
Dirac vacuum which allows it to bind. We then study the non-relativistic limit
of such a system in which the speed of light tends to infinity (or equivalently
$\alpha$ tends to zero) with $\alpha\llo$ fixed: after rescaling the electronic
solution tends to the Choquard-Pekar ground state.

IGO updates the parameter of the probability distribution along the natural
gradient, taken with respect to the Fisher metric on the parameter manifold,
aiming at maximizing an adaptive transform of the objective function. IGO
recovers several known algorithms as particular instances: for the family of
Bernoulli distributions IGO recovers PBIL, for the family of Gaussian
distributions the pure rank-mu CMA-ES update is recovered, and for exponential
families in expectation parametrization the cross-entropy/ML method is
recovered. This article provides a theoretical justification for the IGO
framework, by proving that any step size not greater than 1 guarantees monotone
improvement over the course of optimization, in terms of q-quantile values of
the objective function f. The range of admissible step sizes is independent of
f and its domain. We extend the result to cover the case of different step
sizes for blocks of the parameters in the IGO algorithm. Moreover, we prove
that expected fitness improves over time when fitness-proportional selection is
applied, in which case the RPP algorithm is recovered.

core-localized modes such as Beta Induced Alfv\'en Eigenmodes and Reversed
Shear Alfv\'en Eigenmodes driven by fast particles can lead to significant
redistribution and losses in fusion devices. This is observed in many ASDEX
Upgrade discharges. The present work aims to understand the underlying
resonance mechanisms, especially in the presence of multiple modes with
different frequencies. Resonant mode coupling mechanisms are investigated using
the drift kinetic HAGIS code [Pinches 1998]. Simulations were performed for
different plasma equilibria, in particular for different q profiles, employing
the availability of improved experimental data. A study was carried out,
investigating double-resonant mode coupling with respect to various overlapping
scenarios. It was found that, depending on the radial mode distance,
double-resonance is able to enhance growth rates as well as mode amplitudes
significantly. Small radial mode distances, however can also lead to strong
nonlinear mode stabilization of a linear dominant mode. With the extended
version of HAGIS, losses were simulated and directly compared with experimental
loss measurements. The losses' phase space distribution as well as their
ejection signal is consistent with experimental data. Furthermore, it allowed
to characterize them as prompt, resonant or stochastic. It was found that
especially in multiple mode scenarios (with different mode frequencies),
abundant incoherent losses occur in the lower energy range, due to a broad
phase-space stochastization. The incoherent higher energetic losses are
""prompt"", i.e. their initial energy is too large for confined orbits.

in form of a 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. Electrons with a temperature
of 32 keV are uniformly distributed within a cloud with a radius of 14.2
electron skin depths. They expand under their thermal pressure and carry with
them the cold protons, which are initially concentrated in a hollow ring at the
boundary of the electron cloud. The interior of the ring contains an immobile
positive charge background that compensates for the electron charge. The
protons expand in form of a circularly symmetric rarefaction wave and they
extract energy from the electrons. A thermal anisotropy of the electrons
develops and triggers through a Weibel-type instability the growth of TM waves
within the plasma cloud, which acts as a wave guide. The changing cross section
of this waveguide introduces a coupling between the TM wave and a TE wave and
in-plane magnetic fields grow. The relevance of the simulation results to a
previous experimental study of a laser-ablated wire is discussed.

Galaxy center distance R_0, the angular rotation velocity at the LSR Omega_0,
mean peculiar motion of the sources with respect to Galactic rotation (U_src,
V_src, W_src), rotation-curve shape index, and the V component of the Solar
peculiar motions V_sun. Based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, we find
that the Galaxy center distance is constrained at a 5% level to be R_0 = 8.05
+/- 0.45 kpc, where the error bar includes both statistical and systematic
errors. We also find that the two components of the source peculiar motion
U_src and W_src are fairly small compared to the Galactic rotation velocity,
being U_src = 1.0 +/- 1.5 km/s and W_src = -1.4 +/- 1.2 km/s. Also, the
rotation curve shape is found to be basically flat between Galacto-centric
radii of 4 and 13 kpc. On the other hand, we find a linear relation between
V_src and V_sun as V_src = V_sun -19 (+/- 2) km/s, suggesting that the value of
V_src is fully dependent on the adopted value of V_sun. Regarding the rotation
speed in the vicinity of the Sun, we also find a strong correlation between
Omega_0 and V_sun. We find that the angular velocity of the Sun, Omega_sun,
which is defined as Omega_sun = Omega_0 + V_sun/R_0, can be well constrained
with the best estimate of Omega_sun = 31.09 +/- 0.78 km/s/kpc. This corresponds
to Theta_0 = 238 +/- 14 km/s if one adopts the above value of R_0 and recent
determination of V_sun ~ 12 km/s.

This distribution is convenient since it fully characterizes analytically with
only two parameters (the shape and scale parameters) the shape of distribution
and the different moments of the wind speed (mean, standard deviation, skewness
and kurtosis). This distribution is broadly used in the wind energy sector to
produce maps of wind energy potential. However, the Weibull distribution is
based on empirical rather than physical justification and might display strong
limitations for its applications. The philosophy of this article is based on
the modeling of the wind components instead of the wind speed itself. This

energy that is released when a magnetic field becomes unstable, as a result of
continual convective driving. Aims: We present new results obtained from
nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of idealised coronal loops. The
purpose of this work is to determine whether or not the simulation results
agree with Taylor relaxation, which will require a modified version of
relaxation theory applicable to unbounded field configurations. Methods: A
three-dimensional (3D) MHD Lagrangian-remap code is used to simulate the
evolution of a line-tied cylindrical coronal loop model. This model comprises
three concentric layers surrounded by a potential envelope; hence, being
twisted locally, each loop configuration is distinguished by a
piecewise-constant current profile. Initially, all configurations carry
zero-net-current fields and are in ideally unstable equilibrium. The simulation
results are compared with the predictions of helicity conserving relaxation
theory. Results: For all simulations, the change in helicity is no more than 2%
of the initial value; also, the numerical helicities match the
analytically-determined values. Magnetic energy dissipation predominantly
occurs via shock heating associated with magnetic reconnection in distributed
current sheets. The energy release and final field profiles produced by the
numerical simulations are in agreement with the predictions given by a new
model of partial relaxation theory: the relaxed field is close to a linear
force free state; however, the extent of the relaxation region is limited,
while the loop undergoes some radial expansion. Conclusions: The results
presented here support the use of partial relaxation theory, specifically, when
calculating the heating-event distributions produced by ensembles of

assume the presence of an extreme population directly formed from the AGB and

with the chemical inventory of the cluster NGC 2419. At such a low metallicity,
the HBB temperatures (well above 108K) allow a very advanced nucleosynthesis.
Masses of about 6Mo deplete Mg and synthesize Si, going beyond Al, so this
latter element results only moderately enhanced; sodium can not be enhanced.
The models are consistent with the observations, although the predicted Mg
depletion is not as strong as in the observed stars. We predict that the oxygen
abundance must be depleted by a huge factor in the Mg poor stars. The HBB
temperatures are close to the region where other p capture reactions on heavier
nuclei become possible. We show that high potassium abundance found in Mg poor
stars can be achieved during HBB, by p captures on the argon nuclei, if the
relevant cross section(s) are larger than listed in the literature or if the
HBB temperature is higher. Finally, we speculate that some calcium production
is occurring owing to proton capture on potassium. We emphasize the importance

Heisenberg model with long-range interactions on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice

fascinating spin ordering sequence observed in TmB4 and other rare-earth
tetraborides. The simulation reproduces the experimental 1/2 magnetization
plateau at low temperature by considering multifold long range interactions. It
is found that more local long range interactions can be satisfied in the 1/2
plateau state than those in the 1/3 plateau state, leading to the stabilization
of the extended 1/2 plateau. A mean-field theory on the spin ground states in
response to magnetic field is proposed, demonstrating the simulation results.
When the energies of the Neel state and the collinear state are degenerated,
the former state is more likely to be stabilized due to the competitions among
the local collinear spin orders. The present work provides a comprehensive
proof of the phase transitions to the Neel state at nonzero temperature, in
complimentary to the earlier predictions for the Fe-based superconductors.

primarily deaf children, but children with language disorders. Using sign
language as a support in conversation has been shown to greatly stimulate the
speech development of such children. The signer is captured with an RGB-D
(Kinect) sensor, which has three advantages over a regular RGB camera. Firstly,
it allows complex backgrounds to be removed easily. We segment the hands and
face based on skin color and depth information. Secondly, it helps with the
resolution of hand over face occlusion. Thirdly, signs take place in 3D; some
aspects of the signs are defined by hand motion vertically to the image plane.
This motion can be estimated if the depth is observable. The 3D motion of the
hands relative to the torso are used as a cue together with the hand shape, and
HMMs trained with this input are used for classification. To obtain higher
robustness towards differences across signers, Fisher Linear Discriminant

suitable for any practical display application. Upon UV (365 nm) photolysis,
the PL intensity augmented to ~170% and attained a saturation value after ~100
minutes of exposure. This is attributed to the photo-corrosion mechanism
exerted by high-flux UV light on ZnS:Ag,Al QDs. Auxiliary enhancement of PL
intensity to 250% has been evidenced by subjecting the QDs to high temperatures
(200oC) and pressures (~120 bars) in a sulphur-rich atmosphere, which is due to
the improvement in crystallanity of ZnS QDs. The origin of the bright blue PL
has been discussed. The results were supported by x-ray phase analysis,

that the situation is reversed at D = 2. The need to regularize the many-body
theory in a gauge-invariant manner (taking the limit D = 2 - \epsilon) is what
leads to the dominance of the parity-breaking pattern in graphene. We compute
the critical coupling for the generation of a parity-breaking mass from the

by a variety of processes such as disk instabilities and/or mergers.
Classifying bulge stellar particles identified at z=0 into old and young
according to these two phases, we found bulge stellar sub-populations with
distinct kinematics, shapes, stellar ages and metal contents. The young
components are more oblate, generally smaller, more rotationally supported,
with higher metallicity and less alpha-element enhanced than the old ones.
These results are consistent with the current observational status of bulges,
and provide an explanation for some apparently paradoxical observations, such
as bulge rejuvenation and metal-content gradients observed. Our results suggest
that bulges of L* galaxies will generically have two bulge populations which
can be likened to classical and pseudo-bulges, with differences being in the
relative proportions of the two, which may vary due to galaxy mass and specific
mass accretion and merger histories.

the operation of many critical infrastructures that our society depend on, such

potential impact of a successful attack could lead to disastrous consequences
in the physical world, ensuring the security of these systems is of vital
importance. A fundamental prerequisite to securing a SCADA system is a clear
understanding and a consistent view of its architecture. However, because of
the complexity and scale of SCADA systems, this is challenging to acquire. In
this paper, we propose a layered architectural view for SCADA systems, which
aims at building a common ground among stakeholders and supporting the
implementation of security analysis. In order to manage the complexity and

of viewpoints to focus on a subset of the system. We indicate the applicability

considered. Our objectives are to study magnetic energy build up, storage and
dissipation as a result of emergence, cancellation, and flyby of these magnetic
elements. In the future these interactions will be the basic building blocks of
more complicated simulations involving hundreds of elements. Each interaction
is simulated in the presence of an overlying uniform magnetic field, which lies
at various orientations with respect to the evolving magnetic elements. For
these three small-scale interactions, the free energy stored in the field at
the end of the simulation ranges from $0.2-2.1\times 10^{26}$ ergs, while the
total energy dissipated ranges from $1.3-6.3\times 10^{26}$ ergs. For all
cases, a stronger overlying field results in higher energy storage and
dissipation. For the cancellation and emergence simulations, motion
perpendicular to the overlying field results in the highest values. For the
flyby simulations, motion parallel to the overlying field gives the highest
values. In all cases, the free energy built up is sufficient to explain
small-scale phenomena such as X-ray bright points or nanoflares. In addition,
if scaled for the correct number of magnetic elements for the volume
considered, the energy continually dissipated provides a significant fraction
of the quiet Sun coronal heating budget.

univariate regression function of bounded variation. The underpinning idea is
to combine two classical tools in nonparametric statistics, namely isotonic
regression and the estimation of additive models. A geometrical interpretation
enables us to link this iterative method with Von Neumann's algorithm.
Moreover, making a connection with the general property of isotonicity of
projection onto convex cones, we derive another equivalent algorithm and go
further in the analysis. As iterating the algorithm leads to overfitting,
several practical stopping criteria are also presented and discussed.

type II. We assumed that the expansion $(\theta)$ in the model is proportional
to the shear $(\sigma)$. To get exact solution, we have considered the equation
of state of the fluid to be in the stiff form. It is found that the bulk
viscosity plays a very important rule in the history of the universe. In
presence of bulk viscosity the particles dominate over strings whereas in
absence of it, strings dominate over the particles which is not in consistence
with the recent observations. Also we observe that the viscosity caused the
expansion of the universe to be accelerating. Our models are evolving from an
early decelerating phase to a late time accelerating phase. The physical and
geometrical behavior of these models are discussed.

in the 5-10 Myr old Upper Scorpius OB association. For 116 objects originally
identified in UKIDSS, the majority of them not studied in previous
publications, we obtain photometry from the WISE database. The resulting
colour-magnitude and colour-colour plots clearly show two separate populations
of objects, interpreted as brown dwarfs with disks (class II) and without disks
(class III). We identify 27 class II brown dwarfs, 14 of them not previously
known. This disk fraction (27 out of 116 or 23%) among brown dwarfs was found
to be similar to results for K/M stars in Upper Scorpius, suggesting that the
lifetimes of disks are independent of the mass of the central object for
low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. 5 out of 27 disks (19%) lack excess at 3.4 and
4.6 microns and are potential transition disks (i.e. are in transition from
class II to class III). The transition disk fraction is comparable to low-mass
stars. We estimate that the timescale for a typical transition from class II to
class III is less than 0.4 Myr for brown dwarfs. These results suggest that the
evolution of brown dwarf disks mirrors the behaviour of disks around low-mass
stars, with disk lifetimes on the order of 5-10 Myr and a disk clearing
timescale significantly shorter than 1 Myr.

Bulletin (REB) issued by the International Data Centre. The REB includes 1200
aftershocks between April 11 and May 25 with body wave magnitudes from 3.05 to
6.19. To automatically recover the sequence, we selected sixteen aftershocks
with mb between 4.5 and 5.0. These events evenly but sparsely cover the area of
the most intensive aftershock activity as recorded during the first two days
after the main shock. In our study, waveform templates from only seven IMS
array stations with the largest SNRs estimated for the signals from the main
shock were used to calculate cross-correlation coefficients over the entire
period of 44 days. Approximately 1000000 detections obtained using
cross-correlation were then used to build events according to the IDC
definition. After conflict resolution between events with similar arrivals
built by more than one master all qualified event hypotheses populated the
automatic cross-correlation Standard Event List (aXSEL). The total number of
distinct hypotheses was 2763. To evaluate the quality of new events in the
aXSEL, we randomly selected a small portion of XSEL events and analysts
reviewed them according to standard IDC rules and guidelines. After the
interactive review of a small portion of the final product of cross correlation
was obtained which we call the interactive XSEL. We have constructed relevant
frequency and probability density distributions for all detections, all
associated detection,and for those which were associated with the aXSEL and
final XSEL events. These distributions are also station and master dependent.
