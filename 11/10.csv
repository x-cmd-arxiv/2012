well-known stable marriage problem. In an allocation problem, edges of a
bipartite graph have capacities and vertices have quotas to fill. Here we
investigate the case of uncoordinated processes in stable allocation instances.
In this setting, a feasible allocation is given and the aim is to reach a
stable allocation by raising the value of the allocation along blocking edges
and reducing it on worse edges if needed. Do such myopic changes lead to a
stable solution?
  In our present work, we analyze both better and best response dynamics from
an algorithmic point of view. With the help of two deterministic algorithms we
show that random procedures reach a stable solution with probability one for
all rational input data in both cases. Surprisingly, while there is a
polynomial path to stability when better response strategies are played (even
for irrational input data), the more intuitive best response steps may require
exponential time. We also study the special case of correlated markets. There,
random best response strategies lead to a stable allocation in expected
polynomial time.

forming regions the starless core spatial surface density distribution is very
similar to that of the young stellar objects. This, taken together with the
similarity between the core mass function and the initial mass function for

rate, suggest that the cloud fragmentation process defines the global outcome
of star formation. This ""simple"" view of star formation may not hold on all
scales. In particular dynamical interactions are expected to become important
at the conditions required to form young massive clusters. We describe the
successes of a simple criterion to identify young massive cluster precursors in
our Galaxy based on (sub-)millimetre wide area surveys. We further show that in
the location of our Galaxy where the best candidate for a precursor of a young
massive cluster is found, the ""simple"" scaling relationship between dense gas
and star formation rate appear to break down. We suggest that in regions where
the conditions approach those of the central molecular zone of our Galaxy it
may be necessary to revise the scaling laws for star formation.

time. Each arc is equipped with a transit time that specifies how long flow
takes to traverse it, while flow rates may vary over time within the given edge
capacities. In this paper, we extend this concept of a dynamic optimization
problem to the more general setting of abstract flows. In this model, the
underlying network is replaced by an abstract system of linearly ordered sets,
called ""paths"" satisfying a simple switching property: Whenever two paths P and
Q intersect, there must be another path that is contained in the beginning of P
and the end of Q.
  We show that a maximum abstract flow over time can be obtained by solving a
weighted abstract flow problem and constructing a temporally repeated flow from
its solution. In the course of the proof, we also show that the relatively
modest switching property of abstract networks already captures many essential
properties of classical networks.

the space $\bT$ of pointed isometry classes of locally compact rooted real
trees equipped with the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. Some of the main results of
the paper are a general tightness criterion in $\bT$ and limit theorems for
growing families of trees. We apply these results to Galton-Watson trees with
exponentially distributed edge lengths. This class is preserved by hereditary
reduction. Then we consider families of such Galton-Watson trees that are
consistent under hereditary reduction and that we call growth processes. We
prove that the associated families of offspring distributions are completely
characterised by the branching mechanism of a continuous-state branching
process. We also prove that such growth processes converge to Levy forests. As
a by-product of this convergence, we obtain a characterisation of the laws of
Levy forests in terms of leaf-length erasure and we obtain invariance

MDC methods to improve their performance - at the expense of an increased
computational cost. In this paper we focus on the classifier chains (CC)
approach for modeling dependencies, one of the most popular and highest-
performing methods for multi-label classification (MLC), a particular case of
MDC which involves only binary classes (i.e., labels). The original CC
algorithm makes a greedy approximation, and is fast but tends to propagate
errors along the chain. Here we present novel Monte Carlo schemes, both for
finding a good chain sequence and performing efficient inference. Our

Weibo from both macro and micro levels. From the macro level, Tencent users are
more active on forwarding messages, but with less reciprocal relationships than
Twitter users, their topic preferences are very different from Twitter users

unique features of Tencent users. According to our studies, Tencent users'

more important part in the whole networks. Based on the above analysis, we
design a graphical model for predicting users' forwarding behaviors. Our
experimental results on the large Tencent Weibo data validate the correctness

methodology for analysis of finite sensor networks. Furthermore, we consider
two models for such networks: unreliable sensor grids, and sensor networks with
random node deployment. We provide easily computable expressions for bounds on
the coverage and connectivity of these networks. With validation from
simulations, we show that the derived analytic expressions give very good
estimates of such quantities for finite sensor networks. Our investigation
confirms the fact that small-scale networks possesses unique characteristics
different from the large-scale counterparts, necessitating the development of a
new framework for their analysis and design.

  Aims: We aim to obtain the first robust redshift measurement and
classification of a z > 1.5 SDF SN Ia host galaxy candidate
  Methods: We use the X-shooter (U-to-K-band) spectrograph on the Very Large
Telescope to allow the detection of different emission lines in a wide spectral
range.
  Results: We measure a spectroscopic redshift of 1.54563 +/- 0.00027 of
hSDF0705.25, consistent with its photometric redshift of 1.552 +/- 0.018. From
the strong emission-line spectrum we rule out AGN activity, thereby confirming
the optical transient as a SN. The host galaxy follows the fundamental
metallicity relation defined in Mannucci et al. (2010, 2011) showing that the
properties of this high-redshift SN Ia host galaxy is similar to other field
galaxies.
  Conclusions: Spectroscopic confirmation of additional SDF SN hosts would be

magnetic changes associated with six major flares using 12-minute, 0.5-arcsec
vector magnetograms from NASA's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager instrument
(HMI) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory satellite. The six major flares
occurred near the main magnetic neutral lines of four active regions, NOAA
11158, 11166, 11283 and 11429. During all six flares the neutral line field
vectors became stronger and more horizontal, in each case almost entirely due
to strengthening of the horizontal field components parallel to the neutral
line. In all six cases the neutral line pre-flare fields were more vertical
than the reference potential fields, and collapsed abruptly and permanently
closer to potential field tilt angles during every flare, implying that the
relaxation of magnetic stress associated with non-potential tilt angles plays a
major role during major flares. The shear angle with respect to the reference
potential field did not show such a pattern, demonstrating that flare processes
do not generally relieve magnetic stresses associated with photospheric
magnetic shear. The horizontal fields became significantly and permanently more
aligned with the neutral line during the four largest flares, suggesting that
the collapsing field is on average more aligned with the neutral line than the
pre-flare neutral line field. The vertical Lorentz force had a large, abrupt,
permanent downward change during each of the flares, consistent with loop
collapse. The horizontal Lorentz force changes acted mostly parallel to the
neutral line in opposite directions on each side, a signature of the fields
contracting during the flare, pulling the two sides of the neutral line towards
each other. The greater effect of the flares on field tilt than on shear may be
explained by photospheric line-tying.

and Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) magnetograms to compare ultraviolet
(UV) emissions from the chromosphere to longitudinal magnetic field changes in
the photosphere during four X-class solar flares. An abrupt, significant, and
persistent change in the magnetic field occurred across more than ten pixels in
the GONG magnetograms for each flare. These magnetic changes lagged the GOES
flare start times in all cases, showing that they were consequences and not
causes of the flares. Ultraviolet emissions were spatially coincident with the
field changes. The UV emissions tended to lag the GOES start times for the
flares, and led the changes in the magnetic field in all pixels except one. The
UV emissions led the photospheric field changes by 4 minutes on average with
the longest lead being 9 minutes, however, the UV emissions continued for tens
of minutes, and more than an hour in some cases, after the field changes were
complete. The observations are consistent with the picture in which an
Alfv\'{e}n wave from the field reconnection site in the corona propagates field
changes outward in all directions near the onset of the impulsive phase,
including downwards through the chromosphere and into the photosphere, causing
the photospheric field changes, whereas the chromosphere emits in the UV in the
form of flare kernels, ribbons and sequential chromospheric brightenings during
all phases of the flare.

then have prohibitively low internal error rates. Here we describe a method by
which even error-prone cells can perform purification: groups of cells generate

coherence time and can be transmitted over long distances. These properties are
a consequence of their weak interactions within a nearly linear medium. To
create and manipulate nonclassical states of light, however, one requires a
strong, nonlinear interaction at the single photon level. One approach to
generate suitable interactions is to couple photons to atoms, as in the strong
coupling regime of cavity QED systems. In these systems, however, one only
indirectly controls the quantum state of the light by manipulating the atoms. A
direct photon-photon interaction occurs in so-called Kerr media, which
typically induce only weak nonlinearity at the cost of significant loss. So
far, it has not been possible to reach the single-photon Kerr regime, where the
interaction strength between individual photons exceeds the loss rate. Here,
using a 3D circuit QED architecture, we engineer an artificial Kerr medium
which enters this regime and allows the observation of new quantum effects. We
realize a Gedankenexperiment proposed by Yurke and Stoler, in which the
collapse and revival of a coherent state can be observed. This time evolution
is a consequence of the quantization of the light field in the cavity and the
nonlinear interaction between individual photons. During this evolution
non-classical superpositions of coherent states, i.e. multi-component
Schroedinger cat states, are formed. We visualize this evolution by measuring
the Husimi Q-function and confirm the non-classical properties of these
transient states by Wigner tomography. The single-photon Kerr effect could be
employed in QND measurement of photons, single photon generation, autonomous
quantum feedback schemes and quantum logic operations.

yields three z~9-10 candidates. While we have already reported the most robust
of these candidates, MACS1149-JD, two additional z~9 candidates are also found
and have H_{160}-band magnitudes of ~26.2-26.9. A careful assessment of various
sources of contamination suggests <~1 contaminants for our z~9-10 selection. To
determine the implications of these search results for the LF and SFR density
at z~9, we introduce a new differential approach to deriving these quantities
in lensing fields. Our procedure is to derive the evolution by comparing the
number of z~9-10 galaxy candidates found in CLASH with the number of galaxies
in a slightly lower redshift sample (after correcting for the differences in
selection volumes), here taken to be z~8. This procedure takes advantage of the
fact that the relative volumes available for the z~8 and z~9-10 selections
behind lensing clusters are not greatly dependent on the details of the lensing
models. We find that the normalization of the UV LF at z~9 is just
0.28_{-0.20}^{+0.39}\times that at z~8, ~1.4_{-0.8}^{+3.0}x lower than
extrapolating z~4-8 LF results. While consistent with the evolution in the UV
LF seen at z~4-8, these results marginally favor a more rapid evolution at z>8.
Compared to similar evolutionary findings from the HUDF, our result is less
insensitive to large-scale structure uncertainties, given our many independent
sightlines on the high-redshift universe.

project studying M-theory compactified on a manifold of G2 holonomy, with
significant contributions from Jing Shao, Eric Kuflik, and others, and
particularly co-led by Bobby Acharya and Piyush Kumar. The M-theory results
include: stabilization of all moduli in a de Sitter vacuum; gauge coupling
unification; derivation of TeV scale physics (solving the hierarchy problem);
the derivation that generically scalar masses are equal to the gravitino mass
which is larger than about 30 TeV; derivation of the Higgs mechanism via
radiative electroweak symmetry breaking; absence of the flavor and CP problems,
and the accommodation of string axions. tan beta and the mu parameter are part
of the theory and are approximately calculated; as a result, the little
hierarchy problem is greatly reduced. This paper summarizes the results
relevant to the Higgs mass prediction. A recent review describes the program
more broadly. Some of the results such as the scalar masses being equal to the
gravitino mass and larger than about 30 TeV, derived early in the program, hold
generically for compactified string theories as well as for compactified
M-theory, while some other results may or may not. If the world is described by
M-theory compactified on a G2 manifold and has a Higgs mechanism (so it could
be our world) then the Higgs mass was predicted to be 126 +/- 2 GeV before the
measurement. The derivation has some assumptions not related to the Higgs mass,
but involves no free parameters.

PACS spectra, extracted within a projected distance of <= 2000 AU centered on
the protostar. The total luminosity of the CO lines observed with PACS (L(CO))
is found to increase with increasing L_bol. The CO rotational temperature
implied by the line ratios increases with J, and at least 3-4 rotational
temperature components are required to fit the observed rotational diagram. The
rotational temperature components are remarkably invariant between protostars
and show no dependence on L_bol, T_bol or envelope density, implying that if
the emitting gas is in LTE, the CO emission must arise in multiple temperature
components that remain independent of L_bol over two orders of magnitudes. The
observed CO emission can also be modeled as arising from a single temperature
gas component or from a medium with a power-law temperature distribution; both
of these require sub-thermally excited molecular gas at low densities (n(H_2)
<= 10^6 cm^-3) and high temperatures (T >= 2000 K). Our results suggest that
the contribution from PDRs along the envelope cavity walls is unlikely to be
the dominant component of the CO emission observed with PACS. Instead, the
""universality"" of the rotational temperatures and the observed correlation
between L(CO) and L_bol can most easily be explained if the observed CO
emission originates in shock-heated, hot (T >= 2000 K), sub-thermally excited
(n(H_2) <= 10^6 cm^-3) molecular gas. Post-shock gas at these densities is more
likely to be found within the outflow cavities along the molecular outflow or
along the cavity walls at radii >= several 100-1000 AU.

invaluable tools for a wide range of applications in precision spectroscopy and

whispering-gallery mode microresonators (""microcombs"") has been developed
recently, which represents a promising route towards chip-level integration and
out-of-the-lab use of these devices. Presently, two families of microcombs have
been demonstrated: combs with electronically detectable mode spacing that can

but mode spacings beyond electronic detection limits. However, it has not yet
been possible to achieve these two key requirements simultaneously, as will be
critical for most microcomb applications. Here we present a key step to
overcome this problem by interleaving an electro-optic comb with the spectrum

principle with these generalized entropies, making them useful for
understanding distribution functions of non-Markovian or non-ergodic complex
systems. For such systems where the composability axiom is violated there exist
only two ways to implement the maximum entropy principle, one using escort

hierarchical structures: (AB)b, (AB)C, and A(BC). We analyzed the {\it Kepler}
light curve by including a third light source and one starspot on each binary
component. The results represent that the close eclipsing pair is in a low-mass
eccentric-orbit, detached configuration. Based on 123 eclipse timings
calculated from the Wilson-Devinney binary model, a period study of the close
binary reveals that the orbital period has experienced a sinusoidal variation
with a period and a semi-amplitude of 205$\pm$2 d and 0.0021$\pm$0.0002 d,
respectively. The period variation would be produced by the light-travel-time
effect due to a gravitationally-bound third body with a minimum mass of $M_3
\sin i_3$=0.76 M$_\odot$ in an eccentric orbit of $e_3$=0.61. This is
consistent with the presence of third light found in our light-curve solution
and the tertiary signal of 204.2 d period most likely arises from the K-type
star crossed by the close eclipsing binary. Then, KIC002856960 is a triply
eclipsing hierarchical system, A(BC), consisting of a close binary with two
M-type dwarfs and a more massive K-type component. The presence of the third

  The current work shows that fast convergence also occurs for the following

  - All pairs of goods are complements to each other, and - the demand and
income elasticities are suitably bounded.
  In particular, these conditions hold when all buyers in the market are
equipped with CES utilities, where all the parameters $\rho$, one per buyer,
satisfy $-1 < \rho \le 0$.

conclude that its spatial structure is inconsistent with a modal

fluctuations are acoustic spiral waves interior to the orbits of the clumps. We
show that the two nonaxisymmetric standing shock structures that exist in the
inner regions of these tilted flows effectively amplify the variability caused
by these spiral waves to markedly higher levels than in untilted flows, which
lack standing shocks. Our identification of clumps, spirals, and spiral-shock
interactions in these fully general relativistic, magnetohydrodynamical

a specific position on the sample is tedious. This is an important limitation
of many Scanning Probe Microscopes, in particular when the sample has to be
removed for some kind of treatment and then re-allocated to characterize the
same position where the previous experiment had been performed. In the present
work we describe two simple and compact sub micron-precision sample holders
that can be easily integrated in to a commercial Scanning Force Microscopy
system. The design is based either on a traditional kinematic mounting or on
self-adjustment of the sample holder and the upper piece of the piezoelectric
scanner as the glue used to assemble the final setup solidifies. With these
sample holders a specific sample position is automatically recovered to within
about 100 nanometers, and thus well within the typical range of a piezoelectric
scanner. Our experimental setup therefore allows ex-situ manipulation of the
sample and SFM imaging of the same region without the aid of an optical
microscope, positioning marks and tedious re-allocation.

rotation rate, we introduce a ""disorder"" potential, breaking the rotational

slowly varied and find forced tunneling between the system's eigenstates. The
non-adiabaticity is signaled by the appearance of a swallow-tail loop in the
lowest-energy level, a general sign of hysteresis. Then, we show that this
system is in one-to-one correspondence with a trapped gas in a double-well

that self-trapping is a direct manifestation of the behavior of the

a correlation coefficient above 0.60 for both ac- tive regions. Additionally,
there seems to be a phase lag between the evolutions of the unweighted current

Kepler mission must account for systematic errors and biases. Transit detection
depends not only on the planet's radius and orbital period, but also on host
star properties. Thus, a sample of stars with transiting planets may not
accurately represent the target population. Moreover, targets are selected
using criteria such as a limiting apparent magnitude. These selection effects,
combined with uncertainties in stellar radius, lead to biases in the properties
of transiting planets and their host stars. We quantify possible biases in the
Kepler survey. First, Eddington bias produced by a steep planet radius
distribution and uncertainties in stellar radius results in a 15-20%
overestimate of planet occurrence. Second, the magnitude limit of the Kepler
target catalog induces Malmquist bias towards large, more luminous stars and
underestimation of the radii of about one third of candidate planets,
especially those larger than Neptune. Third, because metal-poor stars are
smaller, stars with detected planets will be very slightly (<0.02 dex) more
metal-poor than the target average. Fourth, uncertainties in stellar radii
produce correlated errors in planet radius and stellar irradiation. A previous
finding, that highly-irradiated giant are more likely to have ""inflated"" radii,
remains significant, even accounting for this effect. In contrast, transit
depth is negatively correlated with stellar metallicity even in the absence of
any intrinsic correlation, and a previous claim of a negative correlation
between giant planet transit depth and stellar metallicity is probably an
artifact.

submatrix having largest average value. As a dual result, we establish that the
size of the largest square sub-matrix with average bigger than a fixed positive
constant is, with high probability, equal to one of two consecutive integers
that depend on the threshold and the matrix dimension $n$. The second part of
the paper addresses local maxima. Specifically we consider submatrices with
dominant row and column sums that arise as the local optima of iterative search
procedures for large average submatrices. For fixed $k$, we identify the
limiting average value and joint distribution of a $k \times k$ submatrix
conditioned to be a local maxima. In order to understand the density of such
local optima and explain the quick convergence of such iterative procedures, we
analyze the number $L_n(k)$ of local maxima, beginning with exact asymptotic
expressions for the mean and fluctuation behavior of $L_n(k)$. For fixed $k$,
the mean of $L_{n}(k)$ is $\Theta(n^{k}/(\log{n})^{(k-1)/2})$ while the
standard deviation is $\Theta(n^{2k^2/(k+1)}/(\log{n})^{k^2/(k+1)})$. Our
principal result is a Gaussian central limit theorem for $L_n(k)$ that is based
on a new variant of Stein's method.

an emerging trend for parallel programming to fully exploit distributed
shared-memory architecture. In this paper, we improve the performance of MPEG-2
encoder and n-body simulation by employing the hybrid MPI-OpenMP programming
paradigm on SMP clusters. The hierarchical image data structure of the MPEG
bit-stream is eminently suitable for the hybrid model to achieve multiple
levels of parallelism: MPI for parallelism at the group of pictures level
across SMP nodes and OpenMP for parallelism within pictures at the slice level
within each SMP node. Similarly, the work load of the force calculation which
accounts for upwards of 90% of the cycles in typical computations in the n-body
simulation is shared among OpenMP threads after ORB domain decomposition among
MPI processes. Besides, loop scheduling of OpenMP threads is adopted with
appropriate chunk size to provide better load balance of work, leading to
enhanced performance. With the n-body simulation, experimental results
demonstrate that the hybrid MPI-OpenMP program outperforms the corresponding
pure MPI program by average factors of 1.52 on a 4-way cluster and 1.21 on a
2-way cluster. Likewise, the hybrid model offers a performance improvement of
18% compared to the MPI model for the MPEG-2 encoder.

that enable accurate phenotype prediction and that are supported by the
literature.

recent results from the ATLAS3D Survey. I discuss the occurrence of young
stellar ages, cold gas, and ongoing star formation in early-type galaxies, the
presence of which gives important clues to the evolutionary path of these
galaxies. Consideration of empirical star formation histories gives a
meaningful picture of galaxy stellar population properties, and allows accurate
comparison of mass estimates from populations and dynamics. This has recently
provided strong evidence of a non-universal IMF, as supported by other recent
evidences. Spatially-resolved studies of stellar populations are also crucial
to connect distinct components within galaxies to spatial structures seen in
other wavelengths or parameters. Stellar populations in the faint outer
envelopes of early-type galaxies are a formidable frontier for observers, but
promise to put constraints on the ratio of accreted stellar mass versus that
formed 'in situ' - a key feature of recent galaxy formation models. Galaxy
environment appears to play a key role in controlling the stellar population
properties of low mass galaxies. Simulations remind us, however, that current
day galaxies are the product of a complex assembly and environment history,
which gives rise to the trends we see. This has strong implications for our
interpretation of environmental trends.

during the pure hadronic phase and the hadron-quark-gluon mixed phase
transition, also for small deviations from the standard Boltzmann-Gibbs
statistics.

degeneracy of the node structure. In the presence of a random gap we analyze
the scaling behavior of the localization length as a function of the system
width within a numerical transfer-matrix approach. Depending on the strength of
the randomness, there are different scaling regimes for weak, intermediate and
strong disorder. These regimes are separated by transitions that are
characterized by one-parameter scaling.

  interdependent networks",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a system of interdependent networks, an initial failure of nodes invokes a
cascade of iterative failures that may lead to a total collapse of the whole
system in a form of an abrupt first order transition. When the fraction of
initial failed nodes $1-p$ reaches criticality, $p=p_c$, the abrupt collapse
occurs by spontaneous cascading failures. At this stage, the giant component
decreases slowly in a plateau form and the number of iterations in the cascade,
$\tau$, diverges. The origin of this plateau and its increasing with the size
of the system remained unclear. Here we find that simultaneously with the
abrupt first order transition a spontaneous second order percolation occurs
during the cascade of iterative failures. This sheds light on the origin of the
plateau and on how its length scales with the size of the system. Understanding
the critical nature of the dynamical process of cascading failures may be
useful for designing strategies for preventing and mitigating catastrophic
collapses.

nearest-neighbor interactions lead to a spatial variance structure on the
lattice. The resulting spatial pattern fluctuates in value from point to point
in a manner characteristic of a stationary stochastic process. The value at a
lattice point in the simulation is interpreted as an inten-sity level and the
difference in values in neighboring cells produces a fluctuating intensity
pattern on the lattice. Changing the size of the mesh changes the relative size
of the speckles. Increasing the mesh size tends to average out the intensity in
the direction of the mean of the stationary process.

address some of the common difficulties and misconceptions of the normal force,
especially the relationship between normal and friction forces. Accordingly, it
is intentionally informal and conversational in tone to teach students how to
build an intuition to complement mathematical formalism. This is accomplished
by beginning with common and everyday experience and then guiding students
toward two realizations: (i) That real objects are deformable even when
deformations are not easily visible, and (ii) that the relation between
friction and normal forces follows from the action-reaction principle. The
traditional formulae under static and kinetic conditions are then analyzed to
show that peculiarity of the normal-friction relationship follows readily from
observations and knowledge of physics principles.

  3-part article",,,,"math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this final part of a 3-part paper we introduce the pair of ""wings"" of the
abstract PL-colored complexes $\mathcal{H}_{m}^\star$, described in the second
paper. The wings, via a weight enhanced Tutte's barycentric embedding of a
planar map, produce the unexpected reformutation of a 3-dimensionl problem into
a 2-dimensional one. The total number of edges in each one of the pair of final
wings is less than $8n-5$. Tutte's method is applied O(n) times to each one of
the 2 wings in the final pair to assure rectilinearity of the embeddings of the
planar maps, which include the final wings. A cone construction over the final
wings provides a PL-complex $\mathcal{H}_1^\diamond$, which contain the set of
0-simplices $\{a_1, a_2,...,a_f\} \cup \{b_1, b_2,...,b_g\}$ (as defined in the
second part of the article) properly fixed in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The other
0-simplices are obtained by bisections of segments linking previously defined
points. This implies that $\mathcal{H}_n$ is PL-embedded into $\mathbb{R}^3$.
We then conclude the surgery description of the 3-manifold induced by the gem
with its resolution by defining some disjoint cylinders contained in
$\mathcal{H}_{n}^\star$, directly from the hinges (dual of the twistors of the
resolution), in a 1-1 correspondence. The medial curves of the cylinders define
the link we seek. The framing of a medial curve is the linking number of the
boundary components of the corresponding cylinder. The analysis of the whole
proccess shows that the memory and time requirement to complete the algorithm
is O(n^2). Data for the Weber-Seifert 3-manifold, which answers Jeffrey Weeks's
question is given in the appendix. It consists of a link with 142 crossings but
it admits simplifications.
