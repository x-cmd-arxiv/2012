codebooks allowing to achieve the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise
channel, as well as the optimal rate-distortion trade-off for a Gaussian
source. The proof is self-contained and relies only on basic probabilistic and
geometrical arguments. An ensemble of nested lattices that is different, and
more elementary, than the one used in previous proofs is introduced. This
ensemble is based on lifting different subcodes of a linear code to the
Euclidean space using Construction A. In addition to being simpler, our
analysis is less sensitive to the assumption that the additive noise is
Gaussian. In particular, for additive ergodic noise channels it is shown that
the achievable rates of the nested lattice coding scheme depend on the noise
distribution only via its power. Similarly, the nested lattice source coding
scheme attains the same rate-distortion trade-off for all ergodic sources with
the same second moment.

argue it is incomplete but we put forward a modified version, based on the
author's 'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis', which, we claim, gives a
more satisfactory understanding and also a resolution to the Information Loss
Puzzle. This hypothesis pictures a black hole equilibrium as an, overall pure,
state, with given energy, consisting of a black hole with its (mostly matter)
atmosphere in a box and identifies the black hole's entropy with the pure
state's matter-gravity entanglement entropy. We assume this equilibrium goes
over, at weak string-coupling, to a pure state with similar energy consisting
of a long string with a stringy atmosphere and that the matter-gravity
entanglement entropy goes over to the entanglement entropy between
(approximately) the long string and the stringy atmosphere. We also recall
recent work (in a non-gravitational context) towards modern foundations for
thermodynamics, where, in place of a total microcanonical ensemble, one assumes
that a total system, consisting of a small (sub)system and an energy bath, is
in a (random) pure state with energy in a given narrow range and shows that the
small subsystem will then find itself in a thermal state. We present a new set
of formulae, obtained in a companion paper, which generalize the setting of
that work to cases where the system and energy bath are of comparable size. We
apply these formulae to a model for our string equilibrium where the densities
of states of the long string (replacing our energy bath) and stringy atmosphere
(replacing our system) both grow exponentially. We find, for our picture of
black hole equilibrium, a temperature of the order of the Hawking temperature
and an entropy of the order of the Hawking entropy thus adding to the evidence
for the viablity of our matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis.

successive giant pulses fluctuates rapidly and their occurrence rates within a
day's observations as well as between neighboring days show large variations.
While on some days PSR B0950+08 shows a large number of giant pulses, there are
other days when it shows only ""quasi-nulls"" with no detectable emission in the

distribution of these giant pulses appears to follow a power law, with index
-2.2. After eliminating instrumental, ionospheric, interplanetary and

appears that these intensity variations are intrinsic to the pulsar. We suggest
that the giant pulse emission and nulling may be opposite manifestations of the

partaking in the coherent radiation process giving rise to an extremely high
intensity while in the latter case the coherence could be minimal.

presence of a uniform and perpendicular magnetic field, by seriously taking
into account the finite thickness of the Quantum Well (QW) along the field. We
find internal phase transitions (i.e. at partial LL filling) for the global
magnetization and magnetic susceptibility that are not captured by other
approaches, and that give rise to nontrivial corrections to the standard de
Haas-van Alphen periods (but in a manner that reproduces the exact quantal
deviations from the semiclassical periodicity in the limit of the full 3D

independently solve analytically as well for comparison). Additional features
upon inclusion of Zeeman splitting are also found (such as certain energy
minima that originate from the interplay of QW, Zeeman and LL Physics in the
full 3D problem), while a corresponding calculation in a Composite Fermion
picture (with Lambda-Levels) leads to new predictions on magnetic response
properties of a fully-interacting electron liquid in a finite-thickness
interface; these exhibit a richer and more delicate structure than the mere
monotonic reduction of gaps with thickness reported long ago, a structure
possibly detectable with present day technology. Finally, by pursuing the same
line of reasoning for a topologically nontrivial system (with a relativistic
spectrum, spin-orbit interactions and strong coupling between thickness and

topological solitons in two space dimensions. Its action functional consists of
a potential term, a kinetic term quadratic in derivatives (the ""nonlinear sigma
model term"") and the Skyrme term quartic in first derivatives. The limiting
case of vanishing sigma model term (the so-called BPS baby Skyrme model) is
known to support exact soliton solutions saturating a BPS bound which exists
for this model. Further, the BPS model has infinitely many symmetries and
conservation laws. Recently it was found that the gauged version of the BPS
baby Skyrme model with gauge group U(1) and the usual Maxwell term, too, has a
BPS bound and BPS solutions saturating this bound. This BPS bound is determined
by a superpotential which has to obey a superpotential equation, in close
analogy to the situation in supergravity. Further, the BPS bound and the
corresponding BPS solitons only may exist for potentials such that the
superpotential equation has a global solution. We also briefly describe some
properties of soliton solutions.

of the original maps with the surrogate maps then allows to test for the
existence of higher order correlations in the original maps, also and

image analysis technique we calculate the deviation between the original data
and 500 surrogates for different hemispheres in the sky and find ecliptic
hemispherical asymmetries between northern and southern ecliptic sky. We find
strong deviations from Gaussianity in the WMAP data when considering the low-l
range with l = [2,20]. The analysis technique of the scaling indices leads to a
slightly lower deviation. Although the underlying foreground reduction methods
of the maps differ from each other, we find similar results for the WMAP 7yr
ILC map and the WMAP 7yr (needlet-based) NILC map in the low-l range. Our
results point once more to a cosmological nature of the signal. For a higher l
range with l = [120,300] the results differ between the two image analysis
techniques and between the two maps which makes an intrinsic nature of the

carried out were derived by taking into account the complete evolutionary
history of the progenitor stars, with special emphasis on the diffusion
processes acting during the white dwarf cooling phase. We computed nonradial
$g$-modes to assess the dependence of the pulsational properties of these
objects with stellar parameters such as the stellar mass and the effective
temperature, and also with element diffusion processes. We also performed a g-
and p-mode pulsational stability analysis on our models and found well-defined
blue edges of the instability domain, where these stars should start to exhibit
pulsations. We found substantial differences in the seismic properties of white
dwarfs with $M_* \gtrsim 0.20 M_{\odot}$ and the extremely low-mass (ELM) white
dwarfs ($M_* \lesssim 0.20 M_{\odot}$). Specifically, $g$-mode pulsation modes
in ELM white dwarfs mainly probe the core regions and are not dramatically
affected by mode-trapping effects by the He/H interface, whereas the opposite
is true for more massive He-core white dwarfs. We found that element diffusion
processes substantially affects the shape of the He/H chemical transition
region, leading to non-negligible changes in the period spectrum of low-mass
white dwarfs. Our stability analysis successfully predicts the pulsations of
the only known variable low-mass white dwarf (SDSS J184037.78+642312.3), and
also predicts both $g$- and $p$-mode pulsational instabilities in a significant
number of known low-mass and ELM white dwarfs.

Susskind-Horowitz-Polchinski scenario in which black hole entropy goes over to
string entropy as one scales the string length scale up and the string coupling
constant down, keeping Newton's constant unchanged. In our approach, based on
our 'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis', 'string entropy' here should be
interpreted as the likely entanglement entropy between (approximately) the
single long string and the stringy atmosphere which, as we argue, arise in a
pure multistring state of given energy in a (rescaled) box. In a previous
simple analysis, we computed this entropy (with promising results) by assuming
simple exponentially increasing densities of states for both long string and
stringy atmosphere. Here, our starting point is a (more correct) density of
states for each single string with the appropriate inverse-power prefactor and
a low-energy cutoff. We outline how the relevant entanglement entropy should be
calculated for this system and propose a plausible model, which draws on the
work of Mitchell and Turok on the multi-string microcanonical ensemble, in
which we adopt a similar density of states for long string and stringy
atmosphere but now with cutoffs which scale with the total energy, E. With this
scaling, we still find our entanglement entropy grows, in leading order,
linearly with E and this translates to a black-hole entropy which goes as the
square of the black-hole mass, thus retaining most of the promising features of
our previous exponential-density-of-states model and providing further evidence
for our matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis.

settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the
algorithm. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental
to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently
critical to evaluating a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these
parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new
problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal
experience and intuition in ways that are hard to describe. Since the
performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the
algorithm and the details of its tuning, it can be difficult to determine
whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.
  In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyper
parameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools to replace
hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach
is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g.
classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from parameters
that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even
which processing steps are included. A hyper parameter optimization algorithm
transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric.
Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision
problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task
(PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single algorithm.
More broadly, we argue that the formalization of a meta-model supports more
objective, reproducible, and quantitative evaluation of computer vision
algorithms, and that it can serve as a valuable tool for guiding algorithm
development.

signature that determines whether a given superconducting system can support
Majorana zero modes. Here we show that such a winding can be faithfully
identified for any superconducting system (p-wave or s-wave with spin-orbit
coupling) through a set of time-of-flight measurements, making it a diagnostic
tool also in actual cold atom experiments. As an application, we specialize the
measurement scheme for a chiral topological model of spinless fermions. The
proposed model only requires the experimentally accessible s-wave pairing and
staggered tunnelling that mimics spin-orbit coupling. By adiabatically
connecting this model to Kitaev's honeycomb lattice model, we show that it
gives rise to nu = \pm 1 phases, where vortices bind Majorana fermions, and
nu=\pm 2 phases that emerge as the unique collective state of such vortices.
Hence, the preparation of these phases and the detection of their Chern numbers
provide an unambiguous signature for the presence of Majorana modes. Finally,
we demonstrate that our detection procedure is resilient against most

planet migration has a strong effect on the compositions of simulated
terrestrial planets as the migration results large-scale mixing between
terrestrial planet building blocks that condensed at a range of temperatures.
This mixing acts to 1) increase the typical abundance of Mg-rich silicates in
the terrestrial planets feeding zones and thus increase the frequency of
planets with Earth-like compositions compared with simulations with static
giant planet orbits; and 2) drastically increase the efficiency of the delivery
of hydrous phases (water and serpentine) to terrestrial planets and thus
produce water worlds and/or wet Earths. Our results demonstrate that although a
wide variety of terrestrial planet compositions can still be produced, planets
with Earth-like compositions should be common within extrasolar planetary
systems.

population in 140 GHz Bolocam observations of a set of 45 massive galaxy
clusters. We use a combination of 1.4 and 30 GHz data to select a total of 28
probable cluster-member radio galaxies and also to predict their 140 GHz flux
densities. All of these galaxies are steep-spectrum radio sources and they are
found preferentially in the cool-core clusters within our sample. In
particular, 11 of the 12 brightest cluster member radio sources are associated
with cool-core systems. Although none of the individual galaxies are robustly
detected in the Bolocam data, the ensemble-average flux density at 140 GHz is
consistent with, but slightly lower than, the extrapolation from lower
frequencies assuming a constant spectral index. In addition, our data indicate
an intrinsic scatter of 30 percent around the power-law extrapolated flux
densities at 140 GHz, although our data do not tightly constrain this scatter.
For our cluster sample, which is composed of high-mass and moderate-redshift
systems, we find that the maximum fractional change in the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
signal integrated over any single cluster due to the presence of these radio
sources is 20 percent, and only 1/4 of the clusters show a fractional change of
more than 1 percent. The amount of contamination is strongly dependent on
cluster morphology, and nearly all of the clusters with more than 1 percent
contamination are cool-core systems. This result indicates that radio
contamination is not significant compared to current noise levels in 140 GHz
images of massive clusters and is in good agreement with the level of radio
contamination found in previous results based on lower frequency data or

to the traditional optical selection of targets biasing surveys towards the
most ultra-violet luminous objects, where the intense radiation excites the
neutral gas to the point where it cannot engage in star formation. However,
this hypothesis does not explain why there is a critical luminosity, rather
than a continuum where the detections gradually become fewer and fewer as the
harshness of the radiation increases. We show that by placing a quasar within a
galaxy of gas there is always a finite ultra-violet luminosity above which all
of the gas is ionised. This demonstrates that these galaxies are probably
devoid of star-forming material rather than this being at abundances below the
sensitivity limits of current radio telescopes.

of two non-equivalent locations of pnictogen (chalcogen) above and below the

disappear first around k_z =pi/2, and vertical line nodes split into two
vertical loops centered at k_z =0 and k_z = pi. We also show that the
hybridization moves the nodes along the loops away from the normal state Fermi
surfaces. This creates a subset of k-points at which the peak in the spectral
function does not shift as the system enters into a superconducting state

mu_B*(L+2S.B), where L and S are the orbital and spin angular momentum
operators, respectively, summed over all electrons. For helium, a long-standing
experimental-theoretical discrepancy for P states motivates a reevaluation of
the higher-order terms which follow from relativistic quantum theory and
quantum electrodynamics (QED). The tensor structure of relativistic corrections
involves scalar, vector, and symmetric and anti-symmetric tensor components. We
perform a tensorial reduction of these operators in a Cartesian basis, using an
approach which allows us to separate the internal atomic from the external

The evaluation proceeds in a Cartesian basis of helium eigenstates, using a
weighted sum over the magnetic projections. For the relativistic corrections,
this leads to a verification of previous results obtained using the
Wigner-Eckhart theorem. The same method, applied to the radiative correction
(Bethe logarithm term) leads to a spin-dependent correction which is different

report a mechanism for colloidal assembly and pattern formation on smooth and
uniform substrates. Below a critical withdrawal speed of the substrate,
capillary forces required to deform the meniscus prevent colloidal particles
from entering the coating film. Capillary forces are overcome by hydrodynamic
drag only after a minimum number of particles organize in a close-packed
formation within the meniscus. Once within the film, the formed assembly moves
at nearly the withdrawal speed and rapidly separates from the next assembly.
The interplay between hydrodynamic and capillary forces can thus produce
periodic and regular structures within the curved meniscus that extends below
the withdrawn film. The hydrodynamically-driven assembly documented here is
consistent with stripe pattern formations observed experimentally in the
so-called thin-film entrainment regime.

preservation of some important properties of the input program. By regarding
programs as Kripke structures, many interesting properties of programs can be
expressed in temporal logics. In temporal logic, a formula is interpreted on a
single program. However, to prove correctness of transformations, we encounter
formulae which contain some subformulae interpreted on the input program and
some on the transformed program. An example where such a situation arises is
verification of optimizing program transformations applied by compilers.
  In this paper, we present a logic called Temporal Transformation Logic (TTL)
to reason about such formulae. We consider different types of primitive
transformations and present TTL inference rules for them. Our definitions of
program transformations and temporal logic operators are novel in their use of
the boolean matrix algebra. This results in specifications that are succinct

standard models developed for epidemiology spreading, to represent sudden and
intense workload variations. As an essential step we also derive a heuristic

performance of our estimator on synthetic time series. We show how good can our
model fit to real workload traces with respect to the stationary case in terms
of steady-state probability and autocorrelation structure. We find that the
resulting model verifies a Large Deviation Principle that statistically
characterizes extreme rare events, such as the ones produced by ""buzz effects""

valuable insight on expectable abnormal behaviors of systems. We exploit the
information obtained using the Large Deviation Principle for the proposed Video

these policies for elastic resource provisioning and usage may be of some

that for a radiation fluid, and thus, in particular, cannot provide any effects
that mimic dark energy. However, it is far from obvious if this property of the
effective gravitational stress-energy tensor is a specific nature held only in
the Einstein gravity, or holds also in other theories of gravity. In
particular, when considering modified gravity theories that involve higher
order derivative terms, one may expect to have some non-negligible effects
arising from higher order derivatives of short-wavelength perturbations. In
this paper, we argue this is not the case at least in the cosmological context.
We show that when the background, or coarse-grained metric averaged over
several wavelengths has FLRW symmetry, the effective gravitational
stress-energy tensor for metric perturbations of a cosmological model in a
simple class of f(R) gravity theories, as well as that obtained in the
corresponding scalar-tensor theory, takes a similar form to that in general

produce biased sample. The sampling bias issue has been resolved in the
literature for the case which involves baseline or time-varying covariates that
are observable. The problem remains open, however, for the important case where
longitudinal covariates are present in survival models. A joint likelihood
approach has been shown in the literature to provide an effective way to
overcome those difficulties for right-censored data, but this approach faces
substantial additional challenges in the presence of left truncation. Here we
thus propose an alternative likelihood to overcome these difficulties and show
that the regression coefficient in the survival component can be estimated
unbiasedly and efficiently. Issues about the bias for the longitudinal
component are discussed. The new approach is illustrated numerically through
simulations and data from a multi-center AIDS cohort study.

traffic breakdown corresponds to a boundary-induced phase transition from free
flow to congested traffic. In this paper, we study the ability of selected

belonging to the subsystem. If these trajectories can be approximated by
classical trajectories, then the conditional wave function can be approximated
by a wave function which satisfies Schrodinger equation in a classical

significantly deviating from the Bohmian ones, implying that Bohmian velocities

(DSA) at astrophysical shocks by performing time-dependent kinetic simulations,
in which phenomenological models for magnetic field amplification (MFA),
Alfvenic drift, thermal leakage injection, Bohm-like diffusion, and a free
escape boundary are implemented. If the injection fraction of cosmic-ray (CR)
particles is greater than 2x10^{-4}, for the shock parameters relevant for
young supernova remnants, DSA is efficient enough to develop a significant
shock precursor due to CR feedback, and magnetic field can be amplified up to a
factor of 20 via CR streaming instability in the upstream region. If scattering
centers drift with Alfven speed in the amplified magnetic field, the CR energy
spectrum can be steepened significantly and the acceleration efficiency is
reduced. Nonlinear DSA with self-consistent MFA and Alfvenic drift predicts
that the postshock CR pressure saturates roughly at 10 % of the shock ram
pressure for strong shocks with a sonic Mach number ranging 20< M_s< 100. Since
the amplified magnetic field follows the flow modification in the precursor,
the low energy end of the particle spectrum is softened much more than the high
energy end. As a result, the concave curvature in the energy spectra does not
disappear entirely even with the help of Alfvenic drift. For shocks with a
moderate Alfven Mach number (M_A<10), the accelerated CR spectrum can become as
steep as E^{-2.1}-E^{-2.3}, which is more consistent with the observed CR
spectrum and gamma-ray photon spectrum of several young supernova remnants.

self-trapped' (MST) state with finite number imbalance. By choosing appropiate
intial state we study above dynamical branches quantum mechanically and compare
with classical dynamics. The stability region of the '$\pi$-oscillation' is
separated from that of 'MST' state at a critical coupling strength. Also a
significant change in the energy spectrum takes place above the critical
coupling strength, and pairs of (quasi)-degenerate excited states appear. The
original model of BJJ can be mapped on to a simple Hamiltonian describing
quantum particle in an 'effective potential' with an effective Planck constant.
Different dynamical states and degenerate excited states in the energy spectrum

derive a lower bound on the random code secrecy capacity for the average error

We show that in the case of a non-symmetrisable channel to the legitimate
receiver the deterministic code secrecy capacity equals the random code secrecy
capacity, a result similar to Ahlswede's dichotomy result for ordinary AVCs.
Using this we can derive that the lower bound is also valid for the

based on the elimination technique introduced by Ahlswede for ordinary AVCs. We
further prove upper bounds on the deterministic code secrecy capacity in the
general case, which results in a multi-letter expression for the secrecy
capacity in the case of a best channel to the eavesdropper. Using techniques of
Ahlswede, developed to guarantee the validity of a reliability criterion, the

of comparable size. In Part 1, we show that, for given system and energy-bath
densities of states, s_S(e) and s_B(e), thermality does not hold in general, as
we illustrate when both increase as powers of energy, but that it does hold in
certain approximate senses, in both traditional and modern frameworks, when
both grow as exp(be) or as exp(qe^2) and we calculate the system entropy in
these cases. In their 'modern' version, our results rely on new quantities,
which we introduce and call the S and B 'modapprox' density operators, which,
we claim, will, with high probability, give a close approximation to the
reduced density operator for the system and energy bath when the total state of
system plus energy bath is a random pure state with energy in a narrow range.
In Part 2 we clarify the meaning of these modapprox density operators and give
arguments for our claim.
  The prime examples of non-small thermal systems are quantum black holes. Here
and in two companion papers, we argue that current string-theoretic derivations
of black hole entropy and thermal properties are incomplete and, on the
question of information loss, inconclusive. However, we argue that these
deficiencies are remedied with a modified scenario which relies on the modern
strand of our methods and results here and is based on our previous
'matter-gravity entanglement hypothesis'.

decrease the objective function along the solutions of the transformed system.
The invariance principle is applied to analyze the behavior of the solution. We
also propose a modified approach for addressing cases in which solutions do not

observed that isomers formed differ significantly in the stability, bond length

of sub lattices and the band gap is closed when dopants are placed at adjacent

pseudoscalar field is \textit{static} and \textit{prescribed} with two
adjustable parameters. These parameters determine the values of the field at
infinity ($\pm \theta_0$) and its scale of variation ($\mu$). One can build up
a field configuration with arbitrary topological charge by changing $\theta_0$,
and interpolate between the extreme adiabatic and non-adiabatic regimes by
changing $\mu$. This system is exactly solvable and therefore we compute the
Casimir energy exactly and unambiguously by using an energy density subtraction
scheme. We show that in general the Casimir energy goes to zero in the extreme
adiabatic limit, and in the extreme non-adiabatic limit when the asymptotic
values of the pseudoscalar field properly correspond to a configuration with an
arbitrary topological charge. Moreover, in general the Casimir energy is always
positive and on the average an increasing function of $\theta_0$ and always has
local maxima when there is a zero mode, showing that these configurations are
energetically unfavorable. We also compute and display the energy densities

increases with increasing geographic distances. Patterns of
isolation-by-distance are usually caused by local spatial dispersal, which
explains why differences of allele frequencies between populations accumulate
with distance. However, spatial variations of demographic parameters such as
migration rate or population density can generate non-stationary patterns of
isolation-by-distance where the rate at which genetic differentiation
accumulates varies across space. To characterize non-stationary patterns of
isolation-by-distance, we infer local genetic differentiation based on Bayesian
kriging. Local genetic differentiation for a sampled population is defined as
the average genetic differentiation between the sampled population and fictive
neighboring populations. To avoid defining populations in advance, the method
can also be applied at the scale of individuals making it relevant for
landscape genetics. Inference of local genetic differentiation relies on a
matrix of pairwise similarity or dissimilarity between populations or
individuals such as matrices of FST between pairs of populations. Simulation
studies show that maps of local genetic differentiation can reveal barriers to
gene flow but also other patterns such as continuous variations of gene flow
across habitat. The potential of the method is illustrated with 2 data sets:
genome-wide SNP data for human Swedish populations and AFLP markers for alpine
plant species. The software LocalDiff implementing the method is available at

communications that enables mobile nodes, equipped with multiple network
interface cards (NICs), to dynamically determine the most appropriate NIC to
use. Using ABPS, a mobile node can seamlessly switch to a different NIC in
order to get better performance, without causing communication interruptions at
the application level. To make this possible, NICs are kept always active and a
software monitor constantly probes the channels for available access points.
While this ensures maximum connection availability, considerable energy may be
wasted when no access points are available for a given NIC. In this paper we
address this issue by investigating the use of an ""oracle"" able to provide
information on network availability. This allows to dynamically switch on/off
NICs based on reported availability, thus reducing the power consumption. We
present a Markov model which allows us to estimate the impact of the oracle on
the ABPS mechanism: results show that significant reduction in energy
consumption can be achieved with minimal impact on connection availability. We
conclude by describing a prototype implementation of the oracle based on Web

consistent with the superbubble model. In addition, faint emission extending
beyond the Halpha shell was found, which we attribute to a blowout region. The
spectral analysis of both emission regions points to a hot shocked gas as the
likely origin of the emission. We determine the total energy stored in the

limited data on the stellar population, the input energy is poorly constrained
and, consequently, no definitive indication of a growth rate discrepancy is
seen. Using the high-sensitivity X-ray data from XMM-Newton and optical data

magnetic vesicles (polymersomes) in one step and at a high throughput. It was
shown in literature that such diblock copolymer W/O/W emulsion droplets can
evolve into polymersomes made of a thin (nanometric) magnetic membrane through
a dewetting transition of the oil phase from the aqueous internal cores usually
leading to ""acorn-like"" structures (polymer excess) sticking to the membranes.

Our model is based on interacting particles or grains and describes the
behavior of a fictitious granular material along a slope consisting of a
vertical section, i.e. with a wide thickness. The triggering of the landslide
is caused by the passing of two conditions: a threshold speed and a condition
on the static friction of the particles, the latter based on the Mohr-Coulomb
failure criterion (Coulomb 1776; Mohr 1914). The inter-particle interactions
are through a potential that, in the absence of suitable experimental data and
due to the arbitrariness of the grain dimension is modeled by means of a
potential similar to the Lennard-Jones one (Lennard-Jones 1924), i.e., with an
attractive and a repulsive part. For the updating of the particle positions we
use a MD method which results to be very suitable to simulate this type of
systems (Herrmann and Luding 1998). In order to take into account the
increasing of the pore pressure due to the rainfall, a filtration model is
considered. Finally we also introduce in the model the viscosity as a term in
the dynamic equations of motion. The outcome of simulations, from the point of
view of statistical and dynamic characterization, is quite satisfactory
relative to real landslides behavior and we can claim that this types of
modeling can represent a new method to simulate landslides triggered by

the generator coordinate method based on energy density functionals have become
widely used techniques in low-energy nuclear structure physics. Recently, it
has been pointed out that these techniques are ill-defined for standard Skyrme
functionals, and a regularization procedure has been proposed to remove the
resulting spuriosities from such calculations. This procedure imposes an
integer power of the density for the density dependent terms of the functional.
At present, only dated parameterizations of the Skyrme interaction fulfill this
condition. [Purpose] To construct a set of parameterizations of the Skyrme
energy density functional for multi-reference energy density functional
calculations with regularization using the state-of-the-art fitting protocols.
[Method] The parameterizations were adjusted to reproduce ground state
properties of a selected set of doubly magic nuclei and properties of nuclear
matter. Subsequently, these parameter sets were validated against properties of
spherical and deformed nuclei. [Results] Our parameter sets successfully
reproduce the experimental binding energies and charge radii for a wide range
of singly-magic nuclei. Compared to the widely used SLy5 and to the SIII
parameterization that has integer powers of the density, a significant
improvement of the reproduction of the data is observed. Similarly, a good
description of the deformation properties at $A\sim 80$ was obtained.
[Conclusions] We have constructed new Skyrme parameterizations with integer
powers of the density and validated them against a broad set of experimental
data for spherical and deformed nuclei. These parameterizations are tailor-made
for regularized multi-reference energy density functional calculations and can
be used to study correlations beyond the mean-field in atomic nuclei.

ultrahigh-dimensional feature selection on Big Data. To solve this problem
effectively, we first reformulate it as a convex semi-infinite programming
(SIP) problem and then propose an efficient \emph{feature generating paradigm}.
In contrast with traditional gradient-based approaches that conduct
optimization on all input features, the proposed method iteratively activates a
group of features and solves a sequence of multiple kernel learning (MKL)
subproblems of much reduced scale. To further speed up the training, we propose
to solve the MKL subproblems in their primal forms through a modified
accelerated proximal gradient approach. Due to such an optimization scheme,
some efficient cache techniques are also developed. The feature generating
paradigm can guarantee that the solution converges globally under mild
conditions and achieve lower feature selection bias. Moreover, the proposed
method can tackle two challenging tasks in feature selection: 1) group-based
feature selection with complex structures and 2) nonlinear feature selection
with explicit feature mappings. Comprehensive experiments on a wide range of
synthetic and real-world datasets containing tens of million data points with
$O(10^{14})$ features demonstrate the competitive performance of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art feature selection methods in terms of
generalization performance and training efficiency.

that forms as a result of the interaction of the jet with the external medium.
We show that in regions where the jet is well confined by the cocoon,
current-driven instabilities should develop over timescales shorter than the
expansion time of the jet's head. We speculate that these instabilities would
give rise to complete magnetic field destruction, whereby the jet undergoes a
transition from high-to-low sigma above the collimation zone. Using this
assumption, we construct a self-consistent model for the evolution of the
jet-cocoon system in an ambient medium of arbitrary density profile. We apply
the model to jet breakout in long GRBs, and show that the jet is highly
collimated inside the envelope of the progenitor star, and is likely to remain
confined well after breakout. We speculate that this strong confinement may
provide a channel for magnetic field conversion in GRB outflows, whereby the
hot, low-sigma jet section thereby produced is the source of the photospheric
emission observed in many bursts.

(sigma,rho)-domination is a general and unifying framework introduced by Telle:
a set D of vertices of a graph G is (sigma,rho)-dominating if for any v in D,
|N(v)\cap D| in sigma and for any $v\notin D, |N(v)\cap D| in rho. We mainly
show that for any sigma and rho the problem of (sigma,rho)-domination is W[2]
when parameterized by the size of the dominating set. This general statement is
optimal in the sense that several particular instances of
(sigma,rho)-domination are W[2]-complete (e.g. Dominating Set). We also prove
that (sigma,rho)-domination is W[2] for the dual parameterization, i.e. when
parameterized by the size of the dominated set. We extend this result to a
class of domination-type problems which do not fall into the
(sigma,rho)-domination framework, including Connected Dominating Set. We also
consider problems of coding theory which are related to domination-type
problems with parity constraints. In particular, we prove that the problem of
the minimal distance of a linear code over Fq is W[2] for both standard and
dual parameterizations, and W[1]-hard for the dual parameterization.
  To prove W[2]-membership of the domination-type problems we extend the
Turing-way to parameterized complexity by introducing a new kind of non
deterministic Turing machine with the ability to perform `blind' transitions,
i.e. transitions which do not depend on the content of the tapes. We prove that
the corresponding problem Short Blind Multi-Tape Non-Deterministic Turing
Machine is W[2]-complete. We believe that this new machine can be used to prove
W[2]-membership of other problems, not necessarily related to domination

exactly canceled through the next-to-next-to-leading-order renormalization of

the convergence of the relativistic expansion arising from the color-singlet

though the order-$v^4$ color-singlet short-distance coefficient is quite large,
the relativistic expansion for the color-singlet contributions in the process
$\Upsilon\to c\bar{c}+X$ is well convergent due to a small value of $v$. In
addition, we extrapolate the value of the mass ratio of the charm quark to the
bottom quark, and find the relativistic corrections rise quickly with increase

non-magnetic voids in the system. Studying the domain wall velocity as a
function of the applied field and current density reveals fundamental
differences in the domain wall dynamics induced by these two modes of driving:
For the field-driven case, we identify two different domain wall pinning
mechanisms, operating below and above the Walker breakdown, respectively,
whereas for the current-driven case pinning is absent above the Walker
breakdown. Increasing the disorder strength induces a larger Walker breakdown
field and current, and leads to decreased and increased domain wall velocities
at the breakdown field and current, respectively. Furthermore, for adiabatic
spin transfer torque, the intrinsic pinning mechanism is found to be suppressed
by disorder. We explain these findings within the one-dimensional model in
terms of an effective damping parameter $\alpha^*$ increasing with the disorder
strength.

have per- formed a survey of obvious and persistent (without significant
damping) Doppler shift oscillations in the corona. We have found mainly two
types of oscillations from February to April in 2007. One type is found at loop
footpoint regions, with a dominant period around 10 minutes. They are
characterized by coherent behavior of all line parameters (line intensity,
Doppler shift, line width and profile asymmetry), apparent blue shift and
blueward asymmetry throughout almost the en- tire duration. Such oscillations
are likely to be signatures of quasi-periodic upflows (small-scale jets, or
coronal counterpart of type-II spicules), which may play an important role in
the supply of mass and energy to the hot corona. The other type of oscillation
is usually associated with the upper part of loops. They are most clearly seen
in the Doppler shift of coronal lines with forma- tion temperatures between one
and two million degrees. The global wavelets of these oscillations usually peak
sharply around a period in the range of 3-6 minutes. No obvious profile
asymmetry is found and the variation of the line width is typically very small.
The intensity variation is often less than 2%. These oscillations are more
likely to be signatures of kink/Alfven waves rather than flows. In a few cases
there seems to be a pi/2 phase shift between the intensity and Doppler shift
oscillations, which may suggest the presence of slow mode standing waves
according to wave theories. However, we demonstrate that such a phase shift
could also be produced by loops moving into and out of a spatial pixel as a
result of Alfvenic oscillations. In this scenario, the intensity oscillations
associated with Alfvenic waves are caused by loop displacement rather than
density change.

A T_eff of 8940K for the white dwarf is consistent with a cooling age >2 Gyr,

material being generated by the destruction of small rocky bodies that are

positive behavior is due to attractive long-range interactions mediated by a
bosonic field to which the memory is coupled. The crucial ingredients for the
implementation of such a memory are the physical realization of the bosonic
field as well as local five-body interactions between the stabilizer operators
of the memory and the bosonic field. Here, we show that both of these
ingredients appear in a low-energy effective theory of a Hamiltonian that
involves only two-body interactions between neighboring spins. In particular,
we consider the low-energy, long-wavelength excitations of an ordered
Heisenberg ferromagnet (magnons) as a realization of the bosonic field.
Furthermore, we present perturbative gadgets for generating the required
five-spin operators. Our Hamiltonian involving only local two-body interactions
is thus expected to exhibit self-correcting properties as long as the noise
affecting it is in the regime where the effective low-energy description
remains valid.

photometric bands without being visible in the Spitzer map at 24 $\mu$m. B1-bN
is clearly detected between 100 $\mu$m and 250 $\mu$m. We have fitted the
spectral energy distributions of these sources to derive their physical
properties, and find that a simple greybody model fails to reproduce the
observed SEDs. At least a two-component model, consisting of a central source
surrounded by a dusty envelope is required. The properties derived from the
fit, however, suggest that the central source is not a Class 0 object. We then
conclude that while B1-bS and B1-bN appear to be more evolved than a
pre-stellar core, the best-fit models suggest that their central objects are
younger than a Class 0 source. Hence, they may be good candidates to be
examples of the first hydrostatic core phase. The projected distance between
B1-bS and B1-bN is a few Jeans lengths. If their physical separation is close
to this value, this pair would allow the mutual interactions between two
forming stars at a very early stage of their evolution to be studied.

interconnected network of long elastic filaments. The connections between the
filaments are provided by crosslinking proteins, which constitute, next to the
filaments, the second important mechanical element of the network. An important
aspect of cytoskeletal assemblies is their dynamic nature, which allows
remodeling in response to external cues. The reversible nature of crosslink
binding is an important mechanism that underlies these dynamical processes.
Here, we develop a theoretical model that provides insight into how the
mechanical properties of cytoskeletal networks may depend on their underlying
constituting elements. We incorporate three important ingredients: nonaffine
filament deformations in response to network strain; interplay between filament
and crosslink mechanical properties; reversible crosslink (un)binding in
response to imposed stress. With this we are able to self-consistently
calculate the nonlinear modulus of the network as a function of deformation
amplitude and crosslink as well as filament stiffnesses. During loading
crosslink unbinding processes lead to a relaxation of stress and therefore to a
reduction of the network modulus and eventually to network failure, when all
crosslink are unbound. This softening due to crosslink unbinding generically
competes with an inherent stiffening response, which may either be due to
filament or crosslink nonlinear elasticity.

matter from high-precision two- and three-body forces derived within the
framework of chiral effective field theory. The contributions from two-nucleon
forces are computed in many-body perturbation theory to first and second order
(without any simplifying approximations). In addition we include the
leading-order one-loop diagrams from the N2LO chiral three-nucleon force, which
contribute to all Fermi liquid parameters except those associated with the
center-of-mass tensor interaction. The relative-momentum dependence of the
quasiparticle interaction is expanded in Legendre polynomials up to L=2.
Second-order Pauli blocking and medium polarization effects act coherently in
specific channels, namely for the Landau parameters f_1, h_0 and g_0, which
results in a dramatic increase in the quasiparticle effective mass as well as a
decrease in both the effective tensor force and the neutron matter spin
susceptibility. For densities greater than about half nuclear matter saturation
density \rho_0, the contributions to the Fermi liquid parameters from the
leading-order chiral three-nucleon force scale in all cases approximately
linearly with the nucleon density. The largest effect of the three-nucleon
force is to generate a strongly repulsive effective interaction in the
isotropic spin-independent channel. We show that the leading-order chiral
three-nucleon force leads to an increase in the spin susceptibility of neutron
matter, but we observe no evidence for a ferromagnetic spin instability in the
vicinity of the saturation density \rho_0. This work sets the foundation for
future studies of neutron matter response to weak and electromagnetic probes

show that high resolution x-ray diffraction is a convenient approach for the
characterization of such structures, allowing us to obtain in a nondestructive
fashion information such as the average domain period, the domain wall
inclination, and the overall structure quality.

subject of considerable research activity in recent years. These studies are
still somewhat fragmentary, focusing on numerical computations on particular
states of systems such as Helium, or on analytical studies of model-systems
such as the Moshinsky atom. Some general trends are beginning to emerge from
these studies: the amount of entanglement tends to increase with energy and, in
the case of excited states, entanglement does not necessarily tend to zero in
the limit of vanishing interaction between the two constituting particles. A
physical explanation of these properties, shared by the different two-electrons
models investigated so far, is still lacking. As a first step towards this goal
we perform here, via a perturbative approach, an analysis of entanglement in
two-electrons models that sheds new light on the physical origin of the
aforementioned features and on their universal character.

linear perturbation theory we describe the evolution of the mode amplitude and
follow the trajectory of a newborn neutron star through its instability window.
The influence on the f-mode instability of the magnetic field and the presence
of an unstable r-mode is also considered. Two different configurations are
studied in more detail; an N = 1 polytrope with a typical mass and radius and a
more massive polytropic N = 0.62 model with gravitational mass M = 1.98 Msun.
We study several evolutions with different initial rotation rates and
temperature and determine the gravitational waves radiated during the
instability. In more massive models, an unstable f-mode with a saturation
energy of about 1e-6 Msun c^2 may generate a gravitational-wave signal which
can be detected by the Advanced LIGO/Virgo detector from the Virgo cluster. The
magnetic field affects the evolution and then the detectability of the
gravitational radiation when its strength is higher than 1e12 G, while the
effects of an unstable r-mode become dominant when this mode reaches the
maximum saturation value allowed by non-linear mode couplings. However, the
relative saturation amplitude of the f- and r-modes must be known more
accurately in order to provide a definitive answer to this issue. From the
thermal evolution we find also that the heat generated by shear viscosity
during the saturation phase completely balances the neutrinos' cooling and
prevents the star from entering the regime of mutual friction. The evolution
time of the instability is therefore longer and the star loses significantly
larger amounts of angular momentum via gravitational waves.

states, so-called fractional Chern insulators (FCIs), in nearly flat
topological (Chern) bands has attracted a lot of recent interest. Here, we make
the connection between Abelian as well as non-Abelian FQH states and FCIs more
precise. Using a gauge-fixed version of Qi's Wannier basis representation of a
Chern band, we demonstrate that the interpolation between several FCI states,
obtained by short-range lattice interactions in a spin-orbit-coupled kagome
lattice model, and the corresponding continuum FQH states is smooth: the gap
remains approximately constant and extrapolates to a finite value in the
thermodynamic limit, while the low-lying part of the orbital entanglement
spectrum remains qualitatively unaltered. The orbital entanglement spectra also
provide a first glimpse of the edge physics of FCIs via the bulk-boundary
correspondence. Corroborating these results, we find that the squared overlaps
between the FCI and FQH ground states are as large as 98.7% for the 8-electron
Laughlin state at $\nu=1/3$ (consistent with an earlier study) and 97.8% for
the 10-electron Moore-Read state at $\nu=1/2$. For the bosonic analogs of these
states, the adiabatic continuity is also shown to hold, albeit with somewhat
smaller associated overlaps, etc. Although going between the Chern bands to the
Landau level problem is often smooth, we show that this is not always the case
by considering fermions at filling fraction $\nu=4/5$, where the interpolation
between Hamiltonians describing the two systems results in a phase transition.
