Secondly, we show how to obtain explicit first-order expansions of the

matrix-based and tensor-based Standard ESPRIT and Unitary ESPRIT. Thirdly, we
derive closed-form expressions for the mean square error (MSE) and show that
they only depend on the second-order moments of the noise. Hence, we only need
the noise to be zero mean and possess finite second order moments. Fourthly, we
investigate the effect of using Structured Least Squares (SLS) to solve the
overdetermined shift invariance equations in ESPRIT and provide an explicit
first-order expansion as well as a closed-form MSE expression. Finally, we
simplify the MSE for the special case of a single source and compute the
asymptotic efficiency of the investigated ESPRIT-type algorithms in compact

SNR. Our results are more general than existing results on the performance
analysis of ESPRIT-type algorithms since (a) we do not need any assumptions
about the noise except for the mean to be zero and the second-order moments to
be finite (in contrast to earlier results that require Gaussianity or
second-order circular symmetry); (b) our results are asymptotic in the

nanoparticle heterodimer comprised of a closely spaced semiconductor quantum
dot and metal nanoparticle. The bistable nature of the response results from
the interplay between the quantum dot's optical nonlinearity and its
self-action (feedback) originating from the presence of the metal nanoparticle.
We show that the feedback is governed by a complex valued coupling parameter
$G$. Both the real and imaginary parts of $G$ ($G_\mathrm{R}$ and
$G_\mathrm{I}$) play an important role in the occurrence of bistability, which
is manifested in an S-shaped dependence of the quantum dot excited state
population on the intensity of the external field, and hysteresis of the
population. From our calculations, we find that at $G_\mathrm{R} = 0$, the
critical value for bistability to occur is $G_\mathrm{I} = 8\Gamma$, whereas at
$G_\mathrm{I} = 0$, the critical value of $G_\mathrm{R} = 4\Gamma$, where
$\Gamma$ is the polarization dephasing rate. Thus, there exist two different
(limiting) mechanisms of bistability, depending on whether $G_\mathrm{R}$ is
much larger or much smaller than $G_\mathrm{I}$. We also calculate the
bistability phase diagram within the system's parameter space: spanned by
$G_\mathrm{R}$, $G_\mathrm{I}$ and $\Delta$, the latter being the detuning
between the driving frequency and the transition frequency of the quantum dot.
Additionally, switching times from the lower stable branch to the upper one
(and {\it vise versa}) are calculated as a function of the intensity of the
driving field. We show that the conditions for bistability to occur can be
realized, for example, for a heterodimer comprised of a closely spaced CdSe (or
CdSe/ZnSe) quantum dot and a gold nanosphere.

associated with an approximate conformal symmetry that has been spontaneously
broken. We focus on dilatons that arise from theories of technicolor, or from
theories of the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB), that involve
strong conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet. In the pNGB case, we are
considering a framework where the Higgs particle is significantly heavier than
the dilaton and has therefore not yet been observed. In each of the technicolor
and pNGB scenarios, we study both the case when the SM fermions and gauge
bosons are elementary, and the case when they are composites of the strongly
interacting sector. Our analysis incorporates conformal symmetry violating
effects, which are necessarily present since the dilaton is not massless, and
is directly applicable to a broad class of models that stabilize the weak scale
and involve strong conformal dynamics. Since the AdS/CFT correspondence relates
the radion in Randall-Sundrum (RS) models to the dilaton, our results also
apply to RS models with the SM fields localized on the infrared brane, or in
the bulk. We identify the parameters that can be used to distinguish the
dilatons associated with the several different classes of theories being
considered from each other, and from the SM Higgs. We perform a fit to all the
available data from several experiments and highlight the key observations to
extract these parameters. We find that at present, both the technicolor and
pNGB dilaton scenarios provide a good fit to the data, comparable to the SM
Higgs. We indicate the future observations that will help to corroborate or
falsify each scenario.

cell membrane, Escherichia coli glycerol uptake facilitator (GlpF) is the most
thoroughly studied. However, one question remains: Does glycerol modulate water
permeation? This study answers this fundamental question by determining the
chemical-potential profile of glycerol along the permeation path through GlpF's
conducting pore. There is a deep well near the Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motifs
(dissociation constant 14 microM) and a barrier near the selectivity filter
(10.1 kcal/mol above the well bottom). This profile owes its existence to
GlpF's perfect steric arrangement: The glycerol-protein van der Waals
interactions are attractive near the NPA but repulsive elsewhere in the
conducting pore. In light of the single-file nature of waters and glycerols
lining up in GlpF's amphipathic pore, it leads to the following conclusion:
Glycerol modulates water permeation in the microM range. At mM concentrations,
GlpF is glycerol-saturated and a glycerol dwelling in the well occludes the
conducting pore. Therefore, water permeation is fully correlated to glycerol
dissociation that has an Arrhenius activation barrier of 6.5 kcal/mol.
Validation of this theory is based on the existent in vitro data, some of which
have not been given the proper attention they deserved: The Arrhenius
activation barriers were found to be 7 kcal/mol for water permeation and 9.6
kcal/mol for glycerol permeation; The presence of up to 100 mM glycerol did not
affect the kinetics of water transport with very low permeability, in apparent
contradiction with the existent theories that predicted high permeability (0 M
glycerol).

previous estimate of spin obtained using the continuum-fitting method. At 99

modelling the relativistically broadened reflection, we also model a sharp and
prominent reflection component that provides strong evidence for substantial
reprocessing in the wind of the massive companion. We infer that this wind

  We look for young stars clumps that might plausibly be associated with spiral
structure. Wide-field UBVI photometry combined with infrared information allows
us to reconstruct the distribution in reddening and distance of young stars in
the field using the Color-Color and Color-Magnitude diagrams.
  The analysis of our data, combined too with extensive spectroscopy taken from
literature shows that the real entity of Trumpler 27 as an open cluster is far
from being firmly stated. In fact, instead of finding a relatively compact
group of stars confined to a small distance range, we found that stars
associated to Trumpler 27 are, indeed, a superposition of early type stars seen
along the line of sight extending over several kiloparsecs beyond even the
center of the galaxy. We demonstrate that at each distance range it becomes
possible to generate a color-magnitude diagram resembling that of an open
cluster. This way, our analysis indicates that what was considered an open
cluster characterized by a significant age spread is a stellar continuum that
reaches its maximum number of stars at approximately 3.5 kpc from the Sun, the
distance of the Scutum-Crux arm approximately. At the same time, and after
analyzing the way early type stars distribute with distance, we found some of
these stellar groups may be linked, within the distance errors, with other
inner spiral arms of our galaxy, including the Near 3 kpc arm at approximately
5 kpc from the Sun. However, very young stars by themselves do not seem to
trace strongly the inner spiral arms since they are distributed evenly across
several kiloparsecs toward the center of the Galaxy.

have been proposed in the reversible logic synthesis literature by considering
different libraries whose gates are associated to the generating sets of
certain Cayley graphs. In a Cayley graph, the distance between two vertices
corresponds to the optimal circuit size. The lower bound for the diameter of
Cayley graphs is also a lower bound for the worst case for any algorithm that
uses the corresponding gate library. In this paper, we study two Cayley graphs
on the Symmetric Group $S_{2^n}$: the first, denoted by $I_n$, is defined by a
generating set associated to generalized Toffoli gates; and the second, the
hypercube Cayley graph $H_n$, is defined by a generating set associated to
multiple-control Toffoli gates. Those two Cayley graphs have degree $n2^{n-1}$
and order $2^n!$. Maslov, Dueck and Miller proposed a reversible circuit
synthesis that we model by the Cayley graph $I_n$. We propose a synthesis
algorithm based on the Cayley graph $H_n$ with upper bound of $(n-1)2^{n}+1$

important property of natural scenes that makes inference of the full

occlusion and low-level image statistics has been hotly debated in the
literature, and extensive simulations have been used to determine whether
occlusion is responsible for the ubiquitously observed power-law power spectra
of natural images. To deepen our understanding of this problem, we have
analytically computed the 2- and 4-point functions of a generalized ""dead

Surprisingly, transparency alters these functions only by a multiplicative
constant, so long as object diameters follow a power law distribution. For
other object size distributions, transparency more substantially affects the
low-level image statistics. We propose that the universality of power law power
spectra for both natural scenes and radiological medical images -- formed by
the transmission of x-rays through partially transparent tissue -- stems from
power law object size distributions, independent of object opacity.

  Gradient",,,"10.1103/PhysRevE.87.042604",,"cond-mat.soft physics.bio-ph physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The translocation of a polymer through a pore in a membrane separating fluids
of different viscosities is studied via several computational approaches.
Starting with the polymer halfway, we find that as a viscosity difference
across the pore is introduced, translocation will predominately occur towards
one side of the membrane. These results suggest an intrinsic pumping mechanism
for translocation across cell walls which could arise whenever the fluid across
the membrane is inhomogeneous. Somewhat surprisingly, the sign of the preferred
direction of translocation is found to be strongly dependent on the simulation
algorithm: for Langevin Dynamics (LD) simulations, a bias towards the low
viscosity side is found while for Brownian Dynamics (BD), a bias towards the
high viscosity is found. Examining the translocation dynamics in detail across
a wide range of viscosity gradients and developing a simple force model to
estimate the magnitude of the bias, the LD results are demonstrated to be more
physically realistic. The LD results are also compared to those generated from
a simple, one dimensional random walk model of translocation to investigate the
role of the internal degrees of freedom of the polymer and the entropic
barrier. To conclude, the scaling of the results across different polymer
lengths demonstrates the saturation of the preferential direction with polymer
length and the non-trivial location of the maximum in the exponent
corresponding to the scaling of the translocation time with polymer length.

realized in an isolated 2D system with time-reversal symmetry, but rather owes
its existence to the topological properties of the 3D bulk wavefunctions. The
transport properties of such a surface state are of considerable current
interest; they have some similarities with graphene, which also realizes Dirac
fermions, but have several unique features in their response to magnetic
fields. In this review we give an overview of some of the main quantum
transport properties of topological insulator surfaces. We focus on the efforts
to use quantum interference phenomena, such as weak anti-localization and the
Aharonov-Bohm effect, to verify in a transport experiment the Dirac nature of
the surface state and its defining properties. In addition to explaining the

The neutrons were observed in forward detectors covering an angular range of up
to 2.2 mrad. We report results for neutrons with momentum fraction of x_F=0.45
to 1.0. The energy dependence of the measured cross sections were consistent
with x_F scaling, compared to measurements by an ISR experiment which measured
neutron production in unpolarized p+p collisions at sqrt(s)=30.6--62.7 GeV. The
cross sections for large x_F neutron production for p+p collisions, as well as
those in e+p collisions measured at HERA, are described by a pion exchange
mechanism. The observed forward neutron asymmetries were large, reaching
A_N=-0.08+/-0.02 for x_F=0.8; the measured backward asymmetries, for negative
x_F, were consistent with zero. The observed asymmetry for forward neutron
production is discussed within the pion exchange framework, with interference
between the spin-flip amplitude due to the pion exchange and nonflip amplitudes
from all Reggeon exchanges. Within the pion exchange description, the measured
neutron asymmetry is sensitive to the contribution of other Reggeon exchanges
even for small amplitudes.

energy-level shift near a medium whose conductivity in the direction parallel
to the surface far exceeds that in the direction perpendicular to the surface.
We investigate the influence of the anisotropy of the material's

robust metallic surface states protected by the topological properties of the
bulk wavefunctions. A quantum phase transition (QPT) from a TI to a
conventional insulator and a change in topological class can only occur when
the bulk band gap closes. In this work, we have utilized time-domain terahertz
spectroscopy (TDTS) to investigate the low frequency conductance in
(Bi$_{1-x}$In$_x$)$_2$Se$_3$ as we tune through this transition by indium
substitution. Above certain substitution levels we observe a collapse in the
transport lifetime that indicates the destruction of the topological phase. We
associate this effect with the threshold where states from opposite surfaces
hybridize. The substitution level of the threshold is thickness dependent and
only asymptotically approaches the bulk limit $x \approx 0.06$ where a maximum
in the mid-infrared absorption is exhibited. This absorption can be identified
with the bulk band gap closing and a change in topological class. The
correlation length associated with the QPT appears as the evanescent length of
the surface states. The observation of the thickness-dependent collapse of the
transport lifetime shows the unusual role that finite size effects play in this
topological QPT.

realistic experimental parameters, we quantify the density fluctuations and
phase coherence of the atomic field as functions of the system temperature. We
identify the onset of Bose condensation through analysis of both the
generalized Binder cumulant appropriate to the inhomogeneous system, and the
suppression of the effective many-body T matrix that characterizes interactions
between condensate atoms in the finite-temperature field. We find that the
system undergoes a second-order transition to condensation near the critical
temperature for an ideal Bose gas in the strongly anisotropic three-dimensional

by inflationary models that include particle production during inflation,
e.g.trapped inflation, grazing ESP encounters or modulated trapping, among
others. While de-phasing of inflatons tends to suppress parametric resonance,
we find two new effects leading to efficient preheating: particle production
during the first in-fall (efficient if many preheat matter fields are present)
and a subsequent (narrow) resonance phase (efficient if an ESP happens to be at
one of several distinct distances from the inflatons' VEV). Particles produced
during the first in-fall are comprised of many species with low occupation

radically changed our view on baryons, indicating AGN heating as the balancing
counterpart of cooling. This work reviews our extensive investigation on
self-regulated heating. We argue that the mechanical feedback, based on massive
subrelativistic outflows, is the key to solving the cooling flow problem, i.e.
dramatically quenching the cooling rates for several Gyr without destroying the
cool-core structure. Using a modified version of the 3D hydrocode FLASH, we
show that bipolar AGN outflows can further reproduce fundamental observed
features, such as buoyant bubbles, weak shocks, metals dredge- up, and
turbulence. The latter is an essential ingredient to drive nonlinear thermal
instabilities, which cause the formation of extended cold gas, a residual of
the quenched cooling flow and, later, fuel for the feedback engine. Compared to
clusters, groups and galaxies require a gentler mechanical feedback, in order
to avoid catastrophic overheating. We highlight the essential characteristics
for a realistic AGN feedback, with emphasis on observational consistency.

convincing physical explanation. We use a volume-limited sample of galaxies
with redshifts less than 0.03 drawn from the SDSS DR7 to investigate the scale
dependence of the effect and how it changes as a function of the mass of the
central galaxy. Conformity extends over a central galaxy stellar mass range
spanning two orders of magnitude. In central galaxies with masses less than
10^10 M_sun, conformity extends out to scales in excess of 4 Mpc, well beyond
the virial radii of their dark matter halos. For low mass central galaxies,
large-scale conformity with neighbours is only seen when the centrals have low
star formation rate or gas content. In contrast, at high stellar masses,
conformity with neighbours applies in the gas-rich regime and is clearly
confined to scales comparable to the virial radius of the dark matter halo of
the central galaxy. Our analysis of a mock catalogue from the Guo et al (2011)
models shows that conformity-like effects are much weaker than observed, and
apply only to the low SFR/M* tail of neighbouring galaxies. In the models, the
median and the upper percentiles of the SFR/M* distribution remain almost
unchanged, which is in contradiction with the data. Conformity between
low-mass, gas-poor central galaxies and their distant neighbours cannot be
explained within the framework of halo occupation distribution (HOD) models. It
is likely a signature of pre-heating of the intergalactic gas at an earlier
epoch. The smaller-scale conformity between high-mass, gas-rich central
galaxies and their close neighbours may be a signature of ongoing gas accretion
onto central galaxies in a minority of massive dark matter halos.

ability of that node to gain more links in the future. We study network growth
where nodes attach proportionally to the clustering coefficients, or local

the impact of the formation history on the density profiles of the halos. We
find that the deviations from the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model and the

considerable deviations from both models, partly due to the presence of massive
subhalos, while early-forming halos deviate less but still significantly from
the NFW model and are better described by the Einasto model. We find that the
halo shapes depend only moderately on formation time. Departure from spherical
symmetry impacts the density profiles through the anisotropic distribution of
massive subhalos. Further evidence of the impact of subhalos is provided by
analyzing the phase-space structure. A detailed analysis of the properties of

high-dimensional signals with sparse or low-rank structure can be effectively
projected into a low-dimensional space (for efficient acquisition or
processing) when the projection operator achieves a stable embedding of the
data by satisfying the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). It has also been
shown that such stable embeddings can be achieved for general Riemannian
submanifolds when random orthoprojectors are used for dimensionality reduction.
Due to computational costs and system constraints, the CS community has
recently explored the RIP for structured random matrices (e.g., random
convolutions, localized measurements, deterministic constructions). The main
contribution of this paper is to show that any matrix satisfying the RIP (i.e.,
providing a stable embedding for sparse signals) can be used to construct a
stable embedding for manifold-modeled signals by randomizing the column signs
and paying reasonable additional factors in the number of measurements. We
demonstrate this result with several new constructions for stable manifold
embeddings using structured matrices. This result allows advances in efficient

propagation condition is satisfied. Elements receiving the propagated waves
become part of the wavefront. This pattern results in irregular data accesses
and computations. We develop and evaluate strategies for efficient computation
and propagation of wavefronts using a multi-level queue structure. This queue
structure improves the utilization of fast memories in a GPU and reduces
synchronization overheads. We also develop a tile-based parallelization
strategy to support execution on multiple CPUs and GPUs. We evaluate our
approaches on a state-of-the-art GPU accelerated machine (equipped with 3 GPUs
and 2 multicore CPUs) using the IWPP implementations of two widely used image

solve the corresponding optimization problems, we propose an algorithm that is

star-forming galaxies, active galactic nuclei and quasars play in contributing
to the metagalactic ionizing background across cosmic time remains uncertain.
Deep quasar counts provide insights into their role, but the potentially
crucial contribution from star-formation is highly uncertain due to our poor
understanding of the processes that allow ionizing radiation to escape into the
intergalactic medium (IGM). The fraction of ionizing photons that escape from
star-forming galaxies is a fundamental free parameter used in models to
""fine-tune"" the timing and duration of the reionization epoch that occurred
somewhere between 13.4 and 12.7 Gyrs ago (redshifts between 12 > z > 6).
However, direct observation of Lyman continuum (LyC) photons emitted below the
rest frame \ion{H}{1} ionization edge at 912 \AA\ is increasingly improbable at
redshifts z > 3, due to the steady increase of intervening Lyman limit systems
towards high z. Thus UV and U-band optical bandpasses provide the only hope for
direct, up close and in depth, observations of the types of environment that
favor LyC escape. By quantifying the evolution over the past 11 billion years
(z < 3) of the relationships between LyC escape and local and global parameters
..., we can provide definitive information on the LyC escape fraction that is
so crucial to answering the question of, how did the universe come to be
ionized? Here we provide estimates of the ionizing continuum flux emitted by
""characteristic"" (L_{uv}^*) star-forming galaxies as a function of look back
time and escape fraction, finding that at z = 1 (7.6 Gyrs ago) L_{uv}^*

implications for the evolution of cooperation, social cognition, and
predator-prey dynamics. An important goal of these studies is discerning which
evolutionary pressures favor the formation of swarms. One hypothesis is that
swarms arise because the presence of multiple moving prey in swarms causes
confusion for attacking predators, but it remains unclear how important this
selective force is. Using an evolutionary model of a predator-prey system, we
show that predator confusion provides a sufficient selection pressure to evolve
swarming behavior in prey. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the evolutionary
effect of predator confusion on prey could in turn exert pressure on the
structure of the predator's visual field, favoring the frontally oriented,
high-resolution visual systems commonly observed in predators that feed on
swarming animals. Finally, we provide evidence that when prey evolve swarming
in response to predator confusion, there is a change in the shape of the
functional response curve describing the predator's consumption rate as prey
density increases. Thus, we show that a relatively simple perceptual
constraint--predator confusion--could have pervasive evolutionary effects on
prey behavior, predator sensory mechanisms, and the ecological interactions
between predators and prey.

according to channel variation is often used to deal with time-varying nature
of wireless channel. When channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT)
is delayed by more than channel coherence time due to feedback delay, however,
the effect of link adaptation can possibly be taken away if this delay is not
taken into account. One way to deal with such delay is to predict current
channel quality given available observation, but this would inevitably result
in prediction error. In this paper, an algorithm with different view point is
proposed. By using conditional cdf of current channel given observation, outage
probability can be computed for each value of transmission rate $R$. By
assuming that the transmission block error rate (BLER) is dominated by outage
probability, the expected throughput can also be computed, and $R$ can be
determined to maximize it. The proposed scheme is designed to be optimal if

support high-throughput execution on hybrid cluster machines of large-scale
analysis applications. A hybrid cluster machine consists of computation nodes

Our work targets scientific analysis applications in which datasets are
processed in application-specific data chunks, and the processing of a data
chunk is expressed as a hierarchical pipeline of operations. The proposed
middleware system combines a bag-of-tasks style execution with coarse-grain
dataflow execution. Data chunks and associated data processing pipelines are
scheduled across cluster nodes using a demand driven approach, while within a
node operations in a given pipeline instance are scheduled across CPUs and
GPUs. The runtime system implements several optimizations, including
performance aware task scheduling, architecture aware process placement, data
locality conscious task assignment, and data prefetching and asynchronous data
copy, to maximize utilization of the aggregate computing power of CPUs and GPUs
and minimize data copy overheads. The application and performance benefits of
the runtime middleware are demonstrated using an image analysis application,
which is employed in a brain cancer study, on a state-of-the-art hybrid cluster
in which each node has two 6-core CPUs and three GPUs. Our results show that
implementing and scheduling application data processing as a set of fine-grain
operations provide more opportunities for runtime optimizations and attain
better performance than a coarser-grain, monolithic implementation. The
proposed runtime system can achieve high-throughput processing of large
datasets - we were able to process an image dataset consisting of 36,848
4Kx4K-pixel image tiles at about 150 tiles/second rate on 100 nodes.

time series of red giants. We are now able to probe the rotational behaviour in

the rotational splittings in red giants and to derive scaling relations for
rotation related to seismic and fundamental stellar parameters. We have
developed a dedicated method for automated measurements of the rotational
splittings in a large number of red giants. Ensemble asteroseismology, namely
the examination of a large number of red giants at different stages of their
evolution, allows us to derive global information on stellar evolution. We have
measured rotational splittings in a sample of about 300 red giants. We have
also shown that these splittings are dominated by the core rotation. Under the
assumption that a linear analysis can provide the rotational splitting, we
observe a small increase of the core rotation of stars ascending the red giant
branch. Alternatively, an important slow down is observed for red-clump stars
compared to the red giant branch. We also show that, at fixed stellar radius,
the specific angular momentum increases with increasing stellar mass. Ensemble
asteroseismology indicates what has been indirectly suspected for a while: our
interpretation of the observed rotational splittings leads to the conclusion
that the mean core rotation significantly slows down during the red giant
phase. The slow-down occurs in the last stages of the red giant branch. This
spinning down explains, for instance, the long rotation periods measured in
white dwarfs

the Universe's missing matter. The count rate in these experiments should
experience an annual modulation due to the relative motion of the Earth around
the Sun. This modulation, not present for most known background sources, is
critical for solidifying the origin of a potential signal as dark matter. In
this article, we review the physics of annual modulation, discussing the
practical formulae needed to interpret a modulating signal. We focus on how the
modulation spectrum changes depending on the particle and astrophysics models
for the dark matter. For standard assumptions, the count rate has a cosine
dependence with time, with a maximum in June and a minimum in December.
Well-motivated generalizations of these models, however, can affect both the
phase and amplitude of the modulation. We show how a measurement of an annually
modulating signal could teach us about the presence of substructure in the
Galactic halo or about the interactions between dark and baryonic matter.
Although primarily a theoretical review, we briefly discuss the current
experimental situation for annual modulation and future experimental
directions.

Currently there are several phenomenological models, based on very distinct
approaches, which describe the scarce experimental data quite successfully. One
of main uncertainties comes from the schemes used to include the effects
associated to the multiple scatterings and to unitarize the cross section. In
this paper we compare the predictions of three different unitarization schemes
of the nuclear structure function which use the same theoretical input to
describe the projectile-nucleon interaction. In particular, we consider as
input the predictions of the Color Glass Condensate formalism, which reproduce
the inclusive and diffractive $ep$ HERA data. Our results suggest that the
experimental analysis of $F_2^A$ will be able to discriminate between the
unitarization schemes.

rates over reliable communication. Hybrid automatic-repeat-request (ARQ) is one
of the techniques to make such improvement possible. However, this advancement
is reduced at the cell edge where interference is not negligible. In order to
overcome the challenge at the cell edge, the concept of interference-aware
receiver has been recently proposed in which both desired and interference
signals are successively decoded, called interference-aware successive decoding
(IASD). Although IASD is the advanced receiver technology, interference signals
are out of the mobile station's control so that they cannot be requested by the
mobile station. For this reason, this paper proposes new combining schemes for
the IASD receiver, which operate with hybrid ARQ in a bit level or in a symbol
level. In addition, this paper compares the memory requirement among the
proposed combining schemes and analyzes the impact of discrete modulation on
the proposed scheme. Simulation results presents the superiority of the
proposed combining schemes and shows the improvement in terms of the number of

density and size $\rho\propto R^{-1}$, which in turn implies that mass

the observational methods used. Specifically, setting the column density
threshold near or above the peak of the column density probability distribution
function Npdf ($N\sim 10^{21}$ cm\alamenos 2) produces the Larson scaling as
long as the Npdf decreases rapidly at higher column densities. We argue that
the physical reasons behind local clouds to have this behavior are that (1)
this peak column density is near the value required to shield CO from
photodissociation in the solar neighborhood, and (2) gas at higher column
densities is rare because it is susceptible to gravitational collapse into much
smaller structures in specific small regions of the cloud. Similarly, we also
use previous results to show that if instead a threshold is set for the volume
density, the density will appear to be constant, implying thus that $M \propto
R^3$. Thus, the Larson scaling relation does not provide much information on
the structure of molecular clouds, and does not imply either that clouds are in
Virial equilibrium, or have a universal structure. We also show that the slope
of the $M-R$ curve for a single cloud, which transitions from near-to-flat
values for large radii to $\alpha=2$ as a limiting case for small radii,
depends on the properties of the Npdf.

in the economics community, but it is attracted little attention in the physics
community. The TD game is a two-person game. Each player can select an integer
value between $R$ and $M$ ($R < M$) as a pure strategy. If both of them select
the same value, the payoff to them will be that value. If the players select
different values, say $i$ and $j$ ($R \le i < j \le M$), then the payoff to the
player who chooses the small value will be $i+R$ and the payoff to the other
player will be $i-R$. We term the player who selects a large value as the
cooperator, and the one who chooses a small value as the defector. The reason
is that if both of them select large values, it will result in a large total
payoff. The Nash equilibrium of the TD game is to choose the smallest value
$R$. However, in previous behavioral studies, players in TD game typically
select values that are much larger than $R$, and the average selected value
exhibits an inverse relationship with $R$. To explain such anomalous behavior,
in this paper, we study the evolution of cooperation in spatial traveler's
dilemma game where the players are located on a square lattice and each player
plays TD games with his neighbors. Players in our model can adopt their
neighbors' strategies following two standard models of spatial game dynamics.
Monte-Carlo simulation is applied to our model, and the results show that the
cooperation level of the system, which is proportional to the average value of
the strategies, decreases with increasing $R$ until $R$ is greater than the
threshold where cooperation vanishes. Our findings indicate that spatial
reciprocity promotes the evolution of cooperation in TD game and the spatial TD
game model can interpret the anomalous behavior observed in previous behavioral
experiments.

  Theorems","to appear in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The classical problem in network coding theory considers communication over
multicast networks. Multiple transmitters send independent messages to multiple
receivers which decode the same set of messages. In this work, computation over
multicast networks is considered: each receiver decodes an identical function
of the original messages. For a countably infinite class of two-transmitter
two-receiver single-hop linear deterministic networks, the computing capacity
is characterized for a linear function (modulo-2 sum) of Bernoulli sources.
Inspired by the geometric concept of interference alignment in networks, a new
achievable coding scheme called function alignment is introduced. A new
converse theorem is established that is tighter than cut-set based and
genie-aided bounds. Computation (vs. communication) over multicast networks
requires additional analysis to account for multiple receivers sharing a
network's computational resources. We also develop a network decomposition
theorem which identifies elementary parallel subnetworks that can constitute an
original network without loss of optimality. The decomposition theorem provides
a conceptually-simpler algebraic proof of achievability that generalizes to
$L$-transmitter $L$-receiver networks.

are systematically examined with particular focus on phenomena that originate
from the differences between Fermi surfaces split by a strong spin-orbit
coupling. In particular, when the spin-orbit coupling increases and one of the
split Fermi surfaces disappears, the phase diagram and the structure of the gap
function change drastically. For example, we examine the conditions for the
transition from full-gap states to line-node states (FLT), which may explain
the differences in the experimental results between the noncentrosymmetric
superconductors Li2Pd3B and Li2Pt3B discovered recently. The dominant pairing
interactions and gap functions can be predicted to some extent by comparing the
theoretical and experimental results for these compounds. For example, if the
FLT occurs by replacing Pd with Pt, it is most likely that the
superconductivity is mainly induced by charge-charge interactions, and if this
is the case, the superconductivities in Li2Pd3B and Li2Pt3B are an s-wave
nearly spin-triplet state and a d-wave state that has both spin-singlet and
triplet components of comparable weights, respectively. Comparing the
theoretical phase diagrams in simple models, it is found that the FLT occurs in
a wider realistic parameter region for charge-charge interactions, i.e., where
short-range Coulomb repulsion is strong and p-wave and d-wave interactions are
attractive, while it occurs in narrower rather unrealistic parameter regions
for interactions of magnetic origin. It is also found that d-wave spin-triplet
pairing may occur, when pairing interactions are of magnetic origin and
anisotropic in spin space.

devoted to the interplay between collective motions and internal degrees of
freedom. For instance, the harmonic nature of collective vibrations is
questioned. Nuclei are also known to exhibit superfluidity due to pairing
residual interaction. Extensions of the theoretical approach to study such
pairing vibrations are now available. Large amplitude collective motions are
investigated in the framework of heavy-ion collisions leading, for instance, to
the formation of a compound system. How fusion is affected by the internal
structure of the collision partners, such as their deformation, is discussed.
Other mechanisms in competition with fusion, and responsible for the formation
of fragments which differ from the entrance channel (transfer reactions,
deep-inelastic collisions, and quasi-fission) are investigated. Finally,
studies of actinide collisions forming, during very short times of few
zeptoseconds, the heaviest nuclear systems available on Earth, are presented.

reported in high-resolution observations. Two typical features of the
observations are that the oscillations are damped in time and that simultaneous
mass flows along the threads are detected. Flows cause the dense threads to
move along the prominence magnetic structure while the threads are oscillating.
The oscillations have been interpreted in terms of standing magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) kink waves of the magnetic flux tubes which support the threads. The
damping is most likely due to resonant absorption caused by plasma
inhomogeneity. The technique of seismology uses the observations combined with
MHD wave theory to estimate prominence physical parameters. This paper presents
a theoretical study of the joint effect of flow and resonant absorption on the
amplitude of standing kink waves in prominence threads. We find that flow and
resonant absorption can either be competing effects on the amplitude or both
can contribute to damp the oscillations depending on the instantaneous position
of the thread within the prominence magnetic structure. The amplitude profile
deviates from the classic exponential profile of resonantly damped kink waves
in static flux tubes. Flow also introduces a progressive shift of the
oscillation period compared to the static case, although this effect is in
general of minor importance. We test the robustness of seismological estimates
by using synthetic data aiming to mimic real observations. The effect of the
thread flow can significantly affect the estimation of the transverse
inhomogeneity length scale. The presence of random background noise adds
uncertainty to this estimation. Caution needs to be paid to the seismological
estimates that do not take the influence of flow into account.

background (CMB) radiation sourced from primordial cross-bispectra between

model where an inflaton and a vector field are coupled. In case the vector
field survives after the reheating, both the primordial scalar and tensor
fluctuations can be enhanced by the anisotropic stress composed of the vector
fields during radiation dominated era. We show that through this enhancement
the primordial cross-bispectra generate not only CMB bispectra but also CMB
power spectra. In general, we can expect such cross-bispectra produce the
non-trivial mode-coupling signals between the scalar and tensor fluctuations.
However, we explicitly show that such mode-coupling signals do not appear in
CMB power spectra. Through the numerical analysis of the CMB scalar-mode power
spectra, we find that although signals from these cross-bispectra are smaller
than primary non-electromagnetic ones, these have some characteristic features
such as negative auto-correlations of the temperature and polarization modes,
respectively. On the other hand, signals from tensor modes are almost
comparable to primary non-electromagnetic ones and hence the shape of observed
$B$-mode spectrum may deviate from the prediction in the non-electromagnetic
case. The above imprints may help us to judge the existence of the coupling
between the scalar and vector fields in the early Universe.

changes with time and passes through 0. The speed of this passage is of order
of $\varepsilon$. We provide asymptotic formulas that describe effects of
passage through a resonance with an accuracy $O(\varepsilon^{\frac32})$. This
is an improvement of known results by Chirikov (1959), Kevorkian (1971, 1974)

small, investors' asymmetric response to gains and losses leads to the
occurrence of herd behavior, when all the investors are prone to behave
similarly in an extreme way and large price fluctuations occur. A linear
relation between the standard deviation of stock price changes and the mean

self-segregate into opposing groups and the introduction of asymmetric
sensitivity leads to the disappearance of dominant strategies. Compared with
the situations in the stock market with little market impact, the stock price
fluctuations are suppressed and an efficient market occurs. Theoretical
analyses indicate that the mechanism of phase transition from clustering to
self-segregation in the present model is similar to that in the
majority-minority game and the occurrence and disappearance of efficient
markets are related to the competition between the trend-following and the

strain was predominately austenite transforming to {\epsilon}-martensite (Stage
I), but upon saturation of Stage I, the {\epsilon}-martensite transformed to

behavior with alloy rich regions producing TRIP just prior to necking. This
behavior was explained by first principle calculations that revealed aluminum
significantly affected the stacking fault energy in Fe-Mn-Al-C steels by
decreasing the unstable stacking fault energy and promoting easy nucleation of
{\epsilon}-martensite. The addition of aluminum also raised the intrinsic
stacking fault energy and caused the {\epsilon}-martensite to be unstable and
transform to {\alpha}-martensite under further deformation. The two stage TRIP

the coordinated activity of many brain areas. Prior work has identified many
behavioral, molecular biological and single neuron changes throughout the
mesocorticolimbic system that reflect and drive addictive behavior.
Subpopulations in the ventral tegemental area (VTA) encode positive reward
prediction error, negative reward prediction error, and the magnitude of the
reward. Phasic activity in VTA dopaminergic neurons correlates with hedonic
value. Tonic activity of groups in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC)
can encode antidepressant states. However, little is known about how drug
addiction might affect population encoding across larger brain regions. Here,
we compare the information content associated with network patterns in naive,
acutely intoxicated and chronically addicted states in a plastic attractor
network. We found that addiction decreases the network's ability to store and
discriminate among patterns of activity. Altered dopaminergic tone flattens the
energy landscape and decreases the entropy associated with each network
pattern. Altered dmPFC activity produces signal-to-noise deficits similar to
computational models of schizophrenia. Our results provide a conceptual
framework for interpreting altered neural population dynamics in
psychopathological states based on information theory. They also suggest a view
of the subtypes of depression as on a continuum of combinations of cortical and
subcortical dysfunction. This suggests that patients who suffer from depression
with psychotic features will have more cortical than mesolimbic dysfunction.
Furthermore, our framework can be applied to other psychiatric illnesses and so
may help us, in general, quantitatively understand psychiatric illnesses as
disorders in the representation and processing of information by distributed
brain networks.

OAM-independent Larmor rotation of a mode superposition inside the lens.
Second, hen passing through the focal plane, the electron beam acquires an
additional Gouy phase dependent on the absolute value of the OAM. This brings
about the Gouy rotation of the superposition image proportional to the sign of
the OAM. A combination of the Larmor and Gouy effects can result in the
addition (or subtraction) of rotations, depending on the OAM sign. This
behaviour is unique to electron vortex beams and has no optical counterpart, as

$R$-module. We intend to establish the dual of Grothendieck's Vanishing Theorem
for local homology modules. We conjecture that $H^{\fa}_i(M)=0$ for all
$i>\Mag_RM$. We prove this in several cases.

broadcast standards, we illustrate how doping mechanisms included in the design
of erasure coding and decoding may improve the scalability of the packet
throughput, decrease overall latency and potentially differentiate among
classes of multimedia subscribers regardless of their signal quality. We
describe decoding mechanisms that allow for linear complexity and give
complexity bounds when feedback is available. We show that elaborate coding
schemes which include pre-coding stages are inferior to simple Ideal Soliton
based rateless codes, combined with the proposed two-phase decoder. The
simplicity of this scheme and the availability of tight bounds on latency given
pre-allocated radio resources makes it a practical and efficient design
solution.

analysis shows that the observed oscillation may correspond to the fundamental
harmonic of standing kink waves.

solar wind acceleration. Recent observations by Hinode/SOT showed that the
spicules mostly exhibit upward propagating high frequency waves. Here we
investigate the dissipation of such waves due to phase mixing in stratified
environment of solar spicules. Since they are highly dynamic structures with
speeds at about significant fractions of the Alfven phase speed, we take into
account the effects of steady flows. Our numerical simulations show that in the
presence of stratification due to gravity, damping takes place in space than in
time. The exponential damping low, exp(-At^3), is valid under spicule
conditions, however the calculated damping time is much longer than the
reported spicule lifetimes from observations.
