to model the time evolution of the radius of a pre-critical molecular cluster
during nucleation (the classical order parameter). Such a stochastic
differential equation constitutes the basis for the calculation of the
(nucleation) induction time under Kramers' theory of thermally activated escape
processes. Considering the nucleation stage as a Poisson rare-event, analytical
expressions for the induction time statistics are deduced for both steady and
unsteady conditions, the latter assuming the semiadiabatic limit. These
expressions can be used to identify the underlying mechanism of molecular
cluster formation (distinguishing between homogeneous or heterogeneous
nucleation from the nucleation statistics is possible) as well as to predict
induction times and induction time distributions. The predictions of this model
are in good agreement with experimentally measured induction times at constant
temperature, unlike the values obtained from the classical equation, but
agreement is not so good for induction time statistics. Stochastic simulations
truncated to the maximum waiting time of the experiments confirm that this fact
is due to the time constraints imposed by experiments. Correcting for this
effect, the experimental and predicted curves fit remarkably well. Thus, the
proposed model seems to be a versatile tool to predict cluster size
distributions, nucleation rates, (nucleation) induction time and induction time
statistics for a wide range of conditions (e.g. time-dependent temperature,
supersaturation, pH, etc.) where classical nucleation theory is of limited
applicability.

Governance. In the globalized world the importance of Information Systems (IS)
and Information Technology (IT) become increasingly relevant regarding the
requirements imposed by competition. Both the knowledge of the business as the
rapid flow of information are fundamental for a enterprise decision making.
Whereas the basic definition of IT = hardware + software, i.e., tools that has
been used to create, store and disseminate data and information in the creation
of knowledge, and IS = IT + People + procedures that collect, process and
disseminate the information to support decision making, coordination, control,
analysis and visualization in the organization [01], it makes implicit the
understanding of IS is essential to create competitive companies, to manage
global corporations and provide customers with products and services of value.
In this work we are correlating IS with the governance of management of an
ecosystem. Yet, as IT is redefining the foundations of business, then the
customer service, operations, strategies of product marketing and its
distribution and even the knowledge management (KM) depends very much, or
sometimes even completely, on the IS. The IT and its costs have become a part
of day-to-day business [02]. In order to meet this complexity of business
needs, today is not possible to disregard the IT and its available resources,
which makes very dificult to draw up IS. Therefore, the perspective view of the
Sociotehcnical Aspects of an IS are directly concerned with governance and the
model proposed regarding an ecosystem. Finally, whereas the summary above, the
main objective of this opinion paper is to propose the guidelines for a
Sociotechnical Management Model of Governance for an Ecosystem.

and a 7.5-14.2 Msun WR companion. We find that the fate of such a binary leads
to the prompt (<1 Myr) formation of a close BH-BH system for the high end of
the allowed WR mass (M_WR>13 Msun). For the low- to mid-mass range of the WR
star (M_WR=7-10 Msun) Cyg X-3 is most likely (probability 70%) disrupted when
WR ends up as a supernova. However, with smaller probability, it may form a
wide (15%) or a close (15%) BH-NS system. The advanced LIGO/VIRGO detection
rate for mergers of BH-BH systems from the Cyg X-3 formation channel is 10 per
year, while it drops down to 0.1 per year for BH-NS systems. If Cyg X-3 in fact
hosts a low mass BH and massive WR star, it lends additional support for the
existence of BH-BH/BH-NS systems.

determine the rich quantum phase diagram of dipolar fermions at half-filling as
a function of the dipolar orientation, and discuss how these SDWs arise amidst

severe in deep submicron technology, and hence can greatly affect the overall
system performance. Based on a delay model proposed by Sotiriadis et al.,
transition patterns over a bus can be classified according to their delays.
Using this classification, crosstalk avoidance codes (CACs) have been proposed
to alleviate the crosstalk delays by restricting the transition patterns on a
bus. In this paper, we first propose a new classification of transition
patterns, and then devise a new family of CACs based on this classification. In
comparison to the previous classification, our classification has more classes
and the delays of its classes do not overlap, both leading to more accurate
control of delays. Our new family of CACs includes some previously proposed
codes as well as new codes with reduced delays and improved throughput. Thus,
this new family of crosstalk avoidance codes provides a wider variety of
tradeoffs between bus delay and efficiency. Finally, since our analytical
approach to the classification and CACs treats the technology-dependent
parameters as variables, our approach can be easily adapted to a wide variety
of technology.

entanglement entropy with the black hole entropy expressed in terms of the

intracluster edge fraction of the null model, i.e., a randomly connected graph

small number of clusters and Q0 favors many balanced (i.e., with approximately
equal degrees) clusters. In certain cases the Q0 term can cause overestimation
of the true cluster number; this is the opposite of the well-known under
estimation effect caused by the ""resolution limit"" of modularity. We illustrate
the overestimation effect by constructing families of graphs with a ""natural""
community structure which, however, does not maximize modularity. In fact, we
prove that we can always find a graph G with a ""natural clustering"" V of G and

most natural scenario leading to observable rates- those ratios depend only on
the seesaw mass scale, offering a quite interesting testing ground. In the case
of sterile neutrinos heavier than the electroweak scale, these ratios vanish
typically for a mass scale of order a few TeV. Furthermore, the analysis
performed here is also valid down to very light masses. It turns out that
planned mu -> e conversion experiments would be sensitive to masses as low as 2

Recent advances in
biology have encouraged using genetically engineered bacteria as the main
component in the molecular communication. This has stimulated a new line of
research that attempts to study molecular communication among bacteria from an
information-theoretic point of view. Due to high randomness in the individual
behavior of the bacterium, reliable communication between two bacteria is
almost impossible. Therefore, we recently proposed that a population of
bacteria in a cluster is considered as a node capable of molecular transmission
and reception. This proposition enables us to form a reliable node out of many
unreliable bacteria. The bacteria inside a node sense the environment and
respond accordingly. In this paper, we study the communication between two
nodes, one acting as the transmitter and the other as the receiver. We consider
the case in which the information is encoded in the concentration of molecules
by the transmitter. The molecules produced by the bacteria in the transmitter
node propagate in the environment via the diffusion process. Then, their
concentration sensed by the bacteria in the receiver node would decode the
information. The randomness in the communication is caused by both the error in
the molecular production at the transmitter and the reception of molecules at
the receiver. We study the theoretical limits of the information transfer rate
in such a setup versus the number of bacteria per node. Finally, we consider
M-ary modulation schemes and study the achievable rates and their error
probabilities.

empirical data, it is natural and correct to proceed with the underlying
assumption that experiments have made good faith efforts to ensure that their
analyses yield unbiased results. However, particle physics experiments are
expensive and time consuming to carry out, thus if an analysis has inherent
bias (even if unintentional), much money and effort can be wasted trying to
replicate or understand the results, particularly if the analysis is
fundamental to our understanding of the universe.
  In this note we discuss the significant biases that can result from data
binning schemes. As we will show, if data are binned such that they provide the
best comparison to a particular (but incorrect) model, the resulting model
parameter estimates when fitting to the binned data can be significantly
biased, leading us to too often accept the model hypothesis when it is not in
fact true. When using binned likelihood or least squares methods there is of
course no a priori requirement that data bin sizes need to be constant, but we
show that fitting to data grouped into variable width bins is particularly
prone to produce biased results if the bin boundaries are chosen to optimize
the comparison of the binned data to a wrong model. The degree of bias that can
be achieved simply with variable binning can be surprisingly large.
  Fitting the data with an unbinned likelihood method, when possible to do so,
is the best way for researchers to show their analyses are not biased by
binning effects. Failing that, equal bin widths should be employed as a
cross-check of the fitting analysis whenever possible.

theories of gravity and establish strict conditions for their {\em global}
equivalence. Such equivalence takes place only for a certain class of
cosmological potentials, dubbed here {\em withholding potentials}, since they
prevent change of the sign of dilaton $\Phi$. The withholding property ensures
the attractive character of gravity, as well as absence of ghosts and a tachyon
in the gravi-dilaton sector and yields certain asymptotic of the admissible
functions $f(R)$. Large classes of withholding cosmological potentials and
functions $f(R)$ are found and described in detail. It is shown that the
popular choices of $f(R)$ functions are not withholding ones. The particle
content of the gravi-dilaton sector is found using perturbation theory around
de Sitter vacuum of MDG. The graviton remains massless, since it obeys
conformal invariant field equation in the de Sitter space-time. The $R/6$ term
in the conformal invariant wave operator introduces a very small mass scale
$m_{R} \approx 1.5 \times 10^{-38} m_e$, $m_e$ being the mass of the electron.
The mass of the dilaton is much larger: $m\gtrapprox 10^{29} m_{R}$. Two new
phenomena: scalaron waves and induction of gravitational waves by the scalaron
field are discussed using the derived wave equations for scalaron and graviton.
The MDG and f(R) theories are shown to predict physical deviations from GR.
Seemingly, the MDG and f(R) theories, when globally equivalent, offer a unified
description of dark energy and dark matter.

of 1672 U-band flares. We also discuss the behaviours of the white-light
flares. In addition, the parameters of the flares detected from two years of
observations on CR Dra are presented. By comparing with the flare parameters
obtained from other UV Ceti type stars, we examine the behaviour of optical
flare processes along the spectral types. Moreover, we aimed, using large
white-light flare data,to analyse the flare time-scales in respect to some
results obtained from the X-ray observations. Using the SPSS V17.0 and the
GraphPad Prism V5.02 software, the flares detected from CR Dra were modelled
with the OPEA function and analysed with t-Test method to compare similar flare
events in other stars. In addition, using some regression calculations in order
to derive the best histograms, the time-scales of the white-light flares were
analysed. Firstly, CR Dra flares have revealed that the white-light flares
behave in a similar way as their counterparts observed in X-rays. As seen in
X-ray observations, the electron density seems to be a dominant parameter in
white-light flare process, too. Secondly, the distributions of the flare
time-scales demonstrate that the number of observed flares gets a maximum value
in some particular ratios, which are 0.5 or its multiples, and especially
positive integers. The thermal processes might be dominant for these
white-light flares, while non-thermal processes might be dominant in the
others. To reach better results for the behaviour of the white-light flare
process along the spectral types, much more stars in a wide spectral range,
from the spectral type dK5e to dM6e, must be observed in the white-light flare
patrols.

the subclass of states $\Omega$ having well defined classical properties. In
particular, a geometric measure of asymmetric discord [Dakic et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett. 105, 190502 (2010)] was recently defined as the Hilbert-Schmidt distance
of a given two-qubit state to the closest classical-quantum (CQ) correlated
state. We analyze a geometric measure of symmetric discord defined as the
Hilbert-Schmidt distance of a given state to the closest classical-classical
(CC) correlated state. The optimal member of $\Omega$ is just specially
measured original state both for the CQ and CC discords. This implies that this
measure is equal to quantum deficit of post-measurement purity. We discuss some
general relations between the CC discords and explain why an analytical formula
for the CC discord, contrary to the CQ discord, can hardly be found even for a
general two-qubit state. Instead of such exact formula, we find simple
analytical measurement-based upper bounds for the CC discord which, as we show,
are very efficient in the case of two qubits and may serve as independent
indicators of two-party quantum correlations. In particular, we propose an
adaptive upper bound, which corresponds to the optimal states induced by
single-party measurements: optimal measurement on one of the parties determines
an optimal measurement on the other party. We discuss how to refine the
adaptive upper bound by nonoptimal single-party measurements and by an
iterative procedure which usually rapidly converges to the CC discord. We also
raise the question of optimality of the symmetric measurements realising the CC
discord on symmetric states, and give partial answer for the qubit case.

ordinary, inner halo globular clusters, the Mg-poor population exhibits
dispersions of several elements. The abundances of K and Sc are strongly
anti-correlated with Mg, and some other elements (Si and Ca among others) are
weakly anti-correlated with Mg. These abundance patterns suggest that the
different populations of NGC 2419 sample the ejecta of diverse supernovae in
addition to AGB ejecta. However, the abundances of Fe-peak elements except Sc
show no star-to-star variation. We find no nucleosynthetic source that

framework that allows for a unified way to classify both models of dark energy

general action for the background can be written in terms of a canonical scalar
field which is non-minimally coupled to matter. The leading corrections to the
action are expressible through a quartic kinetic term, and scalar couplings to
a Gauss-Bonnet curvature term and the Einstein tensor. We determine the
implications of the terms in this general action for the predicted expansion
history in the context of dynamical attractors. We find that each modifies the
matter dominated and/or accelerative eras in ways that allow us to place
cosmological constraints on them. We present current constraints on the

rest-frame mid-infrared (8um) and ultraviolet wavelengths. We attempt to
determine the physical mechanism responsible for this diversity. Dust-obscured
galaxies (DOGs), which have rest-frame mid-IR to UV flux density ratios > 1000,
might be abnormally bright in the mid-IR, perhaps due to prominent AGN and/or
PAH emission, or abnormally faint in the UV. We use far-infrared data from the
GOODS-Herschel survey to show that most DOGs with 10^12 L_Sun < L_IR < 10^13
L_Sun are not abnormally bright in the mid-IR when compared to other dusty
galaxies with similar IR (8--1000um) luminosities. We observe a relation
between the median IR to UV luminosity ratios and the median UV continuum
power-law indices for these galaxies, and we find that only 24% have specific
star formation rates which indicate the dominance of compact star-forming
regions. This circumstantial evidence supports the idea that the UV- and
IR-emitting regions in these galaxies are spatially coincident, which implies a
connection between the abnormal UV faintness of DOGs and dust obscuration. We
conclude that the range in rest-frame mid-IR to UV flux density ratios spanned
by dusty galaxies at z ~ 2 is due to differing amounts of UV obscuration. Of
galaxies with these IR luminosities, DOGs are the most obscured. We attribute
differences in UV obscuration to either: 1) differences in the degree of
alignment between the spatial distributions of dust and massive stars, or 2)
differences in the total dust content.

employ the cylindrically symmetric form of Jeans equations and focus on the
morphology of the resulting acceleration maps, rather than the normalization of
the total mass as done in previous, mostly local, studies. Jeans equations are
first applied to a mock catalog based on a cosmologically derived N-body + SPH
simulation, and the known acceleration (gradient of gravitational potential) is
successfully recovered. The same simulation is also used to quantify the impact
of dark matter on the total acceleration. We use Galfast, a code designed to
quantitatively reproduce SDSS measurements and selection effects, to generate a
synthetic stellar catalog. We apply Jeans equations to this catalog and produce
two-dimensional maps of stellar acceleration. These maps reveal that in a
Newtonian framework, the implied gravitational potential cannot be explained by
visible matter alone. The acceleration experienced by stars at galactocentric
distances of ~20 kpc is three times larger than what can be explained by purely
visible matter. The application of an analytic method for estimating the dark
matter halo axis ratio to SDSS data implies an oblate halo with q_DM = 0.47 +/-
0.14 within the same distance range. These techniques can be used to map the
dark matter halo to much larger distances from the Galactic center using

wide-field survey such as that which will be operated by the Euclid space
mission, assuming a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology. We use the publicly available code
MOKA to obtain realistic deflection angle maps of mock gravitational lenses.
The maps are processed by a ray-tracing code to estimate the strong lensing
cross sections of each lens. Our procedure involves 1) the generation of a
light-cone which is populated with lenses drawn from a theoretical
mass-function; 2) the modeling of each single lens using a triaxial halo with a
NFW (Navarro-Frenk-White) density profile and theoretical concentration-mass
relation, including substructures, 3) the determination of the lensing cross
section as a function of redshift for each lens in the light-cone, 4) the
simulation of mock observations to characterize the redshift distribution of
sources that will be detectable in the Euclid images. We focus on the so-called
giant arcs, i.e. gravitational arcs characterized by large length-to-width
ratios (l/w > 5, 7.5 and 10). We quantify the arc detectability at different
significances above the level of the background. Performing 128 different
realizations of a 15,000 sq. degree survey, we find that the number of arcs
detectable at 1{\sigma} above the local background will be 8912,2914, and 1275
for l/w>5, 7.5 and 10, respectively. The expected arc numbers decrease to 2409,
790, and 346 for a detection limit at 3{\sigma} above the background level.
From our analysis, we find that most of the lenses which contribute to the
lensing optical depth are located at redshifts 0.4<zl<0.7 and that the 50% of
the arcs are images of sources at zs > 3. This is the first step towards the
full characterization of the population of strong lenses that will be observed
by Euclid. [abridged]

nuclear reactions are dynamically important (`Nuclear Dominated Accretion
Flows', or NuDAFs). Examples of such disks are those generated by the merger of
a white dwarf with a neutron star or black hole, or by the collapse of a
rotating star. Here we present two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations that
systematically explore the effect of adding a single nuclear reaction to a
viscous torus. The equation of state, anomalous shear stress, and nuclear
reactions are given parametric forms. Our results point to the existence of two
qualitatively different regimes of NuDAF evolution: (1) steady accretion with
quiescent burning; or (2) detonation of the disk. These outcomes are controlled
primarily by the ratio of the nuclear energy released to the enthalpy at the
burning radius. Disks detonate if this ratio exceeds a critical value (~1), and
if burning occurs in regions where neutrino cooling is unimportant.
Thermonuclear runaways are seeded by the turbulent mixing of hot ash with cold
fuel at the burning front. Subcritical disks do not explode, but instead power
a persistent collimated outflow of unbound material composed primarily of ash,
with a mass-loss rate that increases with the nuclear binding energy released.
We discuss the implications of our results for supernova-like counterparts from
astrophysical events in the NuDAF regime. In particular, detonations following
a white dwarf - neutron star merger could account for some subluminous Type Ia
supernovae, such as the class defined by SN 2002cx.

the function. This new result therefore provides insight on the reason why in
some cases the adversary method is stronger than the polynomial method. It also
reveals a clear picture of the relation between the different lower bound

length is analytically obtained. The RMG point then displays a quantum phase
transition to phase of localized spinons at large disorder. The other mechanism
is a random confinement mechanism which induces an effective interaction
between spinons and brings the chain into a gapless and partially polarized
phase for arbitrarily small disorder.

heterodyne optical circuit capable of simultaneously measuring both of the
mechanical sidebands, and find that the observed optical spring and damping
quantitatively agree with theory. The mechanical sidebands exhibit a Fano
lineshape, and to explain this we develop a theory describing heterodyne
measurements in the presence of correlated classical laser noise. Finally, we
discuss the use of a passive filter cavity to remove classical laser noise, and
consider the future requirements for laser cooling this relatively large and
low-frequency mechanical element to very near its quantum mechanical ground
state.

in estimating an unknown parameter than classically possible. However, how such
a quantum probe should be measured remains somewhat elusive. We examine the
role of measurements in quantum metrology by considering two types of readout
strategies: coherent, where all probes are measured simultaneously in an
entangled basis; and adaptive, where probes are measured sequentially, with
each measurement one way conditioned on the prior outcomes. Here we firstly
show that for classically correlated probes the two readout strategies yield
the same precision. Secondly, we construct an example of a noisy multipartite
quantum system where coherent readout yields considerably better precision than
adaptive readout. This highlights a fundamental difference between classical
and quantum parameter estimation. From the practical point of view, our
findings are relevant for the optimal design of precision-measurement quantum
devices.

novel method for data assimilation: state estimation for noisily observed
time-dependent problems. Since that time it has had enormous impact in many
application domains because of its robustness and ease of implementation, and
numerical evidence of its accuracy. In this paper we propose the application of
an iterative ensemble Kalman method for the solution of a wide class of inverse
problems. In this context we show that the estimate of the unknown function
that we obtain with the ensemble Kalman method lies in a subspace A spanned by
the initial ensemble. Hence the resulting error may be bounded above by the
error found from the best approximation in this subspace. We provide numerical
experiments which compare the error incurred by the ensemble Kalman method for
inverse problems with the error of the best approximation in A, and with
variants on traditional least-squares approaches, restricted to the subspace A.
In so doing we demonstrate that the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems
provides a derivative-free optimization method with comparable accuracy to that
achieved by traditional least-squares approaches. Furthermore, we also
demonstrate that the accuracy is of the same order of magnitude as that
achieved by the best approximation. Three examples are used to demonstrate
these assertions: inversion of a compact linear operator; inversion of
piezometric head to determine hydraulic conductivity in a Darcy model of
groundwater flow; and inversion of Eulerian velocity measurements at positive
times to determine the initial condition in an incompressible fluid.

VLA observations of simulated galaxy clusters to radio observations of Faraday
Rotation Measure (RM) and radio halos. The cluster formation is modeled using
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the
assumption that the initial magnetic fields are injected into the ICM by active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) at high redshift. In addition to simulated clusters in
Xu et al. (2010, 2011), we present a new simulation with magnetic field
injections from multiple AGNs. We find that the cluster with multiple injection
sources is magnetized to a similar level as in previous simulations with a
single AGN. The RM profiles from simulated clusters, both $|RM|$ and the
dispersion of RM ($\sigma_{RM}$), are consistent at a first-order with the
radial distribution from observations. The correlations between the
$\sigma_{RM}$ and X-ray surface brightness from simulations are in a broad
agreement with the observations, although there is an indication that the
simulated clusters could be slightly over-dense and less magnetized with
respect to those in the observed sample. In addition, the simulated radio halos
agree with the observed correlations between the radio power versus the cluster
X-ray luminosity and between the radio power versus the radio halo size. These
studies show that the cluster wide magnetic fields that originate from AGNs and
are then amplified by the ICM turbulence (Xu et al. 2010) match observations of

vector couplings to quarks (an axigluon). We describe and contrast various
aspects of axigluons obtained from the breaking of a chiral SU(3)_L x SU(3)_R
gauge theory both from the standpoint of a string-inspired field theory and
from a quiver analysis of a local type IIa intersecting brane construction.
Special attention is paid to the additional constraints and issues that arise
from these classes of top-down constructions compared with the more common
effective field theory approach. These include the implications of a
perturbative connection to a large scale; Yukawa couplings, which must be
generated from higher-dimensional operators in many constructions; anomaly
cancellation, in particular the implications of the required exotics for the
axigluon width, perturbativity, and the signatures from exotic decays; the
possibility of family nonuniversality via mirror representations, mixing with
exotics, or additional SU(3) factors; the additional constraints from anomalous
U(1) factors in the string constructions; tadpole cancellation, which implies
new uncolored matter; the prevention of string-scale masses for vector pairs;
and various phenomenological issues involving FCNC, CKM constraints, and the
axigluon coupling strength. It is concluded that the construction of viable
axigluon models from type IIa or similar constructions is problematic and would
require considerable fine tuning, but is not entirely excluded. These
considerations illustrate the importance of top-down constraints on possible
TeV-scale physics, independent of the ultimate explanation of the t-tbar
asymmetry.

continuum limit, corresponding to the limit where the `discreteness parameter'
$\lambda$ approaches zero. In particular one might ask whether the limit exists
and, in that case, what the limiting theory is. Here we review recent results
on the classical formulation of the problem for a soluble model in loop quantum
cosmology. We show that it is only through the introduction of a particular
$\lambda$-dependent internal time function that the limit $\lambda\to 0$ can be
well defined. We then compare this result with the existing analysis in the
quantum theory, where the dynamics was cast in terms of an internal
($\lambda$-independent) parameter for which the limit does not exist. We
briefly comment on the steps needed to define the corresponding time parameter
in the quantum theory for which the limit was shown to exist classically.

models. These have midplane densities that follow radial power-laws, and have
either temperature or entropy distributions that are power-law functions of
cylindrical radius. We employ two different hydrodynamic codes to perform
2D-axisymmetric and 3D simulations that examine the long-term evolution of the
disc models as a function of the power-law indices of the temperature or
entropy, the thermal relaxation time of the fluid, and the viscosity. We
present a stability analysis of the problem that we use to interpret the
simulation results. We find that disc models whose temperature or entropy
profiles cause the equilibrium angular velocity to vary with height are
unstable to the growth of modes with wavenumber ratios |k_R/k_Z| >> 1 when the
thermodynamic response of the fluid is isothermal, or the thermal evolution
time is comparable to or shorter than the local dynamical time scale. These
discs are subject to the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) or `vertical shear'
linear instability. Development of the instability involves excitation of
vertical breathing and corrugation modes in the disc, with the corrugation
modes in particular being a feature of the nonlinear saturated state.
Instability operates when the dimensionless disc kinematic viscosity nu <
10^{-6} (Reynolds numbers Re>H c_s/nu > 2500). In 3D the instability generates
a quasi-turbulent flow, and the Reynolds stress produces a fluctuating
effective viscosity coefficient whose mean value reaches alpha ~ 6 x 10^{-4} by
the end of the simulation. The vertical shear instability in disc models which
include realistic thermal physics has yet to be examined. Should it occur,
however, our results suggest that it will have significant consequences for
their internal dynamics, transport properties, and observational appearance.

matching}, where the location data comes from different trips on the same
route, each with very sparse samples. This captures the realistic scenario
where users repeatedly travel on regular routes and samples are sparsely
collected, either due to energy consumption constraints or because samples are
only collected when the user actively uses a service. In the multi-track
problem, the total set of combined locations is only partially ordered, rather
than globally ordered as required by previous map-matching algorithms. We
propose two methods, the iterative projection scheme and the graph Laplacian

approach to improve the accuracy of the estimated paths. In addition, in order
to deal with variable sampling rates in single-track map matching, we propose a
method based on a particular regularized cost function that can be adapted for
different sampling rates and measurement errors. We evaluate the effectiveness

hierarchy pattern can be distinguished at 3\sigma level if sin^22theta_rct

Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata lepton flavor mixing matrix, \delta_mns, can be
constrained with \pm 20^\circ. As a reference, we repeat the same analysis by
placing the same detector in Korea at L=1000km and OAB=0.5^\circ (T2KK) and
also by placing it at the SK site (T2K_122). The Tokai-to-Kamioka-OKI (T2KO)
sensitivity to the mass hierarchy is about 1/3 (in \Delta \chi^2_min) of T2KK,
while the sensitivity to the phase \delta_mns is similar between T2KO and T2KK.
The T2K_122 option has almost no sensitivity to the mass hierarchy, and cannot
measure the CP phase except when \delta_mns \sim -90^\circ (90^\circ) for the
normal (inverted) hierarchy.

width of a set of 28 iron spectral lines spanning a wide range in lambda,
excitation potential, oscillator strength, Land\'e factor, and formation
height. The lines were computed in LTE using the spectral synthesis code LILIA.
We used input magnetoconvection snapshots covering 50 minutes of solar
evolution and belonging to series having an average vertical magnetic flux
density of 0, 50, 100 and 200 G. For the relevant calculations we used the
Copenhagen Stagger code. The presence of magnetic fields causes both a direct
(Zeeman-broadening) effect on spectral lines with non-zero Land\'e factor and
an indirect effect on temperature-sensitive lines via a change in the
photospheric T-tau stratification. The corresponding correction in the
estimated atomic abundance ranges from a few hundredths of a dex up to |Delta
log(Fe)| ~ 0.15 dex, depending on the spectral line and on the amount of
average magnetic flux within the range of values we considered. The
Zeeman-broadening effect gains relatively more importance in the IR. The
largest modification to previous solar abundance determinations based on
visible spectral lines is instead due to the indirect effect, i.e., the
line-weakening caused by a warmer stratification on an optical depth scale. Our
results indicate that the average solar iron abundance obtained when using
magnetoconvection models can be 0.03-0.11 dex higher than when using the
simpler HD convection approach. We demonstrate that accounting for magnetic

occurs near 120 K. With increasing magnetic field and at temperatures below 120
K, this material undergoes transitions from a helimagnetic to a soliton-lattice

transitions are found to strongly affect the electrical transport. The
resistivity decreases sharply upon cooling near 120 K, and the spin
reorientation from the helimagnetic ground state to the commensurate
ferromagnetic state is evident in the magnetoresistance. At high fields a large
magnetoresistance (55 % at 140 kOe) is observed near the magnetic transition
temperature. Heat capacity and electronic structure calculations show the

Via a certain relaxation of minimax MTL, we obtain a continuum of MTL
formulations spanning minimax MTL and classical MTL. The full paradigm itself
is loss-compositional, operating on the vector of empirical risks. It
incorporates minimax MTL, its relaxations, and many new MTL formulations as
special cases. We show theoretically that minimax MTL tends to avoid worst case

the Spin$^c$-structure represented by the combing. When this Euler class is a

theoretically re-analyzed in the light of the recent H.E.S.S. results.
Nonlinear kinetic theory is used to determine the momentum spectrum of cosmic
rays (CRs) in space and time in the supernova remnant SN 1006. The physical
parameters of the model - proton injection rate, electron-to-proton ratio and
downstream magnetic field strength - are determined through a fit of the result
to the observed spatially-integrated synchrotron emission properties. The only
remaining unknown astronomical parameter, the circumstellar gas number density,
is determined by a normalization of the amplitude of the gamma-ray flux to the
observed amplitude. The bipolar morphology of both nonthermal X-ray and
gamma-ray emissions is explained by the preferential injection of suprathermal
nuclei and subsequent magnetic field amplification in the quasi-parallel
regions of the outer supernova shock. The above parameters provide an improved
fit to all existing nonthermal emission data, including the TeV emission
spectrum recently detected by H.E.S.S., with the circumstellar hydrogen gas
number density $N_H\approx 0.06 cm^{-3}$ close to values derived from
observations of thermal X-rays. The hadronic and leptonic gamma-ray emissions
are of comparable strength. The overall energy of accelerated CRs at the
present epoch is of the order of 5 % of the total hydrodynamic explosion
energy, and is predicted to rise with time by a factor of $\approx 2$. The
relevance of CR escape from the SNR for the spectrum of the gamma-ray emission
is demonstrated. The sum of the results suggests that SN 1006 is a CR source
with a high efficiency of nuclear CR production, as required for the Galactic
CR sources, both in flux as well as in cutoff energy.

studied by density functional theory (DFT) calculation with local spin density
approximation plus Hubbard U (LSDA+U). At ambient pressure, A-type and G-type
helical spin orders are almost degenerate in BaFeO3 whose lattice constant is
3.97{\AA} . When the lattice constant is reduced to 3.85 {\AA} which is same as
the lattice constant of SrFeO3 at ambient pressure, G-type helical spin order
becomes stable, being consistent with SrFeO3. This is because superexchange
interaction is enhanced as compared with double exchange interaction. Phase
transition from helical spin state to ferromagnetic state in both SrFeO3 and
BaFeO3 takes place if the lattice constant is further reduced to 3.70 {\AA}.
This is because reduced local spin moment weakens the contribution from
superexchange interaction. Our result agrees with recent experimental result of
BaFeO3 under high pressure. Additionally, our calculation predicts that
half-metal BaFeO3 at ambient pressure will become a good metal under high
pressure

order to find groupings or hierarchy for data with a heavy-tailed distribution.
The heavy-tailed distributions are heavily right skewed, with a minority of
large values in the head and a majority of small values in the tail, commonly
characterized by a power law, a lognormal or an exponential function. For
example, a country's population is often distributed in such a heavy-tailed
manner, with a minority of people (e.g., 20 percent) in the countryside and the
vast majority (e.g., 80 percent) in urban areas. This heavy-tailed distribution
is also called scaling, hierarchy or scaling hierarchy. This new classification
scheme partitions all of the data values around the mean into two parts and
continues the process iteratively for the values (above the mean) in the head
until the head part values are no longer heavy-tailed distributed. Thus, the
number of classes and the class intervals are both naturally determined. We
therefore claim that the new classification scheme is more natural than the
natural breaks in finding the groupings or hierarchy for data with a
heavy-tailed distribution. We demonstrate the advantages of the head/tail
breaks method over Jenks' natural breaks in capturing the underlying hierarchy
of the data.

the practice of gatekeeping.

systems. It embraces the idea of open debate on the merits of a paper; however,
it rejects unequivocally the exercise of gatekeeping. True peer review offers
all the benefits of current peer review systems but has none of its weaknesses.

characteristic time and length scales of thermal vibrations obey critical
scaling in the vicinity of the jamming transition. We show in particular that
the amplitude and the time scale of dynamic fluctuations diverge symmetrically
on both sides of the transition, and directly reveal a diverging correlation
length. The critical region near phi_J is divided in three different regimes
separated by a characteristic temperature scale T*(phi) that vanishes
quadratically with the distance to phi_J. While two of them, (T < T*(phi), phi
> phi_J) and (T < T*(phi), phi < phi_J), are described by harmonic theories
developed in the zero temperature limit, the third one for T > T*(phi) is
inherently anharmonic and displays new critical properties. We find that the
quadratic scaling of T*(phi) is due to nonperturbative anharmonic
contributions, its amplitude being orders of magnitude smaller than the
perturbative prediction based on the expansion to quartic order in the

mutual information over all input distributions with a certain power is for
such channels equivalent to maximizing it over the larger set of input

is always nondecreasing with power if all interferers transmit with identical

charged ions were worthy of relevance in drawing the networks for possible
chemical reactions in the interstellar medium, as well as in modeling the
physical conditions in most of astrophysical environments. Thus, molecular
negative ions received minor attention until their possible existence was
observationally confirmed (discovery of the first interstellar anion, C6H-),
about thirty years after the first physically reasonable proposal on their
actual detection was theoretically surmised by E.Herbst. In an astrophysical
context, their role should be then found in their involvement in the charge
balance as well as in the chemical evolution of the considered environment:
depending on their amount and on the global gas density, in fact, the possible
evolutive scenario could be susceptible of marked variations on the estimated
time needed for reaching the steady state, their presence having thus also
important repercussions on the final chemical composition of a given
environment. The main reasons that originally motivated us to undertake the
present work, were at least two. First of all, we intended to demonstrate the
importance of resonances in forming molecular anions in different astrophysical
environments. Secondly, we were attracted by the possibility of investigating
the occurrence of radiationless paths like intramolecular vibrational
redistributions to account for the dissipation of the extra energy initially
carried by the impinging electron. Accordingly, the present PhD represents a
theoretical/computational work which deals with an area placed at the boundary
between (molecular) astrophysics, quantum collision thery, and theoretical
chemistry. The three molecular species whose behaviour under low-energy
electron collisions will be discussed are: the ortho-benzyne, the coronene and
the carbon nitride.

$\operatorname{Diff}_{1}(\mathbb R)$ equipped with the homogenous Sobolev
metric of order one is a flat space in the sense of Riemannian geometry, as it
is isometric to an open subset of a mapping space equipped with the flat
$L^2$-metric. Here $\operatorname{Diff}_{1}(\mathbb R)$ denotes the extension
of the group of all either compactly supported, rapidly decreasing or

particular this result provides an analytic solution formula for the
corresponding geodesic equation, the non-periodic Hunter-Saxton equation. In
addition we show that one can obtain a similar result for the two-component
Hunter-Saxton equation and discuss the case of the non-homogenous Sobolev one
metric which is related to the Camassa-Holm equation.

is clustering under certain conditions. In particular, when a
quasi-two-dimensional monolayer of mono-disperse non-cohesive particles is
vertically vibrated, a solid-liquid-like transition occurs when the driving
amplitude exceeds a critical value. Here, the physical mechanism underlying
particle clustering relies on the strong interactions mediated by grain
collisions, rather than on grain-grain cohesive forces. In average, the solid
cluster resembles a drop, with a striking circular shape. We experimentally
investigate the coarse-grained solid-liquid interface fluctuations, which are
characterized through the static and dynamic correlation functions in the
Fourier space. These fluctuations turn out to be well described by the
capillary wave theory, which allows us to measure the solid-liquid interface
surface tension and mobility once the granular ""thermal"" kinetic energy is
determined. Despite the system is strongly out of equilibrium and that the
granular temperature is not uniform, there is energy equipartition at the
solid-liquid interface, for a relatively large range of angular wave-numbers.
Furthermore, both surface tension and mobility are consistent with a simple
order of magnitude estimation considering the characteristic energy, length and
time scales, which is very similar to what can be done for atomic systems.

  Ising ferromagnet swept by a propagating magnetic field wave is studied at

were identified. These four nonequilibrium phases are characterised by
different values of structure factors. State of first kind, where all spins are
parallel (up). The second one is, the propagating type, where the sharp strips
formed by parallel spins are found to move coherently. The third one is also
propagating type, where the boundary of the strips of spins is not very sharp.
The fourth kind, shows no propagation of stripes of magnetic spins, forming a
homogeneous distribution of up and down spins. This is disordered phase The
appearance of these four dynamical phases or modes depends on the value of the

  in the proceedings of the 1st Mediterranean Conference on Algorithms",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present and study a new model for energy-aware and profit-oriented
scheduling on a single processor. The processor features dynamic speed scaling
as well as suspension to a sleep mode. Jobs arrive over time, are preemptable,
and have different sizes, values, and deadlines. On the arrival of a new job,
the scheduler may either accept or reject the job. Accepted jobs need a certain
energy investment to be finished in time, while rejected jobs cause costs equal
to their values. Here, power consumption at speed $s$ is given by
$P(s)=s^{\alpha}+\beta$ and the energy investment is power integrated over
time. Additionally, the scheduler may decide to suspend the processor to a
sleep mode in which no energy is consumed, though awaking entails fixed
transition costs $\gamma$. The objective is to minimize the total value of
rejected jobs plus the total energy.
  Our model combines aspects from advanced energy conservation techniques
(namely speed scaling and sleep states) and profit-oriented scheduling models.
We show that \emph{rejection-oblivious} schedulers (whose rejection decisions
are not based on former decisions) have -- in contrast to the model without
sleep states -- an unbounded competitive ratio w.r.t\text{.} the processor
parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. It turns out that the worst-case performance
of such schedulers depends linearly on the jobs' value densities (the ratio
between a job's value and its work). We give an algorithm whose competitiveness
nearly matches this lower bound. If the maximum value density is not too large,
the competitiveness becomes $\alpha^{\alpha}+2e\alpha$. Also, we show that it
suffices to restrict the value density of low-value jobs only. Using a
technique from \cite{Chan:2010} we transfer our results to processors with a
fixed maximum speed.

We extend all theories to include magnetic fields, and show that the SFR
depends on four basic parameters: (1) virial parameter alpha_vir; (2) sonic
Mach number M; (3) turbulent forcing parameter b, which is a measure for the
fraction of energy driven in compressive modes; and (4) plasma beta=2(M_A/M)^2

numbers M = 3 to 50 and M_A = 1 to infinity, with solenoidal (b=1/3), mixed
(b=0.4) and compressive turbulent (b=1) forcings. We find that the SFR
increases by a factor of four between M=5 and 50 for compressive forcing and
alpha_vir~1. Comparing forcing parameters, we see that the SFR is more than 10x
higher with compressive than solenoidal forcing for Mach 10 simulations. The
SFR and fragmentation are both reduced by a factor of two in strongly
magnetized, trans-Alfvenic turbulence compared to hydrodynamic turbulence. All
simulations are fit simultaneously by the multi-freefall KM and multi-freefall
PN theories within a factor of two over two orders of magnitude in SFR. The
simulated SFRs cover the range and correlation of SFR column density with gas
column density observed in Galactic clouds, and agree well for star formation
efficiencies SFE = 1% to 10% and local efficiencies epsilon = 0.3 to 0.7 due to
feedback. We conclude that the SFR is primarily controlled by interstellar
turbulence, with a secondary effect coming from magnetic fields.

missed STEREO-A entirely. The observations demonstrate how sympathetic solar

equipotential surface of the gravity field of the Earth that accounts for the

the sense of least squares) the mean level of oceans, but the geoid is more
difficult to determine over continents. Satellite missions carry out distance
measurements and derive the gravity field to provide geoid maps over the entire
globe. However, they require calibration and extensive computations including
integration, which is a non-unique operation. Here we propose a direct method
and a new tool that directly measures geopotential differences on continents
using atomic clocks. General Relativity Theory predicts constant clock rate at
sea level, and faster (resp. slower) clock rate above (resp. below) sea level.
The technology of atomic clocks is on the doorstep of reaching an accuracy
level in clock rate that is equivalent to 1 cm in determining equipotential
surface (including geoid) height. We discuss the value and future applicability
of such measurements including direct geoid mapping on continents, and joint
gravity and geopotential surveying to invert for subsurface density anomalies.
Our synthetic calculations show that the geoid perturbation caused by a 1.5 km
radius sphere with 20% density anomaly buried at 2 km depth in the crust of the
Earth is already detectable by atomic clocks of achievable accuracy. Therefore
atomic clock geopotential surveys, used together with relative gravity data to
benefit from their different depth sensitivities, can become a useful tool in
mapping density anomalies within the Earth.

Different scenarios of population imbalance ranging from the completely
imbalanced case where the physics of a single impurity in the Fermi-sea is
discussed to the partially imbalanced and equal population configurations are
investigated. For the numerical calculations the multi-configurational
time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method is employed, extending its application to
few-fermion systems. Apart from numerical calculations we generalize our Ansatz
for a correlated pair wave-function proposed in [1] for bosons to mixtures of
fermions. From weak to strong coupling between the components the energies, the
densities and the correlation properties of one-dimensional systems change
vastly with an upper limit set by fermionization where for infinite repulsion
all fermions can be mapped to identical ones. The numerical and analytical
treatments are in good agreement with respect to the description of this
crossover. We show that for equal populations each pair of different component
atoms splits into two single peaks in the density while for partial imbalance
additional peaks and plateaus arise for very strong interaction strengths. The
case of a single impurity atom shows rich behaviour of the energy and density
as we approach fermionization, and is directly connected to recent experiments

superstring equations. For example, for a bosonic string in AdS_n such an
action contains a Liouville scalar part plus a K/K gauged WZW model for the
group K=SO(n-2) coupled to another term depending on two additional fields
transforming as vectors under K. Solving for the latter fields gives a
non-abelian Toda model coupled to the Liouville theory. For n=5 we generalize
this bosonic action to include the S^5 contribution and fermionic terms. The
corresponding reduced model for the AdS_2 x S^2 truncation of the full AdS_5 x
S^5 superstring turns out to be equivalent to N=2 super Liouville theory. Our
construction is based on taking a limit of the previously found reduced theory
actions for bosonic strings in AdS_n x S^1 and superstrings in AdS_5 x S^5.
This new action may be useful as a starting point for possible quantum
generalizations or deformations of the classical Pohlmeyer-reduced theory. We

also obtained. In the present work, it is shown that the theory can be also
formulated in terms of the quantity $X\equiv \kappa^2 T+R$, where T and R are
the traces of the stress-energy and Ricci tensors, respectively. The variable X
represents the deviation with respect to the field equation trace of general

simultaneously well defined, such as the momentum and position due to
Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Some alternative theories have been explored,
notably the non-contextual hidden variable theories in which the properties of
a system have pre-defined values which are independent of the measurement
contextual. However, the Kochen-Specker theorem showed that such non-contextual
hidden variable theories are in conflict with quantum mechanics. Recently, a
state-independent inequality satisfied by non-contextual hidden variable
theories and violated by quantum mechanics is proposed in the simplest
three-state system (a qutrit) by the least 13 projection measurement rays.
Here, we report an experimental demonstration of the violation of this
inequality. This provides a state-independent experimental test of quantum
contextuality, for the first time in solid state system, by a natural qutrit of
nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond at room temperature.

determined to be about 7 kBT for our system. We additionally show that Langmuir

generated. We will address new services like social TV and recommendation
engines, dissemination including new paradigms built on peer to peer and
content centric networks, as well as the all important quality of experience
that challenges services and networks alike. But we intend to go further than
just review the existing work by proposing areas for the future of television
research. These include strategies to provide services that are more efficient
in network and energy usage while being socially engaging, novel services that
will provide consumers with a broader choice of content and devices, and
metrics that will enable operators and users alike to define the level of
service they require or that they are ready to provide. These topics are
addressed in this survey paper that attempts to create a unifying framework to
link them all together. Not only is television not dead, it is well alive,

temperature, in the range 17.5-20 K in the dense condensations or filaments,
21-22 K in the photodissociation regions, and 24-31 K in the direction of the
ionized regions. The column densities are rather low, everywhere lower than
10^23 cm-2, and of the order of a few 10^21 cm-2 in the PDRs. About 8000 solar
masses of neutral material surrounds the ionized region, which is low with
respect to the volume of this HII region; we suggest that the exciting stars of
the W5-E, W5-W, Sh~201, A and B HII regions formed along a dense filament or
sheet rather than inside a more spherical cloud. Fifty point sources have been
detected at 100 microns. Most of them are Class 0/I YSOs. The SEDs of their
envelopes have been fitted using a modified blackbody model. These envelopes
are cold, with a mean temperature of 15.7+-1.8K. Their masses are in the range
1.3-47 solar masses. Eleven of these point sources are candidate Class 0 YSOs.
Twelve of these point sources are possibly at the origin of bipolar outflows
detected in this region. None of the YSOs contain a massive central object, but
a few may form a massive star as they have both a massive envelope and also a
high envelope accretion rate. Most of the Class 0/I YSOs are observed in the
direction of high column density material, for example in the direction of the
massive condensations present at the waist of the bipolar Sh 201 HII region or
enclosed by the bright-rimmed cloud BRC14. The overdensity of Class 0/I YSOs on
the borders of the HII regions strongly suggests that triggered star formation
is at work in this region but, due to insufficient resolution, the exact
processes at the origin of the triggering are difficult to determine.

type in symbolic dynamics is related to the Morita theory and the Grothendieck
group in the theory of Leavitt path algebras \cite{flowa}. In this paper we
show that the notion of conjugacy of shifts of finite type is closely related
to the {\it graded} Morita theory and consequently the {\it graded}
Grothendieck group. This fits into the general framework we have in these two
theories: Conjugacy yields the flow equivalence and the graded Morita
equivalence can be lifted to the Morita equivalence. Starting from a finite
directed graph, the observation that the graded Grothendieck group of the
Leavitt path algebra associated to $E$ coincides with the Krieger dimension
group of the shift of finite type associated to $E$ provides a link between the
theory of Leavitt path algebras and symbolic dynamics. It has been conjectured
that the ordered graded Grothendieck group as $\mathbb Z[x,x^{-1}]$-module (we
call this the graded dimension group) classifies the Leavitt path algebras
completely \cite{hazann}. Via the above correspondence, utilising the results
from symbolic dynamics, we prove that for two purely infinite simple unital
Leavitt path algebras, if their graded dimension groups are isomorphic, then
the algebras are isomorphic.

computational speed and polarization imaging has been implemented. We couple
continuum sources with equatorial scattering regions, polar outflows, and
toroidal obscuring dust and we study the resulting polarization. We compute a
grid of thermal AGN models for different half-opening angles of the torus and
polar winds. We also consider a range of optical depths for equatorial and
polar electron scattering and investigate how the model geometry influences the
type-1/type-2 polarization dichotomy for thermal AGNs. We put new constrains on
the inflowing medium within the inner walls of the torus. The inflow should be
confined to the common equatorial plane of the torus and the accretion disc and
have a radial optical depth of 1 < tau < 3. Our modeling of type-1 AGNs also
indicates that the torus is more likely to have a large (~ 60{\deg})
half-opening angle. Polarization perpendicular to the axis of the torus may
arise at a type-1 viewing angle for a torus half-opening angle of 30{\deg}-
45{\deg} or polar outflows with an optical depth near unity. Our modeling
suggests that most Seyfert-2 AGN must have a half-opening angle > 60{\deg} to
match the level of perpendicular polarization expected. If outflows are
collimated by the torus inner walls, they must not be optically thick (tau < 1)
in order to preserve the polarization dichotomy. The wind's optical depth is
found not to play a critical role for the degree of polarization of type-2
thermal AGNs but it has a significant impact on the type-1/type-2 polarization

track a given desired attitude trajectory, while guaranteeing almost
semi-global exponential stability. It is extended to achieve global exponential
stability by using a hybrid control scheme based on multiple configuration
error functions. They are further extended to obtain robustness with respect to
a fixed disturbance using an integral term. The resulting robust, global

enhanced by relativistic effects. The velocity field is highly intermittent,
