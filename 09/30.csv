30,000 species. Although molecular phylogenetics has begun to disentangle major
evolutionary relationships within this vast section of the Tree of Life, there
is no widely available approach for efficiently collecting phylogenomic data
within fishes, leaving much of the enormous potential of massively parallel
sequencing technologies for resolving major radiations in ray-finned fishes
unrealized. Here, we provide a genomic perspective on longstanding questions
regarding the diversification of major groups of ray-finned fishes through
targeted enrichment of ultraconserved nuclear DNA elements (UCEs) and their
flanking sequence. Our workflow efficiently and economically generates data
sets that are orders of magnitude larger than those produced by traditional
approaches and is well-suited to working with museum specimens. Analysis of the
UCE data set recovers a well-supported phylogeny at both shallow and deep
time-scales that supports a monophyletic relationship between Amia and
Lepisosteus (Holostei) and reveals elopomorphs and then osteoglossomorphs to be
the earliest diverging teleost lineages. Divergence time estimation based upon
14 fossil calibrations reveals that crown teleosts appeared ~270 Ma at the end
of the Permian and that elopomorphs, osteoglossomorphs, ostarioclupeomorphs,
and euteleosts diverged from one another by 205 Ma during the Triassic. Our
approach additionally reveals that sequence capture of UCE regions and their
flanking sequence offers enormous potential for resolving phylogenetic
relationships within ray-finned fishes.

is generally dominated by instrumental noise. Due to the entirely different
scaling behavior of the noise and the solar magnetic pattern it has been
possible to determine the standard deviation of the Gaussian noise distribution
and remove the noise contribution from the average unsigned flux density for
the whole 15-yr SOHO/MDI data set and for a selection of SDO/HMI magnetograms.
There is a very close correlation between the MDI disk-averaged unsigned
vertical flux density and the sunspot number, and regression analysis gives a
residual level of 2.7 G when the sunspot number is zero. The selected set of
HMI magnetograms, which spans the most quiet phase of solar activity, has a
lower limit of 3.0 G to the noise-corrected average flux density. These
apparently cycle-independent levels may be identified as a basal flux density,
which represents an upper limit to the possible flux contribution from a local
dynamo, but not evidence for its existence. The 3.0 G HMI level, when scaled to
the Hinode spatial resolution, translates to 3.5 G, which means that the much
higher average flux densities always found by Hinode in quiet regions do not
originate from a local dynamo. The contributions to the average unsigned flux
density come almost exclusively from the extended wings of the probability
density function (PDF), also in the case of HMI magnetograms with only
basal-level magnetic flux. These wings represent intermittent magnetic flux.
While the global dynamo appears to dominate the magnetic energy spectrum at all
the resolved spatial scales, there are indications from the observed Hanle
depolarization in atomic lines that the local dynamo may dominate the spectrum
at scales of order 1-10 km and below.

effect of dimensionality on the threshold $\eta_c$ of overlapping nonspherical

relation for $\eta_c$ that is based on this lower bound and a conjecture that
hyperspheres provide the highest threshold among all convex hyperparticle
shapes for any $d$. This scaling relation exploits the principle that
low-dimensional continuum percolation behavior encodes high-dimensional

{\it radius of mean curvature} ${\bar R}$ (or, equivalently, {\it mean width}).

construct matrices with the restricted isometry property (RIP) whose
performance rivals those generated using random matrix theory. In short, RIP
involves estimating the singular values of a combinatorially large number of
submatrices, seemingly requiring an enormous amount of computation in even
low-dimensional examples. In this paper, we consider a similar problem
involving submatrix singular value estimation, namely the problem of explicitly

latest invention in a long line of research concerning the design of linear
encoders that are robust against data loss. We begin by focusing on a subtle
difference between the definition of a NERF and that of an RIP matrix, one that
allows us to introduce a new computational trick for quickly estimating NERF

operator at every point of an epsilon-net for the unit sphere. We then borrow
ideas from the theory of group frames to construct explicit frames and
epsilon-nets with such high degrees of symmetry that the requisite number of
operator evaluations is greatly reduced. We conclude with numerical results,
using these new ideas to quickly produce decent estimates of NERF bounds which

open, this work nevertheless demonstrates the feasibility of exploiting
symmetry to greatly reduce the computational burden of similar combinatorial

One particular combination of these arbitrary vectors reduces the superficial
divergency down to a logarithmic one. The remaining ambiguity is then fixed by
exploiting gauge invariance and the Goldstone Boson Equivalence Theorem. Our
method is strictly realised in four-dimensions. The result for the amplitude
agrees with the ""famous"" one obtained using dimensional regularisation (DR) in
the limit d-> 4, where d is the number of spatial dimensions in Euclidean

  Interactions in a Trapped Ion Quantum Simulator",,,"10.1126/science.1232296",,"quant-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Frustration, or the competition between interacting components of a network,
is often responsible for the complexity of many body systems, from social and
neural networks to protein folding and magnetism. In quantum magnetic systems,
frustration arises naturally from competing spin-spin interactions given by the
geometry of the spin lattice or by the presence of long-range antiferromagnetic
couplings. Frustrated magnetism is a hallmark of poorly understood systems such
as quantum spin liquids, spin glasses and spin ices, whose ground states are
massively degenerate and can carry high degrees of quantum entanglement. The
controlled study of frustrated magnetism in materials is hampered by short
dynamical time scales and the presence of impurities, while numerical modeling
is generally intractable when dealing with dynamics beyond N~30 particles.
Alternatively, a quantum simulator can be exploited to directly engineer
prescribed frustrated interactions between controlled quantum systems, and
several small-scale experiments have moved in this direction. In this article,
we perform a quantum simulation of a long-range antiferromagnetic quantum Ising
model with a transverse field, on a crystal of up to N = 16 trapped Yb+ atoms.
We directly control the amount of frustration by continuously tuning the range
of interaction and directly measure spin correlation functions and their
dynamics through spatially-resolved spin detection. We find a pronounced
dependence of the magnetic order on the amount of frustration, and extract
signatures of quantum coherence in the resulting phases.

codes to Flash memories. Multiple cell reads with distinct word-line voltages
provide limited-precision soft information for the LDPC decoder. The values of
the word-line voltages (also called reference voltages) are optimized by
maximizing the mutual information (MI) between the input and output of the
multiple-read channel. Constraining the maximum mutual-information (MMI)
quantization to enforce a constant-ratio constraint provides a significant
simplification with no noticeable loss in performance.
  Our simulation results suggest that for a well-designed LDPC code, the
quantization that maximizes the mutual information will also minimize the frame
error rate. However, care must be taken to design the code to perform well in
the quantized channel. An LDPC code designed for a full-precision Gaussian
channel may perform poorly in the quantized setting. Our LDPC code designs
provide an example where quantization increases the importance of absorbing
sets thus changing how the LDPC code should be optimized.
  Simulation results show that small increases in precision enable the LDPC
code to significantly outperform a BCH code with comparable rate and block
length (but without the benefit of the soft information) over a range of frame
error rates.

HFMT technique requires off-the-shelf hardware (CCD cameras) and printable 2-D
circular marks used as fiducials for tracking a mobile industrial robot on a
pre-defined path. This proposed technique allows the robot to track on a
predefined path by using fiducials for the detection of Right and Left turns on
the path and White Strip for tracking the path. The HFMT technique is
implemented and tested on an indoor mobile robot at our laboratory.
Experimental results from robot navigating in real environments have confirmed

a hybrid regularization consisting of a higher covariant derivative

star. To examine the characteristics of the post-impact remnant star, we have
carried out three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of supernova impacts on
main sequence-like stars. We explore the evolution of the post-impact remnants
using the stellar evolution code MESA. We find that the luminosity and radius
of the remnant star dramatically increase just after the impact. After the
explosion, post-impact companions continue to expand on a progenitor-dependent
timescale of $\sim 10^{2.5-3} $ yr before contracting. It is found that the
time evolution of the remnant star is dependent on not only the amount of
energy absorbed, but also on the depth of the energy deposition. We examine the
viability of the candidate star Tycho G as the possible remnant companion in
Tycho's supernova by comparing it to the evolved post-impact remnant stars in
our simulations. The closest model in our simulations has a similar effective
temperature, but the luminosity and radius are twice as large. By examining the
angular momentum distribution in our simulations, we find that the surface
rotational speed could drop to $\sim 10$ km s$^{-1}$ if the specific angular
momentum is conserved during the post-impact evolution, implying that Tycho G
cannot be completely ruled out because of its low surface rotation speed.

Here, we present a strong physical argument for the quantum theoretical
property that every state space (even the smallest possible one, the qubit) has
infinitely many pure states. We propose a simple physical postulate which
dictates that in fact the only possible discrete theory is classical mechanics.
More specifically, we postulate that no information gain implies no
disturbance, or read in the contrapositive, that disturbance leads to some form
of information gain. In a theory like quantum mechanics where we already know
that the converse holds, i.e. information gain does imply disturbance, this can
be understood as postulating an equivalence between disturbance and information
gain. What is more, we show that non-classical discrete theories are still
ruled out even if we relax the postulate to hold only approximately in the
sense that no information gain only causes a small amount of disturbance.
Finally, our postulate also rules out popular generalizations such as the
PR-box that allows non-local correlations beyond the limits of quantum theory.

existence of a stable interval for the quantum correlation in the beginning

we write in terms of it the most general unitary gauge action consistent with
the residual unbroken symmetries of spatial diffeomorphisms. Our action is
particularly suited for cosmological perturbation theory: the background
evolution depends on only three operators. All other operators start at least
at quadratic order in the perturbations and their effects can be studied
independently and systematically. In particular, we focus on the properties of
a few operators which appear in non-minimally coupled scalar-tensor gravity and
galileon theories. In this context, we study the mixing between gravity and the
scalar degree of freedom. We assess the quantum and classical stability, derive
the speed of sound of fluctuations and the renormalization of the Newton
constant. The scalar can always be de-mixed from gravity at quadratic order in
the perturbations, but not necessarily through a conformal rescaling of the
metric. We show how to express covariant field-operators in our formalism and
give several explicit examples of dark energy and modified gravity models in
our language. Finally, we discuss the relation with the covariant EFT methods

have {\em sharp} multi-unit demand. This means that each buyer $i$ wants a
specific number $d_i$ of items; a bundle of size less than $d_i$ has no value,
while a bundle of size greater than $d_i$ is worth no more than the most valued
$d_i$ items (valuations being additive). We consider the objective of setting
prices and allocations in order to maximize the total revenue of the market
maker. The pricing problem with sharp multi-unit demand buyers has a number of
properties that the unit-demand model does not possess, and is an important
question in algorithmic pricing. We consider the problem of computing a revenue
maximizing solution for two solution concepts: competitive equilibrium and
envy-free pricing.
  For unrestricted valuations, these problems are NP-complete; we focus on a
realistic special case of ""correlated values"" where each buyer $i$ has a
valuation $v_i\qual_j$ for item $j$, where $v_i$ and $\qual_j$ are positive
quantities associated with buyer $i$ and item $j$ respectively. We present a
polynomial time algorithm to solve the revenue-maximizing competitive
equilibrium problem. For envy-free pricing, if the demand of each buyer is
bounded by a constant, a revenue maximizing solution can be found efficiently;
the general demand case is shown to be NP-hard.

  Probability Over Rayleigh Fading Channel","8 pages, 4 figures, ICIIS 2010",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Except for a few simple digital modulation techniques, derivation of average
bit error probability over fading channels is difficult and is an involved
process. In this letter, curve fitting technique has been employed to express
bit error probability over AWGN of any digital modulation scheme in terms of a
simple Gaussian function. Using this Gaussian function, a generalized closed
form expression for computing average probability of bit error over Rayleigh
fading channels has been derived. Excellent agreement has been found between
error probabilities computed with our method and the rigorously calculated
error probabilities of several digital modulation schemes.

supersymmetric dark matter searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.
In particular, I analyse the role of time-dependent dilaton fields in relaxing
some of the stringent constraints that characterise minimal supersymmetric
models in standard cosmology. I also study briefly CPT-violating aspects of
brane Universe models with space-time brane defects at early epochs and their
potential relevance to the observed Baryon Asymmetry.

result for $\infty$-categories. In particular, we show that the unital
structure of an $\infty$-category can be uniquely recovered from the underlying
non-unital structure once suitable candidates for units have been identified.
The main result of this paper can be used to produce a proof for the
1-dimensional cobordism hypothesis, as described in a forthcoming paper.

than the Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. This new structure can give
an explanation of the form of the galactic rotation curves, of the amount of
intergalactic gravitational lensing, and of the accelerating expansion of the
Universe.

$f$, we utilize generalized Noether theorem and use generalized vector fields
as variational symmetries of the corresponding Lagrangian. We study the
cosmological consequences of the obtained results.
