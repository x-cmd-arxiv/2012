edge states is verified for a variety of external confining potentials. Then,
we describe a specific laser probe, made from two lasers in Laguerre-Gaussian

particular, the resulting Bragg spectra provide the dispersion relation of the
edge states, establishing their chiral nature. In order to make the Bragg
signal experimentally detectable, we introduce a ""shelving method"", which
simultaneously transfers angular momentum and changes the internal atomic
state. This scheme allows to directly visualize the selected edge states on a

supermassive black hole is a matter of active debate. Here we present a method
for testing if the GeV emission of powerful blazars is produced within the
sub-pc scale broad line region (BLR) or farther out in the pc-scale molecular
torus (MT) environment. If the GeV emission takes place within the BLR, the
inverse Compton (IC) scattering of the BLR ultraviolet (UV) seed photons that
produces the gamma-rays takes place at the onset of the Klein-Nishina regime.
This causes the electron cooling time to become practically energy independent
and the variation of the gamma-ray emission to be almost achromatic. If on the
other hand the gamma-ray emission is produced farther out in the pc-scale MT,
the IC scattering of the infrared (IR) MT seed photons that produces the
gamma-rays takes place in the Thomson regime, resulting to energy-dependent
electron cooling times, manifested as faster cooling times for higher Fermi
energies. We demonstrate these characteristics and discuss the applicability
and limitations of our method.

induced in second derivative $d^2I/dV^2$. In the strong coupling limit, the
local negative U centers are formed at impurity sites, and the Dirac cone
structure is fully destroyed locally. At intermediate coupling resonance peaks
emerge. We map out the evolution of the resonance peaks from weak to strong
coupling, which interpolate nicely between the two limits. There is a sudden
qualitative change of behavior at intermediate coupling, indicating the
possible existence of a local quantum phase transition. We also find that even
for a simple local phonon mode the inherent coupling of spin and orbital
degrees in TI leads to the spin polarized texture in inelastic Friedel
oscillations induced by local mode.

survey at 3.4-22 micron. We merge the WISE data with optical SDSS data and
provide a phenomenological characterization of mid-IR, extragalactic sources.
WISE is most sensitive at 3.4micron(W1) and least at 22micron(W4). The W1 band
probes massive early-type galaxies out to z\gtrsim1. This is more distant than
SDSS identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of
3.4micron sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r>22.2). In contrast,
92-95% of 12 and 22micron sources have SDSS optical counterparts with r<22.2.
WISE 3.4micron detects 89.8% of the entire SDSS QSO catalog at SNR(W1)>7, but
only 18.9% at 22micron with SNR(W4)>5. We show that WISE colors alone are
effective in isolating stars (or local early-type galaxies), star-forming
galaxies and strong AGN/QSOs at z<3. We highlight three major applications of
WISE colors: (1) Selection of strong AGN/QSOs at z<3 using W1-W2>0.8 and
W2<15.2 criteria, producing a census of this population. The surface density of
these strong AGN/QSO candidates is 67.5+-0.14/deg^2. (2) Selection of
dust-obscured, type-2 AGN/QSO candidates. We show that WISE W1-W2>0.8, W2<15.2
combined with r-W2>6 (Vega) colors can be used to identify type-2 AGN
candidates. The fraction of these type-2 AGN candidates is 1/3rd of all WISE
color-selected AGNs. (3) Selection of ULIRGs at z\sim2 with extremely red

online scheduling method that only requires easily measurable knowledge of the

can be readily added (e.g. radial velocity, distance). We use this method to
find new young low-mass stars in the \beta Pictoris (\beta PMG) and AB Doradus
(ABDMG) moving groups and in the TW Hydrae (TWA), Tucana-Horologium (THA),
Columba, Carina and Argus associations. Starting from a sample of 758 mid-KM
(K5V-M5V) stars showing youth indicators such as H\alpha\ and X-ray emission,
our analysis yields 215 new highly probable low-mass members of the kinematic
groups analyzed. One is in TWA, 37 in \beta PMG, 17 in THA, 20 in Columba, 6 in
Carina, 50 in Argus, 33 in ABDMG, and the remaining 51 candidates are likely
young but have an ambiguous membership to more than one association. The false
alarm rate for new candidates is estimated to be 5% for \beta PMG and TWA, 10%
for THA, Columba, Carina and Argus, and 14% for ABDMG. Our analysis confirms
the membership of 58 stars proposed in the literature. Firm membership
confirmation of our new candidates will require measurement of their radial
velocity (predicted by our analysis), parallax and lithium 6708 {\AA}
equivalent width. We have initiated these follow-up observations for a number
of candidates and we have identified two stars (2MASSJ0111+1526,
2MASSJ0524-1601) as very strong candidate members of the \beta PMG and one
strong candidate member (2MASSJ0533-5117) of the THA; these three stars have
radial velocity measurements confirming their membership and lithium detections
consistent with young age. Finally, we proposed that six stars should be
considered as new bona fide members of \beta PMG and ABDMG, one of which being
first identified in this work, the others being known candidates from the

primarily from excess elongation of the eye. The etiology of myopia, although
known to be complex, is poorly understood. Here we report the largest ever
genome-wide association study (43,360 participants) on myopia in Europeans. We
performed a survival analysis on age of myopia onset and identified 19
significant associations (p < 5e-8), two of which are replications of earlier
associations with refractive error. These 19 associations in total explain 2.7%
of the variance in myopia age of onset, and point towards a number of different
mechanisms behind the development of myopia. One association is in the gene
PRSS56, which has previously been linked to abnormally small eyes; one is in a
gene that forms part of the extracellular matrix (LAMA2); two are in or near
genes involved in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal (RGR and RDH5); two are
near genes known to be involved in the growth and guidance of retinal ganglion
cells (ZIC2, SFRP1); and five are in or near genes involved in neuronal
signaling or development. These novel findings point towards multiple genetic
factors involved in the development of myopia and suggest that complex
interactions between extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and
visual signals from the retina may underlie the development of myopia in
humans.

  abandoned","14 pages, 25 references, no figure/table",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  In 1922, JBS Haldane discovered an intriguing bias of postzygotic isolation
during early speciation: the heterogametic sex of F1 hybrids between closely
related species or subspecies is more susceptible to sterility or inviability
than the homogametic sex. This phenomenon, now known as Haldane's rule, has
been repeatedly confirmed across broad taxa in diecious animals and plants.
Currently, the dominant view in the field of speciation genetics believes that
Haldane's rule for sterility, inviability, male heterogamety and female
heterogametic belongs to different entities; and Haldane's rule in these
subdivisions has different causes, which operate coincidentally and/or
collectively resulting in this striking bias against the heterogametic sex in
hybridization. This view, known as the composite theory, was developed after
many unsuccessful quests in searching for a unitary genetic mechanism. The
composite theory has multiple sub-theories. The dominance theory and the faster
male theory are the major ones. In this note, I challenge the composite theory
and its scientific validity. By declaring Haldane's rule as a composite
phenomenon caused by multiple mechanisms coincidentally/collectively, the
composite theory becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and untestable. I believe
that the composite theory is an ad hoc hypothesis that lacks falsifiability,
refutability and testability that a scientific theory requires. It is my belief
that the composite theory does not provide meaningful insights for the study of
speciation and should be abandoned.

  preference",,,,,"q-bio.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The leaves of the Coriandrum sativum plant, known as cilantro or coriander,
are widely used in many cuisines around the world. However, far from being a
benign culinary herb, cilantro can be polarizing---many people love it while
others claim that it tastes or smells foul, often like soap or dirt. This soapy
or pungent aroma is largely attributed to several aldehydes present in
cilantro. Cilantro preference is suspected to have a genetic component, yet to
date nothing is known about specific mechanisms. Here we present the results of
a genome-wide association study among 14,604 participants of European ancestry
who reported whether cilantro tasted soapy, with replication in a distinct set
of 11,851 participants who declared whether they liked cilantro. We find a
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) significantly associated with soapy-taste
detection that is confirmed in the cilantro preference group. This SNP,
rs72921001, (p=6.4e-9, odds ratio 0.81 per A allele) lies within a cluster of
olfactory receptor genes on chromosome 11. Among these olfactory receptor genes
is OR6A2, which has a high binding specificity for several of the aldehydes
that give cilantro its characteristic odor. We also estimate the heritability
of cilantro soapy-taste detection in our cohort, showing that the heritability
tagged by common SNPs is low, about 0.087. These results confirm that there is
a genetic component to cilantro taste perception and suggest that cilantro
dislike may stem from genetic variants in olfactory receptors. We propose that
OR6A2 may be the olfactory receptor that contributes to the detection of a
soapy smell from cilantro in European populations.

means of direct N-body integrations. A large fraction of residual gas was
probably expelled when the ONC formed, so we assume that the ONC was much more
compact when it formed compared to its current size, in agreement with the
embedded cluster radius-mass relation from Marks & Kroupa (2012). Hence, we
assume that few-body relaxation played an important role during the initial
phase of evolution of the ONC. In particular, three body interactions among OB
stars likely led to their ejection from the cluster and, at the same time, to
the formation of a massive object via runaway physical stellar collisions. The
resulting depletion of the high mass end of the stellar mass function in the
cluster is one of the important points where our models fit the observational
data. We speculate that the runaway-mass star may have collapsed directly into
a massive black hole (Mbh > 100Msun). Such a dark object could explain the
large velocity dispersion of the four Trapezium stars observed in the ONC core.
We further show that the putative massive black hole is likely to be a member
of a binary system with appr. 70 per cent probability. In such a case, it could
be detected either due to short periods of enhanced accretion of stellar winds
from the secondary star during pericentre passages, or through a measurement of
the motion of the secondary whose velocity would exceed 10 km/s along the whole

accommodated within the scale-invariant NMSSM in a way that is natural in all
respects, i.e., not only is the stop mass and hence its loop contribution to
Higgs mass of natural size, but we do not allow significant tuning of NMSSM
parameters as well. We pursue as much as possible an analytic approach which
gives clear insights on various ways to accommodate such a Higgs mass, while
conducting complementary numerical analyses. We consider both scenarios with
singlet-like state being heavier and lighter than SM-like Higgs. With A-terms
being small, we find for the NMSSM to be perturbative up to GUT scale, it is
not possible to get 125 GeV Higgs mass, which is true even if we tune
parameters of NMSSM. If we allow some of the couplings to become
non-perturbative below the GUT scale, then the non-tuned option implies that
the singlet self-coupling, kappa, is larger than the singlet-Higgs coupling,
lambda, which itself is order 1. This leads to a Landau pole for these
couplings close to the weak scale, in particular below ~10^4 TeV. In both the
perturbative and non-perturbative NMSSM, allowing large A_lambda, A_kappa gives
""more room"" to accommodate a 125 GeV Higgs, but a tuning of these A-terms may
be needed. In our analysis we also conduct a careful study of the constraints
on the parameter space from requiring global stability of the desired vacuum
fitting a 125 GeV Higgs, which is complementary to existing literature. In
particular, as the singlet-Higgs coupling lambda increases, vacuum stability
becomes more serious of an issue.

(dSph) satellite galaxy Andromeda II (And II) based on Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy
of 531 red giant branch stars. Our kinematical sample is among the largest for
any M31 satellite and extends out to two effective radii (r_eff = 5.3' = 1.1
kpc). We find a mean systemic velocity of -192.4+-0.5 km/s and an average
velocity dispersion of sigma_v = 7.8+-1.1 km/s. While the rotation velocity
along the major axis of And II is nearly zero (<1 km/s), the rotation along the
minor axis is significant with a maximum rotational velocity of v_max=8.6+-1.8
km/s. We find a kinematical major axis, with a maximum rotational velocity of
v_max=10.9+-2.4 km/s, misaligned by 67 degrees to the isophotal major axis. And
II is thus the first dwarf galaxy with evidence for nearly prolate rotation
with a v_max/sigma_v = 1.1, although given its ellipticity of epsilon = 0.10,
this object may be triaxial. We measured metallicities for a subsample of our
data, finding a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = -1.39+- 0.03 dex and an internal
metallicity dispersion of 0.72+-0.03 dex. We find a radial metallicity gradient
with metal-rich stars more centrally concentrated, but do not observe a
significant difference in the dynamics of two metallicity populations. And II
is the only known dwarf galaxy to show minor axis rotation making it a unique
system whose existence offers important clues on the processes responsible for
the formation of dSphs.

new scalar, vector and tensor fields, meaning that it is not restricted to
simple models based solely on cosmological scalar fields. A direct
correspondence is maintained between the parameterization and the underlying
space of theories, which allows us to build up a `dictionary' of modified

construction of the parameterization and demonstrate its use through a number
of worked examples relevant to the current literature. We indicate how the

the neutral gas, as detected in quasar absorption lines. We find that the high
column density regime probed by Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) and Lyman Limit

produces spurious artefacts in large halos in the form of gaseous clumps,
boosting the LLS cross-section. Furthermore, it forms halos with denser central
baryonic cores than AREPO, which leads to a substantially greater DLA
cross-section from smaller halos. AREPO thus produces a significantly lower
cumulative abundance of DLAs, which is intriguingly in much closer agreement
with observations. The column density function, however, is not altered enough
to significantly reduce the discrepancy with the observed value. For the low
column density gas probed by the Lyman-alpha forest, the codes differ only at
the level of a few percent, suggesting that this regime is quite well described
by both methods, a fact that is reassuring for the many Lyman-alpha studies
carried out with SPH thus far. While the residual differences are smaller than
the errors on current Lyman-alpha forest data, we note that this will likely
change for future precision experiments.

neutralino (ii) a 200 GeV Wino and (iii) a 1 TeV heavier particle annihilating
into leptons. For each DM candidate we assume two values for the thermally
averaged annihilation cross section \sigma v, the standard thermal value \sigma
v_th = 3 x 10^-26 cm^3 s^-1 and the maximum value allowed by WMAP7 data, \sigma
v_max. We include the enhancement of DM annihilations due to collapsed
structures, detailed estimates of energy deposition into the intergalactic
medium (IGM), as well realistic prescriptions for astrophysical sources of UV
and X-ray radiation. In these models, the additional heat input from DM
annihilation suppresses the mean 21cm brightness temperature offset by \delta
Tb ~ few-100 mK. In particular, the very deep \delta Tb ~ -150 mK absorption
feature at ~20 < z < 25 predicted by popular models of the first galaxies is
considerably reduced or totally erased by some of the considered DM candidates.
Such an enhancement in IGM heating could come from either DM annihilations or a
stronger-than-expected astrophysical component (i.e. abundant early X-ray
sources). However, we find that the two signatures are not degenerate, since
the DM heating is dominated by halos several orders of magnitude smaller than
those hosting galaxies, whose fractional abundance evolves more slowly
resulting in a smaller gradient: d \delta Tb/d \nu < 4 mK/MHz in the range \nu
~60-80 MHz. The detection of such signals by future radio telescopes would be
clear evidence of DM energy injection at high-redshifts.

further sensitivity to theoretical biases in the host potential. The

of asymmetries in the circumstellar envelopes of a small fraction of asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) stars. Although there is no general consensus for their
origin, a binary companion star may be responsible. Within this framework, we
investigate the gravitational effects associated with a sufficiently wide
binary system, where Roche lobe overflow is unimportant, on the outflowing
envelopes of AGB stars using three dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. The
effects due to individual binary components are separately studied, enabling
investigation of the stellar and circumstellar characteristics in detail. The
reflex motion of the AGB star alters the wind velocity distribution, thereby,
determining the overall shape of the outflowing envelope. On the other hand,
the interaction of the companion with the envelope produces a gravitational
wake, which exhibits a vertically thinner shape. The two patterns overlap and
form clumpy structures. To illustrate the diversity of shapes, we present the
numerical results as a function of inclination angle. Not only is spiral
structure produced by the binary interaction, but arc patterns are also found
that represent the former structure when viewed at different inclinations. The
arcs reveal a systematic shift of their centers of curvature for cases when the
orbital speed of the AGB star is comparable to its wind speed. They take on the
shape of a peanut for inclinations nearly edge-on. In the limit of slow orbital
motion of the AGB star relative to the wind speed, the arc pattern becomes
nearly spherically symmetric. We find that the aspect ratio of the overall
oblate shape of the pattern is an important diagnostic probe of the binary as
it can be used to constrain the orbital velocity of the AGB star, and moreover
the binary mass ratio.

asymmetries, and radiative cooling are studied. Rotation provides support
against fast collapse, but non-axisymmetric modes develop and efficiently
transport angular momentum outward, forming a circumplanetary disc. This
transport helps the clump reach the dynamical collapse phase, resulting from
molecular hydrogen dissociation, on a thousand-year timescale, which is smaller
than timescales predicted by some previous spherical 1D collapse models.
Extrapolation to the threshold of the runaway hydrogen dissociation indicates
that the collapse timescales can be shorter than inward migration timescales,

are subject to the mechanical forces due to scattering of cavity photons. We
show that the interplay of these interactions can give rise to bistable
equilibrium configurations, into which the chain can be cooled by
cavity-enhanced photon scattering. We characterize the resulting equilibrium
structures by determining the stationary state in the semiclassical limit for
both cavity field and crystal motion. The mean occupation of the vibrational
modes at steady state is evaluated, showing that the vibrational modes coupled
to the cavity can be simultaneously cooled to low occupation numbers. It is
also found that at steady state the vibrations are entangled with the cavity

different densities, we find empirical evidence, at the >97% confidence level,
for a change in the PPD radius distribution at ambient stellar densities \Sigma

truncation of PPDs or planetary systems by dynamical encounters. If this
agreement is causal, the ongoing disruption of PPDs and planetary systems
limits the possible existence of planets in the habitable zone, with shorter
lifetimes at higher host stellar masses and ambient densities. Therefore,
habitable planets are not likely to be present in long-lived stellar clusters,
and may have been ejected altogether to form a population of unbound,
free-floating planets. We conclude that, while highly suggestive, our results
should be verified through other methods. Our simple model shows that
truncations should lead to a measurable depletion of the PPD mass function that
can be detected with ALMA observations of the densest nearby and young

the available communication resources. Coordinated resource allocation is the
key to efficient performance, but the demand on backhaul signaling and

subcarriers. To handle this, we propose a novel multicell framework with
dynamic cooperation clusters where each terminal is jointly served by a small
set of base stations. Each base station coordinates interference to neighboring
terminals only, thus limiting backhaul signalling and making the framework
scalable. This framework can describe anything from interference channels to
ideal joint multicell transmission.
  The resource allocation (i.e., precoding and scheduling) is formulated as an
optimization problem (P1) with performance described by arbitrary monotonic
functions of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs) and arbitrary
linear power constraints. Although (P1) is non-convex and difficult to solve
optimally, we are able to prove: 1) Optimality of single-stream beamforming; 2)
Conditions for full power usage; and 3) A precoding parametrization based on a
few parameters between zero and one. These optimality properties are used to
propose low-complexity strategies: both a centralized scheme and a distributed
version that only requires local channel knowledge and processing. We evaluate
the performance on measured multicell channels and observe that the proposed
strategies achieve close-to-optimal performance among centralized and
distributed solutions, respectively. In addition, we show that multicell
interference coordination can give substantial improvements in sum performance,

that some terminals can experience performance degradations.

The
lensed source (z=0.575) of this system has a complex morphology with several
subcomponents. Its subcomponents span a radial range from 4 to 10kpc in the
lens plane. Therefore we can constrain the slope of the total projected mass
profile around the Einstein radius (R_E) from lensing alone. We measure a
density profile that is slightly but not significantly shallower than
isothermal at R_E. We decompose the mass of the lensing galaxy into a de
Vaucouleurs (deV) component to trace the stars and an additional dark
component. The spread of multiple image components over a large radial range
also allows us to determine the amplitude of the deV and dark matter components
separately. We get a mass to light ratio of M_deV/L_B~5.5\pm1.5M/L_sun,B and a
dark matter fraction within R_E of ~20 to 40%. Modelling the star formation
history assuming composite stellar populations at solar metallicity to the
galaxy's photometry yields a mass to light ratio of
M_star,salp/L_B~4.0_{-1.3}^{+0.6}M/L_sun,B and
M_star,chab/L_B~2.3_{-0.8}^{+0.3}M/L_sun,B for Salpeter and Chabrier IMFs,
respectively. Hence, the mass to light ratio derived from lensing is more
Salpeter-like, in agreement with results for massive Coma galaxies and other
nearby massive early type galaxies. We examine the consequences of the galaxy
group in which the lensing galaxy is embedded, showing that it has little
influence on the mass to light ratio obtained for the deV component of the
lensing galaxy. Finally, we decompose the projected, azimuthally averaged 2D
density distribution of the deV and dark matter component of the lensing signal
into spherically averaged 3D density profiles. We can show that the 3D dark and
luminous matter density within R_E~0.6R_eff of this SLACS galaxy is similar to
the values of Coma galaxies with the same velocity dispersions.

fixed area and a fixed enclosed volume locally deformed by external normal
forces bringing two nearby points on the surface together symmetrically. The
conformal invariance of the two-dimensional bending energy is used to identify
the distribution of energy as well as the stress established in the vesicle.
While these states are local minima of the energy, this energy is degenerate;
there is a zero mode in the energy fluctuation spectrum, associated with area
and volume preserving conformal transformations, which breaks the symmetry
between the two points. The volume constraint fixes the distance $S$, measured
along the surface, between the two points; if it is relaxed, a second zero mode
appears, reflecting the independence of the energy on $S$; in the absence of
this constraint a pathway opens for the membrane to slip out of the defect.
Logarithmic curvature singularities in the surface geometry at the points of
contact signal the presence of external forces. The magnitude of these forces
varies inversely with $S$ and so diverges as the points merge; the
corresponding torques vanish in these defects. The geometry behaves near each
of the singularities as a biharmonic monopole, in the region between them as a
surface of constant mean curvature, and in distant regions as a biharmonic
quadrupole. Comparison of the distribution of stress with the quadratic
approximation in the height functions points to shortcomings of the latter
representation. Radial tension is accompanied by lateral compression, both near
the singularities and far away, with a crossover from tension to compression
occurring in the region between them.

Abell 520 has been seen as a possible exception. We revisit A520 presenting new

detect the previously claimed ""dark core"" that contains excess mass with no
significant galaxy overdensity at the location of the X-ray plasma. This peak
has been suggested to be indicative of a large self-interaction cross-section
for dark matter (at least ~5 sigma larger than the upper limit of 0.7 cm^2/g

of dust on UV luminosity can be dramatic, our model includes a self-consistent
computation of dust attenuation based on a radiative transfer model. We find
that intrinsically brighter galaxies suffer stronger dust attenuation than
fainter ones, though the relation has a large scatter. The model predicts
galaxies with UV colours consistent with the colour selection regions designed
to select LBGs in observational surveys. We find that the drop-out technique
that selects LBGs based on two rest-frame UV colours is robust and effective,
selecting more than 70 per cent of UV bright galaxies at a given redshift. We
investigate the impact on the predicted UV colours of varying selected model
parameters. We find that the UV colours are most sensitive to the modelling of
dust attenuation and in particular, to the extinction curve used in the
radiative transfer calculation. If we assume a Milky Way dust extinction curve,
the predicted UV continuum slopes are, in general, bluer than observed.
However, we find that the opposite is true when using the Small Magellanic
Cloud dust extinction curve. This demonstrates the strong dependence of UV
colours on dust properties and highlights the inadequacy of using the UV
continuum slope as a tracer of dust attenuation without any further knowledge
of the galaxy inclination or dust characteristics in high redshift galaxies.

observed with the Swift XRT and UVOT instruments, allowing studies of the
gradual shift of the peak of the SED from UV to X-rays, time scales to the
onset and duration of the X-ray brightest supersoft source (SSS) phase, and
pre- and post-SSS X-ray emission. In addition, XMM-Newton and Chandra
observations can efficiently be scheduled, allowing deeper studies of
strategically chosen evolutionary stages. Before Swift joined in 2005, Chandra

underexposed observations taken before and/or after the SSS phase. More
systematic Swift studies reduced this number while increasing the number of
novae. Pre- and post-SSS spectra at low and high spectral resolution were
successfully modelled with collisional plasma models. Pre-SSS emission arises
in shocks and post-SSS emission in radiatively cooling thin ejecta. In

radiation transport models give only approximate reproduction of the

area the last decade. However, the deployment of a commercial CR network is yet
to emerge. A large portion of the existing literature does not build on real
world scenarios, hence, neglecting various important interactions of the
research with commercial telecommunication networks. For instance, a lot of
attention has been paid to spectrum sensing as the front line functionality
that needs to be completed in an efficient and accurate manner to enable an
opportunistic CR network architecture. This is necessary to detect the
existence of spectrum holes without which no other procedure can be fulfilled.
However, simply sensing (cooperatively or not) the energy received from a
primary transmitter cannot enable correct dynamic spectrum access. For example,
the low strength of a primary transmitter's signal does not assure that there
will be no interference to a nearby primary receiver. In addition, the presence
of a primary transmitter's signal does not mean that CR network users cannot
access the spectrum since there might not be any primary receiver in the
vicinity. Despite the existing elegant and clever solutions to the DSA problem
no robust, implementable scheme has emerged. In this paper, we challenge the
basic premises of the proposed schemes. We further argue that addressing the
technical challenges we face in deploying robust CR networks can only be
achieved if we radically change the way we design their basic functionalities.
In support of our argument, we present a set of real-world scenarios, inspired
by realistic settings in commercial telecommunications networks, focusing on
spectrum sensing as a basic and critical functionality in the deployment of
CRs. We use these scenarios to show why existing DSA paradigms are not amenable
to realistic deployment in complex wireless environments.

valid both for bound states and resonances. One of the goals of this paper is
to draw attention on the possibility to use the Coulomb renormalized ANCs

accretion disc in U CrB. Observations of circumstellar gas surrounding the mass
donor in RS Vul suggest magnetic effects could be responsible for deflecting
the accretion stream out of the orbital plane, resulting in a tilted disc. To
determine whether a tilted disc is possible due to a deflected stream, we use
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of the mass transfer process in RS
Vul. By deflecting the stream 45 degrees out of the orbital plane and boosting
the magnitude of the stream's velocity to Mach 30, we mimic the effects of
magnetic activity near L1. We find that the modified stream parameters change
the direct-impact nature of the system. The stream misses the surface of the
star, and a slightly warped accretion disc forms with no more than 3 degrees of
disc tilt. The stream-disc interaction for the deflected stream forces a large
degree of material above the orbital plane, increasing the out-of-plane flow
drastically. Plotting the H-alpha emissivity in velocity space allows us to
compare our results with tomographic observations. Deflecting and boosting the
stream increases the emissivity in each z-velocity slice of the out-of-plane
flow by at least three and up to eight orders of magnitude compared to the
undeflected case. We conclude that a deflected stream is a viable mechanism for
producing the strong out-of-plane flows seen in the tomographic images of U CrB

argue for a Debye spectrum at low frequencies for dimensions higher than one,

exponentially small critical frequency. The structure of the modes reflects a
divergent percolation length that arises from the disorder in the springs

assumed phase-aligned (coherent) transmissions from different base transceiver

noncoherent cooperative transmission scheme for the downlink is studied, which
does not require phase alignment. The focus is on jointly serving two users in
adjacent cells sharing the same resource block. The two BTSs partially share
their messages through a backhaul link, and each BTS transmits a superposition
of two codewords, one for each receiver. Each receiver decodes its own message,
and treats the signals for the other receiver as background noise. With
narrowband transmissions the achievable rate region and maximum achievable
weighted sum rate are characterized by optimizing the power allocation (and the
beamforming vectors in the case of multiple transmit antennas) at each BTS
between its two codewords. For a wideband (multicarrier) system, a dual
formulation of the optimal power allocation problem across sub-carriers is
presented, which can be efficiently solved by numerical methods. Results show
that the proposed cooperation scheme can improve the sum rate substantially in
the low to moderate signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range.

buffer-aided link adaptive relaying, the state of the source-relay and
relay-destination channels determines whether the source or the relay is
selected for transmission. Our objective is to maximize the system throughput
over a finite number of transmission time slots for both relaying protocols. In
case of conventional relaying, we propose an offline and several online joint
source and relay transmit power allocation schemes. For offline power
allocation, we formulate an optimization problem which can be solved optimally.
For the online case, we propose a dynamic programming (DP) approach to compute
the optimal online transmit power. To alleviate the complexity inherent to DP,
we also propose several suboptimal online power allocation schemes. For
buffer-aided link adaptive relaying, we show that the joint offline
optimization of the source and relay transmit powers along with the link
selection results in a mixed integer non-linear program which we solve
optimally using the spatial branch-and-bound method. We also propose an
efficient online power allocation scheme and a naive online power allocation
scheme for buffer-aided link adaptive relaying. Our results show that link
adaptive relaying provides performance improvement over conventional relaying
at the expense of a higher computational complexity.

cluster is also detected as an extended X-ray source in the RASS. It hosts a
large bright 1.9 Mpc radio relic, an elongated ~2 Mpc radio halo, and two
smaller radio relics. The large radio relic has a peculiar linear morphology.
For this relic we observe a clear spectral index gradient, in the direction
towards the cluster center. We performed Rotation Measure (RM) Synthesis
between 1.2 and 1.7 GHz. The results suggest that for the west part of the
large relic some of the Faraday rotation is caused by ICM and is not only due
to galactic foregrounds. We also carried out a detailed spectral analysis of
this radio relic and created radio color-color diagrams. We find (i) an
injection spectral index of -0.6 to -0.7, (ii) steepening spectral index and
increasing spectral curvature in the post-shock region, and (iii) an overall
power-law spectrum between 74 MHz and 4.9 GHz with \alpha=-1.10 \pm 0.02.
Mixing of emission in the beam from regions with different spectral ages is
probably the dominant factor that determines the shape of the radio spectra.
Changes in the magnetic field, total electron content, or adiabatic
gains/losses do not play a major role. A model in which particles are
(re)accelerated in a first order Fermi process at the front of the relic
provides the best match to the observed spectra. We speculate that in the
post-shock region particles are re-accelerated by merger induced turbulence to
form the radio halo as the relic and halo are connected. The 1RXS J0603.3+4214
merger is probably more complex than the ""simple'"" binary merger events that
are thought to give rise to symmetric double radio relics.

successor concepts (ambiguity as situations with unknown probabilities), and
one based on decision-making over a set of menus of potential future

spacetime conservation-element and solution-element (CESE) scheme, is designed
to focus on the magnetic-field evolution and to consider a simplified solar
atomsphere with finite plasma $\beta$. Magnetic vector-field data derived from
the observations at the photoshpere is inputted directly to constrain the
model. Assuming that the dynamic evolution of the coronal magnetic field can be
approximated by successive equilibria, we solve a time sequence of MHD
equilibria basing on a set of vector magnetograms for AR 11117 taken by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the {\it Solar Dynamic
Observatory (SDO)} around the time of flare. The model qualitatively reproduces
the basic structures of the 3D magnetic field, as supported by the visual
similarity between the field lines and the coronal loops observed by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), which shows that the coronal field can
indeed be well characterized by the MHD equilibrium in most time. The magnetic
configuration changes very limited during the studied time interval of two
hours. A topological analysis reveals that the small flare is correlated with a
bald patch (BP, where the magnetic field is tangent to the photoshpere),
suggesting that the energy release of the flare can be understood by magnetic
reconnection associated with the BP separatrices. The total magnetic flux and
energy keep increasing slightly in spite of the flare, while the computed
magnetic free energy drops during the flare with an amount of $\sim 10^{30}$
erg, which seems to be adequate to provide the energy budget of the minor

reliably identified with their solar sources in the central part of the disk.
Using the SOHO/EIT 195 A images and MDI magnetograms, we select significant
dimming and arcade areas and calculate summarized unsigned magnetic fluxes in
these regions at the photospheric level. The high relevance of this eruption
parameter is displayed by its pronounced correlation with the Forbush decrease
(FD) magnitude, which, unlike GMSs, does not depend on the sign of the Bz
component but is determined by global characteristics of ICMEs. Correlations
with the same magnetic flux in the solar source region are found for the GMS
intensity (at the first step, without taking into account factors determining
the Bz component near the Earth), as well as for the temporal intervals between
the solar eruptions and the GMS onset and peak times. The larger the magnetic
flux, the stronger the FD and GMS intensities are and the shorter the ICME
transit time is. The revealed correlations indicate that the main quantitative
characteristics of major non-recurrent space weather disturbances are largely
determined by measurable parameters of solar eruptions, in particular, by the
magnetic flux in dimming areas and arcades, and can be tentatively estimated in
advance with a lead time from 1 to 4 days. For GMS intensity, the revealed
dependencies allow one to estimate a possible value, which can be expected if
the Bz component is negative.

substantially improving over standard band-structure methods. Analyzing the
QSGW self-energy we discuss non-local and dynamic contributions to effective
masses. We present evidence that the two contributions are mostly separable,
since the quasi-particle weight is found to be essentially independent of
momentum. The main effect of non locality is captured by the static but
non-local QSGW effective potential. Moreover, these non-local self-energy
corrections, absent in e.g. dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), can be
relatively large. We show, on the other hand, that QSGW only partially accounts
for dynamic renormalizations at low energies. These findings suggest that QSGW
combined with DMFT will capture most of the many-body physics in the iron

out to z~7, we describe a simple model for the star formation rate density
function at high redshift based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism. This
model postulates a starburst following each major merger, lasting for a time
t_SF and converting at most f_star of galactic gas into stars. We include a
simple physical prescription for supernovae feedback that suppresses star
formation in low mass galaxies. Constraining t_SF and f_star to describe the
observed star formation rate density at high redshifts, we find that individual
starbursts were terminated after a time t_SF~10^7 years. This is comparable to
the main-sequence lifetimes of supernova progenitors, indicating that high
redshift starbursts are quenched once supernovae feedback had time to develop.
High redshift galaxies convert ~10% of their mass into stars for galaxies with
star formation rates above ~1 solar mass per year, but a smaller fraction for
lower luminosity galaxies. Our best fit model successfully predicts the
observed relation between star formation rate and stellar mass at z>~4, while
our deduced relation between stellar mass and halo mass is also consistent with
data on the dwarf satellites of the Milky Way. We find that supernovae feedback
lowers the efficiency of star formation in the lowest mass galaxies and makes
their contribution to reionization small. As a result, photo-ionization
feedback on low mass galaxy formation does not significantly affect the
reionization history. Using a semi-analytic model for the reionization history,
we infer that approximately half of the ionizing photons needed to complete
reionization have already been observed in star-forming galaxies.

electromagnetic spectrum, the intensities are usually calculated within the
dipole approximation, which assumes that the oscillating electric field is
constant over the whole molecule. For the short wavelengths used in X-ray
spectroscopy, this dipole approximation breaks down and it becomes necessary to
include higher-order contributions. In quantum-chemical approaches to X-ray
spectroscopy, these so-called quadrupole intensities have so far been
calculated by including contributions depending on the square of the
electric-quadrupole and magnetic-dipole transition moments. However, the
resulting quadrupole intensities depend on the choice of the origin of the
coordinate system. Here, we show that for obtaining an origin-independent
theory, one has to include all contributions that are of the same order in the
wave vector consistently. This leads to two additional contributions depending
on products of the electric-dipole and electric-octupole and of the
electric-dipole and magnetic-quadrupole transition moments, respectively. We
have implemented such an origin-independent calculation of quadrupole

diffusion is important for interpreting the need for in situ large scale
dynamos in astrophysics and for observationally inferring field strengths
compared to kinetic energy. By solving coupled equations for magnetic energy
and magnetic helicity in a system initiated with isotropic turbulence and an
arbitrarily helical large scale field, we quantify the decay rate of the latter
for a bounded or periodic system. The energy associated with the non-helical
magnetic field rapidly decays by turbulent diffusion, but the decay rate of the
helical component depends on whether the ratio of its magnetic energy to the
turbulent kinetic energy exceeds a critical value given by M_{1,c}
=(k_1/k_2)^2, where k_1 and k_2 are the wave numbers of the large and forcing
scales. Turbulently diffusing helical fields to small scales while conserving
magnetic helicity requires a rapid increase in total magnetic energy. As such,
only when the helical fields are sub-critical can they so diffuse. When
super-critical, the large scale helical field decays slowly, at a rate
determined by microphysical dissipation even when macroscopic turbulence is
present. Amplification of small scale magnetic helicity abates the turbulent
diffusion. Two implications are that: (1) Standard arguments supporting the
need for in situ large scale dynamos based on the otherwise rapid turbulent
diffusion of large scale fields require re-thinking since only the non-helical
field is so diffused in a closed system. Boundary terms could however provide
potential pathways for rapid change of the large scale helical field. (2) Since
M_{1,c} <<1 for k_1 << k_2, the presence of long-lived ordered large scale
helical fields, as in extragalactic jets, does not guarantee that the magnetic
field dominates the kinetic energy.

of the cyclotron motion gives rise to a well-known self-similar fractal
structure of the energy eigenvalue, known as the Hofstadter butterfly, for an
electron moving in lattice under magnetic field. Evolving from the $n=0$ Landau
level, the central band of the Hofstadter butterfly is especially interesting
since it may hold a key to the mysteries of the fractional quantum Hall effect
observed in graphene. While the entire Hofstadter butterfly can be in principle
obtained by solving Harper's equations numerically, the weak-field limit, most
relevant for experiment, is intractable due to the fact that the size of the
Hamiltonian matrix, that needs to be diagonalized, diverges. In this paper, we
develop an effective Hamiltonian method that can be used to provide an accurate
analytic description of the central Hofstadter band in the weak-field regime.
One of the most important discoveries obtained in this work is that massless
Dirac particles always exist inside the central Hofstadter band no matter how
small the magnetic flux may become. In other words, with its bandwidth
broadened by the lattice effect, the $n=0$ Landau level contains massless Dirac
particles within itself. In fact, by carefully analyzing the self-similar
recursive pattern of the central Hofstadter band, we conclude that massless
Dirac particles should occur under arbitrary magnetic field. As a corollary,
the central Hofstadter band also contains a self-similar structure of recursive
Landau levels associated with such massless Dirac particles. To assess the
experimental feasibility of observing massless Dirac particles inside the
central Hofstadter band, we compute the width of the central Hofstadter band as
a function of magnetic field in the weak-field regime.

is to make specifications stable, i.e., to ensure that they cannot be

specifications: instead of describing method behaviour in terms of the object's
state, we specify it in terms of the object's state history. A history is
defined as a list of state updates, which at all points can be related to the
actual object's state.
  We illustrate the approach on the BlockingQueue hierarchy from the
java.util.concurrent library. We show how the behaviour of the interface
BlockingQueue is specified, leaving a few decisions open to descendant classes.
The classes implementing the interface correctly inherit the specifications. As
a specification language, we use a combination of JML and permission-based
separation logic, including abstract predicates. This results in an abstract,
modular and natural way to specify the behaviour of concurrent queues. The
specifications can be used to derive high-level properties about queues, for
example to show that the order of elements is preserved. Moreover, the approach
can be easily adapted to other concurrent data structures.

fractionation arose assumes that CO self-shielding produced 16O-rich CO and
16O-poor H2O, where the H2O subsequently combined with interstellar dust to
form relatively 16O-poor solids within the Solar Nebula. Another model for
creating the different reservoirs of 16O-rich gas and 16O-poor solids suggests
that these reservoirs were produced by Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) if the
Solar System dust component was somewhat younger than the gas component and
both components were lying on the line of slope one in the O three-isotope

the oxygen isotopes in the Solar System. The GCE scenario is in contradiction
with observations of the 18O/17O ratios in nearby molecular clouds and young
stellar objects. It is very unlikely for GCE to produce a line of slope one

interstellar medium. Furthermore, the assumption that the Solar System dust was
younger than the gas requires unusual timescales or the existence of an
important stardust component that is not theoretically expected to occur nor

basic, but critical, questions regarding the cosmological significance of

of different cosmological volumes with various Gaussian and non-Gaussian
models, we self-consistently relate the cosmic star formation rate density to
the corresponding GRB rate. Assuming that GRBs are fair tracers of cosmic star
formation, we find that positive local non-Gaussianities, described in terms of
the non-linear parameter, \fnl, might boost significantly the GRB rate at high
redshift, $z \gg 6$. Deviations with respect to the Gaussian case account for a
few orders of magnitude if \fnl$\sim 1000$, one order of magnitude for
\fnl$\sim 100$, and a factor of $\sim 2$ for \fnl$\sim 50$. These differences
are found only at large redshift, while at later times the rates tend to
converge. Furthermore, a comparison between our predictions and the observed
GRB data at $z > 6$ allows to exclude large negative \fnl, consistently with
previous works. Future detections of any long GRB at extremely high redshift
($z\sim 15-20$) could favor non-Gaussian scenarios with positive \fnl. More
stringent constraints require much larger high-$z$ GRB complete samples,
currently not available in literature. By distinguishing the contributions to
the GRB rate from the metal-poor population III regime, and the metal-enriched
population II-I regime, we conclude that the latter is a more solid tracer of
the underlying matter distribution, while the former is strongly dominated by
feedback mechanisms from the first, massive, short-lived stars, rather than by
possible non-Gaussian fluctuations. This holds quite independently of the
assumed population III initial mass function.

strong-line diagnostic employed. Our large sample size demonstrates that there
is significant intrinsic scatter around this abundance gradient, as much as 3
times the systematic uncertainty in the strong line diagnostics. The intrinsic
scatter is similar in the nitrogen abundances, although the gradient is
significantly steeper. On small scales (deprojected distance < 0.5 kpc), HII
regions exhibit local variations in oxygen abundance that are larger than 0.3
dex in 33% of neighboring pairs. We do not identify a significant oxygen

photomultiplier sensor arrays capable of sensing individual photons. Combined
with high-frequency time-to-digital converters (TDCs), this technology opens up
the prospect of sensors capable of recording with high accuracy both the time
and location of each detected photon. Such a capability could lead to
significant improvements in imaging accuracy, especially for applications
operating with low photon fluxes such as LiDAR and positron emission
tomography.
  The demands placed on on-chip readout circuitry imposes stringent trade-offs
between fill factor and spatio-temporal resolution, causing many contemporary
designs to severely underutilize the technology's full potential. Concentrating
on the low photon flux setting, this paper leverages results from group testing
and proposes an architecture for a highly efficient readout of pixels using
only a small number of TDCs, thereby also reducing both cost and power
consumption. The design relies on a multiplexing technique based on binary
interconnection matrices. We provide optimized instances of these matrices for
various sensor parameters and give explicit upper and lower bounds on the
number of TDCs required to uniquely decode a given maximum number of
simultaneous photon arrivals.
  To illustrate the strength of the proposed architecture, we note a typical
digitization result of a 120x120 photodiode sensor on a 30um x 30um pitch with
a 40ps time resolution and an estimated fill factor of approximately 70%, using
only 161 TDCs. The design guarantees registration and unique recovery of up to
4 simultaneous photon arrivals using a fast decoding algorithm. In a series of
realistic simulations of scintillation events in clinical positron emission
tomography the design was able to recover the spatio-temporal location of 98.6%
of all photons that caused pixel firings.

the magnetic field anchored to the solid crust of the star. Assuming that the
core field evolves on much longer timescales, the crustal field evolves mainly
though Ohmic dissipation and the Hall drift, and it may be subject to
relatively rapid changes with remarkable effects on the observed timing
properties. We investigate whether changes of the magnetic field structure and
strength during the star evolution may have observable consequences in the
braking index, which is the most sensitive quantity to reflect small variations
of the timing properties that are caused by magnetic field rearrangements. By
performing axisymmetric, long-term simulations of the magneto-thermal evolution
of neutron stars with state-of-the-art microphysical inputs, we find that the
effect of the magnetic field evolution on the braking index can be divided into
three qualitatively different stages depending on the age and the internal
temperature: a first stage that may be different for standard pulsars (with
n~3) or low field neutron stars that accreted fallback matter during the
supernova explosion (systematically n<3); in a second stage, the evolution is
governed by almost pure Ohmic field decay, and a braking index n>3 is expected;
in the third stage, at late times, when the interior temperature has dropped to
very low values, Hall oscillatory modes in the neutron star crust result in
braking indices of high absolute value and both positive and negative signs.
Models with strong (1e14 G) multipolar or toroidal components, even with a weak
(~1e12 G) dipolar field are consistent with the observed trend of the timing
properties.

effective solution to improve performance of information retrieval systems.
Relevance feedback refers to an interactive process that helps to improve the
retrieval performance. In this paper we propose the use of relevance feedback
to improve document image retrieval System (DIRS) performance. This paper
compares a variety of strategies for positive and negative feedback. In
addition, feature subspace is extracted and updated during the feedback process
using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and based on user's
feedback. That is, in addition to reducing the dimensionality of feature
spaces, a proper subspace for each type of features is obtained in the feedback
process to further improve the retrieval accuracy. Experiments show that using
relevance Feedback in DIR achieves better performance than common DIR.

expression change (plasticity) can alter gene function and influence
adaptation. A number of factors, such as transcription re-initiation, strong
chromatin regulation or genome neighboring organization, underlie this
coupling. However, these factors do not necessarily combine in equivalent ways
and strengths in all genes. Can we identify then alternative architectures that
modulate in distinct ways the linkage of noise and plasticity? Here we first
show that strong chromatin regulation, commonly viewed as a source of coupling,
can lead to plasticity without noise. The nature of this regulation is relevant
too, with plastic but noiseless genes being subjected to general activators
whereas plastic and noisy genes experience more specific repression.
Contrarily, in genes exhibiting poor transcriptional control, it is
translational efficiency what separates noise from plasticity, a pattern
related to transcript length. This additionally implies that genome neighboring
organization -as modifier- appears only effective in highly plastic genes. In
this class, we confirm bidirectional promoters (bipromoters) as a configuration
capable to reduce coupling by abating noise but also reveal an important
trade-off, since bipromoters also decrease plasticity. This presents ultimately
a paradox between intergenic distances and modulation, with short intergenic
distances both associated and disassociated to noise at different plasticity
levels. Balancing the coupling among different types of expression variability
appears as a potential shaping force of genome regulation and organization.
This is reflected in the use of different control strategies at genes with
different sets of functional constraints.

is investigated by means of direct numerical simulations. The focus is on
deviations from Richardson eddy-diffusivity model and in particular on the
strong fluctuations experienced by tracers. Evidence is obtained that the
distribution of distances attains an almost self-similar regime characterized
by a very weak intermittency. The timescale of convergence to this behavior is
found to be given by the kinetic energy dissipation time measured at the scale
of the initial separation. Conversely the velocity differences between tracers
are displaying a strongly anomalous behavior whose scaling properties are very
close to that of Lagrangian structure functions. These violent fluctuations are
interpreted geometrically and are shown to be responsible for a long-term
memory of the initial separation. Despite this strong intermittency, it is
found that the mixed moment defined by the ratio between the cube of the
longitudinal velocity difference and the distance attains a statistically
stationary regime on very short timescales. These results are brought together
to address the question of violent events in the distribution of distances. It
is found that distances much larger than the average are reached by pairs that
have always separated faster since the initial time. They contribute a
stretched exponential behavior in the tail of the inter-tracer distance
probability distribution. The tail approaches a pure exponential at large
times, contradicting Richardson diffusive approach. At the same time, the
distance distribution displays a time-dependent power-law behavior at very
small values, which is interpreted in terms of fractal geometry. It is argued
and demonstrated numerically that the exponent converges to one at large time,
again in conflict with Richardson's distribution.

  Counterfactuals",,,,,"q-fin.RM stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ex ante forecast outcomes should be interpreted as counterfactuals (potential
histories), with errors as the spread between outcomes. Reapplying measurements
of uncertainty about the estimation errors of the estimation errors of an
estimation leads to branching counterfactuals. Such recursions of epistemic
uncertainty have markedly different distributial properties from conventional
sampling error. Nested counterfactuals of error rates invariably lead to fat
tails, regardless of the probability distribution used, and to powerlaws under
some conditions. A mere .01% branching error rate about the STD (itself an
error rate), and .01% branching error rate about that error rate, etc.
(recursing all the way) results in explosive (and infinite) higher moments than
1. Missing any degree of regress leads to the underestimation of small
probabilities and concave payoffs (a standard example of which is Fukushima).
The paper states the conditions under which higher order rates of uncertainty
(expressed in spreads of counterfactuals) alters the shapes the of final
distribution and shows which a priori beliefs about conterfactuals are needed
to accept the reliability of conventional probabilistic methods (thin tails or
mildly fat tails).

events with one electron or muon and at least four jets in the final state,
collected by CMS in pp collisions at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV at the LHC. A total of
5174 candidate events is selected from data corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 5.0 inverse femtobarns. For each event the mass is reconstructed
from a kinematic fit of the decay products to a t t-bar hypothesis. The
top-quark mass is determined simultaneously with the jet energy scale (JES),
constrained by the known mass of the W boson in q anti-q decays, to be 173.49
+/- 0.43 (stat.+JES) +/- 0.98 (syst.) GeV.

to their high anisotropy, which results in extremely narrow, nano-sized domain
walls. As a result, the recently studied current-induced domain wall motion
(CIDWM) in these materials promises to enable a novel class of data, memory,
and logic devices. In this letter, we propose the spin Hall effect as a
radically new mechanism for CIDWM. We are able to carefully tune the net spin
Hall current in depinning experiments on Pt/Co/Pt nanowires, offering unique
control over CIDWM. Furthermore, we determine that the depinning efficiency is
intimately related to the internal structure of the domain wall, which we
control by small fields along the nanowire. This new manifestation of CIDWM
offers a very attractive new degree of freedom for manipulating domain wall
motion by charge currents, and sheds light on the existence of contradicting
reports on CIDWM in perpendicularly magnetized materials.

significantly important in deterring decision makers from expanding in the
generic pharmaceutical business. However, not all players are affected in the

the worse position. We have highlighted that the expected NPV and the number of
generics in the portfolio of a pharmaceutical lab are important variables, but
that it is also important to consider the degree of diversification. Labs with
a higher potential for diversification across markets have an advantage over
smaller labs. We have described a fuzzy decision support system based on the
Mamdani model in order to determine the incentives for a laboratory to remain

drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar sample. The quasar sample
has been separated into 1,692 radio-loud and 16,816 radio-quiet quasars (RLQs
and RQQs hereafter) matched in both redshift and i'-band absolute magnitude.
  We use the [O II]\lambda3726+3729 line as an indicator of star formation.
Based on these measurements we find evidence that star-formation activity is
higher in the RLQ population. The mean equivalent widths (EW) for [O II] are
EW([O II])_RL=7.80\pm0.30 \AA, and EW([O II])_RQ=4.77\pm0.06 \AA, for the RLQ
and RQQ samples respectively. The mean [O II] luminosities are \log[L([O

of RLQs and RQQs respectively. Finally, to overcome possible biases in the EW
measurements due to the continuum emission below the [O II] line being
contaminated by young stars in the host galaxy, we use the ratio of the [O II]
luminosity to rest-frame i'-band luminosity, in this case, we find for the RLQs
\log[L([O II])_RL/L_opt]=-3.89\pm0.01 and \log[L([O
II])_RQ/L_opt]=-4.011\pm0.004 for RQQs. However the results depend upon the
optical luminosity of the quasar. RLQs and RQQs with the same high optical
luminosity \log(L_opt/W)>38.6, tend to have the same level of [O II] emission.
On the other hand, at lower optical luminosities \log(L_opt/W)<38.6, there is a
clear [O II] emission excess for the RLQs. As an additional check of our
results we use the [O III] emission line as a tracer of the bolometric
accretion luminosity, instead of the i'-band absolute magnitude, and we obtain
similar results.
  Radio jets appear to be the main reason for the [O II] emission excess in the
case of RLQs. In contrast, we suggest AGN feedback ensures that the two
populations acquire the same [O II] emission at higher optical luminosities.

abelian bundle gerbes with connection over it. The construct admits a neat
interpretation in terms of a relative Cartan calculus associated with the
hierarchy of manifolds that compose the target space of the multiphase sigma
model. The paper also discusses at length the gauge anomaly for the rigid
symmetries, derived and quantified cohomologically in a previous work of
Gaw\c{e}dzki, Waldorf and the author. The ensuing reinterpretation of the small
gauge anomaly in terms of the twisted rel. Courant algebroid modelling the
Poisson algebra of Noether charges of the symmetries is elucidated through an
equivalence between a category built from data of the gauged sigma model and
that of principal bundles over the worldsheet with a structural action groupoid
based on the target space. Finally, the large gauge anomaly is identified with
the obstruction to the existence of topological defect networks implementing
the action of the gauge group of the gauged sigma model and those giving a
local trivialisation of a gauge bundle of an arbitrary topology over the

this SC phase is structurally unstable by exhibiting severely imaginary
phonons, and is energetically unstable with respect to a theoretical
body-centered tetragonal I41/amd structure over the pressure range of phase
III. These calculations generated extensive debates on the validity of SC
phase. Here we have re-examined the SC structure by performing more precise
density functional calculations within hybrid functionals of
Heyd-Scuseria-Erhzerhof (HSE) and PBE0. Our calculations were able to
rationalize fundamentally the phase stability of SC structure over all other
known phases by evidence of its actual energetic stability above 33 GPa and its
intrinsically dynamical stability without showing any imaginary phonons in the
entire pressure range studied. We further established that the long-thought
theoretical I41/amd structure remains stable in a narrow pressure range before
entering SC phase and is actually the structure of experimental Ca-III'
synthesized recently at low temperature 14 K as supported by the excellent
agreement between our simulated X-ray diffraction patterns and the experimental

electron exchange energy in a proper description of the potential energy of Ca.

Point Source Catalog (2MASS PSC). The CDs are bimodal, which has a red peak at
0.8 < J-Ks < 0.85 and a blue peak at 0.3 < J-Ks < 0.4. The colors of the red
peak are more or less the same for the whole sky, but that of the blue peak
depend on Galactic latitude, (J-Ks ~ 0.35 at low Galactic latitudes and 0.35 <
J-Ks < 0.4 for other sky areas). The blue peak dominates the bimodal CDs at low
Galactic latitudes and becomes comparable with the red peak in other sky
regions. In order to explain the bimodal distribution and the global trend
shown by the all sky 2MASS CDs, we assemble an empirical HR diagram, which is
composed by observational-based near infrared HR diagrams and color magnitude
diagrams, and incorporate a Milky Way model. In the empirical HR diagram, the
main sequence stars turnoff the thin disk is relatively bluer, (J-Ks)0 = 0.31,
when we compare with the thick disk which is (J-Ks)0 = 0.39. The age of the
thin/thick disk is roughly estimated to be around 4-5/8-9 Gyr according to the
color-age relation of the main sequence turnoff. In general, the 2MASS CDs can
be treated as a tool to census the age of stellar population of the Milky Way
in a statistical manner and to our knowledge this is a first attempt to measure
the age.

which incorporates sentiment content (i.e., degree of positive or negative
sentiment) of the words being compared to measure the similarity between them.
The proposed metric is based on the hypothesis that knowing the sentiment is
beneficial in measuring the similarity. To verify this hypothesis, we measure
and compare the annotator agreement for 2 annotation strategies: 1) sentiment
information of a pair of words is considered while annotating and 2) sentiment
information of a pair of words is not considered while annotating.
Inter-annotator correlation scores show that the agreement is better when the
two annotators consider sentiment information while assigning a similarity
score to a pair of words. We use this hypothesis to measure the similarity
between a pair of words. Specifically, we represent each word as a vector
containing sentiment scores of all the content words in the WordNet gloss of
the sense of that word. These sentiment scores are derived from a sentiment
lexicon. We then measure the cosine similarity between the two vectors. We
perform both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation of SenSim and compare the
performance with other widely usedWordNet similarity metrics.

sources of gravitational wave emission for Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo,
expected to be operational in 2015. Finding electromagnetic counterparts to
these signals will be essential to placing them in an astronomical context. The
Swift satellite carries a sensitive X-ray telescope (XRT), and can respond to
target-of-opportunity requests within 1-2 hours, and so is uniquely poised to
find the X-ray counterparts to LIGO/Virgo triggers. Assuming NS mergers are the
progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), some percentage of LIGO/Virgo
triggers will be accompanied by X-ray band afterglows that are brighter than
10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 in the XRT band one day after the trigger time. We find that
a soft X-ray transient of this flux is bright enough to be extremely rare, and
so could be confidently associated with even a moderately localized GW signal.
We examine two possible search strategies with the Swift XRT to find bright
transients in LIGO/Virgo error boxes. In the first strategy, XRT could search a
volume of space with a ~100 Mpc radius by observing ~30 galaxies over the
course of a day, with sufficient depth to observe the expected X-ray afterglow.
For an extended LIGO/Virgo horizon distance, the XRT could employ 100 s
exposures to cover an area of ~ 35 square degrees in about a day, remain
sensitive enough to image GW discovered GRB afterglows. These strategies
demonstrate that discovery of X-ray band counterparts to GW triggers will be
possible.

planar two-dimensional configurations. Some significant differences between
these configurations were noted on the flowfield structure in the reentry
trajectory. The analysis showed that the flow disturbances have different
influence on velocity, density, pressure and temperature along the stagnation

class $\mathcal{B}^1$. Examples of diffusions within class $\mathcal{B}^1$, and
hence those to which the results described within apply, are: Brownian motion
with linear drfit, the 3D Bessel process, the 3D Bessel bridge, and the
Brownian bridge.

of large pieces of software. A scalable alternative is to monitor for contract
violations post-deployment: once a violation is detected, the trace
characterising the offending execution is analysed to pinpoint the source of
the offence. A major drawback with this technique is that, often, contract
violations take time to surface, resulting in long traces that are hard to
analyse. This paper proposes a methodology together with an accompanying tool
for simplifying traces and assisting contract-violation debugging.

like data with a limited but extensible amount of metadata. This approach could
help computer scientists because all information needed to uses subsequently
the data is included in the CSVM file and is particularly well suited for
handling RAW data in a lot of scientific fields and to be used as a canonical
format. The use of CSVM has shown that it greatly facilitates: the data
management independently of using databases; the data exchange; the integration
of RAW data in dataflows or calculation pipes; the search for best practices in
RAW data management. The efficiency of this format is closely related to its
plasticity: a generic frame is given for all kind of data and the CSVM parsers
don't make any interpretation of data types. This task is done by the
application layer, so it is possible to use same format and same parser codes
for a lot of purposes. In this document some implementation of CSVM format for
ten years and in different laboratories are presented. Some programming
examples are also shown: a Python toolkit for using the format, manipulating
and querying is available. A first specification of this format (CSVM-1) is now
defined, as well as some derivatives such as CSVM dictionaries used for data
interchange. CSVM is an Open Format and could be used as a support for Open
Data and long term conservation of RAW or unpublished data.

action with target `spacetime' of four time and four space dimensions
((4+4)-dimensions)). We motivate the subject with three observations. The first
one is that a 4-rebit contains exactly the same number of degree of freedom as
a complex 3-qubit and therefore 4-rebits are special in the sense of division
algebras. Secondly, the (4+4)-dimensions can be splitted as (4+4)=(3+1)+(1+3)
and therefore they are connected with an ordinary (1+3)-spacetime and with
changed signature (3+1)-spacetime. Finally, we show how geometric aspects of
4-rebits can be related to the chirotope concept of oriented matroid theory.
