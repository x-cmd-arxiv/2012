nonlinear systems with input delays that are long and dependent on either time
or the plant state---provided the dependence is known. In this paper we
consider the delay variations as unknown and study robustness of nominal
constant-delay predictor feedbacks under delay variations that depend on time
and the state. We show that when the delay perturbation and its rate have
sufficiently small magnitude, the local asymptotic stability of the closed-loop
system, under the nominal predictor-based design, is preserved. For the special
case of linear systems, and under only time-varying delay perturbations, we
prove robustness of global exponential stability of the predictor feedback when
the delay perturbation and its rate are small in any one of four different
metrics. We present two examples, one that is concerned with the control of a
DC motor through a network and one of a bilateral teleoperation between two
robotic systems.

PMN and demonstrate the presence of an anisotropic damping mechanism directly
related to short-range, polar correlations. For a large range of temperatures
above Tc ~ 210, K, where dynamic polar correlations exist, acoustic phonons
propagating along [1\bar{1}0] and polarized along [110] (TA2 phonons) are
overdamped and softened across most of the Brillouin zone. By contrast,
acoustic phonons propagating along [100] and polarized along [001] (TA1
phonons) are overdamped and softened for only a limited range of wavevectors.
The anisotropy and temperature dependence of the acoustic phonon energy
linewidth are directly correlated with the elastic diffuse scattering,
indicating that polar nanoregions are the cause of the anomalous behavior. The
damping and softening vanish for q -> 0, i.e. for long-wavelength acoustic
phonons, which supports the notion that the anomalous damping is a result of
the coupling between the relaxational component of the diffuse scattering and
the harmonic TA phonons. Therefore, these effects are not due to large changes
in the elastic constants with temperature because the elastic constants
correspond to the long-wavelength limit. We compare the elastic constants we
measure to those from Brillouin scattering and to values reported for pure PT.
We show that while the values of C44 are quite similar, those for C11 and C12
are significantly less in PMN and result in a softening of (C11-C12) over PT.
There is also an increased elastic anisotropy (2C44/(C11-C12)) versus that in
PT. These results suggest an instability to TA2 acoustic fluctuations in
relaxors. We discuss our results in the context of the debate over the
""waterfall"" effect and show that they are inconsistent with TA-TO phonon
coupling or other models that invoke the presence of a second optic mode.

research, but many objects of interest in biology are transparent. Chemical or
immunological dyes, which can often be toxic, fluorescent transgenes, which
require a protocol for transformation of exogenous DNA, and phase contrast,
which inextricably combines phase information with amplitude, all serve to
increase the contrast of transparent objects. Transparent objects of
non-uniform refractive index and/or thickness are phase objects and phase can
be extracted from defocus information above and below the object. The light
microscopist will recognize this in that object contrast can vary as the stage
is moved around an object's focal plane. This phase information can be
quantitatively retrieved from a set of defocused images, but this has the
disadvantage of decreasing temporal resolution, as the microscope stage has to
be moved between image captures. By incorporating additional optics in the form
of an array of pinholes or microlenses, the direction and position of all the
rays can be recorded in a light field, a 4D function. By recording the light
field, multiple planes of focus can be investigated, allowing for the capture
of defocus information in real time. Here I discuss and investigate the use of
the defocus information in a light field to obtain the transport of intensity
equation, and use the fast Fourier transform method to solve this equation for

Ferrofluids suspended in liquids
and constrained in quasi-two dimensional domains were exposed to transverse
magnetic fields. The points of elliptical instability of nearly circular drops
were measured and compared to the theoretical prediction using a fitting
parameter. The data matched the predicted trend well for 3 different liquids
used as suspensions; however, at extreme values of drop radius, there was a
significant deviation from prediction. The angles at each node of the
labyrinthine pattern, formed using high magnetic fields, were measured and
compared with the prediction of 120 degrees. For the dense labyrinth the most
common angles were between 135 degrees -144 degrees, suggesting interaction
between arms were having a repelling effect causing angles to widen. For the
less dense labyrinth the most frequent angle category decreased, supporting
this hypothesis. In the experiments the area, which theoretically should be
constant, was noticed to change and this encouraged an investigation into how
the area varied with an increasing field. A decrease in area is seen initially,
as expected, due to the ferrofluid experiencing a force upwards due to the
field. This was deduced to be an effect of modelling the 3 dimensional system
as quasi-two dimensional. An unpredicted effect, causing the area to increase
after elliptical instability had been reached, was noted in several results and
was hypothesised to be due to a bulging around the sides of the ferrofluid when
the field was large.

correspondence to the Hanbury Brown and Twiss intensity interferometry, are
re-examined. The main subject of the paper is an analysis of the correlation
femtoscopy when the source size is as small as the order of the uncertainty
limit. It is about 1 fm for the current high energy experiments. Then the
standard femtoscopy model of random sources is inapplicable. The uncertainty
principle leads to the partial indistinguishability and coherence of closely
located emitters that affect the observed femtoscopy scales. In thermal systems
the role of corresponding coherent length is taken by the thermal de Broglie
wavelength that also defines the size of a single emitter. The formalism of
partially coherent phases in the amplitudes of closely located individual
emitters is used for the quantitative analysis. The general approach is
illustrated analytically for the case of the Gaussian approximation for
emitting sources. A reduction of the interferometry radii and a suppression of
the Bose-Einstein correlation functions for small sources due to the
uncertainty principle are found. There is a positive correlation between the
source size and the intercept of the correlation function. The peculiarities of
the non-femtoscopic correlations caused by minijets and fluctuations of the
initial states of the systems formed in $pp$ and $e^+e^-$ collisions are also
analyzed. The factorization property for the contributions of femtoscopic and
non-femtoscopic correlations into complete correlation function is observed in
numerical calculations in a wide range of the model parameters.

encoded in the transversal spatial modes of a spontaneous parametric
down-converted signal photon, with the aid of a double slit, with the idler
photon playing a crucial role in creating a heralded single photon source. A

between this measure and standard information theory. The relationship between
the measure and word length is studied for the popular random typing process

containing letters and a space behaving as a word delimiter. Although this
random process does not optimize word lengths according to information content,
it exhibits a linear relationship between information content and word length.
The exact slope and intercept are presented for three major variants of the
random typing process. A strong correlation between information content and
word length can simply arise from the units making a word (e.g., letters) and
not necessarily from the interplay between a word and its context as proposed
by Piantadosi et al. In itself, the linear relation does not entail the results

low-mass stars and brown dwarfs are altered due to chromospheric activity.
Accurate estimates of stellar radii are especially important in the context of
searches for transiting exoplanets, which rely upon the assumed stellar
radius/density to infer the planet radius/density. Our relations are based on a
large set of well studied low-mass stars in the field and on a set of benchmark
low-mass eclipsing binaries. The relations link the amount by which an active
object's temperature is suppressed, and its radius inflated, to the strength of
its Halpha emission. These relations are found to approximately preserve
bolometric luminosity. We apply these relations to the peculiar brown-dwarf
eclipsing binary 2M0535-05, in which the active, higher-mass brown dwarf has a
cooler temperature than its inactive, lower-mass companion. The relations
correctly reproduce the observed temperatures and radii of 2M0535-05 after
accounting for the Halpha emission; 2M0535-05 would be in precise agreement
with theoretical isochrones were it inactive. The relations that we present are
applicable to brown dwarfs and low-mass stars with masses below 0.8 Msun and
for which the activity, as measured by Halpha, is in the range -4.6 < log
Lha/Lbol < -3.3. We expect these relations to be most useful for correcting
radius and mass estimates of low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over their active
lifetimes (few Gyr). We also discuss the implications of this work for

energy consumption, by utilizing two-way communication channels between

the delay tolerance of energy demands in order to balance the energy load over
time, and hence, reduce the total operational cost. This opportunity, however,
comes with security threats, as the grid becomes more vulnerable to
cyber-attacks. In this paper, we study the impact of such malicious
cyber-attacks on the energy efficiency of the grid in a simplified setup. More
precisely, we consider a simple model where the energy demands of the smart
grid consumers are intercepted and altered by an active attacker before they
arrive at the operator, who is equipped with limited intrusion detection
capabilities. We formulate the resulting optimization problems faced by the
operator and the attacker and propose several scheduling and attack strategies
for both parties. Interestingly, our results show that, as opposed to
facilitating cost reduction in the smart grid, increasing the delay tolerance
of the energy demands potentially allows the attacker to force increased costs
on the system. This highlights the need for carefully constructed and robust
intrusion detection mechanisms at the operator.

telluric lines for wavelength calibration, we are able to achieve measurement
precisions of down to 45 m/s for our late-M dwarfs over a one to four year-long
baseline. Our sample contains two stars with RV variations of >1000 m/s. While
we require more measurements to determine whether these RV variations are due
to unseen planetary or stellar companions or are the result of starspots known
to plague the surface of M dwarfs, we can place upper limits of <40 MJsini on
the masses of any companions around those two M dwarfs with RV variations of
<160 m/s at orbital periods of 10-100 days. We have also measured the
rotational velocities for all the stars in our late-M dwarf sample and offer
our multi-order, high-resolution spectra over 2.0 to 2.4 micron to the
atmospheric modeling community to better understand the atmospheres of late-M
dwarfs.

extract the photo-recombination cross-sections from experimental high-order

high-harmonic conversion efficiencies per harmonic near the cutoff are ~10^{-9}

  Vol.4, No.4, 2012",,,"cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Extracting the relevant information by exploiting the spatial data warehouse
becomes increasingly hard. In fact, because of the enormous amount of data
stored in the spatial data warehouse, the user, usually, don't know what part
of the cube contain the relevant information and what the forthcoming query
should be. As a solution, we propose to study the similarity between the
behaviors of the users, in term of the spatial MDX queries launched on the
system, as a basis to recommend the next relevant MDX query to the current
user. This paper introduces a new similarity measure for comparing spatial MDX
queries. The proposed similarity measure could directly support the development
of spatial personalization approaches. The proposed similarity measure takes
into account the basic components of the similarity assessment models: the
topology, the direction and the distance.

distilling the maximally entangled NOON state from arbitrary less-entangled
NOON state with only an auxiliary single photon. With the help of the weak
cross-Kerr nonlinearities, both the two ECPs can be used repeatedly to get a
high success probability. In the first ECP, the auxiliary single photon should
be shared by the two parties say Alice and Bob. In the second ECP, the
auxiliary single photon is only possessed by Bob, which can greatly increase
the practical success probability by avoiding the transmission loss. Moreover,
Bob can operate the whole protocol alone, which makes the protocol more simple.
Therefore, our two ECPs, especially the second ECP may be more useful and
convenient in the current quantum information processing.

interact with other systems. Abnormal transactions, the result of either an
on-going cyber attack or the actions of a benign user, can potentially harm the
interacting systems and therefore they are regarded as a threat. In this paper
we address the problem of anomaly detection and localization in XML
transactions using machine learning techniques. We present a new XML anomaly
detection framework, XML-AD. Within this framework, an automatic method for
extracting features from XML transactions was developed as well as a practical
method for transforming XML features into vectors of fixed dimensionality. With
these two methods in place, the XML-AD framework makes it possible to utilize
general learning algorithms for anomaly detection. Central to the functioning
of the framework is a novel multi-univariate anomaly detection algorithm,
ADIFA. The framework was evaluated on four XML transactions datasets, captured
from real information systems, in which it achieved over 89% true positive
detection rate with less than a 0.2% false positive rate.

this moduli space as an orbifold of a certain flat complex torus. Our results
agree with those obtained previously by instead considering the moduli space as
a complex projective space. An advantage of the present method is that it
allows for a more straightforward determination of the discrete electric 't
Hooft fluxes of the ground states in theories with non-simply connected gauge
groups. A consistency check is provided by the invariance of the results under
the mapping class group of a (Euclidean) three-torus.

  Matrices","8 pages",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cost-sensitive learning relies on the availability of a known and fixed cost
matrix. However, in some scenarios, the cost matrix is uncertain during
training, and re-train a classifier after the cost matrix is specified would
not be an option. For binary classification, this issue can be successfully
addressed by methods maximizing the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) metric.
Since the AUC can measure performance of base classifiers independent of cost
during training, and a larger AUC is more likely to lead to a smaller total
cost in testing using the threshold moving method. As an extension of AUC to
multi-class problems, MAUC has attracted lots of attentions and been widely
used. Although MAUC also measures performance of base classifiers independent
of cost, it is unclear whether a larger MAUC of classifiers is more likely to
lead to a smaller total cost. In fact, it is also unclear what kinds of
post-processing methods should be used in multi-class problems to convert base
classifiers into discrete classifiers such that the total cost is as small as
possible. In the paper, we empirically explore the relationship between MAUC
and the total cost of classifiers by applying two categories of post-processing
methods. Our results suggest that a larger MAUC is also beneficial.
Interestingly, simple calibration methods that convert the output matrix into
posterior probabilities perform better than existing sophisticated post
re-optimization methods.

challenges in next-generation wireless networks such as providing flexible,
adaptive, and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective
solutions to service providers. As WMNs become an increasingly popular
replacement technology for last-mile connectivity to the home networking,
community and neighborhood networking, it is imperative to design efficient and
secure communication protocols for these networks. However, several
vulnerabilities exist in currently existing protocols for WMNs. These security
loopholes can be exploited by potential attackers to launch attack on WMNs. The
absence of a central point of administration makes securing WMNs even more
challenging. The broadcast nature of transmission and the dependency on the
intermediate nodes for multi-hop communications lead to several security
vulnerabilities in WMNs. The attacks can be external as well as internal in
nature. External attacks are launched by intruders who are not authorized users
of the network. For example, an intruding node may eavesdrop on the packets and
replay those packets at a later point of time to gain access to the network
resources. On the other hand, the internal attacks are launched by the nodes
that are part of the WMN. On example of such attack is an intermediate node
dropping packets which it was supposed to forward. This chapter presents a
comprehensive discussion on the current authentication and privacy protection
schemes for WMN. In addition, it proposes a novel security protocol for node
authentication and message confidentiality and an anonymization scheme for
privacy protection of users in WMNs.
