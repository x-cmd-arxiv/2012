fermion-dimer scattering amplitude in fermionic mixtures of two fermion
species. When masses are equal the physical situation is known to be quite
simple. We show that, when the mass ratio is increased, the situation becomes
much more complex. For the s-wave contribution we obtain an analytical solution
in the asymptotic limit of very large mass ratio. In this regime the s-wave
scattering amplitude displays a large number of zeros, essentially linked to
the known large value of the fermion-dimer scattering length in this regime. We
find by an exact numerical calculation that a zero is still present for a mass
ratio of 15. For the p-wave contribution we make our study below the mass ratio
of 8.17, where a fermion-dimer bound state appears. We find that a strong
p-wave resonance is present at low energy, due to a virtual bound state, in the
fermion-dimer system, which is a forerunner of the real bound state. This
resonance becomes prominent in the mass ratio range around the one
corresponding to the $^{40}$K - $^6$Li mixtures, much studied experimentally.
This resonance should affect a number of physical properties. These include the
equation of state of unbalanced mixtures at very low temperature but also the
equation of state of balanced mixtures at moderate or high temperature. The
frequency and the damping of collective modes should also provide a convenient
way to evidence this resonance. Finally it should be possible to modify the
effective mass of one of the fermionic species by making use of an optical
lattice. This would allow to study the strong dependence of the resonance as a
function of the mass ratio of the two fermionic elements. In particular one
could check if the virtual bound state is relevant for the instabilities of
these mixtures.

approach, based on the same assumption, was instead recently supplied by some
of us and called {\it extended semantic realism} ({\it ESR}) model. We show
here that one can extract from the ESR model several local finite models
referring to the specific physical situation considered in the GHZ experiment,
and that these models can be converted into the toy models for the GHZ
experiment worked out by Szab\'o and Fine.

appear dark in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is due to the extremely
short-lived proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals. This short
lifetime is due to strong dipolar interactions between immobilized proton
spins, which render it challenging to detect these signals with sufficient
resolution and sensitivity. Here we show the possibility of exciting long-lived
signals in cortical bone tissue with a signature consistent with that of bound
water signals. Contrary to long-standing belief, it is further shown that
dipolar coupling networks are an integral requirement for the excitation of
these long-lived signals. The use of these signals could enhance the ability to
visualize rigid tissues and solid samples with high sensitivity, resolution,
and specificity via MRI.

energy resolution at a future high energy collider, such as the International
Linear Collider (ILC). However, the use of particle flow calorimetry at the
proposed multi-TeV Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) poses a number of significant
new challenges. At higher jet energies, detector occupancies increase, and it
becomes increasingly difficult to resolve energy deposits from individual
particles. The experimental conditions at CLIC are also significantly more
challenging than those at previous electron-positron colliders, with increased
levels of beam-induced backgrounds combined with a bunch spacing of only 0.5
ns. This paper describes the modifications made to the PandoraPFA particle flow
algorithm to improve the jet energy reconstruction for jet energies above 250
GeV. It then introduces a combination of timing and p_T cuts that can be
applied to reconstructed particles in order to significantly reduce the
background. A systematic study is performed to understand the dependence of the
jet energy resolution on the jet energy and angle, and the physics performance
is assessed via a study of the energy and mass resolution of W and Z particles
in the presence of background at CLIC. Finally, the missing transverse momentum
resolution is presented, and the fake missing momentum is quantified. The
results presented in this paper demonstrate that high granularity particle flow
calorimetry leads to a robust and high resolution reconstruction of jet
energies and di-jet masses at CLIC.

obtained with self-consistent multifluid hydromagnetic models of C-type shocks
propagating through dusty media. The threshold shock speed for mantle
sputtering is about 10 km/s and is independent of density. The mantles are
completely vapourised in shocks with speeds of 20-25 km/s. At such shock speeds
core sputtering commences and gas-phase SiO forms. Core destruction is not
total in any C-type shock because grains are not completely destroyed in shocks
with speeds near the minimum speeds at which J-type shocks appear. Due to the
density-dependence of the critical shock speed for this transition, higher
gas-phase SiO fractional abundances are produced behind shocks propagating in
lower density gas. For shock speeds near the threshold speeds for both core and
mantle sputtering, sputtering is much greater for shock velocities at smaller
angles relative to the upstream magnetic field. At higher shock speeds, the
angular variation is still present but less pronounced.

number of linearly dispersing gapless electronic surface states. It is well
known that such a surface cannot be described by an effective two-dimensional
lattice model (without breaking the time-reversal symmetry), which often
hampers theoretical efforts to quantitatively understand some of the properties
of such surfaces, including the effect of strong disorder, interactions and
various symmetry-breaking instabilities. Here we formulate a lattice model that
can be used to describe a {\em pair} of STI surfaces and has an odd number of

Hamiltonian consists of two planar tight-binding models with spin-orbit
coupling, representing the two surfaces, weakly coupled by terms that remove
the extra Dirac points from the low-energy spectrum. We illustrate the utility
of this model by studying the magnetic and exciton instabilities of the STI
surface state driven by short-range repulsive interactions and show that this
leads to results that are consistent with calculations based on the continuum
model as well as three-dimensional lattice models. We expect the model
introduced in this work to be widely applicable to studies of surface phenomena

The plasma and radiation exchange momentum via resonant scattering and

decreasing Lorentz factor. There is an extended zone around the magnetar where
the plasma flow is ultra-relativistic; its Lorentz factor is self-regulated so

opaque in an outer equatorial zone, where the decelerated plasma accumulates
and annihilates; this region serves as a reflector for the thermal photons
emitted by the neutron star. The e+- flow carries electric current, which is
sustained by a moderate induced electric field. The electric field maintains a
separation between the electron and positron velocities, against the will of
the radiation field. The two-stream instability is then inevitable, and the
induced turbulence can generate low-frequency emission. In particular, radio
emission may escape around the magnetic dipole axis of the star. Most of the
flow energy is converted to hard X-ray emission, which is examined in the
accompanying paper.

formed during gas-rich major mergers are long-lived and could be responsible
for old stellar streams and likely induce the formation of tidal dwarf galaxies
(TDGs). Using several hydrodynamical simulations we have investigated the most
prominent tidal tail formed during the first passage, which is gas-rich and
contains old and metal poor stars. We discovered several striking coincidences
after comparing its location and motion to those of the Milky Way (MW) and of
the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). First, the tidal tail is sweeping a relatively
small volume in which the MW precisely lies. Because the geometry of the merger
is somehow fixed by the anisotropic properties of the Giant Stream (GS), we
evaluate the chance of the MW to be at such a rendez-vous with this gigantic
tidal tail to be 5 %. Second, the velocity of the tidal tail matches the LMC
proper motion, and reproduce quite well the geometrical and angular momentum
properties of the MW dwarfs, i.e. the so-called disk of satellites, better
called Vast Polar Structure (VPOS). Third, the simulation of the tidal tail
reveals one of the formed TDG with mass and location almost comparable to those
of the LMC. Our present modeling is however too limited to study the detailed
interaction of gas-rich TDGs with the potential of the MW, and a complementary
study is required to test whether the dwarf intrinsic properties can be
accounted for by our scenario. Nevertheless this study suggests a causal link
between an ancient, gas-rich major merger at the M31 location, and several
enigma in the Local Group, the GS, the VPOS, and the presence of the MCs.

cluster near its upper mass limit is a focal topic of investigation as it
determines the high mass stellar content and hence the dynamics of the cluster
at its embedded phase as well as during its young gas-free phase. The massive
stellar content of a young cluster, however, can be substantially modified due
to the dynamical ejections of the massive stars so that the present-day
high-mass stellar mass function (hereafter MF) can be different than that with
which the cluster is born. Aims: In the present study, we provide a preliminary
estimate of this evolution of the high-mass IMF of a young cluster due to early
ejections of massive stars, using the Large Magellanic Cloud massive, young
cluster R136 as an example. Methods: To that end, we utilize the results of the
state-of-the-art calculations by Banerjee, Kroupa & Oh (2012) comprising direct
N-body computations of realistic, binary-rich, mass-segregated models of R136.
In particular, these calculations provide the ejection fraction of stars as a
function of stellar mass. Results: We find that if the measured IMF of R136 is
granted to be canonical, as observations indicate, then the ""true"" high-mass
IMF of R136 at its birth must be at least moderately top-heavy when corrected
for the dynamical escape of massive stars. Conclusions: The top-heaviness of
the true high-mass IMF over the observationally determined one is a general
feature of massive, young clusters where the dynamical ejection of massive
stars is efficient. We discuss its implications and possible improvements over
our current estimate.

data with new, multi-object Magellan spectroscopy to investigate the detailed
galaxy distribution near each absorber. All of these three absorption systems
are within the projected virial radii of nearby galaxies and/or groups, and
could therefore arise in these virialized structures rather than (or in
addition to) the WHIM. However, we find no additional galaxies near a fourth
""void"" absorber recently found in the spectrum, suggesting that this system may
indeed trace gas unassociated with any individual halo. Though the number of
known systems is still small, spatial coincidences suggest that some X-ray
absorbers lie in galaxy and/or group environments, though others could still

context of a two Higgs doublets model with a heavy 4th sequential generation of
fermions, in which one Higgs doublet couples only to the 4th generation
fermions, while the second doublet couples to the lighter fermions of the
1st-3rd families. This model is designed to accommodate the apparent heaviness
of the 4th generation fermions and to effectively address the low-energy
phenomenology of a dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking scenario. The
physical Higgs states of the model are, therefore, viewed as composites
primarily of the 4th generation fermions. We find that the lightest Higgs, h,
is a good candidate for the recently discovered 125 GeV spin-zero particle,
when tan\beta ~ O(1), for typical 4th generation fermion masses of M_{4G} = 400
-600 GeV, and with a large t - t' mixing in the right-handed quarks sector.
This, in turn, leads to BR(t' -> t h) ~ O(1), which drastically changes the t'
decay pattern. We also find that, based on the current Higgs data, this two
Higgs doublet model generically predicts an enhanced production rate (compared
to the SM) in the pp -> h -> tau tau channel and a reduced VV -> h -> gamma
gamma and pp -> V -> Vh -> Vbb ones. Finally, the heavier CP-even Higgs is
excluded by the current data up to m_H ~ 500 GeV, while the pseudoscalar state,
A, can be as light as 130 GeV. These heavier Higgs states and the expected
deviations from the SM in some of the Higgs production channels can be further
excluded or discovered with more data.

measurements, gas mass fractions, f_gas, appear to be considerably larger than
the cosmic mean at the virial radius, R_200, questioning the accuracy of the
cosmological parameter estimations. Here, we use a large suite of cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations to study measurement biases of f_gas. We employ
different variants of simulated physics, including radiative gas physics, star
formation, and thermal feedback by active galactic nuclei. Computing the mass
profiles in 48 angular cones, whose footprints partition the sphere, we find
anisotropic gas and total mass distributions that imply an angular variance of
f_gas at the level of 30%. This anisotropic distribution originates from the
recent formation epoch of clusters and from the strong internal
baryon-to-dark-matter density bias. In the most extreme cones, f_gas can be
biased high by a factor of two at R_200 in massive clusters, thereby providing
a potential explanation for high f_gas measurements by Suzaku. While projection
lowers this factor, there are other measurement biases that may (partially)
compensate. We find that at R_200, f_gas is biased high by 20% when assuming
hydrostatic equilibrium masses, i.e., neglecting the kinetic pressure, and by
another ~10-20% due to the presence of density clumping. At larger radii, both
measurement biases increase dramatically. While the cluster sample variance of
the true f_gas decreases to a level of 5% at R_200, the sample variance that
includes both measurement biases remains fairly constant at the level of
10-20%. The constant redshift evolution of f_gas within R_500 for massive
clusters is encouraging for using gas masses to derive cosmological parameters.

been detected. For the first time, we examine whether this effect is detected
in N-body simulations by calculating and comparing pitch angles of both
individual density waves and overall spiral structure in a suite of N-body
simulations. We find that higher galactic shear rates produce more tightly
wound spiral arms, both in individual mode patterns (density waves) and in the
overall density enhancement. Although the mode pattern pitch angles by
construction remain constant with time, the overall logarithmic spiral arm
winds over time, which could help to explain the scatter in the relation
between pitch angle versus shear seen from observations. The correlation
between spiral arm pitch angle and galactic shear rate that we find in N-body
simulations may also explain why late Hubble type of spiral galaxies tend to
have more open arms.

hole binaries on generic, eccentric orbits in numerical relativity. The linear
momentum considered ranges from that of a circular orbit to ten times that
value. We discuss the different manifestations of zoom-whirl behavior in the
hyperbolic and the elliptic regime. The hyperbolic data set applies to
dynamical capture scenarios (e.g. in globular clusters). Evolutions in the
elliptic regime correspond to possible end states of supermassive black hole
binaries. We spot zoom-whirl behavior for eccentricities as low as $e\sim0.5$,
i.e. within the expected range of eccentricities in massive black hole binaries
from galaxy mergers and binaries near galactic centers. The resulting
gravitational waveforms reveal a rich structure, which will effectively break
degeneracies in parameter space improving parameter estimation.

galaxy formation about the role played by major mergers in the late buildup of
massive E-S0's. We re-address this question by analysing the morphology,
structural distortion level, and star formation enhancement of a sample of
massive galaxies (M_* > 5 * 10^10 Msun) lying on the Red Sequence and its
surroundings at 0.3 < z < 1.5. We have used an initial sample of ~1800 sources
with K_s < 20.5 mag over an area ~155 arcmin^2 on the Groth Strip, combining
data from the Rainbow Extragalactic Database and the GOYA Survey. Red galaxy
classes that can be directly associated to intermediate stages of major mergers
and to their final products have been defined. We report observational evidence
of the existence of a dominant evolutionary path among massive red galaxies at
0.6<z<1.5, consisting in the conversion of irregular disks into irregular
spheroids, and of these ones into regular spheroids. This result implies that:
1) the massive red regular galaxies at low redshifts derive from the irregular
ones populating the Red Sequence and its neighbourhood at earlier epochs up to
z~1.5; 2) the progenitors of the bulk of present-day massive red regular
galaxies have been blue disks that have migrated to the Red Sequence mostly
through major mergers at 0.6 < z < 1.2 (these mergers thus starting at z~1.5);
and 3) the formation of E-S0's that end up with M_*> 10^11 Msun at z=0 through
gas-rich major mergers has frozen since z~0.6. All these facts support that
major mergers have played the dominant role in the definitive buildup of
present-day E-S0's with M_*> 10^11 Msun at 0.6<z<1.2, in good agreement with
hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation.

evidence suggests the merger of a binary compact object system as the source

between a binary neutron star progenitor and a black hole-neutron star

observational signature of SGRBs originating in mixed binary systems, and
quantify both the fraction of mixed binaries capable of producing SGRBs, and
the distributions of precession amplitudes and periods. The difficulty inherent
in disrupting a neutron star outside the horizon of a stellar-mass black hole
biases the jet precession signal towards low amplitude and high frequency.
Precession periods of ~ 0.01-0.1 s and disk-BH spin misalignments ~10 degrees
are generally expected, although sufficiently high viscosity may prevent the
accumulation of multiple precession periods during the SGRB. The precessing jet
will naturally cover a larger solid angle in the sky than would standard SGRB
jets, enhancing observability for both prompt emission and optical afterglows.

Earth have characteristic albedos and occupy a different color space in the
visible waveband (0.4-0.9 microns) that can be distinguished remotely. These
detectable surface features can be linked to the extreme niches that support
extremophiles on Earth and provide a link between geomicrobiology and

percolation processes that arise in voter models, the Domany-Kinzel (DK) model,
contact process, etc. We explore the differences between linear (flat front)
expansions and the much less familiar radial (curved front) range expansions.
For the radial expansion, we develop a generalized, off-lattice DK model that
minimizes otherwise persistent lattice artifacts. With both simulations and
analytical techniques, we study the survival probability of advantageous
mutants, the spatial correlations between domains of neutral strains, and the
dynamics of populations with deleterious mutations. ""Inflation"" at the frontier
leads to striking differences between radial and linear expansions. For a
colony with initial radius $R_0$ expanding at velocity $v$, significant genetic
demixing, caused by local genetic drift, only occurs up to a finite time $t^* =
R_0/v$, after which portions of the colony become causally disconnected due to
the inflating perimeter of the expanding front. As a result, the effect of a
selective advantage is amplified relative to genetic drift, increasing the
survival probability of advantageous mutants. Inflation also modifies the
underlying directed percolation transition, introducing novel scaling functions
and modifications similar to a finite size effect. Finally, we consider radial
range expansions with deflating perimeters, as might arise from colonization
initiated along the shores of an island.

are monomial with respect to coordinates in a fixed birational model X
dominating Y, we show that for any regular function f on Y at 0, the function
v--> v(f)/\ord_0(f) is uniformly Lipschitz continuous as a function of the
weight defining v. As a consequence, the volume of v is also a Lipschitz
continuous function. Our proof uses toroidal techniques as well as positivity
properties of the images of suitable nef divisors under birational morphisms.

emerges if the effective theory describing color charge fluctuations at a scale
on the order of the saturation momentum is approximately Gaussian. From an
evolution equation for quantum corrections which includes both saturation as
well as fluctuations we find that evolution with the QCD \beta-function

saturation effects and running-coupling evolution are both required in order to
reproduce geometric scaling of the DIS cross section and KNO scaling of virtual

contains ~5x10^8 M_sun of HI. We detect no diffuse stellar light at the

the tail might have formed as gas was stripped from the outer regions of NGC
3187 (a member of HCG 44) by the group tidal field. In this case, a simple
model indicates that about 1/3 of the galaxy's HI was stripped during a time
interval of <1 Gyr. Alternatively, the tail may be the remnant of an
interaction between HCG 44 and NGC 3162, a spiral galaxy now ~650 kpc away from
the group. Regardless of the precise formation mechanism, the detected HI tail
shows for the first time direct evidence of gas stripping in HCG 44. It also
highlights that deep HI observations over a large field are needed to gather a
complete census of this kind of events in the local Universe.

systems we have been happily traversing on now for almost three decades.
Achieving quasi-one dimensional electron gas (Q-1DEG) [or quantum wire(s) for
more practical purposes] led us to some mixed moments in this journey: while
the reduced phase space for the scattering led us believe in the route to the
faster electron devices, the proximity to the 1D systems left us in the dilemma
of describing it as a Fermi liquid or as a Luttinger liquid. No one had ever
suspected the potential of the former, but it took quite a while for some to
convince the others on the latter. A realistic Q-1DEG system at the low
temperatures is best describable as a Fermi liquid rather than as a Luttinger
liquid. In the language of condensed matter physics, a critical scrutiny of
Q-1DEG systems has provided us with a host of exotic (electronic, optical, and
transport) phenomena revealing their unparallel behavior characteristics unseen
in their higher or lower dimensional counterparts. Here, we embark on the
systematic investigation of the inelastic electron scattering (IES) and of
inelastic light scattering (ILS) from the elementary electronic excitations in
quantum wires in the absence of an applied magnetic field. To that end, we
begin with the Kubo's correlation functions to derive the generalized nonlocal,
dynamic dielectric function, the inverse dielectric function, and the Dyson

Bragg scattering from an off-resonant laser is used to split an atomic wave
function into two separated packets. After one or more oscillations in the
trap, the wave packets are recombined by a second application of the Bragg
laser to close the interferometer. Anharmonicity in the trap potential can lead
to a phase shift in the interferometer output. In this paper, analytical
expressions for the anharmonic phase are derived at leading order for

generally depends on the initial position and velocity of the atom, which are

showing that under a reasonable set of conditions, the combined parameter

Whenever $m \le \sqrt{N}$, this guarantee matches the best possible rate

of bootstrap subsampling. Requiring only a single round of communication, it

pairs, correlations are measured between the orbital angular momentum (OAM) in
a target beam (which contains an unknown object) and that in an empty reference
beam. Unlike previous studies, the effects of the object on off-diagonal
elements of the OAM correlation matrix are examined. Due to the presence of the
object, terms appear in which the signal and idler OAM do not add up to that of
the pump. Using these off-diagonal correlations, the potential for
high-efficiency object identification by means of correlated OAM states is
experimentally demonstrated for the first time. The higher-dimensional OAM
Hilbert space enhances the information capacity of this approach, while the
presence of the off-diagonal correlations allows for recognition of specific
spatial signatures present in the object. In particular, this allows the
detection of discrete rotational symmetries and the efficient evaluation of
multiple azimuthal Fourier coefficients using fewer resources than in
conventional pixel-by-pixel imaging. This represents a demonstration of sparse
sensing using OAM states, as well as being the first correlated OAM experiment
to measure properties of a real, stand-alone object, a necessary first step
toward correlated OAM-based remote sensing.

exponentially with pressure and exhibit a departure from exponential behavior
at pressures between 250-400 atm for all the temperatures studied in our

increases upon further increase of pressure. The sharp change in division time
is followed by a sharp change in phenotypic transition of E. Coli at high

model that this phenotypic changes in bacteria at high pressures is an
irreversible stochastic process whereas the switching probability to elongating

haploid model with selection and homologous recombination. We define utility in
terms of two metrics - the increase in frequency of fit genotypes, and the
increase in average population fitness, relative to those associated with
selection only. Explicitly, we exhaustively explore the eight-dimensional
parameter space of a two-locus two-allele system, showing, as a function of the
landscape and the initial population, that recombination is beneficial in terms
of our metrics in two distinct regimes: a landscape independent regime - the
""search"" regime - where recombination aids in the search for a fit genotype
that is absent or at low frequency in the population; and the ""modular"" regime,
associated with quasi-additive fitness landscapes with low epistasis, where
recombination allows for the juxtaposition of fit ""modules"" or Building Blocks.
Thus, we conclude that the ubiquity and utility of recombination is intimately

hydrodynamics and the transfer of the H and He ionising photons are
consistently coupled. Moreover we take into account H_2 non-equilibrium
chemistry, including photo-dissociation. The most striking feature of the
simulations is a high spatial resolution for the radiative transfer (RT)
calculation which enables us to start considering not only external UV feedback
processes but also internal UV feedback processes in each galaxy. We find that
the star formation is significantly suppressed due to the internal UV and
supernova (SN) feedback. In low mass galaxies with M<10^9Msun, a large amount
of gas is evacuated by photo-evaporation as previous studies have shown, which
results in the suppression of star formation. Surprisingly, star formation in
massive halos is also strongly suppressed despite the fact that these halos
hardly lose any gas by photo-evaporation. The suppression of star formation in
massive halos is mainly caused by following two factors; (i) small scale clumpy
structures in the galaxies are smoothened by the internal feedback, (ii)
although the dense gas in the galaxies is mostly neutral, the H_2 formation and
cooling processes are disturbed by mild photo-heating. Photo-dissociating
radiations actually suppress star formation, but the magnitude of the effect is
not so large in massive galaxies. Even though our simulation volume is too
small to be a representative patch of the Universe during reionisation, we find
that our simulated star formation rate densities and HI fractions at z=6-7 are
consistent with those found in observations.

coupling two particles. To get $C^2$-convergence (in particular, convergence of

developed here only for the case of constant curvature metrics on surfaces,

defining non-Euclidean analogues of the Euclidean Funk weak metric and we give

extension of the Standard Model (SM) with a singlet fermion dark matter (DM).
In this model, the singlet scalar plays the role of a messenger between the SM
sector and the dark matter sector. This model has two Higgs-like scalar bosons,
and is consistent with all the data on electroweak precision tests, thermal
relic density of DM and its direct detection constraints. We show that this
model is stable without hitting Landau pole up to Planck scale for 125 GeV
Higgs boson. We also perform a comprehensive study of vacuum structure, and
point out that a region where electroweak vacuum is the global minimum is
highly limited. In this model, both Higgs-like scalar bosons have reduced
couplings to the SM weak gauge bosons and the SM fermions, because of the
mixing between the SM Higgs boson and the singlet scalar. There is also a
possibility of their invisible decay(s) into a pair of DM's. Therefore this
model would be disfavored if the future data on the $(\sigma \cdot B)_{VV}$ or

biological sensors as well as model systems to understand transport phenomena

been so far focused on understanding the effect of the pore opening diameter on
ionic transport. In this article we present systematic studies on the
dependence of ion transport properties on the pore length. Particular attention
was given to the effect of ion current rectification exhibited for conically
shaped nanopores with homogeneous surface charges. We found that reducing the
length of conically shaped nanopores significantly lowered their ability to
rectify ion current. However, rectification properties of short pores can be
enhanced by tailoring the surface charge and the shape of the narrow opening.
Furthermore we analyze the relationship of the rectification behavior and ion
selectivity for different pore lengths. All simulations were performed using
MsSimPore, a software package for solving the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP)
equations. It is based on a novel finite element solver and allows for
simulations up to surface charge densities of -2 e/nm^2. MsSimPore is based on
1D reduction of the PNP model, but allows for a direct treatment of the pore

the emission from the star-forming rings or giant HII regions in the spiral
arms. The Br_g and [FeII] line at 1.644 micron trace the same structures,

the [FeII] seems to be more extended and diffuse. The ULIRG subsample contains

with secondary nuclei or tidal tails. The gas kinematics in LIRGs are primarily
due to rotational motions around the centre of the galaxy, although local
deviations associated with radial flows and/or regions of higher velocity

kinematics to first order, showing slight differences in the velocity
amplitudes in some cases, whereas the average velocity dispersions are

the mean velocity of the moving particles by almost two orders of magnitude,
precisely because ratchet motion has both a diffusive and a deterministic

to standard techniques of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference or sum-frequency
generation. We measure the quantum state of the broadband bi-photons, amplitude
and phase, with a pairwise ""Mach-Zehnder"" quantum interferometer, where
bi-photons that are generated in one nonlinear crystal are enhanced
(constructive interference) or diminished (destructive interference) in another
crystal, depending on the bi-photon phase. We verify the quantum nature of the
interference by observing the dependence of the fringe visibility on internal
loss. Since destructive interference is equivalent to an attempt to annihilate
in the second crystal (by up-conversion) the bi-photons that were created in
the first crystal (by down-conversion), the fringe visibility is a measure for
the quantum bi-photon purity of the broadband light. The measurement speed-up
is due to the large homodyne-like gain from the strong pump
($\!\sim\!10^{7-9}$) in the up-conversion efficiency of single bi-photons,
which enables the use of simple photo-detection of the full, ultra-high photon
flux instead of single-photon / coincidence counting.

stoichiometrically halogenated graphene derivatives (fluorographene and other
analogous graphene halides) show (i) localized orbital basis sets can be
successfully and effectively used for such 2D materials; (ii) several
functionals predict that the band gap of graphane is greater than that of
fluorographene, whereas HSE06 gives the opposite trend; (iii) HSE06 functional
predicts quite good values of band gaps w.r.t benchmark theoretical and
experimental data; (iv) the zero band gap of graphene is opened by
hydrogenation and halogenation and strongly depends on the chemical composition
of mixed graphene halides; (v) the stability of graphene halides decreases
sharply with increasing size of the halogen atom - fluorographene is stable,
whereas graphene iodide spontaneously decomposes. In terms of band gap and
stability, the C2FBr, and C2HBr derivatives seem to be promising materials,
e.g., for (opto)electronics applications, because their band gaps are similar
to those of conventional semiconductors, and they are expected to be stable
under ambient conditions. The results indicate that other fluorinated compounds
(CaHbFc and CaFbYc, Y = Cl, Br, I) are stable insulators.

problem of [M. Horodecki $et. al$, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 047902(2003)] showing a
limitation of their method for detecting nondistinguishability. (2). We show
that a maximally entangled state and its orthogonal complement, no matter how
many copies are supplied, can not be distinguished by PPT POVMs, even
unambiguously. This result is much stronger than the previous known ones
\cite{DUAN06,BAN11}. (3). We study the entanglement cost of distinguishing
quantum states. It is proved that $\sqrt{2/3}\ket{00}+\sqrt{1/3}\ket{11}$ is
sufficient and necessary for distinguishing three Bell states by PPT POVMs. An
upper bound of entanglement cost of distinguishing a $d\otimes d$ pure state
and its orthogonal complement is obtained for separable operations. Based on
this bound, we are able to construct two orthogonal quantum states which cannot
be distinguished unambiguously by separable POVMs, but finite copies would make
them perfectly distinguishable by LOCC. We further observe that a two-qubit
maximally entangled state is always enough for distinguishing a $d\otimes d$
pure state and its orthogonal complement by PPT POVMs, no matter the value of
$d$. In sharp contrast, an entangled state with Schmidt number at least $d$ is
always needed for distinguishing such two states by separable POVMs. As an
application, we show that the entanglement cost of distinguishing a $d\otimes
d$ maximally entangled state and its orthogonal complement must be a maximally
entangled state for $d=2$,which implies that teleportation is optimal; and in
general, it could be chosen as $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log d}{d})$.

the edges into bundles. We propose a method of edge bundling drawing each edge
of a bundle separately as in metro-maps and call our method ordered bundles. To
produce aesthetically looking edge routes it minimizes a cost function on the
edges. The cost function depends on the ink, required to draw the edges, the
edge lengths, widths and separations. The cost also penalizes for too many
edges passing through narrow channels by using the constrained Delaunay
triangulation. The method avoids unnecessary edge-node and edge-edge crossings.
To draw edges with the minimal number of crossings and separately within the
same bundle we develop an efficient algorithm solving a variant of the
metro-line crossing minimization problem. In general, the method creates clear
and smooth edge routes giving an overview of the global graph structure, while
still drawing each edge separately and thus enabling local analysis.

constant gap where only the user with the strongest link to the destination
needs to engage in cooperation, (b) for both FD and HD: backward joint decoding
is not necessary to achieve capacity to within a constant gap, and (c) for HD:
time sharing between the case where the two users do not cooperate and the case

to be used at the sensors and the fusion rule based on all previous quantized
observations. Information regarding updated quantizers is sent back to the
sensors for use at the next time. In this paper, the conditional joint pdf is
represented in a parametric form by using the copula framework. The unknown

let $f$ be a smooth map from $M$ into $N$. We consider a covariant symmetric
tensor $T_f$ $=$ ${\displaystyle f^*h - \frac{1}{m} |df|^2 g}$, where $f^*h$
denotes the pull-back metric of $h$ by $f$. The tensor $T_f$ vanishes if and
only if the map $f$ is weakly conformal. The norm $|T_f|$ is a quantity which
is a measure of conformality of $f$ at each point. We are concerned with maps
which are critical points of the functional $\Phi (f)$ $=$ ${\displaystyle
\int_M |T_f|^2dv_g}$. We call such maps {\it C-stationary maps}. Any conformal
map or more generally any weakly conformal map is a C-stationary map. It is of
interest to find when a C-stationary map is a (weakly) conformal map.
  In this paper we prove the following result. If $f$ is a stable C-stationary
maps from the standard sphere ${\mathrm S}^m$ $(m \geq 5)$ or into the standard
sphere ${\mathrm S}^n$ $(n \geq 5)$, then $f$ is a weakly conformal map.

novel lineages and adaptation to new environments. Increased allelic variation
and modification of the transcriptional network are the two recognized forces
currently deemed to be responsible for the phenotypic properties seen in
hybrids. However, since the majority of the biological functions in a cell are
carried out by protein complexes, inter-specific protein assemblies therefore
represent another important source of natural variation upon which evolutionary
forces can act. Here we studied the composition of six protein complexes in two
different Saccharomyces ""sensu strictu"" hybrids, to understand whether chimeric
interactions can be freely formed in the cell in spite of species-specific
co-evolutionary forces, and whether the different types of complexes cause a
change in hybrid fitness. The protein assemblies were isolated from the hybrids
via affinity chromatography and identified via mass spectrometry. We found
evidence of spontaneous chimericity for four of the six protein assemblies
tested and we showed that different types of complexes can cause a variety of
phenotypes in selected environments. In the case of TRP2/TRP3 complex, the
effect of such chimeric formation resulted in the fitness advantage of the
hybrid in an environment lacking tryptophan, while only one type of parental
combination of the MBF complex could confer viability to the hybrid under
respiratory conditions. This study provides empirical evidence that chimeric
protein complexes can freely assemble in cells and reveals a new mechanism to
generate phenotypic novelty and plasticity in hybrids to complement the genomic
innovation resulting from gene duplication. The ability to exchange orthologous
members has also important implications for the adaptation and subsequent
genome evolution of the hybrids in terms of pattern of gene loss.

can directly communicate with the coordinator-process but cannot communicate
the other remote site processes. Every remote-site process generates and
maintains micro- clusters that represent cluster information summary, from its

coordinator by the serialization technique, or the coordinator invokes the
remote methods in order to get the local micro-clusterings from the remote

mechanism to generate a two dimensional electron gas, namely, the breaking of
charge ordering at the surface of a charge ordered semiconductor due to the
incomplete oxygen environment of the surface ions. The emergence of the 2D gas
is independent of the presence of oxygen vacancies or polar discontinuities;
this is a self-doping effect. This mechanism might apply to many charge ordered
systems, in particular, we study the case of BaBiO3(001). In bulk, this
material is a prototype of a ""forbidden valence"" compound in which the formal
""metallic"" Bi4+ state is skipped exhibiting a charge disproportionated Bi3+ -
Bi5+ ordered structure. At room temperature, this charge disproportionation
together with the breathing distortions gives rise to a Peierls semiconductor
with monoclinic crystal structure. At higher temperature (T > 750 K) or upon
doping, it turns cubic and metallic. Interestingly, doped BaBiO3 was one of the
first non-cuprate high-Tc superconductors discovered. The outer layer of the
Bi-terminated simulated surface turns more cubic- like and metallic while the
inner layers remain in the insulating monoclinic state. On the other hand, the
metallization does not occur for the Ba termination, a fact that makes this
system appealing for nanostructuring. Finally, this finding sets another
possible route for future exploration: the potential scenario of 2D
superconductivity at the BaBiO3 surface.

shows that the upper critical field gradually increases to its maximum value

effect of spacetime backreaction on the critical temperature and the upper

flow in a layer of fluid of constant depth. Continuously forced as well as
decaying flows are investigated. Optical altimetry is used to measure the
gradient of the surface elevation field and to obtain the velocity and
vorticity fields with high temporal and spatial resolution. Spectral analysis
of the flows demonstrates the formation of dual cascade with energy and
enstrophy intervals although the corresponding spectral fluxes of energy and
enstrophy are not uniform in these intervals. The energy interval is
characterized by the slope of approximately -5/3 in terms of wavenumber and is
limited in extent by the finite radius of deformation effect. In the enstrophy
range, the slope is steeper than -3 due to the presence of long-lived coherent
vortices. The spatial patterns of spectral fluxes in the flow indicate that
inverse energy transfer and direct enstrophy transfer occur mainly in elongated
vorticity patches. Cyclone/anticyclone asymmetry in favor of anticyclones is
observed in our flows. Dominance of anticyclones is most clear during the decay
phase of turbulence. The anticyclones remain circular while cyclonic vorticity
is stretched into elongated patches. Measurements show that skewness of
vorticity distribution increases with increasing Froude number of the flow.
Inertial and Kelvin waves are detected in our experiments; their
characteristics are analysed against the appropriate dispersion relations.

surveillance problem to improve its scalability (i.e., linear time) in the

one and turns at still later times into subdiffusion; eventually normal
diffusion is achieved. Our theory agrees very well with the MD results,
although extreme computational costs prevented to detect the final diffusion

band integrated and surface photometry have been obtained in far-UV and near-UV
with GALEX, and in u,g, r, i, z (SDSS) bands. H_alpha imaging and 2D high
resolution kinematical data have been obtained using PUMA Scanning Fabry-Perot

and kinematical distortions that may be connected to either on-going and/or
past interaction/accretion events or environmental induced secular evolution.
U268 appears more active than U376, with a large fraction of galaxies showing
interaction signatures (60% vs. 13%). The presence of bars among late-type
galaxies is ~10% in U268 and ~$29% in U376. The cumulative distribution of (FUV

regard the problem of finding conservative parameterization schemes as a
conservation law classification problem for classes of differential equations.
The relevant classification problems can be solved using the direct or inverse
classification procedures. In the direct approach, one starts with a general
functional form of the parameterization scheme. Specific forms are then found
so that corresponding closed equations admit conservation laws. In the inverse
approach, one seeks parameterization schemes that preserve one or more
pre-selected conservation laws of the initial model. The physical
interpretation of both classification approaches is discussed. Special
attention is paid to the problem of finding parameterization schemes that
preserve both conservation laws and symmetries. All methods are illustrated by
finding conservative and conservative invariant parameterization schemes for
systems of one-dimensional shallow-water equations.

are given in the form of probability distributions described by multivariable
Hermite polynomials with time-dependent arguments. The obtained results are
generalized in the present work and are applied to determining the transition

using a novel approach. When the set $S_n$ is meet closed, we give a sufficient
and necessary condition for the positive definiteness of the matrix $(S_n)_f$.
From this condition we obtain some sufficient conditions for positive
definiteness as corollaries. We also use graph theory and show that by making
some graph theoretic assumptions on the set $S_n$ we are able to reduce the
assumptions on the function $f$ while still preserving the positive
definiteness of the matrix $(S_n)_f$. Dual theorems of these results for join
matrices are also presented. As examples we consider the so-called power GCD
and power LCM matrices as well as MIN and MAX matrices. Finally we give bounds
for the eigenvalues of meet and join matrices in cases when the function $f$

plasma (a system of N point electrons with mutual Coulomb interactions) in a
uniform stationary magnetic field. We take N up to 512, with periodic boundary
conditions, and macroscopic parameters corresponding to the weak coupling
regime, with a coupling parameter \Gamma=1/64. We find that a transition from
order to chaos takes place when the density is increased or the field decreased
so that the ratio \omega_p/\omega_c between plasma and cyclotron frequencies
becomes of order 1 (or equivalently the ratio r_L/\lambda_D between Larmor
radius and Debye length becomes of order 1). The result is in agreement with
the theoretical prediction obtained in [1], on the basis of an old estimate of
Iglesias, Lebowitz and MacGowan [2] for the intensity of the electric field
acting on one electron and due to all the other ones. A comparison can be made
with the threshold obtained from kinetic theory arguments, which corresponds to
the condition \nu_{ee}/\omega_c=1, where \nu_{ee} is the electron collision
frequency. The latter threshold has a completely different dependence on the
physical parameters and, for \Gamma=1/64, gives a critical value of \omega_p
about 80 times larger.

axisymmetry to understand the post-shock-revival evolution of core-collapse
supernovae. Assuming that the stalled shock wave is relaunched by neutrino
heating and employing the so-called light bulb approximation, we induce shock
revival by raising the neutrino luminosity by hand up to the critical value,
which is also de- termined by dynamical simulations. A 15M_{sun} progenitor
model is employed. We incorporate nuclear network calculations with a
consistent equation of state in the simulations to account for the energy
release by nuclear reactions and their feedback to hydrodynamics. Varying the
shock-relaunch time rather arbitrarily, we investigate the ensuing long-term
evolutions systematically, paying particular attention to the explosion energy
and nucleosynthetic yields as a function of this relaunch time, or equivalently
the accretion rate at shock revival. We study in detail how the diagnostic
explosion energy approaches the asymptotic value and which physical processes
contribute to the explosion energy in what proportions as well as their
dependence on the relaunch time and the dimension of dynamics. We find that the
contribution of nuclear reactions to the explosion energy is comparable to or
greater than that of neutrino heating. In particular, recombinations are
dominant over burnings in the contributions of nuclear reactions. Interestingly
1D models studied in this paper cannot produce the appropriate explosion energy
and nickel mass simultaneously, overproducing nickels, whereas this problem is
resolved in 2D models if the shock is relaunched at 300-400ms after bounce.

in two catalogs from their positions and positional uncertainties. The
probability that an object is associated with a source from the other catalog,
or that it has no counterpart, is derived under two exclusive assumptions:
first, the classical case of several-to-one associations, and then the more
realistic but more difficult problem of one-to-one associations.
  In either case, the likelihood of observing the objects in the two catalogs
at their effective positions is computed and a maximum likelihood estimator of
the fraction of sources with a counterpart -- a quantity needed to compute the
probabilities of association -- is built. When the positional uncertainty in
one or both catalogs is unknown, this method may be used to estimate its
typical value and even to study its dependence on the size of objects. It may
also be applied when the true centers of a source and of its counterpart at
another wavelength do not coincide.
  To compute the likelihood and association probabilities under the different
assumptions, we developed a Fortran 95 code called ""Aspects"" ([asp{\epsilon}],
""ASsociation PositionnellE/ProbabilistE de CaTalogues de Sources"" in French);
its source files are made freely available. To test Aspects, all-sky mock
catalogs containing up to 10^5 objects were created, forcing either
several-to-one or one-to-one associations. The analysis of these simulations
confirms that, in both cases, the assumption with the highest likelihood is the
right one and that estimators of unknown parameters built for the appropriate
association model are reliable.
