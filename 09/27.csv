exhibit permanent oscillations. Other distributions exhibit Landau damping and
relax towards a steady state. We illustrate this behaviour with the Cauchy

consistent with our simulations and the other ones in the literature. We
propose an analogy between the regime without (with) a gap in the disk and the
Type I (Type II) migration that is observed in simulations of planet-disk

  In particular, we show that:

  (2) NNL for this categorical quotient can be solved deterministically in time
quasi-polynomial in the dimension of $V$.
  (3) The categorical quotient of the space of $r$-tuples of $m \times m$

  (5) NNL for every explicit variety in zero or large enough characteristic can
be solved deterministically in quasi-polynomial time, assuming the hardness

the valence charge densities of the doped and un-doped systems, we find that
sulfur partially donates its px- and py- electrons to the system with some back
donation to the S pz-states. To obtain accurate description of the excited
electronic states, we calculate the electronic structure of the systems using
the GW method. The band gap width calculated for g-C3N4 is found to be equal to
2.7 eV that is in agreement with experiment. We find the S doping to cause a
significant narrowing the gap. Furthermore, the electronic states just above
the gap become occupied upon doping that makes the material a conductor.
Analysis of the projected local densities of states provides insight into the
mechanism underlying such dramatic changes in the electronic structure of
g-C3N4 upon the S doping. Based on our results, we propose a possible

DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well-known in social psychology as
biased assimilation: when presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a
complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position
thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of
homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in either
polarization, persistent disagreement or consensus depending on how biased
individuals are. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation,
is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation
also provides insight into the following related question: do internet based
recommender algorithms that show us personalized content contribute to
polarization? We make a connection between biased assimilation and the
polarizing effects of some random-walk based recommender algorithms that are

produces results which are not straightforward to interpret. To overcome this
problem, probability models are often used to produce more compact and
conclusive results, albeit with some loss of accuracy. Bayesian statistics have
been widely used in the development of probability models in machine learning
in recent years and these methods have many advantages, including their
abilities to avoid overfitting. In this paper, we develop two Bayesian mixture
models with the Dirichlet distribution prior and the Dirichlet process (DP)
prior to improve the previous non-Bayesian mixture model developed for
transaction dataset mining. We implement the inference of both mixture models
using two methods: a collapsed Gibbs sampling scheme and a variational
approximation algorithm. Experiments in several benchmark problems have shown
that both mixture models achieve better performance than a non-Bayesian mixture
model. The variational algorithm is the faster of the two approaches while the
Gibbs sampling method achieves a more accurate results. The Dirichlet process
mixture model can automatically grow to a proper complexity for a better
approximation. Once the model is built, it can be very fast to query and run
analysis on (typically 10 times faster than Eclat, as we will show in the
experiment section). However, these approaches also show that mixture models
underestimate the probabilities of frequent itemsets. Consequently, these
models have a higher sensitivity but a lower specificity.

or whose contribution is significant for connections? Centrality metrics play
an important role while answering these questions. The betweenness metric is
useful for network analysis and implemented in various tools. Since it is one
of the most computationally expensive kernels in graph mining, several
techniques have been proposed for fast computation of betweenness centrality.
In this work, we propose and investigate techniques which compress a network
and shatter it into pieces so that the rest of the computation can be handled
independently for each piece. Although we designed and tuned the shattering
process for betweenness, it can be adapted for other centrality metrics in a
straightforward manner. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques

AdS scenario where none of the important physical quantities is infinite. Among
these quantities are the components of the energy momentum tensor, which have

result a thick brane configuration, in a six dimensional context. Moreover, the
study of the scalar field localization in these scenario is done.

sequence stars. The origin of such dust is not clear, given that it has a short
lifetime against both collisions and radiative forces. Even a collisional
cascade with km-sized parent bodies, as suggested to explain outer debris
discs, cannot survive sufficiently long. In this work we investigate whether
the observed exozodiacal dust could originate from an outer planetesimal belt.
We investigate the scattering processes in stable planetary systems in order to
determine whether sufficient material could be scattered inwards in order to
retain the exozodiacal dust at its currently observed levels. We use N-body
simulations to investigate the efficiency of this scattering and its dependence
on the architecture of the planetary system. The results of these simulations
can be used to assess the ability of hypothetical chains of planets to produce
exozodi in observed systems. We find that for older (>100Myr) stars with
exozodiacal dust, a massive, large radii (>20AU) outer belt and a chain of
tightly packed, low-mass planets would be required in order to retain the dust
at its currently observed levels. This brings into question how many, if any,
real systems possess such a contrived architecture and are therefore capable of
scattering at sufficiently high rates to retain exozodi dust on long

numerical approximations may converge without any arbitrarily small polynomial

use an equation of motion directly derived from Fermats principle. The rendered
images generally exhibit significant imperfections. This includes the obvious
fact that cloaking does not work at all for horizontal or for ordinary linear
polarization of light. Moreover, more subtle effects occur such as
viewing-angle-dependent aberrations. However, we still find amazingly good
cloaking performance for the purely dielectric azimuthal uniaxial cloak.

redefinitions, and is unitary. This unitarity implies a de Sitter version of
the optical theorem. We explicitly verify these properties to second order in
the coupling for a general cubic interaction, including both tree- and
loop-level contributions. Contrary to other statements in the literature, we
find that a particle of any positive mass may decay at tree level to any number

to estimate F in each individual and within each chromosome. Variation in F
across chromosomes within individuals was too large to be consistent with
sampling effects alone. Furthermore, estimates of F for each chromosome in
different populations were not correlated. Our results show how detailed
comparisons of population genomic data can be made to theoretical predictions.
The application of methods to the Complete Genomics data set shows that the
extent of apparent inbreeding varies across chromosomes and across individuals,
and estimates of inbreeding coefficients are subject to unexpected levels of
variation which might be partly accounted for by selection.

metric, their partition functions are volume forms on the moduli space of genus
g Riemann surfaces M_g, or on its super analog. It is well known that modular
invariance fixes strong constraints that in some cases appear only at higher
genus. Here we classify all the Weyl and modular invariant partition functions
given by the path integral on the world-sheet metric, together with space-time
coordinates, b-c and/or beta-gamma systems, that correspond to volume forms on
M_g. This was a long standing question, advocated by Belavin and Knizhnik,
inspired by the Serre GAGA principle and based on the properties of the Mumford
forms. The key observation is that the Bergman reproducing kernel provides a
Weyl and modular invariant way to remove the point dependence that appears in
the above string determinants, a property that should have its superanalog
based on the super Bergman reproducing kernel. This is strictly related to the
properties of the propagator associated to the space-time coordinates. Such
partition functions Z[J] have well-defined asymptotic behavior and can be
considered as a basis to represent a wide class of string theories. In
particular, since non-critical bosonic string partition functions Z_D are
volume forms on M_g, we suggest that there is a mapping, based on bosonization
and degeneration techniques, from the Liouville sector to first order systems
that may identify Z_D as a subclass of the Z[J]. The appearance of b-c and
beta-gamma systems of any conformal weight shows that such theories are related
to W algebras. The fact that in a large N 't Hooft-like limit 2D W_N minimal
models CFTs are related to higher spin gravitational theories on AdS_3,
suggests that the string partition functions introduced here may lead to a
formulation of higher spin theories in a string context.

for X-ray bursts using the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) aboard the Fermi
Gamma-ray Space Telescope we have detected 15 thermonuclear bursts from the NS
low-mass X-ray binary 4U 0614+09, when it was accreting at nearly 1% of the
Eddington limit. We measured an average burst recurrence time of 12+/-3 d (68%
confidence interval) between March 2010 and March 2011, classified all bursts
as normal duration bursts and placed a lower limit on the recurrence time of
long/intermediate bursts of 62 d (95% confidence level). We discuss how
observations of thermonuclear bursts in the hard X-ray band compare to pointed
soft X-ray observations, and quantify such bandpass effects on measurements of
burst radiated energy and duration. We put our results for 4U 0614+09 in the
context of other bursters and briefly discuss the constraints on ignition
models. Interestingly, we find that the burst energies in 4U 0614+09 are on
average between those of normal duration bursts and those measured in
long/intermediate bursts. Such a continuous distribution in burst energy
provides a new observational link between normal and long/intermediate bursts.
We suggest that the apparent bimodal distribution that defined normal and
long/intermediate duration bursts during the last decade could be due to an
observational bias towards detecting only the longest and most energetic bursts
from slowly accreting NSs.

using the larger 9 deg^2 NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Bootes field which also
has considerably deeper WISE observations than the COSMOS field, and find that
this simple color-cut significantly loses reliability at fainter fluxes. We
define a modified selection criterion combining the W1-W2 color and the W2
magnitude to provide highly reliable or highly complete AGN samples for fainter
WISE sources. In particular, we define a color-magnitude cut that finds 130+/-4
deg^-2 AGN candidates for W2<17.11 with 90% reliability. Using the extensive UV

spectral energy distributions of WISE AGN candidates. As expected, the WISE AGN
selection is biased towards objects where the AGN dominates the bolometric
luminosity output, and that it can identify highly obscured AGN. We study the
distribution of reddening in the AGN sample and discuss a formalism to account
for sample incompleteness based on the step-wise maximum-likelihood method of
Efstathiou et al.(1988). The resulting dust obscuration distributions depend
strongly on AGN luminosity, consistent with the trend expected for a Simpson

Type 1, while at ~4x10^45 erg/s the fraction is 64+/-13%. The distribution of

dwarf galaxies. The low dust abundance enhances the penetration of UV photons
into the interstellar medium (ISM), resulting in a relatively larger filling
factor of the ionized gas. Furthermore, there is likely a hidden molecular gas
reservoir probed by the [CII]157um line. We present Herschel/PACS maps in
several tracers, [CII], [OI]63um,145um, [NII]122um, [NIII]57um, and [OIII]88um
in the HII region N11B in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Halpha and [OIII]5007A
images were used as complementary data to investigate the effect of dust
extinction. Observations were interpreted with photoionization models to infer
the gas conditions and estimate the ionized gas contribution to the [CII]
emission. Photodissociation regions (PDRs) are probed through polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We first study the distribution and properties of
the ionized gas. We then constrain the origin of [CII]157um by comparing to
tracers of the low-excitation ionized gas and of PDRs. [OIII] is dominated by
extended emission from the high-excitation diffuse ionized gas; it is the
brightest far-infrared line, ~4 times brighter than [CII]. The extent of the
[OIII] emission suggests that the medium is rather fragmented, allowing far-UV
photons to permeate into the ISM to scales of >30pc. Furthermore, by comparing
[CII] with [NII], we find that 95% of [CII] arises in PDRs, except toward the
stellar cluster for which as much as 15% could arise in the ionized gas. We
find a remarkable correlation between [CII]+[OI] and PAH emission, with [CII]
dominating the cooling in diffuse PDRs and [OI] dominating in the densest PDRs.
The combination of [CII] and [OI] provides a proxy for the total gas cooling in
PDRs. Our results suggest that PAH emission describes better the PDR gas
heating as compared to the total infrared emission.

for the near BMN string and successfully match these against Bethe ansatz

which we compare with the poles of loop corrected propagators, at both the one

find that the bosonic and fermionic contributions sum up to zero. Under the

may reinterpret these as real solutions in an analytically-continued theory.
Since the supersymmetry transformation rules now require the gravitino to be
complex, the analytically-continued theory has a ""fake supersymmetry"" rather
than a genuine supersymmetry. Nevertheless, the concept of
pseudo-supersymmetric solutions is a useful one, since the Killing spinor
equations provide first-order equations for the bosonic fields.

spacetime, is a relatively simple physical model that allows us to study many
aspects in explicit detail. In this review we focus on the theory of thermal
equilibrium (KMS) states of such a field in a stationary spacetime. Our
presentation draws on several existing sources and aims to give a unified
exposition. We also take the opportunity to weaken some of the technical
assumptions of the earlier literature. In particular, we completely drop any
assumptions on the behaviour of the norm and lapse of the Killing field. This
is especially important for physical applications to the exterior region of a
stationary black hole.
  Our review includes results on the existence of a unique ground state and of
unique quasi-free KMS states, as well as an evaluation of the evidence that
motivates the use of the KMS-condition to characterise thermal equilibrium. We
especially draw attention to the poorly understood behaviour of the notion of
temperature of a quantum field with respect to locality.
  If the spacetime is standard static (i.e. if it admits a Cauchy surface that
is orthogonal to the Killing field) the analysis can be done even more
explicitly. For compact Cauchy surfaces we consider Gibbs states and their
properties. For general Cauchy surfaces we give a detailed and rigorous
justification of the technique of Wick rotation, including the explicit
determination of the Killing-time dependence of the quasi-free KMS states.

ionized.
  We find that our spatial treatment of the ionization field leads to
drastically different numbers and spatial distributions when compared to models
where globular cluster formation is simply truncated at a given redshift. We
find that it is possible for metal-poor globular clusters to have formed via
the dark matter halo formation channel as our secondary model (delayed
formation) combined with truncation at z = 10 produces radial distributions
statistically consistent with that of the Milky Way metal-poor globular
clusters.
  If globular clusters do indeed form within high-redshift dark matter halos,
if only in-part, their contributions to the reionization of the local (i.e. 2^3
h^-3 Mpc^3 centred on the host galaxy) volume and mass by redshift 10 could be
as high as 98% and 90%, respectively. In our photon poorest model, this
contribution drops to 60% and 50%. The surviving clusters in all models have a
narrow average age range (mean = 13.34 Gyr, \sigma = 0.04 Gyr) consistent with
current ages estimates of the Milky Way metal-poor globular clusters.

acceleration up to TeV energies and VHE gamma-ray emission and absorption with
changing geometrical configurations on a periodic basis. These sources produce
outflows of radio-emitting particles whose structure can be imaged with VLBI.
LS 5039 is a gamma-ray binary that has shown variable VLBI structures in the
past. We aim to characterise the radio morphological changes of LS 5039 and
discriminate if they are either repeatable or erratic. We observed LS 5039 with
the VLBA at 5 GHz during five consecutive days to cover the 3.9-day orbit and
an extra day to disentangle between orbital or secular variability. We also
compiled the available high-resolution radio observations of the source to
study its morphological variability at different orbital phases. We used a
simple model to interpret the obtained images. The new observations show that
the morphology of LS 5039 up to projected distances of 10 milliarcseconds
changes in 24 h. The observed radio morphological changes display a periodic
orbital modulation. Multifrequency and multiepoch VLBI observations confirm
that the morphological periodicity is stable on timescales of years. Using a
simple model we show that the observed behaviour is compatible with the
presence of a young non-accreting pulsar with an outflow behind it. The
morphology is reproduced for inclinations of the orbit of 60-75 deg. For masses
of the companion star in the range 20-50 Msun, this range of inclinations
implies a mass of the compact object of 1.3-2.7 Msun. The periodic orbital
modulation of the radio morphology of LS 5039 suggests that all gamma-ray
binaries are expected to show a similar behaviour. The changes in the radio
structure of LS 5039 are compatible with the presence of a young non-accreting
neutron star, which suggests that the known gamma-ray binaries contain young
pulsars.

stars of intermediate mass efficiently cycle carbon into nitrogen in their
envelopes, the same evolution scenario predicts the existence of a population
of nitrogen-enhanced metal-poor (NEMP) stars, with [N/Fe] > 1 and [N/C] > 0.5.
Such NEMP stars are rare, although their occurrence depends on metallicity:
they appear to be more common at [Fe/H] < -2.8 by about a factor of 10 compared
to less metal-poor stars. We analyse the observed sample of metal-poor stars
with measurements of both carbon and nitrogen to derive firm constraints on the
occurrence of NEMP stars as a function of metallicity. We compare these
constraints to binary population synthesis calculations in which we vary the
initial distributions of mass, mass ratio and binary orbital periods. We show
that the observed paucity of NEMP stars at [Fe/H] > -2.8 does not allow for
large modifications in the initial mass function, as have been suggested in the
literature to account for the high frequency of CEMP stars. The situation at
lower metallicity is less clear, and we do not currently have stellar models to
perform this comparison for [Fe/H] < -2.8. However, unless intermediate-mass
AGB stars behave very differently at such low metallicity, the observed NEMP
frequency at [Fe/H] < -2.8 appears incompatible with the top-heavy forms of the

profile $r(\rho)=\sqrt{\rho^{2}+a^{2}}$ for arbitrary coupling of the field to
the curvature. This calculation has previously been considered numerically by
Bezerra and Khusnutdinov, while analytic results have been obtained in the
special cases of minimal ($\xi=0$) coupling and conformal coupling ($\xi=1/8$
in three dimensions). We present here a closed form expression for the static
Green's function for arbitrary coupling and hence we obtain an analytic
expression for the self-force. The self-force depends crucially on the coupling
of the field to the curvature of the space-time and hence it is useful to
determine the dependence explicitly. The numerical computation can identify
some qualitative aspects of this dependence such as the change in the sign of
the force as it passes through the conformally coupled value, as well as the
fact that the self-force diverges for $\xi=1/2$. From the closed form
expression, it is straight-forward to see that there is an infinite set of
values of the coupling constant for which the self-force diverges, but we also
see that there is an infinite set of values for which the self-force vanishes.

foreseen Super-Galactic plane, while both HIRES and AUGER confirmed this
apparent GZK cut-off in the spectra. However, the same AUGER composition since
2007 had favored nuclei (and not nucleons). The recent absence of narrow angle
clustering in UHECR maps, as it should be expected for protons, the missing of
events along the nearest Cluster Virgo, the wide spread (nearly 16 degree
angle) of UHECR along Cen A are in disagreement with the first proton-UHECR
AUGER understanding. Since 2008 we had claimed a light nuclei role for the Cen
A crowded area. However the ICECUBE absence of TeV neutrino clustering or
anisotropy, its spectra steepening favors mostly a ruling atmospheric neutrino
noise up to tens TeV. However two recent PeV neutrino event, cannot easily
coexist or been extrapolated with such an atmospheric ruling scenario, or with
GZK (either nucleons or nuclei) secondary expected spectra. Finally tens of TeV
gamma anisotropy in ARGO-MILAGRO-ICECUBE maps may hardly be associated with
known hadronic sources. We imagine such anisotropy ruled by diffused gamma
secondaries, shining along UHECR bending and flight: radioactive (Ni,Co,Al,D,

decaying in flight, may paint in the sky (by gamma, electrons and neutrinos

review of the traditional TF model without an explicit spin interaction and
find that the spin splittings are too small in this approach. An explicit spin
interaction is then introduced which entails the definition of a generalized
spin ""flavor"". We investigate baryonic states in this approach which can be
described with two inequivalent wave functions; such states can however apply
to multiple degenerate flavors. We find that the model requires a spatial
separation of quark flavors, even if completely degenerate. Although the TF
model is designed to investigate the possibility of many-quark states, we find
surprisingly that it may be used to fit the low energy spectrum of almost all
ground state octet and decuplet baryons. The charge radii of such states are
determined and compared with lattice calculations and other models. The low
energy fit obtained allows us to extrapolate to the six-quark doubly strange
{\it H}-dibaryon state, flavor symmetric strange states of higher quark content
and possible six quark nucleon-nucleon resonances. The emphasis here is on the
{\it systematics} revealed in this approach. We view our model as a versatile

combination of their apparent rate of motion and exposure duration. Nearby
asteroids in particular typically have high apparent rates of motion and
acceleration. Their recovery, especially on their discovery apparition, depends
upon obtaining good astrometry from the trailed detections. We present an
analytic function describing a trailed detection under the assumption of a
Gaussian point spread function (PSF) and constant rate of motion. We have fit
the function to both synthetic and real trailed asteroid detections from the
Pan-STARRS1 survey telescope to obtain accurate astrometry and photometry. For
short trails our trailing function yields the same astrometric and photometry
accuracy as a functionally simpler 2-d Gaussian but the latter underestimates
the length of the trail - a parameter that can be important for measuring the
object's rate of motion and assessing its cometary activity. For trails longer
than about 10 pixels (> 3xPSF) our trail fitting provides 3-times better
astrometric accuracy and up to 2 magnitudes improvement in the photometry. The
trail fitting algorithm can be implemented at the source detection level for
all detections to provide trail length and position angle that can be used to
reduce the false tracklet rate.

interaction of a monopole vortex with an isolated topographic feature is
addressed. Two different cases when the monopole locates either within the
upper or the middle layer are of our interest. In the bottom layer, there is a
delta function topographic feature, which generates a closed recirculation
region in its vicinity due to the background flow. This recirculation region
extends to the middle and upper layers, and it plays the role of a topographic
vortex. The interaction between the monopole and the topographic vortex causes
complex, including chaotic, advection of fluid particles. We show that the
model's parameters, namely, the monopole and topographic vortices' strengths
and initial positions, the layers' depths and densities are responsible for the
diverse advection patterns. While the patterns are rather complicated, however,
one can single out two major processes, which mostly govern fluid particle
advection. The first one is the variation in time of the system's phase space
structure, so that within the closed region of the topographic vortex, there
appear periodically unclosed particle pathways by which the particles leave the
topographic vortex. The second one is chaotic advection that arises from the
nonstationarity of the monopole-topography interaction.

restricted to the hyper elliptic cases are investigated in the NSR formalism,
based on the DHoker Phong and recent results. A set of equations, which we can
regard as a basic tool to sum over the spin structures of any of g loop, M
point amplitudes systematically, is shown by using a classical result of
Abelian functions. We discuss structures of g loop, M point massless external
boson superstring amplitudes by assuming that the spin structure dependence of
any of the disconnected amplitudes is only on one kind of constants, the genus
g Weierstrass Pe function valued at the summation of g number of half periods
chosen out of 2g+1 half periods. This is a natural generalization of the case
of genus 1. This assumption will be validated by a conjectured theorem which
states that the spin structure dependent part of any string amplitude will be
naturally decomposed into two parts. One is composed of manifestly modular
invariant functions of positions of inserting operators, and the other is the
polynomial of Pe function constants related to the moduli of Riemann surfaces
only. It is shown that this is actually the case for any M for g=1, and M=1,2,3
for any g. Due to a technical problem, our consideration is at present
restricted to the case that g(g+1)divided by 2 is odd. Example calculations are
shown for the genus 2 by the method described here. In particular, our method
correctly reproduces biholomorphic 1 form of DHoker Phong result as for the
four point amplitudes of the disconnected parts.

extant near and mid infrared absolute calibrations. While 2MASS magnitudes are

bright, solar-like stars exhibit anomalous WISE colors. In most cases this
effect is spurious and traceable to lower quality measurements, although for a

towards the presence of warm/hot debris disks.

turbulent medium and has been studied mostly for uniform or spatially
homogeneous seed magnetic fields. However, some astrophysical processes (e.g.
jets from active galaxies, galactic winds, or ram-pressure stripping in galaxy
clusters) can provide localized seed magnetic fields. In this paper, we
numerically study amplification of localized seed magnetic fields in a
turbulent medium. Throughout the paper, we assume that driving scale of
turbulence is comparable to the size of the system. Our findings are as
follows. First, turbulence can amplify a localized seed magnetic field very
efficiently. The growth rate of magnetic energy density is as high as that for
a uniform seed magnetic field. This result implies that a magnetic field
ejected from an astrophysical object can be a viable source of magnetic field
in a cluster. Second, the localized seed magnetic field disperses and fills the
whole system very fast. If turbulence in a system (e.g. a galaxy cluster or a
filament) is driven at large scales, we expect that it takes a few large-eddy
turnover times for magnetic field to fill the whole system. Third, growth and
turbulence diffusion of a localized seed magnetic field are also fast in high
magnetic Prandtl number turbulence. Fourth, even in decaying turbulence, a
localized seed magnetic field can ultimately fill the whole system. Although
the dispersal rate of magnetic field is not fast in purely decaying turbulence,
it can be enhanced by an additional forcing.

negative (left-handed) twist due to the counterclockwise motion of the positive
sunspot and is rooted in the regions of both polarities in the sunspot at a
considerable distance from the polarity inversion line (PIL). In the flare
phase, dramatic magnetic reconnection occurs in those negatively twisted lines
in which the absolute value of the twist is greater than a half-turn. The other
type consists of both positively and negatively twisted field lines formed
relatively close to the PIL between two sunspots. A strong CaII image began to
brighten in this region of mixed polarity, in which the positively twisted
field lines were found to be injected within one day across the pre-existing
negatively twisted region, along which strong currents were embedded.
Consequently, the central region near the PIL distributed with a mix of
differently twisted field lines and the strong currents may play a prominent
role in flare onset.

critical one. More importantly, we show for the first time that the critical
mass varies with the initial effective Lorentz factor <\gamma> following a
simple scaling of the type M_c ~ K <\gamma>^{-1.0}, thus indicating that a
black hole of infinitesimal mass is produced in the limit of a diverging
Lorentz factor. Furthermore, because a scaling is present also in terms of the
initial stellar compactness, we provide a condition for black-hole formation in
the spirit of the hoop conjecture.

that are not included in any of the registers. The issue of whether or not
marginalizing the full table of registers by covariates over one or more
covariates leaves the estimated population size estimate invariant is
intimately related to collapsibility of contingency tables [Biometrika 70

size invariance is equivalent to the simultaneous collapsibility of each margin
consisting of one register and the covariates. We give a short path
characterization of the loglinear model which describes when marginalizing over
a covariate leads to different population size estimates. Covariates that are
collapsible are called passive, to distinguish them from covariates that are
not collapsible and are termed active. We make the case that it can be useful
to include passive covariates within the estimation model, because they allow a
finer description of the population in terms of these covariates. As an example

117+/-2 m/s in depths around 1.2 Mm in the centre of the supergranule and
root-mean-square vertical velocity of 21 m/s over the area of the supergranule.
A discrepancy between this measurement and the measured surface vertical
velocity (a few m/s) can be explained by the existence of the large-amplitude
vertical flow under the surface of supergranules with large divergence signals,
recently suggested by Duvall & Hanasoge (2012).

Einstein equations proved quite adjustable to mimic the metric functions of all
numerically constructed neutron-star models that we used as a testbed. The
neutron-star models covered a wide range of stiffness, with regard to the
equation of state of their interior, and all rotation rates up to the maximum
possible rotation rate allowed for each such star. Apart of the metric
functions themselves, we have compared the radius of the innermost stable
circular orbit $R_{\rm{ISCO}}$, the orbital frequency
$\Omega\equiv\frac{d\phi}{dt}$ of circular geodesics, and their epicyclic
frequencies $\Omega_{\rho}, \Omega_z$, as well as the change of the energy of
circular orbits per logarithmic change of orbital frequency $\Delta\tilde{E}$.
All these quantities, calculated by means of the two-soliton analytic metric,
fitted with good accuracy the corresponding numerical ones as in previous
analogous comparisons (although previous attempts were restricted to neutron
star models with either high or low rotation rates). We believe that this
particular analytic solution could be considered as an analytic faithful
representation of the gravitation field of any rotating neutron star with such

using this space-time to interpret observations of astrophysical processes that
take place around it.

detailed measurements of the low temperature magnetic properties of Er2Ti2O7,
which displays a second-order phase transition at T_N \simeq 1.2 K with
coexisting short- and long-range orders. Magnetic-susceptibility studies show
that there is no spin-glass-like irreversible effect. Heat-capacity
measurements reveal that the paramagnetic critical exponent is typical of a
3-dimensional XY magnet while the low-temperature specific heat sets an upper
limit on the possible spin-gap value and provides an estimate for the spin-wave
velocity. Muon spin relaxation measurements show the presence of spin dynamics
in the nanosecond time scale down to 21 mK. This time range is intermediate
between the shorter time characterizing the spin dynamics in Tb2Sn2O7, which
also displays long- and short-range magnetic order, and the time scale typical
of conventional magnets. Hence the ground state is characterized by exotic spin
dynamics. We determine the parameters of a symmetry-dictated Hamiltonian
restricted to the spins in a tetrahedron, by fitting the paramagnetic diffuse
neutron scattering intensity for two reciprocal lattice planes. These data are
recorded in a temperature region where the assumption that the correlations are

Carinae that consists of two components: (1) a strong wind (MdotM=0.33 Msun/yr;
v=200 km/s), blowing for 30 years, followed by (2) a 1e50 erg explosion in
1844. The ensuing collision between the fast ejecta and the CSM causes an
increase in brightness observed at the end of 1844, followed by a sustained
high-luminosity phase lasting for 10-15 years that matches the historical light
curve. The emergent luminosity is powered by CSM interaction, analogous to the
process in luminous Type IIn supernovae, except with 10 times lower explosion
energy and at slower speeds (causing a longer duration and lower emergent
luminosity). Such an explosive event provides a natural explanation for the
light curve evolution, but also accounts for a number of puzzling attributes of
the Homunculus nebula: (1) rough equipartition of total radiated and kinetic
energy, (2) the double-shell structure of the Homunculus, (3) the apparent
single age and Hubble-like flow resulting from the thin swept-up shell, (4) the
complex mottled appearance of the polar lobes in HST images, arising from
Raleigh-Taylor or Vishniac instabilities, (5) efficient and rapid dust
formation, as seen in Type IIn supernovae, and (6) the fast (5000 km/s)
material outside the Homunculus, arising from the acceleration of the forward
shock upon exiting the dense CSM. In principle, the bipolar shape has already
been explained in earlier studies of interacting winds, except that here the
CSM interaction occurs over only 10 years, producing a thin shell with the
resulting structures then frozen-in to the expanding bipolar nebula. This
self-consistent picture has a number of implications for other eruptive
transients, many of which may also be powered by CSM interaction.

push-operations, and they do not need an a priori estimate on the number of
failed nodes.

approaches, algorithms based on random gossip (typically needing a large number
of messages due to their unorganized nature) and algorithms based on fair
workload splitting (which are either not {time-efficient} or require intricate
preprocessing steps plus synchronization).

all starting nodes in the whole graph. The formula is expressed in terms of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of Laplacian matrix for the graph. We then use the
formula to deduce a tight lower bound for the GMFPT in terms of only the
numbers of nodes and edges, as well as the degree of the trap, which can be
achieved in both complete graphs and star graphs. We show that for a large
sparse graph the leading scaling for this lower bound is proportional to the
system size and the reciprocal of the degree for the trap node. Particularly,
we demonstrate that for a scale-free graph of size $N$ with a degree
distribution $P(d)\sim d^{-\gamma}$ characterized by $\gamma$, when the trap is
placed on a most connected node, the dominating scaling of the lower bound
becomes $N^{1-1/\gamma}$, which can be reached in some scale-free graphs.
Finally, we prove that the leading behavior of upper bounds for GMFPT on any
graph is at most $N^{3}$ that can be reached in the bar-bell graphs. This work

bioinformatics. We consider here the situation where two configurations are
matched under various constraints, namely, the configurations have a subset of
manually located ""markers"" with high probability of matching each other while a
larger subset consists of unlabeled points. We consider a plausible model and
give an implementation using the EM algorithm. The work is motivated by a real

of missing and misallocated markers. The methodology is successfully used to
automatically locate and remove a grossly misallocated marker within the given

universality of time-averaged observables under aging conditions. According to
Aaronson-Darling-Kac theorem, in non-aged dynamical systems with infinite
invariant measures, the distribution of the normalized time averages of
integrable functions converge to the Mittag-Leffler distribution. This well
known theorem holds when the start of observations coincides with the start of
the dynamical processes. Introducing a concept of the aging limit where the
aging time $t_a$ and the total measurement time $t$ goes to infinity while the
aging ratio $t_a/t$ is a constant, we obtain a novel distributional limit
theorem of time-averaged observables integrable with respect to the infinite

intermittent maps, we find that regular motions and a weakly chaotic behavior
coexist in the aging limit. This mixed type of dynamics is controlled by the
aging ratio and hence is very different from the usual scenario of regular and
chaotic motions in Hamiltonian systems. The probability of finding regular
motions in non-aged processes is zero, while in the aging regime it is finite
and it increases when system ages.

is paramount to bond portfolio management and derivative security pricing. Yet
a universal model for yield curve forecasting has been elusive, and prior
attempts often resulted in a trade-off between goodness of fit and consistency
with economic theory. To address this, herein we propose a novel formulation
which connects the dynamic factor model (DFM) framework with concepts from
functional data analysis: a DFM with functional factor loading curves. This
results in a model capable of forecasting functional time series. Further, in
the yield curve context we show that the model retains economic interpretation.
Model estimation is achieved through an expectation-maximization algorithm,
where the time series parameters and factor loading curves are simultaneously
estimated in a single step. Efficient computing is implemented and a
data-driven smoothing parameter is nicely incorporated. We show that our model
performs very well on forecasting actual yield data compared with existing
approaches, especially in regard to profit-based assessment for an innovative
trading exercise. We further illustrate the viability of our model to
applications outside of yield forecasting.

field sweep rate dependence of the exchange bias, is experimentally
investigated in exchange-coupled potassium split graphene nanoribbons (GNRs).
We find that, at low field sweep rate, the pronounced absolute training effect
is present over a large number of cycles. This is reflected in a gradual
decrease of the exchange bias with the sequential field cycling. However, at
high field sweep rate above 0.5 T/min, the training effect is not prominent.
With the increase in field sweep rate, the average value of exchange bias field
grows and is found to follow power law behavior. The response of the exchange
bias field to the field sweep rate variation is linked to the difference in the
time it takes to perform a hysteresis loop measurement compared with the
relaxation time of the anti-ferromagnetically aligned spins. The present
results may broaden our current understanding of magnetism of GNRs and would be
helpful in establishing the GNRs based spintronic devices.

affect their interpretation for studies of disordered systems, and offer a

considers the geometrical arrangement of a set of neighboring spheres NN(p)

neighborhood implies that NN(p) is not a continuous function of the particle

of the ql as structure metrics. Both issues can be avoided by a morphometric
approach leading to the robust Minkowski structure metrics ql'. These ql' are

lambs and wolves - as proposed by Doddington and Yager in the so-called
Biometric Menagerie, are at most fuzzy and at least not quite well defined.
They depend not only on the users or on their biometric templates, but also on
the parameters that calibrate the iris recognition system. This paper shows
that, in the case of iris recognition, the extensions of these concepts have
very unsharp and unstable (non-stationary) boundaries. The membership of a user
to these categories is more often expressed as a degree (as a fuzzy value)
rather than as a crisp value. Moreover, they are defined by fuzzy Sugeno rules
instead of classical (crisp) definitions. For these reasons, we said that the
Biometric Menagerie proposed by Doddington and Yager could be at most a fuzzy
concept of biometry, but even this status is conditioned by improving its
definition. All of these facts are confirmed experimentally in a series of 12
exhaustive iris recognition tests undertaken for University of Bath Iris Image
Database while using three different iris code dimensions (256x16, 128x8 and
64x4), two different iris texture encoders (Log-Gabor and Haar-Hilbert) and two

viscous string model in early and late stages of the evolution of the universe.
This paper presents the different string models like geometrical (Nambu
string), Takabayashi (p-string) and Reddy string models by taking certain
physical conditions. We discuss the nature of the classical potential for
viscous fluid with and without magnetic field. We find that the introduction of
bulk viscosity with and without magnetic field results in rapid change in
density parameters and in the classical potential. The presence of bulk
viscosity prevents the universe to be empty in its future evolution. The other
physical and geometrical aspects of each string model are discussed in detail.

electric current, current helicity, source field, photospheric free energy, and
angular shear, are calculated in this work to quantify the non-potentiality of
NOAA AR 11158. Benefited from high spatial resolution, high cadence, and
continuously temporal coverage of vector magnetograms from the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, both the long-term
evolution of the AR and the rapid change during flares have been studied. We
confirmed that, comparing with the magnetic flux, the magnetic non-potentiality
has a closer connection with the flare, and the emerging flux regions are
important for the magnetic non-potentiality and flares. The main results of
this work are as follows. (1) The vortex in the source field directly displays
the deflection of horizontal magnetic field. The deflection is corresponding to
the fast rotated sunspot with a time delay, which suggests that the sunspot
rotation leads to an increase of the non-potentiality. (2) Two areas that have
evident changes of the azimuth of the vector magnetic field are found near the
magnetic polarity inversion line. The change rates of the azimuth are about 1.3
deg/h and 3.6 deg/h, respectively. (3) Rapid and prominent increases are found
in the variation of helicity during four flares in their initial brightening
regions. The recovery of the increases takes 3-4 h for the two biggest flares
(X2.2 and M6.6), while only takes about 2 h for the other two smaller flares

provides continuous information on the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to

observed Ca II H spectra assuming LTE. We developed an inversion strategy based
on the SIR code. The approach uses a two-step procedure with an archive of
pre-calculated spectra to fit the line core and a subsequent iterative
modification to improve the fit in the line wing. Simultaneous spectra in the
630nm range can optionally be used to fix the continuum temperature. The method
retrieves 1D temperature stratifications neglecting lateral radiative
transport. LOS velocities are included by an empirical approach. An archive of
about 300.000 pre-calculated spectra is more than sufficient to reproduce the
line core of observed Ca II H spectra both in quiet Sun and in active regions.
The final thermodynamical stratifications match observed and best-fit spectra
to a level of about 0.5 (1) % of Ic in the line wing (core). Inversion schemes
based on pre-calculated spectra allow one a reliable and relatively fast
retrieval of solar properties from observed chromospheric spectra. The approach
can be easily extended to an 1D NLTE case by a simple exchange of the
pre-calculated archive spectra.

push car movement from a superballistic down to a subdiffusive state. The
transition is also associated with a change in the shape of the probability
distribution of positions from negatively-skewed normal to an exponential
distribution. Moreover, crowding broadens the distribution of cars' trap times

there is a large variability in car speeds. We further relate our work to prior

biological processes on a microscopic molecule-by-molecule basis. Recent
single-molecule biophysical experiments on enzyme systems, in particular,
reveal that enzyme molecules behave fundamentally differently from what
classical model predicts. A stochastic network model was previously proposed to
explain the experimental discovery. This paper conducts detailed theoretical
and data analyses of the stochastic network model, focusing on the correlation
structure of the successive reaction times of a single enzyme molecule. We
investigate the correlation of experimental fluorescence intensity and the
correlation of enzymatic reaction times, and examine the role of substrate
concentration in enzymatic reactions. Our study shows that the stochastic
network model is capable of explaining the experimental data in depth.

distribution actually follows a shifted power-law distribution, so-called

this paper, we propose an evolving model, considering two different user

two real bipartite networks, \emph{Delicious} and \emph{CiteULike}, show that
the theoretical model can well characterize the structure of real networks for
both user and object degree distributions. In addition, we introduce a
structural parameter $p$, to demonstrate that the hybrid user behavior leads to
the shifted power-law degree distribution, and the region of power-law tail
will increase with the increment of $p$. The proposed model might shed some
lights in understanding the underlying laws governing the structure of real
online bipartite networks.

improve/adapt protocols for functional rehabilitation among those who show
deficits in maintaining posture, typically seniors. Here, we specifically
tackle the statistical problem of classifying subjects sampled from a two-class
population. Each subject (enrolled in a cohort of 54 participants) undergoes
four experimental protocols which are designed to evaluate potential deficits
in maintaining posture. These protocols result in four complex trajectories,
from which we can extract four small-dimensional summary measures. Because
undergoing several protocols can be unpleasant, and sometimes painful, we try
to limit the number of protocols needed for the classification. Therefore, we
first rank the protocols by decreasing order of relevance, then we derive four
plug-in classifiers which involve the best (i.e., more informative), the two
best, the three best and all four protocols. This two-step procedure relies on
the cutting-edge methodologies of targeted maximum likelihood learning (a
methodology for robust and efficient inference) and super-learning (a machine
learning procedure for aggregating various estimation procedures into a single
better estimation procedure). A simulation study is carried out. The
performances of the procedure applied to the real data set (and evaluated by
the leave-one-out rule) go as high as an 87% rate of correct classification (47
out of 54 subjects correctly classified), using only the best protocol.

co-added image stacking technique, in which our aim is to detect the optical
emission from unresolved, isolated radio sources of the Very Large Array (VLA)
Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey that have no
identified optical counterparts in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe
82 co-added data set. From the FIRST catalogue, 2116 such radio point sources
were selected, and cut-out images, centred on the FIRST coordinates, were
generated from the Stripe 82 images. The already co-added cut-outs were stacked
once again to obtain images of high signal-to-noise ratio, in the hope that
optical emission from the radio sources would become detectable. Multiple
stacks were generated, based on the radio luminosity of the point sources. The
resulting stacked images show central peaks similar to point sources. The peaks
have very red colours with steep optical spectral energy distributions. We have
found that the optical spectral index alpha_nu falls in the range -2.9 <
alpha_nu < -2.2, depending only weakly on the radio flux. The total integration
times of the stacks are between 270 and 300 h, and the corresponding 5 sigma
detection limit is estimated to be about m_r = 26.6 mag. We argue that the
detected light is mainly from the central regions of dust-reddened Type 1
active galactic nuclei. Dust-reddened quasars might represent an early phase of
quasar evolution, and thus they can also give us an insight into the formation
of massive galaxies. The data used in the paper are available on-line at

inference in hard-to-reach human populations. Typically, a sampling frame is
not available, and population members are difficult to identify or recruit from
broader sampling frames. Common examples include injecting drug users, men who
have sex with men, and female sex workers. Most analysis of RDS data has
focused on estimating aggregate characteristics, such as disease prevalence.
However, RDS is often conducted in settings where the population size is
unknown and of great independent interest. This paper presents an approach to
estimating the size of a target population based on data collected through RDS.
  The proposed approach uses a successive sampling approximation to RDS to
leverage information in the ordered sequence of observed personal network
sizes. The inference uses the Bayesian framework, allowing for the
incorporation of prior knowledge. A flexible class of priors for the population
size is proposed that aids elicitation. An extensive simulation study provides
insight into the performance of the method for estimating population size under
a broad range of conditions. A further study shows the approach also improves
estimation of aggregate characteristics. A particular choice of the prior
produces interval estimates with good frequentist properties. Finally, the
method demonstrates sensible results when used to estimate the numbers of
sub-populations most at risk for HIV in two cities in El Salvador.

Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) scans for experimental populations. Using a
standard brute-force exhaustive search effectively prohibits accurate QTL scans

permutation testing is used to determine significance. Some more elaborate
global optimization approaches, e.g. DIRECT, have earlier been adopted to QTL
search problems. Dramatic speedups have been reported for high-dimensional
scans. However, since a heuristic termination criterion must be used in these
types of algorithms the accuracy of the optimization process cannot be
guaranteed. Indeed, earlier results show that a small bias in the significance
thresholds is sometimes introduced.
  Our new optimization scheme, PruneDIRECT, is based on an analysis leading to
a computable (Lipschitz) bound on the slope of a transformed objective
function. The bound is derived for both infinite size and finite size
populations. Introducing a Lipschitz bound in DIRECT leads to an algorithm
related to classical Lipschitz optimization. Regions in the search space can be
permanently excluded (pruned) during the optimization process. Heuristic
termination criteria can thus be avoided. Hence, PruneDIRECT has a well-defined
error bound and can in practice be guaranteed to be equivalent to a
corresponding exhaustive search. We present simulation results that show that
for simultaneous mapping of three QTL using permutation testing, PruneDIRECT is
typically more than 50 times faster than exhaustive search. The speedup is
higher for stronger QTL. This could be used to quickly detect strong candidate
eQTL networks.

superconducting protons and superfluid neutrons. Theoretical estimates suggest
that the protons will form a type II superconductor in which the stellar
magnetic field is carried by flux tubes. The strong interaction between the
flux tubes and the neutron rotational vortices could lead to strong 'pinning',
i.e. vortex motion could be impeded. This has important implications especially
for pulsar glitch models as it would lead to a large part of the vorticity of
the star being decoupled from the 'normal' component, to which the
electromagnetic emission is locked. In this paper we explore the consequences
of strong pinning in the core on the 'snowplow' model for pulsar glitches
(Pizzochero 2011), making use of realistic equations of state and relativistic
background models for the neutron star. We find that in general a large
fraction of pinned vorticity in the core is not compatible with observations of
giant glitches in the Vela pulsar. The conclusion is thus that either most of
the core is in a type I superconducting state or that the interaction between
vortices and flux tubes is weaker than previously assumed.

complete suppression of oscillations, formally termed amplitude death (AD).
Oscillations of the entire system cease as a consequence of the interaction,
leading to stationary behavior. The fixed points that the coupling stabilizes
can be the otherwise unstable fixed points of the uncoupled system or can
correspond to novel stationary points. Such behaviour is of relevance in areas
ranging from laser physics to the dynamics of biological systems. In this
review we discuss the characteristics of the different coupling strategies and
scenarios that lead to AD in a variety of different situations, and draw
attention to several open issues and challenging problems for further study.

principle of quantum mechanics, as formulated by the Feynman path integral, is
taken as a starting point. It is argued that the trajectories that enter this
path integral are distinct, despite any quantum uncertainty in geometry, and
thus that space-time topology is multiply connected. Specifically, space-time
at the Planck scale consists of a lattice of three-tori that facilitates many
distinct paths for particles to travel along. To add gravity, mini black holes
are attached to this lattice. These mini black holes represent Wheeler's
quantum foam and result from the fact that GR is not conformally invariant. The
stable creation of such mini black holes is found to be caused by the existence
of macroscopic (so long-lived) black holes. This connection, by which
macroscopic black holes induce mini black holes, is a topological expression of
Mach's principle. The proposed topological extension of GR can be tested
because, if correct, the dark energy density of the universe should be linearly
proportional to the total number of macroscopic black holes in the universe at
any time. This prediction, although strange, agrees with current astrophysical
observations.

region faster their largest Fourier component. While such signals have many
scientific and technological applications, their actual use is hampered by the
fact that an overwhelming proportion of the energy goes into that part of the
signal, which is not superoscillating. In the present article we consider the
problem of optimization of such signals. The optimization that we describe here
is that of the superoscillation yield, the ratio of the energy in the
superoscillations to the total energy of the signal, given the range and
frequency of the superoscillations. The constrained optimization leads to a
generalized eigenvalue problem, which is solved numerically. It is noteworthy
that it is possible to increase further the superoscillation yield at the cost
of slightly deforming the oscillatory part of the signal, while keeping the
average frequency. We show, how this can be done gradually, which enables a
trade-off between the distortion and the yield. We show how to apply this
approach to non-trivial domains, and explain how to generalize this to higher
dimensions.

various problems of science and engineering. Different authors have used
various methods to solve governing differential equation of heat conduction

which is made up of two different materials viz. aluminum and copper. In
earlier studies parameters in the differential equation have been taken as
fixed (crisp) numbers which actually may not. Those parameters are found in
general by some measurements or experiments. So the material properties are
actually uncertain and may be considered to vary in an interval or as fuzzy and
in that case complex interval arithmetic or fuzzy arithmetic has to be
considered in the analysis. As such the problem is discretized into finite
number of elements which depend on interval/fuzzy parameters. Representation of
interval/fuzzy numbers may give the clear picture of uncertainty. Hence
interval/fuzzy arithmetic is applied in the finite element method to solve a
steady state heat conduction problem. Application of fuzzy finite element
method in the said problem gives fuzzy system of linear equations in general.
Here new methods have also been proposed to handle such type of fuzzy system of
linear equations. Corresponding results are computed and has been reported
here.

low-efficient renal clearance and only 1% of gold can be cleared, but the

gold can be cleared after 24 hours. The biodistribution further reveals that
94% of gold can be metabolized for the GSH-protected nanoclusters, but only
less than 5% of gold can be metabolized for the BSA-protected nanoclusters
after 28 days. Both of the GSH- and BSA-protected gold nanoclusters cause acute

toxicity responses for the GSH-protected gold nanoclusters can be eliminated

thus the toxicity can be significantly decreased. The BSA- protected gold
nanoclusters, however, can form large compounds and further accumulate in liver
