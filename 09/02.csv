variational principle of classical mechanics. This principle yields an
alternative derivation of the covariant Euler-Poincar\'e equations that
naturally includes covariant Clebsch variables via multisymplectic momentum
maps. In the case of diffeomorphism groups, this approach gives a new
interpretation of recently derived singular peakon solutions of Diff(R)-strand
equations, and allows for the construction of singular solutions (such as
filaments or sheets) for a more general class of equations, called covariant
EPDiff equations. The relation between the covariant Clebsch principle and
other variational principles arising in mechanics and field theories, such as
Hamilton-Pontryagin principles, is explained through the introduction of a
class of covariant Pontryagin variational principles in field theories.

structure often assume that neurons are only selective for a small number of

recent modeling approaches where the neural response depends on the quadratic
form of the input rather than on its linear projection, that is, the neuron is
sensitive to the local covariance structure of the signal preceding the spike.
To infer this quadratic dependence in the presence of arbitrary (e.g.
naturalistic) stimulus distribution, we review several inference methods,
focussing in particular on two information-theory-based approaches
(maximization of stimulus energy or of noise entropy) and a likelihood-based
approach (Bayesian spike-triggered covariance, extensions of generalized linear
models). We analyze the formal connection between the likelihood-based and
information-based approaches to show how they lead to consistent inference. We
demonstrate the practical feasibility of these procedures by using model
neurons responding to a flickering variance stimulus.

neutrinos from CERN at an average energy of about 20 GeV, after a flight path
of about 730 km. The LSND anomaly would manifest as an excess of nu_e events,
characterized by a fast energy oscillation averaging approximately to
sin^2(1.27 Dm^2_new L/ E_nu) = 1/2. The present analysis is based on 1091
neutrino events, which are about 50% of the ICARUS data collected in 2010-2011.
Two clear nu_e events have been found, compared with the expectation of 3.7 +/-
0.6 events from conventional sources. Within the range of our observations,
this result is compatible with the absence of a LSND anomaly. At 90% and 99%
confidence levels the limits of 3.4 and 7.3 events corresponding to oscillation
probabilities of 5.4 10^-3 and 1.1 10^-2 are set respectively. The result
strongly limits the window of open options for the LSND anomaly to a narrow
region around (Dm^2, sin^2(2 theta))_new = (0.5 eV^2, 0.005), where there is an
overall agreement (90% CL) between the present ICARUS limit, the published

observed failed eruptions. EUV images were compared to HXR spatial distribution
reconstructed from Yohkoh/HXT and RHESSI data. The EUV light curves of a
selected area were compared to height profiles of eruption, HXR emission and
HXR photon spectral index of power-law fit to HXR data. We have found that EUV
brightenings are closely related to the eruption velocity decrease, to HXR
bursts and to episodes of hardening of HXR spectra. The EUV brightened areas
are observed far from the flaring structure, in footpoints of large systems of
loops observed 30-60 minutes after the maximum of a flare. These are not
`post-flare' loops that are also observed but at significantly lower heights.
The high lying systems of loops are observed at heights equal to height, at
which eruption was observed to stop. We observed HXR source spatially
correlated with EUV brightening only once. For other EUV brightened areas we
estimated the expected brightness of HXR sources. We find that EUV brightenings
are produced due to interaction between the erupting structure with overlying
loops. The interaction is strong enough to heat the system of high loops. These
loops cool down and are visible in EUV range about 30-60 minutes later. The
estimated brightness of HXR sources associated with EUV brightenings shows that
they are too weak to be detected with present instruments. However, next
generation instruments will have enough dynamic range and sensitivity to enable
such observations.

generalization and categorification of von Neumann algebra. A von Neumann
category is a premonoidal category with compatible dagger structure which
embeds as a double commutant into a suitable premonoidal category of Hilbert
spaces.
  The notion was inspired by algebraic quantum field theory. In AQFT, one
assigns to open regions in Minkowski space a C*-algebra, called the local
algebra. The local algebras are patched together to form a global algebra
associated to the AQFT. The key relativistic assumption is Einstein Causality,
which says that the algebras associated to spacelike separated regions commute
in the global algebra. Premonoidal categories provide a natural framework for
lifting such structure from algebras to categories. Thus von Neumann categories
serve as a basis for extending the abstract quantum mechanics of Abramsky and
Coecke to include relativistic effects.
  In this paper, we focus on the structure of von Neumann categories. After
giving the basic definitions and examples, we consider constructions typically
associated to von Neumann algebras, and examine their extensions to the
category setting. In particular, we present a crossed product construction for
*-premonoidal categories.

analysis of Ty families in S. cerevisiae based on a reannotation of Ty elements
in the S288c reference genome. We show that previous annotation efforts have
underestimated the total copy number of Ty elements for all known families. In
addition, we identify a new family of Ty3-like elements related to the S.
paradoxus Ty3p which is composed entirely of degenerate solo LTRs. Phylogenetic
analyses of LTR sequences identified three families with short-branch, recently
active clades nested among long branch, inactive insertions (Ty1, Ty3, Ty4),
one family with essentially all recently active elements (Ty2) and two families
with only inactive elements (Ty3p and Ty5). Population genomic data from 38
additional strains of S. cerevisiae show that elements present in active clades
are predominantly polymorphic, whereas most of the inactive elements are fixed.
Finally, we use comparative genomic data to provide evidence that the Ty2 and
Ty3p families have arisen in the S. cerevisiae genome by horizontal transfer.
Our results demonstrate that the genome of a single individual contains
important information about the state of TE population dynamics within a
species and suggest that horizontal transfer may play an important role in
shaping the diversity of transposable elements in unicellular eukaryotes.

the last neutron, in 5Li is caused by opposite roles of the tensor correlation.
In 6Li, the spin-triplet state in the LS coupling configuration is favored
energetically by the tensor force in comparison with jj coupling shell model
states. In 7,8,9Li, the low-lying states containing extra neutrons in the p3/2
orbit are favored energetically due to the large tensor contribution to allow
the excitation from the 0s orbit to the p1/2 orbit by the tensor force. Those
three nuclei show the jj coupling character in their ground states which is
different from 6Li.

has a natural interpretation on flat para-K\""ahler manifolds. In this paper, we
show that the same geometric constructions can be made on any para-Hermitian
manifold. The field is interpreted as a compatible (pseudo-)Riemannian metric.
The tangent bundle of the manifold has a natural, metric-compatible bracket
that extends the C-bracket of double field theory. In the para-K\""ahler case
this bracket is equal to the sum of the Courant brackets of the two Lagrangian
foliations of the manifold. Then, we define a canonical connection and an
action of the field that correspond to similar objects of double field theory.
Another section is devoted to the Marsden-Weinstein reduction in double field
theory on para-Hermitian manifolds. Finally, we give examples of fields on some
well-known para-Hermitian manifolds.

structure of the century-old equatorial ejecta, that is not fully spatially
resolved by observations, we limit ourselves to modelling the equatorial dense
gas by one or two dense spherical clouds. Because of that we reproduce the
general qualitative properties of the velocity maps, but not the fine details.
The fine details of the velocity maps can be matched by simply structuring the
dense ejecta in an appropriate way. The blue and red-shifted components are
formed in the post-shock flow of the primary wind, on the two sides of the
equatorial plane, respectively. The fast wind from the secondary star plays no
role in our model, as for most of the orbital period in our model the primary
star is closer to us. The dense clouds are observed to be closer to us than the

great attention and are used in almost every field of research including
biomedical. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are one of the Computer- Aided-
Diagnosis tools which are used extensively by advances in computer hardware
technology. The application of these techniques for disease diagnosis has made
great progress and is widely used by physicians. An Electrocardiogram carries
vital information about heart activity and physicians use this signal for
cardiac disease diagnosis which was the great motivation towards our study.
Methods: In this study we are using Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) as an
automatic technique for ECG signal analysis along with a Genetic Algorithm
(GA). As every real signal recorded by the equipment can have different
artifacts, we need to do some preprocessing steps before feeding it to the ANN.
Wavelet transform is used for extracting the morphological parameters and
median filter for data reduction of the ECG signal. The subset of morphological
parameters are chosen and optimized using GA. We had two approaches in our
investigation, the first one uses the whole signal with 289 normalized and
de-noised data points as input to the ANN. In the second approach after
applying all the preprocessing steps the signal is reduced to 29 data points
and also their important parameters extracted to form the ANN input with 35
data points. Results: The outcome of the two approaches for 8 types of
arrhythmia shows that the second approach is superior than the first one with
an average accuracy of %99.42.

clusters of galaxies, core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), planetary nebulae
(PNe), and common envelope (CE) evolution. The similarities include hot bubbles
inflated by jets in a bipolar structure, vortices on the sides of the jets,
vortices inside the inflated bubbles, fragmentation of bubbles to two and more
bubbles, and buoyancy of bubbles. The activity in many cases is regulated by a
negative feedback mechanism. Namely, higher accretion rate leads to stronger
jet activity that in turn suppresses the accretion process. After the jets
power decreases the accretion resumes, and the cycle restarts. In the case of
CF in galaxies and clusters of galaxies we also study the accretion process,
which is most likely by cold clumps, i.e., the cold feedback mechanism. In CF
clusters we find that heating of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) is done by
mixing hot shocked jet gas with the ICM, and not by shocks. Our results
strengthen the jet feedback mechanism (JFM) as a common process in many
astrophysical objects.

quantitatively the main components affecting genome size, structure and

factors varying in strength and nature along the genome. We address here how TE
sequence evolution is affected by neighboring genes and the chromatin status
(euchromatin or heterochromatin) at their insertion site. Results: We estimated
ages of TE sequences in Arabidopsis thaliana, and found that they depend on the
distance to the nearest genes: TEs located close to genes are older than those
that are more distant. Consequently, TE sequences in heterochromatic regions,
which are gene-poor regions, are surprisingly younger and longer than that
elsewhere. Conclusions: We provide evidence for biased TE age distribution
close or near to genes. Interestingly, TE sequences in euchromatin and those in
heterochromatin evolve at different rates, and as a result, could explain that
TE sequences in heterochromatin tend to be younger and longer. Then, we revisit
models of TE sequence dynamics and point out differences for TE-rich genomes,
such as maize and wheat, compared to TE-poor genomes such as fly and A.

hierarchies of integrable quantum Hamiltonians and potentials, a general
programme is outlined and applied to its first two simplest illustrations.
Going beyond the usual restriction of shape invariance for intertwined
potentials, it is suggested to require a similar relation for Hamiltonians in
the hierarchy separated by an arbitrary number of levels, N. By requiring
further that these two Hamiltonians be in fact identical up to an overall shift
in energy, a periodic structure is installed in the hierarchy of quantum
systems which should allow for its solution. Specific classes of orthogonal
polynomials characteristic of such periodic hierarchies are thereby generated,
while the methods of Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics then lead to generalised
Rodrigues formulae and recursion relations for such polynomials. The approach
also offers the practical prospect of quantum modelling through the engineering
of quantum potentials from experimental energy spectra. In this paper these
ideas are presented and solved explicitly for the cases N=1 and N=2. The latter
case is related to the generalised Laguerre polynomials, for which indeed new
results are thereby obtained. At the same time new classes of integrable
quantum potentials which generalise that of the harmonic oscillator and which
are characterised by two arbitrary energy gaps are identified, for which a
complete solution is achieved algebraically.
