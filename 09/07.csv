complete Finsler manifolds. On the one hand our result covers a theorem of
Bacher and Sturm concerning euclidean and spherical cones. On the other hand it
can be seen in analogy to a result of Bishop and Alexander in the setting of
Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded from below. For the proof we combine
techniques developed in these papers. Because the Finsler product metric can
degenerate we regard a warped product as metric measure space that is in
general neither a Finsler manifold nor an Alexandrov space again but a space
satisfying a curvature-dimension condition in the sense of Lott-Villani/Sturm.

as yet an unexplained phenomenon. We analyse a well-observed SN of this class,
SN 2009dc, by modelling its photospheric spectra with a spectral synthesis
code, using the technique of 'Abundance Tomography'. We present spectral models
based on different density profiles, corresponding to different explosion
scenarios, and discuss their consistency. First, we use a density structure of
a simulated explosion of a 2 M_sun rotating C-O white dwarf (WD), which is
often proposed as a possibility to explain SC SNe Ia. Then, we test a density
profile empirically inferred from the evolution of line velocities
(blueshifts). This model may be interpreted as a core-collapse SN with an
ejecta mass ~ 3 M_sun. Finally, we calculate spectra assuming an interaction
scenario. In such a scenario, SN 2009dc would be a standard WD explosion with a
normal intrinsic luminosity, and this luminosity would be augmented by
interaction of the ejecta with a H-/He-poor circumstellar medium. We find that
no model tested easily explains SN 2009dc. With the 2 M_sun WD model, our
abundance analysis predicts small amounts of burning products in the
intermediate-/high-velocity ejecta (v > 9000 km/s). However, in the original
explosion simulations, where the nuclear energy release per unit mass is large,
burned material is present at high v. This contradiction can only be resolved
if asymmetries strongly affect the radiative transfer or if C-O WDs with masses
significantly above 2 M_sun exist. In a core-collapse scenario, low velocities
of Fe-group elements are expected, but the abundance stratification in SN
2009dc seems 'SN Ia-like'. The interaction-based model looks promising, and we
have some speculations on possible progenitor configurations. However,
radiation-hydro simulations will be needed to judge whether this scenario is
realistic at all.

delineate regions in which the fit to the measured light-element abundances is
as good as in standard BBN. We also identify regions of the CMSSM parameter
space in which the bound state properties, chemistry and decays of metastable
charged sparticles can solve the cosmological Li7 problem.

corrected luminosity of the source is L(0.2 - 10.0 keV) = 2.5 times 10^{41}

Based on the spectrum and the luminosity, we identify the nuclear X-ray source
in NGC 4561 to be an AGN, with a black hole of mass M_BH > 20,000 solar masses.
The presence of a supermassive black hole at the center of this bulge-less

properties, contrary to the general belief. Observations such as these call
into question several theoretical models of BH--galaxy co-evolution that are
based on merger-driven BH growth; secular processes clearly play an important
role. Several emission lines are detected in the soft X-ray spectrum of the
source which can be well parametrized by an absorbed diffuse thermal plasma
with non-solar abundances of some heavy elements. Similar soft X-ray emission
is observed in spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies and low luminosity AGNs,

populations. We consider a large number of populations, each corresponding to
either distribution P0 or P1. The goal of the search problem studied here is to
find one population corresponding to distribution P1 with as few samples as
possible. The main contribution is to quantify the number of samples needed to
correctly find one such population. We consider two general approaches:
non-adaptive sampling methods, which sample each population a predetermined
number of times until a population following P1 is found, and adaptive sampling
methods, which employ sequential sampling schemes for each population. We first
derive a lower bound on the number of samples required by any sampling scheme.
We then consider an adaptive procedure consisting of a series of sequential
probability ratio tests, and show it comes within a constant factor of the
lower bound. We give explicit expressions for this constant when samples of the
populations follow Gaussian and Bernoulli distributions. An alternative
adaptive scheme is discussed which does not require full knowledge of P1, and
comes within a constant factor of the optimal scheme. For comparison, a lower
bound on the sampling requirements of any non-adaptive scheme is presented.

z~5-10 imply that there were just enough photons to maintain the universe in an
ionized state at z~5-6, indicating a ""photon-starved"" end to reionization. The
ionizing emissivity must have been larger at earlier times in order to yield
the extended reionization history implied by the electron scattering optical
depth constraint from WMAP. Here we address the possibility that a faint
population of galaxies with host halo masses of ~1e8-1e9 Msun dominated the
ionizing photon budget at redshifts of about z>9, due to their much higher
escape fractions. Such faint, early galaxies, would not have formed in ionized
regions due to suppression by heating from the UV background (UVB), and would
therefore not contribute to the ionizing background at z<6, after reionization
is complete. Our model matches: (1) the low escape fractions observed for
high-redshift galaxies, (2) the WMAP constraint of tau_es~0.09, (3) the low
values for the UVB at z<6, and (4) the observed star formation rate density
inferred from Lyman-break galaxies. A top heavy IMF from Pop III stars is not
required in this scenario. We compare our model to recent ones in the
literature that were forced to introduce an escape fraction that increases
strongly towards high redshift, and show that a similar evolution occurs
naturally if low mass galaxies possess high escape fractions.

so-called interchange reconnection, can release the hotter, denser plasma from
magnetically confined regions into the heliosphere, contributing to the
formation of the highly variable slow solar wind. The interchange process is
often thought to develop at the apex of streamers or pseudo-streamers, near Y
and X-type neutral points, but slow streams with loop composition have been
recently observed along fanlike open field lines adjacent to closed regions,
far from the apex. However, coronal heating models, with magnetic field lines
shuffled by convective motions, show that reconnection can occur continuously
in unipolar magnetic field regions with no neutral points: photospheric motions
induce a magnetohydrodynamic turbulent cascade in the coronal field that
creates the necessary small scales, where a sheared magnetic field component
orthogonal to the strong axial field is created locally and can reconnect. We
propose that a similar mechanism operates near and around boundaries between
open and closed regions inducing a continual stochastic rearrangement of
connectivity. We examine a reduced magnetohydrodynamic model of a simplified
interface region between open and closed corona threaded by a strong unipolar
magnetic field. This boundary is not stationary, becomes fractal, and field
lines change connectivity continuously, becoming alternatively open and closed.
This model suggests that slow wind may originate everywhere along loop-coronal
hole boundary regions, and can account naturally and simply for outflows at and
adjacent to such boundaries and for the observed diffusion of slow wind around
the heliospheric current sheet.

H2 based star formation and supernova driven gas outflows. The 18 simulated
halos have masses ranging from a few times 10^8 to nearly 10^12 solar masses.
At z=0 our simulated galaxies have a baryon content and morphology typical of
field galaxies. Over a stellar mass range of 2.2 x 10^3 to 4.5 x 10^10 solar
masses, we find extremely good agreement between the SHM ratio in simulations
and the present-day predictions from the statistical Abundance Matching
Technique presented in Moster et al. (2012). This improvement over past
simulations is due to a number systematic factors, each decreasing the SHM
ratios: 1) gas outflows that reduce the overall SF efficiency but allow for the
formation of a cold gas component 2) estimating the stellar masses of simulated
galaxies using artificial observations and photometric techniques similar to
those used in observations and 3) accounting for a systematic, up to 30 percent
overestimate in total halo masses in DM-only simulations, due to the neglect of
baryon loss over cosmic times. Our analysis suggests that stellar mass
estimates based on photometric magnitudes can underestimate the contribution of
old stellar populations to the total stellar mass, leading to stellar mass
errors of up to 50 percent for individual galaxies. These results highlight the
importance of using proper techniques to compare simulations with observations
and reduce the perceived tension between the star formation efficiency in
galaxy formation models and in real galaxies.

(SMGs) drawn from an ALMA study of the 126 sub-millimeter sources from the

the counterparts to these previously unidentified sub-millimeter sources and
serendipitously detect bright emission lines in their spectra which we show are
most likely to be [C II]157.74um emission yielding redshifts of z=4.42 and
z=4.44. This blind detection rate within the 7.5-GHz bandpass of ALMA is
consistent with the previously derived photometric redshift distribution of
SMGs and suggests a modest, but not dominant (<25%), tail of 870-um selected
SMGs at z>4. We find that the ratio of L_CII/L_FIR in these SMGs is much higher
than seen for similarly far-infrared-luminous galaxies at z~0, which is
attributed to the more extended gas reservoirs in these high-redshift ULIRGs.
Indeed, in one system we show that the [C II] emission shows hints of extended
emission on >3kpc scales. Finally, we use the volume probed by our ALMA survey
to show that the bright end of the [C II] luminosity function evolves strongly
between z=0 and z~4.4, reflecting the increased ISM cooling in galaxies as a
result of their higher star-formation rates. These observations demonstrate
that even with short integrations, ALMA is able to detect the dominant fine
structure cooling lines from high-redshift ULIRGs, measure their energetics and
trace their evolution with redshift.

universal, with a mean <gamma_tot> = 1.16 +- 0.05 (random) +0.05-0.07
(systematic) and an intrinsic scatter of < 0.13 (68% confidence). This is
further supported by the very homogeneous shape of the observed velocity
dispersion profiles, obtained via Keck spectroscopy, which are mutually
consistent after a simple scaling. Remarkably, this slope agrees closely with
numerical simulations that contain only dark matter, despite the significant
contribution of stellar mass on the scales we probe. The Navarro-Frenk-White
profile characteristic of collisionless cold dark matter is a better
description of the total mass density at radii >~ 5-10 kpc than that of dark
matter alone. Hydrodynamical simulations that include baryons, cooling, and
feedback currently provide a poorer match. We discuss the significance of our
findings for understanding the assembly of BCGs and cluster cores, particularly
the influence of baryons on the inner DM halo. [abridged]

seven massive, relaxed galaxy clusters derived from strong and weak
gravitational lensing and resolved stellar kinematic observations within the
centrally-located brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). In Paper I of the series,
we demonstrated that the total density profile derived from these data, which
span 3 decades in radius, is consistent with numerical DM-only simulations at
radii >~ 5-10 kpc, despite the significant contribution of stellar material in
the core. Here we decompose the inner mass profiles of these clusters into
stellar and dark components. Parametrizing the DM density profile as a power
law rho_DM ~ r^{-\beta} on small scales, we find a mean slope <\beta> = 0.50 +-
0.10 (random) +0.14-0.13 (systematic). Alternatively, cored Navarro-Frenk-White
(NFW) profiles with <log r_core/kpc> = 1.14 +- 0.13 (random) +0.14-0.22
(systematic) provide an equally good description. These density profiles are
significantly shallower than canonical NFW models at radii <~ 30 kpc,
comparable to the effective radii of the BCGs. The inner DM profile is
correlated with the distribution of stars in the BCG, suggesting a connection
between the inner halo and the assembly of stars in the central galaxy. The
stellar mass-to-light ratio inferred from lensing and stellar dynamics is
consistent with that inferred using stellar population synthesis models if a
Salpeter initial mass function is adopted. We compare these results to theories
describing the interaction between baryons and DM in cluster cores, including
adiabatic contraction models and the possible effects of galaxy mergers and
active galactic nucleus feedback, and evaluate possible signatures of
alternative DM candidates.

Accepted to ApJ Letters",,"10.1088/2041-8205/757/2/L24",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that in realistic cases of accretion in active galactic nuclei or
stellar-mass X-ray binaries, the Lense-Thirring effect breaks the central
regions of tilted accretion discs around spinning black holes into a set of
distinct planes with only tenuous flows connecting them. If the original
misalignment of the outer disc to the spin axis of the hole is $45^{\circ}
\lesssim \theta \lesssim 135^{\circ}$, as in $\sim 70$% of randomly oriented
accretion events, the continued precession of these discs sets up partially
counter-rotating gas flows. This drives rapid infall as angular momentum is
cancelled and gas attempts to circularize at smaller radii. Disc breaking close
to the black hole leads to direct dynamical accretion, while breaking further
out can drive gas down to scales where it can accrete rapidly. For smaller tilt
angles breaking can still occur, and may lead to other observable phenomena
such as QPOs. For such effects not to appear, the black hole spin must in
practice be negligibly small, or be almost precisely aligned with the disc.
Qualitatively similar results hold for any accretion disc subject to a forced
differential precession, such as an external disc around a misaligned black
hole binary.

constant \alpha and the electron mass m_e in the early universe, and study the
degeneracies between these constants and other cosmological parameters, such as
the dark energy equation of state parameter w_DE, the massive neutrinos
fraction f_\nu, the effective number of relativistic species N_eff, and the
primordial helium abundance Y_He. When only one of the fundamental constants is

consistent with a cosmological constant, when \alpha is treated as a free

while for m_e variation, we obtain f_nu < 0.086 (95% CL), which implies \sum
m_\nu < 1.1 eV (95% CL). When N_eff or Y_He are considered as free parameters,
their simultaneous variation with \alpha provides constraints close to their
standard values (when the H_0 prior is not included in the analysis), while
when m_e is allowed to vary, their preferred values are significantly higher.

B-band magnitudes and stellar masses to investigate the evolution of the B-band

thus making the use of a large number of base station antennas potentially
suitable also for Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) systems, for which

space due to the reduced background. Redshift surveys with WFC3-IR offer probes
of the astrophysics of the galaxy population at z=1-3 from line features, and
the true redshift and spatial distribution of galaxies, that cannot be done
with photometric surveys alone. While HST slitless spectroscopy is low spectral
resolution, its high multiplex advantage makes it competitive with future
ground based IR spectrographs, its flux calibration is stable, and its high
spatial resolution allows measuring the spatial extent of emission lines, which
only HST can do currently for large numbers of objects. A deeper slitless IR
spectroscopic survey over hundreds of arcmin^2 (eg one or more GOODS fields) is
one of the remaining niches for large galaxy evolution studies with HST, and
would produce a sample of thousands of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at

of some configurations of the method, as a consequence of internal aliasing. We
provide precise conditions, based on the chosen polynomial basis and quadrature
rules, under which this aliasing error occurs. We then establish theoretical
results on the accuracy of Smolyak pseudospectral approximation, and show that
the Smolyak approximation avoids internal aliasing and makes far more effective
use of sparse function evaluations. These results are applicable to broad
choices of quadrature rule and generalized sparse grids. Exploiting this
flexibility, we introduce a greedy heuristic for adaptive refinement of the
pseudospectral approximation. We numerically demonstrate convergence of the
algorithm on the Genz test functions, and illustrate the accuracy and
efficiency of the adaptive approach on a realistic chemical kinetics problem.

because their inclusion in the amplitude leads to a theoretical error in the
extraction of 2beta_s from the data. In the standard model (SM), it is

we show that, using a modification of the angular analysis currently used to

continuum shape, emission-line measurements of C IV, Al III, C III], Fe II, and

emission, which is consistent with what is found for radio-quiet BAL sources.
No correlations exist between outflow properties and orientation (radio

takes years of sophisticated planning to provision and deploy a warehouse;
adding new hardware resources to an existing warehouse is an equally lengthy

  Additionally, modern data analysis employs statistical methods that go well
beyond the typical roll-up and drill-down capabilities provided by warehouse

of SQL and UDFs, query engines in relational databases are ill-suited for
these.
  The Hadoop ecosystem introduces a suite of tools for data analytics that
overcome some of the problems of traditional solutions. These systems, however,
forgo years of warehouse research. Memory is significantly underutilized in
Hadoop clusters, and execution engine is naive compared with its relational
counterparts.
  It is time to rethink the design of data warehouse systems and take the best

distributed power control policy. The fading models considered to derive
sum-rate scaling laws are general enough to include Rayleigh, Rician and
Nakagami fading models as special cases. When transmissions of secondary users
are limited by both transmission and interference power constraints, it is
shown that the secondary network sum-rate scales according to
$\frac{1}{\e{}n_h}\log\logp{N}$, where $n_h$ is a parameter obtained from the
distribution of direct channel power gains. For the case of transmissions
limited only by interference constraints, on the other hand, the secondary
network sum-rate scales according to $\frac{1}{\e{}\gamma_g}\logp{N}$, where
$\gamma_g$ is a parameter obtained from the distribution of interference
channel power gains. These results indicate that the distributed cognitive
uplink is able to achieve throughput scaling behavior similar to that of the
centralized cognitive uplink up to a pre-log multiplier $\frac{1}{\e{}}$,
whilst primary's quality-of-service requirements are met. The factor
$\frac{1}{\e{}}$ can be interpreted as the cost of distributed implementation
of the cognitive uplink.

have clearly shown that something like 50 per cent of stars of spectral types G
and F occur in multiple systems. For earlier spectral types, the incidence of
multiplicity is even higher. Thus, a volume limited sample of white dwarfs
should reflect the percentage of binarity observed in stars of F to late B
spectral types, which are their Main Sequence progenitors. However, a study of
the local volume limited sample of white dwarfs (20 pc from the Sun) conducted
by Holberg has shown that a white dwarf has a probability of only $\sim 32$ per
cent of occurring in a binary system, in stark contrast to the observations of
multiplicity of Main Sequence stars. Others studies have also led to the same
conclusion.
  In this paper, we argue that the ""hidden"" white dwarfs are either in double
white dwarf systems or in Sirius-like systems. We also show that the white
dwarf progenitors of the SDSS white dwarf - M dwarf wide binaries are
distributed according to Salpeter's IMF. However, they cannot be paired with
secondary stars which are also drawn from this IMF, since such a pairing would
produce a percentage of white dwarf-M dwarfs systems that is several times
larger than observed.

predicts a local enhancement of the vertical Poynting flux within a small

Since the accuracy of the solution may become rather poor in such inner

the present paper, we develop a sophisticated discussion for the appearance of
jet-driving circumstances, based on a much more firm ground by deriving a
global solution in the same situation. Although the new solution still has an
approximate nature, it becomes exact in the limits not only of large radius but

efficiency can be higher if the excitation beam can match the intrinsic
emission well and the radiation loss can be tuned by adjusting the degree of

that the asymmetric and peak like line shapes instead of the Lorentz-shape dip
are universal in transmission spectra due to multi-mode interference, and the
coupling efficiency can not be estimated from the absolute depth of the dip.

between the earliest stages in the evolution of life and the RNA repertoires of
extant lineages. Some assessments seem consistent with a diverse RNA world, yet
direct continuity between modern RNAs and an RNA world has not been
demonstrated for the majority of RNA families, and, anecdotally, many RNA
functions appear restricted in their distribution. Despite much discussion of
the possible antiquity of RNA families, no systematic analyses of RNA family
distribution have been performed. To chart the broad evolutionary history of
known RNA families, we performed comparative genomic analysis of over 3 million
RNA annotations spanning 1446 families from the Rfam 10 database. We report
that 99% of known RNA families are restricted to a single domain of life,
revealing discrete repertoires for each domain. For the 1% of RNA
families/clans present in more than one domain, over half show evidence of
horizontal gene transfer, and the rest show a vertical trace, indicating the
presence of a complex protein synthesis machinery in the Last Universal Common
Ancestor (LUCA) and consistent with the evolutionary history of the most
ancient protein-coding genes. However, with limited interdomain transfer and
few RNA families exhibiting demonstrable antiquity as predicted under RNA world
continuity, our results indicate that the majority of modern cellular RNA

variation to proceed. Yet the G-matrix may have limited 'genetic degrees of
freedom', with certain combinations of trait values unavailable to evolution.
Such limitations are often referred to as genetic constraints. Unfortunately,
clear predictions about when to expect constraints are rarely available.
Therefore, we developed an experimental system that provides specific
predictions regarding constraints. Such tests are important as disagreements
persist regarding the evidence for genetic constraints, possibly due to
differences in methodology, study system or both. Numerous measures of genetic
constraints have been suggested, and generally focus on whether some axes of G
have eigenvalues=~0, indicating a lack of genetic variance.The mutation
Ultrabithorax1 causes a mild homeotic transformation of segmental identity. We
predicted that this mutation would induce a genetic constraint due to this
homeosis. We measured genetic co-variation for a set of traits in a panel of
strains with and without Ubx1. As expected, Ubx1 induced homeotic
transformations, and altered patterns of allometry. Yet, no changes in
correlational structure nor in the distribution of eigenvalues of G were

the interaction terms. Just as for spin 2 and spin 3, the interactions are in
terms of gauge invariant field strengths and the gauge transformations are the

$P_B(p)$ was defined by a contraction-deletion identity, similar to that

diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) or Fermi mechanism, requires seed electrons
with modest energy with gamma ~ 1 - 100, and little is known about this
pre-acceleration mechanism: We derive the energy distribution of relativistic
electrons in this pre-accelerated energy regime. We find that the efficiency of
the electron acceleration must be low, i.e., epsilon_e <~ 0.01 as compared to
the conventionally assumed value of epsilon_e ~ 0.1. Furthermore, independently
from the low value of epsilon_e, we find that the X-ray luminosity cannot be
attributed to any emission mechanisms suggested so far as long as these
electrons follow the conventionally-assumed single power-law distribution. A
consistent view between the radio and X-ray can only be obtained if the
pre-acceleration injection spectrum peaks at gamma ~ 20-30 and then only a
fraction of these electrons eventually experience the DSA-like acceleration
toward the higher energy -- then the radio and X-ray properties are explained
through the synchrotron and inverse Compton mechanisms, respectively. Our
findings support the idea that the pre-acceleration of the electrons is coupled
with the generation/amplification of the magnetic field.

angular momentum, but in a $j$-$j$ coupling scheme, one $f$ electron in $j$=7/2
octet carries quadrupole moment, while other six electrons fully occupy $j$=5/2
sextet, where $j$ denotes one-electron total angular momentum. For realistic
values of Coulomb interaction and spin-orbit coupling, the ground-state

ultrasoft, fully-penetrable particles. These are a binary mixture and a
polydisperse system of particles interacting via the generalized exponential
model, which is known to yield cluster crystal phases for the corresponding
monodisperse systems. Because of the dispersity in the particle size, the
systems investigated in this work do not crystallize and form disordered
cluster phases. The clustering transition appears as a smooth crossover to a
regime in which particles are mostly located in clusters, isolated particles
being infrequent. The analysis of the internal cluster structure reveals
microsegregation of the big and small particles, with a strong
homo-coordination in the binary mixture. Upon further lowering the temperature
below the clustering transition, the motion of the clusters' centers-of-mass
slows down dramatically, giving way to a cluster glass transition. In the
cluster glass, the diffusivities remain finite and display an activated
temperature dependence, indicating that relaxation in the cluster glass occurs
via particle hopping in a nearly arrested matrix of clusters. Finally we
discuss the influence of the microscopic dynamics on the transport properties
by comparing the MD results with Monte Carlo simulations.

dusty gas, driven outwards by radiation pressure, and analyse its
escape/trapping condition in the galactic halo for different underlying dark
matter potentials. In the isothermal potential, we obtain that the standard
condition setting the observed MBH-sigma relation is not sufficient to clear
gas out of the entire galaxy; whereas the same condition is formally sufficient
in the case of the Hernquist and Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. The squeezing
and compression of the inhomogeneous interstellar medium during the ejection
process can trigger star formation within the feedback-driven shell. We
estimate the resulting star formation rate and total additional stellar mass.
In this picture, new stars are formed at increasingly larger radii and
successively populate the outer regions of the host galaxy. This characteristic
pattern may be compared with the observed 'inside-out' growth of massive
galaxies.

strong evidence for this channel can be found at the 14 TeV LHC with 600

production of Higgs boson pairs. This measurement will allow to probe the

will operate in the same energy range as the LAD, enabling simultaneous
monitoring of a few-steradian wide field of view, with an angular resolution of
<5 arcmin. The LAD and WFM experiments will allow us to investigate variability
from submillisecond QPO's to year-long transient outbursts. In this paper we

field of large-area silicon detectors - able to time tag an X-ray photon with

Andromeda galaxy (M31), spanning a range in galactocentric distance from 3.9
kpc to 16.1 kpc. In 9 HII regions we measure one or several auroral lines
([OIII]4363, [NII]5755, [SIII]6312, [OII]7325), from which we determine the
electron temperature (Te) of the gas and derive chemical abundances using the
'direct Te-based method'. We analyze, for the first time in M31, abundance
trends with galactocentric radius from the 'direct' method, and find that the
Ne/O, Ar/O, N/O and S/O abundance ratios are consistent with a constant value
across the M31 disc, while the O/H abundance ratio shows a weak gradient. We
have combined our data with all spectroscopic observations of HII regions in
M31 available in the literature, yielding a sample of 85 HII regions spanning
distances from 3.9 kpc to 24.7 kpc (0.19 - 1.2 R25) from the galaxy center. We
have tested a number of empirical calibrations of strong emission line ratios.
We find that the slope of the oxygen abundance gradient in M31 is
-0.023+/-0.002 dex/kpc, and that the central oxygen abundance is in the range
12+log(O/H) = 8.71 - 8.91 dex (i.e. between 1.05 and 1.66 times the solar
value, for 12+log(O/H)_solar=8.69), depending on the calibration adopted. The
HII region oxygen abundances are compared with the results from other
metallicity indicators (supergiant stars and planetary nebulae). The comparison
shows that HII region O/H abundances are systematically ~0.3 dex below the
stellar ones. This discrepancy is discussed in terms of oxygen depletion onto
dust grains and possible biases affecting Te-based oxygen abundances at high
metallicity.

applied for a handful of other GRBs, fails to describe the observed
column-density evolution in the case of GRB 080310. Inclusion of ionization is
required to explain the column-density decrease of all observed FeII levels
(including the ground state 6D9/2) and increase of the FeIII 7S3 level. The
large population of ions in this latter level (up to 10% of all FeIII) can only
be explained through ionization of FeII, whereby a large fraction of the
ionized FeII ions -- we calculate 31% using the Flexible Atomic (FAC) and Cowan
codes -- initially populate the 7S3 level of FeIII rather than the ground
state. This channel for producing a significant FeIII 7S3 level population may
be relevant for other objects in which absorption lines from this level -- the
UV34 triplet -- are observed, such as BAL quasars and Eta Carinae. This
provides conclusive evidence for time-variable ionization in the circumburst
medium, which to date has not been convincingly detected. However, the best-fit
distance of the neutral absorbing cloud to the GRB is 200--400 pc, i.e. similar
to GRB-absorber distance estimates for GRBs without any evidence for
ionization. We find that the presence of time-varying ionization in GRB 080310
is likely due to a combination of the super-solar iron abundance ([Fe/H]=+0.2)
and the low HI column density (log N(HI)=18.7). [abridged]

mostly studied averaged over discs. Here we study separately breaks in thin and
thick discs in 70 edge-on galaxies using imaging from the Spitzer Survey of
Stellar Structure in Galaxies. We built luminosity profiles of the thin and the
thick discs parallel to midplanes and we found that thin discs often truncate
(77%). Thick discs truncate less often (31%), but when they do, their break
radius is comparable with that in the thin disc. This suggests either two
different truncation mechanisms - one of dynamical origin affecting both discs
simultaneously and another one only affecting the thin disc - or a single
mechanism that creates a truncation in one disc or in both depending on some
galaxy property. Thin discs apparently antitruncate in around 40% of galaxies.
However, in many cases, these antitruncations are an artifact caused by the
superposition of a thin disc and a thick disc with the latter having a longer
scale length. We estimate the real thin disc antitruncation fraction to be less
than 15%. We found that the ratio of the thick and thin stellar disc mass is
roughly constant (0.2<M_T/M_t<0.7) for circular velocities v_c>120 km/s, but
becomes much larger at smaller velocities. We hypothesize that this is due to a
combination of a high efficiency of supernova feedback and a slower dynamical
evolution in lower-mass galaxies causing stellar thin discs to be younger and
less massive than in higher-mass galaxies.

a catalog of 58 objects with estimated values of the $B$ band absolute

possible to define a universal acceleration scale. We find a weak but
statistically meaningful correlation with $M_{vir}$ thus making us argue
against the universality of the acceleration scales. However, the results
somewhat depend on the sample adopted so that a careful analysis of selection

show that the isotope coefficient strongly deviates from the standard BCS value
0.5, when the chemical potential is tuned at the 2.5 Lifshitz transition for
the metal-to-metal transition. The critical temperature Tc shows a minimum due
to the Fano antiresonance in the superconducting gaps and the isotope

causes generally their elongation and locally sp2 -> sp3 rehybridization in the
neighborhood of chemisorbed groups. For adsorbants making particularly strong
covalent bonds with the CNTs(-CH2), we observe formation of the 5/7 defects. In
CNTs functionalized with -CH2,-NH4, and -OH, we determine critical density of
molecules that could be covalently bound to CNTs. Functionalization of CNTs can
be utilized for band gap engineering and also lead to changes in their
metallic/semiconductor character. In semiconducting CNTs, adsorbants such as
-CH3,-NH2,-OH and -COOH, introduce 'impurity' bands in the band gap of pristine
CNTs. In the case of -CH3,-NH2, the induced band gaps are typically smaller
than in the pure CNT and depend strongly on the concentration of adsorbants.
However, functionalization of semiconducting CNTs with -OH leads to the
metallization of CNTs. On the other hand, the functionalization of
semi-metallic (9,0)CNT with -CH2 causes the increase of the band gap and
induces semi-metal to semiconductor transition.

contrarily to common expectations. Quantum correlations in this case arise from
interference between different pathways that the system can follow in the
Hilbert space to reach its steady state under the effect of coherent driving
fields. We characterize in particular two systems: a linear chain of three
coupled cavities and an array of eight coupled cavities. We demonstrate the
existence of a parameter range where the system emits photons with
continuous-variable bipartite and quadripartite entanglement, in the case of
the first and the second system respectively. This entanglement is shown to
survive realistic rates of pure dephasing and opens a new perspective for the
realization of quantum simulators or entangled photon sources without the
challenging requirement of strong optical nonlinearities.

of collisional rate coefficients (CRC) for H$_2$O (with He or H$_2$) which are
necessary to model its rotational excitation and line emission. We performed
accurate non--local non--LTE radiative transfer calculations using different
sets of CRC in order to predict the line intensities from transitions that
involve the lowest energy levels of H$_2$O (E $<$ 900 K). The results obtained
from the different CRC sets are then compared using line intensity ratio
statistics. For the whole range of physical conditions considered in this work,
we obtain that the intensities based on the quantum and QCT CRC are in good
agreement. However, at relatively low H$_2$ volume density ($n$(H$_2$) $<$
10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$) and low water abundance ($\chi$(H$_2$O) $<$ 10$^{-6}$), these
physical conditions being relevant to describe most molecular clouds, we find
differences in the predicted line intensities of up to a factor of $\sim$ 3 for
the bulk of the lines. Most of the recent studies interpreting early Herschel
Space Observatory spectra used the QCT CRC. Our results show that although the
global conclusions from those studies will not be drastically changed, each

determine redshifts and physical properties, such as metallicity, dust content,
dynamical masses, and star formation history, we performed ultra-deep
spectroscopy with the red-sensitive optical spectrograph FORS2 at the VLT. Our
sample consists of objects, within the CDFS/GOODS area, detected at 4.5 micron,
to be sensitive to stellar mass rather than star formation intensity. The
spectroscopic targets were selected with a photometric redshift constraint
(z>1.4) and magnitude constraints (B(AB)<26, I(AB)<26.5), which should ensure
that these are faint, distant, and fairly massive galaxies. We present the
sample selection, survey design, observations, data reduction, and
spectroscopic redshifts. Up to 30 hours of spectroscopy of 174 spectroscopic
targets and 70 additional objects enabled us to determine 210 redshifts, of
which 145 are at z>1.4. From the redshifts and photometry, we deduce that the
BzK selection criteria are efficient (82%) and suffer low contamination (11%).
Several papers based on the GMASS survey show its value for studies of galaxy
formation and evolution. We publicly release the redshifts and reduced spectra.
In combination with existing and on-going additional observations in
CDFS/GOODS, this data set provides a legacy for future studies of distant
galaxies.

theory of wonderful compactifications of semi-simple linear algebraic groups.
We prove that if $X$ has rational singularities and has a wonderful resolution
of singularities, then $X$ admits a categorical crepant resolution of
singularities. As an immediate corollary, we get that all determinantal
varieties defined by the minors of a generic square/symmetric/skew-symmetric

  We also discuss notions of minimality for a categorical resolution of

such resolutions.

Driven by magnetic pressure gradients, these flows have been less well studied

be as common. Here we present new results exploring the behavior and evolution
of magnetic tower outflows and demonstrate their connection with pulsed power
experimental studies and purely hydrodynamic jets which might represent the
asymptotic propagation regimes of magneto-centrifugally launched jets.
High-resolution AMR MHD simulations (using the AstroBEAR code) provide insights
into the underlying physics of magnetic towers and help us constrain models of
their propagation. Our simulations have been designed to explore the effects of
thermal energy losses and rotation on both tower flows and their hydro
counterparts. We find these parameters have significant effects on the
stability of magnetic towers, but mild effects on the stability of hydro jets.
Current-driven perturbations in the Poynting Flux Dominated (PDF) towers are
shown to be amplified in both the cooling and rotating cases. Our studies of
the long term evolution of the towers show that the formation of weakly
magnetized central jets within the tower are broken up by these instabilities
becoming a series of collimated clumps which magnetization properties vary over
time. In addition to discussing these results in light of laboratory
experiments, we address their relevance to astrophysical observations of young
star jets and outflow from highly evolved solar type stars.

GHz) of CH has been conducted toward Heiles Cloud 2 (HCL2) in the Taurus
molecular cloud complex to reveal its molecular cloud-scale distribution. The
observations were carried out with the Effelsberg 100 m telescope. The CH
emission is found to be extended over the whole region of HCL2. It is brighter
in the southeastern part, which encloses the TMC-1 cyanopolyyne peak than in
the northwestern part. Its distribution extends continuously from the peak of
the neutral carbon emission (CI peak) to the TMC-1 ridge, as if it were
connecting the distributions of the [C I] and C$^{18}$O emissions. Since CH is
an intermediate in gas-phase chemical reactions from C to CO, its emission
should trace the transition region. The above distribution of the CH emission
is consistent with this chemical behavior. Since the CH abundance is subject to
the chemical evolutionary effect, the CH column density in HCL2 no longer
follows a linear correlation wit the H$_2$ column density reported for diffuse
and translucent clouds. More importantly, the CH line profile is found to be
composed of the narrow and broad components. Although the broad component is
dominant around the CI peak, the narrow component appears in the TMC-1 ridge
and dense core regions such as L1527 and TMC-1A. This trend seems to reflect a
narrowing of the line width during the formation of dense cores. These results
suggest that the 3.3 GHz CH line is a useful tool for tracing the chemical and
physical evolution of molecular clouds.

candidate. The object is currently listed by the Minor Planet Center as a
Centaur but it is classified as a Scattered Disk or Trans-Neptunian Object by
others. Now that its arc-length is 8,154 days and has been observed for more
than 20 years, a more robust classification should be possible. Here we explore
the orbital behaviour of this object in order to reveal its current dynamical
status; we perform N-body simulations in both directions of time to investigate
the evolution of its orbital elements. In particular, we study the librational
properties of the mean longitude that currently librates around the value of
the mean longitude of Neptune with an amplitude of nearly 50 degrees and a
period of about 7,500 years. Our calculations show that it has been in its
present dynamical state for about 12,500 years and it will stay there for
another 12,500 years. Therefore, its current state is relatively short-lived.
Due to its chaotic behaviour, the object may have remained in the 1:1 mean
motion resonance with Neptune for several 100,000 years at most, undergoing
transitions between the various resonant states. (309239) 2007 RW10 is
currently a quasi-satellite, the first object of this dynamical class to be
discovered around Neptune. With a diameter of about 250 km, it is the largest
known co-orbital in the Solar System. Its significant eccentricity (0.30) and
orbital inclination (36 degrees), strongly suggest that it did not form in situ
but was captured, likely from beyond Neptune. With an apparent magnitude of
21.1 at opposition (October), it is well suited for spectroscopic observations
that may provide information on its surface composition and hence eventually
its origin.

A
self-adaptive system is seen as composed by two levels: the lower level
describing the actual behaviour of the system and the upper level accounting
for the dynamically changing environmental constraints on the system. In order
to keep our description as general as possible, the lower level is modelled as
a state machine and the upper level as a second-order state machine whose
states have associated formulas over observable variables of the lower level.
Thus, each state of the second-order machine identifies the set of lower-level
states satisfying the constraints. Adaptation is triggered when a second-order
transition is performed; this means that the current system no longer can
satisfy the current high-level constraints and, thus, it has to adapt its
behaviour by reaching a state that meets the new constraints. The semantics of
the multi-level system is given by a flattened transition system that can be
statically checked in order to prove the correctness of the adaptation model.
To this aim we formalize two concepts of weak and strong adaptability providing
both a relational and a logical characterization. We report that this work
gives a formal computational characterization of multi-level self-adaptive
systems, evidencing the important role that (theoretical) computer science
could play in the emerging science of complex systems.

potential there is an additional attractive term that couples these two
together. It is fun to enquire whether the latter could fully counteract the
centrifugal repulsion everywhere making the spacetime completely free of the
centrifugal acceleration. We present here such a curious spacetime metric and
it produces a global monopole like stresses going as $~1/r^2$ in an AdS
spacetime.

problem, which gives an interesting characterization of a prime number $p$ with
respect to the binomial coefficients ${n\choose p}$. We also derive a related
result which generalizes the theorem in one direction.

all inspired from an Olympiad problem. The main goal of the paper is to improve
the main result in Saikia and Vogrinc (2011).
