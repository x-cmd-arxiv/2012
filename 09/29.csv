and discuss these in relation to the acoustic phonon interface scattering in
ceramics. The phonon dispersions show agreement with what is known from neutron
scattering for the optic modes. We find a difference between the generalized
gradient approximation and local density results for the acoustic branches.
This is a consequence of an artificial compression of the van der Waals bonded
gaps in the Bi2Te3 structure when using the generalized gradient approximation.
As a result local density approximation calculations provide a better
description of the phonon dispersions in Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. A key characteristic
of the acoustic dispersions is the existence of a strong anisotropy in the
velocities. We develop a model for interface scattering in ceramics with
acoustic wave anisotropy and apply this to Bi2Te3 and compare with PbTe and
diamond.

letting the intermediate nodes combine the packets they receive. Given a
network, the network coding solvability problem decides whether all the packets
requested by the destinations can be transmitted. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to this problem. We define a closure operator on a digraph closely
related to the network coding instance and we show that the constraints for
network coding can all be expressed according to that closure operator. Thus, a
solution for the network coding problem is equivalent to a so-called solution
of the closure operator. We can then define the closure solvability problem in
general, which surprisingly reduces to finding secret-sharing matroids when the
closure operator is a matroid. Based on this reformulation, we can easily prove
that any multiple unicast where each node receives at least as many arcs as
there are sources is solvable by linear functions. We also give an alternative
proof that any nontrivial multiple unicast with two source-receiver pairs is
always solvable over all sufficiently large alphabets. Based on singular
properties of the closure operator, we are able to generalise the way in which
networks can be split into two distinct parts; we also provide a new way of
identifying and removing useless nodes in a network. We also introduce the
concept of network sharing, where one solvable network can be used to
accommodate another solvable network coding instance. Finally, the guessing
graph approach to network coding solvability is generalised to any closure
operator, which yields bounds on the amount of information that can be
transmitted through a network.

time-scale independent measure of spike train synchrony. This measure is
time-resolved since it relies on instantaneous estimates of spike train
dissimilarity. However, its original definition led to spuriously high
instantaneous values for event-like firing patterns. Here we present a
substantial improvement of this measure which eliminates this shortcoming. The
reliability gained allows us to track changes in instantaneous clustering,
i.e., time-localized patterns of (dis)similarity among multiple spike trains.
Additional new features include selective and triggered temporal averaging as
well as the instantaneous comparison of spike train groups. In a second step, a
causal SPIKE-distance is defined such that the instantaneous values of
dissimilarity rely on past information only so that time-resolved spike train
synchrony can be estimated in real-time. We demonstrate that these methods are
capable of extracting valuable information from field data by monitoring the
synchrony between neuronal spike trains during an epileptic seizure. Finally,
the applicability of both the regular and the real-time SPIKE-distance to
continuous data is illustrated on model electroencephalographic (EEG)
recordings.

Recording in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), we find that response
latency increases with increasing contrast in ON cells for some visual stimuli.
We propose that this surprising latency trend can be explained if ON cells rest
further from threshold at higher contrasts. Indeed, while contrast changes
caused a combination of multiplicative gain change and additive shift in LGN
cells, the additive shift predominated in ON cells. Modeling results supported
this theory: the ON cell latency trend was found when the distance-to-threshold
shifted with contrast, but not when distance-to-threshold was fixed across
contrasts. In the model, latency also increases as surround-to-center ratios
increase, which has been shown to occur at higher contrasts. We propose that
higher-contrast full-field stimuli can evoke more surround inhibition, shifting
the potential further from spiking threshold and thereby increasing response
latency.

operating values of scaled barrier field (f) can be extracted from
Fowler-Nordheim (FN) and Millikan-Lauritsen (ML) plots. By analyzing historical
CFE experiments, which are expected to nearly satisfy the orthodoxy conditions,
""apparently reasonable"" and ""clearly unreasonable"" experimental ranges for f
are found. These provide a test for lack of orthodoxy. For illustration, this
test is applied to 17 post-1975 CFE data sets, mainly for carbon and
semiconductor nanostructures. Some extracted f-value ranges are apparently
reasonable (including many carbon results), some are clearly unreasonable. It
is shown that this test applies to any field-emission diode geometry and any

introduce a modified asymptotic multiple-scale expansion which takes advantage
of the nonlinearly coupled structure of the ionic transport equations. This
allows for a systematic upscaling resulting in a new effective porous medium
formulation which shows a new transport term on the macroscale. Solvability of
all arising equations is rigorously verified. This emergence of a new transport

the LHC would potentially serve as evidence for the direct production of dark
matter. A crucial step toward verifying such evidence is the measurement of the
would-be dark matter mass. If, for example, the invisible particles are found
to have masses consistent with zero, it may prove very challenging to ascertain
whether light dark matter or neutrinos are being observed. We assume that new
invisible particles are pair-produced in a ttbar-like topology and use two
MT2-based methods to measure the masses of the particles associated with the
missing energy. Instead of simulating events and backgrounds, we estimate the
uncertainty associated with measuring the mass of the invisible particle by
assuming a fixed value of the uncertainty associated with the location of the
MT2 endpoint. We find that if this uncertainty associated with measuring the
MT2 endpoints is, quite optimistically, O(1 GeV), the invisible particles must
have masses greater than O(10 GeV) so they can be distinguished from massless
ones at 95% CL. If the results from the CoGeNT, DAMA/LIBRA, and CRESST
experiments have indeed revealed the existence of light dark matter with mass
O(10 GeV), our results suggest that it may be difficult for the LHC to
distinguish dark matter from neutrinos solely via mass measurements.

outflow based on spectro-astrometry of forbidden [SII] emission lines at 6716A
and 6731A observed in UVES/VLT spectra. This adds another object to the handful
of brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (M5-M8) for which an outflow has been
confirmed and which show that the T Tauri phase continues at very low masses.
We find the outflow of ISO143 to be intrinsically asymmetric and the accretion
disk to not obscure the outflow, as only the red outflow component is visible
in the [SII] lines. ISO143 is only the third T Tauri object showing a stronger
red outflow component in spectro-astrometry, after RW Aur (G5) and ISO217
(M6.25). We show here that including ISO143 two out of seven outflows confirmed
in the very low-mass regime (M5-M8) are intrinsically asymmetric. We measure a
spatial extension of the outflow in [SII] of up to 200-300 mas (about 30-50 AU)
and velocities of up to 50-70 km/s. We furthermore detect line emission of
ISO143 in CaII (8498), OI (8446), HeI (7065), and weakly in [FeII] (7155).
Based on a line profile analysis and decomposition we demonstrate that (i) the
CaII emission can be attributed to chromospheric activity, a variable wind, and
the magnetospheric infall zone, (ii) the OI emission mainly to
accretion-related processes but also a wind, and (iii) the HeI emission to
chromospheric or coronal activity. We estimate a mass outflow rate of ISO143 of
~10^{-10} Msol/yr and a mass accretion rate in the range of ~10^{-8} to
~10^{-9} Msol/yer. These values are consistent with those of other brown dwarfs
and very low-mass stars. The derived Mout/Macc ratio of 1-20% is not supporting
previous findings of this number to be very large (>40%) for very low-mass
objects.

dispersions appears to be surprisingly stable with time, regardless of their
star formation history. Furthermore, the overall VDF for star-forming galaxies
is constant with redshift, extending down to the lowest velocity dispersions
probed by this study. The only galaxy population showing strong evolution are
quiescent galaxies with low inferred dispersions, whose number density
increases by a factor of ~4 since z=1.5. This build-up leads to an evolution in
the quiescent fraction of galaxies such that the threshold dispersion above
which quiescent galaxies dominate the counts moves to lower velocity dispersion
with time. We show that our results are qualitatively consistent with a simple
model in which star-forming galaxies quench and are added to the quiescent
population. In order to compensate for the migration into the quiescent
population, the velocity dispersions of star-forming galaxies must increase,
with a rate that increases with dispersion.

use these properties to test asteroseismic scaling relations for the frequency

nonlinear coupled dynamics. As the resonator constitutes an open driven and

matter, providing evidence for dark matter over modified gravity and even
constraints on the dark matter self-interaction cross-section. To properly
constrain the dark matter cross-section it is necessary to understand the
dynamics of the merger, as the inferred cross-section is a function of both the
velocity of the collision and the observed time since collision. While the best
understanding of merging system dynamics comes from N-body simulations, these
are computationally intensive and often explore only a limited volume of the
merger phase space allowed by observed parameter uncertainty. Simple analytic
models exist but the assumptions of these methods invalidate their results near
the collision time, plus error propagation of the highly correlated merger
parameters is unfeasible. To address these weaknesses I develop a Monte Carlo
method to discern the properties of dissociative mergers and propagate the
uncertainty of the measured cluster parameters in an accurate and Bayesian
manner. I introduce this method, verify it against an existing hydrodynamic
N-body simulation, and apply it to two known dissociative mergers: 1ES 0657-558
(Bullet Cluster) and DLSCL J0916.2+2951 (Musket Ball Cluster). I find that this
method surpasses existing analytic models - providing accurate (10% level)
dynamic parameter and uncertainty estimates throughout the merger history. This
coupled with minimal required a priori information (subcluster mass, redshift,
and projected separation) and relatively fast computation (~6 CPU hours) makes
this method ideal for large samples of dissociative merging clusters.

carried out between 9 and 22 years after the initial X-ray discovery, and,
thus, probe the late-time formation of relativistic jets and jet interactions
with the interstellar medium in these systems. We detect a compact radio source
in the nucleus of the galaxy IC 3599 and a compact radio source that is a
possible counterpart to RX J1420.4+5334. We find no radio counterparts for five
other sources with flux density upper limits between 51 and 200 microJy (3
sigma). If the detections truly represent late radio emission associated with a
TDE, then our results suggest that a fraction >~ 10% of X-ray-detected TDEs are
accompanied by relativistic jets. We explore several models for producing late
radio emission, including interaction of the jet with gas in the circumnuclear
environment (blast wave model), and emission from the core of the jet itself.
Upper limits on the radio flux density from archival observations suggest that
the jet formation may have been delayed for years after the TDE, possibly
triggered by the accretion rate dropping below a critical threshold of ~
10^{-2} -- 10^{-3} Mdot_Edd. The non-detections are also consistent with this
scenario; deeper radio observations can determine whether relativistic jets are
present in these systems. The emission from RX J1420.4+5334 is also consistent
with the predictions of the blast wave model, however the radio emission from
IC 3599 is substantially underluminous, and its spectral slope is too flat,

have shown that relativistic jets are ubiquitous when compact objects accrete.
One could therefore anticipate the launch of a jet after a star is disrupted
and accreted by a massive black hole. This birth of a relativistic jet may have
been observed recently in two stellar tidal disruption flares (TDFs), which
were discovered in gamma-rays by Swift. Yet no transient radio emission has
been detected from the tens of TDF candidates that were discovered at optical
to soft X-ray frequencies. Because the sample that was followed-up at radio
frequencies is small, the non-detections can be explained by Doppler boosting,
which reduces the jet flux for off-axis observers. And since the existing
follow-up observation are mostly within ~10 months of the discovery, the
non-detections can also be due to a delay of the radio emission with respect to
the time of disruption. To test the conjecture that all TDFs launch jets, we
obtained 5 GHz follow-up observations with the Jansky VLA of seven known TDFs.
To avoid missing delayed jet emission, our observations probe 1-8 years since
the estimated time of disruption. None of the sources are detected, with very
deep upper limits at the 10 micro Jansky level. These observations rule out the
hypothesis that these TDFs launched jets similar to radio-loud quasars. We also
constrain the possibility that the flares hosted a jet identical to Sw 1644+57,
the first and best-sampled relativistic TDF. We thus obtain evidence for a
dichotomy in the stellar tidal disruption population, implying that the jet
launching mechanism is sensitive to the parameters of the disruption.

found substantial variation among genes in the density of synonymous

rate per nucleotide ({\mu}) among genes. However, the effective population size
(N) is not necessarily constant across the genome. In particular, different
genes may have different histories of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), whereas
Martincorena et al. used a model with random recombination to calculate
{\theta}s. They did filter alignments in an effort to minimize the effects of
HGT, but we doubt that any procedure can completely eliminate HGT among closely
related genomes, such as E. coli living in the complex gut community.
  Here we show that there is no significant variation among genes in rates of
synonymous substitutions in a long-term evolution experiment with E. coli and
that the per-gene rates are not correlated with {\theta}s estimates from genome
comparisons. However, there is a significant association between {\theta}s and
HGT events. Together, these findings imply that {\theta}s variation reflects
different histories of HGT, not local optimization of mutation rates to reduce
the risk of deleterious mutations as proposed by Martincorena et al.

tool. The goal is to reproduce a thematic map that will be compared with a
reference ground truth map (GT), constructed by expecting the region. The HIS
contains more than a hundred bidirectional measures, called bands (or simply
images), of the same region. They are taken at juxtaposed frequencies.
Unfortunately, some bands contain redundant information, others are affected by
the noise, and the high dimensionality of features made the accuracy of
classification lower. The problematic is how to find the good bands to classify
the pixels of regions. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and threshold,
to select relevant bands, without treatment of redundancy. Others control and
eliminate redundancy by selecting the band top ranking the MI, and if its
neighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered
redundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method,
because this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious
information can be discarded. In this paper we'll accept the useful redundancy.
A band contains useful redundancy if it contributes to produce an estimated
reference map that has higher MI with the GT.nTo control redundancy, we
introduce a complementary threshold added to last value of MI. This process is
a Filter strategy; it gets a better performance of classification accuracy and
not expensive, but less preferment than Wrapper strategy.

adsorb both onto neutral and charged surfaces, with the adsorption regulated by
the chain degree of ionization, being larger at lower ionization degrees, where
polyelectrolytes are less charged. Furthermore, polyelectrolyte adsorption is
strongly modulated by the counterions screening of surface charge. These
findings are supported with predictions of adsorption isotherms with varying
ionization degree. We obtain also the surface force mediated by adsorbed
polyelectrolytes, which is calculated for the first time as a function of
ionization degree. The adsorption and surface force isotherms obtained for weak
polyelectrolytes are found to reproduce main trends in experiments, whenever
those results are available, and provide additional insight into the role
played by the competitive adsorption of the counterions and polyelectrolytes on
the surfaces.

measurement precision and stability due to their low quantum projection noise.
However, this potential has so far never been realized because clock stability
has been limited by frequency noise of optical local oscillators. By
synchronously probing two 87Sr lattice systems using a laser with a thermal
noise floor of 1e-15, we remove classically correlated laser noise from the
intercomparison, but this does not demonstrate independent clock performance.
With an improved optical oscillator that has a 1e-16 thermal noise floor, we
demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement over the best reported stability
of any independent clock, achieving a fractional instability of 1e-17 in 1000 s
of averaging time for synchronous or asynchronous comparisons. This result is
within a factor of 2 of the combined quantum projection noise limit for a 160

to their durations (>/< 2 sec). It was generally believed that this reflects a
different physical origin: Collapsars (long) and non-Collapsars (short). We
have recently shown that the duration distribution of Collapsars is flat,
namely independent of the duration, at short durations. Using this model for
the distribution of Collapsars we determine the duration distribution of
non-Collapsars and estimate the probability that a burst with a given duration
(and hardness) is a Collapsar or not. We find that this probability depends
strongly on the spectral window of the observing detector. While the commonly
used limit of 2 sec is conservative and suitable for BATSE bursts, 40% of
swift's bursts shorter than 2 sec are Collapsars and division >/<0.8 sec is
more suitable for swift. We find that the duration overlap of the two
populations is very large. On the one hand there is a non-negligible fraction
of non-Collapsars longer than 10 sec, while on the other hand even bursts
shorter than 0.5 sec in the swift sample have a non-negligible probability to
be Collapsars. Our results enable the construction of non-Collapsar samples
while controlling the Collapsar contamination. They also highlight that no firm
conclusions can be drawn based on a single burst and they have numerous
implications concerning previous studies of non-Collapsar properties that were
based on the current significantly contaminated swift samples of localized
short GRBs. Specifically: (i) all known short bursts with z>1 are most likely
Collapsars, (ii) the only short burst with a clear jet break is most likely a
Collapsar, indicating our lack of knowledge concerning non-Collapsar beaming
(iii) the existence of non-Collapsars with durations up to 10 sec impose new
challenges to non-Collapsar models.

these effects increased the yield strength after isothermal ageing from 217MPa
(0% cold-work) to 287 MPa (5% cold-work). The yield stress increased linearly
with reciprocal interparticle spacing on the basal and prismatic planes and the
alloy showed similar strengthening against basal slip to Mg-Zn. The elongation
increased linearly with particle spacing. The ductility of Mg-Zn-Y alloys was
similar to that of Mg-Zn for equivalently spaced particles.

and in many applications, a non-linear spacing of frequency-bands is
preferable. This paper introduces a framework for efficient implementation of
invertible signal transforms allowing for non-uniform and in particular
non-linear frequency resolution. Non-uniformity in frequency is realized by
applying nonstationary Gabor frames with adaptivity in the frequency domain.
The realization of a perfectly invertible constant-Q transform is described in
detail. To achieve real-time processing, independent of signal length,
slice-wise processing of the full input signal is proposed and referred to as
sliCQ transform.
  By applying frame theory and FFT-based processing, the presented approach
overcomes computational inefficiency and lack of invertibility of classical
constant-Q transform implementations. Numerical simulations evaluate the
efficiency of the proposed algorithm and the method's applicability is
illustrated by experiments on real-life audio signals.

Galactic cosmic rays. The detection of non-thermal emission from SNRs
demonstrates the presence of energetic particles, but direct signatures of
protons and other ions remain elusive. If these particles receive a sizeable
fraction of the explosion energy, the morphological and spectral evolution of
the SNR must be modified. To assess this, we run 3D hydrodynamic simulations of
a remnant coupled with a non-linear acceleration model. We obtain the
time-dependent evolution of the shocked structure, impacted by the
Rayleigh-Taylor hydrodynamic instabilities at the contact discontinuity and by
the back-reaction of particles at the forward shock. We then compute the
progressive temperature equilibration and non-equilibrium ionization state of
the plasma, and its thermal emission in each cell. This allows us to produce
the first realistic synthetic maps of the projected X-ray emission from the
SNR. Plasma conditions (temperature, ionization age) can vary widely over the
projected surface of the SNR, especially between the ejecta and the ambient
medium owing to their different composition. This demonstrates the need for
spatially-resolved spectroscopy. We find that the integrated emission is
reduced with particle back-reaction, with the effect being more significant for
the highest photon energies. Therefore different energy bands, corresponding to
different emitting elements, probe different levels of the impact of particle
acceleration. Our work provides a framework for the interpretation of SNR
observations with current X-ray missions (Chandra, XMM-Newton, Suzaku) and with
upcoming X-ray missions (such as Astro-H).

HD 172555 is a young A7 star belonging to the Beta Pictoris Moving
Group that harbours a debris disc. The Spitzer IRS spectrum of the source
showed mid-IR features such as silicates and glassy silica species, indicating
the presence of a warm dust component with small grains, which places HD 172555
among the small group of debris discs with such properties. The IRS spectrum
also shows a possible emission of SiO gas. Aims. We aim to study the dust
distribution in the circumstellar disc of HD 172555 and to asses the presence
of gas in the debris disc. Methods. As part of the GASPS Open Time Key
Programme, we obtained Herschel-PACS photometric and spectroscopic observations
of the source. We analysed PACS observations of HD 172555 and modelled the
Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) with a modified blackbody and the gas
emission with a two-level population model with no collisional de-excitation.
Results. We report for the first time the detection of OI atomic gas emission
at 63.18 microns in the HD 172555 circumstellar disc. We detect excesses due to
circumstellar dust toward HD 172555 in the three photometric bands of PACS (70,
100, and 160 microns). We derive a large dust particle mass of 4.8e-4 Earth
masses and an atomic oxygen mass of 2.5e-2*R^2 Earth masses, where R in AU is
the separation between the star and the inner disc. Thus, most of the detected
mass of the disc is in the gaseous phase.

Generally, smaller measurement error requires better instrument and higher test
cost. In decision making based on attribute values of objects, we shall select
an attribute subset with appropriate measurement error to minimize the total
test cost. Recently, error-range-based covering rough set with uniform
distribution error was proposed to investigate this issue. However, the
measurement errors satisfy normal distribution instead of uniform distribution
which is rather simple for most applications. In this paper, we introduce
normal distribution measurement errors to covering-based rough set model, and
deal with test-cost-sensitive attribute reduction problem in this new model.
The major contributions of this paper are four-fold. First, we build a new data
model based on normal distribution measurement errors. With the new data model,
the error range is an ellipse in a two-dimension space. Second, the
covering-based rough set with normal distribution measurement errors is
constructed through the ""3-sigma"" rule. Third, the test-cost-sensitive
attribute reduction problem is redefined on this covering-based rough set.
Fourth, a heuristic algorithm is proposed to deal with this problem. The
algorithm is tested on ten UCI (University of California - Irvine) datasets.
The experimental results show that the algorithm is more effective and
efficient than the existing one. This study is a step toward realistic
applications of cost-sensitive learning.

recently is used to construct a theory for the chloride-induced build-up of
metal vacancies at the metal-film interface and the chloride-induced
dissolution of the compact oxide layer. Under the quasi-steady-state
approximation the relevant moving boundary value problem is solved exactly and
analytical expressions are found for the incubation time, oxide dissolution
time, and critical pitting potential, the time evolution of the passive current
density and the metal vacancy concentration and the dependence of these
quantities on the chloride ion concentration. Some diagnostics are also
provided. The replacement of a reaction of the original PDM by another reaction
in the variant is shown to have important consequences for the chloride-ion
effect. While the original PDM invoked the Schottky-pair reaction to couple the
chloride ion to the cation flux and to the metal vacancy generation, the
present model couples the chloride ion directly to the metal vacancy
annihilation without invoking the Schottky-pair reaction. The anion
flux-pinning by chloride is shown to be sufficient to destabilize the oxide
layer. An interesting conclusion of the present work is that thicker oxide
layers are in general more susceptible to pitting due to the chloride ion and
thinner oxide layers destabilize by simple dissolution in the presence of
chloride.

science, particularly algorithmic information & probability theory, and
asymptotically optimal program search (AOPS). To apply AOPS to (possibly
recurrent) neural networks (NNs), I introduce SLIM NNs. Neurons of a typical
SLIM NN have threshold activation functions. During a computational episode,
activations are spreading from input neurons through the SLIM NN until the
computation activates a special halt neuron. Weights of the NN's used
connections define its program. Halting programs form a prefix code. The reset
of the initial NN state does not cost more than the latest program execution.
Since prefixes of SLIM programs influence their suffixes (weight changes
occurring early in an episode influence which weights are considered later),
SLIM NN learning algorithms (LAs) should execute weight changes online during
activation spreading. This can be achieved by applying AOPS to growing SLIM
NNs. To efficiently teach a SLIM NN to solve many tasks, such as correctly
classifying many different patterns, or solving many different robot control
tasks, each connection keeps a list of tasks it is used for. The lists may be
efficiently updated during training. To evaluate the overall effect of
currently tested weight changes, a SLIM NN LA needs to re-test performance only
on the efficiently computable union of tasks potentially affected by the
current weight changes. Future SLIM NNs will be implemented on 3-dimensional
brain-like multi-processor hardware. Their LAs will minimize task-specific
total wire length of used connections, to encourage efficient solutions of
subtasks by subsets of neurons that are physically close. The novel class of
SLIM NN LAs is currently being probed in ongoing experiments to be reported in

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1210.0052",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Hyperspectral image is a substitution of more than a hundred images, called
bands, of the same region. They are taken at juxtaposed frequencies. The
reference image of the region is called Ground Truth map (GT). the problematic
is how to find the good bands to classify the pixels of regions; because the
bands can be not only redundant, but a source of confusion, and decreasing so
the accuracy of classification. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and
threshold, to select relevant bands. Recently there's an algorithm selection
based on mutual information, using bandwidth rejection and a threshold to
control and eliminate redundancy. The band top ranking the MI is selected, and
if its neighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered
redundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method,
because this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious
information can be discarded. In this paper we'll make difference between
useful and useless redundancy. A band contains useful redundancy if it
contributes to decreasing error probability. According to this scheme, we
introduce new algorithm using also mutual information, but it retains only the
bands minimizing the error probability of classification. To control
redundancy, we introduce a complementary threshold. So the good band candidate
must contribute to decrease the last error probability augmented by the
threshold. This process is a wrapper strategy; it gets high performance of
classification accuracy but it is expensive than filter strategy.
