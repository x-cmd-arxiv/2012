focus on the medium-induced radiation of (relatively) soft gluons, which are
abundantly emitted at large angles and thus can transport a small fraction of
the jet energy far away from the jet axis. We perform a complete calculation of
the medium-induced gluon branching in the regime where the gluons that take
part in the branching undergo multiple soft scattering with the medium. We
extend the BDMPSZ theory of radiative energy loss by including the transverse
momentum dependence in the kernel that describes the branching and by analyzing
the correlations between the two offspring gluons. We demonstrate that these
gluons lose color coherence with respect to each other over a time scale that
is comparable to the duration of the branching. It follows that interference
effects between successive emissions are suppressed, a necessary ingredient for
a description of multiple emission of soft gluons by a probabilistic, branching
process.

establishing the dynamical state of galactic nuclei, and the nature of close
stellar interactions with the MBH. The standard description of relaxation as
diffusion provides a perturbative 2nd-order solution in the weak two-body
interaction limit. We run N-body simulations and find that this solution fails
to describe the non-Gaussian relaxation on short timescale, which is strongly
influenced by extreme events even in the weak limit, and is thus difficult to
characterize and measure. We derive a non-perturbative solution for relaxation
as an anomalous diffusion process, and develop a robust estimation technique to
measure it in simulations. These enable us to analyze and model our numerical
results, and validate in detail, for the first time, this model of energy
relaxation around an MBH on all timescales. We derive the relation between the
energy diffusion time, t_E, and the time for a small perturbation to return to
steady state, t_r, in a relaxed, single mass cusp around a MBH. We constrain
the contribution of strong encounters, measure that of the weakest encounters,
determine the value of the Coulomb logarithm, and provide a robust analytical
estimate for t_E in a finite nuclear stellar cusp. We find that t_r ~ 10t_E
~(5/32)Q^2P_h/N_h log Q, where Q=M_bh/M_* is the MBH to star mass ratio, the
orbital period P_h and number of stars N_h are evaluated at the energy scale
corresponding to the MBH's sphere of influence, E_h=sigma_inf^2, where
sigma_inf is the velocity dispersion far from the MBH. We conclude, using the
observed cosmic M_bh/sigma correlation, that cusps around lower-mass MBHs
(M_bh<10^7 Mo), which evolved passively over a Hubble time, should be relaxed.
We consider the effects of anomalous energy diffusion on orbital perturbations
of stars observed near the Galactic MBH.

DLA bias factor to be b_D = (2.17 +/- 0.20) beta_F^{0.22}, where the Lyman
alpha forest redshift distortion parameter beta_F is expected to be above
unity. This bias factor implies a typical host halo mass for DLAs that is much
larger than expected in present DLA models, and is reproduced if the DLA cross
section scales with halo mass as M_h^alpha, with alpha= 1.1 +/- 0.1 for
beta_F=1. Matching the observed DLA bias factor and rate of incidence requires
that atomic gas remains extended in massive halos over larger areas than
predicted in present simulations of galaxy formation, with typical DLA proper
sizes larger than 20 kpc in host halos of masses ~ 10^12 solar masses. We infer
that typical galaxies at z ~ 2 to 3 are surrounded by systems of atomic clouds
that are much more extended than the luminous parts of galaxies and contain ~
10% of the baryons in the host halo.

As a case study, we focus on the accretion flow around the supermassive black
hole in the Galactic Centre, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which has the best
constrained physical parameters. We compare the simulated spectra to the
observational data of Sgr A* and explore the parameter space of our model to
determine the effect of changing the initial magnetic field configuration, ion
to electron temperature ratio T_i/T_e and the target accretion rate. We find
the best description of the data for a mass accretion rate of ~ 1e-9 Msun/yr,
and rapid spin (0.7 < a_* < 0.9). The submillimeter peak flux seems largely
independent of initial conditions, while the higher energies can be very
sensitive to the initial magnetic field configuration. Finally, we also discuss
flaring features observed in some simulations, that may be due to artifacts of
the 2D configuration.

epigenetic chromatin statuses? Furthermore how do cells of different phenotypes
differentiate reproducibly from a single fertilized egg? These fundamental
questions are closely related to a deeply rooted paradigm in developmental
biology that cell differentiation is irreversible. Yet, recently a growing body
of research suggests the possibility of cell reprogramming, which offers the
potential for us to convert one type of cell into another. Despite the
significance of quantitative understandings of cell reprogramming, theoretical
efforts often suffer from the complexity of large circuits maintaining cell
phenotypes coupled at many different epigenetic and gene regulation levels. To
capture the global architecture of cell phenotypes, we propose an ""epigenetic
state network"" approach that translates the classical concept of an epigenetic
landscape into a simple-yet-predictive mathematical model. As a testing case,
we apply the approach to the reprogramming of fibroblasts (FB) to
cardiomyocytes (CM). The epigenetic state network for this case predicts three
major pathways of reprogramming. One pathway goes by way of induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSC) and continues on to the normal pathway of cardiomyocyte
differentiation. The other two pathways involve transdifferentiation (TD)
either indirectly through cardiac progenitor (CP) cells or directly from
fibroblast to cardiomyocyte. Numerous experimental observations support the
predicted states and pathways.

pure Ti down to below 50 mK at the Ti2N point, the Tc then increases rapidly up
to nearly 5 K over a narrow range of nitrogen incorporation. This very sharp
increase of Tc makes it difficult to control the properties of the film from
wafer-to-wafer as well as across a given wafer to within acceptable margins for
device fabrication. Here we show that the nitrogen composition and hence the

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3/IR bands via the J-H colour, is a useful
indicator of the age, metallicity, and dust content of high-redshift stellar
populations. Recent studies have shown that the redward evolution of beta with
cosmic time from redshift 7 to 4 can be largely explained by a build up of
dust. However, initial claims that faint z=7 galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep
Field WFC3/IR imaging (HUDF09) were blue enough to require stellar populations
of zero reddening, low metallicity and young ages, hitherto unseen in
star-forming galaxies, have since been refuted and revised. Here we revisit the
question of how best to measure the UV slope of z=7 galaxies through source
recovery simulations, within the context of present and future ultra-deep
imaging from HST. We consider how source detection, selection and colour
measurement have each biased the measurement of beta in previous studies. After
finding a robust method for measuring beta in the simulations (via a power law
fit to all the available photometry), we remeasure the UV slopes of a sample of
previously published low luminosity z=7 galaxy candidates. The mean UV slope of
faint galaxies in this sample appears consistent with an intrinsic distribution
of normal star-forming galaxies with beta=-2, although properly decoding the
underlying distribution will require further imaging from the ongoing HUDF12
programme. We therefore go on to consider strategies for obtaining better
constraints on the underlying distribution of UV slopes at z=7 from these new
data, which will benefit particularly from the addition of imaging in a second
J-band filter: F140W. We find that a precise and unbiased measurement of beta
should then be possible.

attention to a spectacular train of quasi-periodic knots along the inner 11
arcseconds of the jet, with average separation ~1.1 arcsec (7.6 kpc projected).
We consider two classes of model to explain the periodic knots: those that
involve a static pattern through which the jet plasma travels (e.g. stationary
shocks); and those that involve modulation of the jet engine. Interpreting the
knots as re-confinement shocks implies the jet kinetic power Q ~ 10^{46} erg/s,
but the constant knot separation along the jet is not expected in a realistic
external density profile. For models involving modulation of the jet engine, we
find that the required modulation period is 2 x 10^3 yr < \tau < 3 x 10^5 yr.
The lower end of this range is applicable if the jet remains highly
relativistic on kpc-scales, as implied by the IC/CMB model of jet X-ray
emission. We suggest that the quasi-periodic jet structure in PKS 0637-752 may
be analogous to the quasi-periodic jet modulation seen in the microquasar GRS
1915+105, believed to result from limit cycle behaviour in an unstable
accretion disk. If variations in the accretion rate are driven by a binary
black hole, the predicted orbital radius is 0.7 < a < 30 pc, which corresponds
to a maximum angular separation of ~0.1 - 5 mas.

population. With 360 O-type stars, this is the largest homogeneous sample of
massive stars analyzed to date.
  Methods. We use multi-epoch spectroscopy and variability analysis to identify
spectroscopic binaries. We also use a Monte-Carlo method to correct for
observational biases.
  Results. We observe a spectroscopic binary fraction of 0.35\pm0.03, which
corresponds to the fraction of objects displaying statistically significant
radial velocity variations with an amplitude of at least 20km/s. We compute the
intrinsic binary fraction to be 0.51\pm0.04. We adopt power-laws to describe
the intrinsic period and mass-ratio distributions: f_P ~ (log P)^\pi\ (with
0.15 < log P < 3.5) and f_q ~ q^\kappa\ with 0.1 < q=M_2/M_1 < 1.0. The
power-law indexes that best reproduce the observed quantities are \pi = -0.45
+/- 0.30 and \kappa = -1.0\pm0.4. The obtained period distribution thus favours
shorter period systems compared to an Oepik law. The mass ratio distribution is
slightly skewed towards low mass ratio systems but remains incompatible with a
random sampling of a classical mass function. The binary fraction seems mostly
uniform across the field of view and independent of the spectral types and
luminosity classes. The binary fraction in the outer region of the field of
view (r > 7.8', i.e. approx117 pc) and among the O9.7 I/II objects are however
significantly lower than expected from statistical fluctuations.
  Conclusions. Using simple evolutionary considerations, we estimate that over
50% of the current O star population in 30 Dor will exchange mass with its
companion within a binary system. This shows that binary interaction is greatly
affecting the evolution and fate of massive stars, and must be taken into
account to correctly interpret unresolved populations of massive stars.

  of the Cool Cores","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/sts050",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been proposed that the cool cores of galaxy clusters are stably heated
by cosmic rays (CRs). If this is the case, radio mini-halos, which are often
found in the central regions of cool core clusters, may be attributed to the
synchrotron emission from the CRs. Based on this idea, we investigate the
radial profiles of the mini-halos. First, using numerical simulations, we
confirm that it is appropriate to assume that radiative cooling of the
intracluster medium (ICM) is balanced with the heating by CR streaming. In
these simulations, we assume that the streaming velocity of the CRs is the
sound velocity of the ICM, and indicate that the heating is even more stable
than the case where the streaming velocity is the Alfven velocity. Then,
actually assuming the balance between cooling and heating, we estimate the
radial profiles of CR pressure in six clusters only from X-ray observations.
Since the CR protons interact with the ICM protons, we can predict the radial
profiles of the resultant synchrotron radiation. We compare the predictions
with the observed radial profiles of the mini-halos in the six clusters and
find that they are consistent if the momentum spectra of the CRs are steep.
These results may indicate that the cores are actually being heated by the CRs.
We also predict broad-band spectra of the six clusters, and show that the
non-thermal fluxes from the clusters are small in hard X-ray and gamma-ray
bands.

the most luminous, high-redshift (z=0.81) Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) clusters
discovered in the 268 deg^2 equatorial region survey of the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope. For the weak lensing analysis using i'-band images, we use a
model-fitting (Gauss-Laguerre shapelet) method to measure shapes of galaxy
images, where we fit galaxy images in different exposures simultaneously to
obtain best-fit ellipticities taking into account the different PSFs in each
exposure. We also take into account the astrometric distortion effect on galaxy
images by performing the model fitting in the world coordinate system. To
select background galaxies behind the cluster at z=0.81, we use photometric
redshift (photo-z) estimates for every galaxy derived from the co-added images
of multi-passband Br'i'z'Y, with PSF matching/homogenization. After a photo-z
cut for background galaxy selection, we detect the tangential weak lensing
distortion signal with a total signal-to-noise ratio of about 3.7. By fitting a
Navarro-Frenk-White model to the measured shear profile, we find the cluster
mass to be M_200\bar{\rho}_m = [7.5^+3.2_-2.8(stat.)^+1.3_-0.6(sys.)] x 10^14
M_\odot/h. The weak lensing-derived mass is consistent with previous mass
estimates based on the SZ observation, with assumptions of hydrostatic
equilibrium and virial theorem, as well as with scaling relations between SZ
signal and mass derived from weak lensing, X-ray, and velocity dispersion,
within the measurement errors. We also show that the existence of ACT-CL
J0022.2-0036 at z=0.81 is consistent with the cluster abundance prediction of
the \Lambda-dominated cold dark matter structure formation model. We thus
demonstrate the capability of Subaru-type ground-based images for studying weak
lensing of high-redshift clusters.

of LGRBs' temporal and spectral variables in the largest catalog of Gamma-Ray
Bursts available to date: 2130 BATSE GRBs, while taking into account the
detection threshold and possible selection effects. Constraints on the joint
rest-frame distribution of the isotropic peak luminosity (Liso), total
isotropic emission (Eiso), the time-integrated spectral peak energy (Epkz) and

for a relatively large fraction of LGRBs that have been missed by BATSE
detector with Eiso extending down to ~ 10^49 [erg] and observed spectral peak
energies (Epk) as low as ~ 5 [keV]. LGRBs with rest-frame duration T90z < 1 [s]
or observer-frame duration T90 < 2 [s] appear to be rare events (<0.1% chance
of occurrence). The model predicts a fairly strong but highly significant
correlation (rho=0.58 \pm 0.04) between Eiso & Epkz of LGRBs. Also predicted
are strong correlations of Liso & Eiso with T90z and moderate correlation
between Liso & Epkz. The strength and significance of the correlations found,
encourage the search for underlying mechanisms, though undermine their
capabilities as probes of Dark Energy's equation of state at high redshifts.
The presented analysis favors -- but does not necessitate -- a cosmic rate for
BATSE LGRBs tracing metallicity evolution consistent with a cutoff ~ 0.2-0.5,

dwarf galaxies due to their shorter star formation timescales. Here we use
individual spectroscopic [Fe/H] measurements of stars in 19 Local Group dwarf
galaxies, 13 Galactic open clusters, and 49 globular clusters to show that star
cluster and dwarf galaxy linear metallicity distributions are binomial in form,
with all objects showing strong correlations between their mean linear
metallicity $\bar{Z}$ and intrinsic spread in metallicity $\sigma(Z)^{2}$. A
plot of $\sigma(Z)^{2}$ versus $\bar{Z}$ shows that the correlated
relationships are offset for the dwarf galaxies from the star clusters. The
common binomial nature of these linear metallicity distributions can be
explained with a simple inhomogeneous chemical evolution model (e.g., Oey
2000), where the star cluster and dwarf galaxy behaviour in the
$\sigma(Z)^{2}-\bar{Z}$ diagram is reproduced in terms of the number of
enrichment events, covering fraction, and intrinsic size of the enriched
regions. The inhomogeneity of the self-enrichment sets the slope for the
observed dwarf galaxy $\sigma(Z)^{2}-\bar{Z}$ correlation. The offset of the
star cluster sequence from that of the dwarf galaxies is due to pre-enrichment,
and the slope of the star cluster sequence represents the remnant signature of
the self-enriched history of their host galaxies. The offset can be used to
separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies without a priori knowledge of their
luminosity or dynamical mass. The application of the inhomogeneous model to the
$\sigma(Z)^{2}-\bar{Z}$ relationship provides a numerical formalism to connect
the self-enrichment and pre-enrichment between star clusters and dwarf galaxies
using physically motivated chemical enrichment parameters.

a zonotope $Z(U)$, where $U$ is the set of vectors used to generate the

sum of a general parallelotope and a zonotope $P+Z(U)$ a parallelotope? We give
two necessary conditions and show that the vectors $U$ have to be free. Given a
set $U$ of free vectors, we give several methods for checking if $P + Z(U)$ is
a parallelotope. Using this we classify such zonotopes for some highly

  In the case of the root lattice $\mathsf{E}_6$, it is possible to give a more
geometric description of the admissible sets of vectors $U$. We found that the
set of admissible vectors, called free vectors, is described by the well-known
configuration of $27$ lines in a cubic. Based on a detailed study of the
geometry of $P_V(\mathsf{e}_6)$, we give a simple characterization of the
configurations of vectors $U$ such that $P_V(\mathsf{E}_6) + Z(U)$ is a

multi-wavelength (NIR to X-ray) follow-up observations obtained with the GROND,
BOOTES-3/YA and Stardome optical ground-based telescopes, and the UVOT and the
XRT onboard the Swift satellite. To explain the almost totally decoupled light
curves in the X-ray and optical/NIR domains, a two-component outflow is
proposed. Several models are tested, including continuous energy injection,
components with different electron energy indices and components in two
different stages of spectral evolution. Only the last model can explain both
the decoupled light curves with asynchronous peaks and the peculiar SED
evolution. However, this model has so many unknown free parameters that we are
unable to reliably confirm or disprove its validity, making the afterglow of
GRB 091029 difficult to explain in the framework of the simplest fireball
model.

LABOCA revealed possible counterparts for 2 X-ray absorbed QSOs. The aim here
is to exploit EVLA imaging at 8.4 GHz to establish the QSOs as radio/sub-mm
sources. The challenge in reducing the EVLA data was the presence of a strong
4C source in the field. A new calibration algorithm was applied to the data to
subtract it. The resulting thermal noise limited radio map covers the 16'x16'
Extended WHDF. It contains 41 sources above a 4-sigma limit, 17 of which have
primary beam corrected flux. The radio observations show that the absorbed AGN
with LABOCA detections are coincident with radio sources, confirming the
tendency for X-ray absorbed AGN to be sub-mm bright. These sources show strong
ultraviolet excess (UVX) suggesting the nuclear sightline is gas- but not
dust-absorbed. Of the 3 remaining LABOCA sources within the ~5' half-power beam
width, 1 is identified with a faint nuclear X-ray/radio source in a nearby
galaxy, 1 with a faint radio source and 1 is unidentified in any other band.
  More generally, differential radio source counts are in good agreement with
previous observations, showing at S<50 micro-Jy a significant excess over a
pure AGN model. In the full area, of 10 sources fainter than this limit, 6 have
optical counterparts of which 3 are UVX (i.e. likely QSOs) including the 2
absorbed quasar LABOCA sources. The other faint radio counterparts are not UVX
but are only slightly less blue and likely to be star-forming/merging galaxies,
predominantly at lower luminosities and redshifts. The 4 faint, optically
unidentified radio sources may be either dust obscured QSOs or galaxies. These
high-z obscured AGN and lower-z star-forming populations are thus the main
candidates to explain the observed excess in faint source counts and hence the
excess radio background found previously by the ARCADE2 experiment.

observational quantities in cosmology. All energy releases from resolved and
unresolved extragalactic sources, and the light from any truly diffuse

intensity and spectral energy distribution. It therefore plays a crucial role
in cosmological tests for the formation and evolution of stellar objects and
galaxies, and for setting limits on exotic energy releases in the universe. The
EBL also plays an important role in the propagation of very high energy
gamma-rays which are attenuated en route to Earth by pair producing gamma-gamma
interactions with the EBL and CMB. The EBL affects the spectrum of the sources,
predominantly blazars, in the ~10 GeV to 10 TeV energy regime. Knowledge of the
EBL intensity and spectrum will allow the determination of the intrinsic blazar
spectrum in a crucial energy regime that can be used to test particle
acceleration mechanisms and VHE gamma-ray production models. Conversely,
knowledge of the intrinsic gamma-ray spectrum and the detection of blazars at
increasingly higher redshifts will set strong limits on the EBL and its
evolution. This paper reviews the latest developments in the determination of
the EBL and its impact on the current understanding of the origin and
production mechanisms of gamma-rays in blazars, and on energy releases in the

control diffraction, the study of structured waves has become decisive. Here,
we present a specific class of nondiffracting spatially accelerating solutions
of the Maxwell equations: the Weber waves. These nonparaxial waves propagate
along parabolic trajectories while approximately preserving their shape. They
are expressed in an analytic closed form and naturally separate in forward and
backward propagation. We show that the Weber waves are self-healing, can form
periodic breather waves and have a well-defined conserved quantity: the
parabolic momentum. We find that our Weber waves for moderate to large values
of the parabolic momenta can be described by a modulated Airy function. Because
the Weber waves are exact time-harmonic solutions of the wave equation, they
have implications for many linear wave systems in nature, ranging from
acoustic, electromagnetic and elastic waves to surface waves in fluids and
membranes.

both. In aspherical models, we find spectral and light curve features that vary
systematically with observer orientation. In particular, we find that the early
phase light curves are brighter and bluer when viewed close to the polar axis
but that the peak flux is highest for equatorial (off-axis) inclinations.
Spectral line features also depend systematically on observer orientation,
including the velocity of the SiII 6355A line. Consequently, our models predict
a correlation between line velocity and color that could assist the
identification of supernovae associated with off-axis jet-driven explosions.
The amplitude and range of this correlation depends on the degree of
asphericity, the metallicity and the epoch of observation but we find that it

constraint, that is, a radio only actively transmits signals over a fraction of
the time. For example, it is desirable to have a small duty cycle in some low
power systems; a half-duplex radio cannot keep transmitting if it wishes to
receive useful signals; and a cognitive radio needs to listen and detect
primary users frequently. This work studies the capacity of scalar
discrete-time Gaussian channels subject to duty cycle constraint as well as
average transmit power constraint. An idealized duty cycle constraint is first
studied, which can be regarded as a requirement on the minimum fraction of
nontransmissions or zero symbols in each codeword. A unique discrete input
distribution is shown to achieve the channel capacity. In many situations,
numerically optimized on-off signaling can achieve much higher rate than
Gaussian signaling over a deterministic transmission schedule. This is in part
because the positions of nontransmissions in a codeword can convey information.
Furthermore, a more realistic duty cycle constraint is studied, where the extra
cost of transitions between transmissions and nontransmissions due to pulse
shaping is accounted for. The capacity-achieving input is no longer independent
over time and is hard to compute. A lower bound of the achievable rate as a
function of the input distribution is shown to be maximized by a first-order
Markov input process, the distribution of which is also discrete and can be
computed efficiently. The results in this paper suggest that, under various
duty cycle constraints, departing from the usual paradigm of intermittent
packet transmissions may yield substantial gain.

bulks prepared by systematically varying the sintering conditions under low
pressure. Samples heated at a high temperature of ~900{\deg}C for a long period
showed an increased packing factor, a larger intergrain contact area, and a
significantly enhanced electrical connectivity, all of which indicate
solid-state self-sintering of MgB2. Sintered ex-situ MgB2 bulks from a
laboratory-made ball-milled powder exhibited a greatly enhanced connectivity of
28%, which is the highest connectivity of pressureless ex-situ MgB2 bulks,
wires, and tapes. Surprisingly, grain growth did not occur during long-duration
(~100 h) sintering in the sintered ex-situ MgB2 bulks. This is in marked
contrast to in-situ processed MgB2 samples for which significant grain growth
occurred during heat treatment at ~900{\deg}C, producing grains that are
several tens of times larger than the initial boron grains. Consequently, the
critical current density as a function of the external magnetic field at 20 K
progressively improved with sintering due to the relatively small grain size
and good intergrain connectivity. We thus conclude that solid-state
self-sintering is an effective approach for producing strongly connected, dense
ex-situ MgB2 polycrystals without grain growth.

well as other telescopes. The discovery rate of PTF is about 7000 candidate
transients per year, but currently only about 10% of the candidates are being
followed-up and classified. To overcome this shortcoming, a dedicated
spectrograph, called the SED Machine, is being designed and built at the
California Institute of Technology for the P60 Telescope, aiming to maximize
the classification efficiency of transients discovered by PTF. The SED Machine
is a low resolution (R ~ 100) IFU spectrograph. It consists of a rainbow camera
for spectrophotometric calibration, and a lenslet array plus 3-prism optics
system for integrated field spectra. An overview of the science and design of
the SED Machine is presented here.

Wesenheit function in determining distances to more than 300 Galactic Cepheids,
by taking advantage of the fact that the Wesenheit function is extinction free
by definition. The Wesenheit distances were used to calibrate the projection
factor (p-factor) for Galactic Cepheids that also possess BW distances. Based
on ~70 Cepheids, we found that a period-p factor relation may exhibit a
non-linear trend with a considerable scatter. During our investigation,
discrepant p factors for delta Cephei were found in the literature. This may be
due to inconsistent measurements of the angular diameters using different
empirical techniques. We discuss the reason for the inconsistency of angular
diameter measurements and offer a possible remedy for this problem.

black hole masses to explore the jet formation mechanisms in these sources.
Based on the K\""{o}nigl's inhomogeneous jet model, the jet parameters, such as
the bulk motion Lorentz factor, magnetic field strength, and electron density
in the jet, can be estimated with the very long-baseline interferometry and
X-ray data. We find a significant correlation between black hole mass and the
bulk Lorentz factor of the jet components for this sample, while no significant
correlation is present between the bulk Lorentz factor and the Eddington ratio.
The massive black holes will be spun up through accretion, as the black holes
acquire mass and angular momentum simultaneously through accretion. Recent
investigation indeed suggested that most supermassive black holes in elliptical
galaxies have on average higher spins than the black holes in spiral galaxies,
where random, small accretion episodes (e.g., tidally disrupted stars,
accretion of molecular clouds) might have played a more important role. If this
is true, the correlation between black hole mass and the bulk Lorentz factor of
the jet components found in this work implies that the motion velocity of the
jet components is probably governed by the black hole spin. No correlation is
found between the magnetic field strength at $10R_{\rm S}$ ($R_{\rm S}=2GM/c^2$
is the Schwarzschild radius) in the jets and the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet
components for this sample. This is consistent with the black hole spin
scenario, i.e., the faster moving jets are magnetically accelerated by the
magnetic fields threading the horizon of more rapidly rotating black holes. The
results imply that the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism may dominate over the
Blandford-Payne (BP) mechanism for the jet acceleration at least in these
radio-loud AGNs.

galactic nuclei when the disk accretion rate is below a certain limit (i.e.,
when the ratio of the accretion rate to the Eddingtion accretion rate,
$\dot{m}$, is below about 0.01) but quenched when above. We propose a new
paradigm to explain this observed coupling between the jet and the accretion
disk by investigating the extraction of the rotational energy of a BH when it
is surrounded by different types of accretion disk. At low accretion rates
(e.g., when $\dot{m}\lesssim0.1$), the accretion near the event horizon is
quasi-spherical. The accreting plasmas fall onto the event horizon in a wide
range of latitudes, breaking down the force-free approximation near the
horizon. To incorporate the plasma inertia effect, we consider the
magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) extraction of the rotational energy from BHs by the
accreting MHD fluid, as described by the MHD Penrose process. It is found that
the energy extraction operates, and hence a relativistic jet is launched,
preferentially when the accretion disk consists of an outer Shakura-Sunyaev
disk (SSD) and an inner advection-dominated accretion flow. When the entire
accretion disk type changes into an SSD, the jet is quenched because the
plasmas brings more rest-mass energy than what is extracted from the hole
electromagnetically to stop the extraction. Several other observed BH disk-jet
couplings, such as why the radio luminosity increases with increasing X-ray
luminosity until the radio emission drops, are also explained.

our model predicts the negative effect of an increase in squared return

absorption. In addition, we find a harder spectral component in the first
XMM-Newton spectrum taken at t ~ 7 d. This component is also detected in the
first Swift spectrum of t = 3 - 10 d. While the persistent power-law component
can be explained as inverse Compton emission from radio synchrotron emitting
electrons, the harder component is most likely bremsstrahlung emission from the
shocked stellar wind. Therefore, the harder X-ray emission that fades away
after t ~ 10 d can be interpreted as emission from the shocked circumstellar
wind of SN 2011dh.

Along the diagonal of the Brillouin zone (BZ) we find a plasmon
peak---indicating the presence of metallic states in this momentum

from excitations across the charge-transfer (CT) gap and is the two-particle
manifestation of the small Fermi pocket or arc observed with photoemission in
this part of the BZ. In contrast, the spectrum along the [100]-direction is
almost entirely dominated by CT excitations, reminiscent of the insulating

symmetry, possibly due to fluctuating nematic order in the charge channel. In
addition we find the plasmon bandwidth to be suppressed compared to optimally
doped cuprates.

explosion in the study of this remarkable material. The simple, linear Dirac
cone band structure offers a unique possibility to investigate its finer

been performed on graphene grown on metal substrates but electronic
applications require an insulating substrate. Epitaxial graphene grown by the
thermal decomposition of silicon carbide (SiC) is an ideal candidate for this
due to the large scale, uniform graphene layers produced. The experimental
spectral function of epitaxial graphene on SiC has been extensively studied.
However, until now the cause of an anisotropy in the spectral width of the
Fermi surface has not been determined. In the current work we show, by
comparison of the spectral function to a semi-empirical model, that the
anisotropy is due to small scale rotational disorder ($\sim\pm$ 0.15$^{\circ}$)
of graphene domains in graphene grown on SiC(0001) samples. In addition to the
direct benefit in the understanding of graphene's electronic structure this
work suggests a mechanism to explain similar variations in related ARPES data.

the presence of both mobility and a large number of mobile terminals.In this
thesis, we present a clustering scheme that minimizes message overhead and
congestion for cluster formation and maintenance. The algorithm is devised to
be independent of the MANET Routing algorithm. Depending upon the context, the
clustering algorithm may be implemented in the routing or in higher layers. The
dynamic formation of clusters helps reduce data packet overhead, node
complexity and power consumption, The simulation has been performed in ns-2.

behaviour of the power spectrum of the EoR 21-cm signal in redshift space. We
have considered two models of reionization, one which has homogeneous
recombination (HR) and the other incorporating inhomogeneous recombination
(IR). We have estimated the observable quantities --- quadrupole and monopole
moments of HI power spectrum at redshift space from our simulated data. We find
that the magnitude and nature of the ratio between the quadrupole and monopole
moments of the power spectrum ($P^s_2 /P^s_0$) can be a possible probe for the
epoch of reionization. We observe that this ratio becomes negative at large
scales for $x_{HI} \leq 0.7$ irrespective of the reionization model, which is a
direct signature of an inside-out reionization at large scales. It is possible
to qualitatively interpret the results of the simulations in terms of the
fluctuations in the matter distribution and the fluctuations in the neutral
fraction which have power spectra and cross-correlation $P_{\Delta \Delta}(k)$,
$P_{xx}(k)$ and $P_{\Delta x}(k)$ respectively. We find that at large scales
the fluctuations in matter density and neutral fraction is exactly
anti-correlated through all stages of reionization. This provides a simple
picture where we are able to qualitatively interpret the behaviour of the
redshift space power spectra at large scales with varying $x_{HI}$ entirely in
terms of a just two quantities, namely $x_{HI}$ and the ratio $P_{xx}/P_{\Delta
\Delta}$. The nature of $P_{\Delta x}$ becomes different for HR and IR
scenarios at intermediate and small scales. We further find that it is possible
to distinguish between an inside-out and an outside-in reionization scenario
from the nature of the ratio $P^s_2 /P^s_0$ at intermediate length scales.

still a poorly known object because it is the result of many various
interactions between the surface, the interplanetary medium (Solar wind,
photons and meteoroids), the planetary and the interplanetary magnetic fields.
Many ground-based observations have allowed the detection of intense and
variable sodium emissions at global and local spatial scales, the latter being
mostly concentrated in the polarmid latitude regions. These regions are indeed
the preferred location of solar wind precipitation on the surface of the
planet. In the present paper, by using high resolution Na observations obtained
at the Canary Islands with the THEMIS solar telescope, we analyze the
variability of the sodium exosphere on time-scale of 1 hour and investigate the
possible mechanisms that could explain the exospheric sodium emission
distribution and its dynamics. Our interpretation relates the observed sodium
asymmetries to the combined effects of plasma and photons impacts onto the
Mercury's surface and of sodium diffusion through the upper layer of the
surface. The comparison between data and simulations seems to evidence that,
similarly to what occurs at the Earth, both the magnetic reconnection regimes
of pulsed or quasi-steady reconnection could occur on Mercury, and be
responsible for the observed Na short term variations. In addition to this, a
progressive broadening of the peak regions together with an increase of the
equatorial region seem to corroborate the idea of the role of photon stimulated
desorption, in association with ion sputtering and with global sodium migration
around Mercury as the cause of the observed evolution of the Na exosphere.

recovery is theoretically possible using image smoothing, we add that wavelet
decomposition is an efficient way of recovering 21-cm signal maps to the same
or greater order of accuracy with more flexibility. By comparing the GMCA
output residual maps (equal to the noise, 21-cm signal and any foreground
fitting errors) with the 21-cm maps at one frequency and discarding the smaller

the image and the messages can be estimated simultaneously is desirable. We
propose a spread spectrum watermarking model with image restoration based on
Bayes estimation. We therefore need to assume some prior probabilities. The
probability for estimating the messages is given by the uniform distribution,
and the ones for the image are given by the infinite range model and 2D Ising
model. Any attacks from unauthorized users can be represented by channel
models. We can obtain the estimated messages and image by maximizing the
posterior probability.
  We analyzed the performance of the proposed method by the replica method in
the case of the infinite range model. We first calculated the theoretical
values of the bit error rate from obtained saddle point equations and then
verified them by computer simulations. For this purpose, we assumed that the
image is binary and is generated from a given prior probability. We also assume
that attacks can be represented by the Gaussian channel. The computer
simulation retults agreed with the theoretical values.
  In the case of prior probability given by the 2D Ising model, in which each
pixel is statically connected with four-neighbors, we evaluated the decoding
performance by computer simulations, since the replica theory could not be
applied. Results using the 2D Ising model showed that the proposed method with
image restoration is as effective as the infinite range model for decoding
messages.
  We compared the performances in a case in which the image was blind and one
in which it was informed. The difference between these cases was small as long
as the embedding and attack rates were small. This demonstrates that the
proposed method with simultaneous estimation is effective as a watermarking
decoder.

and transport in tokamak plasmas. The fundamental scale separations present in
plasma turbulence are codified as an asymptotic expansion in the ratio of the
gyroradius to the equilibrium scale length. Proceeding order-by-order in this
expansion, a framework for plasma turbulence is developed. It comprises an
instantaneous equilibrium, the fluctuations driven by gradients in the
equilibrium quantities, and the transport-timescale evolution of mean profiles
of these quantities driven by the fluctuations. The equilibrium distribution
functions are local Maxwellians with each flux surface rotating toroidally as a
rigid body. The magnetic equillibrium is obtained from the Grad-Shafranov
equation for a rotating plasma and the slow (resistive) evolution of the
magnetic field is given by an evolution equation for the safety factor q.
Large-scale deviations of the distribution function from a Maxwellian are given
by neoclassical theory. The fluctuations are determined by the high-flow
gyrokinetic equation, from which we derive the governing principle for
gyrokinetic turbulence in tokamaks: the conservation and local cascade of free
energy. Transport equations for the evolution of the mean density, temperature
and flow velocity profiles are derived. These transport equations show how the
neoclassical corrections and the fluctuations act back upon the mean profiles
through fluxes and heating. The energy and entropy conservation laws for the
mean profiles are derived. Total energy is conserved and there is no net
turbulent heating. Entropy is produced by the action of fluxes flattening
gradients, Ohmic heating, and the equilibration of mean temperatures. Finally,

resistance to spectral hole burning and photodarkening...). Silica glass as a
host material for fibres has proved to be very attractive. However, some
potential applications of RE-doped fibres suffer from limitations in terms of
spectroscopic properties resulting from clustering or inappropriate local
environment when doped into silica. To this aim, we present a new route to
modify some spectroscopic properties of RE ions in silica-based fibres based on
the incorporation of erbium ions in amorphous dielectric nanoparticles, grown
in-situ in fibre preforms. By adding alkaline earth elements, in low
concentration into silica, one can obtain a glass with an immiscibility gap.
Then, phase separation occurs under an appropriate heat treatment. We
investigated the role of three alkaline-earth elements: magnesium, calcium and
strontium. We present the achieved stabilisation of nanometric erbium-doped
dielectric nanoparticles within the core of silica fibres. We present the
nanoparticle dimensional characterisation in fibre samples. We also show the
spectroscopic characterisation of erbium in preform and fibre samples with
different compositions. This new route could have important potentials in
improving RE-doped fibre amplifiers and laser sources.

This leads to a remarkable feature of hadronically quiet di-lepton final states

from flavour-dependent neutrino Yukawa couplings. In this process, one lepton

inevitably drive future broadband mobile communication systems toward achieving
data transmission rates in excess of 100 Mbps. One of the promising
technologies which can satisfy this demand on high data rate mobile
communications services is the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
(OFDM) transmission technology which falls under the general category of
multicarrier modulation systems. OFDM is a spectrally efficient modulation
technique that can achieve high speed data transmission over multipath fading
channels without the need for powerful equalization techniques. However the
price paid for this high spectral efficiency and less intensive equalization is
low power efficiency. OFDM signals are very sensitive to non-linear effects due
to the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), which leads to the power
inefficiency in the RF section of the transmitter. This paper analyzes the
relation between aperiodic autocorrelation of OFDM symbols and PAPR. The paper
also gives a comparative study of PAPR reduction performance of various channel
coding techniques for the OFDM signals. For our study we have considered
Hamming codes, cyclic codes, convolution codes, Golay and Reed-Muller codes.
The results show that each of the channel coding technique has a different PAPR
reduction performance. Coding technique with the highest value of PAPR
reduction has been identified along with an illustration on PAPR reduction
performances with respect to each code.

The CoRoT space mission has been searching for transiting
planets since the end of December 2006. Aims. We aim to investigate the
capability of CoRoT to detect small-size transiting planets in short-period
orbits, and to compare the number of CoRoT planets with 2 \leq R_p \leq 4
Rearth with the occurrence rate of small-size planets provided by the
distribution of Kepler planetary candidates (Howard et al. 2012). Methods. We
performed a test that simulates transits of super-Earths and Neptunes in real
CoRoT light curves and searches for them blindly by using the LAM transit
detection pipeline. Results. The CoRoT detection rate of planets with radius
between 2 and 4 Rearth and orbital period P \leq 20 days is 59% (31%) around
stars brighter than r'=14.0 (15.5). By properly taking the CoRoT detection rate
for Neptune-size planets and the transit probability into account, we found
that according to the Kepler planet occurrence rate, CoRoT should have
discovered 12 \pm 2 Neptunes orbiting G and K dwarfs with P \leq 17 days in six
observational runs. This estimate must be compared with the validated Neptune
CoRoT-24b and five CoRoT planetary candidates in the considered range of
planetary radii. We thus found a disagreement with expectations from Kepler at
3 \sigma or 5 \sigma, assuming a blend fraction of 0% (six Neptunes) and 100%
(one Neptune) for these candidates. Conclusions. This underabundance of CoRoT
Neptunes with respect to Kepler may be due to several reasons. Regardless of
the origin of the disagreement, which needs to be investigated in more detail,
the noticeable deficiency of CoRoT Neptunes at short orbital periods seems to
indirectly support the general trend found in Kepler data, i.e. that the
frequency of small-size planets increases with increasing orbital periods and
decreasing planet radii.

the young luminous Herbig Be star R CrA. Methods: Millimetre wavelength maps of
molecular line and continuum emission towards the low-mass star forming region
IRS7 near R CrA from the SMA and APEX are presented. The maps show the
distribution of 18 lines from 7 species (H2CO, CH3OH, HC3N, c-C3H2, HCN, CN and
SiO) on scales from 3"" to 60"" (400-8000 AU). Using a set of H2CO lines, we
estimate the temperatures and column densities in the region using LTE and
non-LTE methods. The results are compared with 1-D radiative transfer modelling
of the protostellar cores. These models constrain which properties of the
central source, envelope, and environment can give rise to the observed line
and continuum emission. Results: Most of the H2CO emission from the regions
emerges from two elongated narrow ridges dominating the emission picked up in
both interferometric and single-dish measurements. The temperatures inferred
from the H2CO lines are no less than ~30 K and more likely 50-60 K, and the
line emission peaks are offset by ~2500 AU from the location of the embedded
protostars. The temperatures can not be explained by the heating from the young
stellar objects themselves. Irradiation by the nearby Herbig Be star R CrA
could, however, explain the high temperatures. The elevated temperatures can in
turn impact the physical and chemical characteristics of protostars and lead to
enhanced abundances of typical tracers of photon dominated regions seen in
single-dish line surveys of embedded protostars in the region.

analysis, one can find learning tasks where the goal consists of inferring a
ranking of objects, conditioned on a particular target object. We present a
general kernel framework for learning conditional rankings from various types
of relational data, where rankings can be conditioned on unseen data objects.
We propose efficient algorithms for conditional ranking by optimizing squared
regression and ranking loss functions. We show theoretically, that learning
with the ranking loss is likely to generalize better than with the regression
loss. Further, we prove that symmetry or reciprocity properties of relations
can be efficiently enforced in the learned models. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data illustrate that the proposed methods deliver state-of-the-art
performance in terms of predictive power and computational efficiency.
Moreover, we also show empirically that incorporating symmetry or reciprocity
properties can improve the generalization performance.

Gaussian statistics is calculated for the trap model with a Gaussian density of
states. It is argued that for energy-independent variables this function is
reminiscent of the four-time functions that have been discussed earlier in the
interpretation of the results of four-dimensional NMR experiments on
supercooled liquids. Using an approximative relation between the four-time
correlation function and the cubic response function the nonlinear
susceptibility is calculated and the results are compared with the
corresponding ones resulting from an exact calculation. It is found that the
results of the approximation change the qualitative behavior of the modulus of
the susceptibility. Whereas in the exact calculation a peak is found in the
modulus in most cases, depending on temperature and the additional model
parameters no such peak occurs in the approximation. This difference has its
origin mainly in an incorrect estimate of the static response. The results are
discussed in relation to recent experimental findings.

If the constraint-density is less than r^f, then almost every solution has o(n)

  Freezing is a key part of the clustering phenomenon that is hypothesized by
non-rigorous techniques from statistical physics. The understanding of
clustering has led to the development of advanced heuristics such as Survey

algorithmic barrier: that for densities below r^f the random CSPs can be solved
using very simple algorithms, while for densities above r^f one requires more
sophisticated techniques in order to deal with frozen clusters.

to spectropolarimetric observations of the solar internetwork yield
unrealistically large values of the inclination of the magnetic field vector
($\gamma$). This is because photon noise in Stokes $Q$ and $U$ are interpreted
by the inversion code as valid signals, that leads to an overestimation of the
transverse component $B_\perp$, thus the inclination $\gamma$. However, our
study was based on the analysis of linear polarization signals that featured
only uncorrelated noise. In this paper, we develop this idea further and study
this effect in Stokes $Q$ and $U$ profiles that also show correlated noise. In
addition, we extend our study to the three components of the magnetic field
vector, as well as the magnetic filling factor $\alpha$. With this, we confirm
the tendency to overestimate $\gamma$ when inverting linear polarization
profiles that, although non-zero, are still below the noise level. We also
establish that the overestimation occurs mainly for magnetic fields that are
nearly vertical $\gamma \lesssim 20\deg$. This indicates that a reliable
inference of the inclination of the magnetic field vector cannot be achieved by
analyzing only Stokes $I$ and $V$. In addition, when inverting Stokes $Q$ and
$U$ profiles below the noise, the inversion code retrieves a randomly uniform
distribution of the azimuth of the magnetic field vector $\phi$. To avoid these
problems, we propose only inverting Stokes profiles for which the linear
polarization signals are sufficiently above the noise level. However, this
approach is also biased because, in spite of allowing for a very accurate
retrieval of the magnetic field vector from the selected Stokes profiles, it
selects only profiles arising from highly inclined magnetic fields.

heterogeneity index, giving a measure of the likelihood of a node to have a

microHz to 2.21 mHz). The 117 low frequencies cluster in specific frequency
bands, but do not show the equidistant period spacings predicted for gravity
modes of successive radial order, n, and reported for at least one other hybrid
pulsator. The four dominant low frequencies in the 2.8 to 3.0 c/d (32 to 35
microHz) range show strong amplitude variability with timescales of months and
years. These four low frequencies also determine the spacing of the higher
frequencies in and beyond the delta Sct pressure-mode frequency domain. In
fact, most of the higher frequencies belong to one of three families with
spacings linked to a specific dominant low frequency. In the Fourier spectrum,
these family regularities show up as triplets, high-frequency sequences with
absolutely equidistant frequency spacings, side lobes (amplitude modulations)
and other regularities in frequency spacings. Furthermore, within two families
the amplitude variations between the low and high frequencies are related. We
conclude that the low frequencies (gravity modes, rotation) and observed high
frequencies (mostly pressure modes) are physically connected. This unusual
behavior may be related to the very rapid rotation of the star: from a
combination of high and low-resolution spectroscopy we determined that KIC

temperature of 7600 +/- 200 K and a surface gravity log g of 3.9 +/- 0.3.

Kozai cycle in which the eccentricity of the orbit is pumped up to large values
and oscillates with time in antiphase with the inclination. On the other hand,
both the inclination and the eccentricity are damped by the frictional force
that the planet is subject to when it crosses the disc. We show that, by
maintaining either the inclination or the eccentricity at large values, the
Kozai effect provides a way of delaying alignment with the disc and
circularization of the orbit. We find the critical value to be
characteristically as small as about 20 degrees. Typically, Neptune or lower

lifetime, whereas orbits of Jupiter or higher mass planets would align and
circularize. This could play a significant role in planet formation scenarios.

parametric representation of the principal system. The representation is
obtained introducing generalized coherent states for the environment, and is
such that the evolution from a fully quantum environment to a classical one can
be inherently followed. The method is applied to the specific case where the
principal system is a central qubit and the environment is a surrounding ring
of interacting spins, with the overall Hamiltonian being that of the $s=1/2$
Heisenberg star with frustration. In this case the quantum character of the
environment, embodied by the total spin $S$ of the ring, can be physically
varied by acting on the ratio between the couplings entering the Hamiltonian,
and formally followed by increasing $S$. We find that when the star is in any
of its eigenstates, the qubit behaves as if it were under the effect of an
external magnetic field, whose direction in real space is set by the variables
defining the environmental coherent states, and is hence broadened according to
their quantum probability distribution. When the quantum character of the
environment is reduced, such distribution becomes narrower, finally collapsing
into a Dirac-$\delta$ as $S\to\infty$. The entanglement between the central
qubit and its environment remains well defined even in this limit, where it
comes across as the binary entropy of the $2\pi$-normalized Berry phase
characterizing the dynamics of a qubit in an adiabatically precessing magnetic
field.

Arecibo HII Region Discovery Survey (Arecibo HRDS) is a continuation of the
Green Bank Telescope (GBT) HRDS. The targets for the Arecibo HRDS have
spatially coincident 24 micron and 20 cm emission of a similar angular
morphology and extent. To take advantage of Arecibo's sensitivity and small
beam size, sources in this sample are fainter, smaller in angle, or in more
crowded fields compared to those of the GBT HRDS. These Arecibo nebulae are
some of the faintest HII regions ever detected in RRL emission. Our detection
rate is 58%, which is low compared to the 95% detection rate for GBT HRDS
targets. We derive kinematic distances to 23 of the Arecibo HRDS detections.
Four nebulae have negative LSR velocities and are thus unambiguously in the
outer Galaxy. The remaining sources are at the tangent point distance or
farther. We identify a large, diffuse HII region complex that has an associated
HI and 13CO shell. The ~90 pc diameter of the G52L nebula in this complex may
be the largest Galactic HII region known, and yet it has escaped previous
detection.

decades has hardly been studied because, in contrast to many other atmospheric

theoretical considerations, the atmospheric noble gas isotope composition is
assumed to be stable on time scales of up to about 10^6 years, with the
potential exception of anthropogenic changes predicted for the He concentration
and the 3He/4He ratio. However, experimental assessments of the predicted
changes in the atmospheric He isotope composition are controversial. To
empirically test these assumptions and predictions, we analysed the noble gas
isotope composition in samples of the Cape Grim Air Archive, a well-defined
archive of marine boundary layer air in the southern hemisphere. The resulting
time series of the 20Ne, 40Ar, 86Kr and 136Xe concentrations and 20Ne/22Ne and
40Ar/36Ar ratios during 1978-2011 demonstrate the stability of the atmospheric
Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe composition during this time interval. The He isotope data
provide strong evidence for a decrease in the 3He/4He during the same time
interval at a mean rate of 0.23-0.30 permil per year. This result is consistent
with most model predictions of the rate of decrease in the atmospheric 3He/4He
ratio associated with mining and burning of fossil fuels.

the means of testing the modeling of transport processes in stellar interiors.
For some stars, such as solar-like and red giant stars, a rotational splitting
is measured. However, in order to fully exploit these splittings and constrain
the rotation profile, one needs to be able to calculate them accurately. For
some other stars, such as $\delta$ Scuti and Be stars, for instance, the
observed pulsation spectra are modified by rotation to such an extent that a
perturbative treatment of the effects of rotation is no longer valid. We
present here a new two-dimensional non-perturbative code, called ACOR
(\textit{Adiabatic Code of Oscillation including Rotation}) which allows us to
compute adiabatic non-radial pulsations of rotating stars, without making any
assumptions on the sphericity of the star, the fluid properties (i.e.
baroclinicity) or the rotation profile. The 2D non-perturbative calculations
fully take into account the centrifugal distortion of the star and include the
full influence of the Coriolis acceleration. The numerical method is based on a
spectral approach for the angular part of the modes, and a fourth-order finite
differences approach for the radial part. We test and evaluate the accuracy of
the calculations by comparing them with those coming from TOP
(\textit{Two-dimensional Oscillation Program}) for the same polytropic models.
We illustrate the effects of rapid rotation on stellar pulsations through the
phenomenon of avoided crossings. As shown by the comparison with TOP for simple
models, the code is stable, and gives accurate results up to near-critical
rotation rates.

  efficiency is altered by perturbation in proton flow through its hydrophilic

(MF) have lacked a credible mechanism of interaction between MFs and living
material. Objectives: Examine the effect of ELF-MFs on cancer cells. Methods:
Five cancer cell lines were exposed to ELF-MFs within the range of 0.025 to 5
microT, and the cells were examined for karyotype changes after 6 days.
Results: All cancer cells lines lost chromosomes from MF exposure, with a
mostly flat dose-response. Constant MF exposures for three weeks allow a rising
return to the baseline, unperturbed karyotypes. From this point, small MF
increases or decreases are again capable of inducing karyotype contractions.
Our data suggests that the karyotype contractions are caused by MF interference
with mitochondria's ATP synthase (ATPS), compensated by the action of
AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK). The effects of MFs are similar to those of
the ATPS inhibitor oligomycin. They are amplified by metformin, an AMPK
stimulator, and attenuated by resistin, an AMPK inhibitor. Over environmental
MFs, karyotype contractions of various cancer cell lines show exceptionally
wide and flat dose-responses, except for those of erythro-leukemia cells, which
display a progressive rise from 0.025 to 0.4 microT. Conclusions: The
biological effects of MFs are connected to an alteration in the structure of
water that impedes the flux of protons in ATPS channels. These results may be
environmentally important, in view of the central roles played in human
physiology by ATPS and AMPK, particularly in their links to diabetes, cancer
and longevity.

class of iterated skew polynomial rings defined with respect to finite sets of

The important thing in this class is that, if R is a commutative ring, then its
differential simplicity is the necessary and sufficient condition for the
