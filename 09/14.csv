that erode the surfaces of ring particles on time scales of 10^5 - 10^7 years.
The debris ejected from such impacts re-accretes on to the ring, though often
at a slightly different orbital radius from the point of emission. This
`ballistic transport' leads to a rearrangement of the disk's mass and angular
momentum, and gives rise to a linear instability that generates structure on
relatively large scales. It is likely that the 100-km undulations in Saturn's
inner B-ring and the plateaus and 1000-km waves in Saturn's C-ring are
connected to the nonlinear saturation of the instability. In this paper the
physical problem is reformulated so as to apply to a local patch of disk (the
shearing sheet). This new streamlined model helps facilitate our physical
understanding of the instability, and also makes more tractable the analysis of
its nonlinear dynamics. We concentrate on the linear theory in this paper,
showing that the instability is restricted to a preferred range of intermediate
wavenumbers and optical depths. We subsequently apply these general results to
the inner B-ring and the C-ring and find that in both regions the ballistic
transport instability should be near marginality, a fact that may have
important consequences for its prevalence and nonlinear development. Owing to
damping via self-gravity wakes, the instability should not be present in the
A-ring. A following paper will explore the instability's nonlinear saturation
and how it connects to the observed large-scale structure.

radially pulsating stars assume radial symmetry and have the
pulsation-convection interaction included via model equations containing ad hoc
closures and moreover parameters whose values are barely known. We intend to
construct ever more realistic multidimensional models of Cepheids. In the
present paper, the first of a series, we describe the basic numerical approach
and how it is motivated by physical properties of these objects which are
sometimes more, sometimes less obvious. - For the construction of appropriate
models a polar grid co-moving with the mean radial velocity has been introduced
to optimize radial resolution throughout the different pulsation phases. The
grid is radially stretched to account for the change of spatial scales due to
vertical stratification and a new grid refinement scheme is introduced to
resolve the upper, hydrogen ionisation zone where the gradient of temperature
is steepest. We demonstrate that the simulations are not conservative when the
original weighted essentially non-oscillatory method implemented in ANTARES is
used and derive a new scheme which allows a conservative time evolution. The
numerical approximation of diffusion follows the same principles. Moreover, the
radiative transfer solver has been modified to improve the efficiency of
calculations on parallel computers. We show that with these improvements the
ANTARES code can be used for realistic simulations of the convection-pulsation
interaction in Cepheids. We discuss the properties of several models which
include the upper 42% of a Cepheid along its radial coordinate, assume
different opening angles, and are suitable for an in-depth study of convection

Recently, ququats and qutrits defined in four and three dimensional Hilbert
space respectively, have attracted much attention as they offer advantage in
secure quantum communication. However, practical utilization of these
advantages essentially require physical realization of quantum optical ququats
and qutrits. Here, we define four new multi-photonic states (MPS) with $4n +j$

show how the SCS can be used to encode ququat using these MPS as basis vectors

splitter, the resulting states are bipartite four-component entangled coherent
states (BFECS) equivalently representing the entangled ququats. We briefly
discuss the photon statistical properties of such MPS and BFECS. We show that

associated coronal emission is a harbinger of solar maximum. Altrock (Solar
Phys. 216, 343, 2003) showed that the ""Rush"" was well-observed at 1.15 Ro in
the Fe XIV corona at the Sacramento Peak site of the National Solar Observatory
prior to the maxima of Cycles 21 to 23. The data show that solar maximum in
those cycles occurred when the center line of the Rush reached a critical
latitude of 76 +- 2{\deg}. Furthermore, in the previous three cycles solar
maximum occurred when the highest number of Fe XIV emission features per day
(averaged over 365 days and both hemispheres) first reached latitudes 20 +-
1.7{\deg}. Cycle 24 displays an intermittent Rush that is only well-defined in
the northern hemisphere. In 2009 an initial slope of 4.6{\deg}/yr was found in
the north, compared to an average of 9.4 +- 1.7 {\deg}/yr in the previous
cycles. An early fit to the Rush would have reached 76{\deg} at 2014.6.
However, in 2010 the slope increased to 7.5{\deg}/yr (an increase did not occur
in the previous three cycles). Extending that rate to 76 +- 2{\deg} indicates
that the solar maximum in the northern hemisphere already occurred at 2011.6 +-
0.3. In the southern hemisphere the Rush to the Poles, if it exists, is very
poorly defined. A linear fit to several maxima would reach 76{\deg} in the
south at 2014.2. In 1999, persistent Fe XIV coronal emission known as the
""extended solar cycle"" appeared near 70{\deg} in the north and began migrating
towards the equator at a rate 40% slower than the previous two solar cycles.
However, in 2009 and 2010 an acceleration occurred. Currently the greatest
number of emission features is at 21{\deg} in the North and 24{\deg}in the
South. This indicates that solar maximum is occurring now in the North but not
yet in the South.

Moreover, it exhibits a superconducting response on short length and time

the true quantum critical point of this 2D superconductor metal transition is

well does the plasmodium approximate existing motorway networks? We take the

synchronization of fluctuating local populations across vast spatial extent.
Synchronization of abundance has been widely observed across a range of spatial
scales in relation to rate of dispersal among discrete populations. However,
the dependence of synchrony on patterns of among-patch movement across
heterogeneous landscapes has been largely ignored. Here we consider the
duration of movement between two predator-prey communities connected by weak
dispersal, and its effect on population synchrony. More specifically, we
introduce time delayed dispersal to incorporate the finite transmission time
between discrete populations across a continuous landscape. Reducing the system
to a phase model using weakly connected network theory, it is found that the
time delay is an important factor determining the nature and stability of
phase-locked states. Our analysis predicts enhanced convergence to stable
synchronous fluctuations in general, and a decreased ability of systems to
produce in-phase synchronization dynamics in the presence of delayed dispersal.
These results introduce delayed dispersal as a tool for understanding the
importance of dispersal time across a landscape matrix in affecting
metacommunity dynamics. They further highlight the importance of landscape and
dispersal patterns for predicting the onset of synchrony between weakly-coupled
populations.

the voter model, the Bass diffusion model, and threshold models---can be
described in terms of transition rates (spin-flip probabilities) that depend on
the number of nearest neighbors in each of the two possible states.
High-accuracy approximations for the emergent dynamics of such models on
uncorrelated, infinite networks are given by recently-developed compartmental
models or approximate master equations (AME). Pair approximations (PA) and
mean-field theories can be systematically derived from the AME. We show that PA
and AME solutions can coincide under certain circumstances, and numerical
simulations confirm that PA is highly accurate in these cases. For monotone
dynamics (where transitions out of one nodal state are impossible, e.g., SI
disease-spread or Bass diffusion), PA and AME give identical results for the
fraction of nodes in the infected (active) state for all time, provided the
rate of infection depends linearly on the number of infected neighbors. In the
more general non-monotone case, we derive a condition---that proves equivalent
to a detailed balance condition on the dynamics---for PA and AME solutions to
coincide in the limit $t \to \infty$. This permits bifurcation analysis,
yielding explicit expressions for the critical (ferromagnetic/paramagnetic
transition) point of such dynamics, closely analogous to the critical
temperature of the Ising spin model. Finally, the AME for threshold models of
propagation is shown to reduce to just two differential equations, and to give
excellent agreement with numerical simulations. As part of this work,
Octave/Matlab code for implementing and solving the differential equation

and accessible way to study stellar activity. In the Kepler-era, there now
exists precise, continuous photometry of ~150,000 stars presenting an
unprecedented opportunity for statistical analyses of these modulations.
Modelling rotational modulations allows one to invert the observations into
several basic parameters, such as the rotation period, spot coverage, stellar
inclination and differential rotation rate. The most widely used analytic model
for this inversion comes from Budding (1977) and Dorren (1987), who considered
circular, grey starspots for a linearly limb darkened star. In this work, we
extend the model to be more suitable in the analysis of high precision
photometry, such as that by Kepler. Our new freely available Fortran code,
macula, provides several improvements, such as non-linear limb darkening of the
star and spot, a single-domain analytic function, partial derivatives for all
input parameters, temporal partial derivatives, diluted light compensation,
instrumental offset normalisations, differential rotation, starspot evolution
and predictions of transit depth variations due to unocculted spots. Through
numerical testing, we find that the inclusion of non-linear limb darkening
means macula has a maximum photometric error an order-of-magnitude less than
that of Dorren (1987), for Sun-like stars observed in the Kepler-bandpass. The
code executes three orders-of-magnitude faster than comparable numerical codes
making it well-suited for inference problems.

some special modification of the conformal block function, we revisit this

with the stellar continuum peaks. UM 448 exhibits complex emission line

axis that correlates with the continuum morphology of the galaxy. A
spatially-resolved, chemodynamical analysis is presented. Whilst the eastern
tail of UM 448 has electron temperatures (Te) that are typical of BCGs, we find
a region within the main body of the galaxy where the narrow and broad [O III]
4363 line components trace temperatures differing by 5000K and oxygen
abundances differing by 0.4 dex. We measure spatially resolved and integrated
ionic and elemental abundances for O, N, S and Ne throughout UM 448, and find
they do not agree, possibly due the flux-weighting of Te from the integrated

long-slit and integrated spectra of star-forming galaxies in the nearby and
distant universe. A region of enhanced N/O ratio is indeed found, extended over
a ~0.6 kpc^2 region within the main body of the galaxy. Contrary to previous
studies, however, we do not find evidence for a large Wolf-Rayet population,
and conclude that WR stars alone cannot be responsible for producing the
observed N/O excess. Instead, the location and disturbed morphology of the
N-enriched region suggests that interaction-induced inflow of metal-poor gas

instantaneous efficiency of galaxy star formation (i.e., the star formation
rate divided by the baryon accretion rate) from $z=8$ to the present day. This
efficiency exhibits a clear peak near a characteristic halo mass of 10^11.7
Msun, which coincides with longstanding theoretical predictions for the mass
scale relevant to virial shock heating of accreted gas. Above the
characteristic halo mass, the efficiency falls off as the mass to the minus
four-thirds power; below the characteristic mass, the efficiency falls off at
an average scaling of mass to the two-thirds power. By comparison, the shape
and normalization of the efficiency change very little since z=4. We show that
a time-independent star formation efficiency simply explains the shape of the
cosmic star formation rate since z=4 in terms of dark matter accretion rates.
The rise in the cosmic star formation from early times until z=2 is especially
sensitive to galaxy formation efficiency. The mass dependence of the efficiency
strongly limits where most star formation occurs, with the result that
two-thirds of all star formation has occurred inside halos within a factor of
three of the characteristic mass, a range that includes the mass of the Milky

derive stringent upper limits on the dark matter's annihilation cross section.
Even for the very conservative case of a dark matter distribution with a
significant (~kpc) constant-density core, normalized to the minimum density
needed to accommodate rotation curve and microlensing measurements, we find
that the Galactic Center constraint is approximately as stringent as those
derived from dwarf galaxies (which were derived under the assumption of an NFW
distribution). For NFW or Einasto profiles (again, normalized to the minimum
allowed density), the Galactic Center constraints are typically stronger than
those from dwarfs.

reporting a significant decrease in the mean star-formation rates (SFRs) of the
most luminous AGNs (Lx>10^44 erg/s) at z=1-3 in the Chandra Deep Field-North

the number of sources at Lx>10^44 erg/s. On the basis of our analysis, we find
no strong evidence for suppressed star formation in Lx>10^44 erg/s AGNs at
z=1-3. The mean SFRs of the AGNs are constant over the broad X-ray luminosity
range of Lx~10^43-10^45 erg/s (with mean SFRs consistent with typical

accretion of smoothly distributed matter is accounted for, coarse-grained
statistics such as the mass accretion history of halos can be almost
indistinguishable between cold and warm dark matter cases. However, the halo
mass function and progenitor mass functions differ significantly, with the warm
dark matter cases being strongly suppressed below the free-streaming scale of
the dark matter. We demonstrate the importance of using the correct solution

eccentricities 0.2 < e < 0.4), subject to the potential of the SMBH, a stellar
cusp, and the parent gas disc, to study how the orbital elements of the ring
evolve in time. The initial conditions for the stellar ring are drawn from the
results of previous simulations of molecular cloud infall and disruption in the
SMBH potential. While semi-major axes do not evolve significantly, the
distribution of eccentricities spreads out very fast (~1 Myr) as a consequence
of cusp precession. In particular, stellar orbits with initial eccentricity
e>0.3 (e<0.3) tend to become even more (less) eccentric, resulting in a bimodal
eccentricity distribution. The distribution is qualitatively consistent with
that of the massive stars observed in the Galactic Centre's clockwise disc.

ultraviolet completion of the physics that drives electroweak symmetry
breaking. We show that in theories where the operator responsible for the
breaking of conformal symmetry is close to marginal at the breaking scale, the
dilaton mass can naturally lie below the scale of the strong dynamics. However,
in general this condition is not satisfied in the scenarios of interest for
electroweak symmetry breaking, and so the presence of a light dilaton in these
theories is associated with mild tuning. We construct the effective theory of
the light dilaton in this framework, and determine the form of its couplings to
Standard Model states. We show that corrections to the form of the dilaton
interactions arising from conformal symmetry violating effects are suppressed
by the square of the ratio of the dilaton mass to the strong coupling scale,
and are under good theoretical control. These corrections are generally
subleading, except in the case of dilaton couplings to marginal operators, when
symmetry violating effects can sometimes dominate. We investigate the
phenomenological implications of these results for models of technicolor, and
for models of the Higgs as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson, that involve strong
conformal dynamics in the ultraviolet.

two frameworks for testing general relativity in the strong-field regime with
observations of black holes in the electromagnetic spectrum using current or
near-future instruments. In the first part of this thesis, I design tests of
the no-hair theorem, which uniquely characterizes the nature of black holes in
general relativity in terms of their masses and spins and which states that
these compact objects are described by the Kerr metric. I investigate a
quasi-Kerr metric and construct a Kerr-like spacetime, both of which contain an
independent parameter in addition to mass and spin. If the no-hair theorem is
correct, then any deviation from the Kerr metric has to be zero. I show that
already moderate changes of the deviation parameters in either metric lead to
significant modifications of the observed signals. I apply this framework to
the imaging of supermassive black holes using very-long baseline interferometry
as well as to the quasi-periodic variability and relativistically broadened
iron lines observed in both galactic and supermassive black holes. In the

contains a signal from a binary coalescence. Additional information contained
in the electromagnetic signal, such as the sky location or distance to the
source, can help rule out false alarms, and thus lower the necessary threshold
for a detection. Here, we develop a framework for determining how much
sensitivity is added to a gravitational-wave search by triggering on an

electromagnetic transients, from short GRBs to signatures of r-process heating
to optical and radio orphan afterglows. We compute the expected rates of
multi-messenger observations in the Advanced detector era, and find that
searches triggered on short GRBs --- with current high-energy instruments, such
as Fermi --- and nucleosynthetic `kilonovae' --- with future optical surveys,
like LSST --- can boost the number of multi-messenger detections by 15% and
40%, respectively, for a binary neutron star progenitor model. Short GRB
triggers offer precise merger timing, but suffer from detection rates decreased
by beaming and the high a priori probability that the source is outside the
LIGO-Virgo sensitive volume. Isotropic kilonovae, on the other hand, could be
commonly observed within the LIGO-Virgo sensitive volume with an instrument
roughly an order of magnitude more sensitive than current optical surveys. We
propose that the most productive strategy for making multi-messenger

long been a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such
analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population allele
frequencies and neutral correlations of allele frequencies among populations
due to shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of
methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns, and
correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while
accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously
implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of
`standardized allele frequencies' that allows investigators to apply tests of
their choice to multiple populations, while accounting for sampling and
covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that
these standardized frequencies can be used to calculate powerful tests to
detect non-parametric correlations with environmental variables, which are also
less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate
how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to
detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test
is conceptually related to FST but should be more powerful as we account for
population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of
population pools, which is a cost-efficient way to estimate population allele
frequencies, but it implies an additional level of sampling noise. The utility
of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by re-analyzing human SNP
data from the HGDP populations. An implementation of our method will be

stabilizes dark matter in a beautiful way. If dark matter has a non-real
intrinsic parity \pm i (e.g. Majorana fermions), parity can ensure that it
cannot decay to all normal particles with real intrinsic parities. However if
Majorana couplings are absent either in the Lepton or the dark sector, P
symmetry can be redefined to remove relative non-real intrinsic phases. It is
therefore predicted that neutrinos and dark matter fermions must have Majorana
masses if dark matter is stable due to parity. We also consider vectorlike
doublet fermions with intrinsic parity \pm i. Strong CP problem is solved by
additionally imposing CP. Leptonic CP phases vanish at the tree level in the
minimal strong CP solving model, which is a testable prediction. Experimentally
if leptonic CP phases are not found (they are found to be consistent with 0 or
\pi) it can be evidence for the type of models in this work where CP is
spontaneously or softly broken and there is also a second hidden or softly
broken symmetry such as P, Z_2 or Z_4. However leptonic CP violation can be
present in closely related or some non-minimal versions of these models.

a difference in the nuclear spin excitation temperatures of the two species.
This discrepancy comes as a surprise, as H3+ and H2 should undergo frequent
thermalizing collisions in molecular clouds. Non-thermal behavior of the
fundamental H3+ / H2 collision system at low temperatures was considered as a
possible cause for the observed irregular populations. Here, we present
measurements of the steady-state ortho/para ratio of H3+ in collisions with H2
molecules in a temperature-variable radiofrequency ion trap between 45-100 K.
The experimental results are close to the expected thermal outcome and they
agree very well with a previous micro-canonical model. We briefly discuss the
implications of the experimental results for the chemistry of the diffuse

we introduce a large deviations method, valid nominally for a large number M of

channel MIMO Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers,
with arbitrary transmission power profiles and in the presence of receiver
antenna correlations. This approach extends the Gaussian approximation of the
SINR, valid for large M asymptotically close to the center of the distribution,
obtaining the non-Gaussian tails of the distribution. Our methodology allows us
to calculate the SINR distribution to next-to-leading order (O(1/M)) and
showcase the deviations from approximations that have appeared in the
literature (e.g. the Gaussian or the generalized Gamma distribution). We also
analytically evaluate the outage probability, as well as the uncoded
bit-error-rate. We find that our approximation is quite accurate even for the

way? Reliability is of particular interest in neuroscience, where large,
complex networks of excitatory and inhibitory cells are ubiquitous. These
networks are known to autonomously produce strongly chaotic dynamics - an
obvious threat to reliability. Here, we show that such chaos persists in the
presence of weak and strong stimuli, but that even in the presence of chaos,
intermittent periods of highly reliable spiking often coexist with unreliable
activity. We elucidate the local dynamical mechanisms involved in this
intermittent reliability, and investigate the relationship between this
phenomenon and certain time-dependent attractors arising from the dynamics. A
conclusion is that chaotic dynamics do not have to be an obstacle to precise
spike responses, a fact with implications for signal coding in large networks.

D=3+1 dimensions, protected by internal symmetries like time reversal and/or
charge conservation. These phases invoke interactions in a fundamental way but
do not possess topological order and are bosonic analogs of free fermion
topological insulators and superconductors. While a formal cohomology based
classification of such states was recently discovered, their physical
properties remain mysterious. Here we develop a field theoretic description of
several of these states and show that they possess unusual surface states,
which if gapped, must either break the underlying symmetry, or develop
topological order. In the latter case, symmetries are implemented in a way that
is forbidden in a strictly two dimensional theory. While this is the usual fate
of the surface states, exotic gapless states can also be realized. For example,
tuning parameters can naturally lead to a deconfined quantum critical point or,
in other situations, a fully symmetric vortex metal phase. We discuss cases
where the topological phases are characterized by quantized magnetoelectric
response \theta, which, somewhat surprisingly, is an odd multiple of 2\pi. Two
different surface theories are shown to capture these phenomena - the first is
a nonlinear sigma model with a topological term. The second invokes vortices on
the surface that transform under a projective representation of the symmetry
group. A bulk field theory consistent with these properties is identified,
which is a multicomponent `BF' theory supplemented, crucially, with a
topological term. A possible topological phase characterized by the thermal
analog of the magnetoelectric effect is also discussed.

solitons propagating at the interface between metal and linear dielectric.
Nonlocal multipole nonlinearities originating from free conduction electron
plasma of a metal lead to strong interaction between co-propagating surface
plasmon polariton beams at fundamental and second harmonic frequencies. Finite
element numerical modelling for effective two-dimensional medium explicitly
demonstrates the solitons formation, confirming the theoretical results. The
non-diffractive regime of propagation has been demonstrated at silica/silver
interface for 5{\lambda} wide surface plasmon polariton beams with the
loss-limited propagation distance of the order of 100 um for the 750/1550 nm

been shown to be beneficial for nondiffractive surface plasmon polariton
propagation.

inference of plasma equilibria parameters in a Tokamak with the ability to
quantify differences between inferred equilibria and Grad-Shafranov
force-balance solutions. At the heart of this technique is the new method of
observation splitting, which allows multiple forward models to be associated
with a single diagnostic observation. This new idea subsequently provides a
means by which the the space of GS solutions can be efficiently characterised
via a prior distribution. Moreover, by folding force-balance directly into one
set of forward models and utilising simple Biot-Savart responses in another,
the Bayesian inference of the plasma parameters itself produces an evidence (a
normalisation constant of the inferred posterior distribution) which is
sensitive to the relative consistency between both sets of models. This
evidence can then be used to help determine the relative accuracy of the tested
force-balance model across several discharges/times. These ideas have been
implemented in a code called BEAST (Bayesian Equilibrium Analysis and
Simulation Tool), which uses a special implementation of Skilling's nested
sampling algorithm [Skilling, Bayesian Analysis 1(4), 833--859 (2006)] to
perform sampling and evidence calculations on high-dimensional, non-Gaussian

CHD, and CD2 molecules with He atoms occurs at a much slower rate than elastic
scattering over a large range of temperatures (1 uK -- 1 K) and magnetic fields

cooling of ground-state ortho-CH2(X) molecules in a magnetic trap. Furthermore,

that lie in certain subspaces are active or inactive together. The potential
subspaces are known in advance, but the particular set of subspaces that are

that exploiting knowledge of subspaces can further reduce the number of

it only depends on the number of subspaces under consideration, and their
orientation relative to each other. The particulars of the subspaces (e.g.,

investigated. We prove that at steady state, under inversion of velocities, the
condition of time-reversibility over the phase space is equivalent to the
antisymmetry of spatial flux and the symmetry of velocity flux. Then we show
that the condition of time-reversibility alone could not always guarantee the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. Comparing the two conditions together, we found
that the frictional force naturally emerges as the unique odd term of the total
force at thermodynamic equilibrium, and is followed by the Einstein relation.
The two conditions respectively correspond to two previously reported different
entropy production rates. In case that the external force is only
position-dependent, the two entropy production rates become one. We prove that
such an entropy production rate can be decomposed into two nonnegative terms,
expressed respectively by the conditional mean and variance of the
thermodynamic force associated with the irreversible velocity flux at any given
spatial coordinate. In the small inertia limit, the former term becomes the
entropy production rate of the overdamped dynamics; while the anomalous entropy
production rate originated from the latter term. Furthermore, regarding the
connection between the First Law and Second Law, we found that in the steady
state of such a limit, the anomalous entropy production rate is also the
leading order of the Boltzmann-factor weighted difference between the spatial
heat dissipation densities of the underdamped and overdamped dynamics, while
their unweighted difference always tends to vanish.

We use $Ric=0$ to obtain the gravitational vacuum field equation in a
four-dimensional Finsler spacetime. To leading order in the post-Newtonian
approximation, we obtain the explicit form of the Finslerian line element. It
is simply the Schwarzschild's metric except for the Finslerian rescaling
coefficient $f(v)$ of the radial coordinate $r$, i.e. $R=f(v(r))r$. By setting

measured experimentally through actuation of the nanowire at its resonance
frequency, and then relating the resonance frequency to the elastic stiffness
using elementary beam theory. In the present work, we utilize large scale
molecular dynamics simulations to report a novel beat phenomenon in [110]
oriented Ag nanowires. The beat phenomenon is found to arise from the asymmetry
of the lattice spacing in the orthogonal elementary directions of the [110]
nanowire,i.e., [-110] and [001] directions, which results in two different
principal moments of inertia. Because of this, actuations imposed along any
other direction are found to decompose into two orthogonal vibrational
components based on the actuation angle relative to these two elementary
directions, with this phenomenon being generalizable to <110> FCC nanowires of
different materials (Cu, Au, Ni, Pd and Pt).The beat phenomenon is explained
using a discrete moment of inertia model based on the hard sphere assumption,
the model is utilized to show that surface effects enhance the beat phenomenon,
while the effect is reduced with increasing nanowires cross-sectional size or
aspect ratio.Most importantly, due to the existence of the beat phenomena, we
demonstrate that in resonance experiments only a single frequency component is
expected to be observed, particularly when the damping ratio is relatively
large or very small.Furthermore, for a large range of actuation angles, the
lower frequency is more likely to be detected than the higher one,which implies
the experimental predictions of Young's modulus obtained from resonance may in
fact be under predictions. The present study therefore has significant
implications for experimental interpretations of Young's modulus as obtained
via resonance testing.

Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, a fundamental study of the vibrational performance
of the Ag nanowire (NW) is carried out. A comprehensive analysis of the quality
(Q)-factor, natural frequency, beat vibration, as well as high vibration mode
is presented. Two excitation approaches, i.e., velocity excitation and
displacement excitation, have been successfully implemented to achieve the
vibration of NWs. Upon these two kinds of excitations, consistent results are
obtained, i.e., the increase of the initial excitation amplitude will lead to a
decrease to the Q-factor, and moderate plastic deformation could increase the
first natural frequency. Meanwhile, the beat vibration driven by a single
relative large excitation or two uniform excitations in both two lateral
directions is observed. It is concluded that the nonlinear changing trend of
external energy magnitude does not necessary mean a non-constant Q-factor. In
particular, the first order natural frequency of the Ag NW is observed to
decrease with the increase of temperature. Furthermore, comparing with the
predictions by Euler-Bernoulli beam theory, the MD simulation provides a larger
and smaller first vibration frequency for the clamped-clamped and clamped-free
thin Ag NWs, respectively. Additionally, for thin NWs, the first order natural
frequency exhibits a parabolic relationship with the excitation magnitudes. The
frequencies of the higher vibration modes tend to be low in comparison to
Euler-Bernoulli beam theory predictions. A combined initial excitation is
proposed which is capable to drive the NW under a multi-modes vibration and
arrows the coexistence of all the following low vibration modes. This work
sheds lights on the better understanding of the mechanical properties of NWs,
and benefits the increasing utilities of NWs in diverse nano-electronic
devices.

and fabrication process mastering while research efforts from a technological
point of view in terms of endurance and density are very active. NAND flash
memories are becoming the most important storage media in mobile computing and
tend to be less confined to this area. The major constraint of such a
technology is the limited number of possible erase operations per block which
tend to quickly provoke memory wear out. To cope with this issue,
state-of-the-art solutions implement wear leveling policies to level the wear
out of the memory and so increase its lifetime. These policies are integrated
into the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) and greatly contribute in decreasing the
write performance. In this paper, we propose to reduce the flash memory wear
out problem and improve its performance by absorbing the erase operations
throughout a dual cache system replacing FTL wear leveling and garbage
collection services. We justify this idea by proposing a first performance
evaluation of an exclusively cache based system for embedded flash memories.
Unlike wear leveling schemes, the proposed cache solution reduces the total
number of erase operations reported on the media by absorbing them in the cache
for workloads expressing a minimal global sequential rate.

transmission of primary users (PUs) as relays. Our aim is to determine the
cooperation strategies among the primary and secondary systems so as to
maximize the sum-rate of SUs while maintaining quality-of-service (QoS)
requirements of PUs. We formulate a joint optimization problem of PU
transmission mode selection, SU (or relay) selection, subcarrier assignment,
power control, and time allocation. By applying dual method, this mixed integer
programming problem is decomposed into parallel per-subcarrier subproblems,
with each determining the cooperation strategy between one PU and one SU. We
show that, on each leased subcarrier, the optimal strategy is to let a SU
exclusively act as a relay or transmit for itself. This result is fundamentally
different from the conventional spectrum leasing in single-channel systems
where a SU must transmit a fraction of time for itself if it helps the PU's
transmission. We then propose a subgradient-based algorithm to find the
asymptotically optimal solution to the primal problem in polynomial time.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly
enhance the network performance.

states (DOS) calculations. Two peculiar channels of elastic electron
consumption are highlighted, both related to the substrate core level
excitation coupled separately with two particular electron transitions. The
first channel affects the adsorbed layer and enables to reveal the valence
state structure of the adsorbed species as well as the substrate DOS. The
second one includes the multiple plasmon oscillations. The proposed mechanism
of electron transitions assumes that one-dimensional DOS at the vacuum level is
an additional spot for location of excited electrons, along with vacant DOS at
the Fermi level. Observed phenomena are supposed to be a general regularity of
electron-solid interaction and a useful tool for fingerprinting the adsorbed

an entangled coherent state (ECS) from single atom-cavity systems and detecting
whether light is on or off. Unit success with unit fidelity is obtained for
large mean photon number (|{\alpha}|^2). For small |{\alpha}|^2, however, there
is some probability of failure but message state does not destroy, and this
allows us to achieve unit success in a few repeated attempts. Unlike previous
schemes, our scheme also enjoys advantages of deterministic generation of ECS,
robustness of ECS against de-coherence due to photon absorption, and it does
not require many-stage cavity interactions and single photon detection ability.

four years of scientific operation after its launch, foreseen for 2014, it will

keV), this will be about 20 times more sensitive than the ROSAT all sky survey,
while in the hard band (2-10 keV) it will provide the first ever true imaging
survey of the sky at those energies. Such a sensitive all-sky survey will
revolutionize our view of the high-energy sky, and calls for major efforts in
synergic, multi-wavelength wide area surveys in order to fully exploit the
scientific potential of the X-ray data. The design-driving science of eROSITA
is the detection of very large samples (~10^5 objects) of galaxy clusters out
to redshifts z>1, in order to study the large scale structure in the Universe,
test and characterize cosmological models including Dark Energy. eROSITA is
also expected to yield a sample of around 3 millions Active Galactic Nuclei,
including both obscured and un-obscured objects, providing a unique view of the
evolution of supermassive black holes within the emerging cosmic structure. The
survey will also provide new insights into a wide range of astrophysical
phenomena, including accreting binaries, active stars and diffuse emission
within the Galaxy, as well as solar system bodies that emit X-rays via the
charge exchange process. Finally, such a deep imaging survey at high spectral
resolution, with its scanning strategy sensitive to a range of variability
timescales from tens of seconds to years, will undoubtedly open up a vast

is proven for every $p\gg 1/n$. These results show that unlike in the case of

happens around the first moment threshold, for $p = O(\ln n/n)$ it does so
around the median. In particular, in this range the two are far apart from each

going around their host body like a retrograde satellite but their mutual
separation is well beyond the Hill radius and the trajectory is not closed as
they orbit the Sun not the host body. So far, minor bodies temporarily trapped
in the quasi-satellite dynamical state have been identified around Venus,
Earth, the dwarf planet (1) Ceres, the large asteroid (4) Vesta, Jupiter,
Saturn and Neptune. Using computer simulations, Tiscareno and Malhotra have
predicted the existence of a small but significant population of minor bodies
moving in a 1:1 mean motion resonance with Pluto. Here we show using N-body
calculations that the Plutino 15810 (1994 JR1) is currently an accidental
quasi-satellite of Pluto and it will remain as such for nearly 350,000 yr. By
accidental we mean that the quasi-satellite phase is triggered (or terminated)
not by a direct gravitational influence in the form of a discrete close
encounter but as a result of a resonance. The relative mean longitude of the
Plutino circulates with a superimposed libration resulting from the oscillation
of the orbital period induced by the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Neptune.
These quasi-satellite episodes are recurrent with a periodicity of nearly 2
Myr. This makes 15810 the first minor body moving in a 1:1 mean motion
resonance with Pluto. It also makes Pluto the second dwarf planet, besides
Ceres, to host a quasi-satellite. Our finding confirms that the quasi-satellite
resonant phase is not restricted to small bodies orbiting major planets but is
possible for dwarf planets/asteroids too. Moreover, 15810 could be considered
as a possible secondary target for NASA's Pluto-Kuiper Belt Mission New
Horizons after the main Pluto flyby in 2015.

look at a possible generalization to explain the characteristics of the other

stable orbit, the AEI is markedly affected by relativistic effects. We focus on
the characteristics of the LFQPO that would result from the relativistic AEI
and compare them with the different LFQPO types. The effects of relativity on

technique that is easily implemented in hardware. Recently, by using a
time-multiplexed architecture, hardware reservoir computers have reached
performance comparable to digital implementations. Operating speeds allowing
for real time information operation have been reached using optoelectronic
systems. At present the main performance bottleneck is the readout layer which
uses slow, digital postprocessing. We have designed an analog readout suitable
for time-multiplexed optoelectronic reservoir computers, capable of working in
real time. The readout has been built and tested experimentally on a standard

ample room for further improvement. The present work thereby overcomes one of
the major limitations for the future development of hardware reservoir

differentiability with respect to moving the atoms, and invariance to the basic

that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach,
in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers
are used to expand the atomic neighbourhood density function. Using the example
system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to
be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbours
increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of
the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether
new approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), that sidesteps
these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two
neighbourhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the
invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations
by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and
the bulk crystal.

The
lensing magnification effect from those under-dense regions is generally
thought to give a small dimming contribution: objects on the far side of a void
are supposed to be observed as slightly smaller than if the void were not
there, which together with conservation of surface brightness implies net
reduction in photons received. This is predicted by the usual weak lensing
integral of the density contrast along the line of sight. We show that this
standard effect is swamped at low redshifts by a relativistic Doppler term that
is typically neglected. Contrary to the usual expectation, objects on the far
side of a void are brighter than they would be otherwise. Thus the local
dynamics of matter in and near the void is crucial and is only captured by the
full relativistic lensing convergence. There are also significant nonlinear
corrections to the relativistic linear theory, which we show actually
under-predicts the effect. We use exact solutions to estimate that these can be
more than 20% for deep voids. This remains an important source of systematic
errors for weak lensing density reconstruction in galaxy surveys and for
supernovae observations, and may be the cause of the reported extra scatter of
field supernovae located on the edge of voids compared to those in clusters.

discontinuity in the xc potential at half filling. However, due to convergence
problems of the Kohn-Sham (KS) self-consistency cycle, the use of these
functionals is mostly restricted to situations where the local density is away
from half filling. Here a numerical scheme for the self-consistent solution of
the lattice KS Hamiltonian with a local xc potential with rapid (or
quasi-discontinuous) density dependence is suggested. The problem is formulated
in terms of finite-temperature DFT where the discontinuity in the xc potential
emerges naturally in the limit of zero temperature. A simple parametrization is
suggested for the xc potential of the uniform 1D Hubbard model at finite
temperature which is obtained from the solution of the thermodynamic Bethe
ansatz. The feasibility of the numerical scheme is demonstrated by application
to a model of fermionic atoms in a harmonic trap. The corresponding density
profile exhibits a plateau of integer occupation at low temperatures which

and their isotopes in the iodine air filters of the type of AU-1500 at the
nuclear power plants are researched. It is shown that the non-homogenous
spatial distribution of absorbed radioactive chemical elements and their
isotopes in the iodine air filter, probed by the gamma-activation analysis
method, is well correlated with the spatial distribution of small disperse coal
dust precipitations in the iodine air filter. This circumstance points out to
an important role by the small disperse coal dust fractions of absorber in the
absorption process of radioactive chemical elements and their isotopes in the
iodine air filter. The physical origins of characteristic interaction between
the radioactive chemical elements and the accumulated small disperse coal dust
precipitations in an iodine air filter are considered. The analysis of
influence by the researched physical processes on the technical characteristics
and functionality of iodine air filters at nuclear power plants is completed.

data for the planet-hosting red dwarf GJ581, which attracted a lot of attention
in recent time. We show that these data contain important correlated noise
component (""red noise"") with the correlation timescale of the order of 10 days.
This red noise imposes a lot of misleading effects while we work in the
traditional white-noise model. To eliminate these misleading effects, we
propose a maximum-likelihood algorithm equipped by an extended model of the
noise structure. We treat the red noise as a Gaussian random process with
exponentially decaying correlation function.
  Using this method we prove that: (i) planets b and c do exist in this system,
since they can be independently detected in the HARPS and Keck data, and
regardless of the assumed noise models; (ii) planet e can also be confirmed
independently by the both datasets, although to reveal it in the Keck data it
is mandatory to take the red noise into account; (iii) the recently announced
putative planets f and g are likely just illusions of the red noise; (iv) the
reality of the planet candidate GJ581 d is questionable, because it cannot be
detected from the Keck data, and its statistical significance in the HARPS data
(as well as in the combined dataset) drops to a marginal level of $\sim
2\sigma$, when the red noise is taken into account.
  Therefore, the current data for GJ581 really support existence of no more
than four (or maybe even only three) orbiting exoplanets. The planet candidate
GJ581 d requests serious observational verification.

density of states reveal that an excess number of long-wavelength
(low-frequency) modes, as compared to the Debye scaling seen in crystalline
materials, is associated with a loss of mechanical rigidity. In this paper, we
present a novel technique for measuring the density of modes (DOM) in a real
granular material, in which we mimic thermal excitations using white noise
acoustic waves. The resulting vibrations are detected with piezoelectric
sensors embedded inside a subset of the particles, from which we are able to
compute the DOM via the spectrum of the velocity autocorrelation function, a
technique previously applied in thermal systems. The velocity distribution for
individual particles is observed to be Gaussian, but the ensemble distribution
is non-Gaussian due to varying widths of the individual distributions. In spite
of this deviation from a true thermal system, we find that the DOM exhibits
several thermal-like features, including Debye scaling in a compressed
hexagonally ordered packing, and an increase in low-frequency modes as the
confining pressure is decreased. In disordered packings, we find that a
characteristic frequency $f_c$ increases with pressure, but more weakly than
has been observed in simulations of frictionless packings.

produce nonanalyticities in the functional dependence of the cumulants of the
renormalized disorder. We show that this leads to a breakdown of the
dimensional reduction predictions if and only if the fractal dimension
characterizing the scaling properties of the avalanches is exactly equal to the
difference between the dimension of space and the scaling dimension of the
primary field, e.g. the magnetization in a random field model. This is proven
by combining scaling theory and functional renormalization group. We therefore
clarify the puzzle of why dimensional reduction remains valid in random field
systems above a nontrivial dimension (but fails below), always applies to the
statistics of branched polymer and is always wrong in elastic models of
interfaces in a random environment.

early-type (elliptical and S0) galaxies. Either secular evolution affects
stellar populations no differently to monolithic collapse or mergers, or
secular evolution is not important in the central regions of these galaxies,
despite the fact that they are barred. (2) The radial metallicity gradients of
boxy/peanut-shaped bulges are uncorrelated with velocity dispersion and are, on
average, shallower than those of unbarred early-type galaxies. This is
qualitatively consistent with chemodynamical models of bar formation, in which
radial inflow and outflow smears out pre-existing gradients.

respectively, the antinodal (AN) and nodal (N) regions corresponding to the
principal axes and the diagonal of the Brillouin zone. The pseudogap appears in
underdoped regime and manifests itself in the B1g spectra by a strong depletion
of the low energy electronic continuum as the temperature decreases. We define
a temperature T* below which the depletion appears and the pseudogap energy,
omegaPG the energy at which the depeletion closes.
  The pseudogap is also present in the B2g spectra but the depletion opens at
higher energy than in the B1g spectra. We observe the creation of new
electronic states inside the depletion as we enter the superconducting phase.
This leads us to conclude (as proposed by S. Sakai et al.) that the pseudogap
has a different structure than the superconducting gap and competes with it. We
show that the nodal quasiparticle dynamic is very robust and almost insensitive
to the pseudogap phase contrary to the antinodal quasiparticle dynamic. We
finally reveal, in contrast to what it is usually admitted,an increase of the
nodal quasiparticle spectral weight with underdoping. We interpret this result

matter is more tightly bound than is a neutron. This energy shift \Delta U
increases the electron energy in \nu_e + n --> p + e, increasing the available
phase space and absorption cross section. Likewise \Delta U decreases the
positron energy in \bar \nu_e + p --> n + e^+, decreasing the phase space and
cross section. We have calculated \Delta U using a model independent virial

significant impact on charged current neutrino interactions in supernovae.
Preliminary simulations of the accretion phase of core-collapse supernovae find
that \Delta U increases \bar \nu_e energies and decreases the \nu_e luminosity.

analytical and numerical studies of spectral stability: (i) the Krein signature
of an eigenvalue, a quantity usually defined in terms of the relative
orientation of certain subspaces that is capable of detecting the structural
instability of imaginary eigenvalues and hence their potential for moving into
the right half-plane leading to dynamical instability under perturbation of the
system, and (ii) the Evans function, an analytic function detecting the
location of eigenvalues. One might expect these two concepts to be related, but
unfortunately examples demonstrate that there is no way in general to deduce
the Krein signature of an eigenvalue from the Evans function.
  The purpose of this paper is to recall and popularize a simple graphical
interpretation of the Krein signature well-known in the spectral theory of
polynomial operator pencils. This interpretation avoids altogether the need to
view the Krein signature in terms of root subspaces and their relation to
indefinite quadratic forms. To demonstrate the utility of this graphical
interpretation of the Krein signature, we use it to define a simple
generalization of the Evans function -- the Evans-Krein function -- that allows
the calculation of Krein signatures in a way that is easy to incorporate into
existing Evans function evaluation codes at virtually no additional
computational cost. The graphical Krein signature also enables us to give
elegant proofs of index theorems for linearized Hamiltonians in the finite
dimensional setting: a general result implying as a corollary the generalized
Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion (or Grillakis-Shatah-Strauss criterion) and a
count of real eigenvalues for linearized Hamiltonian systems in canonical form.
These applications demonstrate how the simple graphical nature of the Krein

our overall understanding of the star formation process. Most clusters disrupt
after they form, thus contributing to the field star population. However, the
most massive and dense clusters remain bound and survive for a Hubble time.
These globular clusters provide unique observational probes of the formation
history of their host galaxies. In particular, the age and metallicity can be
determined for each globular cluster individually, allowing the distribution of
ages and metallicities within host galaxies to be constrained. We show how

their distribution differ from other cancer types. Based on systematic tissue

Hodgkin lymphoma pathology. In this paper, we report results from an image

best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic application of image
analysis to a set of tissue sections of Hodgkin lymphoma. We have implemented
an automatic procedure to handle and explore image data in Aperio's SVS format.
We use pre-processing approaches on a down-scaled image to separate the image
objects from the background. Then, we apply a supervised classification method
to assign pixels to predefined classes. Our pre-processing method is able to
separate the tissue content of images from the image background. We analyzed
three immunohistologically defined groups, non-lymphoma and the two most common
forms of Hodgkin lymphoma, nodular sclerosis and mixed cellularity type. We
found that nodular sclerosis and non-lymphoma images exhibit different amounts
of CD30 stain, whereas mixed cellularity type exhibits a large variance and
overlaps with the other groups. The results can be seen as a first step to
computationally identify tumor regions in the images. This allows us to focus
on these regions when performing computationally expensive tasks like object
detection in the high-resolution image.

matrix sorted in non-increasing order.
  First, we prove the lower bound chi >= 1 + max_m {sum_{i=1}^m mu_i / -
sum_{i=1}^m mu_{n-i+1}} for m=1,...,n-1. This generalizes the Hoffman lower
bound which only involves the maximum and minimum eigenvalues, i.e., the case
$m=1$. We provide several examples for which the new bound exceeds the {\sc
Hoffman} lower bound.
  Second, we conjecture the lower bound chi >= 1 + S^+ / S^-, where S^+ and S^-
are the sums of the squares of positive and negative eigenvalues, respectively.
To corroborate this conjecture, we prove the weaker bound chi >= S^+/S^-. We
show that the conjectured lower bound is tight for several families of graphs.
We also performed various searches for a counter-example, but none was found.
  Our proofs rely on a new technique of converting the adjacency matrix into
the zero matrix by conjugating with unitary matrices and use majorization of
spectra of self-adjoint matrices.
  We also show that the above bounds are actually lower bounds on the
normalized orthogonal rank of a graph, which is always less than or equal to
the chromatic number. The normalized orthogonal rank is the minimum dimension
making it possible to assign vectors with entries of modulus one to the
vertices such that two such vectors are orthogonal if the corresponding
vertices are connected.
  All these bounds are also valid when we replace the adjacency matrix A by W *
A where W is an arbitrary self-adjoint matrix and * denotes the Schur product,
that is, entrywise product of W and A.

negative indirect band gap is observed in Ag(CoP3)4, which indicates
semimetallic behavior, so this compound may possibly exhibit lower thermal

also model the shielding effect of the carbon photoionization continuum as an
attenuation of the incident radiation field shortwards of 1102\AA. Using recent

the understanding of the cross-layer dynamics between MAC and physical layer is
an open problem when the wireless channel exhibits path loss, multi-path
fading, and shadowing. The analysis of MAC and wireless channel interaction is
essential for consistent performance prediction, correct design and
optimization of the protocols. In this paper, a novel approach to analytical

simultaneously a composite channel fading, interference generated by multiple

novel results, we show to what extent the presence of fading may be beneficial

derived for a bound on the mean square angular error of factors along a

decomposition algorithms, prediction of their accuracy, and for checking
stability of a given decomposition of a tensor (condition whether the CRLB is
finite or not). A novel expression is derived for a Hessian matrix needed in
popular damped Gauss-Newton method for solving the CP decomposition of tensors

that the area of competence of the principle itself is that of isolated systems

always possible to isolate any physical system, indeed it leaves it open to the
possibility of the existence of phenomena concerning non isolable physical
systems, e.g. phenomena regulated by some non draggable ether. After the Aspect
experiment realist and local models have been proposed specifically based on
the hypothesis that entangled systems are not isolated. It is hypothesized that
the correlations which allow the violation of Bell's inequality are due to
exchanges of superluminal signals between the various parts of the system and
those signals do not generate causal paradoxes because their propagation is
regulated by a non draggable ether. In the present paper the perfect
compatibility of such models with the relativity theory is strongly advocated.
A criterion is finally proposed to determine the causal ordering between events
since, when there are superluminal signals, that ordering can no longer be

formation and evolution, it is essential that we obtain an accurate assessment
of how and when galaxies assemble their stellar populations, and how this
assembly varies with environment. There is strong observational support for the
hierarchical assembly of galaxies, but our insight into this assembly comes
from sifting through the resolved field populations of the surviving galaxies
we see today, in order to reconstruct their star formation histories, chemical
evolution, and kinematics. To obtain the detailed distribution of stellar ages
and metallicities over the entire life of a galaxy, one needs multi-band
photometry reaching solar-luminosity main sequence stars. The Hubble Space
Telescope can obtain such data in the low-density regions of Local Group
galaxies. To perform these essential studies for a fair sample of the Local
Universe, we will require observational capabilities that allow us to extend
the study of resolved stellar populations to much larger galaxy samples that
span the full range of galaxy morphologies, while also enabling the study of
the more crowded regions of relatively nearby galaxies. With such capabilities
in hand, we will reveal the detailed history of star formation and chemical
evolution in the universe.

a time-dependent background, can be written in the general form, $H + O(H^2)$,
where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. Based on this, a phenomenological dark
energy model whose energy density is of the form $\rho=\alpha H+\beta H^{2}$
was recently proposed to explain the dark energy dominated universe. In this
paper, we investigate this generalized ghost dark energy model in the setup of
Brans-Dicke cosmology. We study the cosmological implications of this model. In
particular, we obtain the equation of state and the deceleration parameters and
a differential equation governing the evolution of this dark energy model. It
is shown that the equation of state parameter of the generalized ghost dark
energy can cross the phantom line ($w_D=-1$) in some range of the parameters
spaces.
