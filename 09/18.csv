dyes, namely, Ir(ppy)3, FIrpic and PQIr, which are commonly used as sensitizers
in organic optoelectronic devices. We show that electronic correlations play a
crucial role in determining the excited-state energies in these systems, due to
localization of electrons on Ir d orbitals. Electronic localization is captured
by employing hybrid functionals within time-dependent density-functional theory
(TDDFT) and with Hubbard-model corrections within the delta-SCF approach. The
performance of both methods are studied comparatively and shown to be in good
agreement with experiment. The Hubbard-corrected functionals provide further
insight into the localization of electrons and on the charge-transfer character
of excited-states. The gained insight allows us to comment on envisioned
functionalization strategies to improve the performance of these systems.
Complementary discussions on the delta-SCF method are also presented in order
to fill some of the gaps in the literature.

data set required to test reaction-rate predictions and to allow an improvement
in the global p+nucleus optical potential required in such calculations. An
in-beam experiment was performed, making it possible to measure in the energy
range between 2.1 and 3.7 MeV, which is for the most part inside the
astrophysically relevant energy window. Angular distributions of the gamma-ray
transitions were measured with high-purity germanium detectors at eight angles
relative to the beam axis. In addition to the total cross sections, partial
cross sections for the direct population of twelve levels were determined. The
resulting cross sections were compared to Hauser-Feshbach calculations using
the code SMARAGD. Only a constant renormalization factor of the calculated
proton widths allowed a good reproduction of both total and partial cross
sections. The accuracy of the calculation made it possible to check the spin
assignment of some states in 75As. In the case of the 1075 keV state, a double
state with spins and parities of 3/2- and 5/2- is needed to explain the
experimental partial cross sections. A change in parity from 5/2+ to 5/2- is

encodes a surprising amount of information about the strong-field dynamics of
merger into frequencies accessible to ground-based interferometers. In this
paper we describe a previously-unknown ""precession"" of the peak emission
direction with time, both before and after the merger, about the total angular
momentum direction. We demonstrate the gravitational wave polarization encodes
the orientation of this direction to the line of sight. We argue the effects of
polarization can be estimated nonparametrically, directly from the
gravitational wave signal as seen along one line of sight, as a slowly-varying
feature on top of a rapidly-varying carrier. After merger, our results can be
interpreted as a coherent excitation of quasinormal modes of different angular
orders, a superposition which naturally ""precesses"" and modulates the
line-of-sight amplitude. Recent analytic calculations have arrived at a similar
geometric interpretation. We suspect the line-of-sight polarization content
will be a convenient observable with which to define new high-precision tests
of general relativity using gravitational waves. Additionally, as the nonlinear
merger process seeds the initial coherent perturbation, we speculate the
amplitude of this effect provides a new probe of the strong-field dynamics
during merger. To demonstrate the ubiquity of the effects we describe, we
summarize the post-merger evolution of 104 generic precessing binary mergers.
Finally, we provide estimates for the detectable impacts of precession on the
waveforms from high-mass sources. These expressions may identify new precessing
binary parameters whose waveforms are dissimilar from the existing sample.

according to pairwise active-time comparison, where each node expects during

restrictive. One aspect of this statement is the fact that natural strata of
local systems, called cohomology support loci, have a rigid structure: they
consist of torsion-translated subtori in a complex torus. We propose and
partially confirm a relation between Bernstein-Sato ideals and local systems.
This relation gives yet a different point of view on the nature of the
structure of cohomology support loci of local systems. The main result is a
partial generalization to the case of a collection of polynomials of the
theorem of Malgrange and Kashiwara which states that the Bernstein-Sato
polynomial of a hypersurface recovers the monodromy eigenvalues of the Milnor
fibers of the hypersurface. We also address a multi-variable version of the
Monodromy Conjecture, prove that it follows from the usual single-variable
Monodromy Conjecture, and prove it in the case of hyperplane arrangements.

problem of designing a multiuser two-way relay system (MU-TWRS) is transceiver
or precoding design to suppress co-channel interference. This paper aims to
study linear precoding designs for a cellular MU-TWRS where a multi-antenna
base station (BS) conducts bi-directional communications with multiple mobile
stations (MSs) via a multi-antenna relay station (RS) with amplify-and-forward
relay strategy. The design goal is to optimize uplink performance, including
total mean-square error (Total-MSE) and sum rate, while maintaining individual
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirement for downlink
signals. We show that the BS precoding design with the RS precoder fixed can be
converted to a standard second order cone programming (SOCP) and the optimal
solution is obtained efficiently. The RS precoding design with the BS precoder
fixed, on the other hand, is non-convex and we present an iterative algorithm
to find a local optimal solution. Then, the joint BS-RS precoding is obtained
by solving the BS precoding and the RS precoding alternately. Comprehensive
simulation is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
precoding designs.

data assumed to be drawn from a continuous, stochastic process. The method
accommodates arbitrary temporal sampling, and takes into account measurement
uncertainties for arbitrary error models (not just Gaussian) on both the time
and signal variables. Any model for the deterministic component of the
variation of the signal with time is supported, as is any model of the
stochastic component on the signal and time variables. Models illustrated here
are constant and sinusoidal models for the signal mean combined with a Gaussian
stochastic component, as well as a purely stochastic model, the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The posterior probability distribution over model
parameters is determined via Monte Carlo sampling. Models are compared using
the ""cross-validation likelihood"", in which the posterior-averaged likelihood
for different partitions of the data are combined. In principle this is more
robust to changes in the prior than is the evidence (the prior-averaged
likelihood). The method is demonstrated by applying it to the light curves of
11 ultra cool dwarf stars, claimed by a previous study to show statistically
significant variability. This is reassessed here by calculating the
cross-validation likelihood for various time series models, including a null
hypothesis of no variability beyond the error bars. 10 of 11 light curves are
confirmed as being significantly variable, and one of these seems to be
periodic, with two plausible periods identified. Another object is best
described by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, a conclusion which is obviously
limited to the set of models actually tested.

derive two master equations describing the propagation of arbitrary linear

Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations. Next, we discuss the general case where
the metric perturbations are coupled to matter fields and derive a new
constrained wave system describing the propagation of three gauge-invariant
scalars from which the complete metric perturbations can be reconstructed. We
apply our formalism to the Einstein-Euler system, dividing the fluid
perturbations into two parts. The first part, which decouples from the metric
perturbations, obeys simple advection equations along the background flow and
describes the propagation of the entropy and the vorticity. The second part
describes a perturbed potential flow, and together with the metric
perturbations it forms a closed wave system.

context of the Semantic Web, especially when automatic tools produce (parts of)
ontologies such as in the field of ontology matching. The best currently known
interactive debugging systems rely upon some meta information in terms of fault
probabilities, which can speed up the debugging procedure in the good case, but
can also have negative impact on the performance in the bad case. The problem
is that assessment of the meta information is only possible a-posteriori.
Consequently, as long as the actual fault is unknown, there is always some risk
of suboptimal interactive diagnoses discrimination. As an alternative, one
might prefer to rely on a tool which pursues a no-risk strategy. In this case,
however, possibly well-chosen meta information cannot be exploited, resulting
again in inefficient debugging actions. In this work we present a reinforcement
learning strategy that continuously adapts its behavior depending on the
performance achieved and minimizes the risk of using low-quality meta
information. Therefore, this method is suitable for application scenarios where
reliable a-priori fault estimates are difficult to obtain. Using problematic
ontologies in the field of ontology matching, we show that the proposed
risk-aware query strategy outperforms both active learning approaches and
no-risk strategies on average in terms of required amount of user interaction.

entropy scaling logarithmically with system size for any set of first- and

verified the presence of g=2 spins on a diamond crystal that was subjected to

eliminated the spin signal without otherwise disrupting the NV center,

scale-invariance of correlation functions of a massless test scalar - which is
the source of the observed cosmological fluctuations - but the explicit

and young population in the SMC. Photometrically estimated metallicities are
used to determine the distances to 1494 RR Lyrae stars, which have typical ages
greater than 9 Gyr. For 2522 Cepheids, with ages of a few tens to a few hundred
Myr, distances are calculated using their period-luminosity relation.
Individual reddening estimates from the intrinsic color of each star are used
to obtain high precision three-dimensional maps. The distances of RR Lyrae
stars and Cepheids are in very good agreement with each other. The median
distance of the RR Lyrae stars is found to be 61.5 +/- 3.4 kpc. For the
Cepheids a median distance of 63.1 +/- 3.0 kpc is obtained. Both populations
show an extended scale height, with 2.0 +/- 0.4 kpc for the RR Lyrae stars and
2.7 +/- 0.3 kpc for the Cepheids. This confirms the large depth of the SMC
suggested by a number of earlier studies. The young population is very
differently oriented than the old stars. While we find an inclination angle of
7{\deg} +/- 15{\deg} and a position angle of 83{\deg} +/- 21{\deg} for the RR
Lyrae stars, for the Cepheids an inclination of 74{\deg} +/- 9{\deg} and a
position angle of 66{\deg} +/- 15{\deg} is obtained. The RR Lyrae stars show a
fairly homogeneous distribution, while the Cepheids follow roughly the
distribution of the bar with their northeastern part being closer to us than
the southwestern part of the bar. Interactions between the SMC, LMC, and Milky
Way are presumably responsible for the tilted, elongated structure of the young
population of the SMC.

identify blazars in large-scale time-domain surveys, in part to aid in the
identification of blazar counterparts to the ~30% of gamma-ray sources in the
Fermi 2FGL catalog still lacking reliable associations. Using data from the
optical LINEAR asteroid survey, we characterize the optical variability of
blazars by fitting a damped random walk model to individual light curves with
two main model parameters, the characteristic timescales of variability (tau),
and driving amplitudes on short timescales (sigma). Imposing cuts on minimum
tau and sigma allows for blazar selection with high efficiency E and
completeness C. To test the efficacy of this approach, we apply this method to
optically variable LINEAR objects that fall within the several-arcminute error
ellipses of gamma-ray sources in the Fermi 2FGL catalog. Despite the extreme
stellar contamination at the shallow depth of the LINEAR survey, we are able to
recover previously-associated optical counterparts to Fermi AGN with E > 88%
and C = 88% in Fermi 95% confidence error ellipses having semimajor axis r <
8'. We find that the suggested radio counterpart to Fermi source 2FGL
J1649.6+5238 has optical variability consistent with other gamma-ray blazars,
and is likely to be the gamma-ray source. Our results suggest that the
variability of the non-thermal jet emission in blazars is stochastic in nature,
with unique variability properties due to the effects of relativistic beaming.
After correcting for beaming, we estimate that the characteristic timescale of
blazar variability is ~3 years in the rest-frame of the jet, in contrast with
the ~320 day disk flux timescale observed in quasars. The variability-based
selection method presented will be useful for blazar identification in
time-domain optical surveys, and is also a probe of jet physics.

the matter and galaxy power spectra in real and redshift space in light of
future observational probes for precision cosmology. Comparing the analytical
results with a large suite of N-body simulations (160 independent boxes of 13.8
(Gpc/h)^3 volume each, which are publicly available), we find that re-summing
terms in the standard perturbative approach predicts the real-space matter
power spectrum with an accuracy of < 2% for k < 0.20 h/Mpc at redshifts z <
1.5. This is obtained following the widespread technique of writing the
resummed propagator in terms of 1-loop contributions. We show that the accuracy
of this scheme increases by considering higher-order terms in the resummed
propagator. By combining resummed perturbation theories with several models for
the mappings from real to redshift space discussed in the literature, the
multipoles of the dark-matter power spectrum can be described with sub-percent
deviations from N-body results for k < 0.15h/Mpc at z < 1. As a consequence,
the logarithmic growth rate, f, can be recovered with sub-percent accuracy on
these scales. Extending the models to massive dark-matter haloes in redshift
space, our results describe the monopole term from N-body data within 2%
accuracy for scales k < 0.15 h/Mpc at z < 0.5; here f can be recovered within <
5% when the halo bias is known. We conclude that these techniques are suitable
to extract cosmological information from future galaxy surveys.

to simultaneously explain both the SED and Subaru H-band polarized light
imaging for the pre-transitional protoplanetary disk PDS 70. Particularly, we
are able to match not only the radial dependence, but also the absolute scale,
of the surface brightness of the scattered light. Our disk model has a cavity
65 AU in radius, which is heavily depleted of sub-micron-sized dust grains, and
a small residual inner disk which produces a weak but still optically thick NIR
excess in the SED. To explain the contrast of the cavity edge in the Subaru
image, a factor of ~1000 depletion for the sub-micron-sized dust inside the
cavity is required. The total dust mass of the disk may be on the order of 1e-4
M_sun, only weakly constrained due to the lack of long wavelength observations
and the uncertainties in the dust model. The scale height of the
sub-micron-sized dust is ~6 AU at the cavity edge, and the cavity wall is
optically thick in the vertical direction at H-band. PDS 70 is not a member of
the class of (pre-)transitional disks identified by Dong et al. (2012), whose
members only show evidence of the cavity in the millimeter-sized dust but not
the sub-micron-sized dust in resolved images. The two classes of
(pre-)transitional disks may form through different mechanisms, or they may
just be at different evolution stages in the disk clearing process.

the M-sigma relation of quiescent galaxies, but the claimed values differ by a
factor of two in recent studies. We investigate the origin of the difference by
measuring the M-sigma relation using an updated galaxy sample from the

methods. We find that the discrepancy is primarily caused by the sample
selection, while the difference stemming from the various regression methods is
marginal. However, we generally prefer the FITEXY and Bayesian estimators based
on Monte Carlo simulations for the M-sigma relation. In addition, the choice of
independent variable in the regression leads to ~0.2 dex variation in the

about the degree to which each newly observed source is astrophysically
relevant source of variable brightness. We provide details about each of the
analysis steps involved, including compilation of the training and testing
sets, construction of descriptive image-based and contextual features, and
optimization of the feature subset and model tuning parameters. Using a
validation set of nearly 30,000 objects from the Palomar Transient Factory, we
demonstrate a missed detection rate of at most 7.7% at our chosen
false-positive rate of 1% for an optimized ML classifier of 23 features,
selected to avoid feature correlation and over-fitting from an initial library
of 42 attributes. Importantly, we show that our classification methodology is
insensitive to mis-labelled training data up to a contamination of nearly 10%,
making it easier to compile sufficient training sets for accurate performance
in future surveys. This ML framework, if so adopted, should enable the
maximization of scientific gain from future synoptic survey and enable fast
follow-up decisions on the vast amounts of streaming data produced by such

to Population III stars. Metal-poor dSph stars also help to reveal the
formation mechanism of the Milky Way halo. We present the detailed abundances
from Keck/HIRES spectroscopy for two very metal-poor stars in two Milky Way
dSphs. One star, in the Sculptor dSph, has [Fe I/H] = -2.40. The other star, in
the Ursa Minor dSph, has [Fe I/H] = -3.16. Both stars fall in the previously
discovered low-metallicity, high-[alpha/Fe] plateau. Most abundance ratios of
very metal-poor stars in these two dSphs are largely consistent with very
metal-poor halo stars. However, the abundances of Na and some r-process
elements lie at the lower end of the envelope defined by inner halo stars of
similar metallicity. We propose that the metallicity dependence of supernova
yields is the cause. The earliest supernovae in low-mass dSphs have less gas to
pollute than the earliest supernovae in massive halo progenitors. As a result,
dSph stars at -3 < [Fe/H] < -2 sample supernovae with [Fe/H] << -3, whereas
halo stars in the same metallicity range sample supernovae with [Fe/H] ~ -3.
Consequently, enhancements in [Na/Fe] and [r/Fe] were deferred to higher
metallicity in dSphs than in the progenitors of the inner halo.

dust components (0.1-micron/2.0-micron glassy olivine and crystalline

glassy olivine is strongly peaked in the disk center and that the 0.1-micron
glassy olivine does not show this concentration, but rather is double peaked,
with the peaks on either side of the star. However, we do not see the strong

Although the spatial distribution of the 0.1-micron dust is consistent with the

58 clusters selected by X-ray flux at 0.1$<$$z$$<$0.3. The survey includes
21,314 unique MMT/Hectospec redshifts for individual galaxies; 10,275 of these
galaxies are cluster members. For each cluster we acquired high signal-to-noise
spectra for $\sim 200$ cluster members and a comparable number of
foreground/background galaxies. The cluster members trace out infall patterns
around the clusters. The members define a very narrow red sequence. The
velocity dispersions decline with radius; we demonstrate that the determination
of the velocity dispersion is insensitive to the inclusion of bluer members (a
small fraction of the cluster population). We apply the caustic technique to
define membership and estimate the mass profiles to large radii. The ultimate
halo mass of clusters (the mass that remains bound in the far future of a
$\Lambda$CDM universe) is on average (1.99$\pm$0.11)$M_{200}$, a new
observational cosmological test in essential agreement with simulations. Summed
profiles binned in $M_{200}$ and in $L_X$ demonstrate that the predicted NFW

clusters (7 < log(age [yrs]) < 10.2) from integrated light spectra and examine
the evolution of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, Upsilon_*. We find that the
clusters deviate from the evolutionary tracks corresponding to simple stellar
populations drawn from standard stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The
nature of this failure, in which Upsilon_* is at first underestimated and then
overestimated with age, invalidates potential simple solutions involving a
rescaling of either the measured masses or modeled luminosities. A range of
possible shortcomings in the straightforward interpretation of the data,
including subtleties arising from cluster dynamical evolution on the present
day stellar mass functions and from stellar binarity on the measured velocity
dispersions, do not materially affect this conclusion given the current
understanding of those effects. Independent of further conjectures regarding
the origin of this problem, this result highlights a basic failing of our
understanding of the integrated stellar populations of these systems. We
propose the existence of two distinct initial mass functions, one primarily,
but not exclusively, valid for older, metal poor clusters and the other for
primarily, but not exclusively, younger, metal rich clusters. The young
(log(age [yrs])< 9.5) clusters are well-described by a bottom-heavy IMF, such
as a Salpeter IMF, while the older clusters are better described by a top-heavy
IMF, such as a light-weighted Kroupa IMF, although neither of these specific
forms is a unique solution. The sample is small, with the findings currently
depending on the results for four key clusters, but doubling the sample is
within reach.

reducing the errors in the inertial motion traces by using the points of
interest in the indoor environment, such as elevators and stairs, for error
resetting. The collected traces are then processed to detect the overall
floorplan shape as well as higher level semantics such as detecting rooms and
corridors shapes along with a variety of points of interest in the environment.
Implementation of the system in two testbeds, using different Android phones,
shows that CrowdInside can detect the points of interest accurately with 0.2%

error resetting technique leads to more than 12 times enhancement in the median
distance error compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, the detailed

the Cassini division) are derived by applying our thermal model to azimuthally
scanned spectra taken by the Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS).
Model fits show the thermal inertia of ring particles to be 16, 13, 20, and 11
Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ for the A, B, and C rings, and the Cassini
division, respectively. However, there are systematic deviations between
modeled and observed temperatures in Saturn's shadow depending on solar phase
angle, and these deviations indicate that the apparent thermal inertia
increases with solar phase angle. This dependence is likely to be explained if
large slowly spinning particles have lower thermal inertia values than those
for small fast spinning particles because the thermal emission of slow rotators
is relatively stronger than that of fast rotators at low phase and vise versa.
Additional parameter fits, which assume that slow and fast rotators have
different thermal inertia values, show the derived thermal inertia values of
slow (fast) rotators to be 8 (77), 8 (27), 9 (34), 5 (55)
Jm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$s$^{-1/2}$ for the A, B, and C rings, and the Cassini
division, respectively. The values for fast rotators are still much smaller
than those for solid ice with no porosity. Thus, fast rotators are likely to
have surface regolith layers, but these may not be as fluffy as those for slow
rotators, probably because the capability of holding regolith particles is
limited for fast rotators due to the strong centrifugal force on surfaces of
fast rotators. Other additional parameter fits, in which radii of fast rotators
are varied, indicate that particles less than $\sim$ 1 cm should not occupy
more than a half of the cross section for the A, B, and C rings.

the size distribution of regolith grains is estimated. We find that good fits
are obtained if the size distribution is broad ranging from 1 $\mu$m to 1-10 cm
with a power law index of $ \sim 3$. This means that the largest regolith
grains are comparable to the smallest free-floating particles in size and that
the power law indices for both free-floating particles and regolith grains are
similar to each other. The apparent relative abundance of small grains
increases with decreasing solar phase angle (or increasing mean temperature).
This trend is particularly strong for the C ring and is probably caused by

certain jump replaced by continuous merger of different states. In addition, we

2667. The main image of the galaxy has magnification factors of 14+/-2.1 in
flux and ~ 2 by 7 in area, yielding an intrinsic spatial resolution of 115-405
pc after AO correction with OSIRIS at KECK II. The HST morphology shows a
clumpy structure and the H\alpha\ kinematics indicates a large velocity
dispersion with V_{max} sin(i)/\sigma ~ 0.73, consistent with high redshift
disk galaxies of similar masses. From the [NII]/H\alpha\ line ratios, we find
that the central 350 parsec of the galaxy is dominated by star formation. The
[NII]/H\alpha\ line ratios are higher in the outer-disk than in the central
regions. Most noticeably, we find a blue-shifted region of strong
[NII]/H\alpha\ emission in the outer disk. Applying our recent HII region and
slow-shock models, we propose that this elevated [NII]/H\alpha\ ratio region is
contaminated by a significant fraction of shock excitation due to galactic
outflows. Our analysis suggests that shocked regions may mimic flat or inverted
metallicity gradients at high redshift.

central theme in systems biology, economics and engineering. In some previous

solving the problem of network reconstruction between measured states. While
recovering the network structure between hidden states is not possible since
they are not measured, in many situations it is important to estimate the
minimal number of hidden states in order to understand the complexity of the
network under investigation and help identify potential targets for
measurements. Estimating the minimal number of hidden states is also crucial to
obtain the simplest state-space model that captures the network structure and
is coherent with the measured data. This paper characterizes minimal order
state-space realizations that are consistent with a given dynamical structure
function by exploring properties of dynamical structure functions and
developing an algorithm to explicitly obtain such a minimal realization.

Below a few keV/c^2, and independent of the mass, a solar axion search would be
sensitive to a coupling g_Ae ~ 10^-12. This limit will set a stringent upper
bound on axion mass for the DFSV and KSVZ models for the mass ranges m_A < 0.1

from an initial naive phenotype to an effector phenotype which controls the

responsible for long-term protection. The expansion and the differentiation
have been considered largely independently. Changes in cell populations are
typically described using ecologically based ordinary differential equation
models. In contrast, differentiation of single cells is studied within systems
biology and is frequently modeled by considering changes in gene and protein
expression in individual cells. Recent advances in experimental systems biology
make available for the first time data to allow the coupling of population and
high dimensional expression data of immune cells during infections. Here we
describe and develop population-expression models which integrate these two
processes into systems biology on the multicellular level. When translated into
mathematical equations, these models result in non-conservative, non-local
advection-diffusion equations. We describe situations where the
population-expression approach can make correct inference from data while
previous modeling approaches based on common simplifying assumptions would
fail. We also explore how model reduction techniques can be used to build
population-expression models, minimizing the complexity of the model while
keeping the essential features of the system. While we consider problems in
immunology in this paper, we expect population-expression models to be more
broadly applicable.

were detected in most phases, corresponding to probe atoms on cubic R- and
non-cubic Pd-sublattices. Site preferences of parent In-probe atoms were
characterized by site-fractions of probes on the R- and Pd-sublattices. For all
Pd-rich samples, probes exclusively occupied the R-sublattice, consistent with
a heuristic rule that solute atoms tend to occupy the sublattice of an element
in which there is a deficiency. For Pd-poorer alloys with R= Tb, Er, Yb, Lu, Y
and Sc, probes exclusively occupied the Pd-sublattice. For Pd-poorer alloys
with R= Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm and Eu, probes occupied both sublattices, with site
fractions varying as a function of temperature. In contrast, probes only
occupied the R-sublattice in Pd-poorer LaPd3. Jump frequencies on the
Pd-sublattice of daughter Cd-probes were determined from nuclear relaxation
caused by fluctuating electric field gradients. Activation enthalpies for
diffusional jumps were determined from temperature dependences and found to
increase linearly as the lattice parameter decreases along the series Pr, Nd,
Eu and Sm. Jump frequencies are believed to have been even higher in CePd3 than
in PrPd3, but were too low to be detectable in Tb, Er, Yb, Lu, Y and Sc

over a prominent range of experimental parameters. While there are empirical
suggestions of particular increasing length scales that accompany such
transitions, this identification is not universal. To better understand such
behavior in quantum systems, we extend a known mapping (earlier studied in
stochastic, or supersymmetric, quantum mechanics) between finite temperature
classical Fokker-Planck systems and related quantum systems at zero temperature
to include general non-equilibrium dynamics. Unlike Feynman mappings or
stochastic quantization methods (or holographic type dualities), the classical
systems that we consider and their quantum duals reside in the same number of
space-time dimensions. The upshot of our exact result is that a Wick rotation
relates (i) dynamics in general finite temperature classical dissipative
systems to (ii) zero temperature dynamics in the corresponding dual many-body
quantum systems. Using this correspondence, we illustrate that, even in the
absence of imposed disorder, many continuum quantum fluid systems (and possible
lattice counterparts) may exhibit a zero-point ""quantum dynamical
heterogeneity"" wherein the dynamics, at a given instant, is spatially
non-uniform. While the static length scales accompanying this phenomenon do not
exhibit a clear divergence in standard correlation functions, the length scale
of the dynamical heterogeneities can increase dramatically. We study ""quantum
jamming"" and illustrate how a hard core bosonic system may undergo a zero
temperature quantum critical metal-to-insulator-type transition with an
extremely large effective dynamical exponent z>4 consistent with length scales
that increase far more slowly than the relaxation time as a putative critical
transition is approached. We suggest ways to analyze experimental data.

cell becomes smaller to support high throughput. The reduced size of each cell
forces to install many cells, and consequently causes to increase inter-cell
interference at many cell edge areas. This paper considers a practical way of
mitigating interference at the receiver equipped with multiple antennas in
interference channels. Recently, it is shown that the capacity region of
interference channels over point-to-point codes could be established with a
combination of two schemes: treating interference as noise and jointly decoding
both desired and interference signals. In practice, the first scheme is
straightforwardly implementable, but the second scheme needs impractically huge
computational burden at the receiver. Within a practical range of complexity,
this paper proposes the interference-aware successive decoding (IASD) algorithm
which successively decodes desired and interference signals while updating a
priori information of both signals. When multiple decoders are allowed to be
used, the proposed IASD can be extended to interference-aware parallel decoding
(IAPD). The proposed algorithm is analyzed with extrinsic information transfer
(EXIT) chart so as to show that the interference decoding is advantageous to
improve the performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm significantly outperforms interference non-decoding algorithms.

with the 2MASS point source catalog to generate a catalog of eight band

molecular clouds by searching for point sources with mid-IR colors indicative
of reprocessed light from dusty disks or infalling envelopes. The YSOs are
subsequently classified on the basis of their mid-IR colors and their spatial
distributions are presented. We classify 2991 of the YSOs as pre-main sequence
stars with disks and 488 as likely protostars. Most of the sources were
observed with IRAC in 2-3 epochs over 6 months; we search for variability
between the epochs by looking for correlated variability in the 3.6 and 4.5

variations are typically small (0.2 mag.) with the protostars showing a higher
incidence of variability and larger variations. The observed correlations
between the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 micron variability suggests that we are
observing variations in the heating of the inner disk due to changes in the
accretion luminosity or rotating accretion hot spots.

Mobile Computing",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperative multicast is an effective solution to address the bottleneck
problem of single-hop broadcast in wireless networks. By incorporating with the
random linear network coding technique, the existing schemes can reduce the
retransmission overhead significantly. However, the receivers may incur large
decoding delay and complexity due to the batch decoding scheme. In addition,
the dependency on the explicit feedback leads to scalability problem in larger
networks. In this paper, a cooperative multicast protocol named MWNCast is
proposed based on a novel moving window network coding technique. We prove
three properties of the proposed scheme. Firstly, without explicit feedback,
MWNCast can approach the cooperative capacity with the packet loss probability
dropping almost exponentially with the increase of window size. Secondly, the
average decoding delay of a receiver is on the order of
$O(\frac{1}{(1-\rho)^2})$ with respect to its traffic intensity $\rho$.
Thirdly, MWNCast can achieve the linear decoding complexity of $O(W)$ with
respect to the window size $W$. Simulation results show that MWNCast
outperforms the existing schemes by achieving better tradeoff between the
throughput and decoding delay, meanwhile keeping the packet loss probability
and decoding complexity at a very low levelwithout explicit feedback.

self-organized criticality. Such criticality follows from the combination of a
simple neural network with an excitatory feedback loop that generates
bistability, in combination with an anti-Hebbian synapse in its input pathway.
Using the methods of statistical field theory, we show how one can formulate
the stochastic dynamics of such a network as the action of a path integral,
which we then investigate using renormalization group methods. The results
indicate that the network exhibits hysteresis in switching back and forward
between its two stable states, each of which loses its stability at a
saddle-node bifurcation. The renormalization group analysis shows that the
fluctuations in the neighborhood of such bifurcations have the signature of
directed percolation. Thus the network states undergo the neural analog of a
phase transition in the universality class of directed percolation. The network
replicates precisely the behavior of the original sand-pile model of Bak, Tang
& Wiesenfeld.

technological and scientific aspects of the radio technique. A first phase of
AERA has been operating since September 2010 with detector stations observing
radio signals at frequencies between 30 and 80 MHz. In this paper we present
comparative studies to identify and optimize the antenna design for the final
configuration of AERA consisting of 160 individual radio detector stations. The
transient nature of the air shower signal requires a detailed description of
the antenna sensor. As the ultra-wideband reception of pulses is not widely
discussed in antenna literature, we review the relevant antenna characteristics
and enhance theoretical considerations towards the impulse response of antennas
including polarization effects and multiple signal reflections. On the basis of
the vector effective length we study the transient response characteristics of
three candidate antennas in the time domain. Observing the variation of the
continuous galactic background intensity we rank the antennas with respect to
the noise level added to the galactic signal.

Their
main aim was to describe the statistics of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence
in spectral space, using a simple set of ordinary differential equations. In
the eighties, shell models of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence emerged
based on the same principles as their hydrodynamic counter-part but also
incorporating interactions between magnetic and velocity fields. In recent
years, significant improvements have been made such as the inclusion of
non-local interactions and appropriate definitions for helicities. Though shell
models cannot account for the spatial complexity of MHD turbulence, their
dynamics are not over simplified and do reflect those of real MHD turbulence
including intermittency or chaotic reversals of large-scale modes. Furthermore,
these models use realistic values for dimensionless parameters (high kinetic
and magnetic Reynolds numbers, low or high magnetic Prandtl number) allowing
extended inertial range and accurate dissipation rate. Using modern computers
it is difficult to attain an inertial range of three decades with direct
numerical simulations, whereas eight are possible using shell models. In this
review we set up a general mathematical framework allowing the description of
any MHD shell model. The variety of the latter, with their advantages and
weaknesses, is introduced. Finally we consider a number of applications,
dealing with free-decaying MHD turbulence, dynamo action, Alfven waves and the
Hall effect.

numerically solved the pulsar equation and obtained a pulsar magnetosphere
model called the CKF solution that has both closed and open magnetic field
lines. The CKF solution is a successful solution, but it contains a poloidal
current sheet that flows along the last open field line. This current sheet is
artificially added to make the current system closed. In this paper, we suggest
an alternative method to solve the pulsar equation and construct pulsar
magnetosphere models without a current sheet. In our method, the pulsar
equation is decomposed into Ampere's law and the force-free condition. We
numerically solve these equations simultaneously with a fixed poloidal current.
As a result, we obtain a pulsar magnetosphere model without a current sheet,
which is similar to the CKF solution near the neutron star and has a jet-like
structure at a distance along the pole. In addition, we discuss physical
properties of the model and find that the force-free condition breaks down in a

Besla et al.(2007) reconstructed LMC and SMC's orbits and suggested that they

utilize results of numerical simulations to consider a range of possible

array beamformer and rapid follow up at higher radio frequencies and other
wavelengths. Normally, such accurate positions can only be obtained from a
long-term pulsar timing program. The multi-pixel beamformer technique can also
be used for highly sensitive targeted pulsar searches in extended supernova

the existence of a temperature window within which the characteristics of the

  In our scheduling problem, jobs arrive over time and are preemptable. They
have different workloads, values, and deadlines. The scheduler may decide not
to finish a job but instead to suffer a loss equaling the job's value. However,
to process a job's workload until its deadline the scheduler must invest a
certain amount of energy. The cost of a schedule is the sum of lost values and
invested energy. In order to finish a job the scheduler has to determine which
processors to use and set their speeds accordingly. A processor's energy
consumption is power $\Power{s}$ integrated over time, where
$\Power{s}=s^{\alpha}$ is the power consumption when running at speed $s$.
Since we consider the online variant of the problem, the scheduler has no
knowledge about future jobs. This problem was introduced by
\textcite{Chan:2010} for the case of a single processor. They presented an
online algorithm which is $\alpha^{\alpha}+2e\alpha$-competitive. We provide an
online algorithm for the case of multiple processors with an improved
competitive ratio of $\alpha^{\alpha}$.

central engine of active galactic nuclei has been gathered with the assumption
of clumpiness. The properties of such clumpy dusty tori can be inferred by
analyzing spectral energy distributions (SEDs), sometimes with scarce sampling
given that large aperture telescopes and long integration times are needed to
get good spatial resolution and signal. We aim at using the information already
present in the data and the assumption of clumpy dusty torus, in particular,
the CLUMPY models of Nenkova et al., to evaluate the optimum next observation
such that we maximize the constraining power of the new observed photometric
point. To this end, we use the existing and barely applied idea of Bayesian
adaptive exploration, a mixture of Bayesian inference, prediction and decision
theories. The result is that the new photometric filter to use is the one that
maximizes the expected utility, which we approximate with the entropy of the
predictive distribution. In other words, we have to sample where there is
larger variability in the SEDs compatible with the data with what we know of
the model parameters. We show that Bayesian adaptive exploration can be used to
suggest new observations, and ultimately optimal filter sets, to better
constrain the parameters of the clumpy dusty torus models. In general, we find
that the region between 10 and 200 um produces the largest increase in the
expected utility, although sub-mm data from ALMA also prove to be useful. It is
important to note that here we are not considering the angular resolution of
the data, which is key when constraining torus parameters. Therefore, the
expected utilities derived from this methodology must be weighted with the
spatial resolution of the data.

launched from thin (Keplerian) accretion discs. Such winds are
magneto-centrifugal winds launched from a thin annulus in the disc, along open
magnetic field lines that fan out above the disc. In principle, such winds
could be found in two situations: (1) at the interface between an inner Jet
Emitting Disc, which is itself powering magneto-centrifugally driven winds, and
an outer standard accretion disc; (2) at the interface between an inner closed
stellar magnetosphere and the outer standard accretion disc. We refer to
Terminal or T-winds to the former kind and to Magnetospheric or M-winds to the
latter.
  The full set of resistive and viscous steady state MHD equations are analyzed
for the disc (the annulus), which allow us to derive general expressions valid
for both configurations. We find that, under the framework of our analysis, the
only source of energy able to power any kind of fan-shaped winds is the viscous
transport of rotational energy coming below the inner radii. Using standard
local $\alpha$ prescriptions for the anomalous (turbulent) transport of angular
momentum and magnetic fields in the disc, we derive the strength of the
transport coefficients that are needed to steadily sustain the global
configuration. It turns out that, in order for these winds to be dynamically
relevant and explain observed jets, the disc coefficients must be far much
larger than values expected from current knowledge of turbulence occurring
inside proto-stellar discs.
  Either the current view on MHD turbulence must be deeply reconsidered or
steady-state fan-shaped winds are never realized in Nature. The latter
hypothesis seems to be consistent with current numerical simulations.

has been proved and proposed to be used as a base for a chaos-vs-random test.
Both the experimental and the computed time series may be tested to detect
determinism. The result is a single number within the interval [0,2]. The test
is designed in such a way that its result is close to zero for the datasets
that are deterministic and smooth, and close to 2 for the datasets that are non
deterministic (random) or non smooth (discrete). A large variety of the test
results has been obtained for the calorimetric time series recorded in
thermokinetic oscillations, periodic and quasiperiodic, accompanying the
sorption of H2 or D2 with Pd as well as for several non oscillatory
calorimetric curves recorded in this reaction. These experimental datasets, all
coming form presumably deterministic processes, yielded the results clustering
around 0.001. On the other hand, certain databases that were presumably random
or non smooth yielded the test results from 0.7 to 1.9. Against these
benchmarks, the examined, experimental, aperiodic oscillations gave the test
results between 0.004 and 0.01, which appear to be much closer to the
deterministic behavior than to randomness. Consequently, it has been concluded
that the examined cases of aperiodic oscillations in the heat evolution

of mathematical chaos in the behavior of this system. Further applicability and

galaxies and radio sources to compute the extragalactic number counts and the
cosmic background from 408MHz to 12THz. The model of SF galaxies reproduces the
constraints obtained by Spitzer, Herschel, and ground-based submm/mm
experiments: number counts, redshift distribution of galaxies, cosmic
background intensity and anisotropies. The template SEDs of this model are
extrapolated to the radio adding synchrotron, free-free, and spinning dust
emissions. To fix the synchrotron intensity, we use the IR/radio flux ratio,
q70, and a spectral index beta=-3. For a constant q70, our model added to the
AGN contribution provides a good fit to the number counts from 12THz to 408MHz
and to the CIB. Spinning dust accounts for up to 20% of the cosmic microwave
background produced by SF galaxies, but for less than 10% of the total
background when AGN are included. The SF galaxies account for 77.5% of the
number counts at 1.4GHz for a flux of 1e-4Jy. However, the model does not
explain the CRB measured with the ARCADE2 experiment. Considering the case when
q70 decreases strongly with redshift, this still does not explain the ARCADE2
results. It also yields to an overestimate of the low-flux number counts in the
radio. Thus, we rule out a steep variation of q70 with redshift at least for
z<3.5. Adding a population of faint SF galaxies at high redshift (Lir<1e11Lsun
and 4<z<6), which would reproduce the ARCADE2 results, leads to predictions of
the CIB much higher than what is observed, ruling out this as the explanation
for the ARCADE2 results. Considering our findings and previous studies, we
conclude that if the radio emission measured by ARCADE2 is astrophysical in
origin, it has to originate in the Galaxy or in a new kind of radio sources

statistics analysis using maximum entropy models (MaxEnt). Most of these
studies have been focusing on modelling synchronous spike patterns, leaving
aside the temporal dynamics of the neural activity. However, the maximum
entropy principle can be generalized to the temporal case, leading to Markovian
models where memory effects and time correlations in the dynamics are properly
taken into account. In a second part, we present a new method based on
Monte-Carlo sampling which is suited for the fitting of large-scale

on the Brodie & Huchra method, and [Z/H], age, and [a/Fe] values of 33 GCs from
the comparison of the Lick line indices with single stellar population models.
The metallicity distribution of NGC 4636 GCs shows a hint of a bimodality with
two peaks at [Fe/H]=-1.23 (sigma=0.32) and -0.35 (sigma=0.19). The age spread
is large from 2 Gyr to 15 Gyr and the fraction of young GCs with age < 5 Gyr is
about 27%. The [a/Fe] of the GCs shows a broad distribution with a mean value
[a/Fe]~0.14 dex. The dependence of these chemical properties on the
galactocentric radius is weak. We also derive the metallicities, ages, and
[a/Fe] values for the GCs in other nearby gEs (M87, M49, M60, NGC 5128, NGC
1399, and NGC 1407) from the line index data in the literature using the same
methods as used for NGC 4636 GCs. The metallicity distribution of GCs in the
combined sample of seven gEs including NGC 4636 is found to be bimodal,
supported by the KMM test with a significance level of >99.9%. All these gEs
harbor some young GCs with ages less than 5 Gyr. The mean age of the metal-rich
GCs ([Fe/H] > -0.9) is about 3 Gyr younger than that of the metal-poor GCs. The
mean value of [a/Fe] of the gE GCs is smaller than that of the Milky Way GCs.
We discuss these results in the context of GC formation in gEs.

and $Z_i$ the graph obtained from a triangle by attaching a path of length $i$
to its one vertex. $G$ is called 1-heavy if at least one end vertex of each
induced claw of $G$ has degree at least $n/2$, and claw-\emph{o}-heavy if each
induced claw of it has a pair of end vertices with degree sum at least $n$. In
this paper we prove two results: (1) Every 2-connected claw-$o$-heavy graph $G$
is Hamiltonian if every pair of vertices $u,v$ in a subgraph $H\cong Z_1$
contained in an induced subgraph $Z_2$ of $G$ with $d_{H}(u,v)=2$ satisfies one
of the following conditions: ($a$) $|N(u)\cap N(v)|\geq 2$; ($b$)

state-machine representation we formulate the gathering problem and develop a

  The main idea behind our algorithm is for the robots to reach a configuration
in which all the following hold: (a) The robots' centers form a convex hull in
which all robots are on the convex, (b) Each robot can see all other robots,
and (c) The configuration is connected, that is, every robot touches another
robot and all robots together form a connected formation. We show that starting
from any initial configuration, the robots, making only local decisions and
coordinate by vision, eventually reach such a configuration and terminate,
yielding a solution to the gathering problem.

Our observations have an angular resolution of about 0.11"", providing an upper
limit on the cluster radius of 2.85+/-0.50 pc depending on the assumed
distance. The K-band spectrum is dominated by strong CO absorption bandheads
typical of red supergiants. Its spectral type is equivalent to a K4-5I star.
Using evolutionary tracks from the Geneva and Utrecht groups, we determine an
age of 12+/-6 Myr. The large uncertainty is rooted in the large difference
between the Geneva and Utrecht tracks in the red supergiants regime. The
absence of ionized gas lines in the K-band spectrum is consistent with the
absence of O and/or Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster, as expected for the
estimated age.

class numbers and give rise to modular forms of weight $3/2$. This generalizes
Klyachko's computation on $\mathbb{P}^2$ and is consistent with $S$-duality

with hyperthermia have a potential of improving the efficacy of the
non-surgical methods of cancer treatment. Hyperthermia engages the heat-shock
response mechanism (HSR), main component of which are heat-shock proteins
(HSP). Cancer cells have already partially activated HSR, thereby, hyperthermia
may be more toxic to them relative to normal cells. On the other hand, HSR
triggers thermotolerance, i.e. hyperthermia treated cells show an impairment in
their susceptibility to a subsequent heat-induced stress. This poses questions
about efficacy and optimal strategy of the anti-cancer therapy combined with
hyperthermia treatment.
  To address these questions, we adapt our previous HSR model and propose its
stochastic extension. We formalise the notion of a HSP-induced thermotolerance.
Next, we estimate the intensity and the duration of the thermotolerance.
Finally, we quantify the effect of a multimodal therapy based on hyperthermia
and a cytotoxic effect of bortezomib, a clinically approved proteasome
inhibitor. Consequently, we propose an optimal strategy for combining
hyperthermia and proteasome inhibition modalities.
  In summary, by a proof of concept mathematical analysis of HSR we are able to
support the common belief that the combination of cancer treatment strategies
increases therapy efficacy. thermotolerance.

the two-dimensional Hubbard model on the square lattice at weak to moderate
coupling strength. Previous studies using the functional renormalization group
had ignored these two ingredients to large extent, and the question is how much
the flows to strong coupling analyzed by this method depend on these
approximations. Here we include the imaginary part of the self-energy on the
imaginary axis and the frequency-dependence of the running interactions on a
frequency mesh of 10 frequencies on the Matsubara axis. We find that i) the
critical scales for the flows to strong coupling are shifted downwards by a
factor that is usually of order one but can get larger in specific parameter
regions, and ii) that the leading channel in this flow does not depend strongly
on whether self-energies and frequency-dependence is included or not. We also
discuss the main features of the self-energies developing during the flows.

  The main result of this paper is to give a sharp estimate for C_p in terms of
p. Namely, we show that C_p ~ p^2/(p-1). In particular, this gives the best
estimates for operator Lipschitz inequalities.
  We treat this result in a more general setting. This involves commutators of

HCO+ . Bright [OI]63,145um and weaker [CII]158 and [CI]370,609um lines are also

discussed here, they show clear detections of [NeII], [FeII], [SiII] and [SI]
fine structure lines as well as weaker H2 S(1) and S(2) pure rotational lines.
The observed line luminosity is dominated by CO (~54%), H2O (~22%), [OI] (~12%)
and OH (~9%) emission. A non-LTE radiative transfer model allowed us to
quantify the contribution of the 3 different temperature components suggested
by the 12CO rotational ladder (Tk(hot)~800 K, Tk(warm)~375 K and Tk(cool)~150
K). Gas densities n(H2)~5x10^6 cm^-3 are needed to reproduce the observed
far-IR lines arising from shocks in the inner protostellar envelope for which
we derive upper limit abundances of x(CO)~10^-4, x(H2O)~0.2x10^-5 and
x(OH)~10^-6. The lower energy submm 12CO and H2O lines show more extended
emission that we associate with the cool entrained outflow gas. Fast
dissociative J-shocks (v_s > 60 km s^-1) as well as lower velocity
non-dissociative shocks (v_s < 20 km s^-1) are needed to explain both the
atomic lines and the hot CO and H2O lines respectively. Observations also show
the signature of UV radiation and thus, most observed species likely arise in
UV-irradiated shocks. Dissociative J-shocks produced by an atomic jet are the
most probable origin of [OI] and OH emission and of a significant fraction of
the warm CO emission. In addition, H2O photodissociation in UV-irradiated
non-dissociative shocks can also contribute to the [OI] and OH emission.

0.68<z<4 down to extinction corrected magnitude g_dered=22.5, using a simple
and well understood target selection technique based on the time-variability of
quasars. The completeness of our sample was derived directly from a control
sample of quasars, without requiring complex simulations of quasar light-curves
or colors. A total of 1877 quasar spectra were obtained from dedicated programs
on the Sloan telescope (as part of the SDSS-III/BOSS survey) and on the
Multiple Mirror Telescope. They allowed us to derive the quasar luminosity
function. It agrees well with previously published results in the redshift
range 0.68<z<2.6. Our deeper data allow us to extend the measurement to z=4. We
measured quasar densities to g_dered<22.5, obtaining 30 QSO per deg^2 at z<1,
99 QSO per deg^2 for 1<z<2.15, and 47 QSO per deg^2 at z>2.15. Using pure
luminosity evolution models, we fitted our LF measurements, and predicted
quasar number counts as a function of redshift and observed magnitude. These
predictions are useful inputs for future cosmology surveys such as those
relying on the observation of quasars to measure baryon acoustic oscillations.

spatial structures that have been imaged in debris discs. So far this issue has
been mostly investigated with collisionless N-body numerical models. We
numerically investigate how the coupled effect of collisions and radiation
pressure can affect the formation and survival of radial and azimutal
structures in a disc perturbed by a planet. We consider two set-ups: a planet
embedded within an extended disc and a planet exterior to an inner debris ring.
We use the DyCoSS code of Thebault(2012) and derive synthetic images of the
system in scattered light. The planet's mass and orbit, as well as the disc's
collisional activity are explored as free parameters.
  We find that collisions always significantly damp planet-induced structures.
For the case of an embedded planet, the planet's signature, mostly a density
gap around its radial position, should remain detectable in head-on images if
M_planet > M_Saturn. If the system is seen edge-on, however, inferring the
presence of the planet is much more difficult, although some planet-induced
signatures might be observable under favourable conditions.
  For the inner-ring/external-planet case, planetary perturbations cannot
prevent collision-produced small fragments from populating the regions beyond
the ring: The radial luminosity profile exterior to the ring is close to the
one it should have in the absence of the planet. However, a Jovian planet on a
circular orbit leaves precessing azimutal structures that can be used to
indirectly infer its presence. For a planet on an eccentric orbit, the ring is
elliptic and the pericentre glow effect is visible despite of collisions and
radiation pressure, but detecting such features in real discs is not an
unambiguous indicator of the presence of an outer planet.

a continuous crossover to gel formation. We identify two regimes, `classical'
phase separation, where single particle relaxation is faster than the dynamics
of phase separation, and `viscoelastic' phase separation, where demixing is
slowed down appreciably due to slow dynamics in the colloid-rich phase.
Particles at the surface of the strands of the network exhibit significantly
greater mobility than those buried inside the gel strand which presents a

the redundancy added in distributed storage environments. The use of
regenerating codes not only make the most of the erasure coding improvements,
but also minimizes the amount of data needed to regenerate a failed node.
  In this paper, a new family of regenerating codes based on quasi-cyclic codes
is presented. Quasi-cyclic flexible minimum storage regenerating (QCFMSR) codes
are constructed and their existence is proved. Quasi-cyclic flexible
regenerating codes with minimum bandwidth constructed from a base QCFMSR code
are also provided. These codes not only achieve optimal MBR parameters in terms
of stored data and repair bandwidth, but also for an specific choice of the
parameters involved, they can be decreased under the optimal MBR point.
  Quasi-cyclic flexible regenerating codes are very interesting because of
their simplicity and low complexity. They allow exact repair-by-transfer in the
minimum bandwidth case and an exact pseudo repair-by-transfer in the MSR case,
where operations are needed only when a new node enters into the system

exceeds some value) is an important problem with applications in digital
elevation mapping, medical imaging, astronomy, etc. In many applications, the
function of interest is not observed directly. Rather, it is acquired through
(linear) projection measurements, such as tomographic projections,
interferometric measurements, coded-aperture measurements, and random
projections associated with compressed sensing. This paper describes a new
methodology for rapid and accurate estimation of the level set from such
projection measurements. The key defining characteristic of the proposed
method, called the projective level set estimator, is its ability to estimate
the level set from projection measurements without an intermediate
reconstruction step. This leads to significantly faster computation relative to
heuristic ""plug-in"" methods that first estimate the function, typically with an
iterative algorithm, and then threshold the result. The paper also includes a
rigorous theoretical analysis of the proposed method, which utilizes the recent
results from the non-asymptotic theory of random matrices results from the
literature on concentration of measure and characterizes the estimator's
performance in terms of geometry of the measurement operator and 1-norm of the
discretized function.

(i.e. the number of phonon species, the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the thermal
wavelengths of the mixture). The primary and secondary graviton spectra are
shown to be sensitive, respectively, to the first-order and second-order

I. Siegel was curious if the wetting fluid would expel from the end of short
capillary tubes in a low-gravity environment. He observed that although the
fluid partially left the tubes, it was always pulled back by surface tension,
which caused the fluid to remain pinned to the tubes' end. By exploiting tube
geometry and fluid properties, we demonstrate that such capillary flows can in
fact eject a variety of jets and drops. This fluid dynamics video provides a
historical overview of such spontaneous capillarity-driven droplet ejection.
Footage of terrestrial and low earth orbit experiments are also shown. Droplets
generated in a microgravity environment are $10^6$ times larger than those
ejected in a terrestrial environment. The accompanying article provides a
summary of the critical parameters and experimental procedures. Scaling the
governing equations reveals the dimensionless groups that identify topological
regimes of droplet behavior which provides a novel perspective from which to
further investigate jets, droplets, and other capillary phenomena over large

($\geq$0.1 GeV) emitters with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) aboard the
\emph{Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope}. Most MSP gamma-ray light curves display
sharp peaks indicative of thin accelerating gaps, suggesting copious
pair-creation in the open volume. MSP gamma-ray and radio light curves have
been simulated using geometric outer-gap (OG), slot-gap/two-pole caustic (TPC),
and pair-starved polar cap gamma-ray models and either a hollow-cone beam or
altitude-limited, outer-magnetospheric gap radio model, all assuming a vacuum
retarded dipolar magnetic field geometry. A Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum
likelihood technique has been developed to find the best-fit model parameters
for nineteen MSPs using data from the LAT and various radio observatories. The
best-fit viewing angles follow a uniform, angular distribution. The
distribution of magnetic inclination angles favors all angles equally, contrary
to analyses of non-recycled pulsars, which supports the theory that MSPs have
been spun-up via accretion. There are suggestions that the radio emission
should occur nearer the light cylinder. These results have implications for MSP
population simulations and for addressing MSP contributions to diffuse
backgrounds. An implied transition in the gamma-ray luminosity versus spin-down
power trend is observed but more statistics are necessary to describe it.
