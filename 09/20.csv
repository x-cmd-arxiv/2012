practically realizable. More pragmatic approach to artificial general
intelligence is based on cognitive architectures, which are, however,
non-universal in sense that they can construct and use models of the
environment only from Turing-incomplete model spaces. We believe that the way
to the real AGI consists in bridging the gap between these two approaches. This
is possible if one considers cognitive functions as a ""cognitive bias"" (priors
and search heuristics) that should be incorporated into the models of universal
algorithmic intelligence without violating their universality. Earlier reported
results suiting this approach and its overall feasibility are discussed on the
example of perception, planning, knowledge representation, attention, theory of
mind, language, and some others.

for CEE-related work, we mostly try to avoid relying on results from population

issues starting from physics alone, all the way from the evolution of the
binary system immediately before CEE begins to the processes which might occur
just after the ejection of the envelope. In particular, we include extensive
discussion about the energy sources and sinks operating in CEE, and hence
examine the foundations of the standard energy formalism. Special attention is
also given to comparing the results of hydrodynamic simulations from different
groups and to discussing the potential effect of initial conditions on the
differences in the outcomes. We compare current numerical techniques for the
problem of CEE and also whether more appropriate tools could and should be
produced (including new formulations of computational hydrodynamics, and
attempts to include 3D processes within 1D codes). Finally we explore new ways
to link CEE with observations. We compare previous simulations of CEE to the

analysis of the new data shows that the star-formation efficiency of the dense

hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The structure and properties of HA,
which is responsible for binding the virus to the cell that is being infected,
change significantly when the virus is transmitted from avian or swine species
to humans. Previously we identified much smaller human individual evolutionary
amino acid mutational changes in NA, which cleaves sialic acid groups and is
required for influenza virus replication. We showed that these smaller changes
can be monitored very accurately across many Uniprot and NCBI strains using
hydropathicity scales to quantify the roughness of water film packages, which
increases gradually due to migration, but decreases abruptly under large-scale
vaccination pressures. Here we show that, while HA evolution is much more
complex, it still shows abrupt punctuation changes linked to those of NA. HA
exhibits proteinquakes, which resemble earthquakes and are related to
hydropathic shifting of sialic acid binding regions. HA proteinquakes based on
sialic acid interactions are required for optimal balance between the
receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities of HA and NA for efficient
virus replication. Our comprehensive results present an historical (1945-2011)
panorama of HA evolution over thousands of strains, and are consistent with
many studies of HA and NA interactions based on a few mutations of a few
strains. While the common influenza virus discussed here has been rendered
almost harmless by decades of vaccination programs, the sequential decoding
lessons learned here are applicable to other viruses that are emerging as
powerful weapons for controlling and even curing common organ cancers. Those
engineered oncolytic drugs will be discussed in future papers.

new white dwarf candidates. We review the membership of these candidates by
using published spectroscopic and photometric observations, as well as by
simulating the contamination from field white dwarfs. In addition to the ten
classical Hyades white dwarfs, we find six white dwarfs that may be of Hyades
origin and three more objects that have an uncertain membership status due to
their unknown or imprecise atmospheric parameters. Among those, two to three
are expected as field stars contamination. Accurate radial velocity
measurements will confirm or reject the candidates. One consequence is that the

limits on the masses of the gluinos ($\tilde{g}$) and the squarks of the first
two generations ($\tilde{q}$) to the TeV range. On the other hand, the limits
are rather weak for the third generation squarks and masses around a few
hundred GeV are still allowed. A comparatively light third generation of
squarks is also consistent with the lightest Higgs boson with mass $\sim$ 125
GeV. In view of this, we consider the direct production of a pair of sbottom
quarks ($\tilde{b}_1$) at the LHC and study their collider signatures. We focus
on the scenario where the $\tilde{b}_1$ is not the next-to-lightest
supersymmetric particle (NLSP) and hence can also decay to channels other than
the commonly considered decay mode to a bottom quark and the lightest
neutralino ($\tilde{\chi}^0_1$). For example, we consider the decay modes
containing a bottom quark and the second neutralino ($\tilde{b}_1 \to b
\tilde{\chi}^0_2$) and/or a top quark and the lightest chargino ($\tilde{b}_1
\to t \tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_1$) following the leptonic decays of the neutralino,
chargino and the top quark giving rise to a 4 leptons ($\ell$) + 2 $b$-jets +
missing transverse momentum ($\PMET$) final state. We show that an sbottom mass
$\lesssim$ 550 GeV can be probed in this channel at the 14 TeV LHC energy with

One issue is that the
compelling candidate a-function, from a-maximization with Lagrange multipliers,
has a `strange branch,"" with reversed RG flow properties, monotonically
increasing instead of decreasing. The branch flip to the strange branch occurs
where a double-trace deformation Delta W=O ^2 passes through marginality,
reminiscent of the condition for the chiral symmetry breaking, out of the
conformal window transition in non-susy gauge theories. The second issue arises
from Higgsing vevs for IR-free fields, which sometimes superficially violate
the a-theorem. The resolution is that some vevs trigger marginal or irrelevant
interactions, leading to Delta a=0 and decoupled dilaton on a subspace of the
moduli space of vacua. This is contrary to classical intuition about Higgsing.
This phenomenon often (but not always) correlates with negative R-charge for
the Higgsing chiral operator.

this approach cannot exploit the full potential offered by the probabilistic

its general mathematical properties provide an effective algorithm for the

observe new complex behaviors. It was shown that many of these materials
exhibit shear banding in a homogeneous shear stress field, which cannot be
accounted for by the standard steady-state constitutive laws of simple yield

under various conditions cannot be modeled with a single constitutive law and
that nonlocal models are needed to describe the flows. Doubt may then be cast
on any macroscopic characterization of such systems, and one may wonder if any

paper, we address the question of the existence of a simple yield stress fluid
behavior. We first review experimental results from the literature and we point
out the main factors (physical properties, experimental procedure) at the
origin of flow inhomogeneities and nonlocal effects. It leads us to propose a
well-defined procedure to ensure that steady-state bulk properties of the
materials are studied. We use this procedure to investigate yield stress fluid
flows with MRI techniques. We focus on nonthixotropic dense suspensions of soft
particles (foams, concentrated emulsions, Carbopol gels). We show that, as long
as they are studied in a wide (as compared to the size of the material
mesoscopic elements) gap geometry, these materials behave as 'simple yield
stress fluids': they are homogeneous, they do not exhibit steady-state shear
banding, and their steady flow behavior in simple shear can be modeled by a
local continuous monotonic constitutive equation which accounts for flows in
various conditions and matches the macroscopic response.

condensed matter physics and functional materials. Depending on the strength of
the interaction between the molecule and the surface, the binding is typically
classified as either physisorption or chemisorption. Van der Waals (vdW)
interactions contribute significantly to the binding in physisorbed systems,
but the role of the vdW energy in chemisorbed systems remains unclear. Here we
study the interaction of benzene with the (111) surface of transition metals,
ranging from weak adsorption (Ag and Au) to strong adsorption (Pt, Pd, Ir, and
Rh). When vdW interactions are accurately accounted for, the barrier to
adsorption predicted by standard density functional theory (DFT) calculations
essentially vanishes, producing a metastable precursor state on Pt and Ir
surfaces. Notably, vdW forces contribute more to the binding of covalently
bonded benzene than they do when benzene is physisorbed. Comparison to
experimental data demonstrates that some of the recently developed methods for
including vdW interactions in DFT allow quantitative treatment of both weakly
and strongly adsorbed aromatic molecules on metal surfaces, extending the
already excellent performance found for gas-phase molecules.

Dynamical mean-field theory shows that when the density approaches
half-filling, the fcc lattice at strong coupling exhibits a large low
temperature Seebeck coefficient $S$. The largest effect occurs as one
approaches $n=1$ from dopings where electronic frustration is maximized. The
high-frequency limit of the thermopower and the Kelvin limit are both used to
provide physical insight as well as practical tools to estimate the
thermopower. The high-frequency limit gives a reliable estimate of the DC limit
at low temperature when the metal becomes coherent. By contrast, the Kelvin
approach is useful in the strongly interacting case at high temperature when
transport is incoherent. The latter result shows that in doped Mott insulators

entropic grounds.

GC systems, such as their spatial and colour distributions, we focus on the
kinematics of metal-poor (blue) and metal-rich (red) GC subpopulations to an
average distance of ~8 effective radii from the galaxy centre. Our results show
that for some systems the bimodality in GC colour is also present in GC
kinematics. The kinematics of the red GC subpopulations are strongly coupled
with the host galaxy stellar kinematics. The blue GC subpopulations are more
dominated by random motions, especially in the outer regions, and decoupled
from the red GCs. Peculiar GC kinematic profiles are seen in some galaxies: the
blue GCs in NGC 821 rotate along the galaxy minor axis, whereas the GC system
of the lenticular galaxy NGC 7457 appears to be strongly rotation supported in
the outer region. We supplement our galaxy sample with data from the literature

found in various environments. Objects with masses comparable to globular
clusters (GCs) are called extended clusters (ECs), while objects with masses in
the dwarf galaxy regime are called ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). The
paper analyses the observational parameters luminosity, effective radius, and
projected distance to the host galaxy, of all known ECs and UCDs and the
dependence of these parameters on the type and the luminosity of their host
galaxy. We searched the available literature to compile a catalog of star
clusters larger than 10 pc. As there is no clear distinction between ECs and
UCDs, both types of objects will be called extended stellar objects (EOs). In
total, we found 813 EOs of which 171 are associated with late-type and 642 with
early-type galaxies. EOs cover a luminosity range from about MV = -4 to -14
mag. However, the vast majority of EOs brighter than -10 mag are associated
with elliptical galaxies. At each magnitude EOs are found with effective radii
between 10 pc and an upper size limit, which shows a clear trend: the more
luminous the object the larger is the upper size limit. For EOs associated with
early-and late-type galaxies, the luminosity functions peak at -6.40 and -6.47
mag, respectively, which is about one magnitude fainter than the peak of the GC
luminosity function. EOs and GCs form a coherent structure in the reff vs. MV
parameter space, while there is a clear gap between EOs and early type dwarf
galaxies. However, there is a small potential overlap at the high-mass end,
where the most extended EOs are close to the parameters of compact elliptical
galaxies. We compare the EO sample with numerical models and conclude that the
parameters of the EO sample as a whole can be very well explained by a star
cluster origin, where EOs are the results of merged cluster complexes.

planet-disk interaction in stratified disks with varied thermodynamic

the planet, with a reduction in the traditional ""torque cutoff"". In particular,
this is true for adiabatic perturbations in disks with isothermal density
structure, as should be typical for centrally irradiated protoplanetary disks.
We identify this torque with buoyancy waves, which are excited (when N is
non-zero) close to the planet, within one disk scale height from its orbit.
These waves give rise to density perturbations with a characteristic 3D spatial
pattern which is in close agreement with the linear dispersion relation for
buoyancy waves. The torque due to these waves can amount to as much as several
tens of per cent of the total planetary torque, which is not expected based on
analytical calculations limited to axisymmetric or low-m modes. Buoyancy waves
should be ubiquitous around planets in the inner, dense regions of
protoplanetary disks, where they might possibly affect planet migration.

nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational
inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived
variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend
and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific
models; and they work well on real-world datasets. We studied our methods on

complete transit of KOI-94.01 for $\sim 6.7$ hours. The resulting RV variation

transiting planet, and implies that its orbital axis is well aligned with the
stellar spin axis; the projected spin-orbit angle $\lambda$ is estimated as
$-6_{-11}^{+13}$ deg. This is the first measurement of the RM effect for a
multiple transiting system. Remarkably, the archived Kepler lightcurve around
BJD=2455211.5 (date in UT January 14/15, 2010) indicates a ""ouble transit""
event of KOI-94.01 and KOI-94.03, in which the two planets transit the stellar
disk simultaneously. Moreover, the two planets partially overlap each other,
and exhibit a ""planet-planet eclipse"" around the transit center. This provides
a rare opportunity to put tight constraints on the configuration of the two
transiting planets by joint analysis with our Subaru RM measurement. Indeed, we
find that the projected mutual inclination of KOI-94.01 and KOI-94.03 is
estimated to be $\delta = -1.15 \pm 0.55$ deg. Implications for the migration
model of multiple planet systems are also discussed.

We aim to investigate the nature of this supernova remnant in order to unveil
the origin of its particular morphology. We based our work on the study of the
X-ray emitting plasma properties and the conditions imposed by the cold
interstellar medium where the remnant expanded. We use archival radio, HI line
data and X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and Chandra observatories, to study
G290.1-0.8 and its surrounding medium. Spatially resolved spectral analysis and
mean photon energy maps are used to obtain physical and geometrical parameters
of the source. Radio continuum and HI line maps give crucial information to
understand the radio/X-ray morphology. The X-ray images show that the remnant
presents two opposite symmetric bright spots on a symmetry axis running towards
the NW-SE direction. Spectral analysis and mean photon energy maps confirm that
the physical conditions of the emitting plasma are not homogeneous throughout
the remnant. In fact, both bright spots have higher temperatures than the rest
of the plasma and its constituents have not reached ionization equilibrium yet.
HI line data reveal low density tube-like structures aligned along the same
direction. This evidence supports the idea that the particular X-ray morphology
observed is a direct consequence of the structure of the interstellar medium
where the remnant evolved. However, the possibility that an undetected
point-like object, as a neutron star, exists within the remnant and contributes
to the X-ray emission cannot be discarded. Finally, we suggest that a supernova
explosion due to the collapse of a high-mass star with a strong bipolar wind
can explain the supernova remnant morphology.

unrelated physical characteristics of galaxies, testify to an underlying order
in galaxy formation that requires understanding. I review the development of a
scaling relation that 1) unites the well-known Fundamental Plane (FP) relation
of giant elliptical galaxies and Tully-Fisher (TF) relation of disk galaxies,
2) fits low mass spheroidal galaxies, including the ultra-faint satellites of
our Galaxy, 3) explains the apparent shift of lenticular (S0) galaxies relative
to both FP or TF, 3) describes all stellar dynamical systems, including systems
with no dark matter (stellar clusters), 4) associates explicitly the numerical
coefficients that account for the apparent ""tilt"" of the FP away from the
direct expectation drawn from the virial theorem with systematic variations in
the total mass-to-light ratio of galaxies within the half-light radius, 5)
connects with independent results that demonstrate the robustness of mass
estimators when applied at the half-light radius, and 6) results in smaller
scatter for disk galaxies than the TF relation. The relation develops naturally
from the virial theorem, but implies the existence of additional galaxy
formation physics that must now be a focus of galaxy formation studies. More
pragmatically, the relation provides a lynchpin that can be used to measure
distances and galaxy masses. I review two applications: 1) the
cross-calibration of distance measurement methods, and 2) the determination of
mass-to-light ratios of simple stellar populations as a function of age, and
implications of the latter for the stellar initial mass function.

guarantee, is a promising technique to improve throughput in wireless multi-hop
networks. Although backpressure is conceptually viewed as layered, the
decisions of routing and scheduling are made jointly, which imposes several
challenges in practice. In this work, we present Diff-Max, an approach that
separates routing and scheduling and has three strengths: (i) Diff-Max improves
throughput significantly, (ii) the separation of routing and scheduling makes
practical implementation easier by minimizing cross-layer operations; i.e.,
routing is implemented in the network layer and scheduling is implemented in
the link layer, and (iii) the separation of routing and scheduling leads to
modularity; i.e., routing and scheduling are independent modules in Diff-Max,
and one can continue to operate even if the other does not. Our approach is
grounded in a network utility maximization (NUM) formulation and its solution.
Based on the structure of Diff-Max, we propose two practical schemes:
Diff-subMax and wDiff-subMax. We demonstrate the benefits of our schemes
through simulation in ns-2.

submanifolds of Euclidean space to solve the Plateau problem. Here we prove the
upper semicontinuity of Neumann eigenvalues of the submanifolds when they
converge in the flat sense without losing volume. With an additional condition
on the boundaries of the submanifolds we prove the Dirichlet eigenvalues are
semicontinuous as well. We show this additional boundary condition is necessary
as well as the condition that the volumes converge to the volume of the limit
submanifold. As an application of our theorems we see that the Dirichlet and
Neumann eigenvalues of a sequence of surfaces with a common smooth boundary
curve approaching the solution to the Plateau problem are upper semicontinuous.
This work is built upon Fukaya's study of the metric measure convergence of
Riemannian manifolds. One may recall that Cheeger-Colding proved continuity of
the eigenvalues when manifolds with uniform lower Ricci curvature bounds
converge in the metric measure sense. While they obtain continuity, here, we
produce an example demonstrating that continuity is impossible to obtain with
our weaker hypothesis.

active regions from the first imprints of the magnetic field on the solar
surface. To this end, we followed the first 24 hours in the life of two rather
isolated ARs that appeared on the surface when they were about to cross the
central meridian. We analyze the correlations between Doppler velocities and
the orientation of the vector magnetic field finding, consistently, that the
horizontal fields connecting the main polarities are dragged to the surface by
relatively-strong upflows and are associated to elongated granulation that is,
on average, brighter than its surroundings. The main magnetic footpoints, on
the other hand, are dominated by vertical fields and downflowing plasma. The
appearance of moving dipolar features, MDFs, (of opposite polarity to that of
the AR) in between the main footpoints, is a rather common occurrence once the
AR reaches a certain size. The buoyancy of the fields is insufficient to lift
up the magnetic arcade as a whole. Instead, weighted by the plasma that it
carries, the field is pinned down to the photosphere at several places in
between the main footpoints, giving life to the MDFs and enabling channels of
downflowing plasma. MDF poles tend to drift towards each other, merge and
disappear. This is likely to be the signature of a reconnection process in the
dipped field lines, which relieves some of the weight allowing the magnetic
arcade to finally rise beyond the detection layer of the HMI spectral line.

sources over a network with multiple sinks, which consists of distributed
source coding followed by routing. We introduce a new routing paradigm called
dispersive information routing, wherein the intermediate nodes are allowed to
`split' a packet and forward subsets of the received bits on each of the
forward paths. This paradigm opens up a rich class of research problems which
focus on the interplay between encoding and routing in a network. Unlike
conventional routing methods such as in [1], dispersive information routing
ensures that each sink receives just the information needed to reconstruct the
sources it is required to reproduce. We demonstrate using simple examples that
our approach offers better asymptotic performance than conventional routing
techniques. This paradigm leads to a new information theoretic setup, which has
not been studied earlier. We propose a new coding scheme, using principles from
multiple descriptions encoding [2] and Han and Kobayashi decoding [3]. We show
that this coding scheme achieves the complete rate region for certain special
cases of the general setup and thereby achieves the minimum communication cost
under this routing paradigm.

the measures have a complete orthogonal exponential system and hence spectral
measures. We then characterize all the maximal orthogonal sets $\Lambda$ when
$q$ divides $b$ via a maximal mapping on the $q-$adic tree in which all
elements in $\Lambda$ are represented uniquely in finite $b-$adic expansions
and we can separate the maximal orthogonal sets into two types: regular and
irregular sets. For a regular maximal orthogonal set, we show that its
completeness in $L^2(\mu_{q,b})$ is crucially determined by the certain growth
rate of non-zero digits in the tail of the $b-$adic expansions of the elements.
Furthermore, we exhibit complete orthogonal exponentials with zero Beurling
dimensions. These examples show that the technical condition in Theorem 3.5 of

mechanism is closest to the standard fireball model. This model over-predicts
the thermal photospheric emission and used to contradict observations.
Lightcurves at different energy bands revealed two distinguishable phases that
may come from different regions. First, we have an early phase, which is not
detected by LAT, and is dominated by lower energies, which arises from the
photospheric emissions without any emissions involved in dissipation mechanisms
and characterized by low Lorentz factor and high radiation efficiency. This is
followed by a later phase, having a more complex structure that remarkably
follows the same track in all energy bands and is attributed to emissions from
internal shocks. This burst is a good candidate to study both thermal and
non-thermal emissions, since the two phases can be clearly separated in
lightcurve and spectrum. The rapid variation of Lorentz factor and the values
of photospheric radii, which are relatively far away from the central engine in
Phase 2, are more consistent with the mechanism of collisional heating in
baryonic jets. Further information can be obtained by combining more
wavelengths with the help of the other detectors.

origin. We discuss results from ongoing B and V observations of the gam Cas
star-disk system acquired with an APT during the observing seasons 1997-2011.
In an earlier study, Smith, Henry, & Vishniac showed that light variations in
gam Cas are dominated by a series of comparatively prominent cycles with
amplitudes of 0.02-0.03 mag and lengths of 2-3 months, superimposed on a
1.21-day periodic signal some five times smaller, which they attributed to
rotation. The cycle lengths clustered around 70 days. Changes in both cycle
length and amplitude were observed from year to year. These authors also found
the V-band cycles to be 30-40% larger than the B-band cycles. In the present
study we find continued evidence for these variability patterns and for the
bimodal distribution of the B/V amplitude ratios in the long cycles. During the
2010 observing season, gam Cas underwent a mass loss event (outburst), as
evidenced by the brightening and reddening seen in our new photometry. This
episode coincided with a waning of the amplitude in the ongoing cycle. The Be
outburst ended the following year, and the light-curve amplitude returned to
pre-outburst levels. This behavior reinforces the interpretation that cycles
arise from a global disk instability. Remarkably, we also find that both the
amplitude and the asymmetry of the rotational waveform changed over the years.
We review arguments for this modulation arising from transits of a surface
magnetic disturbance. Finally, to a limit of 5 mmag, we find no evidence for
any photometric variation corresponding to the gam Cas binary period, 203.55
days, or to the first few harmonics.

extract the Keplerian velocity field of the disk from these data and estimate
the total mass of the central binary. Assuming the distance inferred from
kinematic parallax measurements in the literature (d is approximately 73 pc),
we determine a total stellar mass M_star = 1.75^{+0.09}_{-0.06} solar masses
and a disk inclination i_d = 33.5^{+0.7}_{-1.4} degrees from face-on. These
measurements are in excellent agreement with independent dynamical constraints
made from multi-epoch monitoring of the stellar radial velocities, confirming
the absolute accuracy of this precise (~ few percent uncertainties) disk-based
method for estimating stellar masses and reaffirming previous assertions that
the disk and binary orbital planes are well aligned (with |i_d - i_star|
\approx 0.1\pm1 degree). Using these results as a reference, we demonstrate
that various pre-main sequence evolution models make consistent and accurate
predictions for the masses of the individual components of the binary, and
uniformly imply an advanced age of ~5-30 Myr. Taken together, these results
verify that V4046 Sgr is one of the precious few nearby and relatively evolved
pre-main sequence systems that still hosts a gas-rich accretion disk.

variational data assimilation using measurement data combined with assumptions
on the smoothness of the propagator. This approach is illustrated using a
generalized dynamic model describing oscillatory transients from an unstable

dominant oscillation and an algebraic manifold for the low- and high-frequency

identification technique employs mode amplitudes of the transient vortex
shedding in a cylinder wake flow as example measurements. The reconstruction

the well-known mean-field (Landau) model of the Hopf bifurcation. The
computational aspect of the identification method is thoroughly validated

metal-insulator-transition (MIT) in three-dimensional amorphous indium-oxide
films. The amorphous version studied here differs from the one reported earlier
[PRB 46, 10917 (1992)] in that it has a much lower carrier concentration. As a
measure of the static disorder we use the dimensionless parameter kFl. Thermal
annealing is employed as the experimental handle to tune the disorder. On the
metallic side of the transition, the low temperature transport exhibits
weak-localization and electron-electron correlation effects characteristic of
disordered electronic systems. The MIT occurs at a kFl~0.3 for both versions of
the amorphous material. However, in contrast with the results obtained on the
electron-rich version of this system, no sign of superconductivity is seen down
to ~0.3K even for the most metallic sample used in the current study. This
demonstrates that using kFl as a disorder parameter for the
superconductor-insulator-transition (SIT) is an ill defined procedure. A
microstructural study of the films, employing high resolution chemical
analysis, gives evidence for spatial fluctuations of the stoichiometry. This
brings to light that, while the films are amorphous and show excellent
uniformity in transport measurements of macroscopic samples, they contain
compositional fluctuations that extend over mesoscopic scales. It is argued
that this compositional disorder may be the reason for the apparent violation
of the Ioffe-Regel criterion in the two versions of the amorphous indium-oxide.
However, more dramatic effects due to this disorder are expected when
superconductivity sets in, which are in fact consistent with the prominent
transport anomalies observed in the electron-rich version of indium-oxide. The
relevance of compositional disorder to other systems near their SIT is
discussed.

and in space, to directly image tidally heated exomoons orbiting gas-giant
exoplanets. Tidally heated exomoons can plausibly be far more luminous than
their host exoplanet and as much as 0.1% as bright as the system's stellar
primary if it is a low mass star. Because emission from exomoons can be powered
by tidal forces, they can shine brightly at arbitrarily large separations from
the system's stellar primary with temperatures of several hundreds degrees
Kelvin or even higher in extreme cases. Furthermore, these high temperatures
can occur in systems that are billions of years old. Tidally heated exomoons
may thus be far easier targets for direct imaging studies than giant exoplanets
which must be both young and at a large projected separation from their primary
to be accessible to current generation direct imaging studies. For example, the
(warm) Spitzer Space Telescope and the next generation of ground based
instruments could detect an exomoon roughly the size of the Earth at a
temperature ~600K and a distance ~5 parsecs. Future mid-infrared space
telescopes, such as JWST and SPICA, will be capable of directly imaging tidally
heated exomoons around the nearest two dozen stars with brightness temperature
>300K and R>1R_earth orbiting at >12AU from the primary star at a 5sigma
confidence level in a 10,000 second integration. In addition it is possible
that some of the exoplanets which have already been directly imaged are
actually tidally heated exomoons or blends of such objects with hot young
planets. If such exomoons exist and are sufficiently common (i.e. nearby), it
may well be far easier to directly image an exomoon with surface conditions
that allow the existence of liquid water than it will be to resolve an
Earth-like planet in the classical Habitable Zone of its primary.

variations caused by pose changes, especially without any training samples. In
this paper, we present an unsupervised algorithm for identifying frontal view
among multiple facial images under various yaw poses (derived from the same
person). Our approach is based on Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), with the
assumption that with yaw pose being the only variable, the facial images should
lie in a smooth and low dimensional manifold. We horizontally flip the facial
images and present two K-nearest neighbor protocols for the original images and
the flipped images, respectively. In the proposed extended LLE, for any facial
image (original or flipped one), we search (1) the Ko nearest neighbors among
the original facial images and (2) the Kf nearest neighbors among the flipped
facial images to construct the same neighborhood graph. The extended LLE
eliminates the differences (because of background, face position and scale in
the whole image and some asymmetry of left-right face) between the original
facial image and the flipped facial image at the same yaw pose so that the
flipped facial images can be used effectively. Our approach does not need any
training samples as prior information. The experimental results show that the
frontal view of head can be identified reliably around the lowest point of the
pose manifold for multiple facial images, especially the cropped facial images
(little background and centered face).

metabolic cycle in a primitive cell. The cycle is sustained by the molecular
recognition. If an original cell acquires the ability of the replication of
oligomers, the relationship among oligomers changes due to the poor fidelity of
the replication. This change leads to the diversification of metabolic cycles.
The selection among diverse cycles is the basis of the evolution. The
evolvability is one of the essential characters of life. We demonstrate the

best candidate of central engine of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Recent rich
observations of GRBs by space missions such as Swift and Fermi pose new
constraints on GRB central engine models. In this paper, we study the baryon
loading processes of a GRB jet launched from a black hole central engine. We
consider a relativistic jet powered by $\nu \bar\nu$-annihilation or by the
Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. We consider baryon loading from a
neutrino-driven wind from a neutrino-cooling-dominated accretion flow. For a
magnetically dominated BZ jet, we consider neutron-drifting from the magnetic
wall surrounding the jet and subsequent positron capture and proton-neutron
inelastic collisions. The minumim baryon loads in both types of jet are
calculated. We find that in both cases, a more luminous jet tends to be more
baryon poor. A neutrino-driven ""fireball"" is typically ""dirtier"" than a
magnetically dominated jet, while a magnetically dominated jet can be much
cleaner. Both models have the right scaling to interpret the empirical
$\Gamma-L_{\rm iso}$ relation discovered recently. Since some neutrino-driven
jets have too much baryon loading as compared with the data, we suggest that at
least a good fraction of GRBs should have a magnetically dominated central
engine.

  This shows that, in each region squeezed between two levels of the Bernoulli
function, besides the energy dissipation due to the enstrophy, the energy flows
into the region through the level hypersurface having the higher level, and the
energy flows out of the region through the level hypersurface with the lower

processing and error analysis for satellite gravimetry missions. But both the
approaches, which are based on least-squares collocation, address the whole
effect of measurement errors and estimate the resolution of gravity field
models mainly from a numerical point of indirect view. Moreover, requirement
for higher accuracy and resolution gravity field models could make the
computation more difficult, and serious numerical instabilities arise. In order
to overcome the problems, this study focuses on constructing a direct
relationship between power spectral density of the satellite gravimetry
measurements and coefficients of the Earth's gravity potential. Based on
two-dimensional Fourier transform, the relationship is analytically concluded.
By taking advantage of the analytical expression, it is efficient and distinct
for parameter estimation and error analysis of missions. From the relationship
and the simulations, it is analytically confirmed that the low-frequency noise
affects the gravity field recovery in all degrees for the instance of satellite
gradiometer recovery mission. Furthermore, some other results and suggestions
are also described.

sizes on the milliarcsecond scale and no detectable companions. While systems
of calibrators have been generally established for the near-infrared in the
bright source regime (K$\la 3$\,mag), modern large interferometers are
sensitive to significantly fainter magnitudes. We aim at providing a list of
sources found unresolved from direct observations with high angular resolution
and dynamic range, which can be used to choose interferometric calibrators. To
this purpose, we have used a large number of lunar occultations recorded with
the ISAAC instrument at the VLT to select sources found to be unresolved and
without close companions. An algorithm has been used to determine the limiting
angular resolution achieved for each source, taking into account a noise model
built from occulted and unocculted portions of the light curves. We have
obtained upper limits on the angular sizes of 556 sources, with magnitudes
ranging from K$_{\rm s} \approx$4 to 10, with a median of 7.2\,mag. The upper
limits on possible undetected companions (within $\approx 0\farcs5$) range from
K$_{\rm s} \approx$8 to 13, with a median of 11.5\,mag. One-third of the
sources have angular sizes $\le 1$, and two-thirds $\le 2$ milliarcseconds.
This list of unresolved sources matches well the capabilities of current large
interferometric facilities. We also provide available cross-identifications,
magnitudes, spectral types, and other auxiliary information. A fraction of the
sources are found to be potentially variable. The list covers parts of the
Galactic Bulge and in particular the vicinity of the Galactic Center, where
extinction is very significant and traditional lists of calibrators are often
insufficient.

single-degenerate (SD) scenario, the interaction between the SN blast wave and
the outer layers of a main sequence (MS) companion star strips off H-rich
material which is then mixed into the ejecta. Strong contamination of the SN
ejecta with stripped material could lead to a conflict with observations of SNe
Ia. This constrains the SD progenitor model. In this work, our previous
simulations based on simplified progenitor donor stars have been updated by
adopting more realistic progenitor-system models that result from fully
detailed, state-of-the-art binary evolution calculations. We use Eggleton's
stellar evolution code including the optically thick accretion wind model and
the possibility of the effects of accretion disk instabilities to obtain
realistic models of companions for different progenitor systems. The impact of
the SN blast wave on these companion stars is followed in three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulations employing the SPH code GADGET3. We find that the
stripped masses range from 0.11 to 0.18 M_sun. The kick velocity is between 51
and 105 km/s. We find that the stripped mass and kick velocity depend on the
ratio of the orbital separation to the radius of a companion. They can be
fitted by a power law for a given companion model. However, the structure of
the companion star is also important for the amount of stripped material. With
more realistic companion star models than in previous studies, our simulations
show that the H masses stripped from companions are inconsistent with the best
observational limits (< 0.01 M_sun) derived from nebular spectra. However, a
rigorous forward modeling based on impact simulations with radiation transfer
is required to reliably predict observable signatures of the stripped H and to
conclusively assess the viability of the considered SN Ia progenitor scenario.

about their origin and evolution. In particular, the relationship between the
mass distribution of these clumps (also known as the ""clump mass function"", or
CMF) and the stellar initial mass function (IMF), is still poorly understood.
In order to discern the ""true"" shape of the CMF and to better understand how
the CMF may evolve toward the IMF, large samples of bona-fide pre- and
proto-stellar clumps are required. The sensitive observations of the Herschel
Space Observatory (HSO) are now allowing us to look at large clump populations
in various clouds with different physical conditions. We analyse two fields in
the Galactic plane mapped by HSO during its science demonstration phase, as
part of the more complete and unbiased Herschel infrared GALactic Plane Survey
(Hi-GAL). These fields undergo a source-extraction and flux-estimation
pipeline, which allows us to obtain a sample with thousands of clumps. Starless
and proto-stellar clumps are separated using both color and positional criteria
to find those coincident with MIPS 24 micron sources. We describe the
probability density functions of the power-law and lognormal models that are
used to fit the CMFs, and we then find their best-fit parameters. For the
lognormal model we apply several statistical techniques to the data and compare
their results. The CMFs of the two SDP fields show very similar shapes, but
very different mass scales. This similarity is confirmed by the values of the
best-fit parameters of either the power-law or lognormal model. The power-law
model leads to almost identical CMF slopes, whereas the lognormal model shows
that the CMFs have similar widths. The similar CMF shape but different mass
scale represents an evidence that the overall process of star formation in the
two regions is very different.

geostationary satellites. As we use a dark fiber there are practically no
limitations to the bandwidth of the transmitted signals so that we can use the

commercial equipment. This leads to an enhanced precision compared to satellite
time transfer where the occupied bandwidth is limited for cost reasons. The
TTTOF system has been characterized and calibrated in a common clock experiment

good quantitative agreement between experiment and theoretical modeling based

that the absorption of microwave signals in an extremely narrow frequency band
(\Delta\omega/2\pi <5 Hz) around the cavity resonance of about 6 GHz can be
adjusted over a range of more than 25 dB on varying the drive tone power by a
factor of two. Possible applications of this phenomenon include notch filters
to cut out extremely narrow frequency bands (< Hz) of a much broader band of
the order of MHz defined by the resonance width of the microwave cavity. The
amount of absorption as well as the filtered frequency is tunable over the full
width of the microwave resonance by adjusting the power and frequency of the
drive field. At high drive power we observe parametric microwave amplification
with the nanomechanical resonator. Due to the very low loss rate of the
nanomechanical beam the drive power range for parametric amplification is
narrow, since the beam rapidly starts to perform self-oscillations.

assumed to be a rigid bead making a fixed trajectory under periodically varying
driving force. By a linear analysis, we derive the necessary and sufficient
conditions for a pair of rotors to synchronize in phase. We also derive a
non-linear evolution equation for their phase difference, which is reduced to
minimization of an effective potential. The effective potential is calculated
for a variety of trajectory shapes and geometries (either bulk or substrated),
for which the stable and metastable states of the system are identified. Finite
size of the trajectory induces asymmetry of the potential, which also depends
sensitively on the tilt of the trajectory. Our results show that flexibility of

compresses what it gets using Wyner-Ziv compression and conveys it to the

use the relaxation method to find the bound states and the Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
method to obtain the scattering wavefunctions of the fermion in the whole
interval of $x$. The resulting phase shifts are consistent with the weak and
strong forms of the Levinson theorem. Then, we compute and plot the Casimir
energy as a function of the parameters of the pseudoscalar field, i.e. the
slope of $\phi(x)$ at x=0 ($\mu$) and the value of $\phi(x)$ at infinity
($\theta_0$). In the graph of the Casimir energy as a function of $\mu$ there
is a sharp maximum occurring when the fermion bound state energy crosses the
line of E=0. Furthermore, this graph shows that the Casimir energy goes to zero
for $\mu\rightarrow 0$, and also for $\mu\rightarrow \infty$ when $\theta_0$ is
an integer multiple of $\pi$. Moreover, the graph of the Casimir energy as a
function of $\theta_0$ shows that this energy is on the average an increasing
function of $\theta_0$ and has a cusp whenever there is a zero fermionic mode.
We finally compute the total energy of a system consisting of a valence fermion
in the ground state. Most importantly, we show that this energy (the sum of the
Casimir energy and the energy of the fermion) is minimum when the background
field has winding number one, independent of the details of the background

gravitational wave signature, produced by multiple harmonics sourced by their
strong local gravitational field and further modulated by the orbital plane's
precession. Some features of this complex signal are easily accessible to
ground-based interferometers (e.g., the rate of change of frequency); others
less so (e.g., the polarization content); and others unavailable (e.g.,
features of the signal out of band). For this reason, an ambiguity function (a
diagnostic of dissimilarity) between two such signals varies on many parameter
scales and ranges. In this paper, we present a method for computing an
approximate, effective Fisher matrix from variations in the ambiguity function
on physically pertinent scales which depend on the relevant signal to noise
ratio. As a concrete example, we explore how higher harmonics improve parameter
measurement accuracy. As previous studies suggest, for our fiducial BH-NS
binaries and for plausible signal amplitudes, we see that higher harmonics at
best marginally improve our ability to measure parameters. For non-precessing
binaries, these Fisher matrices separate into intrinsic (mass, spin) and
extrinsic (geometrical) parameters; higher harmonics principally improve our
knowledge about the line of sight. For the precessing binaries, the extra
information provided by higher harmonics is distributed across several
parameters. We provide concrete estimates for measurement accuracy, using
coordinates adapted to the precession cone in the detector's sensitive band.

cross-validated bandwidth selectors improve significantly from indirectness.
Indirect crossvalidation first estimates the classical cross-validated
bandwidth from a more rough and difficult smoothing problem than the original
one and then rescales this indirect bandwidth to become a bandwidth of the
original problem. The motivation for this approach comes from the observation
that classical crossvalidation tends to work better when the smoothing problem
is difficult. In this paper we find that the performance of indirect
crossvalidation improves theoretically and practically when the polynomial
order of the indirect kernel increases, with the Gaussian kernel as limiting
kernel when the polynomial order goes to infinity. These theoretical and
practical results support the often proposed choice of the Gaussian kernel as
indirect kernel. However, for do-validation our study shows a discrepancy
between asymptotic theory and practical performance. As for indirect
crossvalidation, in asymptotic theory the performance of indirect do-validation
improves with increasing polynomial order of the used indirect kernel. But this
theoretical improvements do not carry over to practice and the original
do-validation still seems to be our preferred bandwidth selector. We also
consider plug-in estimation and combinations of plug-in bandwidths and
crossvalidated bandwidths. These latter bandwidths do not outperform the
original do-validation estimator either.

stellar winds, which collide with the circumstellar medium. Because the
characteristics of these stellar winds vary over the course of the evolution of
the star, the circumstellar matter becomes a reflection of the stellar
evolution and can be used to determine the characteristics of the progenitor
star. In particular, whenever a fast wind phase follows a slow wind phase, the
fast wind sweeps up its predecessor in a shell, which is observed as a
circumstellar nebula. We make 2-D and 3-D numerical simulations of fast stellar
winds sweeping up their slow predecessors to investigate whether numerical
models of these shells have to be 3-D, or whether 2-D models are sufficient to
reproduce the shells correctly. We focus on those situations where a fast
Wolf-Rayet (WR) star wind sweeps up the slower wind emitted by its predecessor,
being either a red supergiant or a luminous blue variable. As the fast WR wind
expands, it creates a dense shell of swept up material that expands outward,
driven by the high pressure of the shocked WR wind. These shells are subject to
a fair variety of hydrodynamic-radiative instabilities. If the WR wind is
expanding into the wind of a luminous blue variable phase, the instabilities
will tend to form a fairly small-scale, regular filamentary lattice with thin
filaments connecting knotty features. If the WR wind is sweeping up a red
supergiant wind, the instabilities will form larger interconnected structures
with less regularity. Our results show that 3-D models, when translated to
observed morphologies, give realistic results that can be compared directly to
observations. The 3-D structure of the nebula will help to distinguish
different progenitor scenarios.

the orbital dynamics, if the barycenter of the binary is moving relative to the

PFEs for strongly self-gravitating bodies. We derive a limit |alpha_2| < 1.8e-4

scheme for enabling large-scale electronic calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT) on massively parallel computers. It is composed of two
methods: (i) atom decomposition method and (ii) grid decomposition method. In
the former, we develop a modified recursive bisection method based on inertia
tensor moment to reorder the atoms along a principal axis so that atoms that
are close in real space are also close on the axis to ensure data locality. The
atoms are then divided into sub-domains depending on their projections onto the
principal axis in a balanced way among the processes. In the latter, we define
four data structures for the partitioning of grids that are carefully
constructed to make data locality consistent with that of the clustered atoms
for minimizing data communications between the processes. We also propose a
decomposition method for solving the Poisson equation using three-dimensional
FFT in Hartree potential calculation, which is shown to be better than a
previously proposed parallelization method based on a two-dimensional
decomposition in terms of communication efficiency. For evaluation, we perform
benchmark calculations with our open-source DFT code, OpenMX, paying particular
attention to the O(N) Krylov subspace method. The results show that our scheme
exhibits good strong and weak scaling properties, with the parallel efficiency
at 131,072 cores being 67.7% compared to the baseline of 16,384 cores with

multiplication of real-valued matrices building upon work for detecting the
most frequent items in data streams. We continue this line of research and
present new {\em deterministic} matrix multiplication algorithms.
  Motivated by applications in data mining, we first consider the case of
real-valued, nonnegative $n$-by-$n$ input matrices $A$ and $B$, and show how to
obtain a deterministic approximation of the weights of individual entries, as
well as the entrywise $p$-norm, of the product $AB$. The algorithm is simple,
space efficient and runs in one pass over the input matrices. For a user
defined $b \in (0, n^2)$ the algorithm runs in time $O(nb +
n\cdot\text{Sort}(n))$ and space $O(n + b)$ and returns an approximation of the
entries of $AB$ within an additive factor of $\|AB\|_{E1}/b$, where $\|C\|_{E1}
= \sum_{i, j} |C_{ij}|$ is the entrywise 1-norm of a matrix $C$ and
$\text{Sort}(n)$ is the time required to sort $n$ real numbers in linear space.
Building upon a result by Berinde et al. we show that for skewed matrix
products (a common situation in many real-life applications) the algorithm is
more efficient and achieves better approximation guarantees than previously
known randomized algorithms.
  When the input matrices are not restricted to nonnegative entries, we present
a new deterministic group testing algorithm detecting nonzero entries in the
matrix product with large absolute value. The algorithm is clearly outperformed
by randomized matrix multiplication algorithms, but as a byproduct we obtain
the first $O(n^{2 + \varepsilon})$-time deterministic algorithm for matrix

function of time, which enhances its elasticity and relaxation time. In this
work we employ effective time approach to investigate long term relaxation
dynamics by carrying out creep experiments. Typically we observe that the
monotonic evolution of elastic modulus shifts to lower aging times while maxima
in viscous modulus gets progressively broader for experiments carried out on a
later date since preparation (idle time) of nanoclay suspension. Application of
effective time theory produces superposition of all the creep curves
irrespective of their initial state. The resulting dependence of relaxation
time on aging time shows very strong hyper aging dynamics at small idle times,
which progressively weakens to demonstrate linear dependence in the limit of
very large idle times. Remarkably this behavior of nanoclay suspension is akin
to that observed for polymeric glasses. Consideration of aging as a first order
process suggests that continued hyper-aging dynamics causes cessation of aging.
The dependence of relaxation time on aging time, therefore, must attenuate
eventually producing linear or weaker dependence on time in order to approach
progressively low energy state in the limit of very large times as observed
experimentally. We also develop a simple scaling model based on a concept of
aging of an energy well, which qualitatively captures various experimental
observations very well leading to profound insight into the hyper-aging
dynamics of nano-clay suspensions.

rotational shear flow by applying torque and elongational flow by applying
normal force. The generic behavior under the combined fields is investigated in
different soft glassy materials with diverse microstructure such as: hair gel,
emulsion paint, shaving foam and clay suspension. Increase in strength of one
stress component while keeping the other constant, not only leads to an
expected enhanced deformation in its own direction, but also greater strain in
the other direction. Herschel Bulkley model is observed to explain this
behavior qualitatively. Elongational flow induced in the materials eventually
causes failure in the same. Interestingly time to failure is observed to be
strongly dependent not just on normal force but also on the applied rotational
shear stress. We believe that the presence of a three dimensional jammed
structure, in which overall unjamming can be induced by applying stress having
sufficient magnitude irrespective of the direction leads to the observed
behavior. In addition, we observe self-similarity in the elongational as well
as rotational strain time curves corresponding to various combinations of both
the fields. This observation suggests a mere shift in the time-scales involved
keeping the path followed in the process unchanged. A phase diagram is also
constructed for various soft glassy materials by determining different
combinations of orthogonal stresses beyond which materials yield. Estimated
yield stress in the limit of flow dominated by applied tensile force on the top
plate demonstrates scatter, which might be originating from fingering

generations of stars of which the first generation (1G), and therefore also the
protocluster cloud, has been much more massive than the currently predominating
second generation (2G). Fast gas expulsion is thought to unbind the majority of
the 1G stars. Gas expulsion is also mandatory to remove metal-enriched
supernova ejecta, which are not found in the 2G stars. It has long been thought
that the supernovae themselves are the agent of the gas expulsion, based on
crude energetics arguments. Here, we assume that gas expulsion happens via the
formation of a superbubble, and describe the kinematics by a thin-shell model.
We find that supernova- driven shells are destroyed by the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability before they reach escape speed for all but perhaps the least
massive and most extended clusters. More power is required to expel the gas,
which might plausibly be provided by a coherent onset of accretion onto the
stellar remnants. The resulting kpc-sized bubbles might be observable in

flow invariance of rectangular subsets under systems of stochastic differential
equations. We formulate explicit necessary and sufficient conditions, that are
valid for both, It\^o's and Stratonovich's interpretation of stochastic
differential equations, improving a previous result obtained by A. Milian
[A.Milian, Coll. Math. 1995] in the It\^o case. These invariance criteria allow
to validate stochastic models in many applications. To illustrate our results
we present numerical simulations for a stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley model.

compact star merger models. In the framework of the black hole-neutron star

the disk and the magnetic barrier around the black hole for the activity of
SGRB central engines. We show that the radial angular momentum transfer may
significantly prolong the lifetime of the accretion process and multiple
episodes may be switched by the magnetic barrier. Our numerical calculations
based on the models of the neutrino-dominated accretion flows suggest that the
disk mass is critical for producing the observed EE. In case of the mass being
$\sim 0.8M_{\odot}$, our model can reproduce the observed timescale and
luminosity of both the main and EE episodes in a reasonable parameter set. The
predicted luminosity of the EE component is lower than the observed EE with
about one order of magnitude and the timescale is shorter than 20 seconds if
the disk mass being $\sim 0.2M_{\odot}$. {\em Swift}/BAT-like instruments may
be not sensitive enough to detect the EE component in this case. We argue that
the EE component would be a probe for merger process and disk formation for
compact star mergers.

nuclei are triggered involves the existence of a supermassive binary black hole
system in their cores. Here we present an observational evidence for the first
spectroscopically resolved sub-parsec orbit of a such system in the core of
Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151. Using a method similar to those typically applied for
spectroscopic binary stars we obtained radial velocity curves of the
supermassive binary system, from which we calculated orbital elements and made
estimates about the masses of components. Our analysis shows that periodic
variations in the light and radial velocity curves can be accounted for an
eccentric, sub-parsec Keplerian orbit of a 15.9-year period. The flux maximum
in the lightcurve correspond to the approaching phase of a secondary component
towards the observer. According to the obtained results we speculate that the
periodic variations in the observed H{\alpha} line shape and flux are due to
shock waves generated by the supersonic motion of the components through the
surrounding medium. Given the large observational effort needed to reveal this
spectroscopically resolved binary orbital motion we suggest that many such
systems may exist in similar objects even if they are hard to find. Detecting
more of them will provide us with insight into black hole mass growth process.

The [CII] line is widely used as a tracer of star formation in the Milky Way

via collisions with hydrogen molecules, atoms, and electrons. Velocity-resolved
observations of [CII] have become possible with the HIFI instrument on Herschel

transition of the [CII] line, deriving analytic results for several limiting
cases and carry out numerical solutions using a large velocity gradient model
for a more inclusive analysis. We show that for antenna temperatures up to 1/3
of the brightness temperature of the gas kinetic temperature, the antenna
temperature is linearly proportional to the column density of C+ irrespective
of the optical depth of the transition, which can be referred to as the
effectively optically thin (EOT) approximation. We review the critical
densities for excitation of the [CII] line by various collision partners. We
briefly analyze C+ absorption and conclude with a discussion of C+ cooling and

the mean-field plane rotator (or classical spin XY) measure. It is well known
that this model exhibits a phase transition at a critical value of the
interaction strength parameter K, in the limit of the number N of rotators
going to infinity. A Fokker-Planck PDE captures the evolution of the empirical
measure of the system as N goes to infinity, at least for finite times and when
the empirical measure of the system at time zero satisfies a law of large
numbers. The phase transition is reflected in the fact that the PDE for K above
the critical value has a stable manifold of stationary solutions, that are
equivalent up to rotations. These stationary solutions are actually unimodal
densities parametrized by the position of their maximum (the synchronization
phase or center). We characterize the dynamics on times of order N and we show
substantial deviations from the behavior of the solutions of the PDE. In fact,
if the empirical measure at time zero converges as N goes to infinity to a
probability measure (which is away from a thin set that we characterize) and if
time is speeded up by N, the empirical measure reaches almost instantaneously a
small neighborhood of the stable manifold, to which it then sticks and on which
a non-trivial random dynamics takes place. In fact the synchronization center
performs a Brownian motion with a diffusion coefficient that we compute. Our
approach therefore provides, for one of the basic statistical mechanics systems
with continuum symmetry, a detailed characterization of the macroscopic
deviations from the large scale limit -- or law of large numbers -- due to
finite size effects. But the interest for this model goes beyond statistical
mechanics, since it plays a central role in a variety of scientific domains in
which one aims at understanding synchronization phenomena.

stably finite C*-algebra has a bounded quasitrace. Rather strong
generalizations of stable finiteness to the non-unital case can be obtained by
either requiring the multiplier algebra to be stably finite, or alternatively
requiring it to be at least stably not properly infinite. This paper deals with
the question whether the Blackadar-Handelman result can be extended to the
non-unital case with respect to these generalizations of stable finiteness.
  For suitably well-behaved C*-algebras there is a positive result, but none of
the non-unital versions holds in full generality. Two examples of C*-algebras
are constructed. The first one is a non-unital, stably commutative C*-algebra
$A$ that contradicts the weakest possible generalization of the
Blackadar-Handelman theorem: The multiplier algebras of all matrix algebras
over $A$ are finite, while $A$ has no bounded quasitrace. The second example is
a non-unital, simple C*-algebra $B$ that is stably non-stable, i.e. no matrix
algebra over $B$ is a stable C*-algebra. In fact, the multiplier algebras over
all matrix algebras of this C*-algebra are not properly infinite. Moreover, the
C*-algebra $B$ has no bounded quasitrace and therefore gives a simple
counterexample to a possible generalization of the Blackadar-Handelman theorem.

when two of the atoms are about to form a two-body s-wave dimer, there exists
an infinite number of three-body bound states. This effect is the well-known
Efimov effect. These three-body states (Efimov states) are found to be
universal for ultracold atomic gases and the lowest Efimov state crosses the
three-body break-up threshold when the s-wave two-body scattering length is $a
\approx -9.73 r_{\rm vdW}$, $r_{\rm vdW}$ being the van der Waals length. This
article focuses on a generalized version of this Efimov scenario, where two of
the atoms are about to form a two-body d-wave dimer, which leads to strong
d-wave interactions. In a recent paper [B. Gao, Phys. Rev. A. {\bf 62},
050702(R) (2000)], Bo Gao has predicted that for broad resonances the d-wave
dimer is always formed near $a \approx 0.956 r_{\rm vdW}$. Here we find that a
single universal three-body state associated with the d-wave dimer is also
formed near the three-body break-up threshold at $a \approx 1.09 r_{\rm vdW}$
and its signature can be found through enhancement of the three-body
recombination. The three-body effective potential curves that are crucial for
understanding the recombination dynamics are also calculated and analyzed. An
improved method to calculate the couplings, effective potential curves, and
recombination rate coefficients is presented.

neutron matter is performed. The leading-order terms arising from pion-exchange
in combination with the chiral $4\pi$-vertex and the chiral NN$3\pi$-vertex are
found to be very small. Their attractive contribution to the energy per
particle stays below $0.6\,$MeV in magnitude for densities up to $\rho
=0.4\,$fm$^{-3}$. We consider also the four-nucleon interaction induced by
pion-exchange and twofold $\Delta$-isobar excitation of nucleons. For most of
the closed four-loop diagrams the occurring integrals over four Fermi spheres
can either be solved analytically or reduced to easily manageable one- or
two-parameter integrals. After summing the individually large contributions
from 3-ring, 2-ring and 1-ring diagrams of alternating signs, one obtains at
nuclear matter saturation density $\rho_0=0.16\,$fm$^{-3}$ a moderate
contribution of $2.35\,$MeV to the energy per particle. The curve $\bar
E(\rho)$ rises rapidly with density, approximately with the third power of
$\rho$. In pure neutron matter the analogous chiral four-body interactions
lead, at the same density $\rho_n$, to a repulsive contribution that is about
half as strong. The present calculation indicates that long-range multi-nucleon
forces, in particular those provided by the strongly coupled $\pi N
\Delta$-system with its small mass-gap of $293\,$MeV, can still play an
appreciable role for the equation of state of nuclear and neutron matter.

signature in the Earth limb photons, which provide a smooth reference spectrum
for null tests. We find no significant 130 GeV feature in the Earth limb
sample. However, we do find a marginally significant 130 GeV feature in Earth
limb photons with a limited range of detector incidence angles. This raises
concerns about the 130 GeV Galactic center feature, even though we can think of
no plausible model of instrumental behavior that connects the two. A modest
amount of additional limb data would tell us if the limb feature is a
statistical fluke. If the limb feature persists, it would raise doubts about
the Pass 7 processing of E > 100 GeV events. At present we find no instrumental
systematics that could plausibly explain the excess Galactic center emission at
130 GeV.

obtain the radial, azimuthal and precession frequencies of the massive
particles in the flow of perfect fluid. We next consider the massive particles
in the stable circular orbit of radius of $1.0~ly$ around the supernovas SN
1979C, SN 1987A and SN 2213-1745 in the Kerr curved spacetime, and around the
potential supermassive Schwarzschild black holes M87, NGC 3115, NGC 4594, NGC
3377, NGC 4258, M31, M32 and Galatic center, to estimate their radial and

precession motion. The photon unstable orbit is also discussed in terms of the
impact parameter of the photon trajectory. Finally, on the equatorial plane of
the Kerr black hole, we construct the global flat embedding structures
possessing (9+3) dimensionalities outside and inside the event horizon of the
rotating Kerr black hole. Moreover, on the plane we investigate the warp

not be mixed to further reduce the error fraction. Close to the lowest error
limit, kinetic discrimination results in a diverging copying velocity and
dissipation per copied bit. On the opposite, energetic discrimination reaches
its lowest error limit in an adiabatic regime where dissipation and velocity
vanish. By analyzing experimentally measured kinetic rates of two DNA

interatomic potentials for metals and alloys. However, the EAM potentials
impose three constraints on elastic constants that are inconsistent with
experiments. At a more subtle (but more important) level, the EAM potentials
often incorrectly describe the outward/inward relaxation of surface layers, and
therefore will not reliably describe nanostructures. This Letter reports a
response EAM (R-EAM) that addresses both issues. Conceptually, the electron
distribution from each atom does not respond to the atoms environment within
the EAM. In reality, the electron distribution from each atom depends on the
atoms environment, and this dependence is explicitly incorporated in the R-EAM.
Analytical derivation shows that the R-EAM potentials do not impose these three
constraints on elastic constants that EAM potentials do. Further, taking
hexagonal close packed (HCP) metals Ti, Mg, and Zn as the prototypes, the
authors show that the R-EAM potentials correctly describe surfaces, in terms of
interlayer spacing and surface reconstruction, in agreement with quantum
mechanics calculations, while EAM potentials are not in agreement. In
comparison to EAM potentials, the R-EAM potentials require only approximately
twice the computational power.

space of modulated and damped sinusoidal peaks observed in cosmic microwave
background radiation anisotropies. We use the theory of the Fourier transform
to connect localized features of the two-point correlation function in real
space to oscillations in the power spectrum. We also illustrate analytically
and by means of Monte Carlo simulations the angular correlation function for
distributions of filled disks with fixed or variable radii capable of
generating oscillations in the power spectrum. While the power spectrum shows
repeated information in the form of multiple peaks and oscillations, the
angular correlation function offers a more compact presentation that condenses
all the information of the multiple peaks into a localized real space feature.
We have seen that oscillations in the power spectrum arise when there is a
discontinuity in a given derivative of the angular correlation function at a
given angular distance. These kinds of discontinuities do not need to be abrupt
in an infinitesimal range of angular distances but may also be smooth, and can
be generated by simply distributing excesses of antenna temperature in filled
disks of fixed or variable radii on the sky, provided that there is a non-null
minimum radius and/or the maximum radius is constrained.
