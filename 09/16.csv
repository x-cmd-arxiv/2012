  Fully Verifiable Settings",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mechanism design is addressed in the context of fair allocations of
indivisible goods with monetary compensation. Motivated by a real-world social
choice problem, mechanisms with verification are considered in a setting where
(i) agents' declarations on allocated goods can be fully verified before
payments are performed, and where (ii) verification is not used to punish
agents whose declarations resulted in incorrect ones. Within this setting, a
mechanism is designed that is shown to be truthful, efficient, and
budget-balanced, and where agents' utilities are fairly determined by the
Shapley value of suitable coalitional games. The proposed mechanism is however
shown to be #P-complete. Thus, to deal with applications with many agents
involved, two polynomial-time randomized variants are also proposed: one that
is still truthful and efficient, and which is approximately budget-balanced
with high probability, and another one that is truthful in expectation, while
still budget-balanced and efficient.

computing an optimal solution is an NP-hard problem in general; yet, when
restricted over classes of instances whose constraint interactions can be

located in Canis Major OB1 complex. Optical spectroscopic observations are used
to constrain the spectral type of ionizing star HD 53623 as B0V. The classical
nature of this H II region is affirmed by the low values of electron density
and emission measure, which are calculated to be 756 cm^-3 and 9.15 x 10^5
cm^-6 pc using the radio continuum observations at 610 and 1280 MHz, and VLA
archival data at 1420 MHz. To understand local star formation, we identified
the young stellar object (YSO) candidates in a region of area ~ 7.5' x 7.5'
centered on Sh2-297 using grism slitless spectroscopy (to identify the Halpha
emission line stars), and near infrared (NIR) observations. NIR YSO candidates
are further classified into various evolutionary stages using color-color (CC)
and color-magnitude (CM) diagrams, giving 50 red sources (H-K > 0.6) and 26
Class II-like sources. The mass and age range of the YSOs are estimated to be ~
0.1 - 2 Msolar and 0.5 - 2 Myr using optical (V/V-I) and NIR (J/J-H) CM
diagrams. The mean age of the YSOs is found to be ~ 1 Myr, which is of the
order of dynamical age of 1.07 Myr of the H II region. Using the estimated
range of visual extinction (1.1 - 25 mag) from literature and NIR data for the
region, spectral energy distribution (SED) models have been implemented for
selected YSOs which show masses and ages to be consistent with estimated
values. The spatial distribution of YSOs shows an evolutionary sequence,
suggesting triggered star formation in the region. The star formation seems to
have propagated from the ionizing star towards the cold dark cloud LDN1657A
located west of Sh2-297.

dilaton effective action for RG flows in d dimensions. When d is even, the
action consists of a Wess-Zumino (WZ) term, whose Weyl-variation encodes the
trace-anomaly, plus all Weyl-invariants. For d odd, the action consists of
Weyl-invariants only. We present explicit results for the flat-space limit of
the dilaton effective action in d-dimensions up to and including 8-derivative
terms. GJMS-operators from conformal geometry motivate a form of the action
that unifies the Weyl-invariants and anomaly-terms into a compact general-d
structure.
  A new feature in 8d is the presence of an 8-derivative Weyl-invariant that
pollutes the O(p^8)-contribution from the WZ action to the dilaton scattering
amplitudes; this may challenge a dilaton-based proof of an a-theorem in 8d.
  We use the example of a free massive scalar for two purposes: 1) it allows us
to confirm the structure of the d-dimensional dilaton effective action
explicitly; we carry out this check for d=3,4,5,...,10; and 2) in 8d we
demonstrate how the flow (a_UV - a_IR) can be extracted systematically from the
O(p^8)-amplitudes despite the contamination from the 8-derivative
Weyl-invariant. This computation gives a value for the a-anomaly of the 8d free
conformal scalar that is shown to match the value obtained from zeta-function
regularization of the log-term in the free energy.

ATLAS, CMS and LHCb. The experimental branching fraction upper limits for the
B0_s -> mu+mu- are already quite close to the branching fraction predicted by
the Standard Model, and the first observation of the B0_s -> mu+mu- decay is
expected soon. The rare decays B0_(s) -> mu+mu- are highly suppressed in the
Standard Model, and therefore accurate measurements of these branching
fractions provide complementary constraints to the free parameters of various

  Special Issue on Bayesian Nonparametrics. 14 pages, 4 figures",,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The seemingly disjoint problems of count and mixture modeling are united
under the negative binomial (NB) process. A gamma process is employed to model
the rate measure of a Poisson process, whose normalization provides a random
probability measure for mixture modeling and whose marginalization leads to an
NB process for count modeling. A draw from the NB process consists of a Poisson
distributed finite number of distinct atoms, each of which is associated with a
logarithmic distributed number of data samples. We reveal relationships between
various count- and mixture-modeling distributions and construct a
Poisson-logarithmic bivariate distribution that connects the NB and Chinese
restaurant table distributions. Fundamental properties of the models are
developed, and we derive efficient Bayesian inference. It is shown that with
augmentation and normalization, the NB process and gamma-NB process can be
reduced to the Dirichlet process and hierarchical Dirichlet process,
respectively. These relationships highlight theoretical, structural and
computational advantages of the NB process. A variety of NB processes,
including the beta-geometric, beta-NB, marked-beta-NB, marked-gamma-NB and
zero-inflated-NB processes, with distinct sharing mechanisms, are also
constructed. These models are applied to topic modeling, with connections made
to existing algorithms under Poisson factor analysis. Example results show the
importance of inferring both the NB dispersion and probability parameters.

  mechanics","7 pages, 2 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Excited state decay is examined within the framework of strictly Everett-like
(SEL) formulations of quantum mechanics. Even though these formulations were
developed for systems of particles as part of a larger system that includes a
measurement apparatus, the analysis is carried out in terms of isolated
particles because excited state decay measurements are performed under
conditions that approximate isolation. It is shown that the time evolution of
the wave function describing each particle in a sample of well-isolated
identical particles in their lowest excited state must satisfy the same branch
topology for all strictly SEL formulations. This topology describes a countably
infinite sequence of random branching events that occur at a rate lambda_B for
each particle in the sample. Two more parameters are required: lambda_A, the
expectation value of the excited-state decay rate determined by an observer
state measuring the lifetime of the particles, and epsilon, the probability
that an observer state that branches off an observer state associated with the
excited state is associated with the excited state following the branching
event. There does not appear to be any way to determine the value of epsilon
within the framework of SEL formulations. Therefore, contrary to Everett's
goal, SEL interpretations do not provide a complete description of every
system. However, it is possible to show that lambda_A = (1-epsilon) lambda_B,
which with the agreement between theoretical and experimental lifetime
determinations provides a conservative upper limit of 0.1% for epsilon at the
current state of the art. This result is very different from the example of a
superposition of states originally considered by Everett wherein the
probability of each final state is given by the conventional Born's rule and no
new parameters are required.

three distinct regimes of characteristic critical behavior can be discerned

state created by photo-excitation, a state characterized by spin disordered
metallic droplets within the larger charge- and spin-ordered insulating

the collapse of spin ordering is correlated with the insulator-to-metal

elements (TEs) in genomes has been of interest to evolutionary biologists for
many years. To describe TE dynamics in populations, many previous studies have
used models of transposition-selection equilibrium that rely on the assumption
of a constant rate of transposition. However, since TE invasions are known to
happen in bursts through time, this assumption may not be reasonable in natural
populations. Here we propose a test of neutrality for TE insertions that does
not rely on the assumption of a constant transposition rate. We consider the
case of TE insertions that have been ascertained from a single haploid
reference genome sequence and have subsequently had their allele frequency
estimated in a population sample. By conditioning on the age of an individual
TE insertion (using information contained in the number of substitutions that
have occurred within the TE sequence since insertion), we determine the
probability distribution for the insertion allele frequency in a population
sample under neutrality. Taking models of varying population size into account,
we then evaluate predictions of our model against allele frequency data from
190 retrotransposon insertions sampled from North American and African
populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Using this non-equilibrium model, we
are able to explain about 80% of the variance in TE insertion allele
frequencies based on age alone. Controlling both for nonequilibrium dynamics of
transposition and host demography, we provide evidence for negative selection
acting against most TEs as well as for positive selection acting on a small
subset of TEs. Our work establishes a new framework for the analysis of the
evolutionary forces governing large insertion mutations like TEs, gene
duplications or other copy number variants.

instantaneous star formation rate (SFR) in a galaxy. While it is in general a
robust indicator of the ongoing star formation activity, the precise value of
the calibration relating the UV luminosity to the SFR ($B_{\nu}$), is sensitive
to various physical properties, such as the recent star formation and metal
enrichment histories, along with the choice of stellar initial mass function.
The distribution of these properties for the star-forming galaxy population
then suggests that the adoption of a single calibration is not appropriate
unless properly qualified with the uncertainties on the calibration. We
investigate, with the aid of the {\sc galform} semi-analytic model of galaxy
formation, the distribution of UV-SFR calibrations obtained using realistic
star formation and metal enrichment histories. At $z=0$, we find that when the
initial mass function is fixed (to the Kennicutt IMF), the median calibration
is $B_{\rm fuv}=0.9$ where ${\rm SFR}/[{\rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}]=B_{\nu}\times
10^{-28}\times L_{\nu}/[{\rm ergs\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}]$. However, the width of
the distribution $B_{\rm fuv}$ suggests that for a single object there is
around a 20% {\em intrinsic} uncertainty (at $z=0$, rising to $\simeq 30%$ at
$z=6$) on the star formation rate inferred from the FUV luminosity without
additional constraints on the star formation history or metallicity. We also
find that the median value of the calibration $B_{\rm fuv}$ is correlated with
the star formation rate and redshift (at $z>3$) raising implications for the

First, the notions of generalized principal Floquet subspaces, generalized
principal Lyapunov exponents, and generalized exponential separations for
general positive random dynamical systems in ordered Banach spaces are
introduced, which extend the classical notions of principal Floquet subspaces,
principal Lyapunov exponents, and exponential separations for strongly positive
deterministic systems in strongly ordered Banach to general positive random
dynamical systems in ordered Banach spaces. Under some quite general
assumptions, it is then shown that a positive random dynamical system in an
ordered Banach space admits a family of generalized principal Floquet
subspaces, a generalized principal Lyapunov exponent, and a generalized
exponential separation. We will consider in the forthcoming parts applications
of the general theory developed in this part to positive random dynamical
systems arising from a variety of random mappings and differential equations,
including random Leslie matrix models, random cooperative systems of ordinary
differential equations, and random parabolic equations.

liquids has been a long-standing scientific problem. Another connected, and not
yet well understood question is the relationship between the glassy and the
various possible crystalline forms a system may adopt. In this context, B2O3 is
a puzzling case of study since i) it is one of the best glass-forming systems
despite an apparent lack of low-pressure polymorphism ii) it vitrifies in a
glassy form abnormally different from the only known crystalline phase at
ambient pressure iii) it never crystallises from the melt unless pressure is
applied, an intriguing behaviour known as the crystallisation anomaly. Here, by
means of ab-initio calculations, we discover the existence of novel B2O3
crystalline polymorphs with structural properties similar to the glass and
formation energies comparable to the known ambient crystal. The resulting
configurational degeneracy drives the system vitrification at ambient pressure.
The degeneracy is lifted under pressure, unveiling the origin of the
crystallisation anomaly. This work reconciles the behaviour of B2O3 with that
from other glassy systems and reaffirms the role played by polymorphism in a
system's ability to vitrify. Some of the predicted crystals are cage-like
materials entirely made of three-fold rings, opening new perspectives for the
synthesis of boron-based nanoporous materials.

high-frequency timing feature detected from neutron star low-mass X-ray
binaries (LMXBs). This feature can be very useful to probe the superdense core
matter of neutron stars, and the strong gravity regime. However, although many
models exist in the literature, the physical origin of kHz QPO is not known,
and hence this feature cannot be used as a tool yet. The energy dependence of
kHz QPO fractional rms amplitude is an important piece of the jigsaw puzzle to
understand the physical origin of this timing feature. It is known that the
fractional rms amplitude increases with energy at lower energies. At higher
energies, the amplitude is usually believed to saturate, although this is not
established. We combine tens of lower kHz QPOs from a neutron star LMXB 4U
1728-34 in order to improve the signal-to-noise-ratio. Consequently, we, for
the first time to the best of our knowledge, find a significant and systematic
decrease of the fractional rms amplitude with energy at higher photon energies.
Assuming an energy spectrum model, blackbody+powerlaw, we explore if the
sinusoidal variation of a single spectral parameter can reproduce the above
mentioned fractional rms amplitude behavior. Our analysis suggests that the
oscillation of any single blackbody parameter is favored over the oscillation
of any single powerlaw parameter, in order to explain the measured amplitude
behavior. We also find that the quality factor of a lower kHz QPO does not
plausibly depend on photon energy.

generally speaking inconsistent results for the thermal conductance: Green Kubo
simulations probe the Landauer conductance between two solids which assumes
phonons on both sides of the interface to be at equilibrium. On the other hand,
we show that NEMD give access to the out-of-equilibrium interfacial conductance
consistent with the interfacial flux describing phonon transport in each solid.
The difference may be large and reaches typically a factor 5 for interfaces
between usual semi-conductors. We analyze finite size effects for the two
determinations of the interfacial thermal conductance, and show that the
equilibrium simulations suffer from severe size effects as compared to NEMD. We
also compare the predictions of the two above mentioned methods -EMD and NEMD-
regarding the interfacial conductance of a series of mass mismatched
Lennard-Jones solids. We show that the Kapitza conductance obtained with EMD
can be well described using the classical diffuse mismatch model (DMM). On the
other hand, NEMD simulations results are consistent with a out-of-equilibrium
generalisation of the acoustic mismatch model (AMM). These considerations are
important in rationalizing previous results obtained using molecular dynamics,
and help in pinpointing the physical scattering mechanisms taking place at
atomically perfect interfaces between solids, which is a prerequesite to
understand interfacial heat transfer across real interfaces.

homogeneous infrastructure or the ability to communicate between nodes. We give
special consideration to the robustness of the framework, minimising the loss
of effort even after total loss of infrastructure, and allowing easy
verification of every step of the distribution process. In contrast to most
eScience applications, the input data and specification of the problem is very
small, being easily given in a paragraph of text. The unique challenges our
framework tackles are related to the combinatorial explosion of the space that
contains the possible solutions and the robustness of long-running
computations. Not only is the time required to finish the computations unknown,
but also the resource requirements may change during the course of the
computation. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework by using it to
solve a challenging and hitherto open problem in computational mathematics. The
results demonstrate that our approach easily scales to computations of a size
that would have been impossible to tackle in practice just a decade ago.

post-processing by trace preserving operations are allowed. We show that the
optimal fidelity is obtained only when part of an appropriate non-maximally
entangled state is transmitted through the channel. The entanglement of this
state can be vanishingly small when the channel becomes very noisy. Moreover,
in the optimal case no further local processing is required to enhance the
fidelity. We further show that local post-processing can enhance fidelity if
and only if the amount of noise is larger than a critical value and
entanglement of the transmitted state is bounded from below. A notable
consequence of these results is that the ordering of states under an
entanglement monotone can be reversed even when the states undergo the same
local interaction via a trace-preserving completely positive map.

strong correlation between the rest-frame \civ\ EW and \civ-based \mbh while
the relation between the \civ\ EW and \mgii-based \mbh is very weak. With the
correction of \civ-based \mbh from the \civ\ blueshift relative to \mgii, we
suggest that this strong correlation is due to the bias of the \civ-based \mbh,

medium strong correlation is found between the \civ\ EW and the Eddington

certain mental tasks after listening to Mozart, and also to its popularized
version that listening to Mozart makes you smarter (Tomatis, 1991; Wikipedia,
2012). Does Mozart effect point to a fundamental cognitive function of music?
Would such an effect of music be due to the hedonicity, a fundamental dimension
of mental experience? The present paper explores a recent hypothesis that music
helps to tolerate cognitive dissonances and thus enabled accumulation of
knowledge and human cultural evolution (Perlovsky, 2010, 2012). We studied
whether the influence of music is related to its hedonicity and whether
pleasant or unpleasant music would influence scholarly test performance and
cognitive dissonance. Specific hypotheses evaluated here are that during a test
students experience contradictory cognitions that cause cognitive dissonances.
If some music helps to tolerate cognitive dissonances, then first, this music
should increase the duration during which participants can tolerate stressful
conditions while evaluating test choices. Second, this should result in
improved performance. These hypotheses are tentatively confirmed in the
reported experiments as the agreeable music was correlated with better
performance above that under indifferent or unpleasant music. It follows that
music likely performs a fundamental cognitive function explaining the origin
and evolution of musical ability considered previously a mystery.
