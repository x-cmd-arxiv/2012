plays a dominate role to produce an strong attraction in this system. Solving
coupled channel Schr\""odinger equations for PN and P* N, we find many bound and
resonant states with isospin I=0 while there are few resonances in I=1 state.
The rich structures with I=0 indicate that the spectrum of heavy baryons near
the threshold is influenced by the contributions from such hadron composite

centers in derived algebraic geometry"", we describe a Morita equivalence for
derived, categorified matrix algebras implied by theory developed since its
appearance. We work in the setting of perfect stacks X and their stable
infinity-categories Q(X) of quasicoherent sheaves. Perfect stacks include all
varieties and common stacks in characteristic zero, and their stable
infinity-categories of sheaves are well behaved refinements of their
quasicoherent derived categories, satisfying natural analogues of common
properties of function spaces.
  To a morphism of perfect stacks pi:X-->Y, we associate the categorified
matrix algebra Q(X x_Y X) of sheaves on the derived fiber product equipped with
its monoidal convolution product. We show that for pi faithfully flat (as a
corollary of the 1-affineness theorem of Gaisgory) or for pi proper and
surjective and X,Y smooth (as an application of proper descent, cf. Gaitsgory
and Preygel), there is a Morita equivalence between Q(X x_Y X) and Q(Y), that
is, an equivalence of their infinity-categories of stable module
infinity-categories. In particular, this immediately implies an identification
of their Drinfeld centers (as previously established in 0805.0157), and more
generally, an identification of their associated topological field theories.
Another consequence is that for an affine algebraic group G in characteristic
zero and an algebraic subgroup K, passing to K-invariants induces an
equivalence from stable infinity-categories with algebraic G-action to modules
for the Hecke category Q(K\G/K).

are charging schemes where charge is moved across vertices of different graphs.
Such methods have been recently applied to obtain various properties of
triangulations that are embedded over a fixed set of points in the plane. We
show how this method can be generalized to obtain results for various other
types of graphs that are embedded in the plane. Specifically, we obtain a new
bound of $O^*(187.53^N)$ (where the $O^*()$ notation hides polynomial factors)
for the maximum number of crossing-free straight-edge graphs that can be
embedded over any specific set of $N$ points in the plane (improving upon the
previous best upper bound $207.85^N$ in Hoffmann et al.). We also derive upper
bounds for numbers of several other types of plane graphs (such as connected
and bi-connected plane graphs), and obtain various bounds on expected
vertex-degrees in graphs that are uniformly chosen from the set of all
crossing-free straight-edge graphs that can be embedded over a specific point
set.
  We then show how to apply the cross-graph charging-scheme method for graphs
that allow certain types of crossings. Specifically, we consider graphs with no
set of $k$ pairwise-crossing edges (more commonly known as $k$-quasi-planar
graphs). For $k=3$ and $k=4$, we prove that, for any set $S$ of $N$ points in
the plane, the number of graphs that have a straight-edge $k$-quasi-planar

variances. We apply the developed method on synthetic and real data examples

single spins are undetectable by conventional far-field resonance techniques.
In recent years, there has been a considerable effort to develop nanoscale
scanning magnetometers, which are able to measure fewer spins by bringing the
sensor in close proximity to its target. The most sensitive of these
magnetometers generally require low temperatures for operation, but measuring
under ambient conditions (standard temperature and pressure) is critical for
many imaging applications, particularly in biological systems. Here we
demonstrate detection and nanoscale imaging of the magnetic field from a single

deterministically scanning our NV magnetometer 50 nanometers above a target
electron spin, while measuring the local magnetic field using dynamically
decoupled magnetometry protocols. This single-spin detection capability could
enable single-spin magnetic resonance imaging of electron spins on the nano-

level of side-chain atoms we observe a strong correlation between the
positioning of the atom and the underlying local secondary structure with very
little if any variation between the different amino acids. As a concrete
example we analyze the left-handed helix region of non-glycyl amino acids. This
region corresponds to an isolated and highly localized residue independent
sector in the direction of the C-beta carbons on the two-sphere. We show that
the residue independent localization extends to C-gamma and C-delta carbons,
and to side-chain oxygen and nitrogen atoms in the case of asparagine and
aspartic acid. When we extend the analysis to the side-chain atoms of the
neighboring residues, we observe that left-handed beta-turns display a regular
and largely amino acid independent structure that can extend to seven
consecutive residues. This collective pattern is duu to the presence of a
backbone soliton. We show how one can use our visualization techniques to
analyze and classify the different solitons in terms of selection rules that we
describe in detail.

consisting in estimating the parameters of models for the stellar structure and

solve this problem for alpha Cen A, which allows us to incorporate prior
information on the parameters to be estimated, in order to better constrain the
problem. Our strategy is based on the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm to estimate the posterior probability densities of the stellar
parameters: mass, age, initial chemical composition,... We use the stellar
evolutionary code ASTEC to model the star. To constrain this model both seismic
and non-seismic observations were considered. Several different strategies were
tested to fit these values, either using two or five free parameters in ASTEC.
We are thus able to show evidence that MCMC methods become efficient with
respect to more classical grid-based strategies when the number of parameters
increases. The results of our MCMC algorithm allow us to derive estimates for
the stellar parameters and robust uncertainties thanks to the statistical
analysis of the posterior probability densities. We are also able to compute
odds for the presence of a convective core in alpha Cen A. When using
core-sensitive seismic observational constraints, these can raise above ~40%.
The comparison of results to previous studies also indicates that these seismic
constraints are of critical importance for our knowledge of the structure of

cosmic rays (CRs). Dark matter self-annihilation can lead to a high luminosity
in gamma rays and neutrinos, enhanced by a strong degree of clustering in dark
matter substructures. Hadronic CR interactions can also lead to a high
luminosity in gamma rays and neutrinos, enhanced by the confinement of CRs from
cluster accretion/merger shocks and active galactic nuclei. We show that
IceCube/KM3Net observations of high-energy neutrinos can probe the nature of
GCs and the separate dark matter and CR emission processes, taking into account
how the results depend on the still-substantial uncertainties. Neutrino
observations are relevant at high energies, especially at >10 TeV. Our results
should be useful for improving experimental searches for high-energy neutrino
emission. Neutrino telescopes are sensitive to extended sources formed by dark
matter substructures and CRs distributed over large scales. Recent observations
by Fermi and imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes have placed interesting
constraints on the gamma-ray emission from GCs. We also provide calculations of
the gamma-ray fluxes, taking into account electromagnetic cascades inside GCs,
which can be important for injections at sufficiently high energies. This also
allows us to extend previous gamma-ray constraints to very high dark matter
masses and significant CR injections at very high energies. Using both
neutrinos and gamma rays, which can lead to comparable constraints, will allow
more complete understandings of GCs. Neutrinos are essential for some dark
matter annihilation channels, and for hadronic instead of electronic CRs. Our
results suggest that the multi-messenger observations of GCs will be able to
give useful constraints on specific models of dark matter and CRs. [Abstract

with respect to Stage 1 values in RMS error of 0.37 mm. On average the obtained
model output for the tumor position was 95% of the time within an absolute
bound of 2.0 mm and 2.6 mm in Stage 1 and 2, respectively.
  The model was capable of dealing with baseline, amplitude and frequency
variations of the input data, as well as phase shifts between the input tumor
and output abdominal signals. These results indicate that it may be feasible to
collect patient-specific model parameters during or prior to the first
treatment, and then retain these for the rest of the treatment period. The
model has potential for clinical application during radiotherapy treatment of
lung tumors.

  application to electricity markets",,,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we examine in an abstract framework, how a tradeoff between
efficiency and robustness arises in different dynamic oligopolistic market
architectures. We consider a market in which there is a monopolistic resource
provider and agents that enter and exit the market following a random process.
Self-interested and fully rational agents dynamically update their resource
consumption decisions over a finite time horizon, under the constraint that the
total resource consumption requirements are met before each individual's
deadline. We then compare the statistics of the stationary aggregate demand
processes induced by the non-cooperative and cooperative load scheduling
schemes. We show that although the non-cooperative load scheduling scheme leads
to an efficiency loss - widely known as the ""price of anarchy"" - the stationary
distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail.
This tail, which corresponds to rare and undesirable demand spikes, is
important in many applications of interest. On the other hand, when the agents
can cooperate with each other in optimizing their total cost, a higher market
efficiency is achieved at the cost of a higher probability of demand spikes. We
thus posit that the origins of endogenous risk in such systems may lie in the
market architecture, which is an inherent characteristic of the system.

compare the signal to Standard Model backgrounds and demonstrate that, even for

describe the ""location"" of noncrossed products in the Brauer group of general
Henselian valued fields with arbitrary value group and global residue field. We
show that within the fibers defined canonically by Witt's decomposition of the

roughly speaking, separated by an index bound. This generalizes a result of the
first and third author for rank 1 valued Henselian fields.
  Furthermore, we prove that all fibers which are not covered by the rank 1
case, and where the characteristic of the residue field does not interfere,
contain noncrossed products.
  We show by example that, unlike in the rank 1 case, the value of the index
bound does not depend on the number of roots of unity that are present. Thus,
the index bounds are in general of a different nature than in the rank 1 case.

v_star \sim (\dot{E} / 2 \dot{M})^{1/2} describes the effect of starburst
activity, with \dot{E}, \dot{M} as energy and mass injection rate in a central
region of radius R; (b) \vbh ~ (G\mbh / 2 R)^{1/2} for the effect of a central
black hole of mass \mbh on gas at distance R and (c) v_{s} =(GM_h/ 2Cr_s)^{1/2}
which is closely related to the galaxy circular velocity, with C as a function
of halo concentration parameter. We find the wind terminal speed to be 2
(v_star^2 +1.5(\Gamma -1) \vbh^2 -v_s^2)^{1/2}, where \Gamma is the ratio of
force due to radiation pressure to gravity of the central black hole. We also
find that: (a) winds from quiescent star forming galaxies cannot escape from
10^{11.5} \le M_h \le 10^{12.5}Msun galaxies, (b) circumgalactic gas at large
distances should be present for galaxies in this mass range, (c) for an
escaping wind, the wind speed in low to intermediate mass galaxies is ~
400--1000 km/s, consistent with observed X-ray temperatures; (d) winds from
massive galaxies with AGN have speeds \gtrsim 1000 km/s. We also find that the
ratio [2 v_star ^2 -(1 -\Gamma) \vbh^2]/ v_c^2 dictates the amount of gas lost.
Used in conjunction with an appropriate relation between \mbh and M_h, and an
appropriate opacity of dust grains in IR (K band), this ratio becomes minimum
at a certain halo mass scale (M_h ~ 10^{12--12.5} Msun) that signifies the
cross-over of AGN domination in outflow properties from starburst activity at
lower masses. We find that stellar mass for massive galaxies scales as M_star
\propto M_h^{0.26},and for low mass galaxies, M_star \propto M_h^{5/3}.

much smaller than the fine structure splitting is considered. The inelastic
collision rates between the different levels are included in our treatment. We
account for the depolarization caused by the collisions coupling the fine

between the fine structure states. When the fine structure splitting goes to
zero, we recover the redistribution matrix that represents the scattering on a
two-level atom (which exhibits only m-state interference --- namely the Hanle
effect). The way in which the multipolar index of the scattering atom enters
into the expression for the redistribution matrix through the collisional

have been shown to be powerful tools for organizing high dimensional data. Here
we consider a data set X in which the graph associated with it changes
depending on some set of parameters. We analyze this type of data in terms of
the diffusion distance and the corresponding diffusion map. As the data changes
over the parameter space, the low dimensional embedding changes as well. We
give a way to go between these embeddings, and furthermore, map them all into a
common space, allowing one to track the evolution of X in its intrinsic
geometry. A global diffusion distance is also defined, which gives a measure of
the global behavior of the data over the parameter space. Approximation
theorems in terms of randomly sampled data are presented, as are potential
applications.

quasitopological gravity has not a well-defined variational principle. In this
paper, we first introduce a surface term that makes the variation of quartic
quasitopological gravity well defined. Second, we present the static charged
solutions of quartic quasitopological gravity in the presence of a non linear
electromagnetic field. One of the branch of these solutions presents a black
brane with one or two horizons or a naked singularity depending on the charge
and mass of the solution. The thermodynamic of these black branes are
investigated through the use of the Gibbs free energy. In order to do this, we
calculate the finite action by use of the counterterm method inspired by
AdS/CFT correspondence. Introducing a Smarr-type formula, we also show that the
conserved and thermodynamics quantities of these solutions satisfy the first
law of thermodynamics. Finally, we present the charged rotating black branes in
$(n+1)$ dimensions with $k\leq [n/2]$ rotation parameters and investigate their
thermodynamics.

explore a number of functional forms for the vertical force law, and fit the
dispersion and density profiles of all abundance selected sub-populations
simultaneously in the same potential, and explore all parameter co-variances
using MCMC. Our fits constrain a disk {\it mass} scale height $\lesssim$ 300 pc

level. The data are used to construct the cosmic spectral energy distribution
(CSED) from 0.1 to 2.1 \mum free from any wavelength dependent cosmic variance
for both the elliptical and non-elliptical populations. The two populations
exhibit dramatically different CSEDs as expected for a predominantly old and
young population respectively. Using the Driver et al. (2008) prescription for
the azimuthally averaged photon escape fraction, the non-ellipticals are
corrected for the impact of dust attenuation and the combined CSED constructed.
The final results show that the Universe is currently generating (1.8 +/- 0.3)
x 10^{35} h W Mpc^{-3} of which (1.2 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h W Mpc^{-3} is
directly released into the inter-galactic medium and (0.6 +/- 0.1) x 10^{35} h
W Mpc^{-3} is reprocessed and reradiated by dust in the far-IR. Using the GAMA
data and our dust model we predict the mid and far-IR emission which agrees
remarkably well with available data. We therefore provide a robust description
of the pre- and post dust attenuated energy output of the nearby Universe from
0.1micron to 0.6mm. The largest uncertainty in this measurement lies in the mid
and far-IR bands stemming from the dust attenuation correction and its
currently poorly constrained dependence on environment, stellar mass, and

a problem, if we provide less than k times the resource required to compute one
instance, then the probability of overall success is exponentially small in k.
In this paper, we consider the model of two-way public-coin communication
complexity and show a strong direct product theorem for all relations in terms
of the smooth rectangle bound, introduced by Jain and Klauck as a generic lower
bound method in this model. Our result therefore uniformly implies a strong
direct product theorem for all relations for which an (asymptotically) optimal
lower bound can be provided using the smooth rectangle bound, for example Inner
Product, Greater-Than, Set-Disjointness, Gap-Hamming Distance etc. Our result
also implies near optimal direct product results for several important
functions and relations used to show exponential separations between classical
and quantum communication complexity, for which near optimal lower bounds are
provided using the rectangle bound, for example by Raz [1999], Gavinsky [2008]
and Klartag and Regev [2011]. In fact we are not aware of any relation for
which it is known that the smooth rectangle bound does not provide an optimal
lower bound. This lower bound subsumes many of the other lower bound methods,
for example the rectangle bound (a.k.a the corruption bound), the smooth
discrepancy bound (a.k.a the \gamma_2 bound) which in turn subsumes the
discrepancy bound, the subdistribution bound and the conditional min-entropy
bound.

in the two supernova remnants IC 443 and HB 21, which are well known for their
interactions with nearby molecular clouds. The observations were performed with
Infrared Camera (IRC) aboard the AKARI satellite. At the energy range 7000 K <=
E(v,J) <= 20000 K, the shocked H2 gas in IC 443 shows an ortho-to-para ratio
(OPR) of 2.4+0.3-0.2, which is significantly lower than the equilibrium value
3, suggesting the existence of non-equilibrium OPR. The shocked gas in HB 21
also indicates a potential non-equilibrium OPR in the range of 1.8-2.0. The
level populations are well described by the power-law thermal admixture model
with a single OPR, where the temperature integration range is 1000-4000 K. We
conclude that the obtained non-equilibrium OPR probably originates from the
reformed H2 gas of dissociative J-shocks, considering several factors such as
the shock combination requirement, the line ratios, and the possibility that H2
gas can form on grains with a non-equilibrium OPR. We also investigate C-shocks
and partially-dissociative J-shocks for the origin of the non-equilibrium OPR.
However, we find that they are incompatible with the observed ionic emission
lines for which dissociative J-shocks are required to explain. The difference
in the collision energy of H atoms on grain surfaces would make the observed
difference between the OPRs of IC 443 and HB 21, if dissociative J-shocks are
responsible for the H2 emission. Our study suggests that dissociative J-shocks
can make shocked H2 gas with a non-equilibrium OPR.

this paper we will address the specific phenomenology of two of such
transitions, namely the crust-core solid-liquid transition at sub-saturation
density, and the possible strange transition at super-saturation density in the
presence of hyperonic degrees of freedom. Concerning the neutron star
crust-core phase transition at zero and finite temperature, it will be shown
that, as a consequence of the presence of long-range Coulomb interactions, the
equivalence of statistical ensembles is violated and a clusterized phase is
expected which is not accessible in the grand-canonical ensemble. A specific
quasi-particle model will be introduced to illustrate this anomalous
thermodynamics and some quantitative results relevant for the supernova
dynamics will be shown. The opening of hyperonic degrees of freedom at higher
densities corresponding to the neutron stars core modifies the equation of
state. The general characteristics and order of phase transitions in this
regime will be analyzed in the framework of a self-consistent mean-field

tails related to a recent ram-pressure stripping event. The Virgo cluster has
been extensively observed at 1539 A in the far-ultraviolet for the GALEX
Ultraviolet Virgo Cluster Survey (GUViCS), and in the optical for the Next
Generation Virgo Survey (NGVS), allowing a study of the stellar emission
potentially associated with the gas tails of 8 cluster members. On the
theoretical side, models of ram-pressure stripping events have started to
include the physics of star formation. Aim: We aim to provide quantitative
constraints on the amount of star formation taking place in the ram-pressure
stripped gas, mainly on the basis of the far-UV emission found in the GUViCS
images in relation with the gas content of the tails. Methods: We have
performed three comparisons of the young stars emission with the gas column
density: visual, pixel-by-pixel and global. We have compared our results to
other observational and theoretical studies. Results: We find that the level of
star formation taking place in the gas stripped from galaxies by ram-pressure
is low with respect to the available amount of gas. Star formation is lower by
at least a factor 10 compared to the predictions of the Schmidt Law as
determined in regular spiral galaxy disks. It is also lower than measured in
dwarfs galaxies and the outer regions of spirals, and than predicted by some
numerical simulations. We provide constraints on the star formation efficiency
in the ram-pressure stripped gas tails, and compare these with current models.

Q2130-431, does show broad optical lines, while other two, IRAS01428-0404 and
NGC4698, are very likely absorbed by Compton-thick gas along the line of sight.
Therefore, these four sources are not unabsorbed Seyfert 2s as previously
suggested in the literature. On the other hand, we confirm that NGC3147,
NGC3660, and Q2131-427 belong to the class of true Type 2 Seyfert galaxies,
since they do not show any evidence for a broad component of the optical lines
nor for obscuration in their X-ray spectra. These three sources have low
accretion rates ($\dot{m}= L_{bol}/L_{Edd} \la0.01$), in agreement with
theoretical models which predict that the BLR disappears below a critical value
of $L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$. The last source, Mrk273x, would represent an exception
even of this accretion-dependent versions of the Unification Models, due to its
high X-ray luminosity and accretion rate, and no evidence for obscuration.
However, its optical classification as a Seyfert 2 is only based on the absence
of a broad component of the H\beta, due to the lack of optical spectra
encompassing the H\alpha\ band.

wide-angle outflow seen in the Orion BN/KL region correlates with the famous H2

emissions have been reported toward the Orion molecular cloud 1 core region
using the APEX telescope. Therefore, it is of interest to investigate this
outflow in the higher-J 12CO emission, which is likely excited by shocks. The
observations were carried out using the dual-color heterodyne array CHAMP+ on
the APEX telescope. The images of the Orion BN/KL region were obtained in the
12CO J=6-5 and J=7-6 transitions with angular resolutions of 8.6 and 7.4
arcsec, respectively. The results show a good agreement between our higher-J
12CO emission and SMA low-J 12CO data, which indicates that this wide-angle
outflow in Orion BN/KL is likely the result of an explosive event that is
related to the runaway objects from a dynamically decayed multiple system. From
our observations, we estimate that the kinetic energy of this explosive outflow
is about 1-2x10^47 erg. In addition, a scenario has been proposed where part of
the outflow is decelerated and absorbed in the cloud to explain the lack of CO
bullets in the southern part of BN/KL, which in turn induces the methanol
masers seen in this region.

distance to the system of KR Cyg as {411$\pm$12} pc using the observed apparent
UBV magnitudes and the bolometric corrections for the component stars. We also
searched for the empirical determination of albedo and effective temperature of
the cooler, less massive star of KR Cyg, and of two similar near contact
binaries AK CMi, and DO Cas. The residuals between the observed and computed
fluxes are attributed to the effect of mutual illumination which heats the
surface layers of the illuminated star and does vary not only its bolometric
albedo but also its limb-darkening coefficient and gravity-brightening
exponent. The analysis of the light curves shows that the effective albedos are
generally smaller than that expected from an envelope of convective star, being
mostly departed from the theoretical value at the B passband. As the reflected
light diminishes the effective temperature and, therefore, the luminosity of
the irradiated star increase. The observed bluer U-B colors during primary

scattering processes which may alter several characteristics of these systems.

lead to a dramatic shortening of the period of validity of the mean field
analysis. However, even in the limit where the number of bosons equal the

mean-field approach leading to a finite, albeit short, Ehrenfest time. Through
finite size analysis, we also present indications that the mean field approach

between IBHs of 10 pc. Our study shows that the magnetic flux, accumulated on
the horizon of an IBH because of accretion of interstellar matter, allows the
Blandford-Znajeck mechanism to be activated. Thus, electron-positron jets can
be launched. We have performed 2D numerical modelling which allowed the jet
power to be estimated. Their inferred properties make such jets a feasible
electron accelerator which, in molecular clouds, allows electron energy to be
boosted up to 1 PeV. For the conditions expected in molecular clouds the
radiative cooling time should be comparable to the escape time. Thus these
sources can contribute both to the population of unidentified point-like
sources and to the local cosmic ray (CR) electron spectrum. The impact of the
generated electron CRs depends on the diffusion rate inside molecular clouds
(MCs). If the diffusion regime in a MC is similar to Galactic diffusion, the
produced electrons should rapidly escape the cloud and contribute to the
Galactic CR population at very high energies >100 TeV. However, due to the
modest jet luminosity (at the level of 10^35 erg s^-1) and low filling factor
of MC, these sources cannot make a significant contribution to the spectrum of
cosmic ray electrons at lower energies. On the other hand, if the diffusion
within MCs operates at a rate close to the Bohm limit, the CR electrons
escaping from the source should be confined in the cloud, significantly
contributing to the local density of CRs. The IC emission of these
locally-generated CRs may explain the variety of gamma ray spectra detected
from nearby MCs.

high-velocity molecular gas. Recent models predict relatively high abundances
behind interstellar shockwaves. The dynamical and physical conditions of the
H2O emitting gas, however, are not fully understood yet. We aim to determine
the abundance and distribution of H2O, its kinematics and the physical
conditions of the gas responsible for the H2O emission. The observed line
profile shapes help us understand the dynamics in molecular outflows. We mapped
the VLA1623 outflow, in the ground-state transitions of o-H2O, with the HIFI
and PACS instruments. We also present observations of higher energy transitions
of o-H2O and p-H2O obtained with HIFI and PACS towards selected outflow
positions. From comparison with non-LTE radiative transfer calculations, we
estimate the physical parameters of the water emitting regions. The observed
water emission line profiles vary over the mapped area. Spectral features and
components, tracing gas in different excitation conditions, allow us to
constrain the density and temperature of the gas. The H2O emission originates
in a region where temperatures are comparable to that of the warm H2 gas
(T\gtrsim200K). Thus, the H2O emission traces a gas component significantly
warmer than the gas responsible for the low-J CO emission. The H2O column
densities at the CO peak positions are low, i.e. N(H2O) \simeq (0.03-10)x10e14
cm-2. The H2O abundance with respect to H2 in the extended outflow is estimated
at X(H2O)<1x10e-6, significantly lower than what would be expected from most
recent shock models. The H2O emission traces a gas component moving at
relatively high velocity compared to the low-J CO emitting gas. However, other
dynamical quantities such as the momentum rate, energy and mechanical

the escape term, e.g., with the diffusion-loss equation becoming advective,
others approximated the losses as catastrophic, so that the equation has only

the inertialess electron momentum equation including the electrostatic,

closes our nonlinear system of equations. When the electric field is eliminated

then obtain a generalized GVEM and the ion continuity equations exhibiting
nonlinear couplings between the ion number density and the ion fluid velocity.
The pair of nonlinear equations is numerically solved to study the dynamics of
arbitrary large amplitudes planar and non-planar ES shocks arising from the
balance between harmonic generation nonlinearities and the ion fluid viscosity

relevant for the cores of giant planets (viz. the Jupiter) and compact stars

is calibrated for source confusion and crowding with artificial galaxy counts
and here we verify our results with sub-mm surface brightnesses from archival

correlate well with the surface density of atomic (Hi) or molecular hydrogen
(H2) alone implying that dust is not only associated with the molecular clouds
but also the diffuse atomic disk in these galaxies. Our result is a typical
dust-to-gas ratio of 0.04, with some evidence that this ratio declines with
galactocentric radius, consistent with recent Herschel results. We discuss the
possible causes of this high dust-to-gas ratio; an over-estimate of the dust
surface-density, an under-estimate of the molecular hydrogen density from CO
maps or a combination of both. We note that while our value of the mean
dust-to-gas ratio is high, it is consistent with the metallicity at the
measured radii if one assumes the Pilyugin & Thuan calibration of gas
metallicity.

technology in recent times has emerged as a possible way of efficient solution

strategy in managing the demand supply chain. We target the grains distribution
system among various centers of Food Corporation of India (FCI) as application
domain. We assume centers with larger stocks as objects of greater mass and
vice versa. Applying Newtonian law of gravity as suggested in GSA, larger
objects attract objects of smaller mass towards itself, creating a virtual
grain supply source. As heavier object sheds its mass by supplying some to the
one in demand, it loses its gravitational pull and thus keeps the whole system
of supply chain per-fectly in balance. The multi agent system helps in
continuous updation of the whole system with the help of autonomous agents
which react to the change in environment and act accordingly. This model also
reduces the communication bottleneck to greater extents.

on biomolecular mechanisms. The biophysical model, is an alternative approach,
speculating that collinearity is caused by physical forces pulling the Hox
clusters from a territory where they are inactive to a distinct spatial domain
where they are activated in a step by step manner.
  Hox gene translocations have recently been observed in support of the
biophysical model. Furthermore, genetic engineering experiments, performed in
embryonic mice, gave rise to some unexpected mutant expressions that
biomolecular models could not predict. In several cases when anterior Hoxd
genes are deleted, the expression of the genes whose expression is probed in
the mutants are impossible to anticipate. On the contrary, the biophysical
model offers convincing explanation.
  All these experimental results support the idea of physical forces being
responsible for Hox gene collinearity. In order to test the validity of the
various models further, certain experiment involving gene deletions are
proposed. The biophysical and biomolecular models predict different results for
these experiments, hence the expected outcome will confirm or question the
validity of these models.

case of idempotent probability measures and so an instance of idempotent states

dynamo model is explored. We employ a flux transport dynamo model coupled with
simple feedback formulae relating the thickness of the tachocline to the
amplitude of the magnetic field or to the Maxwell stress. The dynamo model is
found to be robust against the nonlinearity introduced by this simplified fast
tachocline mechanism. Solar-like butterfly diagrams are found to persist and,
even without any parameter fitting, the overall thickness of the tachocline is
well within the range admitted by helioseismic constraints. In the most
realistic case of a time and latitude dependent tachocline thickness linked to
the value of the Maxwell stress, both the thickness and its latitude dependence
are in excellent agreement with seismic results. In the nonparametric models,
cycle related temporal variations in tachocline thickness are somewhat larger
than admitted by helioseismic constraints; we find, however, that introducing a
further parameter into our feedback formula readily allows further fine tuning
of the thickness variations.

outburst the type-C LFQPOs reached frequencies that are among the highest ever
seen for LFQPOs in black holes. At the peak of the outburst, in the
ultra-luminous state, the power spectrum showed two simultaneous,
non-harmonically related peaks which we identified as a type-B and a type-C
QPO. The simultaneous presence of a type-C and type-B QPO shows that at least
two of the three known LFQPO types are intrinsically different and likely the
result of distinct physical mechanisms. We also studied the properties of a
broad peaked noise component in the power spectra of the ultra-luminous state.
This noise component becomes more coherent with count rate and there are strong
suggestions that it evolves into a type-B QPO at the highest observed count
rates.

isocurvature transfer functions differ from the adiabatic one, the coexistence
of a primordial isocurvature mode with the usual adiabatic mode leads to a rich
structure of the angular bispectrum, which can be decomposed into six
elementary bispectra. Future analysis of the CMB data will enable to measure
their relative weights, or at least constrain them. Non-Gaussianity thus
provides a new window on isocurvature modes. This is particularly relevant for
some scenarios, such as those presented here, which generate isocurvature modes

obtained from the recently updated HIJING 2.0 model, the recent anisotropic
flow and suppression data for charged hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC
center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV are explored to constrain the properties of
the partonic medium formed. In contrast to RHIC, the measured centrality
dependence of charged hadron multiplicity dN_ch/deta at LHC provides severe
constraint to the largely uncertain gluon shadowing parameter s_g. We find
final-state parton scatterings reduce considerably hadron yield at midrapidity
and enforces a smaller s_g to be consistent with dN_ch/deta data at LHC. With
the parton shadowing so constrained, hadron production and flow over a wide
transverse momenta range are investigated in AMPT. The model calculations for
the elliptic and triangular flow are found to be in excellent agreement with
the RHIC data, and predictions for the flow coefficients v_n(p_T, cent) at LHC
are given. The magnitude and pattern of suppression of the hadrons in AMPT are
found consistent with the measurements at RHIC. However, the suppression is
distinctly overpredicted in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC energy. Reduction of
the QCD coupling constant alpha_s by ~30% in the higher temperature plasma
formed at LHC reproduces the measured hadron suppression.

homeostasis in humans and mice. However, the mechanisms that control
homeostasis of the activated IgM-secreting B cells are unknown. After adoptive
transfer into immune-deficient hosts, B-lymphocytes expand poorly but fully
reconstitute the pool of natural IgM-secreting cells and circulating IgM
levels. By using sequential cell transfers and B cell populations from several
mutant mice, we were able to identify novel mechanisms regulating the size of
the IgM-secreting B cell pool. Contrary to previous mechanisms described
regulating homeostasis, which involve competition for the same niche by cells
having overlapping survival requirements, homeostasis of the innate
IgM-secreting B cell pool is also achieved when B cells populations are able to
monitor the number of activated B cells by detecting their secreted products.
Notably, B cell populations are able to assess the density of activated B cells
by sensing their secreted IgG. This process involves the Fc{\gamma}RIIB, a
low-affinity IgG receptor that is expressed on B cells and acts as a negative
regulator of B cell activation, and its intracellular effector the inositol
phosphatase SHIP. As a result of the engagement of this inhibitory pathway the
number of activated IgM-secreting B cells is kept under control. We hypothesize
that malfunction of this quorum-sensing mechanism may lead to uncontrolled B
cell activation and autoimmunity.

variety of spreading processes, the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix
of the network plays a key role on their global dynamical behavior. For many
real-world large-scale networks, it is unfeasible to exactly retrieve the
complete network structure to compute its largest eigenvalue. Instead, one
usually have access to myopic, egocentric views of the network structure, also
called egonets. In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework, based on
algebraic graph theory and convex optimization, to study how local structural
properties of the network constrain the interval of possible values in which
the largest eigenvalue must lie. Based on this framework, we present a
computationally efficient approach to find this interval from a collection of
egonets. Our numerical simulations show that, for several social and
communication networks, local structural properties of the network strongly
constrain the location of the largest eigenvalue and the resulting spreading
dynamics. From a practical point of view, our results can be used to dictate
immunization strategies to tame the spreading of a virus, or to design network
topologies that facilitate the spreading of information virally.

foreground emission from the Galaxy and extragalactic radio sources are

extragalactic foreground comes from the clustering of very weak sources. We
assess its amplitude and discuss ways by which it might be mitigated. We then
introduce our concept for a single dish telescope designed to detect BAO at low

receiver array held 90 m above the under-illuminated dish. Correlation
receivers will be used with each main science beam referenced against an

properties of the trapped BEC with the equal Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
couplings. In the experimentally-feasible regime, the phase transition from the
separate phase to the single minimum phase can be well driven by the tunable
temperature. Moreover, the critical temperature, which is independent of the
trapped potential, can be derived exactly. At the critical point, the specific
heat has a large jump and can be thus regarded as a promising candidate to
detect this temperature-driven phase transition. In addition, we obtain the
analytical expressions for the specific heat and the entropy in the different
phases. In the single minimum phase, the specific heat as well as the entropy
are governed only by the Rabi frequency. However, in the separate phase with
lower temperature, we find that they are determined only by the strength of
spin-orbit coupling. Finally, the effect of the effective atom interaction is
also addressed. In the separate phase, this effective atom interaction affects
dramatically on the critical temperature and the corresponding thermodynamic

~2x10^55 erg, and their age is ~10^6 years. Comparing these results with those
we previously obtained for Centaurus A, NGC 3801 and Mrk 6, we show that these
parameters scale approximately with the radio power of the parent AGN. The
spatial coincidence between the X-ray and edge-brightened radio emission in
Circinus resembles the morphology of some SNR shocks. This parallel has been
expected for AGN, but has never been observed before. We investigate what
underlying mechanisms both types of systems may have in common, arguing that,
in Circinus, the edge-brightening in the shells may be accounted for by a B
field enhancement caused by shock compression, but do not preclude some local
particle acceleration. These results can be extrapolated to other low-power
systems, particularly those with late type hosts.

Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols which employ a particular message
authentication code suggested previously. This authentication code, featuring
low key consumption, is not Information-Theoretically Secure (ITS) since for
each message the eavesdropper has intercepted she is able to send a different
message from a set of messages that she can calculate by finding collisions of
a cryptographic hash function. However, when this authentication code was
introduced it was shown to prevent straightforward Man-In-The-Middle (MITM)
attacks against QKD protocols.
  In this paper, we prove that the set of messages that collide with any given
message under this authentication code contains with high probability a message
that has small Hamming distance to any other given message. Based on this fact
we present extended MITM attacks against different versions of BB84 QKD
protocols using the addressed authentication code; for three protocols we
describe every single action taken by the adversary. For all protocols the
adversary can obtain complete knowledge of the key, and for most protocols her
success probability in doing so approaches unity.
  Since the attacks work against all authentication methods which allow to
calculate colliding messages, the underlying building blocks of the presented
attacks expose the potential pitfalls arising as a consequence of non-ITS
authentication in QKD-postprocessing. We propose countermeasures, increasing
the eavesdroppers demand for computational power, and also prove necessary and
sufficient conditions for upgrading the discussed authentication code to the
ITS level.

in a power-law fashion, were recently proposed to model the critical statistics
of the Floquet eigenstates of periodically driven quantum systems. In this
work, we numerically study in detail the statistical properties of PRBUM
ensembles in the delocalization-localization transition regime. In particular,
implications of the delocalization-localization transition for the fractal
dimension of the eigenvectors, for the distribution function of the eigenvector
components, and for the nearest neighbor spacing statistics of the eigenphases
are examined. On the one hand, our results further indicate that a PRBUM
ensemble can serve as a unitary analog of the power-law random Hermitian matrix
model for Anderson transition. On the other hand, some statistical features
unseen before are found from PRBUM. For example, the dependence of the fractal
dimension of the eigenvectors of PRBUM upon one ensemble parameter displays
features that are quite different from that for the power-law random Hermitian
matrix model. Furthermore, in the time-reversal symmetric case the nearest
neighbor spacing distribution of PRBUM eigenphases is found to obey a
semi-Poisson distribution for a broad range, but display an anomalous level
repulsion in the absence of time-reversal symmetry.

dark matter relic density and direct detection data from Xenon100. The doubly
charged and one charged scalars can enhance the annihilation cross section of

$SS\to\gamma Z$, and the cross section is approximately 0.76 times that of

reveal disagreements among the theory, numerical simulations, and observations.
A method that was developed by the authors to describe equilibrium DM systems
is presented, which allows investigating these complex nonlinear structures
analytically and relating density distribution profiles within a halo both to
the parameters of the initial small-scale inhomogeneity field and to the
nonlinear relaxation characteristics of gravitationally compressed matter. It
is shown that cosmological random motions of matter `heat up' the DM particles
in collapsing halos, suppressing cusp-like density profiles within developing
halos, facilitating the formation of DM cores in galaxies, and providing an
explanation for the difference between observed and simulated galactic rotation
curves. The analytic conclusions obtained within this approach can be confirmed
by the N-body model simulation once improved spatial resolution is achieved for

discussed strongly interacting gauge theory with a fermion flavor doublet in
the two-index symmetric (sextet) representation of the SU(3) color gauge group.
We find that the chiral condensate and the mass spectrum of the sextet model
are consistent with chiral symmetry breaking in the limit of vanishing fermion
mass. In contrast, sextet fermion mass deformations of spectral properties are
not consistent with leading conformal scaling behavior near the critical
surface of a conformal theory. A recent paper could not resolve the conformal
fixed point of the gauge coupling from the slowly walking scenario of a very
small nearly vanishing \beta-function (DeGrand:2012yq). It is argued that
overall consistency with our new results is resolved if the sextet model is
close to the conformal window, staying outside with a very small non-vanishing
\beta-function. The model would exhibit then the simplest composite Higgs
mechanism leaving open the possibility of a light scalar state with quantum
numbers of the Higgs impostor. It would emerge as the pseudo-Goldstone dilaton
state from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scale invariance. We will argue
that even without association with the dilaton, the scalar Higgs-like state can
be light very close to the conformal window. A new Higgs project of sextet
lattice simulations is outlined to resolve these important questions.

busts, crises and upheavals of all sorts. Understanding the origin of these
events is arguably one of the most important problems in economic theory. In
this paper, we review recent efforts to include heterogeneities and
interactions in models of decision. We argue that the Random Field Ising model
(RFIM) indeed provides a unifying framework to account for many collective
socio-economic phenomena that lead to sudden ruptures and crises. We discuss
different models that can capture potentially destabilising self-referential
feedback loops, induced either by herding, i.e. reference to peers, or
trending, i.e. reference to the past, and account for some of the phenomenology
missing in the standard models. We discuss some empirically testable
predictions of these models, for example robust signatures of RFIM-like herding
effects, or the logarithmic decay of spatial correlations of voting patterns.
One of the most striking result, inspired by statistical physics methods, is
that Adam Smith's invisible hand can badly fail at solving simple coordination
problems. We also insist on the issue of time-scales, that can be extremely
long in some cases, and prevent socially optimal equilibria to be reached. As a
theoretical challenge, the study of so-called ""detailed-balance"" violating
decision rules is needed to decide whether conclusions based on current models
(that all assume detailed-balance) are indeed robust and generic.

Its
lysogenic and lytic life cycles echo competition between the DNA binding
$\lambda$-repressor (CI) and CRO proteins. Here we scrutinize the structure,
stability and folding pathways of the $\lambda$-repressor protein, that
controls the transition from the lysogenic to the lytic state. We first
investigate the super-secondary helix-loop-helix composition of its backbone.
We use a discrete Frenet framing to resolve the backbone spectrum in terms of
bond and torsion angles. Instead of four, there appears to be seven individual
loops. We model the putative loops using an explicit soliton Ansatz. It is
based on the standard soliton profile of the continuum nonlinear Schr\""odinger
equation. The accuracy of the Ansatz far exceeds the B-factor fluctuation
distance accuracy of the experimentally determined protein configuration. We
then investigate the folding pathways and dynamics of the $\lambda$-repressor
protein. We introduce a coarse-grained energy function to model the backbone in
terms of the C$_\alpha$ atoms and the side-chains in terms of the relative
orientation of the C$_\beta$ atoms. We describe the folding dynamics in terms
of relaxation dynamics, and find that the folded configuration can be reached
from a very generic initial configuration. We conclude that folding is
dominated by the temporal ordering of soliton formation. In particular, the
third soliton should appear before the first and second. Otherwise, the DNA
binding turn does not acquire its correct structure. We confirm the stability
of the folded configuration by repeated heating and cooling simulations.

neutrinos escaping the star (termed ""Neutrino Star Turning"" mechanism, $\nu S
