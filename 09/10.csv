small fraction of extremely beryllium-deficient stars, which challenges our
current understanding of light element depletion in these stars. We suggest two
possible scenarios that may explain this high level of Be depletion: early
accretion and rotational mixing. We show that in both cases, the conditions
required to reach the observed level of Be depletion are quite extreme, which
explains the very small fraction of detected Be outliers. We suggest that
substantial Be depletion can be obtained in stars if they were fast rotators in
the past, with high initial rotational velocities and short disc lifetimes. Our
analysis suggests that rotational mixing may not be efficient enough to deplete
Be in less than 10 Myr. Consequently, the detection of strongly Be-deficient
stars in clusters younger than $\sim$ 10 Myr may provide a genuine signature of
accretion process and the proof that some protostars may undergo many extreme
bursts of accretion during their embedded phases of evolution.

has yet to be constructed. In this paper we examine the Galois group of SICs
covariant with respect to the Weyl-Heisenberg group (or WH SICs as we refer to
them). The great majority (though not all) of the known examples are of this
type. Scott and Grassl have noted that every known exact WH SIC is expressible
in radicals (except for dimension 3 which is exceptional in this and several
other respects), which means that the corresponding Galois group is solvable.
They have also calculated the Galois group for most known exact examples. The
purpose of this paper is to take the analysis of Scott and Grassl further. We
first prove a number of theorems regarding the structure of the Galois group
and the relation between it and the extended Clifford group. We then examine
the Galois group for the known exact fiducials and on the basis of this we
propose a list of nine conjectures concerning its structure. These conjectures
represent a considerable strengthening of the theorems we have actually been
able to prove. Finally we generalize the concept of an anti-unitary to the
concept of a g-unitary, and show that every WH SIC fiducial is an eigenvector
of a family of g-unitaries (apart from dimension 3).

which, to a reasonable degree of statistical uncertainty, fits the profile of
the Standard Model Higgs. One obvious implication is that models which predict
a significant departure from Standard Model phenomenology, such as large exotic
(e.g., invisible) Higgs decay or mixing with a hidden sector scalar, are
already ruled out. This observation threatens the viability of electroweak
baryogenesis, which favors, for example, a lighter Higgs and a Higgs coupled to
or mixed with light scalars. To assess the broad impact of these constraints,
we propose a scheme for classifying models of the electroweak phase transition
and impose constraints on a class-by-class basis. We find that models, such as
the MSSM, which rely on thermal loop effects are severely constrained by the
measurement of a 125 GeV Higgs. Models which rely on tree-level effects from a
light singlet are also restricted by invisible decay and mixing constraints.
Moreover, we find that the parametric region favored by electroweak
baryogenesis often coincides with an enhanced symmetry point with a distinctive
phenomenological character. In particular, enhancements arising through an
approximate continuous symmetry are phenomenologically disfavored, in contrast
with enhancements from discrete symmetries. We also comment on the excess of
diphoton events observed by ATLAS and CMS. We note that although Higgs portal
models can accommodate both enhanced diphoton decay and a strongly first order
electroweak phase transition, the former favors a negative Higgs portal
coupling whereas the latter favors a positive one, and therefore these two
constraints are at tension with one another.

endowing the configuration space with a metric such that the dynamical
trajectories are identified with geodesics. The average curvature and curvature
fluctuations of the energy landscape are computed by means of Monte Carlo
simulations and, when possible, of a mean-field method, showing that these
global geometric quantities provide a clear geometric characterization of the
collapse phase transition occurring in the SGR as the transition from a flat
landscape at high energies to a landscape with mainly positive but fluctuating
curvature in the collapsed phase. Moreover, curvature fluctuations show a
maximum in correspondence with the energy of a possible further transition,
occurring at lower energies than the collapse one, whose existence had been
previously conjectured on the basis of a local analysis of the energy landscape
and whose effect on the usual thermodynamic quantities, if any, is extremely
weak. We also estimate the largest Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ of the SGR using
the geometric observables. The geometric estimate always gives the correct
order of magnitude of $\lambda$ and is also quantitatively correct at small
energy densities and, in the limit $N\to\infty$, in the whole homogeneous

scaling between the atmospheric pressure and the gray thermal optical depth.
The convective portions of our models are taken to follow adiabats that account
for condensation of volatiles through a scaling parameter to the dry adiabat.
By combining these assumptions, we produce simple, analytic expressions that

expressions for the profiles of thermal radiative flux and convective flux. We

worlds where atmospheric attenuation of sunlight is weak, which we show tend to

under gravity in a viscous fluid. The particles do not touch each other and can
move relative to each other. The dynamics is analyzed in the point-particle
approximation. A family of regular configurations is found with periodic
oscillations of all the settling particles. The oscillations are shown to be
robust under some out-of-phase rearrangements of the particles. In the presence
of an additional particle above such a regular configuration, the particle
periodic trajectories are horizontally repelled from the symmetry axis, and
flattened vertically. The results are used to propose a mechanism how a
spherical cloud, made of a large number of particles distributed at random,
evolves and destabilizes.

is free of the initialization problem that affects some quantum computers.
Here, we report the first experimental implementation of a complete KS set that
consists of 18 yes-no tests on four-dimensional quantum systems and show how to
use the KS set to obtain a state-independent quantum advantage. We first
demonstrate the unique power of this KS set for solving a task while avoiding
the problem of state initialization. Such a demonstration is done by showing
that, for 28 different quantum states encoded in the orbital-angular-momentum
and polarization degrees of freedom of single photons, the KS set provides an
impossible-to-beat solution. In a second experiment, we generate maximally
contextual quantum correlations by performing compatible sequential
measurements of the polarization and path of single photons. In this case,
state independence is demonstrated for 15 different initial states. Maximum
contextuality and state independence follow from the fact that the sequences of
measurements project any initial quantum state onto one of the KS set's
eigenstates. Our results show that KS sets can be used for quantum-information
processing and quantum computation and pave the way for future developments.

required from the denser, inner regions to the outer regions of the cloud,
otherwise this can prevent the collapse. Fast magnetic reconnection which takes
place in the presence of turbulence can induce a process of reconnection
diffusion (RD). Extending earlier numerical studies of reconnection diffusion
in cylindrical clouds, we consider more realistic clouds with spherical
gravitational potentials and also account for the effects of the gas
self-gravity. We demonstrate that within our setup RD is efficient. We have
also identified the conditions under which RD becomes strong enough to make an
initially subcritical cloud clump supercritical and induce its collapse. Our
results indicate that the formation of a supercritical core is regulated by a
complex interplay between gravity, self-gravity, the magnetic field strength
and nearly transonic and trans-Alfv\'enic turbulence, confirming that RD is
able to remove magnetic flux from collapsing clumps, but only a few of them
become nearly critical or supercritical, sub-Alfv\'enic cores, which is
consistent with the observations. Besides, we have found that the supercritical
cores built up in our simulations develop a predominantly helical magnetic
field geometry which is also consistent with observations. Finally, we have
evaluated the effective values of the turbulent reconnection diffusion
coefficient and found that they are much larger than the numerical diffusion,
especially for initially trans-Alfv\'enic clouds, ensuring that the detected
magnetic flux removal is due to to the action of the RD rather than to
numerical diffusivity.

emerging so-called hot spot have been calculated in the LTE approximation. The
emission not only in continuum but also in lines has been taken into account
for the first time when calculating the spot spectrum. Comparison with
observations has shown that the strongest of these lines manifest themselves as
narrow components of helium and metal emission lines, while the weaker ones
decrease significantly the depth of photospheric absorption lines, although
until now, this effect has been thought to be due to the emission continuum
alone. The veiling by lines changes the depth of different photospheric lines
to a very different degree even within a narrow spectral range. Therefore, the
nonmonotonic wavelength dependence of the degree of veiling r found for some
CTTS does not suggest a nontrivial spectral energy distribution of the veiling
continuum. In general, it makes sense to specify the degree of veiling r only
by providing the set of photospheric lines from which this quantity was
determined. We show that taking into account the contribution of lines to the
veiling of the photospheric spectrum can cause the existing estimates of the
accretion rate onto T Tauri stars to decrease by several times, with this being
also true for stars with a comparatively weakly veiled spectrum. Neglecting the
contribution of lines to the veiling can also lead to appreciable errors in
determining the effective temperature, interstellar extinction, radial
velocity, and vsin(i).

of 1510 brown dwarf candidates identified by the WISE all-sky survey. Of these,
166 have been spectroscopically classified as objects with spectral types M(1),
L(7), T(146), and Y(12); Sixteen other objects are non-(sub)stellar in nature.
The remainder are most likely distant L and T dwarfs lacking spectroscopic
verification, other Y dwarf candidates still awaiting follow-up, and assorted
other objects whose Spitzer photometry reveals them to be background sources.
We present a catalog of Spitzer photometry for all astrophysical sources
identified in these fields and use this catalog to identify 7 fainter (4.5
$\mu$m $\sim$ 17.0 mag) brown dwarf candidates, which are possibly wide-field
companions to the original WISE sources. To test this hypothesis, we use a
sample of 919 Spitzer observations around WISE-selected high-redshift
hyper-luminous infrared galaxy (HyLIRG) candidates. For this control sample we
find another 6 brown dwarf candidates, suggesting that the 7 companion
candidates are not physically associated. In fact, only one of these 7 Spitzer
brown dwarf candidates has a photometric distance estimate consistent with
being a companion to the WISE brown dwarf candidate. Other than this there is
no evidence for any widely separated ($>$ 20 AU) ultra-cool binaries. As an
adjunct to this paper, we make available a source catalog of $\sim$ 7.33
$\times 10^5$ objects detected in all of these Spitzer follow-up fields for use
by the astronomical community. The complete catalog includes the Spitzer 3.6

focus. We start from a single-colony $C^\Lambda$-process, which arises as the
continuum-mass limit of a $\Lambda$-Cannings individual-based population model,
where $\Lambda$ is a finite non-negative measure that describes the offspring
mechanism. After that we introduce a system of hierarchically interacting
$C^\Lambda$-processes, where the interaction comes from migration and
reshuffling-resampling based on measures $(\Lambda_k)_{k}$ both acting in
$k$-blocks of the hierarchical group. We refer to this system as the
$C_N^{c,\Lambda}$-process. The dual process of the $C_N^{c,\Lambda}$-process is
a spatial coalescent with multi-level block coalescence.
  For the above system we carry out a full renormalisation analysis in the
hierarchical mean-field limit $N\to\infty$. Our main result is that, in the
limit as $N\to\infty$, on each scale $k\in\mathbb{N}_0$ the $k$-block averages
of the $C_N^{c,\Lambda}$-process converge to a random process that is a
superposition of a $C^{\Lambda_k}$-process and a Fleming-Viot process, the
latter with a volatility $d_k$ and with a drift of strength $c_k$ towards the
limiting $(k+1)$-block average. It turns out that $d_k$ is a function of $c_l$
and $\Lambda_l$ for all $0\leq l<k$. Thus, it is through the volatility that
the renormalisation manifests itself.
  We discuss the implications of the scaling of $d_k$ for the behaviour on
large space-time scales of the $C_N^{c,\Lambda}$-process. We compare the
outcome with what is known from the renormalisation analysis of hierarchically
interacting Fleming-Viot diffusions, pointing out several new features. We
obtain a new classification for when the process exhibits clustering,
respectively, exhibits local coexistence. Finally, we show that for finite $N$
the same dichotomy between clustering and local coexistence holds as for
$N\to\infty$.

many biological and physical systems at a discrete level. The average
properties of the population may be described by a continuum model based on
partial differential equations. In this paper we consider multiple interacting
subpopulations/species and study how the inter-species competition emerges at
the population level. Each individual is described as a finite-size hard core
interacting particle undergoing Brownian motion. The link between the discrete
stochastic equations of motion and the continuum model is considered
systematically using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The system
for two species leads to a nonlinear cross-diffusion system for each
subpopulation, which captures the enhancement of the effective diffusion rate
due to excluded-volume interactions between particles of the same species, and
the diminishment due to particles of the other species. This model can explain
two alternative notions of the diffusion coefficient that are often confounded,
namely collective diffusion and self-diffusion. Simulations of the discrete
system show good agreement with the analytic results.

  (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4Frq9pwAz8)",,,,"cs.HC q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) can leave the affected individuals
unable to ambulate. Since there are no restorative treatments for SCI, novel
approaches such as brain-controlled prostheses have been sought. Our recent
studies show that a brain-computer interface (BCI) can be used to control
ambulation within a virtual reality environment (VRE), suggesting that a
BCI-controlled lower extremity prosthesis for ambulation may be feasible.
However, the operability of our BCI has not been tested in a SCI population.
  Methods: Five subjects with paraplegia or tetraplegia due to SCI underwent a
10-min training session in which they alternated between kinesthetic motor
imagery (KMI) of idling and walking while their electroencephalogram (EEG) were
recorded. Subjects then performed a goal-oriented online task, where they
utilized KMI to control the linear ambulation of an avatar and make 10
sequential stops at designated points within the VRE. Multiple online trials
were performed over 5 experimental days.
  Results: Classification accuracy of idling and walking was estimated offline
and ranged from 60.5% (p=0.0176) to 92.3% (p=1.36*10^-20) across subjects and
days. In the online task, all subjects achieved purposeful control with an
average performance of 7.4 +/- 2.3 successful stops in 273 +/- 51 sec (p<0.01).
All subjects maintained purposeful control throughout the study, and their
online performances improved over time.
  Conclusions: The results demonstrate that SCI subjects can purposefully
operate a self-paced BCI walking simulator to complete a goal-oriented
ambulation task. The operation of this BCI system requires short training, is
intuitive, and robust against subject-to-subject and day-to-day
neurophysiological variations. These findings indicate that BCI-controlled
lower extremity prostheses for gait rehabilitation or restoration after SCI may
be feasible in the future.

that diamagnetism is large for a d-wave pseudogap. Our results should apply

$\kappa_e$=1, $\kappa_\mu$=B/A and $\kappa_\tau$=1/B and leads to the vanishing
reactor neutrino mixing angle $\theta_{13}=0$. This generalized scaling is
naturally realized in seesaw textures. To obtain $\theta_{13}\neq 0$ as
required by the recent experimental results, we introduce breaking terms of
scaling ansatz, which are taken to keep $M_{\mu\tau}/M_{\mu\mu}$ = $-

connect CP violating phases with phases of flavor neutrino masses, which are

result, we obtain a general definition of knowledge in terms of belief that
enables us to view S5-knowledge as accurate (unbiased and thus true)

S5-knowledge, respectively, and perfect S5-knowledge as precise (exact and

cooperative network of caches at end-nodes. The caches could be, for example,
within the computers of users downloading videos from websites (such as
Netflix, Blockbuster etc.), DVRs (such as TiVo, or cable boxes) used as part of
video on demand services or public hot-spots (e.g. Wi-Fi access points with a
cache) deployed over a city to serve content to mobile users. Each cache serves
user requests locally over a medium that incurs no additional costs (i.e. WiFi,
home LAN); if a request is not cached, it must be fetched from another cache or
a central server. In our model, each cache has a tiered back-haul internet
connection, with a usage cap (and fixed per-byte costs thereafter). Redirecting
requests intended for the central server to other caches with unused back-haul
capacity can bring down the network costs. Our goal is to develop a mechanism
to optimally 1) place data into the caches and 2) route requests to caches to
reduce the overall cost of content delivery.
  We develop a multi-criteria approximation based on a LP rounding procedure
that with a small (constant factor) blow-up in storage and upload limits of
each cache, gives a data placement that is within constant factor of the
optimum. Further, to speed up the solution, we propose a technique to cluster
caches into groups, solve the data placement problem within a group, and
combine the results in the rounding phase to get the global solution.Based on
extensive simulations, we show that our schemes perform very well in practice,
giving costs within $5--15$% to the optimal, and reducing the network load at a
central server by as much as 55% with only a marginal blow up in the limits.
Also we demonstrate that our approach out-performs a non-cooperative caching
mechanism by about 20%.

orders of magnitude higher than those expected in the case of ad-atoms which
have thermalized with the surface. This paper addresses the issue of a possible
thermodynamic characterization of the adlayer under reactive conditions and at
the steady state. In turn, this implies to tackle the question of determining
the temperature of the ad-atoms. This is done by means of a nonequilibrium
statistical thermodynamic approach, by exploiting a suitable definition of the
entropy. The interplay between reaction rate, vibrational temperature of the
ad-atoms and adsorbed quantities is highlighted. It is shown that the
vibrational temperature depends on reaction rate logarithmically and exhibits a
non-linear scaling on physical quantities linked to the energetics of the
reaction, namely the adsorption energy and the binding energy of the molecule.
The present modeling is also discussed in connection with response equations of
nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

the external radiation assumed to turn on when the filamentary cloud forms, the
filamentary cloud with low initial density ($n_0 \le 10^2 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$)
suffers photodissociation of hydrogen molecules. In such a case, since main
coolant is lost, temperature increases adiabatically enough to suppress
collapse. As a result, the filamentary cloud fragments into very massive clouds
($\sim 10^5 M_\odot$). On the other hand, the evolution of the filamentary
clouds with high initial density ($n_0>10^2 \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) is hardly
affected by the external radiation. This is because the filamentary cloud with
high initial density shields itself from the external radiation. It is found
that the external radiation increases fragment mass. This result is consistent
with previous results with one-zone models. It is also found that fragment mass
decreases owing to the external dissociation radiation in the case with
sufficiently large line mass.

supernovae (SNe Ic) 2002ap and 2007gr, showing a rapid rise to a radio peak
within ~ 10 days reaching to a low luminosity (at least an order of magnitude
fainter than a majority of SNe IIb/Ib/Ic). They show a decline after the peak
shallower than others while the spectral index is similar. We show that all
these properties are naturally explained if the circumstellar material (CSM)
density is low and therefore the forward shock is expanding into the CSM
without deceleration. Since the forward shock velocity in this situation, as
estimated from the radio properties, still records the maximum velocity of the
SN ejecta following the shock breakout, observing these SNe in radio
wavelengths provides new diagnostics on natures of the breakout and progenitor
which otherwise requires a quite rapid follow-up in other wavelengths. The
inferred post-shock breakout velocities of SNe Ic 2002ap and 2007gr are
sub-relativistic, ~0.3c. These are higher than inferred for SN II 1987A, in
line with suggested compact progenitors. However, these are lower than expected
for a Wolf-Rayet (WR) progenitor. It may reflect a still-unresolved nature of
the progenitors just before the explosion, and we suggest that the WR
progenitor envelopes might have been inflated which could quickly reduce the
maximum ejecta velocity from the initial shock breakout velocity.

that a set of receptors with fixed parameters can encode functionally unique

components of primeval galaxies, the sources of cosmic chemical enrichment and
likely cosmic reionization, and they possibly gave rise to the supermassive
black holes residing at the centres of galaxies today. While the direct
detection of individual Pop III stars will likely remain beyond reach for
decades to come, we show their supernova remnants may soon be detectable in the
radio. We calculate radio synchrotron signatures between 0.5 - 35 GHz from
hydrodynamical computations of the supernova remnants of Pop III stars in
minihaloes. We find that hypernovae yield the brightest systems, with observed
radio fluxes as high as 1 - 10 muJy. Less energetic Type II supernovae yield
remnants about a factor of 30 dimmer and pair-instability supernova remnants
are dimmer by a factor of more than 10,000. Because of the high gas densities
of the progenitor environments, synchrotron losses severely limit the maximum
emission frequencies, producing a distinctive peaked radio spectrum
distinguishable from normal galactic supernova remnant spectra. Hypernovae
radio remnants should be detectable by existing radio facilities like eVLA and
eMERLIN while Type II supernova remnants will require the Square Kilometre
Array. The number counts of hypernova remnants at z > 20 with fluxes above 1
muJy are expected to be one per hundred square degree field, increasing to a
few per square degree if they form down to z = 10. The detection of a z > 20
Type II supernova remnant brighter than 1 nJy would require a 100 - 200 square
degree field, although only a 1 - 2 square degree field for those forming down
to z = 10. Hypernova and Type II supernova remnants are easily separated from
one another by their light curves, which will enable future surveys to use them
to constrain the initial mass function of Pop III stars.

graphically extracted from time-of-flight (ToF) photocurrent transients
yielding a single transit time. However, the term transit time is ambiguously
defined and fails to deliver a mobility in terms of a statistical average.
Here, we introduce an advanced computational procedure to evaluate ToF
transients, which allows to extract the whole distribution of transit times and
mobilities from the photocurrent transient, instead of a single value. This
method, extending the work of Scott et al. (Phys. Rev. B 46, 8603), is
applicable to disordered systems with a Gaussian density of states (DOS) and
its accuracy is validated using one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations. We
demonstrate the superiority of this new approach by comparing it to the common
geometrical analysis of hole ToF transients measured on poly(3-hexyl
thiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT). The extracted distributions provide access to a
very detailed and accurate analysis of the charge carrier transport. For
instance, not only the mobility given by the mean transit time, but also the
mean mobility can be calculated. Whereas the latter determines the macroscopic
photocurrent, the former is relevant for an accurate determination of the
energetic disorder parameter $\sigma$ within the Gaussian disorder model (GDM).
$\sigma$ derived by using the common geometrical method is, as we show,
underestimated instead.

Although this appears a limitation, here we show how four heuristics lead to
sustainable growth by exploiting specific environmental constraints. The two
simplest ones --contribute permanently or switch stochastically between
contributing or not-- are first shown to bring sustainability when the public
good efficiently promotes growth. If efficiency declines and the commons is
structured in small groups, the most effective strategy resides in contributing
only when a majority of individuals are also contributors. In contrast, when
group size becomes large, the most effective behavior follows a minimal-effort

are observed in natural systems what presents them as fundamental social motifs

cluster size $S$. From the measured $P_{\infty}$ and $S$ we obtain the critical
exponents $\beta_k$ and $\gamma_k$ for $k=2$ and 3. Here $\beta_k$ and
$\gamma_k$ are the critical exponents for $P_\infty$ and $S$ when the growth of
clusters spontaneously breaks the $Z_k$ symmetry of the $k$-partite graph (Lau,
Paczuski, and Grassberger, 2012). The obtained values are $\beta_2=1.79(3)$,
$\gamma_2=0.88(1)$, $\beta_3=1.35(5)$, and $\gamma_3=0.94(2)$. By comparing
these values of exponents with those for ordinary percolation
($\beta_{\infty}=1$ and $\gamma_{\infty}=1$) we also find the inequalities
between the exponents, as $\beta_\infty<\beta_3<\beta_2$ and
$\gamma_\infty>\gamma_3>\gamma_2$. These results quantitatively verify the
conjecture that the AP model belongs to a new universality class if $Z_k$

artificial dissipation for stability in the majority of methods. The price to
pay is the appearance of trailing tails, amplitude damping, and delays as the
solution evolves. These undesirable effects can be corrected by properly
counterbalancing two sources of artificial dissipation; this procedure is
designed by using the slow time evolution of the parameters of the solitary
waves under the presence of the dissipation determined by means of adiabatic
perturbation methods. The validity of the tail removal methodology is
demonstrated on a Pad\'e numerical scheme. The tails are completely removed
leaving only a small compact ripple at the original position of their front,
and the numerical stability of the scheme under compacton collisions is
preserved, as shown by extensive numerical experiments for several values of n.

negative energy pockets examined in the 60s by Sarma, where they principally
differ from the latter in their non-degenerate energy bands due to the absence
of the time reversal symmetry. They respect a disk or a shell-topology in
$k$-space or a mixture between them depending on the B-field strength and the

hence to thermal distortions of the laser beam profile, which sets a limit on
the maximal light power employable in GW observatories. Here, we propose and
realize a Michelson-type laser interferometer with arm resonators whose
coupling components are all-reflective second-order Littrow gratings. In
principle such gratings allow high finesse values of the resonators but avoid
bulk transmission of the laser light and thus the corresponding thermal beam

creation of a second signal port. We theoretically analyze the signal response
of the proposed topology and show that it is equivalent to a conventional
Michelson-type interferometer. In our proof-of-principle experiment we
generated phase-modulation signals inside the arm resonators and detected them
simultaneously at the two signal ports. The sum signal was shown to be
equivalent to a single-output-port Michelson interferometer with
transmissively-coupled arm cavities, taking into account optical loss. The
proposed and demonstrated topology is a possible approach for future

applying the q-averages to the density, Hubble expansion and spatial curvature

and non-local fluctuations and perturbations with respect to the q-average
convey the effects of inhomogeneity through the ratio of curvature and
kinematic invariants and the magnitude of radial gradients. All curvature and
kinematic proper tensors that characterize the models are expressible as
irreducible algebraic expansions on the metric and 4-velocity, whose
coefficients are the q-scalars and their linear and quadratic local
fluctuations. All invariant contractions of these tensors are quadratic
fluctuations, whose q-averages are directly and exactly related to statistical
correlation moments of the density and Hubble expansion scalar. We explore the
application of this formalism to a definition of a gravitational entropy
functional proposed by Hosoya et al (2004 Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 141302). We show
that a positive entropy production follows from a negative correlation between
fluctuations of the density and Hubble scalar, providing a brief outline on its

specially suited for LTB and Szekeres models, it may provide a valuable

in recent years. They provide means to improve the convergence speed of these

common approach for the construction of deflation subspaces is to use
(approximate) eigenvectors, but also more general subspaces are applicable.
  In this paper we discuss two results concerning the accuracy requirements

deflation subspace. Second, we discuss the accuracy required in calculating the
deflating projection. This is crucial concerning the overall convergence of the
method, and also allows to save some computational work.
  To show these results, we use the fact that as a projection approach
deflation has many similarities to multigrid methods. In particular, recent
results relate the spectra of the deflated matrix to the spectra of the error
propagator of twogrid methods. In the spirit of these results we show that the
effective condition number can be bounded by the constant of a weak

CO2 and N2 agree well with experimental data over a wide range of temperatures.
These diagrams are computed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MC) method
based on the Gibbs-NVT ensemble. This good agreement validates the proposed
simplified models. That is, with properly selected parameters, the
single-particle models have similar accuracy in predicting gas-phase properties
as more complex, state-of-the-art molecular models. To further test these
single-particle models, three binary mixtures of CH4, CO2 and N2 are studied

data over a wide range of pressures. The single-particle model has similar
accuracy in the gas phase as traditional models although its deviation in the
liquid phase is greater. The simplified model improves the computational
efficiency significantly, particularly in the case of high liquid density where
the acceptance rate of the particle-swap trial move increases. The MC method
based on Gibbs-NVT ensemble is a viable alternative to simulate
phase-coexistence of fluid mixtures. We compare, at constant temperature and

Coulomb gauges in space-time dimension 2, 3, and 4 pose a challenge to the
Gribov confinement scenario.
  We prove, without approximation, that for these gauges, the continuum gluon
propagator $D(k)$ in SU(N) gauge theory satisfies the bound ${d-1 \over d} {1
\over (2 \pi)^d} \int d^dk {D(k) \over k^2} \leq N$. This holds for Landau
gauge, in which case $d$ is the dimension of space-time, and for Coulomb gauge,
in which case $d$ is the dimension of ordinary space and $D(k)$ is the
instantaneous spatial gluon propagator. This bound implies that $\lim_{k \to
0}k^{d-2} D(k) = 0$, where $D(k)$ is the gluon propagator at momentum $k$, and
consequently $D(0) = 0$ in Landau gauge in space-time $d = 2$, and in Coulomb
gauge in space dimension $d = 2$, but D(0) may be finite in higher dimension.
These results are compatible with numerical studies of the Landau-and
Coulomb-gauge propagator.
  In 4-dimensional space-time a regularization is required, and we also prove
an analogous bound on the lattice gluon propagator, ${1 \over d (2 \pi)^d}

infinite-volume limit of lattice gauge theory at fixed lattice spacing, and the
lattice momentum componant $k_\mu$ is a continuous angle $- \pi \leq k_\mu \leq
\pi$. Unexpectedly, this implies a bound on the {\it high-momentum} behavior of
the continuum propagator in minimum Landau and Coulomb gauge in 4 space-time
dimensions which, moreover, is compatible with the perturbative renormalization

BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer)-BEC (Bose-Einstein condensation) crossover
regime of an ultracold Fermi gas. Recently, Liu and Hu, and Parish, pointed out
that the strong-coupling theory developed by Nozi\`eres and Schmitt-Rink (NSR),
which has been extensively used to successfully clarify various physical
properties of cold Fermi gases, unphysically gives negative spin susceptibility
in the BCS-BEC crossover region. The same problem is found to also exist in the
ordinary non-self-consistent T-matrix approximation. In this paper, we clarify
that this serious problem comes from incomplete treatment in term of pseudogap
phenomena originating from strong pairing fluctuations, as well as effects of
spin fluctuations on the spin susceptibility. Including these two key issues,
we construct an extended T-matrix theory which can overcome this problem. The
resulting positive spin susceptibility agrees well with the recent experiment
on a 6Li Fermi gas done by Sanner and co-workers. We also apply our theory to a
polarized Fermi gas to examine the superfluid phase transition temperature Tc,
as a function of the polarization rate. Since the spin susceptibility is an
important physical quantity, especially in singlet Fermi superfluids, our
results would be useful in considering how singlet pairs appear above and below
Tc in the BCS-BEC crossover regime of cold Fermi gases.

Plate Chambers (RPC). They mainly serve as trigger detectors and also improve
the reconstruction of muon parameters. Over the years, the instantaneous
luminosity of the Large Hadron Collider gradually increases. During the LHC
Phase 1 (~first 10 years of operation) an ultimate luminosity is expected above
its design value of 10^34/cm^2/s at 14 TeV. To prepare the machine and also the
experiments for this, two long shutdown periods are scheduled for 2013-2014 and
2018-2019. The CMS Collaboration is planning several detector upgrades during
these long shutdowns. In particular, the muon detection system should be able
to maintain a low-pT threshold for an efficient Level-1 Muon Trigger at high
particle rates. One of the measures to ensure this, is to extend the present
RPC system with the addition of a 4th layer in both endcap regions. During the
first long shutdown, these two new stations will be equipped in the region
|eta|<1.6 with 144 High Pressure Laminate (HPL) double-gap RPCs operating in
avalanche mode, with a similar design as the existing CMS endcap chambers.
Here, we present the upgrade plans for the CMS RPC system for the fist long

sufficient to reconstruct light curves for arbitrary explosion energy,
circumburst density and synchrotron slope p. We compare our light curves to fit

difference in temporal indices across the jet break is larger than
theoretically anticipated leading to post-break slopes of roughly 0.25 - 1.3 p,
sufficiently steep to not easily reconcile with post-break slopes measured for

standoff distance, Sd, as a fraction of the CME radial half-width, Dob (i.e.
Sd/Dob). Previous hydrodynamic studies have related the shock standoff distance
for Earths magnetosphere to the density compression ratio (DR,Ru/Rd) measured
across the bow shock (Spreiter, Summers and Alksne 1966). The DR coefficient,
kdr, which is the proportionality constant between the relative standoff
distance (Sd/Dob) and the compression ratio, was semi-empirically estimated as
1.1. For CMEs, we show that this value varies linearly as a function of
heliocentric distance and changes significantly for different radii of
curvature of the CMEs leading edge. We find that a value of 0.8+-0.1 is more
appropriate for small heliocentric distances (<30Rs) which corresponds to the
spherical geometry of a magnetosphere presented by Seiff (1962). As the CME
propagates its cross section becomes more oblate and the kdr value increases
linearly with heliocentric distance, such that kdr= 1.1 is most appropriate at
a heliocentric distance of about 80Rs. For terrestrial distances (215Rs) we
estimate kdr= 1.8+-0.3, which also indicates that the CME cross-sectional
structure is generally more oblate than that of Earths magnetosphere. These
alterations to the proportionality coefficients may serve to improve
investigations into the estimates of the magnetic field in the corona upstream
of a CME as well as the aspect ratio of CMEs as measured in situ.

due to the inherent tendency of the impurities to accumulate in the core when
the neoclassical ambipolar radial electric field points radially inwards (ion
root regime). This accumulation can lead to collapse of the plasma due to
radiative losses, and thus limit high performance plasma discharges in
non-axisymmetric devices.\\ A quantitative description of the neoclassical
impurity transport is complicated by the breakdown of the assumption of small
$\mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{B}$ drift and trapping due to the electrostatic
potential variation on a flux surface $\tilde{\Phi}$ compared to those due to
the magnetic field gradient. The present work examines the impact of this
potential variation on neoclassical impurity transport in the Large Helical
Device (LHD) stellarator. It shows that the neoclassical impurity transport can
be strongly affected by $\tilde{\Phi}$. The central numerical tool used is the
$\delta f$ particle in cell (PIC) Monte Carlo code EUTERPE. The $\tilde{\Phi}$
used in the calculations is provided by the neoclassical code GSRAKE. The

of a galaxy depend on the local density out to distances of a few Megaparsecs.
In this paper, we compare the environmental density dependence of the atomic
gas mass fractions of nearby galaxies with the density dependence of their
central and global specific star formation rates. We stack HI line spectra
extracted from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey centered on galaxies with UV
imaging from GALEX and optical imaging/spectroscopy from SDSS. We use these
stacked spectra to evaluate the mean atomic gas mass fraction of galaxies in
bins of stellar mass and local density. For galaxies with stellar masses less
than 10^10.5 M_sun, the decline in mean atomic gas mass fraction with density
is stronger than the decline in mean global and central specific star formation
rate. The same conclusion does not hold for more massive galaxies. We interpret
our results as evidence for ram-pressure stripping of atomic gas from the outer
disks of low mass satellite galaxies. We compare our results with the
semi-analytic recipes of Guo et al. (2011) implemented on the Millennium II
simulation. These models assume that only the diffuse gas surrounding satellite
galaxies is stripped, a process that is often termed ""strangulation"". We show
that these models predict relative trends in atomic gas and star formation that
are in disagreement with observations. We use mock catalogues generated from
the simulation to predict the halo masses of the HI-deficient galaxies in our
sample. We conclude that ram-pressure stripping is likely to become effective
in dark matter halos with masses greater than 10^13 M_sun.

guide field and for increasing Reynolds number. The presented simulations, with
numerical resolutions up to 2048^3 mesh points and statistics accumulated over
30 to 150 eddy turnover times, constitute, to the best of our knowledge, the
largest statistical sample of steady state MHD turbulence to date. We study
both the balanced case, where the energies associated with Alfv\'en modes
propagating in opposite directions along the guide field, E^+ and $E^-, are
equal, and the imbalanced case where the energies are different. In the
balanced case, we find that the energy spectrum converges to a power law with
exponent -3/2 as the Reynolds number is increased, consistent with
phenomenological models that include scale-dependent dynamic alignment. For the
imbalanced case, with E^+>E^-, the simulations show that E^- ~ k_{\perp}^{-3/2}
for all Reynolds numbers considered, while E^+ has a slightly steeper spectrum
at small Re. As the Reynolds number increases, E^+ flattens. Since both E^+ and
E^- are pinned at the dissipation scale and anchored at the driving scales, we
postulate that at sufficiently high Re the spectra will become parallel in the
inertial range and scale as E^+ ~ E^- ~ k_{\perp}^{-3/2}. Questions regarding

restrict the use of smoothing spline in practical statistical work. Firstly, it
becomes computationally prohibitive for large data sets because the number of
basis functions roughly equals the sample size. Secondly, its global smoothing
parameter can only provide constant amount of smoothing, which often results in
poor performances when estimating inhomogeneous functions. In this work, we
introduce a class of adaptive smoothing spline models that is derived by
solving certain stochastic differential equations with finite element methods.
The solution extends the smoothing parameter to a continuous data-driven
function, which is able to capture the change of the smoothness of underlying
process. The new model is Markovian, which makes Bayesian computation fast. A

manifolds, but with a linear side condition, where more structure is available.
We show that the requirement of $N-1$ commuting second-order symmetry
operators, modulo a second-order linear side condition corresponds to
nonregular separation of variables in an orthogonal coordinate system,
characterized by a generalized St\""ackel matrix. The coordinates and solutions
obtainable through true nonregular separation are distinct from those arising
through regular separation of variables. We develop the theory for these
systems and provide examples.

estimates for heating and quadrature thermal noise squeezing near and below the
transition line of the first parametric instability zone of the oscillator are
given. Furthermore, we give an intuitive explanation as to why heating and
thermal squeezing occur. For small amplitudes of the parametric pump the
Floquet multipliers are complex conjugate of each other with a constant
magnitude. As the pump amplitude is increased past a threshold value in the
stable zone near the first parametric instability, the two Floquet multipliers
become real and have different magnitudes. This creates two different effective
dissipation rates (one smaller and the other larger than the real dissipation
rate) along the stable manifolds of the first-return Poincare map. We also show
that the statistical average of the input power due to thermal noise is
constant and independent of the pump amplitude and frequency. The combination
of these effects cause most of heating and thermal squeezing. Very good
agreement between analytical and numerical estimates of the thermal
fluctuations is achieved.

of the presence of a neutron star in the system. When the pulsations are missed
in the radio band, their detection at other wavelengths, like X-ray or
gamma-rays, requires orbital demodulation, since the length of the observations
are often comparable to, or longer than the system orbital period. The detailed
knowledge of the orbital parameters of binary systems plays a crucial role in
the detection of the spin period of pulsars, since any uncertainty in their
determination translates into a loss in the coherence of the signal during the
demodulation process. In this paper, we present an analytical study aimed at
unveiling how the uncertainties in the orbital parameters might impact on
periodicity searches. We find a correlation between the power of the signal in
the demodulated arrival time series and the uncertainty in each of the orbital
parameters. This correlation is also a function of the pulsar frequency. We
test our analytical results with numerical simulations, finding good agreement
between them. Finally, we apply our study to the cases of LS 5039 and LS I +61
303 and consider the current level of uncertainties in the orbital parameters
of these systems and their impact on a possible detection of a hosted pulsar.
We also discuss the possible appearance of a sideband ambiguity in real data.
The latter can occur when, due to the use of uncertain orbital parameters, the
power of a putative pulsar is distributed in frequencies lying nearby the
pulsar period. Even if the appearance of a sideband is already a signature of a
pulsar component, it may introduce an ambiguity in the determination of its
period. We present here a method to solve the sideband issue.

independently with probability $p \in (0,1]$. For $p=1$, this coincides with
the standard Abelian sandpile model. In general, for $p\in(0,1)$, the set of
recurrent configurations of this sandpile model is different from that of the
Abelian sandpile model. We give a characterisation of this set in terms of
orientations of the graph $G$. We also define the lacking polynomial $L_G$ as
the generating function counting this set according to the number of grains,
and show that this polynomial satisfies a recurrence which resembles that of
the Tutte polynomial.

dynamics in a driven double quantum dot (DQD) including dephasing and,
importantly, energy relaxation due to environmental fluctuations. We derive
effective nonequilibrium Bloch equations. These allow us to identify clear
signatures for LZS oscilations observed but not recognized as such in
experiments [Petersson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 246804, 2010] and to
identify the full environmental fluctuation spectra acting on a DQD given
experimental data as in [Petersson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 105, 246804, 2010].
Herein we find that super-Ohmic fluctuations, typically due to phonons, are the
main relaxation channel for a detuned DQD whereas Ohmic fluctuations dominate
at zero detuning.

environments: clusters, filaments, walls and voids. This is a multiscale and
automatic morphological analysis tool that identifies all the cosmic structures
in a scale free way, without preference for a certain size or shape. We develop
the NEXUS method to incorporate the density, tidal field, velocity divergence
and velocity shear as tracers of the Cosmic Web. We also present the NEXUS+
procedure which, taking advantage of a novel filtering of the density in
logarithmic space, is very successful at identifying the filament and wall
environments in a robust and natural way. To asses the algorithms we apply them
to an N-body simulation. We find that all methods correctly identify the most
prominent filaments and walls, while there are differences in the detection of
the more tenuous structures. In general, the structures traced by the density
and tidal fields are clumpier and more rugged than those present in the
velocity divergence and velocity shear fields. We find that the NEXUS+ method
captures much better the filamentary and wall networks and is successful in
detecting even the fainter structures. We also confirm the efficiency of our
methods by examining the dark matter particle and halo distributions.

solar wind acceleration. Here we investigate the dissipation of such waves due
to phase mixing at the presence of shear flow and field in the stratified
atmosphere of solar spicules. The initial flow is assumed to be directed along
spicule axis and to vary linearly in the x direction and the equilibrium
magnetic field is taken 2-dimensional and divergence-free. It is determined
that the shear flow and field can fasten the damping of standing Alfven waves.
In spite of propagating Alfven waves, standing Alfven waves in Solar spicules
dissipate in a few periods. As height increases, the perturbed velocity
amplitude does increase in contrast to the behavior of perturbed magnetic
field. Moreover, it should be emphasized that the stratification due to
gravity, shear flow and field are the facts that should be considered in MHD
models in spicules.

wind-drivers among the dust species observed in circumstellar envelopes. In
particular, we focus on the interplay between a strong stellar radiation field
and the dust formation process. To identify critical properties of potential
wind-driving dust species we use detailed radiation-hydrodynamical models which
include a parameterized dust description, complemented by simple analytical
estimates to help with the physical interpretation of the numerical results.
The adopted dust description is constructed to mimic different chemical and
optical dust properties in order to systematically study the effects of a
realistic radiation field on the second stage of the mass loss mechanism. We
see distinct trends in which combinations of optical and chemical dust
properties are needed to trigger an outflow. Dust species with a low
condensation temperature and a NIR absorption coefficient that decreases
strongly with wavelength will not condense close enough to the stellar surface
to be considered as potential wind-drivers. Our models confirm that metallic
iron and Fe-bearing silicates are not viable as wind-drivers due to their
near-infrared optical properties and resulting large condensation distances.
TiO2 is also excluded as a wind-driver due to the low abundance of Ti. Other
species, such a SiO2 and Al2O3, are less clear-cut cases due to uncertainties
in the optical and chemical data and further work is needed. A strong candidate
is Mg2SiO4 with grain sizes of 0.1-1 micron, where scattering contributes
significantly to the radiative acceleration, as suggested by earlier
theoretical work and supported by recent observations.

We contrast this

diminishing returns, at least regarding established fields. In order to
stimulate a larger discussion, we investigate two exemplary cases, the linear
increase in human life expectancy over the last 170 years and the advances in
the reliability of numerical short and medium term weather predictions during
the last 50 years. We argue that the outcome of science and technology (S&T)
funding in terms of measurable results is a highly sub-linear function of the
amount of resources committed. Supporting a range of small to medium size
research projects, instead of a few large ones, will be, as a corollary, a more
efficient use of resources for science funding agencies.
