that in the presence of the quasar s the comoving HII bubble radii reach 10
Mpc/h after 20 My while with the stellar component alone the HII bubbles are
smaller by at least an order of magnitude. Our calculations show that several
features are not captured within an analytical growth model of Stromgren
spheres. The X-ray photons from hard quasar spectra drive a smooth transition
from fully neutral to partially neutral in the ionization front. However the
transition from partially neutral to fully ionized is significantly more
complex. We measure the distance to the edge of bubbles as a function of angle
and use the standard deviation of these distances as a diagnostic of the
isotropy of ionized regions. We find that the overlapping of nearby ionized
regions from clustered halos not only increases the anisotropy, but also is the
main mechanism which allows the outer radius to grow. We therefore predict that
quasar ionized bubbles at this early stage in the reionization process should
be both significantly larger and more irregularly shaped than bubbles around
star forming galaxies. Before the star formation rate increases and the
Universe fully reionizes, quasar bubbles will form the most striking and
recognizable features in 21cm maps.

the comparison of PD between samples of different depth. One approach to
dealing with differing sample depth for a given diversity statistic is to
rarefy, which means to take a random subset of a given size of the original
sample. Exact analytical formulae for the mean and variance of species richness
under rarefaction have existed for some time but no such solution exists for
PD. We have derived exact formulae for the mean and variance of PD under
rarefaction. We show that these formulae are correct by comparing exact
solution mean and variance to that calculated by repeated random (Monte Carlo)
subsampling of a dataset of stem counts of woody shrubs of Toohey Forest,
Queensland, Australia. We also demonstrate the application of the method using
two examples: identifying hotspots of mammalian diversity in Australasian
ecoregions, and characterising the human vaginal microbiome. There is a very
high degree of correspondence between the analytical and random subsampling
methods for calculating mean and variance of PD under rarefaction, although the
Monte Carlo method requires a large number of random draws to converge on the
exact solution for the variance. Rarefaction of mammalian PD of ecoregions in
Australasia to a common standard of 25 species reveals very different rank
orderings of ecoregions, indicating quite different hotspots of diversity than
those obtained for unrarefied PD. The application of these methods to the
vaginal microbiome shows that a classical score used to quantify bacterial
vaginosis is correlated with the shape of the rarefaction curve. The analytical
formulae for the mean and variance of PD under rarefaction are both exact and
more efficient than repeated subsampling. Rarefaction of PD allows for many
applications where comparisons of samples of different depth is required.

artificial spin ice on a square lattice in two dimensions. Each island of the
spin ice has a three-component Heisenberg-like dipole moment subject to shape
anisotropies that influence its direction. The model has real dynamics,
including rotation of the magnetic degrees of freedom, going beyond the
Ising-type models of spin ice. The dynamics is studied using a Langevin
equation solved via a second order Heun algorithm. Thermodynamic properties
such as the specific heat are presented for different couplings. A peak in
specific heat is related to a type of melting-like phase transition present in
the model. Hysteresis in an applied magnetic field is calculated for model
parameters where the system is able to reach thermodynamic equilibrium.

numerical technique to find instantons that satisfy classicality. In the
stochastic approach, we introduce the probability distribution of Hubble
patches that can be approximated by locally homogeneous universes down to a
smoothing scale. We assume that the ground state wave function should
correspond to the stationary state of the probability distribution of the
stochastic universe. By comparing the dispersion of both approaches, we
conclude three main results. (1) For a statistical distribution with a certain
value, we can find a corresponding instanton in the Euclidean side, and it
should be a complex-valued instanton. (2) The size of the universe of the
Euclidean approach corresponds to the smoothing scale of the stochastic side;
the universe is homogeneous up to the Euclidean instanton. (3) In addition, as
the mass increases up to a critical value, both approaches break at the same
time. Hence, generation of classical inhomogeneity in the stochastic approach
and the instability of classicality in the Euclidean approach are related.

transitive Lie algebroid as an element of the object of a homotopy functor.
Roughly speaking each transitive Lie algebroids can be described as a vector
bundle over the tangent bundle of the manifold which is endowed with additional
structures. Therefore transitive Lie algebroids admits a construction of
inverse image generated by a smooth mapping of smooth manifolds. Due to to
K.Mackenzie (2005) the construction can be managed as a homotopy functor
$\mathcal{TLA}_{\rg}$ from category of smooth manifolds to the transitive Lie
algebroids. The functor $\mathcal{TLA}_{\rg}$ associates with each smooth
manifold $M$ the set $\mathcal{TLA}_{\rg}(M)$ of all transitive algebroids with
fixed structural finite dimensional Lie algebra $\rg$. Hence one can construct
a classifying space $\cB_{\rg}$ such that the family of all transitive Lie
algebroids with fixed Lie algebra $\rg$ over the manifold $M$ has one-to-one
correspondence with the family of homotopy classes of continuous maps
$[M,\cB_{\rg}]$: $\mathcal{TLA}_{\rg}(M)\approx [M,\cB_{\rg}].$
  It allows to describe characteristic classes of transitive Lie algebroids
from the point of view a natural transformation of functors similar to the
classical abstract characteristic classes for vector bundles and to compare
them with that derived from the Chern-Weil homomorphism by J.Kubarski. As a
matter of fact we show that the Chern-Weil homomorphism does not cover all
characteristic classes from categorical point of view.

We provide an approach that eliminates possible unphysical contributions from
the vacuum polarization and renders the resulting photon spectra integrable

order in the perturbative coupling constants while a thermal production is only
of quartic order. Quantitatively, we find, however, that for the most physical

(polarised deuterons) during the years of 2002-2006 and NH$_{3}$ (polarised

Photon Gluon Fusion (PGF) process. Among the channels studied by COMPASS, the
production of charmed mesons is the one that tags a PGF interaction in the most
clean and efficient way. This talk presents a result for the gluon
polarisation, $\Delta g/g$, which is based on a measurement of the spin
asymmetry resulting from the production of D$^{0}$ mesons. These mesons are
reconstructed through the invariant mass of their decay products. The
statistical significance of the $D^{0}$ mass spectra has been improved
significantly using a new method based on Neural Networks. The $\Delta g/g$
result is also presented using a next-to-leading order (NLO-QCD) analysis of
the $\mu N \rightarrow q\bar{q}$ reaction. Such correction is relevant and was
for the first time applied to an experimental measurement of the gluon
polarisation.

the limiting probability distributions are zero and one for all $x$.
  The proof yields also a complete characterization of random distributions
that lead to fiducial distributions.
  The paper also treats intersecting distributions and non-intersecting
incomplete distributions. The latter, which are frequently encountered in a
null hypothesis, are shown to be associated with intersecting ""composite""
distributions.

construct analytic expressions for the emissivity of this surface as functions

calculate X-ray spectra for neutron stars with condensed iron surfaces covered

function of the baryon number charge density operator and the associated peaks
in the spectral function. We focus on the evolution of the collective
excitations as we increase the frequency relative to T, i.e. the
hydrodynamic/collisionless crossover. We find that for all B, at low
frequencies the tallest peak in the spectral function is associated with
hydrodynamic charge diffusion. At high frequencies the tallest peak is
associated with a sound mode similar to the zero sound mode in the
collisionless regime of a Landau Fermi liquid. The sound mode has a gap
proportional to B, and as a result for intermediate frequencies and for B
sufficiently large compared to T the spectral function is strongly suppressed.
We find that the hydrodynamic/collisionless crossover occurs at a frequency
that is approximately B-independent.

We propose new estimators for the residual variance, the l2-signal strength,

high-dimensional linear models with Gaussian predictors and errors, where the
number of predictors d is proportional to the number of observations n.
Existing results on residual variance estimation in high-dimensional linear
models depend on sparsity in the underlying signal. Our results require no

protoplanetary disks. Observations of these objects show that the growth of
primordial sub micron sized particles into larger aggregates occurs at the
earliest stages of the disks. However, theoretical models of particle growth
that use the Smoluchowski equation to describe collisional coagulation and
fragmentation have so far failed to produce large particles while maintaining a
significant populations of small grains. This has been generally attributed to
the existence of two barriers impeding growth due to bouncing and fragmentation
of colliding particles. In this paper, we demonstrate that the importance of
these barriers has been artificially inflated through the use of simplified
models that do not take into account the stochastic nature of the particle
motions within the gas disk. We present a new approach in which the relative
velocities between two particles is described by a probability distribution
function that models both deterministic motion and stochastic motion. Taking
both into account can give quite different results to what has been considered
recently in other studies. We demonstrate the vital effect of two ""ingredients""
for particle growth: the proper implementation of a velocity distribution
function that overcomes the bouncing barrier and, in combination with mass
transfer in high-mass-ratio collisions, boosts the growth of larger particles
beyond the fragmentation barrier. A robust result of our simulations is the
emergence of two particle populations (small and large), potentially explaining
simultaneously a number of long-standing problems in protoplanetary disks,
including planetesimal formation close to the central star, the presence of mm
to cm size particles far out in the disk, and the persistence of micron-size
grains for millions of years.

curves with no bump however exist and are, with no exception, linear from the
near-infrared down to 2500 A at least, often over all the visible-UV spectrum.
The duality linear versus bump-like extinction curves can be used to
re-investigate the relationship between the bump and the continuum of
interstellar extinction, and answer questions as why do we observe two
different kinds of extinction (linear or with a bump) in interstellar clouds?
How are they related? How does the existence of two different extinction laws
fits with the requirement that extinction curves depend exclusively on the
reddening E(B-V) and on a single additional parameter? What is this free
parameter?
  It will be found that (1) interstellar dust models, which suppose the
existence of three different types of particles, each contributing to the
extinction in a specific wavelength range, fail to account for the
observations; (2) the 2200 A bump is very unlikely to be absorption by some yet
unidentified molecule; (3) the true law of interstellar extinction must be
linear from the visible to the far-UV, and is the same for all directions,
including other galaxies.
  In extinction curves with a bump the excess of starlight (or the lack of
extinction) observed at wavelengths less than lambda=4000 A is due to a large
contribution of light scattered by hydrogen on the line of sight. Although
counter-intuitive this contribution is predicted by theory. The free parameter
of interstellar extinction is related to distances between the observer, the
cloud on the line of sight, and the star behind it (the parameter is likely to
be the ratio of the distances from the cloud to the star and to the observer).
The continuum of the extinction curve or the bump contain no information
concerning the chemical composition of interstellar cloud.

it to show that pumping by far-ultraviolet (FUV) stellar radiation previously
posited as a general explanation applies to the Orion Nebula (M42) and its
companion M43; but, it is unlikely to explain planetary nebulae and supernova
remnants. Our models establish that the observed nearly constant equivalent
width of [N I] with respect to the dust-scattered stellar continuum depends
primarily on three factors: the FUV to visual-band flux ratio of the stellar
population; the optical properties of the dust; and the line broadening where
the pumping occurs. In contrast, the intensity ratio [N I]/H{\beta} depends
primarily on the FUV to extreme-ultraviolet ratio, which varies strongly with
the spectral type of the exciting star. This is consistent with the observed
difference of a factor of five between M42 and M43, which are excited by an O7
and B0.5 star respectively. We derive a non-thermal broadening of order 5 km/s
for the [N I] pumping zone and show that the broadening mechanism must be
different from the large-scale turbulent motions that have been suggested to

  The first even surfaces of general type with $K^2=8$, $p_g=4$ and $q=0$ were
found by Oliverio as complete intersections of bidegree (6,6) in a weighted
projective space P(1,1,2,3,3).
  In this article we prove that the moduli space of even surfaces of general

hence we get a new example of generically nonreduced moduli spaces.
  Our result gives a posteriori a complete description of the half-canonical
rings of the above even surfaces. The method of proof is, we believe, the most
interesting part of the paper. After describing the graded ring of a cone we
are able, combining the explicit description of some subsets of the moduli

investigated.

bound, which puts them at risk of strong tidal heating. I first describe the
effect of eclipses on stellar illumination of satellites. Then I calculate the
orbit-averaged energy flux including illumination from the planet and tidal
heating. Habitability is defined by a scaling relation at which a moon loses
its water by the runaway greenhouse process. As a working hypothesis, orbital
stability is assumed if the moon's orbital period is less than 1/9 of the
planet's orbital period. Due to eclipses, a satellite in a close orbit can
experience a reduction in orbit-averaged stellar flux by up to about 6%. The
smaller the semi-major axis and the lower the inclination of the moon's orbit,
the stronger the reduction. I find a lower mass limit of ~0.2M_sun for exomoon
host stars to avoid the runaway greenhouse effect. Precise estimates depend on
the satellite's orbital eccentricity. Deleterious effects on exomoon
habitability may occur up to ~0.5M_sun. Although the habitable zone lies close
to low-mass stars, which allows for many transits of planet-moon binaries
within a given observation cycle, resources should not be spent to trace
habitable satellites around them. Gravitational perturbations by the star,
another planet, or another satellite induce eccentricities that likely make any
moon uninhabitable. Estimates for individual systems require dynamical
simulations that include perturbations among all bodies and tidal heating in
the satellite.

The reciprocal slope of the FIR/RC emission correlation (RC/FIR) in the SMC is
shown to be greatest in the most active star forming regions with a power law
slope of ~1.14 indicating that the RC emission increases faster than the FIR
emission. The slope of the other regions and the SMC are much flatter and in
the range of 0.63-0.85. The slopes tend to follow the thermal fractions of the
regions which range from 0.5 to 0.95. The thermal fraction of the RC emission
alone can provide the expected FIR/RC correlation. The results are consistent
with a common source for ultraviolet (UV) photons heating dust and Cosmic Ray
electrons (CRe-s) diffusing away from the star forming regions. Since the CRe-s
appear to escape the SMC so readily, the results here may not provide support

processes involving the muon, the electron and the corresponding neutrinos
which are connected by the crossing symmetry: i) the decay of muon, ii) the
inverse muon decay, and iii) the annihilation of a muon and an electron into
two neutrinos. Although the first two reactions have been observed and measured
since long ago, the third process, resulting in the invisible final state, has
never been experimentally tested. It may go either directly, or, at low
energies, via the annihilation of a muon and an electron from an atomic bound
state, called muonium (M=\mu^+e^-). The M\to \nu_\mu \nu_e decay is expected to
be a very rare process, with the branching fraction predicted to be Br(M\to
\nu_\mu\nu_e) = 6.6 10^{-12} with respect to the ordinary muon decay rate.
Using the reported experimental results on precision measurements of the
positive muon lifetime by the MuLan Collaboration, we set the first limit Br(M
\to invisible) < 5.7 10^{-6}, while still leaving a big gap of about six orders
of magnitude between this bound and the predictions. To improve substantially
the limit, we proposed to perform an experiment dedicated to the sensitive
search for the M\to invisible decay. A feasibility study of the experimental
setup shows that the sensitivity of the search for this decay mode in branching
fraction Br(M\to invisible) at the level of 10^{-12} could be achieved. If the
proposed search results in a substantially higher branching fraction than
predicted, say Br(M \to invisible) < 10^{-10}, this would unambiguously
indicate the presence of new physics. We point out that such a possibility may
occur due the muonium-mirror muonium conversion in the mirror matter model. A
result in agreement with the Standard Model prediction would be a clean check
of the pure leptonic bound state annihilation.

compensation techniques that can jointly remove the effect of these impairments
are highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a simple joint estimation and
compensation technique to estimate channel, phase noise and IQ-imbalance
parameters in MIMO-OFDM systems under multipath slow fading channels. A
subcarrier multiplexed preamble structure to estimate the channel and
impairment parameters with minimum overhead is introduced and used in the
estimation of IQ-imbalance parameters as well as the initial estimation of
effective channel matrix including common phase error (CPE). We then use a
novel tracking method based on the second order statistics of the inter-carrier
interference (ICI) and noise to update the effective channel matrix throughout
an OFDM frame. Simulation results for a variety of scenarios show that the
proposed low-complexity estimation and compensation technique can efficiently
improve the performance of MIMO-OFDM systems in terms of bit-error-rate (BER).

Planck constants can be introduced, to what extent will a semiclassical
prediction stay valid when the effective Planck constant is increased? In this
paper, we numerically study this problem, focusing on semiclassical predictions
for the decay of the quantum Loschmidt echo in deep quantum regions. Our
numerical simulations, carried out in the chaotic regime in the sawtooth model
and in the kicked rotator model and also in the critical region of a 1D Ising
chain in transverse field, show that the semiclassical predictions may work
even in deep quantum regions, in particularly, for perturbation strength in the
so-called Fermi-Golden-rule regime.

display the expected power-law scalings along with logarithmic corrections to
scaling (or cusp singularities) in certain cases. In the vicinity of some of
the intersection points the scaling behaviors change, indicating an effective
dimensional reduction; the scaling behavior near these points depends on the

exhibited by the system of two coupled large populations comprised of $N$
stochastic excitable units each is performed by studying an approximate system,
obtained by replacing each population with the corresponding mean-field model.
In the exact system, one has the units within an ensemble communicating via the
time-delayed linear couplings, whereas the inter-ensemble terms involve the
nonlinear time-delayed interaction mediated by the appropriate global
variables. The aim is to demonstrate that the bifurcations affecting the
stability of the stationary state of the original system, governed by a set of
4N stochastic delay-differential equations for the microscopic dynamics, can
accurately be reproduced by a flow containing just four deterministic
delay-differential equations which describe the evolution of the mean-field
based variables. In particular, the considered issues include determining the
parameter domains where the stationary state is stable, the scenarios for the
onset and the time-delay induced suppression of the collective mode, as well as
the parameter domains admitting bistability between the equilibrium and the
oscillatory state. We show how analytically tractable bifurcations occurring in
the approximate model can be used to identify the characteristic mechanisms by
which the stationary state is destabilized under different system
configurations, like those with symmetrical or asymmetrical inter-population
couplings.

classical and quantum theories of convolutional coding, by proving that a
quantum convolutional encoder cannot be both non-catastrophic and recursive.
Non-catastrophicity is desirable so that an iterative decoding algorithm
converges when decoding a quantum turbo code whose constituents are quantum
convolutional codes, and recursiveness is as well so that a quantum turbo code
has a minimum distance growing nearly linearly with the length of the code,
respectively. Their proof of the aforementioned theorem was admittedly ""rather
involved,"" and as such, it has been desirable since their result to find a
simpler proof. In this paper, we furnish a proof that is arguably simpler. Our
approach is group-theoretic---we show that the subgroup of memory states that
are part of a zero physical-weight cycle of a quantum convolutional encoder is
equivalent to the centralizer of its ""finite-memory"" subgroup (the subgroup of
memory states which eventually reach the identity memory state by identity
operator inputs for the information qubits and identity or Pauli-Z operator
inputs for the ancilla qubits). After proving that this symmetry holds for any
quantum convolutional encoder, it easily follows that an encoder is
non-recursive if it is non-catastrophic. Our proof also illuminates why this
no-go theorem does not apply to entanglement-assisted quantum convolutional
encoders---the introduction of shared entanglement as a resource allows the
above symmetry to be broken.

(PRV) in dayside spectra of exoplanets. To understand the spin effect
qualitatively, we derive an analytic formula of the intensity-weighted radial
velocity from planetary surface on the following assumptions: 1) constant and
solid rotation without precession, 2) stable and uniform distribution of
molecules/atoms, 3) emission models from dayside hemisphere, and 4) a circular
orbit. On these assumptions, we find that the curve of the PRV is distorted by
the planetary spin and this anomaly is characterized by spin radial velocity at
equator and a projected angle on a celestial plane between the spin axis and
the axis of orbital motion \lambda_p in a manner analogous to the
Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. The latter can constrain the planetary obliquity.
Creating mock PRV data with 3 km/s accuracy, we demonstrate how \lambda_p and
the spin radial velocity at equator are estimated. We find that the stringent
constraint of eccentricity is crucial to detect the spin effect. Though our
formula is still qualitative, we conclude that the PRV in the dayside spectra
will be a powerful means for constraining the planetary spin.
