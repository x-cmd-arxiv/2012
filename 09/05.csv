proton and neutron are encoded in the nucleon electromagnetic form factors. The
form factors are all approximated by a simple dipole function, normalized to
the charge or magnetic moment of the nucleon. The differences between the
proton and neutron form factors and the deviation of GEn from zero are
sensitive to the difference between up- and down-quark contributions to the
form factors.
  Methods: We combine recent measurements of the neutron form factors with
updated extractions of the proton form factors, accounting for two-photon
exchange corrections and including an estimate of the uncertainties for all of
the form factors to obtain a complete set of measurements up to Q^2
approximately 4 (GeV/c)^2. We use this to extract the up- and down-quark
contributions which we compare to recent fits and calculations.
  Results: We find a large differences between the up- and down-quark
contributions to G_E and G_M, implying significant flavor dependence in the
charge and magnetization distributions. The rapid falloff of the ratio GEp/GMp
does not appear in the individual quark form factors, but arises from a
cancellation between the up- and down-quark contributions. We see indications
that the down-quark contributions to the Dirac and Pauli form factors deviate
from the suggested 1/Q^4 scaling behavior suggested by a previous analysis.
Finally, while recent models provide a generally good qualitative description
of the data, the down-quark contribution to G_E/G_M and F_2/F_1 are not
reproduced by any of the models. Finally, we note that while the inclusion of
recent $\gmn$ data from CLAS modifies the high-$Q^2$ slightly, the tension
between these data and previous measurements at lower $Q^2$ has a more
significant impact, suggesting the need for additional data in this region.

an urban cyber-physical system for gathering up-to-date data about a city, like
traffic conditions or environmental parameters. In this context, it is critical
to design a data collection protocol that enables retrieving the data from the
vehicles in almost real-time in an efficient way for urban scenarios.
  We propose Back off-based Per-hop Forwarding (BPF), a broadcast-based
receiver-oriented protocol that uses the destination location information to
select the forwarding order among the nodes receiving the packet. BFP does not
require nodes to exchange periodic messages with their neighbors communicating
their locations to keep a low management message overhead. It uses geographic
information about the final destination node in the header of each data packet
to route it in a hop-by-hop basis. It takes advantage of redundant forwarding
to increase packet delivery to a destination, what is more critical in an urban
scenario than in a highway, where the road topology does not represent a
challenge for forwarding.
  We evaluate the performance of the BPF protocol using ns-3 and a Manhattan
grid topology and compare it with well-known broadcast suppression techniques.
Our results show that BPF achieves significantly higher packet delivery rates
at a reduced redundancy cost.

been underestimated from a security point-of-view and a systematic analysis of
the Android interplay has not been carried out yet. To this aim, in this paper
we provide a simple model of the Android cross-layer interactions based on the
concept of flow, as a basis for analyzing the Android interplay. In particular,
our model allows us to reason about the security implications associated with
the cross-layer interactions in Android, including a recently discovered
vulnerability that allows a malicious application to make Android devices
totally unresponsive. We used the proposed model to carry out an empirical
assessment of some flows within the Android cross-layered architecture. Our
experiments indicate that little control is exercised by the Android Security
Framework (ASF) over cross-layer interactions in Android. In particular, we
observed that the ASF lacks in discriminating the originator of a flow and
sensitive security issues arise between the Android stack and the Linux kernel,
thereby indicating that the attack surface of the Android platform is wider

increasing the overall entropy and reducing the free energy gain from ordering,
eventually stabilizing the cubic phase. We show that the critical temperature
for cubic phase stability is lowered as Li vacancy concentration (dopant level)
is raised and that an activated hop of Li ions from one crystallographic site

optimised for mid-infrared (MIR) low-resolution spectroscopy. Its flexible
template scaling increases the sensitivity to slope changes and small scale
features in the spectrum, while a new selection algorithm called Maximum
Combined Pseudo-Likelihood (MCPL) provides increased accuracy and a lower
number of outliers compared to the standard maximum-likelihood (ML) approach.
Unlike ML, MCPL searches for local (instead of absolute) maxima of a
'pseudo-likelihood' (PL) function, and combines results obtained for all the
templates in the library to weed out spurious redshift solutions. The
capabilities of MCPL are demonstrated by comparing its results to those of
regular ML and to the optical spectroscopic redshifts of a sample of 491
Spitzer/IRS spectra from sources at 0<z<3.7. MCPL achieves a redshift accuracy
dz/(1+z)<0.005 for 78% of the galaxies in the sample compared to 68% for ML.
The rate of outliers (dz/(1+z)>0.02) is 14% for MCPL and 22% for ML. chi^2
values for ML solutions are found to correlate with the SNR of the spectra, but
not with redshift accuracy. By contrast, the peak value of the normalised
combined PL (gamma) is found to provide a good indication on the reliability of
the MCPL solution for individual sources. The accuracy and reliability of the
redshifts depends strongly on the MIR SED. Sources with significant polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon emission obtain much better results compared to sources
dominated by AGN continuum. Nevertheless, for a given gamma the frequency of
accurate solutions and outliers is largely independent on their SED type. This
reliability indicator for MCPL solutions allows to select subsamples with
highly reliable redshifts. In particular, a gamma>0.15 threshold retains 79% of
the sources with dz/(1+z)<0.005 while reducing the outlier rate to 3.8%
(abridged).

observatories, as well as data taken during a monitoring campaign activated by
us in 2012. The timescale of the Compton-reflection component variability
(originally discovered by ASCA in the mid-'90s) is ~64 days. This upper limit
improves by more than a factor of 15 previous estimates of the
Compton-reflection variability timescale for this source. When the light curve
of the Compton-reflection continuum in the 4-5 keV band is correlated with the
15-150 keV Swift/BAT curve a delay ~1200 days is found. The cross-correlation
results are dependent on the model used to fit the spectra, although the
detection of the Compton-reflection component variability is independent of the
range of models employed to fit the data. Reanalysis of an archival Chandra
image of Markarian 3 indicates that the Compton-reflection and the Fe K-alpha
emitting regions are extended to the North up to ~300 pc. The combination of
these findings suggests that the optically-thick reprocessor in Markarian 3 is
clumpy. There is mounting experimental evidence for the structure of the
optically-thick gas and dust in the nuclear environment of nearby heavily
obscured AGN to be extended and complex. We discuss possible modifications to
the standard unification scenarios encompassing this complexity. Markarian 3,
exhibiting X-ray absorption and reprocessing on widely different spatial

inflaton dissipation and radiation bulk viscous effects. Three representative
approaches of bulk viscous irreversible thermodynamics are analyzed: the Eckart
noncausal theory, the linear and causal theory of Israel-Stewart and a more
recent nonlinear and causal bulk viscous theory. It is found that the causal
theories allow for larger bulk viscosities before encountering an instability
in comparison to the noncausal Eckart theory. It is also shown that the causal
theories tend to suppress the radiation production due to bulk viscous
pressure, because of the presence of relaxation effects implicit in these
theories. Bulk viscosity coefficients derived from quantum field theory are
applied to warm inflation model building and an analysis is made of the effects
to the duration of inflation. The treatment of bulk pressure would also be
relevant to the reheating phase after inflation in cold inflation dynamics and
during the radiation dominated regime, although very little work in both areas
has been done, the methodology developed in this paper could be extended to
apply to these other problems.

energy for both LiFeAs and FeSe. The computed anti-ferromagnetic exchange
interactions between spins on the nearest (next nearest) neighbouring Fe atoms
in LiFeAs and FeSe are approximately 14 (17) meV and 6 (13) meV respectively.
The total energies of the checkerboard and stripe-type anti-ferromagnetic
ordering for LiFeAs and FeSe are compared, yielding that for LiFeAs the
checkerboard is lower whereas for FeSe the stripe-type is lower. However, owing
to the fact that the exchange interaction of the next nearest neighbour is
larger than that of the nearest one, which means that the collinear ordering
might be the ground state. These results are in agreement with previous
theoretical calculations and experiments. Especially the calculations for
LiFeAs indicate a co-existence of conducting d-bands at the Fermi surface and
d-orbital magnetism far below the Fermi surface. The theoretical results
presented here might be useful for the experimentalists working on the

switches called pswitches. The study of stochastic switching circuits has
widespread applications in many fields of computer science, neuroscience, and
biochemistry. In this paper, we discuss several properties of stochastic
switching circuits, including robustness, expressibility, and probability
approximation.
  First, we study the robustness, namely, the effect caused by introducing an
error of size \epsilon to each pswitch in a stochastic circuit. We analyze two
constructions and prove that simple series-parallel circuits are robust to
small error perturbations, while general series-parallel circuits are not.
Specifically, the total error introduced by perturbations of size less than
\epsilon is bounded by a constant multiple of \epsilon in a simple
series-parallel circuit, independent of the size of the circuit.
  Next, we study the expressibility of stochastic switching circuits: Given an
integer q and a pswitch set S=\{\frac{1}{q},\frac{2}{q},...,\frac{q-1}{q}\},
can we synthesize any rational probability with denominator q^n (for arbitrary
n) with a simple series-parallel stochastic switching circuit? We generalize
previous results and prove that when q is a multiple of 2 or 3, the answer is
yes. We also show that when q is a prime number larger than 3, the answer is
no.
  Probability approximation is studied for a general case of an arbitrary
pswitch set S=\{s_1,s_2,...,s_{|S|}\}. In this case, we propose an algorithm
based on local optimization to approximate any desired probability. The
analysis reveals that the approximation error of a switching circuit decreases
exponentially with an increasing circuit size.

and outgoing edges (outputs), tokens enter through the input edges, travel
stochastically in the network, and can exit the network through the output
edges. Each node in the network is a splitter, namely, a token can enter a node
through an incoming edge and exit on one of the output edges according to a
predefined probability distribution. Stochastic flow networks can be easily
implemented by DNA-based chemical reactions, with promising applications in
molecular computing and stochastic computing. In this paper, we address a
fundamental synthesis question: Given a finite set of possible splitters and an
arbitrary rational probability distribution, design a stochastic flow network,
such that every token that enters the input edge will exit the outputs with the
prescribed probability distribution.
  The problem of probability transformation dates back to von Neumann's 1951
work and was followed, among others, by Knuth and Yao in 1976. Most existing
works have been focusing on the ""simulation"" of target distributions. In this
paper, we design optimal-sized stochastic flow networks for ""synthesizing""
target distributions. It shows that when each splitter has two outgoing edges
and is unbiased, an arbitrary rational probability \frac{a}{b} with a\leq b\leq
2^n can be realized by a stochastic flow network of size n that is optimal.
Compared to the other stochastic systems, feedback (cycles in networks)
strongly improves the expressibility of stochastic flow networks.

critical to know the relative contribution of system components to system

individuals can be important; This paper makes two key contributions to this
research area. First, it shows that throughflow, the total energy-matter
entering or exiting a system component, is a global indicator of the relative
contribution of the component to the whole system activity. It is global
because it includes the direct and indirect exchanges among community members.
Further, throughflow is a special case of Hubbell status as defined in social
science. This recognition effectively joins the concepts, enabling ecologists
to use and build on the broader centrality research in network science. Second,
I characterize the distribution of throughflow in 45 empirically-based trophic
ecosystem models. Consistent with expectations, this analysis shows that a
small fraction of the system components are responsible for the majority of the
system activity. In 73% of the ecosystem models, 20% or less of the nodes
generate 80% or more of the total system throughflow. Four or fewer dominant
nodes are required to account for 50% of the total system activity. 121 of the
130 dominant nodes in the 45 ecosystem models could be classified as primary
producers, dead organic matter, or bacteria. Thus, throughflow centrality
indicates the rank power of the ecosystems components and shows the power
concentration in the primary production and decomposition cycle. Although these
results are specific to ecosystems, these techniques build on flow analysis
based on economic input-output analysis. Therefore these results should be
useful for ecosystem ecology, industrial ecology, the study of urban
metabolism, as well as other domains using input-output analysis.

We consider a simple model in which a transversely polarized quark scatters on
a proton or nuclear target. Using the light-cone perturbation theory the hadron
production cross section can be written as a convolution of the light-cone wave
function squared and the interaction with the target. To generate the single
transverse spin asymmetry (STSA) either the wave function squared or the
interaction with the target has to be T-odd. In this work we use the
lowest-order q->qG wave function squared, which is T-even, generating the STSA
from the T-odd interaction with the target mediated by an odderon exchange. We
study the properties of the obtained STSA, some of which are in qualitative
agreement with experiment: STSA increases with increasing projectile x_F and is
a non-monotonic function of the transverse momentum k_T. Our mechanism predicts
that the quark STSA in polarized proton--nucleus collisions should be much
smaller than in polarized proton--proton collisions. We also observe that the
STSA for prompt photons due to our mechanism is zero within the accuracy of the

this finding made by Battaglia et al. (2009) based on RHESSI data analysis. We
have found that nonthermal microwave emission produced by accelerated electrons
with energy of at least several hundred keV, appears as early as the thermal
soft X-ray emission indicative that the electron acceleration takes place at
the very early flare phase. The non-detection of the hard X-rays at that early
stage of the flares is, thus, an artifact of a limited RHESSI sensitivity. In
all considered events, the microwave emission intensity increases at the early
flare phase. We found that either thermal or nonthermal gyrosynchrotron
emission can dominate the low-frequency part of the microwave spectrum below
the spectral peak occurring at 3-10 GHz. In contrast, the high-frequency
optically thin part of the spectrum is always formed by the nonthermal,
accelerated electron component, whose power-law energy spectrum can extend up
to a few MeV at this early flare stage. This means that even though the total
number of accelerated electrons is small at this stage, their nonthermal
spectrum is fully developed. This implies that an acceleration process of
available seed particles is fully operational. While, creation of this seed
population (the process commonly called `injection' of the particles from the
thermal pool into acceleration) has a rather low efficiency at this stage,
although, the plasma heating efficiency is high. This imbalance between the
heating and acceleration (in favor of the heating) is difficult to reconcile
within most of available flare energization models. Being reminiscent of the
tradeoff between the Joule heating and runaway electron acceleration, it puts
additional constraints on the electron injection into the acceleration process.

can be easy to implement using hardware like FPGAs, they are very attractive in
the high-speed applications. In addition, we explore explicit constructions of

scaling of the emission measure indicates a relatively large amount of warm
plasma, suggesting that the hot active region plasma is allowed to cool and so
the heating is impulsive with a long repeat time. This case is called {\it
low-frequency} nanoflare heating and we investigate its feasibility as an
active region heating scenario here. We explore a parameter space of heating
and coronal loop properties with a hydrodynamic model. For each model run, we
calculate the slope $\alpha$ of the emission measure distribution $EM(T)
\propto T^\alpha$. Our conclusions are: (1) low-frequency nanoflare heating is
consistent with about 36% of observed active region cores when uncertainties in
the atomic data are not accounted for; (2) proper consideration of
uncertainties yields a range in which as many as 77% of observed active regions

observation is that in contrast to symmetric errors, asymmetric errors are
content dependent. For example, in Z-channels, the all-1 codeword is prone to
have more errors than the all-0 codeword. This motivates us to develop
nonuniform codes whose codewords can tolerate different numbers of asymmetric
errors depending on their Hamming weights. The idea in a nonuniform codes'
construction is to augment the redundancy in a content-dependent way and
guarantee the worst case reliability while maximizing the code size. In this
paper, we first study nonuniform codes for Z-channels, namely, they only suffer
one type of errors, say 1 to 0. Specifically, we derive their upper bounds,
analyze their asymptotic performances, and introduce two general constructions.
Then we extend the concept and results of nonuniform codes to general binary
asymmetric channels, where the error probability for each bit from 0 to 1 is
smaller than that from 1 to 0.

code. When reading information from a block, it adjusts the reading threshold
such that the resulting word is also balanced or approximately balanced.
Balanced modulation has suboptimal performance for any cell-level distribution
and it can be easily implemented in the current systems of nonvolatile
memories. Furthermore, we studied the construction of balanced error-correcting

decoding algorithms, and it is more efficient than prior construction of
balanced error-correcting codes.

discuss how research-supported approaches developed by physics education
researchers can be adopted by biologists to enhance student problem-solving
skills. First, we compare the problems that biology students are typically
asked to solve with authentic, complex problems. We then describe the
development of research-validated physics curricula emphasizing process skills
in problem solving. We show that solving authentic, complex biology problems
requires many of the same skills that practicing physicists and biologists use
in representing problems, seeking relationships, making predictions, and
verifying or checking solutions. We assert that acquiring these skills can help
biology students become competent problem solvers. Finally, we propose how
biology scholars can apply lessons from physics education in their classrooms
and inspire new studies in biology education research.

to accelerating particles to high energies during solar flares.
  Aims. We present a detailed investigation of the energization processes of
particles in collapsing magnetic traps, using a specific model. We also compare
for the first time the energization processes in a symmetric and an asymmetric
trap model.
  Methods. Particle orbits are calculated using guiding centre theory. We
systematically investigate the dependence of the energization process on
initial position, initial energy and initial pitch angle.
  Results. We find that in our symmetric trap model particles can gain up to
about 50 times their initial energy, but that for most initial conditions the
energy gain is more moderate. Particles with an initial position in the weak
field region of the collapsing trap and with pitch angles around 90 degrees
achieve the highest energy gain, with betatron acceleration of the
perpendicular energy the dominant energization mechanism. For particles with
smaller initial pitch angle, but still outside the loss cone, we find the
possibility of a significant increase in parallel energy. This increase in
parallel energy can be attributed to the curvature term in the parallel
equation of motion and the associated energy gain happens in the center of the
trap where the field line curvature has its maximum. We find qualitatively
similar results for the asymmetric trap model, but with smaller energy gains
and a larger number of particles escaping from the trap.

finding the distance to the Galactic center to be 8 kpc < R_0 < 9 kpc, radial
velocity V_{R,sun} = -10 +/- 1 km/s, and rotational velocity V_{\phi,sun} =
242^{+10}_{-3} km/s, in good agreement with local measurements of the Sun's
radial velocity and with the observed proper motion of Sgr A*. We investigate
various systematic uncertainties and find that these are limited to offsets at
the percent level, ~2 km/s in V_c. Marginalizing over all the systematics that
we consider, we find that V_c(R_0) < 235 km/s at >99% confidence. We find an
offset between the Sun's rotational velocity and the local circular velocity of
26 +/- 3 km/s, which is larger than the locally-measured solar motion of 12
km/s. This larger offset reconciles our value for V_c with recent claims that
V_c >~ 240 km/s. Combining our results with other data, we find that the Milky
Way's dark-halo mass within the virial radius is ~8x10^{11} M_sun.

perturbations into plane waves (Fourier modes). However, for some calculations,
particularly those involving observations performed on a spherical sky, a
decomposition into waves of fixed total angular momentum (TAM) may be more
appropriate. Here we introduce TAM waves, solutions of fixed total angular
momentum to the Helmholtz equation, for three-dimensional scalar, vector, and
tensor fields. The vector TAM waves of given total angular momentum can be
decomposed further into a set of three basis functions of fixed orbital angular
momentum (OAM), a set of fixed helicity, or a basis consisting of a
longitudinal (L) and two transverse (E and B) TAM waves. The symmetric
traceless rank-2 tensor TAM waves can be similarly decomposed into a basis of
fixed OAM or fixed helicity, or a basis that consists of a longitudinal (L),
two vector (VE and VB, of opposite parity), and two tensor (TE and TB, of
opposite parity) waves. We show how all of the vector and tensor TAM waves can
be obtained by applying derivative operators to scalar TAM waves. This operator
approach then allows one to decompose a vector field into three covariant
scalar fields for the L, E, and B components and symmetric-traceless-tensor
fields into five covariant scalar fields for the L, VE, VB, TE, and TB
components. We provide projections of the vector and tensor TAM waves onto
vector and tensor spherical harmonics. We provide calculational detail to
facilitate the assimilation of this formalism into cosmological calculations.
As an example, we calculate the power spectra of the deflection angle for
gravitational lensing by density perturbations and by gravitational waves. We
comment on an alternative approach to CMB fluctuations based on TAM waves. Our
work may have applications elsewhere in field theory and in general relativity.

globular clusters and nearby galaxies is advantageous since the resulting
distances are less impacted by reddening and metallicity. However, K-band
photometry for RR Lyrae variables in M5, Reticulum, M92, omega Cen, and M15
display clustercentric trends. HST ACS data imply that multiple stars in close
proximity to RR Lyrae variables located near the cluster core, where the
stellar density increases markedly, are generally unresolved in ground-based
images. RR Lyrae variables near the cluster cores appear to suffer from
photometric contamination, thereby yielding underestimated cluster distances
and biased ages. The impact is particularly pernicious since the contamination
propagates a systematic uncertainty into the distance scale, and hinders the
quest for precision cosmology. The clustercentric trends are probably
unassociated with variations in chemical composition since an empirical K-band
period-magnitude relation inferred from Araucaria/VLT data for RR Lyrae
variables in the Sculptor dSph exhibits a negligible metallicity dependence:
(0.059+-0.095)[Fe/H], a finding that supports prior observational results. A

bursts (GRBs) are difficult to reconcile with radiatively efficient optically
thin emission models irrespective of the radiation mechanism. An alternative is
to ascribe the radiation around the spectral peak to a thermalization process
occurring well inside the Thomson photosphere. This quasi-thermal spectrum can
evolve into the observed non-thermal shape by additional energy release at
moderate to small Thomson optical depths, which can readily give rise to the
hard spectral tail. The position of the spectral peak is determined by the
temperature and Lorentz factor of the flow in the termalization zone, where the
total number of photons carried by the jet is established. To reach
thermalization, dissipation alone is not sufficient and photon generation
requires an efficient emission/absorption process in addition to scattering. We
perform a systematic study of all relevant photon production mechanisms
searching for possible conditions in which thermalization can take place. We
find that a significant fraction of the available energy should be dissipated
at intermediate radii, $\sim 10^{10}$-- a few$\times 10^{11}$ cm and the flow
there should be relatively slow: the bulk Lorentz factor could not exceed a few
tens for all but the most luminous bursts with the highest $\Epk$-s. The least
restrictive constraint for successful thermalization, $\Gamma\lesssim 20$, is
obtained if synchrotron emission acts as the photon source. This requires,
however, a non-thermal acceleration deep below the Thomson photosphere
transferring a significant fraction of the flow energy to relativistic
electrons with Lorentz factors between 10 and 100. Other processes require bulk
flow Lorentz factors of order of a few for typical bursts. We examine the
implications of these results to different GRB photospheric emission models.

Higgs potential, which would favor light third-generation squarks, and the
stringent LHC bounds on spectra in which the gluino or first and second
generation squarks are light, we focus on scenarios dominated by the pair
production of light stops. We consider the various possible direct and cascade
decays of the stop that involve the trilinear RPV operators. We find that in
many cases, the existing searches exclude stops in the natural mass range and
beyond. However, typically there is little or no sensitivity to cases dominated
by UDD operators or LQD operators involving taus. We propose several ideas for
searches which could address the existing gaps in experimental coverage of
these signals.

accretion is initially their main source of luminosity. The resulting radiative
feedback heats the environments of young protostars, and may thereby suppress
further fragmentation and star formation. There is growing evidence that the
accretion of material onto protostars is episodic rather than continuous; most
of it happens in short bursts that last up to a few hundred years, whereas the
intervals between these outbursts of accretion could be thousands of years. We
have developed a model to include the effects of episodic accretion in
simulations of star formation. Episodic accretion results in episodic radiative
feedback, which heats and temporarily stabilises the disc, suppressing the
growth of gravitational instabilities. However, once an outburst has been
terminated, the luminosity of the protostar is low, and the disc cools rapidly.
Provided that there is enough time between successive outbursts, the disc may
become gravitationally unstable and fragment. The model suggests that episodic
accretion may allow disc fragmentation if (i) the time between successive
outbursts is longer than the dynamical timescale for the growth of
gravitational instabilities (a few kyr), and (ii) the quiescent accretion rate
onto the protostar is sufficiently low (at most a few times 1e-7 Msun/yr). We
also find that after a few protostars form in the disc, their own episodic
accretion events shorten the intervals between successive outbursts, and sup-
press further fragmentation, thus limiting the number of objects forming in the
disc. We conclude that episodic accretion moderates the effect of radiative
feedback from young protostars on their environments, and, under certain
conditions, allows the formation of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and
planetary-mass objects by fragmentation of protostellar discs.

evolution of the cluster mass function during violent relaxation, that is,
while clusters dynamically respond to the expulsion of their residual
star-forming gas. Mass-dependent evolutionary rates arise when the mean volume
density of cluster-forming regions is mass-dependent. In that case, even if the
initial conditions are such that the cluster mass function at the end of
violent relaxation has the same shape as the embedded-cluster mass function
(i.e. infant weight-loss is mass-independent), the shape of the cluster mass
function does change transiently {\it during} violent relaxation. In contrast,
for cluster-forming regions of constant mean volume density, the cluster mass
function shape is preserved all through violent relaxation since all clusters
then evolve at the same mass-independent rate.
  On the scale of individual clusters, we model the evolution of the ratio
between the dynamical mass and luminous mass of a cluster after gas expulsion.
Specifically, we map the radial dependence of the time-scale for a star cluster
to return to equilibrium. We stress that fields-of-view a few pc in size only,
typical of compact clusters with rapid evolutionary rates, are likely to reveal
cluster regions which have returned to equilibrium even if the cluster
experienced a major gas expulsion episode a few Myr earlier. We provide models
with the aperture and time expressed in units of the initial half-mass radius
and initial crossing-time, respectively, so that our results can be applied to
clusters with initial densities, sizes, and apertures different from ours.

adoption of locally-calibrated CO-H2 conversion factors (Xco). Evidence from
both observations and numerical models suggest that Xco varies smoothly with
the physical properties of galaxies, and that Xco can be parameterised simply
as a function of both gas phase metallicity and observed CO surface brightness.
When applying this functional form, we find fgas ~10-40 % in galaxies with
M*=10^10-10^12 Msun at high-z. Moreover, the scatter in the observed fgas-M*

physically because the interstellar media of high-z galaxies have higher
velocity dispersions and gas temperatures than their local counterparts, which
results in an Xco that is lower than the z=0 value for both quiescent discs and
starbursts. We further compare these gas fractions to those predicted by
cosmological galaxy formation models. We show that while the canonically
inferred gas fractions from observations are a factor of 2-3 larger at a given

advantageous when the field equations are not separable. As an illustration of
the method we investigate massive vector (Proca) perturbations in the Kerr

formalism. Working in a perturbative scheme, we discuss two important effects
induced by rotation: a Zeeman-like shift of nonaxisymmetric quasinormal modes
and bound states with different azimuthal number m, and the coupling between
axial and polar modes with different multipolar index l. We explicitly compute
the perturbation equations up to second order in rotation, but in principle the
method can be extended to any order. Working at first order in rotation we show
that polar and axial Proca modes can be computed by solving two decoupled sets
of equations, and we derive a single master equation describing axial
perturbations of spin s=0 and s=+-1. By extending the calculation to second
order we can study the superradiant regime of Proca perturbations in a
self-consistent way. For the first time we show that Proca fields around Kerr
black holes exhibit a superradiant instability, which is significantly stronger
than for massive scalar fields. Because of this instability, astrophysical
observations of spinning black holes provide the tightest upper limit on the
mass of the photon: mv<4x10^-20 eV under our most conservative assumptions.
Spin measurements for the largest black holes could reduce this bound to
mv<10^-22 eV or lower.

fundamentally different types depending on whether the luminosity traces galaxy
stellar mass or its current star formation rate (SFR). Mass function types
reflect the older stars and therefore the stellar mass distribution, while SFR
function types arise from the young stars and hence the distribution of SFRs.
Optical and near-infrared LFs are of the mass function type, and are well fit
by a Schechter function (power law with an exponential cutoff at the bright
end). In contrast, LFs of the SFR function type are of a different form, one
that cannot be adequately described by a Schechter function. We demonstrate
this difference by generating SFR distributions for mock samples of galaxies
drawn from a Schechter stellar mass distribution along with established
empirical relations between the SFR and stellar mass. Compared with the
Schechter function, SFR distributions have a shallower decline at the bright
end, which can be traced to the large intrinsic scatter of SFRs at any given
stellar mass. A superior description of SFR distributions is given by the
""Saunders"" function, which combines a power law with a Gaussian at the high
end. We show that the Schechter-like appearance of UV and H alpha LFs, although
they are LFs of SFR function type, results when luminosities are not corrected
for dust, or when average statistical corrections are used because individual
attenuation measurements are not available. We thus infer that the
non-Schechter form of the far-IR LFs is a true reflection of the underlying SFR
distribution, rather than the purported artifact of AGN contamination.

the evolution of S0's, on the basis that mergers cannot preserve the coupling
between the bulge and disk scale-lengths observed in these galaxies and the
lack of correlation of their ratio with the S0 Hubble type. We investigate
whether the remnants resulting from collision-less N-body simulations of
intermediate and minor mergers onto S0 galaxies evolve fulfilling global
structural relations observed between the bulges and disks of these galaxies.
Different initial bulge-to-disk ratios of the primary S0 have been considered,
as well as different satellite densities, mass ratios, and orbits of the
encounter. We have analysed the final morphology of the remnants in images
simulating the typical observing conditions of S0 surveys. We derive bulge+disk
decompositions of the final remnants to compare their global bulge-to-disk
structure with observations. We show that all remnants present undisturbed S0
morphologies according to the prescriptions of specialized surveys. The dry
intermediate and minor mergers induce noticeable bulge growth (S0c --> S0b and
S0b --> S0a), but affect negligibly to the bulge and disk scale-lengths.
Therefore, if a coupling between these two components exists prior to the
merger, the encounter does not break this coupling. This fact provides a simple
explanation for the lack of correlation between the ratio of bulge and disk
scale-lengths and the S0 Hubble type reported by observations. These models
prove that dry intermediate and minor mergers can induce global structural
evolution within the sequence of S0 Hubble types compatible with observations,
meaning that these processes should not be discarded from the evolutionary
scenarios of S0's just on the basis of the strong coupling observed between the
bulge and disk scale-lengths in these galaxies (abridged).

accretion disks. Accretion of matter onto an NS may increase its mass above the
maximum value allowed by its equation of state, inducing its collapse to a
black hole (BH). Here we study this process for the first time, in
three-dimensions, and in full general relativity. By considering three initial
NS configurations, each with and without a surrounding disk (of mass ~7%
M_{NS}), we investigate the effect of the accretion disk on the dynamics of the
collapse and its imprint on both the gravitational wave (GW) and
electromagnetic (EM) signals that can be emitted by these sources. We show in
particular that, even if the GW signal is similar for the accretion induced
collapse (AIC) and the collapse of an NS in vacuum (and detectable only for
Galactic sources), the EM counterpart could allow us to discriminate between
these two types of events. In fact, our simulations show that, while the
collapse of an NS in vacuum leaves no appreciable baryonic matter outside the
event horizon, an AIC is followed by a phase of rapid accretion of the
surviving disk onto the newly formed BH. The post-collapse accretion rates, on
the order of ~10^{-2} M_{sun} s^{-1}, make these events tantalizing candidates
as engines of short gamma-ray bursts.

uses a source normalized approach to correct for differences in citation

does not require a field classification system in which the boundaries of
fields are explicitly defined. In this paper, a number of modifications that
will be made to the SNIP indicator are explained, and the advantages of the
resulting revised SNIP indicator are pointed out. It is argued that the
original SNIP indicator has some counterintuitive properties, and it is shown
mathematically that the revised SNIP indicator does not have these properties.
Empirically, the differences between the original SNIP indicator and the

differences can be observed. Relations with other source normalized indicators

interferometric HI and 20 cm radio continuum observations of CIG 85, an
isolated asymmetric galaxy from the AMIGA (Analysis of the Interstellar Medium
of Isolated GAlaxies) sample. Despite being an isolated galaxy, CIG 85 showed
an appreciable optical and HI spectral asymmetry and therefore was an excellent
candidate for resolved HI studies to understand the reasons giving rise to
asymmetries in isolated galaxies. The galaxy was imaged in HI and 20 cm radio
continuum using the GMRT. For a detailed discussion of the results we also made
use of multi-wavelength data from archival SDSS, GALEX and Halpha imaging. We
find the HI in CIG 85 to have a clumpy, asymmetric distribution which in the NW
part is correlated with optical tail like features, but the HI velocity field
displays a relatively regular rotation pattern. Evaluating all the
observational evidence, we come to a conclusion that CIG 85 is most likely a
case of a disturbed spiral galaxy which now appears to have the morphology of
an irregular galaxy. Although it is currently isolated from major companions,
the observational evidence is consistent with HI asymmetries, a highly
disturbed optical disk and recent increase in star formation having been caused
by a minor merger, remnants of which are now projected in front of the optical
disk. If this is correct, the companion will be fully accreted by CIG 85 in the
near future.

value, the LDOS can distinguish an anisotropic from a conventional isotropic
s-wave gap. We show within our self-consistent calculation that in addition,
the local gap profile differs between a conventional and an unconventional

Ginzburg-Landau theory. In-field scanning tunneling spectroscopy near vortices
can therefore be used as a real-space probe of the gap structure.

When observed in X-ray or extreme ultraviolet emission, these million K hot
coronal loops show a more or less constant cross section. In this study we show
how the interplay of heating, radiative cooling, and heat conduction in an
expanding magnetic structure can explain the observed constant cross section.
We employ a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (3D MHD) model of the
corona. The heating of the coronal plasma is the result of braiding of the
magnetic field lines through footpoint motions and subsequent dissipation of
the induced currents. From the model we synthesize the coronal emission, which
is directly comparable to observations from, e.g., the Atmospheric Imaging
Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (AIA/SDO). We find that the
synthesized observation of a coronal loop seen in the 3D data cube does match
actually observed loops in count rate and that the cross section is roughly
constant, as observed. The magnetic field in the loop is expanding and the
plasma density is concentrated in this expanding loop; however, the temperature
is not constant perpendicular to the plasma loop. The higher temperature in the
upper outer parts of the loop is so high that this part of the loop is outside
the contribution function of the respective emission line(s). In effect, the
upper part of the plasma loop is not bright and thus the loop actually seen in
coronal emission appears to have a constant width. From this we can conclude
that the underlying field-line-braiding heating mechanism provides the proper
spatial and temporal distribution of the energy input into the corona --- at
least on the observable scales.

communication or when signal transmission between components is deferred. We
distinguish strategies with different degrees of lookahead, among them being
the continuous and the bounded lookahead strategies. In the first case the
lookahead is of finite possibly unbounded size, whereas in the second case it
is of bounded size. We show that for regular infinite games the solvability by
continuous strategies is decidable, and that a continuous strategy can always
be reduced to one of bounded lookahead. Moreover, this lookahead is at most
doubly exponential in the size of a given parity automaton recognizing the
winning condition. We also show that the result fails for non-regular
gamesxwhere the winning condition is given by a context-free omega-language.

particular attention to the role of structural defects present in solid. The
discussion centers around the possible role of two level systems and structural
glassy components for inducing the observed anomalies. We propose that the
origin of glassy behavior is due to the dynamics of defects like dislocations
formed in He-4. Within the developed framework of glassy components in a solid,
we give a summary of the results and predictions for the effects that cover the
mechanical, thermodynamic, viscoelastic, and electro-elastic contributions of
the glassy response of solid He-4. Our proposed glass model for solid He-4 has
several implications: (1) The anomalous properties of He-4 can be accounted for
by allowing defects to freeze out at lowest temperatures. The dynamics of solid
He-4 is governed by glasslike (glassy) relaxation processes and the
distribution of relaxation times varies significantly between different
torsional oscillator, shear modulus, and dielectric function experiments. (2)
Any defect freeze-out will be accompanied by thermodynamic signatures
consistent with entropy contributions from defects. It follows that such
entropy contribution is much smaller than the required superfluid fraction, yet
it is sufficient to account for excess entropy at lowest temperatures. (3) We
predict a Cole-Cole type relation between the real and imaginary part of the
response functions for rotational and planar shear that is occurring due to the
dynamics of defects. Similar results apply for other response functions. (4)
Using the framework of glassy dynamics, we predict low-frequency yet to be
measured electro-elastic features in defect rich He-4 crystals. These
predictions allow one to directly test the ideas and very presence of glassy
contributions in He-4.

low-metallicity galaxy Haro 11, dissecting the photoionised and
photodissociated gas components. We present observations of the mid- and far-IR
fine-structure cooling lines obtained with the Spitzer/IRS and Herschel/PACS
spectrometers. We use the spectral synthesis code Cloudy to methodically model
the ionised and neutral gas from which these lines originate. We find that the
mid- and far-IR lines account for ~1% of the total IR luminosity L_TIR. Haro 11
is undergoing a phase of intense star formation, as traced by the brightest
line [OIII] 88um, with L_[OIII]/L_TIR ~0.3%, and high ratios of [NeIII]/[NeII]
and [SIV]/[SIII]. Due to their different origins, the observed lines require a
multi-phase modeling comprising: a compact HII region, dense fragmented
photodissociation regions (PDRs), a diffuse extended low-ionisation/neutral gas
which has a volume filling factor of at least 90%, and porous warm dust in
proximity to the stellar source. For a more realistic picture of the ISM of
Haro 11 we would need to model the clumpy source and gas structures. We combine
these 4 model components to explain the emission of 17 spectral lines,
investigate the global energy balance of the galaxy through its spectral energy
distribution, and establish a phase mass inventory. While the ionic emission
lines of Haro 11 essentially originate from the dense HII region component, a
diffuse low-ionisation gas is needed to explain the [NeII], [NII], and [CII]
line intensities. The [OIII] 88um line intensity is not fully reproduced by our
model, hinting towards the possible presence of yet another low-density
high-ionisation medium. The [OI] emission is consistent with a dense PDR of low
covering factor, and we find no evidence for an X-ray dominated component. The
PDR component accounts for only 10% of the [CII] emission.

consider shock heating within the photoionized nebula.
  Varying the various input parameters in the pure photoionization case does

with both radio and X-ray observations, but an observation at an intermediate
frequency in the infrared can be critical to distinguish between competing
models for particle acceleration and radiation processes in these objects.
Between the archival and warm mission data, we report detections of 18
hotspots; the archival data generally include detections at all four IRAC
bands, the Warm Mission data only at 3.6 microns.
  Using a theoretical formalism adopted from Godfrey et al. (2009), we fit both
archival and warm mission spectral energy distributions [SEDs] - including
radio, X-ray, and optical data from Hardcastle as well as the Spitzer data -
with a synchrotron self-Compton [SSC] model, in which the X-rays are produced
by Compton scattering of the radio frequency photons by the energetic electrons
which radiate them. With one exception, a SSC model requires that the magnetic
field be less or much less than the equipartition value which minimizes total
energy and has comparable amounts of energy in the magnetic field and in the
energetic particles. This conclusion agrees with those of comparable recent
studies of hotspots, and with the analysis presented by Hardcastle et al.
(2004). We also show that the infrared data rule out the simplest synchrotron
only models for the SEDs. We briefly discuss the implications of these results

fragments inception and their final separation at scission deformation. The
evolution of the nucleus energy with deformation is determined by the
macroscopic properties of the nucleus, and is also strongly influenced by the
single-particle structure of the nucleus. The fission fragment distribution is
a direct consequence of the deformation path the nucleus has encountered, and
therefore is the most genuine experimental observation of the potential energy
landscape of the deforming nucleus. Very asymmetric fusion-fission reactions at
energy close to the Coulomb barrier, produce well-defined conditions of the
compound nucleus formation, where processes such as quasi-fission,
pre-equilibrium emission and incomplete fusion are negligible. In the same
time, the excitation energy is sufficient to reduce significantly structural
effects, and mostly the macroscopic part of the potential is responsible for
the formation of the fission fragments. We use inverse kinematics combined with
spectrometers to select and identify the fission fragments produced in
$^{238}$U+$^{12}$C at a bombarding energy close to and well-above the Coulomb
barrier. For the first time, the isotopic yields are measured over the complete
atomic-number distribution, between Z=30 and Z=63. The experimental set-up also
allows to identify transfer-induced reactions, which lead to low-energy fission
where the nuclear shell structure shows a strong influence on the
fission-fragment distributions. The resulting set of data gives the possibility
to observe the fission fragment properties over a wide range of excitation
energy, and they reveal the vanishing of the shell effects in the potential
energy of the fissioning nucleus, as well as the influence of fission dynamics.

constant at weak coupling using classical statistical lattice simulations for
SU(2) gauge theory and show how these non-linearities can be analytically
understood within the framework of two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective

in accordance with analytic expectations. Concerning the isotropization of bulk

identified previously as a SN impostor. The light curve exhibits an abrupt
transition from a well-defined ~120 day plateau to a steep bolometric decline.
Leading up to peak brightness, a hot emission-line spectrum exhibits signs of
interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), in the form of relatively narrow
P-Cygni features of H I and He I superimposed on broad Lorentzian wings. For
the remainder of the plateau phase the spectrum exhibits strengthening P-Cygni
profiles of Fe II, Ca II, and H-alpha. By day 147, after the plateau has ended,
the SN entered the nebular phase, heralded by the appearance of forbidden
transitions of [O I], [O II], and [Ca II] over a weak continuum. At this stage,
the light curve exhibits a low luminosity that is comparable to that
sub-luminous Type II-P supernovae, and a relatively fast visual-wavelength
decline that is significantly steeper than the Co-56 decay rate. However, the
total bolometric decline, including the IR luminosity, is consistent with Co-56
decay, and implies a low Ni-56 mass of ~0.01 M(Sun). We therefore characterize
SN 2011ht as a bona-fide core-collapse SN very similar to the peculiar SNe IIn
1994W and 2009kn. These three SNe define a subclass, which are Type IIn based
on their spectrum, but that also exhibit well-defined plateaus and produce low
Ni-56 yields. We therefore suggest Type IIn-P as a name for this subclass.
Possible progenitors of SNe IIn-P, consistent with the available data, include
8-10 M(Sun) stars, which undergo core collapse as a result of electron capture
after a brief phase of enhanced mass loss, or more massive M>25 M(Sun)
progenitors, which experience substantial fallback of the metal-rich
radioactive ejecta. In either case, the energy radiated by these three SNe
during their plateau must be dominated by CSM interaction (abridged).

likely hosting the first (PopIII) stars with cosmological simulations including
detailed gas physics. In the redshift range considered ($11 < z < 16$) the
average sphericity is $<s> = 0.3 \pm 0.1$, and for more than 90% of halos the
triaxiality parameter is $T \lesssim 0.4$, showing a clear preference for
oblateness over prolateness. Larger halos in the simulation tend to be both
more spherical and prolate: we find $s \propto M_h^{\alpha_s}$ and $T \propto
M_h^{\alpha_T}$, with $\alpha_s \approx 0.128$ and $\alpha_T= 0.276$ at z = 11.
The spin distributions of dark matter and gas are considerably different at
$z=16$, with the baryons rotating slower than the dark matter. At lower
redshift, instead, the spin distributions of dark matter and gas track each
other almost perfectly, as a consequence of a longer time interval available
for momentum redistribution between the two components. The spin of both the
gas and dark matter follows a lognormal distribution, with a mean value at z=16
of $<\lambda> =0.0184$, virtually independent of halo mass. This is in good
agreement with previous studies. Using the results of two feedback models (MT1
and MT2) by McKee & Tan (2008) and mapping our halo spin distribution into a
PopIII IMF, we find that at high-$z$ the IMF closely tracks the spin lognormal
distribution. Depending on the feedback model, though, the distribution can be
centered at $\approx 65 M_\odot$ (MT1) or $\approx 140 M_\odot$ (MT2). At later
times, model MT1 evolves into a bimodal distribution with a second prominent
peak located at $35-40 M_\odot$ as a result of the non-linear relation between
rotation and halo mass. We conclude that the dark matter halo properties might
be a key factor shaping the IMF of the first stars.

(PED) is to drop the middle part of edges and rely on the remaining edge parts
called stubs. We focus on a symmetric model (SPED) that requires the two stubs
of an edge to be of equal length. In this way, the stub at the other endpoint
of an edge assures the viewer of the edge's existence. We also consider an
additional homogeneity constraint that forces the stub lengths to be a given
fraction $\delta$ of the edge lengths ($\delta$-SHPED). Given length and
direction of a stub, this model helps to infer the position of the opposite
stub.
  We show that, for a fixed stub--edge length ratio $\delta$, not all graphs
have a $\delta$-SHPED. Specifically, we show that $K_{241}$ does not have a
1/4-SHPED, while bandwidth-$k$ graphs always have a $\Theta(1/\sqrt{k})$-SHPED.
We also give bounds for complete bipartite graphs. Further, we consider the
problem \textsc{MaxSPED} where the task is to compute the SPED of maximum total
stub length that a given straight-line drawing contains. We present an
efficient solution for 2-planar drawings and a 2-approximation algorithm for

The
mechanism underlying metabolic network modularity is of great interest not only
to researchers of basic science but also to those in fields of engineering.
Previous studies have suggested a theoretical model, which proposes that a
change in the evolutionary goal (system-specific purpose) increases network
modularity, and this hypothesis was supported by statistical data analysis.
Nevertheless, further investigation has uncovered additional possibilities that
might explain the origin of network modularity. In this work, we propose an
evolving network model without tuning parameters to describe metabolic
networks. We demonstrate, quantitatively, that metabolic network modularity can
arise from simple growth processes, independent of the change in the
evolutionary goal. Our model is applicable to a wide range of organisms, and
appears to suggest that metabolic network modularity can be more simply
determined than previously thought. Nonetheless, our proposition does not serve
to contradict the previous model; it strives to provide an insight from a
different angle in the ongoing efforts to understand metabolic evolution, with
the hope of eventually achieving the synthetic engineering of metabolic
networks.

eliminates the effects of errors and retains only connections between the data
points from the same subspace (i.e., intra-subspace data points). Recent works
achieve good performance by modeling errors into their objective functions to
remove the errors from the inputs. However, these approaches face the
limitations that the structure of errors should be known prior and a complex
convex problem must be solved. In this paper, we present a novel method to
eliminate the effects of the errors from the projection space (representation)
rather than from the input space. We first prove that $\ell_1$-, $\ell_2$-,
$\ell_{\infty}$-, and nuclear-norm based linear projection spaces share the
property of Intra-subspace Projection Dominance (IPD), i.e., the coefficients
over intra-subspace data points are larger than those over inter-subspace data
points. Based on this property, we introduce a method to construct a sparse
similarity graph, called L2-Graph. The subspace clustering and subspace
learning algorithms are developed upon L2-Graph. Experiments show that L2-Graph
algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods for feature extraction,
image clustering, and motion segmentation in terms of accuracy, robustness, and
time efficiency.

(P2P) communication which overlays a cellular network and shares its resources.
Applying P2P communication to cellular network has two key issues: 1.
Conventional ad hoc P2P connections may be unstable since stringent resource
and interference coordination is usually difficult to achieve for ad hoc P2P
communications; 2. The large overhead required by P2P communication may offset
its gain. We solve these two issues by using a special discovery signal to aid
cellular network-supervised resource sharing and interference management
between cellular and P2P connections. The discovery signal, which facilitates
efficient neighbor discovery in a cellular system, consists of un-modulated
tones transmitted on a sequence of OFDM symbols. This discovery signal not only
possesses the properties of high power efficiency, high interference tolerance,
and freedom from near-far effects, but also has minimal overhead. A practical
discovery-signal-based P2P in an OFDMA cellular system is also proposed.
Numerical results are presented which show the potential of improving local
service and edge device performance in a cellular network.

status of the Return Times Theorem and its many extensions and variations. Let
$(X, \mathcal{F}, \mu)$ be a finite measure space and let $T:X \rightarrow X$
be a measure preserving transformation. Perhaps the oldest result in ergodic
theory is that of Poincar\'e's Recurrence Principle which states: For any set
$A \in \mathcal{F}$, the set of points $x$ of $A$ such that $T^nx$ is not in
the set $A$ for all $n > 0$ has zero measure. This says that almost every point
of $A$ returns to $A$. In fact, almost every point of $A$ returns to $A$
infinitely often.
  The return time for a given element $x \in A$, $r_A(x) = \inf\{k \geq 1: T^kx
\in A\}$, is the first time that the element $x$ returns to the set $A$. By
Poincar\'e's Recurrence Principle there is set of full measure in $A$ such that
all elements of this set have a finite return time. Our study of the Return
Times Theorem asks how we can further generalize this notion.
  The paper begins by looking at early work with the concept of weighted
averages. The second portion of the paper focuses on the historical development
of the proofs of the Return Times Theorem. Three areas of extension of the
Return Times Theorem are then considered: a multiterm version, characteristic
factors and breaking the H\""olderian duality. The paper concludes with
discussion of some more recent work and open questions to consider.

field. In this background spacetime we have studied the cosmological dynamics
of the domain wall. In addition to the Born-Infield gauge field if we consider
additional pure gauge field, a non-singular bounce happens at the early stage
with a smooth transition between contracting and expanding phase.

homogeneous polar cell - an elementary pattern used in hydrodynamical
simulations of gravitating discs. This formula, which is a closed-form, works
for any opening angle and radial extension of the cell. It is valid at any
point in space, i.e. in the plane of the distribution (inside and outside) as
well as off-plane, thereby generalizing the results reported by Durand (1953)
for the circular disc. The three components of the gravitational acceleration
are given. The mathematical demonstration proceeds from the ""incomplete version
of Durand's formula"" for the potential (based on complete elliptic integrals).
We determine first the potential due to the circular sector (i.e. a pie-slice
sheet), and then deduce that of the polar cell (from convenient radial scaling
and subtraction). As a by-product, we generate an integral theorem stating that
""the angular average of the potential of any circular sector along its tangent
circle is 2/PI times the value at the corner"". A few examples are presented.
For numerical resolutions and cell shapes commonly used in disc simulations, we
quantify the importance of curvature effects by performing a direct comparison
between the potential of the polar cell and that of the Cartesian (i.e.
rectangular) cell having the same mass. Edge values are found to deviate
roughly like 2E-3 x N/256 in relative (N is the number of grid points in the
radial direction), while the agreement is typically four orders of magnitude
better for values at the cell's center. We also produce a reliable
approximation for the potential, valid in the cell's plane, inside and close to
the cell. Its remarkable accuracy, about 5E-4 x N/256 in relative, is
sufficient to estimate the cell's self-acceleration.

J^{pi}, and find convergence around J^{pi}_{max} = 6^{-}. We include further

geometrical universality classes corresponding to the plane, the sphere and the

anti-sphere with truncations of unitary matrices. This paper focusses on an
ensemble corresponding to the sphere: matrices of the form $\bY= \bA^{-1} \bB$,
where $\bA$ and $\bB$ are independent $N\times N$ matrices with iid standard
Gaussian real quaternion entries. By applying techniques similar to those used
for the analogous complex and real spherical ensembles, the eigenvalue jpdf and
correlation functions are calculated. This completes the exploration of
spherical matrices using the traditional Dyson indices $\beta=1,2,4$.
  We find that the eigenvalue density (after stereographic projection onto the
sphere) has a depletion of eigenvalues along a ring corresponding to the real
axis, with reflective symmetry about this ring. However, in the limit of large
matrix dimension, this eigenvalue density approaches that of the corresponding
complex ensemble, a density which is uniform on the sphere. This result is in
keeping with the spherical law (analogous to the circular law for iid
matrices), which states that for matrices having the spherical structure $\bY=
\bA^{-1} \bB$, where $\bA$ and $\bB$ are independent, iid matrices the
(stereographically projected) eigenvalue density tends to uniformity on the

larger than 0.5 A. To compare an individual GRB with the sample, we develop EW

quantify the strength of the absorption features as compared to the sample by a
single number. Using the distributions of EWs of single-species features, we
derive the distribution of column densities by a curve of growth (CoG) fit. We
find correlations between the LSP and the extinction of the GRB, the UV
brightness of the host galaxies and the neutral hydrogen column density.
However, we see no significant evolution of the LSP with the redshift. There is
a weak correlation between the ionisation of the absorbers and the energy of
the GRB, indicating that, either the GRB event is responsible for part of the
ionisation, or that galaxies with high-ionisation media produce more energetic
GRBs. Spectral features in GRB spectra are, on average, 2.5 times stronger than
those seen in QSO intervening damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems and slightly
more ionised. In particular we find larger excess in the EW of CIV1549 relative
to QSO DLAs, which could be related to an excess of Wolf-Rayet stars in the
environments of GRBs. From the CoG fitting we obtain an average number of
components in the absorption features of GRBs of 6.00(-1.25,+1.00). The most
extreme ionisation ratios in our sample are found for GRBs with low neutral
hydrogen column density, which could be related to ionisation by the GRB

effective temperatures, photospheric colors, luminosities, masses, and ages for

masses between 0.4 and 4 M$_\odot$ and ages between 1-2 Myrs and 6-7 Myrs. We
find that the SE region is the most recent site of star formation, while the
older YSOs are loosely clustered in the N and W regions. The presence of two
distint generations of YSOs with different spatial distribution allows us to
conclude that in this region there is an age spread of ~6-7 Myrs. This is
consistent with the scenario of sequential star formation suggested in

quantify the dynamics of elongated particles in a confined fluid. In this
regime hydrodynamic interactions between particles arise from a superposition
of potential dipolar singularities. We exploit this feature to derive the
equations of motion for the particle positions and orientations. After showing
that all five planar Bravais lattices are stationary solutions of the equations
of motion, we consider separately the case where the particles are passively
driven by an external force, and the situation where they are self-propelling.
We first demonstrate that phonon modes propagate in driven crystals, which are
always marginally stable. The spatial structure of the eigenmodes depend solely
on the symmetries of the lattices, and on the orientation of the driving force.
For active crystals, the stability of the particle positions and orientations
depends not only on the symmetry of the crystals but also on the perturbation
wavelengths and on the crystal density. Unlike unconfined fluids, the stability
of active crystals is independent of the nature of the propulsion mechanism at
the single particle level. The square and rectangular lattices are found to be
linearly unstable at short wavelengths provided the volume fraction of the
crystals is high enough. Differently, hexagonal, oblique, and face-centered
crystals are always unstable. Our work provides a theoretical basis for future
experimental work on flowing microfluidic crystals.

Realization of single-photon Dicke states relies on the cooperative nature of
the interaction between a field reservoir and an array of two-level-emitters.
The resulting dynamics of the delocalized state can display Rabi-like
oscillations when the number of two-level emitters exceeds several hundred. In
this case the large array of emitters is essentially behaving like a
mirror-less cavity. We outline how this might be realized using a
multiple-quantum-well structure and discuss how the quantum nature of these
oscillations could be tested with the Leggett-Garg inequality and its

formulated as a system of nonlinear equations with multiple solutions that is
generally difficult to solve numerically. All the solutions of this nonlinear
system are reduced to the computation of the zeros of a single nonlinear

function, permits to solve the single nonlinear equation with a few iterations
of the Newton--Raphson method.
  The computation of the clothoid curve requires the computation of Fresnel and
Fresnel related integrals. Such integrals need asymptotic expansions near
critical values to avoid loss of precision. This is necessary when, for
example, the solution of interpolation problem is close to a straight line or
an arc of circle. Moreover, some special recurrences are deduced for the
efficient computation of asymptotic expansion.

recommender systems have witnessed rapid development in the last decade. As
benefited from the better interpretability, neighborhood-based collaborative
filtering techniques, such as item-based collaborative filtering adopted by
Amazon, have gained a great success in many practical recommender systems.
However, the neighborhood-based collaborative filtering method suffers from the
rating bound problem, i.e., the rating on a target item that this method
estimates is bounded by the observed ratings of its all neighboring items.
Therefore, it cannot accurately estimate the unobserved rating on a target
item, if its ground truth rating is actually higher (lower) than the highest
(lowest) rating over all items in its neighborhood. In this paper, we address
this problem by formalizing rating estimation as a task of recovering a scalar
rating function. With a linearity assumption, we infer all the ratings by
optimizing the low-order norm, e.g., the $l_1/2$-norm, of the second derivative
of the target scalar function, while remaining its observed ratings unchanged.
Experimental results on three real datasets, namely Douban, Goodreads and
MovieLens, demonstrate that the proposed approach can well overcome the rating
bound problem. Particularly, it can significantly improve the accuracy of
rating estimation by 37% than the conventional neighborhood-based methods.

N=2 to N=1 truncated supergravities without vector multiplets, and compare with
the situations arising in N=2 theories with only hypermultiplets and N=1
theories with only chiral multiplets. In N=2 theories based on a quaternionic
manifold and a graviphoton gauging, de Sitter vacua are necessarily unstable,
as a result of the peculiar properties of the geometry. In N=1 theories based
on a Kahler manifold and a superpotential, de Sitter vacua can instead be
metastable provided the geometry satisfies some constraint and the
superpotential can be freely adjusted. In N=2 to N=1 truncations, the crucial
requirement is then that the tachyon of the mother theory be projected out from
the daughter theory, so that the original unstable vacuum is projected to a
metastable vacuum. We study the circumstances under which this may happen and
derive general constraints for metastability on the geometry and the gauging.
We then study in full detail the simplest case of quaternionic manifolds of
dimension four with at least one isometry, for which there exists a general
parametrization, and study two types of truncations defining Kahler
submanifolds of dimension two. As an application, we finally discuss the case
of the universal hypermultiplet of N=2 superstrings and its truncations to the
dilaton chiral multiplet of N=1 superstrings. We argue that de Sitter vacua in
such theories are necessarily unstable in weakly coupled situations, while they
can in principle be metastable in strongly coupled regimes.

a flat set of relevant features and provide no further information on what kind
of structures, e.g. feature groupings, might underly the set of relevant
features. In this paper we propose a new learning paradigm in which our goal is
to uncover the structures that underly the set of relevant features for a given
learning problem. We uncover two types of features sets, non-replaceable
features that contain important information about the target variable and
cannot be replaced by other features, and functionally similar features sets
that can be used interchangeably in learned models, given the presence of the
non-replaceable features, with no change in the predictive performance. To do
so we propose a new learning algorithm that learns a number of disjoint models
using a model disjointness regularization constraint together with a constraint
on the predictive agreement of the disjoint models. We explore the behavior of
our approach on a number of high-dimensional datasets, and show that, as
expected by their construction, these satisfy a number of properties. Namely,
model disjointness, a high predictive agreement, and a similar predictive
performance to models learned on the full set of relevant features. The ability
to structure the set of relevant features in such a manner can become a

flow first accelerates, then arrests. Recent experiments under such loading
have found this to be accompanied by a striking dip in the segmental relaxation
time. This can be explained by a minimal nonfactorable model combining
flow-induced melting of a glass with the buildup of stress carried by strained
polymers. Within this model, liquefaction of segmental motion permits strong
flow that creates polymer-borne stress, slowing the deformation enough for the
segmental (or solvent) modes to then re-vitrify. Here we present new results
for the corresponding behavior under step-stress shear loading, to which very
similar physics applies. To explain the unloading behavior in the extensional
case requires introduction of a crinkle factor describing a rapid loss of
segmental ordering. We discuss in more detail here the physics of this, which
we argue involves non-entropic contributions to the polymer stress, and which
might lead to some important differences between shear and elongation. We also
discuss some fundamental and possibly testable issues concerning the physical
meaning of entropic elasticity in vitrified polymers. Finally we present new
results for the startup of steady shear flow, addressing the possible role of
transient shear banding.

Rydberg atoms are very well-suited to achieve this goal, as the van der Waals
forces between them are many orders of magnitude larger than for ground state
atoms. Consequently, the mere laser excitation of ultracold gases can cause
strongly correlated many-body states to emerge directly when atoms are
transferred to Rydberg states. A key example are quantum crystals, composed of
coherent superpositions of different spatially ordered configurations of
collective excitations. Here we report on the direct measurement of strong
correlations in a laser excited two-dimensional atomic Mott insulator using
high-resolution, in-situ Rydberg atom imaging. The observations reveal the
emergence of spatially ordered excitation patterns in the high-density
components of the prepared many-body state. They have random orientation, but
well defined geometry, forming mesoscopic crystals of collective excitations
delocalised throughout the gas. Our experiment demonstrates the potential of
Rydberg gases to realise exotic phases of matter, thereby laying the basis for

multivariate continuous-time autoregressive moving average (MCARMA) process,
which is observed on the discrete time grid $(0,h,2h,...)$. Beginning with a
new state space representation, we develop a method to recover the driving
L\'evy process exactly from a continuous record of the observed MCARMA process.
We use tools from numerical analysis and the theory of infinitely divisible
distributions to extend this result to allow for the approximate recovery of
unit increments of the driving L\'evy process from discrete-time observations
of the MCARMA process. We show that, if the sampling interval $h=h_N$ is chosen
dependent on $N$, the length of the observation horizon, such that $N h_N$
converges to zero as $N$ tends to infinity, then any suitable generalized
method of moments estimator based on this reconstructed sample of unit
increments has the same asymptotic distribution as the one based on the true
increments, and is, in particular, asymptotically normally distributed.

disk size and emission wavelength provides evidence of the quantum confined
Stark effect leading to an emission below the bulk GaN band gap for disks
thicker than 2.6 nm. With the help of simulations, we show that the internal
electric field in the studied quantum disks is smaller than what is expected in
the quantum well case. We show evidence of a clear dispersion of the emission
wavelengths of different quantum disks of identical size but different

change of the diameter of the AlN shell coating the wire and is thus attributed
to the related strain variations along the wire. The present work opens the way
both to fundamental studies of quantum confinement in closely packed quantum

of many agents. If the shock hits only one agent initially and causes it to
fail, this can induce a cascade of failures among neighoring agents. Several
critical constellations determine whether this cascade remains finite or
reaches the size of the system, i.e. leads to systemic risk. We investigate the
critical parameters for such cascades in a simple model, where agents are
characterized by an individual threshold \theta_i determining their capacity to
handle a load \alpha\theta_i with 1-\alpha being their safety margin. If agents
fail, they redistribute their load equally to K neighboring agents in a regular
network. For three different threshold distributions P(\theta), we derive
analytical results for the size of the cascade, X(t), which is regarded as a
measure of systemic risk, and the time when it stops. We focus on two different
regimes, (i) EEE, an external extreme event where the size of the shock is of
the order of the total capacity of the network, and (ii) RIE, a random internal
event where the size of the shock is of the order of the capacity of an agent.
We find that even for large extreme events that exceed the capacity of the
network finite cascades are still possible, if a power-law threshold
distribution is assumed. On the other hand, even small random fluctuations may
lead to full cascades if critical conditions are met. Most importantly, we
demonstrate that the size of the ""big"" shock is not the problem, as the
systemic risk only varies slightly for changes of 10 to 50 percent of the
external shock. Systemic risk depends much more on ingredients such as the
network topology, the safety margin and the threshold distribution, which gives
hints on how to reduce systemic risk.

Single-mode analysis is adopted to reveal definite relation between the
nonlinear evolution of RMI and the field enhancement. It is found that an
ambient magnetic field is stretched by fluid motions associated with the RMI,
and the strength is amplified significantly by more than two orders of
magnitude. The saturation level of the field is determined by a balance between
the amplified magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure after shock passage.
This effective amplification can be achieved in a wide range of the conditions
for the RMI such as the Mach number of an incident shock and the density ratio
at a contact discontinuity. The results suggest that the RMI could be a robust
mechanism of the amplification of interstellar magnetic fields and cause the

explore the behavior of h_{uu} just outside the ""light ring"" at x=1/3, where
the circular orbit becomes null. Using the recently discovered link between
h_{uu} and the piece a(u), linear in the symmetric mass ratio \nu, of the main
radial potential A(u,\nu) of the Effective One Body (EOB) formalism, we compute
a(u) over the entire domain 0<u<1/3. We find that a(u) diverges at the

accurate global analytic fits for a(u), valid on the entire domain 0<u<1/3 (and

this hemizygosity is expected to drive unusual patterns of evolution on the X
relative to the autosomes. For example, the hemizgosity of the X may lead to a
lower chromosomal effective population size compared to the autosomes
suggesting that the X might be more strongly affected by genetic drift.
However, the X may also experience stronger positive selection than the
autosomes because recessive beneficial mutations will be more visible to
selection on the X where they will spend less time being masked by the
dominant, less beneficial allele - a proposal known as the faster-X hypothesis.
Thus, empirical studies demonstrating increased genetic divergence on the X
chromosome could be indicative of either adaptive or non-adaptive evolution. We
measured gene expression in Drosophila species and in D. melanogaster inbred
strains for both embryos and adults. In the embryos we found that expression
divergence is on average more than 20% higher for genes on the X chromosome
relative to the autosomes, but in contrast, in the inbred strains gene
expression variation is significantly lower on the X chromosome. Furthermore,
expression divergence of genes on Muller's D element is significantly greater
along the branch leading to the obscura sub-group, in which this element
segregates as a neo-X chromosome. In the adults, divergence is greatest on the
X chromosome for males, but not for females, yet in both sexes inbred strains
harbour the lowest level of gene expression variation on the X chromosome. We
consider different explanations for our results and conclude that they are most
consistent within the framework of the faster-X hypothesis.

monopole resonances. The problem is spatially unbounded as the resonance state
is in the continuum. The practical requirement to perform the calculation in a
finite-sized spatial region results in a difficulty with the spatial boundary
conditions. Here we propose a absorbing boundary condition scheme to handle the
conflict. The derivation, via a Laplace transform method, and implementation is
described. The accuracy and efficiency of the scheme is tested and the results
presented to support the case that they are a effective way of handling the
artificial boundary.

rate (sSFR), derived from the spectroscopic data obtained by SDSS DR4 are used
to show that the star formation activity in galaxies (M_r<=-20.5) found on the
outskirts (1-2r_{200}) of some nearby clusters (0.02<=z<=0.15) is enhanced. By
comparing the mean SFR of galaxies in a sample of clusters with at least one
starburst galaxy (log sSFR>=-10/yr & SFR>10 M_sun/yr) to a sample of clusters
without such galaxies (`comparison' clusters), we find that despite the
expected decline in the mean SFR of galaxies toward the cluster core, the SFR
profile of the two samples is different, such that the galaxies in the
`comparison' clusters show a lower mean SFR at all radius (<=3r_{200}) from the
cluster centre. Such an increase in the SFR of galaxies is more likely to be
seen in dynamically unrelaxed (sigma_v>~500 km/s) clusters. It is also evident
that these unrelaxed clusters are currently being assembled via galaxies
falling in through straight filaments, resulting in high velocity dispersions.
On the other hand, `comparison' clusters are more likely to be fed by
relatively low density filaments. We find that the starburst galaxies on the
periphery of clusters are in an environment of higher local density than other
cluster galaxies at similar radial distances from the cluster centre. We
conclude that a relatively high galaxy density in the infalling regions of
clusters promotes interactions amongst galaxies, leading to momentary bursts of
star formation. Such interactions play a crucial role in exhausting the fuel
for star formation in a galaxy, before it is expelled due to the environmental
processes that are operational in the dense interiors of the cluster.

penetrate $0.37H_P$ to the location where the temperature is $2.5\times10^6 K$
which is the typical temperature of the reaction $Li^7(p,\alpha)He^4$. This
indicates that the overshooting mixing should be involved in investigating the
solar Li abundance problem. Observations of Li abundance of solar-twins show
that the sun is not very peculiar. The overshooting mixing should be also
involved in investigating Li abundance in clusters. However, the fully
overshooting mixing with the length of $0.37H_P$ results in too much Li
depletion to fit the observation in the solar case. Therefore, using the
diffusive process to describe the overshooting is more suitable. The diffusive
overshooting approach requires the turbulent r.m.s. velocity in the
overshooting region to calculate the diffusion coefficient. Turbulent
convection models(TCMs), which are suggested by helioseimic investigation, can
provide the turbulent properties in the overshooting region. However, TCMs are
often too complex to be applied in the calculations of the stellar evolution.
It is an easier way to use the asymptotic solution of TCMs. In this paper, I
use the asymptotic solution of Li & Yang's TCM, which results in agreements in
both solar sound speed and solar Li abundance, to investigate Li abundance in
clusters(Hyades, Praesepe, NGC6633, NGC752, NGC3680 & M67). It is found that
the overshooting mixing leads to significant Li depletion in the old
clusters($t>1Gyr$) and little effect in the young clusters($t<1Gyr$).

where the optical spectrum contains lines associated with both the disc
photosphere and a wind component. Previous observations of the prototype FU
Orionis have suggested that the wind lines and the photospheric lines are
modulated with periods of 14.54 and 3.54 days respectively (Herbig et al.
2003). We have re-observed the system at higher spectral resolution, by
monitoring variations of optical line profiles over 21 nights in 2007 and have
found periods of 13.48 and 3.6 days in the wind and disc components consistent
with the above: this implies variability mechanisms that are stable over at
least a decade. In addition we have found: i) that the variations in the
photospheric absorption lines are confined to the blue wing of the line (around
-9km/s): we tentatively ascribe this to an orbiting hotspot in the disc which
is obscured by a disc warp during its receding phase. ii) The wind period is
manifested not only in blue-shifted Halpha absorption, but also in red-shifted
emission of Halpha and Hbeta, as well as in blue-shifted absorption of Na I D,
Li I and Fe II. iii) We find that the periodic modulation of blue-shifted
Halpha absorption at around -100km/s, is phase lagged with respect to
variations in the other lines by ~1.8days. This is consistent with a picture in
which variations at the wind base first affect chromospheric emission and then
low velocity blue-shifted absorption, followed - after a lag equal to the
propagation time of disturbances across the wind's acceleration region - by a
response in high velocity blue-shifted absorption. Such arguments constrain the
size of the acceleration region to ~10^12cm. We discuss possible mechanisms for
periodic variations within the innermost 0.1AU of the disc, including the
possibility that these variations indicate the presence of an embedded hot
Jupiter.

restructuring of the photospheric magnetic field during the flare close to the
polarity inversion line (PIL) at the flaring site. At two locations in the
umbra we encounter strong fields (approx. 3 kG), as inferred from the Stokes I
profiles which, however, exhibit a low polarization signal. During the flare we
observe in addition asymmetric Stokes V profiles at one of these sites. The
asymmetric Stokes V profiles appear co-spatial and co-temporal with a strong
apparent polarity reversal observed in MDI-magnetograms and a chromospheric
hard X-ray source. The two-component atmosphere fits of the asymmetric Stokes
profiles result in line-of-sight velocity differences in the range of approx.
12km/s to 14 km/s between the two components in the photosphere. Another
possibility is that local atmospheric heating is causing the observed
asymmetric Stokes V profile shape. In either case our analysis shows that a

localization of faulty axioms defined by a user while developing an ontology.
The ontology development process in this case is characterized by rather
frequent and regular calls to a reasoner resulting in an early user awareness
of modeling errors. In such a scenario an ontology usually includes only a
small number of conflict sets, i.e. sets of axioms preserving the faults. This
property allows efficient use of standard model-based diagnosis techniques
based on the application of hitting set algorithms to a number of given
conflict sets. However, in many use cases such as ontology alignment the
ontologies might include many more conflict sets than in usual ontology
development settings, thus making precomputation of conflict sets and
consequently ontology diagnosis infeasible. In this paper we suggest a
debugging approach based on a direct computation of diagnoses that omits
calculation of conflict sets. Embedded in an ontology debugger, the proposed
algorithm is able to identify diagnoses for an ontology which includes a large
number of faults and for which application of standard diagnosis methods fails.
The evaluation results show that the approach is practicable and is able to
identify a fault in adequate time.

Visualization plays an important role in the qualitative exploration, as well

  Objectives","Accepted for CSL-LICS 2014",,,,"cs.LO cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Two-player games on graphs provide the mathematical foundation for the study
of reactive systems. In the quantitative framework, an objective assigns a
value to every play, and the goal of player 1 is to minimize the value of the
objective. In this framework, there are two relevant synthesis problems to
consider: the quantitative analysis problem is to compute the minimal (or
infimum) value that player 1 can assure, and the boolean analysis problem asks
whether player 1 can assure that the value of the objective is at most $\nu$
(for a given threshold $\nu$). Mean-payoff expression games are played on a
multidimensional weighted graph. An atomic mean-payoff expression objective is
the mean-payoff value (the long-run average weight) of a certain dimension, and
the class of mean-payoff expressions is the closure of atomic mean-payoff
expressions under the algebraic operations of $\MAX,\MIN$, numerical complement
and $\SUM$. In this work, we study for the first time the strategy synthesis
problems for games with robust quantitative objectives, namely, games with
mean-payoff expression objectives. While in general, optimal strategies for
these games require infinite-memory, in synthesis we are typically interested
in the construction of a finite-state system. Hence, we consider games in which
player 1 is restricted to finite-memory strategies, and our main contribution
is as follows. We prove that for mean-payoff expressions, the quantitative
analysis problem is computable, and the boolean analysis problem is
inter-reducible with Hilbert's tenth problem over rationals --- a fundamental
long-standing open problem in computer science and mathematics.

lattice with effective nearest-neighbor transfer integral $t$ and on-site
repulsion $U$. Our study combines a number of numerical and theoretical
approaches, including, in addition to standard treatments, density matrix
renormalization group calculations for Hubbard cylinders and a suitable spinon
approach for the spin excitations. Our results confirm that the $U/8t$
magnitude suitable to LCO corresponds to intermediate $U$ values smaller than
the bandwidth $8t$, which we estimate to be $8t \approx 2.36$ eV for
$U/8t\approx 0.76$. This confirms the unsuitability of the conventional linear
spin-wave theory. Our theoretical studies provide evidence for the occurrence
of ground-state d-wave spinon pairing in the half-filled Hubbard model on the
square lattice. This pairing applies only to the rotated-electron spin degrees
of freedom, but it could play a role in a possible electron d-wave pairing
formation upon hole doping. We find that the higher-energy spin spectral weight
extends to about 566 meV and is located at and near the momentum $[\pi,\pi]$.
The continuum weight energy-integrated intensity vanishes or is extremely small
at momentum $[\pi,0]$. This behavior of this intensity is consistent with that
of the spin waves observed in recent high-energy neutron scattering
experiments, which are damped at the momentum $[\pi,0]$. We suggest that future
LCO neutron scattering experiments scan the energies between 450 meV and 566
meV and momenta around $[\pi,\pi]$.

X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), namely XTE J1810-197,
SGR 0501+4516, SGR 1627-41 and CXOU J164710.2-455216, can be produced by the
fallback disk model that was also applied to the outburst light curves of
persistent AXPs and SGRs in our earlier work. The model solves the diffusion
equation for the relaxation of a disk which has been pushed back by a soft
gamma-ray burst. The sets of main disk parameters used for these transient
sources are very similar to each other and to those employed in our earlier
models of persistent AXPs and SGRs. There is a characteristic difference
between the X-ray outburst light curves of transient and persistent sources.
This can be explained by the differences in the disk surface-density profiles
of the transient and persistent sources in quiescence indicated by their
quiescent X-ray luminosities. Our results imply that a viscous disk instability
operating at a critical temperature in ~ 1300 - 2800 K range is a common
property of all fallback disks around AXPs and SGRs. The effect of the
instability is more pronounced and starts earlier for the sources with lower
quiescent luminosities, which leads to the observable differences in the X-ray
enhancement light curves of transient and persistent sources. A single active
disk model with the same basic disk parameters can account for the enhancement
phases of both transient and persistent AXPs and SGRs. We also present a
detailed parameter study to show the effects of disk parameters on the
evolution of the X-ray luminosity of AXPs and SGRs in the X-ray enhancement
phases.

  Insulator Bi2Se3",,,"10.1038/nphys2685",,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Topological insulators are novel macroscopic quantum-mechanical phase of
matter, which hold promise for realizing some of the most exotic particles in
physics as well as application towards spintronics and quantum computation. In
all the known topological insulators, strong spin-orbit coupling is critical
for the generation of the protected massless surface states. Consequently, a
complete description of the Dirac state should include both the spin and
orbital (spatial) parts of the wavefunction. For the family of materials with a
single Dirac cone, theories and experiments agree qualitatively, showing the
topological state has a chiral spin texture that changes handedness across the
Dirac point (DP), but they differ quantitatively on how the spin is polarized.
Limited existing theoretical ideas predict chiral local orbital angular
momentum on the two sides of the DP. However, there have been neither direct
measurements nor calculations identifying the global symmetry of the spatial
wavefunction. Here we present the first results from angle-resolved
photoemission experiment and first-principles calculation that both show,
counter to current predictions, the in-plane orbital wavefunctions for the
surface states of Bi2Se3 are asymmetric relative to the DP, switching from
being tangential to the k-space constant energy surfaces above DP, to being
radial to them below the DP. Because the orbital texture switch occurs exactly
at the DP this effect should be intrinsic to the topological physics,
constituting an essential yet missing aspect in the description of the
topological Dirac state. Our results also indicate that the spin texture may be
more complex than previously reported, helping to reconcile earlier conflicting
spin resolved measurements.

convolutions of Bernoulli and Genocchi numbers, and derive some 2-adic

asynchronous network that is subject to Byzantine failures. Most existing
approaches give conditions for perfect reliable broadcast (all correct nodes
deliver the authentic message and nothing else), but they require a highly
connected network. An approach giving only probabilistic guarantees (correct
nodes deliver the authentic message with high probability) was recently
proposed for loosely connected networks, such as grids and tori. Yet, the
proposed solution requires a specific initialization (that includes global
knowledge) of each node, which may be difficult or impossible to guarantee in
self-organizing networks - for instance, a wireless sensor network, especially
if they are prone to Byzantine failures. In this paper, we propose a new
protocol offering guarantees for loosely connected networks that does not
require such global knowledge dependent initialization. In more details, we
give a methodology to determine whether a set of nodes will always deliver the
authentic message, in any execution. Then, we give conditions for perfect
reliable broadcast in a torus network. Finally, we provide experimental
evaluation for our solution, and determine the number of randomly distributed
Byzantine failures than can be tolerated, for a given correct broadcast
probability.
