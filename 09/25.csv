of star-forming regions (SFRs) are important for understanding star and planet
formation. While infrared observations reveal the evolutionary status of the
disk, optical spectroscopy is fundamental to acquire information on the
properties of the central star and on the accretion characteristics. 2MASS
archive data and the Spitzer c2d survey of the Chamaeleon II dark cloud have
provided disk properties of a large number of young stars. We complement these
data with spectroscopy with the aim of providing physical stellar parameters
and accretion properties. We use FLAMES/UVES+GIRAFFE observations of 40 members
of Cha II to measure radial velocities through cross-correlation technique, Li
abundances by means of curves of growth, and for a suitable star elemental
abundances of Fe, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, and Ni using the code MOOG. From the
equivalent widths of the Halpha, Hbeta, and the HeI-5876, 6678, 7065 Angstrom
emission lines, we estimate the mass accretion rates, dMacc/dt, for all the
objects. We derive a radial velocity distribution for the Cha II stars
(<Vrad>=11.4+-2.0 km/s). We find dMacc/dt prop. to Mstar^1.3 and to Age^(-0.82)
in the 0.1-1.0 Msun mass regime, and a mean dMacc/dt for Cha II of ~7*10^(-10)
Msun/yr. We also establish a relationship between the HeI-7065 Angstrom line
emission and the accretion luminosity. The radial velocity distributions of
stars and gas in Cha II are consistent. The spread in dMacc/dt at a given
stellar mass is about one order of magnitude and can not be ascribed entirely
to short timescale variability. Analyzing the relation between dMacc/dt and the
colors in Spitzer and 2MASS bands, we find indications that the inner disk
changes from optically thick to optically thin at dMacc/dt~10^(-10) Msun/yr.
Finally, the disk fraction is consistent with the age of Cha II.

favor of habitability. These satellites can receive more illumination per area
than their host planets, as the planet reflects stellar light and emits thermal

tidal heating can be very large on exomoons, possibly even large enough for

the recommendation problem for all the users if it wishes to update the
recommendations for only a single active. Further, BPRS computes the
recommendations for each user with linear complexity and without requiring a
training period. Via computer simulations (using the 100K MovieLens dataset),
we verify that BPRS iteratively reduces the error in the predicted ratings of
the users until it converges. Finally, we confirm that BPRS is comparable to
the state of art methods such as Correlation-based neighborhood model (CorNgbr)
and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) in terms of rating and precision
accuracy. Therefore, we believe that the BP-based recommendation algorithm is a
new promising approach which offers a significant advantage on scalability
while providing competitive accuracy for the recommender systems.

quasi-equilibrium approximation that includes a rotational velocity piece for
each star has been proposed to describe binary neutron stars with arbitrary

approximation numerically for the first time, to generate initial data for
neutron star binaries with spin. If we choose the rotational velocity piece
such that it equals the Newtonian rigid rotation law, we obtain stars with
fluid 4-velocities that have expansion and shear of approximately zero, as one
would expect for quasi-equilibrium configurations. We also use the new approach

overlapping stenosed artery under the action of an externally applied magnetic
field. The fluid (blood) medium is assumed to be porous in nature. The variable
viscosity of blood depending on hematocrit (percentage volume of erythrocytes)
is taken into account in order to improve resemblance to the real situation.
The governing equation for laminar, incompressible and Newtonian fluid subject
to the boundary conditions is solved by using a well known Frobenius method.
The analytical expressions for velocity component, volumetric flow rate, wall
shear stress and pressure gradient are obtained. The numerical values are
extracted from these analytical expressions and are presented graphically. It
is observed that the influence of hematocrit, magnetic field and the shape of
artery have important impact on the velocity profile, pressure gradient and
wall shear stress. Moreover, the effect of primary stenosis on the secondary
one has been significantly observed.

enhancement is achieved by several methods, and in particular by doping common

indicate that the electron spin density in the case of thin nanoscale magnetic

quantum many body theory-based, computational synthesis (i.e., virtual

that indeed, possess delocalized and polarized electron spin density. Such
delocalization provides a physical mechanism responsible for stabilization of
these nanoscale molecular magnets, and leads to the development of what can be
described as spin-polarized holes of the electron charge deficit. In some QDs,
numerical values of the electron spin density distribution are relatively

However, in standard formulations its mathematical structure is rather
different from the Yang-Mills fields of particle physics that govern the
electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. This paper explores this
dissonance with particular focus on how gravity couples to matter from the
perspective of the Cartan-geometric formulation of gravity. There the
gravitational field is represented by a pair of variables: 1) a `contact
vector' $V^A$ which is geometrically visualized as the contact point between
the spacetime manifold and a model spacetime being `rolled' on top of it, and
2) a gauge connection $A_{\mu}^{\ph\mu AB}$, taken to be valued in the Lie
algebra of SO(2,3) or SO(1,4), which mathematically determines how much the
model spacetime is rotated when rolled. By insisting on two principles, the
{\em gauge principle} and {\em polynomial simplicity}, we show how one can
reformulate the standard matter field actions in a way that is harmonious with
Cartan's geometric construction. This yields a formulation of all matter fields
in terms of first order partial differential equations. We show in detail how
the standard second order formulation can be recovered. Furthermore, the
energy-momentum and spin-density three-forms are naturally combined into a
single object here denoted the spin-energy-momentum three-form. Finally, we
highlight a peculiarity in the mathematical structure of our first-order
formulation of Yang-Mills fields. This suggests a way to unify a U(1) gauge
field with gravity into a SO(1,5)-valued gauge field using a natural
generalization of Cartan geometry in which the larger symmetry group is
spontaneously broken down to $SO(1,3)\times U(1)$. The coupling of this unified
theory to matter fields and possible extensions to non-Abelian gauge fields are
left as open questions.

propositional self-reference involve, in some way, paradoxical statements such
as the liar. However, the paradox disappears if one replaces classical by an
appropriate non-classical negation such as a paraconsistent one (no paradox
arises if the liar is both true and false). We consider a non-Fregean logic
which is a revised and extended version (Lewitzka 2012) of Epsilon-T-Logic
originally introduced by (Straeter 1992) as a logic with a total truth
predicate and propositional quantifiers. Self-reference is achieved by means of
equations between formulas which are interpreted over a model-theoretic
universe of propositions. Paradoxical statements, such as the liar, can be
asserted only by unsatisfiable equations and do not correlate with
propositions. In this paper, we generalize Epsilon-T-Logic to a four-valued
logic related to Dunn/Belnap logic B_4. We also define three-valued versions
related to Kleene's logic K_3 and Priest's Logic of Paradox P_3, respectively.
In this many-valued setting, models may contain liars and other ""paradoxical""
propositions which are ruled out by the more restrictive classical semantics.
We introduce these many-valued non-Fregean logics as extensions of abstract
parameter logics such that parameter logic and extension are of the same
logical type. For this purpose, we define and study abstract logics of type
B_4, K_3 and P_3. Using semantic methods we show compactness of the consequence
relation of abstract logics of type B_4, give a representation as minimally
generated logics and establish a connection to the approach of (Font 1997).
Finally, we present a complete sequent calculus for the Epsilon-T-style

the equipartition of energy among all degrees of freedom of the chaotic

their lifetime towards a single value. A compelling illustration of the theory

by considering four fundamental Gaussian network structures: wiretap channel,
broadcast channel with confidential messages, interference channel with
confidential messages, and multiple access wiretap channel. The secure d.o.f.
of the canonical Gaussian wiretap channel with no helpers is zero. It has been
known that a strictly positive secure d.o.f. can be obtained in the Gaussian
wiretap channel by using a helper which sends structured cooperative signals.
We show that the exact secure d.o.f. of the Gaussian wiretap channel with a
helper is 1/2. Our achievable scheme is based on real interference alignment
and cooperative jamming, which renders the message signal and the cooperative
jamming signal separable at the legitimate receiver, but aligns them perfectly
at the eavesdropper preventing any reliable decoding of the message signal. Our
converse is based on two key lemmas. The first lemma quantifies the secrecy
penalty by showing that the net effect of an eavesdropper on the system is that
it eliminates one of the independent channel inputs. The second lemma
quantifies the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between the
cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate. We extend this
result to the case of M helpers, and show that the exact secure d.o.f. in this
case is M/(M+1). We then generalize this approach to more general network
structures with multiple messages. We show that the sum secure d.o.f. of the
Gaussian broadcast channel with confidential messages and M helpers is 1, the
sum secure d.o.f. of the two-user interference channel with confidential
messages is 2/3, the sum secure d.o.f. of the two-user interference channel

discriminant model that selects predictive voxels on the reference task and
thus provides a principled procedure to define ROIs. The benefits of our
approach are twofold. First it uses the reference database for prediction, i.e.
to provide potential biomarkers in a clinical setting. Second it increases
statistical power on the new task. We demonstrate on a set of 18 pairs of
functional MRI experimental conditions that our approach gives good prediction.
In addition, on a specific transfer situation involving different scanners at
different locations, we show that voxel selection based on transfer learning
leads to higher detection power on small cohorts.

its spectroscopically well-sampled globular cluster (GC) system, the early-type
galaxy NGC 3115 provides one of the best available tests of whether the color
bimodality widely observed in GC systems generally reflects a true metallicity
bimodality. Color bimodality has alternatively been attributed to a strongly
nonlinear color--metallicity relation reflecting the influence of hot
horizontal branch stars. Here we couple Subaru Suprime-Cam gi photometry with
Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy to accurately measure GC colors and a CaT index that
measures the CaII triplet. We find the NGC 3115 GC system to be unambiguously
bimodal in both color and the CaT index. Using simple stellar population
models, we show that the CaT index is essentially unaffected by variations in
horizontal branch morphology over the range of metallicities relevant to GC
systems (and is thus a robust indicator of metallicity) and confirm bimodality
in the metallicity distribution. We assess the existing evidence for and
against multiple metallicity subpopulations in early and late-type galaxies and
conclude that metallicity bi/multimodality is common. We briefly discuss how

is, only the most luminous AGN phases are connected to major mergers, while

the M-\sigma relation for elliptical galaxies is significantly lower than in
spirals. The lack of a significant redshift dependence of the

stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function, when inferred from

use simulated star clusters to show that these effects are minimized when the
brightest, rapidly evolving stars in a cluster can be resolved, and the light
of the fainter, more numerous unresolved stars can be analyzed separately. When
comparing the light from the less luminous cluster members to models of
unresolved light, more accurate age estimates can be obtained than when
analyzing the integrated light from the entire cluster under the assumption
that the initial mass function is fully populated. We show the success of this
technique first using simulated clusters, and then with a stellar cluster in

dust-rich sublayers encased in gas. What densities must the particle sublayer
attain before it can fragment by self-gravity? We describe various candidate
threshold densities. One of these is the Roche density, which is that required
for a strengthless satellite to resist tidal disruption by its primary. Another
is the Toomre density, which is that required for de-stabilizing self-gravity
to defeat the stabilizing influences of pressure and rotation. We show that for
sublayers containing aerodynamically well-coupled dust, the Toomre density
exceeds the Roche density by many (up to about 4) orders of magnitude. We
present 3D shearing box simulations of self-gravitating, stratified, dust-gas
mixtures to test which of the candidate thresholds is relevant for collapse.
All our simulations indicate that the larger Toomre density is required for
collapse. This result is sensible because sublayers are readily stabilized by
pressure. Sound-crossing times for thin layers are easily shorter than
free-fall times, and the effective sound speed in dust-gas suspensions
decreases only weakly with the dust-to-gas ratio (as the inverse square root).
Our findings assume that particles are small enough that their stopping times
in gas are shorter than all other timescales. Relaxing this assumption may
lower the threshold for gravitational collapse back down to the Roche
criterion. In particular, if the particle stopping time becomes longer than the
sound-crossing time, sublayers may lose pressure support and become
gravitationally unstable.

simulations described by Brightman & Nandra. This is essential to account for
the Compton scattering of X-ray photons in a dense medium and the impact of
that process on the spectra of obscured AGN. We identify a small number of
input parameters to the XRB synthesis code which encapsulate the minimum level
of uncertainty in reconstructing the XRB spectrum. These are the power-law
index and high energy cutoff of the intrinsic X-ray spectra of AGN, the level
of the reflection component in AGN spectra and the fraction of CT AGN in the
Universe. We then map the volume of the space allowed to these parameters by
current observations of the XRB spectrum in the range 3-100 keV. One of the
least constrained parameters is the fraction of CT AGN. Statistically
acceptable fits to the XRB spectrum at the 68% confidence level can be obtained
for CT fractions in the range 5-50%. This is because of degeneracies among
input parameters to the XRB synthesis code and uncertainties in the modeling of
AGN spectra (e.g. reflection). The most promising route for constraining the
fraction of CT AGN in the Universe is via the direct detection of those sources
in high energy (>10keV) surveys. It is shown that the observed fraction of CT
sources identified in the SWIFT/BAT survey, limits the intrinsic fraction of CT
AGN, at least at low redshift, to 10-20% (68% confidence level). We also make
predictions on the number density of CT sources that current and future X-ray
missions are expected to discover. Testing those predictions will constrain the
intrinsic fraction of CT AGN as a function of redshift.

The corresponding energy densities of the BPS solutions of the two models are
identical. A further consequence of the duality is that the dual BPS vortex
models inherit the BPS property and the infinitely many symmetries (APDs) of
the BPS baby Skyrme models. Finally, we demonstrate that the same topological
duality continues to hold for the U(1) gauged versions of the models.

recently, especially when the points z_i are real. Since the rational normal
curve has an action of PGL_2, it is natural to consider the points (z_1, ...,
z_r) as living in the moduli space of r distinct point in P^1 -- the famous
M_{0,r}. One can then ask to extend the results on Schubert intersections to
the compactification \bar{M}_{0,r}.
  The first part of this paper achieves this goal. We construct a flat,
Cohen-Macaulay family over \bar{M}_{0,r}, whose fibers over M_{0,r} are
isomorphic to G(d,n) and, given partitions lambda_1, ..., lambda_r, we

by networks are crucial in various phenomena, as in diseases such as epilepsy

triggering and inhibition processes, but they cannot be applied to social
networks where inhibition is clearly absent. A recent model showed that
contained activity can be achieved with no need of inhibition processes
provided that the network is subdivided in modules (communities). In this
paper, we introduce a new concept inspired in the Hebbian theory through which
activity contention is reached by incorporating a dynamics based on a decaying
activity in a random walk mechanism preferential to the node activity. Upon
selecting the decay coefficient within a proper range, we observed sustained
activity in all the networks tested, viz. random, Barabasi-Albert and
geographical networks. The generality of this finding was confirmed by showing
that modularity is no longer needed if the dynamics based on the
integrate-and-fire dynamics incorporated the decay factor. Taken together,
these results provide a proof of principle that persistent, restrained network
activation might occur in the absence of any particular topological structure.
This may be the reason why neuronal activity does not outspread to the entire
neuronal network, even when no special topological organization exists.

corrections, and unlike conventional symmetry breaking where the Higgs mass is
a parameter, the radiatively-generated Higgs mass is dynamically predicted.
Pade approximations and an averaging method are developed to extend the Higgs
mass predictions in radiative electroweak symmetry breaking from five- to
nine-loop order in the scalar sector of the Standard Model, resulting in an
upper bound on the Higgs mass of 141 GeV. The mass predictions are
well-described by a geometric series behaviour, converging to an asymptotic
Higgs mass of 124 GeV consistent with the recent ATLAS/CMS observations.
Similarly, we find that the Higgs self-coupling converges to $\lambda=0.23$,
which is significantly larger than its conventional symmetry breaking
counterpart for a 124 GeV Higgs mass. In addition to this significant
enhancement of the Higgs self-coupling and $HH\rightarrow HH$ scattering, we
find that Higgs decays to gauge bosons are unaltered and the scattering
processes $W_{L}^{+}W_{L}^{+}\rightarrow HH$, $Z_{L}Z_{L}\rightarrow HH$ are
also enhanced, providing signals to distinguish conventional and radiative
electroweak symmetry breaking mechanisms.

caused by a higher nuclear gas column due to mergers and/or a viewing angle

consistent with the ULIRG scenario, as is the presence of a companion galaxy at
a separation of about 11 kpc. The limits on radio afterglow emission, in
conjunction with the observed X-ray and optical emission, require a circumburst
density of ~10^-3 cm^-3 an isotropic-equivalent energy scale of E_gamma,iso ~
E_K,iso ~ 7x10^51 erg, and a jet opening angle of >8 deg. The expected fraction
of luminous infrared galaxies in the short GRB host sample is ~0.01-0.3 (for
pure stellar mass and star formation weighting, respectively). Thus, the
observed fraction of 2 events in about 25 hosts (GRBs 120804A and 100206A),
provides additional support to our previous conclusion that short GRBs track
both stellar mass and star formation activity.

discreteness of the emitters the flux and nuclear composition is expected to
show ensemble fluctuations on top of the statistical variations, i.e. ""cosmic

the limited propagation distance in the cosmic radiation background and is

unit, communication unit, data receiving and processing unit and billing
system. For reading unit we identified the disk rotation of the energy meter
and stored the data in microcontroller. So it is not required to change the
current analog energy meter. An external module will be added with the current
energy meter. In the communication unit Wimax transceiver was used for wireless

value of ~25% at >=M5 (M<=0.2 Msun), in agreement with the results of previous

the lifetimes of disks are longer at lower stellar masses, and that a

Finally, we demonstrate that the distribution of excess sizes in Upper Sco and
the much younger Taurus star-forming region (~1 Myr) are consistent with the

coupling energy between the s-wave superconductor and one of the s+- bands
dominates, s-wave gap parameter aligns with the order parameter in this band.
In this case the partial Josephson energies have different signs corresponding
to signs of the gap parameters. In the case of strong frustration,
corresponding to almost complete compensation of the total Josephson energy, a
nontrivial time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB) state realizes. In this state
all gap parameters become essentially complex. As a consequence, this state
provides realization for so-called \phi-junction with finite phase difference

than that of the world record giraffe and five times longer than those of all
other terrestrial animals. Several anatomical features enabled this extreme
elongation, including: absolutely large body size and quadrupedal stance
providing a stable platform for a long neck; a small, light head that did not
orally process food; cervical vertebrae that were both numerous and
individually elongate; an efficient air-sac-based respiratory system; and
distinctive cervical architecture. Relevant features of sauropod cervical
vertebrae include: pneumatic chambers that enabled the bone to be positioned in
a mechanically efficient way within the envelope; and muscular attachments of
varying importance to the neural spines, epipophyses and cervical ribs. Other
long-necked tetrapods lacked important features of sauropods, preventing the
evolution of longer necks: for example, giraffes have relatively small torsos
and large, heavy heads, share the usual mammalian constraint of only seven
cervical vertebrae, and lack an air-sac system and pneumatic bones. Among
non-sauropods, their saurischian relatives the theropod dinosaurs seem to have
been best placed to evolve long necks, and indeed they probably surpassed those
of giraffes. But 150 million years of evolution did not suffice for them to

spiral galaxy NGC 2903. The Chandra data reveal soft (kT_e ~ 0.2-0.5keV)
diffuse emission in the nuclear starburst region and extending ~5kpc to the
north and west of the nucleus. Much of this soft hot gas is likely to be from
local active star-forming regions; however, besides the nuclear region, the
morphology of hot gas does not strongly correlate with sites of active star
formation. The central ~650 pc radius starburst zone exhibits much higher
surface brightness diffuse emission than the surrounding regions and a harder
spectral component in addition to its soft component. We interpret the hard
component as being of thermal origin with kT_e~3.6keV and to be directly
associated with a wind fluid produced by supernovae and massive star winds. The
inferred terminal velocity for this hard component, ~1100 km/s, exceeds the
local galaxy escape velocity suggesting a potential outflow. The softer
extended emission does not display an obvious outflow geometry. However, the
column density through which the X-rays are transmitted is lower to the west of
the nucleus compared to the east and the surface brightness is higher there
suggesting some soft hot gas originates from above the disk; viewed directly
from the western zone but through the intervening galaxy disk from the eastern
zone. There are several point-like sources in the nuclear region with X-ray
spectra typical of compact binaries. None of these are coincident with the mass
center of the galaxy and we place an upper limit luminosity from any point-like
nuclear source to be < 2x10^38 ergs/s in the 0.5-8.0keV band which indicates
that NGC 2903 lacks an active galactic nucleus. Heating from the nuclear
starburst and a galactic wind may be responsible for preventing cold gas from
accreting onto the galactic center.

find nuclear B-band and R-band apparent magnitudes of 20.96 and 19.93 mag,

The geometric cross-section of material in the trail was ~ 4 x 10^8 m^2,

taken by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer in September 2010 reveals that
the object was below the detection limit, suggesting that it was less active

we propose a pair of matroids, namely predecessor relation matroid and
successor relation matroid, respectively. Basic characteristics of this pair of
matroids, such as dependent sets, circuits, the rank function and the closure
operator, are described by the predecessor and successor neighborhoods from

the matroid. We prove that the induced relation is always an equivalence
relation. With these two inductions, a relation induces a relation matroid, and
the relation matroid induces an equivalence relation, then the connection
between the original relation and the induced equivalence relation is studied.
Moreover, the relationships between the upper approximation operator in

that exploits asymmetry of meiosis to preferentially transmit itself and other
chromosomes containing specialized heterochromatic regions called knobs. The
structure and diversity of the Ab10 meiotic drive haplotype is poorly
understood. We developed a BAC library from an Ab10 line and used the data to
develop sequence-based markers, focusing on the proximal portion of the
haplotype that shows partial homology to normal chromosome 10. These molecular
and additional cytological data demonstrate that two previously identified Ab10
variants (Ab10-I and Ab10-II) share a common origin. Dominant PCR markers were
used with FISH to assay 160 diverse teosinte and maize landrace populations
from across the Americas, resulting in the identification of a previously
unknown but prevalent form of Ab10 (Ab10-III). We find that Ab10 occurs in at
least 75% of teosinte populations at a mean frequency of 15%. Ab10 was also
found in 13% of the maize landraces, but does not appear to be fixed in any
wild or cultivated population. Quantitative analyses suggest that the abundance
and distribution of Ab10 is governed by a complex combination of intrinsic
fitness effects as well as extrinsic environmental variability.

during different sessions significantly deteriorates the accuracy of most
brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Moreover these variabilities, also
known as inter-subject or inter-session variabilities, require lengthy
calibration sessions before the BCI system can be used. Furthermore, the
calibration session has to be repeated for each subject independently and
before use of the BCI due to the inter-session variability. In this study, we
present an algorithm in order to minimize the above-mentioned variabilities and
to overcome the time-consuming and usually error-prone calibration time. Our
algorithm is based on linear programming support-vector machines and their
extensions to a multiple kernel learning framework. We tackle the inter-subject
or -session variability in the feature spaces of the classifiers. This is done
by incorporating each subject- or session-specific feature spaces into much
richer feature spaces with a set of optimal decision boundaries. Each decision
boundary represents the subject- or a session specific spatio-temporal
variabilities of neural signals. Consequently, a single classifier with
multiple feature spaces will generalize well to new unseen test patterns even
without the calibration steps. We demonstrate that classifiers maintain good
performances even under the presence of a large degree of BCI variability. The
present study analyzes BCI variability related to oxy-hemoglobin neural signals
measured using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy.

The quantum dot molecule qubit enables a new strategy for optical coherent
control with dramatically enhanced wavelength tunability. The use of hole spins
allows the suppression of decoherence via hyperfine interactions and enables
coherent spin rotations using Raman transitions mediated by a hole-spin-mixed
optically excited state. Because the spin mixing is present only in the
optically excited state, dephasing and decoherence are strongly suppressed in
the ground states that define the qubits and nondestructive readout is
possible. We present the qubit and device designs and analyze the wavelength
tunability and fidelity of gate operations that can be implemented using this
strategy. We then present experimental and theoretical progress toward
implementing this design.

detected the source in near-IR JH bands and Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m mid-IR

the IR emission is found to arise from the companion star, with no excess
emission detected in the wavelength range. Because our near-IR fluxes are
nearly equal to those obtained by the 2MASS all-sky survey in 2000 Feb., the
result indicates that the binary did not contain the accretion disk at the

independence in vector spaces. Further, matroid theory borrows extensively from
the terminology of linear algebra and graph theory. We can combine rough set
theory with matroid theory through using rough sets to study some
characteristics of matroids. In this paper, we apply rough sets to matroids

the family of sets satisfies the support set axioms of matroids, and then we
obtain a matroid. We say the matroids induced by the equivalence relation and a
type of matroid, namely support matroid, is induced. Second, through rough
sets, some characteristics of matroids such as independent sets, support sets,

water-maser velocity-components is about 8 months. The components showed
velocity fluctuations with a typical drift rate of about 0.01 km/s/day. The
methanol class I masers were detected toward FIR 6. The methanol emission is
confined within a narrow range around the systemic velocity of the FIR 6 cloud
core. The methanol masers suggest the existence of shocks driven by either the
expanding H II region of FIR 6c or the outflow of FIR 6n.

neutrino of a given flavor in fact does not satisfy the Dirac equation (which
is used to define the mass eigen-states and mass eigen-values). This alters the
basic treatment of neutrino oscillations, in that the Dirac spinors are defined
as the mass eigen-states while the flavor states can only be given as linear
combinations of the mass eigen-states (of Dirac equations). Even though
neutrino masses are tiny, the impacts of several neutrino masses in a single
reaction or a single decay, such as possible violation of the energy-momentum
conservation, should not be overlooked.
  Among those sources of oscillating neutrinos, we point out that the ultra
high energy cosmic rays (UHECR's) such as the proton of energy $10^{18}\, eV$
or higher, used to think of being rather stable, can capture, in the matter
media, an electron to convert into an electron-like neutrino and a spectator
neutron. This would be the most important neutrino source of the UHECR origin.

spectral functions, including the spectral current density, of a chiral p-wave

reveal the subtle role of the chiral edge states in relation to the edge
current and the angular momentum of a chiral p-wave superfluid, including the
rapid suppression of $L_z(T)$ for $0 \lesssim T\ll T_c$ in the fully gapped 2D
chiral superfluid. The edge current and ground-state angular momentum are shown
to be sensitive to boundary conditions, and as a consequence the topology and
geometry of the confining boundaries. For perfect specular boundaries the edge
current accounts for the ground-state angular momentum, $L_z=(N/2)\hbar$, of a
cylindrical disk of chiral superfluid with $N/2$ fermion pairs. Non-specular
scattering can dramatically suppress the edge current. In the limit of perfect
retro-reflection the edge states form a flat band of zero modes that are
non-chiral and generate no edge current. For a chiral superfluid film confined
in a cylindrical toroidal geometry the ground-state angular momentum is, in
general, non-extensive, and can have a value ranging from $L_z > (N/2)\hbar$ to
$L_z < -(N/2)\hbar$ depending on the ratio of the inner and outer radii and the
degree of back scattering on the inner and outer surfaces. Non-extensive
scaling of $L_z$, and the reversal of the ground-state angular momentum for a
toroidal geometry, would provide a signature of broken time-reversal symmetry

norm. So defecting agents face a social pressure, which decreases if
free-riding becomes widespread. In this model, diversity among agents naturally
appears because of the different sensitivity towards the social norm. We study
the evolution of cooperation as a response to the social norm (i) for the
replicator dynamics, and (ii) for the logit dynamics by means of numerical
simulations. Diversity-induced resonance is observed as a maximum in the
response of agents to changes in the social norm as a function of the degree of
heterogeneity in the population. We provide an analytical, mean-field approach
for the logit dynamics and find very good agreement with the simulations. From
a socio-economic perspective, our results show that, counter-intuitively,
diversity in the individual sensitivity to social norms may result in a society

  Our survey with the IRAM-30m detected 33 galaxies out of 69, and we derive a

gas fraction and SFE have comparable evolution, when we adopt the low starburst
conversion factor of \alpha =0.8 Mo/(K km/s pc^2). Adopting a higher \alpha
will increase the role of the gas fraction.
  Using \alpha =0.8, the SFE and the gas fraction for z=0.2-1.0 ULIRGs are

usually supposed that the above-barrier current in Schottky barriers on p-type
semiconductor is controlled only by the heavy holes. However, in real
structures, there is an additional potential barrier caused by a oxide layer at
interface. For typical values of thickness and height of a barrier its tunnel
transparency for light holes can be higher by three order of magnitude than
that for heavy holes. Due to such separative role of insulator layer one can
expect that the current is manly a contribution of light holes. To clear up
this problem the investigation of transport in a magnetic field is used as a
key experiment in this work. The pronounced magnetic field effect for heavy
holes in investigated Pb-p-HgCdTe Schottky barriers is expected only at
extremely strong magnetic fields B>10 T within the framework of both diode and
diffusion mechanism of transport. At the same time experimentally more than
twofold decrease in saturation current is observed even at B=0.5 T at any
orientation of magnetic field. The studies performed for HgCdTe with different
Kane's gap and at different temperatures show that the magnitude of magnetic
field effect is uniquely determined by the ratio of light hole cyclotron energy
to a thermal energy. However the magnitude of effect exceeds considerably the
prediction of the simple theory and the experimental magnetic field
dependencies of a saturation current do not follow the simple exponential
falling predicted for thermionic current. The reason of this discrepancy
remains a mystery.

adiabaticity in the inverse sweep is intricate, as the transfer of bosons is
non-monotonic as a function of both sweep time and intra-leg tunnel coupling.
Our exact study provides explanations for these non-monotonicities based on
features of the full spectrum, without appealing to concepts (e.g., gapless
excitation spectrum) that are more appropriate for the thermodynamic limit. We
also demonstrate and study Stueckelberg oscillations in the finite-size

flux from dark matter annihilations or decays is, however, severely constrained
by the non-observation of an excess in the antiproton-to-proton fraction
measured by PAMELA. In this paper we calculate, for representative dark matter

in agreement with the PAMELA data. To this end, we first analyze in detail the

find that the resulting coalescence momentum shows a dependence on the

calculate, using a diffusion model, the flux of antideuterons at the Earth from

Zipf's law and can be characterized with the rank-size rule. A model of spatial
disaggregation of urban space is presented to depict the spatial regularity of
urban growth. By recursive subdivision of space, an urban region can be
geometrically divided into two parts, four parts, eight parts, and so on, and
form a hierarchy with cascade structure. If we rank these parts by size, the

applied to three cities of China. The results show that the intra-urban
hierarchy complies with Zipf's law, and the values of the rank-size scaling
exponent are very close to 1. The significance of this study lies in three
aspects. First, it shows that the strict subdivision of space is an efficient
approach to revealing spatial order of urban form. Second, it discloses the

transformation (e.g. Fourier transform), I find that scaling analysis, spectral
analysis, and spatial correlation analysis are all associated with fractal
concepts and can be integrated into a new approach to fractal analysis of
cities. This method can be termed 3S analyses of urban form. Using the 3S
analysis, I derived a set of fractal parameter equations, by which different
fractal parameters of cities can be linked up with one another. Each fractal
parameter has its own reasonable extent of values. According to the fractal
parameter equations, the intersection of the rational ranges of different
fractal parameters suggests the proper scale of the fractal dimension of urban
patterns, which varies from 1.5 to 2. The fractal dimension equations based on

dynamic ranges needed for the complex source morphology of M82. This data was
combined with archival VLA data, yielding total power maps at 3cm, 6cm, 22cm
and 92cm. The data shows a confinement of the emission at wavelengths of 3/6cm
to the core region and a largely extended halo reaching up to 4kpc away from
the galaxy midplane at wavelengths of 22/92cm up to a sensitivity limit of
90muJy and 1.8mJy respectively. The results are used to calculate the magnetic
field strength in the core region to 98muG and to 24muG in the halo regions.
From the observation of free-free losses the filling factor of the ionised
medium could be estimated to 2%. We find that the radio emission from the core
region is dominated by very dense HII-regions and supernova remnants, while the
surrounding medium is filled with hot X-ray and neutral gas. Cosmic rays
radiating at frequencies higher than 1.4 GHz are suffering from high
synchrotron and inverse Compton losses in the core region and are not able to
reach the halo. Even the cosmic rays radiating at longer wavelengths are only
able to build up the observed kpc sized halo, when several starbursting periods
are assumed where the photon field density varies by an order of magnitude.
These findings together with the strong correlation between Halpha, PAH+, and
our radio continuum data suggests a magnetic field which is frozen into the
ionised medium and driven out of the galaxy kinematically.

techniques for simulating geothermal systems. In terms of efficiency and
accuracy, the exponential Rosenbrock--Euler time integrator has advantages over
standard time-dicretization schemes, which suffer from time-step restrictions
or excessive numerical diffusion when advection processes are dominating. Based
on linearization of the equation at each time step, we make use of matrix
exponentials of the Jacobian from the spatial discretization, which provide the
exact solution in time for the linearized equations. This is at the expense of
computing the matrix exponentials of the stiff Jacobian matrix, together with
propagating a linearized system. However, using a Krylov subspace or Leja
points techniques make these computations efficient. The Rosenbrock-type
methods use the appropriate rational functions of the Jacobian from the spatial
discretization. The parameters in these schemes are found in consistency with
the required order of convergence in time. As a result, these schemes are
A-stable and only a few linear systems are solved at each time step.
  The efficiency of the methods compared to standard time-discretization
techniques are demonstrated in numerical examples.

aspects of the form and function of the nervous system have been understood
using the concepts of optimal population coding. Most studies, however, have
neglected the aspect of temporal coding. Here we address this shortcoming
through a filtering theory of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. We derive exact
relations for the minimal mean squared error of the optimal Bayesian filter and
by optimizing the encoder, obtain optimal codes for populations of neurons. We
also show that a class of non-Markovian, smooth stimuli are amenable to the
same treatment, and provide results for the filtering and prediction error
which hold for a general class of stochastic processes. This sets a sound
mathematical framework for a population coding theory that takes temporal
aspects into account. It also formalizes a number of studies which discussed
temporal aspects of coding using time-window paradigms, by stating them in
terms of correlation times and firing rates. We propose that this kind of
analysis allows for a systematic study of temporal coding and will bring
further insights into the nature of the neural code.

primordial thermal velocities of fermionic dark matter particles affect the

they collect. The initial particle velocities induce central cores in both
profiles, which can be understood in the framework of phase space density
theory. We find that the maximum coarse-grained phase space density of the
simulated haloes (computed in 6 dimensional phase space using the EnBid code)
is very close to the theoretical fine-grained upper bound, while the pseudo
phase space density, Q ~ {\rho}/{\sigma}^3, overestimates the maximum phase
space density by up to an order of magnitude. The density in the inner regions
of the simulated haloes is well described by a 'pseudo-isothermal' profile with
a core. We have developed a simple model based on this profile which, given the
observed surface brightness profile of a galaxy and its central velocity
dispersion, accurately predicts its central phase space density. Applying this
model to the dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way yields values close
to 0.5 keV for the mass of a hypothetical thermal warm dark matter particle,
assuming the satellite haloes have cores produced by warm dark matter free
streaming. Such a small value is in conflict with the lower limit of 1.2 keV
set by observations of the Lyman-{\alpha} forest. Thus, if the Milky Way dwarf
spheroidal satellites have cores, these are likely due to baryonic processes
associated with the forming galaxy, perhaps of the kind proposed by Navarro,

magnitude the known processing time of each element in the stream, which is
extremely crucial for data stream applications. For example, for a sample of
size $O(\epsilon^{-2} \log{(1/\delta)})$ in Non-strict streams, our solution
requires $O((\log\log(1/\epsilon))^2 + (\log\log(1/\delta)) ^ 2)$ operations
per stream element, whereas the best previous solution requires
$O(\epsilon^{-2} \log^2(1/\delta))$ evaluations of a fully independent hash
function per element. Here $1-\delta$ is the success probability and $\epsilon$

  We achieve this improvement by constructing a single data structure from
which multiple elements can be extracted with very high success probability.
The sample we generate is useful for calculating both forward and inverse
distribution statistics, within an additive error, with provable guarantees on

approaches to an asymptotic form, which is probed by the neutrino. The whole
process is described by an S-matrix of a finite-time interval, which couples
with states of non-conserving kinetic energy, and the final states of a broad

Existing rules are usually evaluated through two measures, namely support and
confidence. However, these two measures may not be enough to describe the
strength of a rule. In this paper, we introduce granular association rules with
four measures to reveal connections between granules in two universes, and
propose three algorithms for rule mining. An example of such a rule might be
""40% men like at least 30% kinds of alcohol; 45% customers are men and 6%
products are alcohol."" Here 45%, 6%, 40%, and 30% are the source coverage, the
target coverage, the source confidence, and the target confidence,
respectively. With these measures, our rules are semantically richer than
existing ones. Three subtypes of rules are obtained through considering special
requirements on the source/target confidence. Then we define a rule mining
problem, and design a sandwich algorithm with different rule checking
approaches for different subtypes. Experiments on a real world dataset show
that the approaches dedicated to three subtypes are 2-3 orders of magnitudes
faster than the one for the general case. A forward algorithm and a backward
algorithm for one particular subtype can speed up the mining process further.

data mining. In real-world applications, costs, including money, time and other
resources, are required to acquire the features. In some cases, there is a test
cost constraint due to limited resources. We shall deliberately select an
informative and cheap feature subset for classification. This paper proposes
the feature selection with test cost constraint problem for this issue. The new
problem has a simple form while described as a constraint satisfaction problem
(CSP). Backtracking is a general algorithm for CSP, and it is efficient in
solving the new problem on medium-sized data. As the backtracking algorithm is
not scalable to large datasets, a heuristic algorithm is also developed.
Experimental results show that the heuristic algorithm can find the optimal
solution in most cases. We also redefine some existing feature selection
problems in rough sets, especially in decision-theoretic rough sets, from the
viewpoint of CSP. These new definitions provide insight to some new research
directions.

repressive transcription regulation. Such systems have distinctive
characteristics in comparison with ordinary chemical systems: i) the numbers of
molecules involved are small, ii) there are typically only a couple of genes in
a cell with a finite regulation time scale. Due to the fluctuations caused by
these features, the system behavior can be quite different from the one
obtained by rate equations, because the rate equations ignore molecular
fluctuations and thus are exact only in the infinite molecular number limit.
The molecular fluctuations on a free-running circadian system have been studied
by Gonze et al. (2002) by introducing a scale parameter $\Omega$ for the system
size. They consider, however, only the first effect, assuming that the gene
process is fast enough for the second effect to be ignored, but this has not
been examined systematically yet. In this work, we study fluctuation effects
due to the finite gene regulation time by introducing a new scale parameter
$\tau$, which we take as the unbinding time of a nuclear protein from the gene.
We focus on the case where the fluctuations due to small molecular numbers can
be ignored. In simulations on the same system studied by Gonze et al., we find
the system is sensitive to the fluctuation in the transcription regulation; the
period of oscillation fluctuates about 30 min even when the regulation time
scale $\tau$ is around 30 s, that is even smaller than 1/1000 of its circadian
period. We also demonstrate that the distribution width for the oscillation
period and the amplitude scales with $\sqrt\tau$, and the correlation time of
the oscillation scales with $1/\tau$ in the small $\tau$ regime. The relative
fluctuations for the period are about half of that for the amplitude, namely,
the periodicity is more stable than the amplitude.

force-free magnetic structure extending above a single, known lower-boundary

knowledge of the three-dimensional field configuration but is general enough to
employ only a magnetic connectivity matrix on the lower boundary. The
calculation yields a minimum free magnetic energy and a relative magnetic
helicity consistent with this free magnetic energy. The method is directly
applicable to photospheric or chromospheric vector magnetograms of solar active
regions. Upon validation, it basically reproduces magnetic energies and
helicities obtained by well-known, but computationally more intensive and
non-unique, methods relying on the extrapolated three-dimensional magnetic
field vector. We apply the method to three active regions, calculating the
photospheric connectivity matrices by means of simulated annealing, rather than
a model-dependent nonlinear force-free extrapolation. For two of these regions
we correct for the inherent linear force-free overestimation in free energy and
relative helicity that is larger for larger, more eruptive, active regions. In
the third studied region, our calculation can lead to a physical interpretation
of observed eruptive manifestations. We conclude that the proposed method,

practical enough to contribute to a physical interpretation of the dynamical

efficient trigger system in order to reduce systematic uncertainties. The
trigger and timing system of the Double Chooz experiment was designed according
to this goal. The Double Chooz trigger system is driven by the basic idea of
triggering on multiple thresholds according to the total visible energy and
additionally triggering on the number of active photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) in
the detector. To do so, the trigger system continuously monitors the analogue
signals from all PMTs in the detector. The amplitudes of these PMT-signals are
summed for groups of certain PMTs (group signals) and for all PMTs (sum
signal), respectively. The group signals are discriminated by two thresholds
for each input channel and four thresholds for the sum signal. The resulting
signals are processed by the trigger logic unit which is implemented in a FPGA.
In addition to the proper trigger, the trigger system provides a common clock
signal for all subsequent data acquisition systems to guarantee a synchronous
readout of the Double Chooz detectors. The present design of the system
provides a high flexibility for the applied logic and settings, making it
useful for experiments other than Double Chooz. The Double Chooz trigger and
timing system was installed and commissioned in 2011. This article describes
the hardware of the trigger and timing system. Furthermore the setup,
implemented trigger logic and performance of the trigger and timing system for

Franck-Condon picture. This includes signatures in both the resonant and the
non-resonant transport regime. Moreover, it is shown that local cooling by
electron-hole pair creation processes can influence the transport
characteristics profoundly, giving rise to a significant temperature dependence
of the electrical current.

virtual-state spectroscopy [Saleh et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 80, 3483, 1998], a
two-photon absorption spectroscopic technique that can retrieve information
about the energy level structure of an atom or a molecule. The consideration of
closely related techniques, such as multidimensional pump-probe spectroscopy
[Roslyak et al, Phys. Rev. A 79, 063409, 2009], might suggest that
spectroscopic information retrieved in the two-photon absorption process is the
same regardless of the classical or quantum nature of the light source. Here,
we solve this debate by making use of a full quantum formalism to show that the
ability to obtain information about the energy level structure of a medium
requires the existence of temporal (frequency) correlations between the
absorbed photons. Moreover, we show that these correlations are not the only
requisite for retrieving such information. In fact, it is a combination of
both, the presence of frequency correlations and its specific spectral shape,
which makes the realization of two-photon virtual-state spectroscopy possible.
This result helps clarifying the discussion whether entanglement is needed or
not, and also, to specify the type of two-photon source that needs to be used
in order to experimentally perform the two-photon virtual-state spectroscopy
technique.

wind-wind collisions occurring inside a binary system. One such case, the
O-type star Cyg OB2 #9, was proven to be a binary only four years ago, but the
orbital parameters remained uncertain. The periastron passage of 2011 was the
first one to be observable under good conditions since the discovery of
binarity. Aims: In this context, we have organized a large monitoring campaign
to refine the orbital solution and to study the wind-wind collision. Methods:
This paper presents the analysis of optical spectroscopic data, as well as of a
dedicated X-ray monitoring performed with Swift and XMM. Results: In light of
our refined orbital solution, Cyg OB2 #9 appears as a massive O+O binary with a
long period and high eccentricity; its components (O5-5.5I for the primary and
O3-4III for the secondary) have similar masses and similar luminosities. The
new data also provide the first evidence that a wind-wind collision is present
in the system. In the optical domain, the broad Ha line varies, displaying
enhanced absorption and emission components at periastron. X-ray observations
yield the unambiguous signature of an adiabatic collision because, as the stars
approach periastron, the X-ray luminosity closely follows the 1/D variation
expected in that case. The X-ray spectrum appears, however, slightly softer at
periastron, which is probably related to winds colliding at slightly lower
speeds at that time. Conclusions: It is the first time that such a variation
has been detected in O+O systems, and the first case where the wind-wind
collision is found to remain adiabatic even at periastron passage.

involves three standing-wave (sw) pulses. With this technique, a perturbing sw
pulse is used to shift the phase of excited momentum states---producing a

narrow fringes that revive periodically at twice the two-photon recoil
frequency, $2\omega_q$, as a function of the onset time of the pulse.
Experiments are performed using samples of laser-cooled rubidium atoms with

measurement of $\omega_q$ with a statistical uncertainty of 37 parts per $10^9$

improvements are anticipated by extending this time scale and narrowing the

first developed and applied to a large population of epilepsy patients (168)
and healthy controls (136). It was found that the most significant links
associated with epilepsy are those bilateral links with regions mainly
belonging to the default mode network and subcortex, such as amygdala, fusiform
gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus, hippocampus, temporal pole, parahippocampal
gyrus, insula, middle occipital gyrus, cuneus. These links were found to have
much higher odd ratios than other links, and all of them showed reduced
functional couplings in patients compared with controls. Interestingly, with
the increasing of the seizure onset frequency or duration of illness, the
functional connection between these bilateral regions became further reduced.
On the other hand, as a functional compensation and brain plasticity,
connections of these bilateral regions to other brain regions were abnormally
enhanced and became even much stronger with the increase of the seizure onset
frequency. Furthermore, patients had higher network efficiencies than healthy
controls, and the seizure onset frequency was found to be positively correlated
with the network efficiency. A negative correlation between the bilateral
connection and the network efficiency was also observed. To further validate
our findings, we then employed our BWAS results in discriminating patients from
healthy controls and the leave-one-out accuracy was around 78%. Given the fact
that a genome-wide association study with a large cohort has failed to identify
any significant association between genes and epilepsy, our study could provide
us with a set of endophenotypes for further study.

models in terms of Dobrushin ergodic coefficients of the reference Markov
transitions and the oscillations of the potential functions. Sufficient
conditions for uniform concentration inequalities w.r.t. time are expressed
explicitly in terms of these two quantities. We provide an original
perturbation analysis that applies to annealed and adaptive Feynman-Kac models,
yielding what seems to be the first results of this kind for these types of
models. Special attention is devoted to the particular case of Boltzmann-Gibbs
measures' sampling. In this context, we design an explicit way of tuning the
number of Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations with temperature schedule. We
also design an alternative interacting particle method based on an adaptive
strategy to define the temperature increments. The theoretical analysis of the
performance of this adaptive model is much more involved as both the potential
functions and the reference Markov transitions now depend on the random
evolution on the particle model. The nonasymptotic analysis of these complex
adaptive models is an open research problem. We initiate this study with the
concentration analysis of a simplified adaptive models based on reference
Markov transitions that coincide with the limiting quantities, as the number of
particles tends to infinity.

places various established results in number theory, infinitesimal calculus,
summability theory, asymptotic analysis, information theory, and the calculus
of finite differences under a single simple umbrella. Using Summability
Calculus, any given finite sum of the form $f(n) = \sum_{k=a}^n s_k\, g(k,n)$,
where $s_k$ is an arbitrary periodic sequence, becomes immediately \emph{in
analytic form}. Not only can we differentiate and integrate with respect to the
bound $n$ without having to rely on an explicit analytic formula for the finite
sum, but we can also deduce asymptotic expansions, accelerate convergence,
assign natural values to divergent sums, and evaluate the finite sum for any
$n\in\mathbb{C}$. This follows because the discrete definition of the simple
finite sum $f(n) = \sum_{k=a}^n s_k\, g(k,n)$ embodies a \emph{unique natural}
definition for all $n\in\mathbb{C}$. Throughout the paper, many established
results are strengthened such as the Bohr-Mollerup theorem, Stirling's
approximation, Glaisher's approximation, and the Shannon-Nyquist sampling
theorem. In addition, many celebrated theorems are extended and generalized
such as the Euler-Maclaurin summation formula and Boole's summation formula.
Finally, we show that countless identities that have been proved throughout the
past 300 years by different mathematicians using different approaches can
actually be derived in an elementary straightforward manner using the rules of
Summability Calculus.

  dynamics simulations","6 pages, 3 figures",,"10.1063/1.4769301",,"physics.comp-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Molecular dynamics algorithms are subject to some amount of error dependent
on the size of the time step that is used. This error can be corrected by
periodically updating the system with a Metropolis criteria, where the
integration step is treated as a selection probability for candidate state
generation. Such a method, closely related to generalized hybrid Monte Carlo
(GHMC), satisfies the balance condition by imposing a reversal of momenta upon
candidate rejection. In the present study, we demonstrate that such momentum
reversals can have a significant impact on molecular kinetics and extend the
time required for system decorrelation, resulting in an order of magnitude
increase in the integrated autocorrelation times of molecular variables for the
worst cases. We present a simple method, referred to as reduced-flipping GHMC,
that uses the information of the previous, current, and candidate states to
reduce the probability of momentum flipping following candidate rejection while
rigorously satisfying the balance condition. This method is a simple
modification to traditional, automatic-flipping, GHMC methods and significantly
mitigates the impact of such algorithms on molecular kinetics and simulation
mixing times.

level by formulating a stochastic cellular automata model with explicit rules
for pedestrians moving in two opposite directions. Coarse-grained mesoscopic
and macroscopic analogs are derived leading to the coupled system of PDEs for
the density of the pedestrian traffic. The obtained PDE system is of a mixed
hyperbolic-elliptic type and therefore, we rigorously derive higher-order
nonlinear diffusive corrections for the macroscopic PDE model. We perform
numerical experiments, which compare and contrast the behavior of the
microscopic stochastic model and the resulting coarse-grained PDEs for various
parameter settings and initial conditions. We also demonstrate that the
nonlinear diffusion is essential for reproducing the behavior of the stochastic
system in the nonhyperbolic regime.
