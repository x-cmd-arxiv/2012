the edge of a two-dimensional topological insulator, acts as a source of
spin-pumping for a magnetic impurity with uniaxial anisotropy. One can then
manipulate the impurity spin direction by means of an electrical current
without using either magnetic electrodes or an external magnetic field.
Furthermore we show that the unique properties of the quantum spin Hall
topological state have profound effects on the inelastic electron tunneling
spectrum of the impurity. For low current densities inelastic spin-flip events
do not contribute to the conductance. As a consequence the conductance steps,
normally appearing at voltages corresponding to the spin excitations, are
completely suppressed. In contrast an intense current leads to spin pumping and
generates a transverse component of the impurity spin. This breaks the
topological phase yielding to the conductance steps.

the possibility of temporary captures in spin-orbit resonances. The results of
the numerical simulations of the exact equations of motions indicate that,
whenever the planet rotation is trapped in a resonant motion, the orbital decay
and the eccentricity damping are faster than the ones in which the rotation
follows the so-called pseudo-synchronization. Analytical results obtained
through the averaged equations of the spin-orbit problem show a good agreement
with the numerical simulations. We apply the analysis to the cases of the
recently discovered hot super-Earths Kepler-10 b, GJ 3634 b and 55 Cnc e. The
simulated dynamical history of these systems indicates the possibility of
capture in several spin-orbit resonances; particularly, GJ 3634 b and 55 Cnc e
can currently evolve under a non-synchronous resonant motion for suitable
values of the parameters. Moreover, 55 Cnc e may avoid a chaotic rotation
behavior by evolving towards synchronization through successive temporary

  September 2012",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ""regular"" model presented here can be considered to be the most natural
solution to the problem of constructing the simplest possible relativistic
analogue of the category of classical Fourier--Euler thermally conducting fluid
models as characterised by a pair of equations of state for just two dependent
variables (an equilibrium density and a conducting scalar). The historically
established but causally unsatisfactory solution to this problem due to Eckart
is shown to be based on an ansatz that is interpretable as postulating a most
unnatural relation between the (particle and entropy) velocities and their
associated momenta, which accounts for the well known bad behaviour of that
model which has recently been shown to have very pathological
mixed-elliptic-hyperbolic comportments. The newer (and more elegant) solution
of Landau and Lifshitz has a more mathematically respectable
parabolic-hyperbolic comportment, but is still compatible with a well posed
initial value problem only in such a restricted limit-case such as that of
linearised perturbations of a static background. For mathematically acceptable
behaviour undermore general circumstances, and a fortiori for the physically
motivated requirement of subluminal signal propagation, only strictly
hyperbolic behaviour is acceptable. Attention is drawn here to the availability
of a more modern ""regular"" solution which, is fully satisfactory as far as all
these requirements are concerned. This ""regular"" category of relativistic
conducting fluid models arises naturally within a recently developed
variational approach, in which the traditionally important
stress--momentum-energy density tensor is relegated to a secondary role, while
the relevant covariant 4-momentum co-vectors are instead brought to the fore.

to understand these phases we performed a comparative study of 21 young stellar

and fundamental parameters based on surface stellar density maps, radial
density profile, and colour-magnitude diagrams. We obtained age and mass
distributions by comparing pre-main sequence models with the position of
cluster members in the colour-magnitude diagram. The mean age of our sample is
~ 5 Myr, where 57% of the objects is found in the 4 - 10 Myr range of age,
while 43% is < 4 Myr old. Their low E(B-V) indicate that the members are not
suffering high extinction Av < 1 mag), which means they are more likely young
stellar groups than embedded clusters. Relations between structural and
fundamental parameters were used to verify differences and similarities that
could be found among the clusters. The parameters of most of the objects have
the same trends or correlations. Comparisons with other young clusters show
similar relations among mass, radius and density. Our sample tends to have
larger radius and lower volumetric density, when compared to embedded clusters.
These differences are compatible with the mean age of our sample, which we
consider intermediary between the embedded and the exposed phases of the

attributed to the magnetic energy release in a highly magnetized region within
the nebula. I argue that such a region naturally arises in the polar region of
the inner nebula. In pulsar winds, efficient dissipation of the Poynting flux
into the plasma energy occur only in the equatorial belt where the energy is
predominantly transferred by alternating fields. At high latitudes, the pulsar
wind remains highly magnetized therefore the termination shock in the polar
region is weak and the postshock flow remains relativistic. I study the
structure of this flow and show that the flow at first expands and decelerates
and then it converges and accelerates. In the converging part of the flow, the
kink instability triggers the magnetic dissipation. The energy release zone
occurs at the base of the observed jet. A specific turbulence of
relativistically shrinking magnetic loops efficiently accelerates particles so
that the synchrotron emission in the hundreds MeV band, both persistent and
flaring, comes from this site.

(LIR/Lsun) = 11.14-12.57 from the flux-limited Great Observatories All-sky LIRG

nuLnu(V) increases from ~2-30 with increasing LIR. When normalized at
IRAS-60um, the largest range in the luminosity ratio,
R(lambda)=log[nuLnu(lambda)/nuLnu(60um)] observed over the full sample is seen
in the Hard X-rays (HX=2-10 keV). A small range is found in the Radio (1.4GHz),

dust temperatures, and dust masses were computed from fitting thermal dust
emission modified blackbodies to the mid-infrared (MIR) through submillimeter
SEDs. The new results reflect an overall ~0.02 dex lower luminosity than the
original IRAS values. Total stellar masses were computed by fitting stellar
population synthesis models to the observed near-infrared (NIR) through
ultraviolet (UV) SEDs. Mean stellar masses are found to be log(M/Msun) =
10.79+/-0.40. Star formation rates have been determined from the infrared

(SFR_UV~1.3Msun/yr), respectively. Multiwavelength AGN indicators have be used
to select putative AGN: about 60% of the ULIRGs would have been classified as
an AGN by at least one of the selection criteria.

They govern these bodies' tidal despinning, and also participate in the subtle
process of entrapment of these bodies into spin-orbit resonances. This makes
tidal torques directly relevant to the studies of habitability of planets and
their moons.
  Our work begins with an explanation of how friction and lagging should be
built into the theory of bodily tides. Although much of this material can be
found in various publications, a short but self-consistent summary on the topic
has been lacking in the hitherto literature, and we are filling the gap.
  After these preparations, we address a popular concise formula for the tidal
torque, which is often used in the literature, for planets or stars.We explain
why the derivation of this expression, offered in the paper by Goldreich (1966;
AJ 71, 1 - 7) and in the books by Kaula (1968, eqn. 4.5.29), and Murray &
Dermott (1999, eqn. 4.159), implicitly sets the time lag to be frequency
independent. Accordingly, the ensuing expression for the torque can be applied
only to bodies having a very special (and very hypothetical) rheology which
makes the time lag frequency independent, i.e, the same for all Fourier modes
in the spectrum of tide. This expression for the torque should not be used for
bodies of other rheologies. Specifically, the expression cannot be combined
with an extra assertion of the geometric lag (or the phase lag) being constant,
because at finite eccentricities the said assumption is incompatible with the
constant-time-lag condition.

eccentric orbit can, outside a spin-orbit resonance, be captured in a
quasi-static tidal equilibrium called pseudosynchronous rotation. The existence
of such configurations was deduced from oversimplified tidal models assuming
either a constant tidal torque or a torque linear in the tidal frequency. A
more accurate treatment requires that the torque be decomposed into the
Darwin-Kaula series over the tidal modes, and that this decomposition be
combined with a realistic choice of rheological properties of the mantle. This
development demonstrates that there exist no stable equilibrium states for
solid planets and moons, other than spin-orbit resonances.

distances prevents nucleons from becoming close to each other. This gives rise
to high-momentum nucleons in the nucleus that cannot be explained in the
context of the mean field and are commonly called short-range correlations
(SRCs). They are responsible for the strength seen in momentum distribution
tails seen in all nuclei, and we can obtain a relative measure of SRCs via
cross section ratios to light nuclei. Recent inclusive scattering data from
Jefferson Lab have allowed a precise determination of the A-dependence of SRCs
in nuclei and suggests that, like the EMC effect, it is especially sensitive to
the nuclear local density. These new results, as well as a new analysis of the
relationship between SRCs and the EMC effect, will be presented and discussed.

B1822-09,taken by the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope. B1822-09 has been known
to exhibit two stable emission modes, the B-mode, where the precursor (PC)
`turns-on', and the Q-mode, which is defined by interpulse (IP) emission. The
results of our analysis, of this extremely long observation, have shown that
B1822-09 exhibits at least three other emission behaviors that have not been
seen before in other similar pulsars or in other observations of B1822-09.
These three behaviors can be described as: Q-mode emission with PC emission,
B-mode emission with IP emission, and instances where both the PC and IP are
`on' when transitioning from one mode to the other. The pulse structure has
been found to be more complex than previously thought. The MP has an inner
cone/core triple (T) configuration together with a central sightline traverse.
The IP is a 15/degr-wide region, that along with the MP originate from an open
dipolar field. The PC emission comes from a still unknown source. We argue that
the PC emission arises within the same region as the MP, but likely comes from
higher in the magnetosphere. Overall, our analyses strongly suggest that mode
changes allow information transfer between the two magnetic polar regions and
contribute to global magnetospheric changes.

moment terms affects the evaluation of the mode function and in turn the
bispectrum, and show explicitly that the mode function takes various asymptotic

short-hard gamma-ray burst (SGRB). Our earlier study of magnetized BHNSs showed
that NS tidal disruption winds the magnetic field into a toroidal
configuration, with poloidal fields so weak that capturing MRI with full-disk
simulations would require $\sim 10^8$ CPU-hours. In that study we imposed
equatorial symmetry, suppressing poloidal magnetic fields that might be
generated from plasma crossing the orbital plane. Here we show that initial
conditions that break this symmetry (i.e., {\it tilted} poloidal magnetic
fields in the NS) generate much stronger poloidal fields in the disk,
indicating that asymmetric initial conditions may be necessary for establishing
BHNS mergers as SGRB progenitors via fully general relativistic MHD
simulations. We demonstrate that BHNS mergers may form an SGRB engine under the
right conditions by seeding the remnant disk from an unmagnetized BHNS
simulation with purely poloidal fields dynamically unimportant initially, but
strong enough to resolve MRI. Magnetic turbulence occurs in the disk, driving
accretion and supporting Poynting-dominated jet outflows sufficient to power an
SGRB.

redshifts: a systemic redshift of z ~ 0.714 based on narrow emission lines, a
broad MgII emission line centered 1200 km/s bluer than the systemic velocity,
at z ~ 0.707, and broad H\alpha and H\beta emission lines centered at z ~

well-established, however there is still some disagreement with respect to its
exact shape and its possible dependence on other observables. Aims: We measure
the MMR in the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. We compare our measured
MMR to that measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and study the
dependence of the MMR on various selection criteria to identify potential
causes for disparities seen in the literature. Methods: We use strong emission
line ratio diagnostics to derive oxygen abundances. We then apply a range of
selection criteria for the minimum signal-to-noise in various emission lines,
as well as the apparent and absolute magnitude to study variations in the
inferred MMR. Results: The shape and position of the MMR can differ
significantly depending on the metallicity calibration and selection used.
After selecting a robust metallicity calibration amongst those tested, we find
that the mass-metallicity relation for redshifts 0.061< z<0.35 in GAMA is in
reasonable agreement with that found in the SDSS despite the difference in the
luminosity range probed. Conclusions: In view of the significant variations of
the MMR brought about by reasonable changes in the sample selection criteria
and method, we recommend that care be taken when comparing the MMR from
different surveys and studies directly. We also conclude that there could be a
modest level of evolution over 0.06<z<0.35 within the GAMA sample.

pressure equilibrium with the background. Our suite of simulations explores the
following parameters: the equation of state, radial profiles of the background
gas, and start times for the evolution. Our primary focus is on how the fate of
this cloud will affect the future activity of Sgr A*. From our simulations we
expect an average feeding rate in the range of $5-19 \times 10^{-8}$ solar
masses per year beginning in 2013 and lasting for at least 7 years (our
simulations stop in year 2020). The accretion varies by less than a factor of
three on timescales <1 month, and shows no more than a factor of 10 difference
between the maximum and minimum. These rates are comparable to the current
estimated accretion rate in the immediate vicinity of Sgr A*, although they
represent only a small (<5%) increase over the current expected feeding rate at
the effective inner boundary of our simulations. Therefore, the break up of
cloud G2 may have only a minimal effect on the brightness and variability of
Sgr A* over the next decade. This is because current models of the galactic
center predict that most of the gas will be caught up in outflows. However, if
the accreted G2 material can remain cold, it may not mix well with the hot,
diffuse background gas, and instead accrete efficiently onto Sgr A*. Further
observations of G2 will give us an unprecedented opportunity to test this idea.
The break up of the cloud itself may also be observable. By tracking the amount
of cloud energy that is dissipated during our simulations, we are able to get a
rough estimate of the luminosity associated with its tidal disruption; we find
values of a few $10^{36}$ erg/s.

the host galaxy properties of a large sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
obtained by combining X-ray and optical spectroscopic selections. Based on a
careful study of their Spectral Energy Distribution (SED), which has been
parametrized using a 2-component (AGN+galaxy) model fit, we derived
dust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colors, stellar masses and star formation
rates (SFRs). We find that AGN hosts span a large range of stellar masses and
SFRs. No color-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the AGN hosts, which are
found to be mainly massive, red galaxies. Once accounting for the color-mass
degeneracy in well defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual marginal
enhancement of AGN incidence in redder galaxies with lower specific star
formation rates, and we argue that this result might emerge because of our
ability to properly account for AGN light contamination and dust extinction.
Interestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black hole
growing at any given ""specific accretion rate"" (i.e. the ratio of X-ray
luminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxy
mass, while it decreases as a power-law with Lx/M. By analyzing the
normalization of such probability distribution, we show how the incidence of
AGN increases with redshift as rapidly as (1+z)^4, in close resemblance with
the overall evolution of the specific star formation rate of the entire galaxy
population. Although AGN activity and star formation in galaxies do appear to
have a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within the
COSMOS sample we do not find strong evidence of any 'smoking gun' signaling
powerful AGN influence on the star-forming properties of their hosts galaxies.

surrounding A0 star Oph IRS 48 in the nearby Rho Ophiuchus region has a 30 AU

CO in the 5 micron fundamental ro-vibrational band. We present here
Submillimeter Array 880 micron continuum imaging resolving an inner hole.
However, the radius of the hole in the millimeter dust is only 13 AU,
significantly smaller than measured at other wavelengths. The nesting structure
of the disk is counter-intuitive, with increasingly large radii rings of
emission seen in the millimeter dust (12.9 +1.7/-3.4 AU), 5 micron CO (30 AU)

this structure, including self-shadowing that cools the disk surface layers,
photodissociation of CO, and photoevaporation. However, understanding this
unusual disk within the stringent multi-wavelength spatial constraints will
require further observations to search for cold atomic and molecular gas.

without major inconsistencies in the reported properties. For
alkali-intercalated iron selenides, even the structure of the superconducting
phase is a subject of debate, in part because the onset of superconductivity is
affected much more delicately by stoichiometry and preparation than in cuprate
or pnictide superconductors. If high-quality, pure, superconducting
intercalated iron selenides are ever to be made, the intertwined physics and
chemistry must be explained by systematic studies of how these materials form
and by and identifying the many coexisting phases. To that end, we prepared
pure K_2Fe_4Se_5 powder and superconductors in the K_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 system, and
examined differences in their structures by high-resolution synchrotron and
single-crystal x-ray diffraction. We found four distinct phases: semiconducting
K_2Fe_4Se_5, a metallic superconducting phase K_xFe_2Se_2 with x ranging from
0.38 to 0.58, an insulator KFe_{1.6}Se_2 with no vacancy ordering, and an
oxidized phase K_{0.51(5)}Fe_{0.70(2)}Se that forms the PbClF structure upon
exposure to moisture. We find that the vacancy-ordered phase K_2Fe_4Se_5 does
not become superconducting by doping, but the distinct iron-rich minority phase
K_xFe_2Se_2 precipitates from single crystals upon cooling from above the
vacancy ordering temperature. This coexistence of metallic and semiconducting
phases explains a broad maximum in resistivity around 100 K. Further studies to
understand the solubility of excess Fe in the K_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 structure will
shed light on the maximum fraction of superconducting K_xFe_2Se_2 that can be

separate charge exchange contributions originating within the heliosphere from

below 1 keV was reduced by about a factor of four from contamination that

the centroid expected for thermal emission is 568.4 eV while for charge
exchange is 564.2 eV, thermal emission appears to dominate for this line
complex, consistent with much of the high-latitude O VII emission originating

[Suslin-Friedlander-Bendel, J. Amer. Math. Soc, \textbf{10} (1997), 693--728].
In this paper, we study both geometric and algebraic properties including
irreducibility, singularity, normality and Cohen-Macaulayness of the commuting
varieties $C_r(\mathfrak{gl}_2), C_r(\fraksl_2)$ and $C_r(\N)$ where $\N$ is
the nilpotent cone of $\fraksl_2$. Our calculations lead us to state a
conjecture on Cohen-Macaulayness for commuting varieties of $r$-tuples.
Furthermore, in the case when $\g=\fraksl_2$, we obtain interesting results
about commuting varieties when adding more restrictions into each tuple. In the
case of $\fraksl_3$, we are able to verify the aforementioned properties for
$C_r(\fraku)$. Finally, applying our calculations on the commuting variety
$C_r(\overline{\calO_{\sub}})$ where $\overline{\calO_{\sub}}$ is the closure
of the subregular orbit in $\fraksl_3$, we prove that the nilpotent commuting
variety $C_r(\N)$ has singularities of codimension $\ge 2$.

helicity are coupled together and can be converted from one into the other
while the total gauge-invariant relative canonical helicity remains globally
invariant. The conversion is driven by enthalpy differences at a surface common

why the threshold for bifurcation in counter-helicity merging depends on the

annihilation channels enthalpy into the magnetic flux tube or into the

maps at 1600 A and 1700 A, which can be used for helioseismic studies at
different heights in the solar photosphere. We perform a Hankel-Fourier
analysis in an annulus centered around sunspots or quiet-Sun regions, to
estimate the change in power of waves crossing these regions of interest. We
find that there is a dependence of power-reduction coefficients on measurement
height in the photosphere: Sunspots reduce the power of outgoing waves with
frequencies lower than 4.5 mHz at all heights, but enhance the power of
acoustic waves in the range 4.5-5.5 mHz toward chromospheric heights, which is
likely the signature of acoustic glories (halos). Maximum power reduction seems
to occur near the continuum level and to decrease with altitude. Sunspots also
impact the frequencies of outgoing waves in an altitude-dependent fashion. The
quiet Sun is shown to behave like a strong power reducer for outgoing f and
p-modes at the continuum level, with a power reduction 15-20%, and like a weak
power enhancer for p-modes higher in the atmosphere. It is speculated that the
surprising power reduction at the continuum level is related to granulation. In
Doppler-velocity data, and unlike in intensity data, the quiet Sun behaves like
a strong power reducer for granular flows.

water adjacent to the ordered adlayers forms a soft, liquid-vapor-like
interface with concomitant manifestations of hydrophobicity. Temporal defects
in the adlayer configurations create a dynamic heterogeneity in the degree to
which different regions of the interface attract hydrophobic species. The
structure and heterogeneous dynamics of the adlayer defects depend upon the
geometry of the underlying ordered metal surface. For both 100 and 111

unknown. The gas of these high latitude molecular clouds (hereafter referred to
as halo clouds) is located in a region where the gas in the disk may interact
with the gas in the halo in the Galactic center region.
  Aims: To derive Tkin in the molecular clouds at high latitude and understand
the physical process responsible for the heating of the molecular gas both in
the Central Molecular Zone (the concentration of molecular gas in the inner 500
pc) and in the giant molecular loops.
  Methods: We measured the metastable inversion transitions of NH3 from (1,1)
to (6,6) toward six positions selected throughout the Galactic central disk and
halo. We used rotational diagrams and large velocity gradient modeling to
estimate the kinetic temperatures toward all the sources. We also observed
other molecules like SiO, HNCO, CS, C34S, C18O, and 13CO, to derive the
densities and to trace different physical processes (shocks, photodissociation,
dense gas) expected to dominate the heating of the molecular gas.
  Results: We derive for the first time Tkin of the high latitude clouds
interacting with the disk in the Galactic center region. We find high
rotational temperatures in all the observed positions. We derive two kinetic
temperature components (150 K and 40 K) for the positions in the Central
Molecular Zone, and only the warm kinetic temperature component for the clouds
toward the giant molecular loops. The fractional abundances derived from the
different molecules suggest that shocks provide the main heating mechanism

  by Incorporating Plasmonic Contact Electrodes",,,"10.1038/ncomms2638",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Even though the terahertz spectrum is well suited for chemical
identification, material characterization, biological sensing and medical
imaging, practical development of these applications has been hindered by the
attributes of terahertz sources, namely low output power and poor efficiency.
Here, we demonstrate that use of plasmonic contact electrodes can significantly
enhance the optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiency in a photoconductive
terahertz emitter. The use of plasmonic contact electrodes offers nanoscale
carrier transport path lengths for the photocarriers, enabling efficient
collection of the majority of carriers in a sub-picosecond time-scale. It also
allows increasing photoconductor active area without a considerable increase in
the capacitive loading to the antenna, boosting the maximum terahertz radiation
power by preventing the carrier screening effect and thermal breakdown at high
optical pump powers. We experimentally demonstrated 50 times higher terahertz
radiation power from a plasmonic photoconductive emitter in comparison with a
similar photoconductive emitter with non-plasmonic contact electrodes.

experiences a quantum Brayton cycle in one quantum Brayton cycle (characterized

cycle (characterized by $F_y$). The efficiency for the composite system equals
to that for the subsystem in both cases, but the work done by the total system

over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it
ranking of online gamers (e.g. MSR's TrueSkill system) and chess players,
aggregating social opinions, or deciding which product to sell based on
transactions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding
`scores' for each object (e.g. player's rating) is of interest for
understanding the intensity of the preferences.
  In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation
algorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pair-wise
comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the
graph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are
compared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to
be its stationary probability under this random walk. To study the efficacy of
the algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model
(equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pair-wise comparisons) in which
each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes
of pair-wise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pair-wise marginal
probabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the
BTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the
scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. In
particular, the number of samples required to learn the score well with high
probability depends on the structure of the comparison graph. When the
Laplacian of the comparison graph has a strictly positive spectral gap, e.g.
each item is compared to a subset of randomly chosen items, this leads to
dependence on the number of samples that is nearly order-optimal.

sharing as special cases. Based on the information commonly known to all the
controllers, the decentralized problem is reformulated as an equivalent
centralized problem from the perspective of a coordinator. The coordinator
knows the common information and select prescriptions that map each
controller's local information to its control actions. The optimal control
problem at the coordinator is shown to be a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP) which is solved using techniques from Markov decision
theory. This approach provides (a) structural results for optimal strategies,
and (b) a dynamic program for obtaining optimal strategies for all controllers
in the original decentralized problem. Thus, this approach unifies the various
ad-hoc approaches taken in the literature. In addition, the structural results
on optimal control strategies obtained by the proposed approach cannot be
obtained by the existing generic approach (the person-by-person approach) for
obtaining structural results in decentralized problems; and the dynamic program
obtained by the proposed approach is simpler than that obtained by the existing
generic approach (the designer's approach) for obtaining dynamic programs in
decentralized problems.

bidders and any number of identical items. All prior results on such auctions
consider only two items. We construct a canonical outcome of the auction that
is the only natural equilibrium and is unique under a refinement of subgame
perfect equilibria. We show certain interesting properties of this equilibrium;
for instance, we show that the prices decrease as the auction progresses. This
phenomenon has been observed in many experiments and previous theoretic work
attributed it to features such as uncertainty in the supply or risk averse
bidders. We show that such features are not needed for this phenomenon and that
it arises purely from the most essential features: budget constraints and the
sequential nature of the auction. A little surprisingly we also show that in
this equilibrium one agent wins all his items in the beginning and then the
other agent wins the rest. The major difficulty in analyzing such sequential
auctions has been in understanding how the selling prices of the first few
rounds affect the utilities of the agents in the later rounds. We tackle this
difficulty by identifying certain key properties of the auction and the proof
is via a joint induction on all of them.

generate extra, disconnected contributions to the bispectrum. We also discuss
uniqueness of the action with respect to conformal frames. When expressed in
terms of the gauge invariant curvature perturbation on uniform field
hypersurfaces the action for cosmological perturbations has a unique form,
independent of the original Einstein or Jordan frame. Crucial is that the gauge
invariant comoving curvature perturbation is frame independent, which makes it
extremely helpful in showing the quantum equivalence of the two frames, and
therefore in calculating quantum effects in nonminimally coupled theories such
as Higss inflation.

analysis at the level of the whole economy. In practice, general equilibrium
treats economies as being always in equilibrium, albeit in a sequence of
equilibria as driven by external changes in parameters. This view is sometimes
defended on the grounds that internal dynamics are fast, while external changes
are slow, so that the economy can be viewed as adjusting instantaneously to any
changed conditions. However, the argument has not been presented in a rigorous
way. In this paper we show that when conditions are such that: a) economies do
respond essentially instantaneously to external influences; b) the external
changes are small compared to the values that characterize the economy; and c)
the economy's dynamics are continuous and first-order in time (as for Walrasian
tatonnement), the resulting economic theory is equivalent to a topological
field theory. Because it is a topological theory it has no dynamics in a strict
sense, and so perturbatively---that is, when examining dynamics in the region
of a critical point---the field theory behaves as general equilibrium posits.
However, the field-theoretic form of the theory admits non-perturbative
instanton solutions that link different critical points. Thus, in this theory,
and in contrast to general equilibrium, the internal dynamics of the model
occasionally make an appearance in the form of abrupt, noise-driven transitions
between critical points.

intense burst activity. A follow-up Suzaku observation on January 28 recorded
enhanced persistent emission both in soft and hard X-rays (Enoto et al. 2010b).
Through re-analysis of the same Suzaku data, 18 short bursts were identified in
the X-ray events recorded by the Hard X-ray Detector (HXD) and the X-ray
Imaging Spectrometer (XIS). Their spectral peaks appear in the HXD-PIN band,
and their 10-70 keV X-ray fluences range from ~2e-9 erg cm-2 to 1e-7 erg cm-2.
Thus, the 18 events define a significantly weaker burst sample than was ever
obtained, ~1e-8-1e-4 erg cm-2. In the ~0.8 to ~300 keV band, the spectra of the
three brightest bursts can be represented successfully by a two-blackbody
model, or a few alternative ones. A spectrum constructed by stacking 13 weaker
short bursts with fluences in the range (0.2-2)e-8 erg s-1 is less curved, and
its ratio to the persistent emission spectrum becomes constant at ~170 above ~8
keV. As a result, the two-blackbody model was able to reproduce the stacked
weaker-burst spectrum only after adding a power-law model, of which the photon
index is fixed at 1.54 as measured is the persistent spectrum. These results
imply a possibility that the spectrum composition employing an optically-thick
component and a hard power-law component can describe wide-band spectra of both
the persistent and weak-burst emissions, despite a difference of their fluxes
by two orders of magnitude. Based on the spectral similarity, a possible
connection between the unresolved short bursts and the persistent emission is
discussed.

over the orbital angular momentum (while the spin of the smaller companion can
be neglected). They emerge as a double expansion in the post-Newtonian
parameter $\varepsilon$ and the ratio $\xi $ of the orbital angular momentum
and dominant spin. The SDW amplitudes are presented to
($\varepsilon^{3/2},\xi$) orders, while the phase of the gravitational waves to
($\varepsilon^{2},\xi$) orders (omitting the highest order mixed terms). To
this accuracy the amplitude includes the (leading order) spin-orbit
contributions, while the phase the (leading order) spin-orbit, self-spin and
mass quadrupole-monopole contributions. While the SDW hold for any mass ratio
smaller than 1:30, lower bounds for the mass ratios are derived from the best
sensitivity frequency range expected for Advanced LIGO (giving 1:140), the
Einstein Telescope ($7\times 10^{-4}$), the LAGRANGE ($7\times 10^{-7}$) and
LISA missions ($7\times 10^{-9}$), respectively.

superconductors is shown to be a key term for control of the superconductivity
critical temperature. All high temperature superconductors show anisotropic
gaps and/or multi-gap superconductivity in the clean limit. They show the shape
resonance in superconducting gaps that is a type of Fano resonance driven by
the Josephson-like term for pairs transfer. These resonances occur where one of
the multiple Fermi surface spots is near a 2.5 Lifshitz transition. The Fano
antiresonance occurs between a BCS condensate and a BEC-like condensate. In a
system near a 2.5 Lifshitz transition the lattice is close to an instability.
This drives to the formation of a granular superconducting phase made of a
charge density metal formed by puddles of ordered oxygen interstitials or
ordered local lattice distortions (static short range charge density waves)
detected by scanning nano-x-ray diffraction imaging. We show that the scale
free networks of superconducting grains tuned to a Fano resonance is an
essential feature of high temperature superconductors that favours high Tc.

surface plasmon polaritons confined in single-mode waveguide resonators. Based
on the Green's function approach, we develop the conditions for the weak and
strong coupling regimes by taking into account the sources of dissipation and
decoherence: radiative and non-radiative decays, internal loss processes in the
emitter, as well as propagation and leakage losses of the plasmons in the
resonator. The theory is supported by numerical calculations for several
quantum emitters, GaAs and CdSe quantum dots and NV centers together with
different types of resonators constructed of hybrid, cylindrical or wedge
waveguides. We further study the role of temperature and resonator length.
Assuming realistic leakage rates, we find the existence of an optimal length at
which strong coupling is possible. Our calculations show that the strong
coupling regime in plasmonic resonators is accessible within current technology
when working at very low temperatures (<4K). In the weak coupling regime our
theory accounts for recent experimental results. By further optimization we
find highly enhanced spontaneous emission with Purcell factors over 1000 at
room temperature for NV-centers. We finally discuss more applications for
quantum nonlinear optics and plasmon-plasmon interactions.

puzzling since its discovery due to lack of compelling theories for sustainable
hot diffuse X-ray emission in the Galactic plane. Recently (Revnivtsev et al.
2009; R09) claimed that about 90% of the 6.5-7.1 keV X-ray flux from a small
section of a low extinction region at 1.4 degree south of the Galactic Center
has been resolved to discrete sources with 2-10 keV L_X > 4x10^{-16} erg s
cm^-2, using ultra-deep (1 Ms) Chandra ACIS-I observations. They also concluded
thatcoronally active stars such as active binaries (ABs) contribute about 60%
of the resolved flux. However, our recent discovery of a large population of
magnetic cataclysmic variables (MCVs) in the same region suggests their
significant role in the resolved hard X-ray flux. In addition, deep X-ray
surveys of other several Galactic Bulge fields over the past decade have
indicated that MCVs are likely the major contributor in the hard X-ray emission
above 2-3 keV. To solve this mystery, we have conducted an independent indepth
analysis of discrete X-ray sources in the low extinction region. The total
fraction of the 6.5-7.1 keV flux we can confidently claim as resolved is
70-80%, which largely agrees with R09 but leaves some room for diffuse
components. However, despite the various attempts, we consistently find that
the resolved hard X-ray flux above 3 keV is dominated by relatively bright,
hard X-ray sources such as MCVs, whereas the contribution from relatively
faint, soft sources such as ABs is below 20%. We describe in detail our
analysis procedure in order to elucidate possible origins of the discrepancy.

distributions are sub-Gaussian. In this paper we examine the bandit problem
under the weaker assumption that the distributions have moments of order
1+\epsilon, for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. Surprisingly, moments of order 2
(i.e., finite variance) are sufficient to obtain regret bounds of the same
order as under sub-Gaussian reward distributions. In order to achieve such
regret, we define sampling strategies based on refined estimators of the mean
such as the truncated empirical mean, Catoni's M-estimator, and the
median-of-means estimator. We also derive matching lower bounds that also show
that the best achievable regret deteriorates when \epsilon <1.
