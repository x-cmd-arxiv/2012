ejections (CMEs), which were subsequently tracked by the SECCHI suite onboard
STEREO. Using the COR2 coronagraphs and the heliospheric imagers (HIs), the
initial direction of both CMEs is determined to be slightly west of the
Sun-Earth line. We derive the CME kinematics, including the evolution of the
CME expansion until 0.4 AU. We find that, during the interaction, the second
CME decelerates from a speed above 500 km/s to 380 km/s the speed of the
leading edge of the first CME. STEREO observes a complex structure composed of
two different bright tracks in HI2-A but only one bright track in HI2-B. In
situ measurements from Wind show an ""isolated"" ICME, with the geometry of a
flux rope preceded by a shock. Measurements in the sheath are consistent with
draping around the transient. By combining remote-sensing and in situ
measurements, we determine that this event shows a clear instance of deflection
of two CMEs after their collision, and we estimate the deflection of the first
CME to be about 10 degrees towards the Sun-Earth line. The arrival time,
arrival speed and radius at Earth of the first CME are best predicted from
remote-sensing observations taken before the collision of the CMEs. Due to the
over-expansion of the CME after the collision, there are few, if any, signs of
interaction in in situ measurements. This study illustrates that complex
interactions during the Sun-to-Earth propagation may not be revealed by in situ
measurements alone.

nonlinear properties of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) by means of
three- dimensional simulations in the framework of a local shearing box
approximation. By changing systematically the shear rates that symbolize the
degree of differential rotation in nascent proto-neutron stars (PNSs), we
derive a scaling relation between the turbulent stress sustained by the MRI and
the shear- vorticity ratio. Our parametric survey shows a power-law scaling
between the turbulent stress ($<< w_{\rm tot}>>$) and the shear- vorticity
ratio ($g_q$) as $<<w_{\rm tot}>> \propto g_q^{\delta}$ with its index $\delta
\sim 0.5$. The MRI-amplified magnetic energy has a similar scaling relative to
the turbulent stress, while the Maxwell stress has slightly smaller power-law
index ($\sim 0.36$). By modeling the effect of viscous heating rates due to the
MRI turbulence, we show that the stronger magnetic fields or the larger shear
rates initially imposed lead to the higher dissipation rates. For a rapidly
rotating PNS with the spin period in milliseconds and with strong magnetic
fields of $10^{15}$ G, the energy dissipation rate is estimated to exceed
$10^{51} {\rm erg\ sec^{-1}}$. Our results suggest that the conventional
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mechanism of core-collapse supernovae is likely to be
affected by the MRI-driven turbulence, which we speculate, on one hand, could
harm the MHD-driven explosions due to the dissipation of the shear rotational
energy at the PNS surface, on the other hand the energy deposition there might
be potentially favorable for the working of the neutrino-heating mechanism.

reconstruction in the case where the observed scene is a collection of

dealing with independent spectral slices. This is achieved thanks to a
regularization which favors spatial sparsity and spectral grouping of the

a specialized optimization algorithm which also accounts for non-negativity of

molecular wings toward the other 31 sources in the survey indicating that
large-scale, distinct outflows are rare toward this sample of candidate
protostars. Several potential outflows are confused with kinematic structure in

discuss model selections within the existing uncertainties of stellar

produce packets in half duplex manner in no time, deterministic time, and non
deterministic time. Analysis of the model for above time options leads the
model in deadlock. The model can be out of the deadlock if timings in the model
is incorporated in alternative fashion. The generators produce packets after a
delay of 10 seconds. However, generator one has an initial shift of 5 seconds
after which it begins sending a packet every 10 seconds. Hence, initial delay
for generator one is 15 seconds and for generator two it is 10 seconds. Due to
this initial shift, both generators produce packets alternatively and is
deadlock free as the packets do not meet at the same time instant. Moreover,
the existing system model is not concurrent and hence takes more time for
packet transfer in every iteration. In this paper we have proposed a model of
buffer system using an additional dummy buffer for transfer of data packets, we
thus checking the model with various time models as no time, deterministic time
and non deterministic time. The results of proposed model under above time
models are in deadlock. We achieve deadlock free situation by introducing
appropriate delay in various buffers of the proposed system, the delay timing
is nondeterministic time. The new approach speeds up the transfer of packets,
as a result the transfer of data becomes concurrent, deadlock free and hence
the model proposed is time efficient. Simulation results shows that the
proposed two way buffer system is fully concurrent and time efficient as

continuous function f of several block variables. At each iteration of this
method, a single block of variables is optimized, while the remaining variables
are held fixed. To ensure the convergence of the BCD method, the subproblem to
be optimized in each iteration needs to be solved exactly to its unique optimal
solution. Unfortunately, these requirements are often too restrictive for many
practical scenarios. In this paper, we study an alternative inexact BCD
approach which updates the variable blocks by successively minimizing a
sequence of approximations of f which are either locally tight upper bounds of
f or strictly convex local approximations of f. We focus on characterizing the
convergence properties for a fairly wide class of such methods, especially for
the cases where the objective functions are either non-differentiable or
nonconvex. Our results unify and extend the existing convergence results for
many classical algorithms such as the BCD method, the difference of convex

transverse Ising model is found to undergo a second-order quantum phase
transition with a diverging magnetic susceptibility but a finite correlation
length which is upper-bounded by 1/ln(q-1) even at the transition point (q is

undergoes a first-order quantum phase transition at the isotropic point.
Furthermore, the simple update scheme is found to be related with the Bethe

algorithms and performance upper bounds. However, much less is known about the
inherent complexity of these problems, and there are few lower bounds in the
literature, especially for nonlinear functions. In this paper, we investigate
the attainable error/regret in the bandit and derivative-free settings, as a
function of the dimension d and the available number of queries T. We provide a
precise characterization of the attainable performance for strongly-convex and
smooth functions, which also imply a non-trivial lower bound for more general
problems. Moreover, we prove that in both the bandit and derivative-free
setting, the required number of queries must scale at least quadratically with
the dimension. Finally, we show that on the natural class of quadratic
functions, it is possible to obtain a ""fast"" O(1/T) error rate in terms of T,
under mild assumptions, even without having access to gradients. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first such rate in a derivative-free stochastic
setting, and holds despite previous results which seem to imply the contrary.

creation is considered here. The energy spectra of created particles are
compared with the corresponding spectra obtained using the modulated plane wave

short pulse durations, this agreement breaks down. The sensitivity of pair
production to the polarization of a driving pulse is also investigated. We show
that in the nonperturbative regime, the pair creation yields depend on the
polarization of the pulse, reaching their maximal values for the linear
polarization. Therefore, we focus on this case. Specifically, we analyze the
dependence of pair creation on the relative configuration of linear
polarizations of the laser pulse and the nonlaser photon. Lastly, we
investigate the carrier-envelope phase effect on angular distributions of

If it loses enough mass, it ends up a hot HB star (or in the field an sdB star)
with effective temperatures larger than 11000 K. All sdB stars are observed to
have an approximately solar iron abundance whatever their original metallicity,
implying overabundances by factors of up to 100. So should the 0.95 solar mass
star. How its internal hydrodynamic properties on the main sequence may
influence its fate on the HB is currently uncertain.

The helium vessels surrounding the RF cavities, portions of the niobium
cavities themselves, and also possibly the vacuum vessels containing these

laboratories to follow national consensus pressure vessel standards or to show
""a level of safety greater than or equal to"" that of the applicable standard.
Thus, while used for its superconducting properties, niobium ends up being
treated as a low-temperature pressure vessel material. Niobium material is not
a code listed material and therefore requires the designer to understand the
mechanical properties for material used in each pressure vessel fabrication;
compliance with pressure vessel codes therefore becomes a problem. This report

testing algorithms (PIT) for algebraic branching programs (ABPs) that are

identity testing algorithm (due to Raz and Shpilka), but prior to this work
there was no known such black-box algorithm.
  The main result of this work gives the first quasi-polynomial sized hitting
sets for size S circuits from this class, when the order of the variables is
known. As our hitting set is of size exp(lg^2 S), this is analogous (in the
terminology of boolean pseudorandomness) to a seed-length of lg^2 S, which is
the seed length of the pseudorandom generators of Nisan and
Impagliazzo-Nisan-Wigderson for read-once oblivious boolean branching programs.
  Our results are stronger for branching programs of bounded width, where we
give a hitting set of size exp(lg^2 S/lglg S), corresponding to a seed length
of lg^2 S/lglg S. This is in stark contrast to the known results for read-once
oblivious boolean branching programs of bounded width, where no pseudorandom
generator (or hitting set) with seed length o(lg^2 S) is known.
  In follow up work, we strengthened a result of Mulmuley, and showed that
derandomizing a particular case of the Noether Normalization Lemma is reducible
to black-box PIT of read-once oblivious ABPs. Using the results of the present
work, this gives a derandomization of Noether Normalization in that case, which
Mulmuley conjectured would difficult due to its relations to problems in
algebraic geometry.

nor the correlation of RM strength with MgII absorption lines found in Bernet

model assumes that the Faraday Rotators, namely the QSO's host galaxy and the
intervening MgII host galaxies along the line of sight, contain partially
inhomogeneous RM screens. We find that this leads to an increasing
depolarization towards longer wavelengths and to wavelength dependent RM
values. In particular, due to cosmological redshift, observations at fixed
wavelength of sources at different redshift are affected differently by
depolarization and are sensitive to different Faraday active components. For
example, at 21 cm the polarized signal is averaged out by inhomogeneous Faraday
screens and the measured RM mostly reflects the Milky Way contributions for low
redshift QSOs, while polarization is relatively unaffected for high redshift
QSOs. Similar effects are produced by intervening galaxies acting as
inhomogeneous screens. Finally, we assess the performance of Rotation Measure
synthesis on our synthetic models and conclude that the study of magnetic
fields in galaxies as a function of cosmic time will benefit considerably from
the application of such a technique, provided enough instrumental bandwidth.
For this purpose, high frequency channels appear preferable but not strictly

typically been interpreted using models that assumed solar elemental
abundances. With the chemical composition fixed, attempts have been made to
classify hot Jupiter atmospheres on the basis of stellar irradiation. However,
recent observations have revealed deviations from predictions based on such
classification schemes, and chemical compositions retrieved from some datasets
have also indicated non-solar abundances. In hot hydrogen-dominated
atmospheres, the C/O ratio critically influences the relative concentrations of
several spectroscopically dominant molecules. Between a C/O of 0.5 (solar
value) and 2, the H2O and CH4 abundances can vary by several orders of
magnitude in the observable atmosphere, and new hydrocarbon species such as HCN
and C2H2 become prominent for C/O >= 1, while the CO abundance remains almost
unchanged. Furthermore, a C/O >= 1 can preclude a strong thermal inversion due
to TiO and VO in a hot Jupiter atmosphere, since TiO and VO are naturally
under-abundant for C/O >= 1. We, therefore, suggest a new two-dimensional
classification scheme for hydrogen-dominated exoplanetary atmospheres with
irradiation (or temperature) and C/O ratio as the two dimensions. We define
four classes in this 2-D space (O1, O2, C1, and C2) with distinct chemical,
thermal and spectral properties. We characterize the thermal structures and C/O
ratios of six hot Jupiters (XO-1b, CoRoT-2b, WASP-14b, WASP-19b, WASP-33b, and
WASP-12b) in the framework of our proposed 2D classification scheme. While the
data for several systems in our sample are consistent with carbon-rich

constrain the C/O ratios in their atmospheres. We discuss how observations

star-forming galaxies in the Universe. Historically, galaxy formation models
have had difficulty explaining the observed number counts of SMGs. We combine a
semi-empirical model with 3-D hydrodynamical simulations and 3-D dust radiative
transfer to predict the number counts of unlensed SMGs. Because the stellar
mass functions, gas and dust masses, and sizes of our galaxies are constrained
to match observations, we can isolate uncertainties related to the dynamical
evolution of galaxy mergers and the dust radiative transfer. The number counts
and redshift distributions predicted by our model agree well with observations.
Isolated disc galaxies dominate the faint (S_1.1 < ~1 mJy, or S_850 < ~2 mJy)
population. The brighter sources are a mix of merger-induced starbursts and
galaxy-pair SMGs; the latter subpopulation accounts for ~30 - 50 per cent of
all SMGs at all S_1.1 > ~0.5 mJy (S_850 > ~1 mJy). The mean redshifts are ~3.0
- 3.5, depending on the flux cut, and the brightest sources tend to be at
higher redshifts. Because the galaxy-pair SMGs will be resolved into multiple
fainter sources by ALMA, the bright ALMA counts should be as much as 2 times
less than those observed using single-dish telescopes. The agreement between
our model, which uses a Kroupa IMF, and observations suggests that the IMF in
high-redshifts starbursts need not be top-heavy; if the IMF were top-heavy, our
model would over-predict the number counts. We conclude that the difficulty
some models have reproducing the observed SMG counts is likely indicative of
more general problems -- such as an under-prediction of the abundance of
massive galaxies or a star formation rate--stellar mass relation normalisation
lower than that observed -- rather than a problem specific to the SMG
population.

three luminosity bins and stack the Herschel SPIRE data to measure the average
spectral energy distribution (SED) of LBGs at far-infrared (FIR) wavelengths.
We find that these galaxies have average IR luminosities of (3-5)x10^{11}L_sun
and 60-70% of their star-formation obscured by dust. The FIR SEDs peak at
lambda>100um, suggesting dust temperatures (T_d=27-30K) significantly colder
than that of local galaxies of comparable IR luminosities. The observed
IR-to-UV luminosity ratio (IRX=L_IR/L_UV) is low (~3-4) compared with that
observed for z~2 LBGs (IRX(z~2)~7.1+/-1.1). The correlation between the slope
of the UV continuum and IRX for galaxies in the two lower luminosity bins
suggests dust properties similar to those of local starburst galaxies. However,
the galaxies in the highest luminosity bin appear to deviate from the local
relation, suggesting that their dust properties may differ from those of their

separation distributions in the different regions are statistically
indistinguishable over most separation ranges, and the regions with higher
densities do not exhibit a lower proportion of wide (300-620au) relative to
close (62-300au) binaries as might be expected from the preferential
destruction of wider pairs. Only the closest (19-100au) separation range, which
would be unaffected by dynamical processing, shows a possible difference in
separation distributions between different regions. The combined set of young

stellar photometry from a section of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury

observations. We find that the ratio of BHB to red giant stars is relatively
constant outside of 10 kpc, suggesting that the BHB is as reliable a tracer of
the halo population as the red giant branch. In the inner halo, we do not
expect BHB stars to be produced by the high metallicity bulge and disk, making
BHB stars a good candidate to be a reliable tracer of the stellar halo to much
smaller galactocentric distances. If we assume a power-law profile r^(-\alpha)
for the 2-D projected surface density BHB distribution, we obtain a
high-quality fit with a 2-D power-law index of \alpha=2.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2} outside

consistent with previous measurements but is anchored to a radial baseline that
extends much farther inward. Finally, assuming azimuthal symmetry and a
constant mass-to-light ratio, the best-fitting profile yields a total halo
stellar mass of 2.1^{+1.7}_{-0.4} x 10^9 M_sun. These properties are comparable

to understand how the structure of social interactions shapes the time course

context. However, awareness of an epidemic in a population typically yields
behavioral changes that correspond to changes in the network structure on which
the disease evolves. This feedback mechanism has not been investigated in
depth. For example, one would intuitively expect susceptible individuals to
avoid other infecteds. However, doctors treating patients or parents tending
sick children may also increase the amount of contact made with an infecteds,
in an effort to speed up recovery but also exposing themselves to higher risks
of infection. We study the role of these caretaker links in an adaptive network

amount of contact they make with infected individuals. We find that pure
avoidance, with only few caretaker links, is the best strategy for curtailing

(12.10,12.95) Msun while for the satellite AGN HOD we find a preference for an
increasing AGN fraction with Mh suggesting that the average number of AGN in
satellite galaxies grows slower (alpha_s < 0.6) than the linear proportion
(alpha_s = 1) observed for the satellite HOD of samples of galaxies. We present
an estimate of the projected auto correlation function (ACF) of galaxy groups
over the range of r_p = 0.1-40 Mpc/h at <z> = 0.5. We use the large-scale
clustering signal to verify the agreement between the group bias estimated by
using the observed galaxy groups ACF and the value derived from the group mass
estimates. We perform a measurement of the projected AGN-galaxy group
cross-correlation function, excluding from the analysis AGN that are within
galaxy groups and we model the 2-halo term of the clustering signal with the
mean AGN HOD based on our results.

single such event is expected over about a three-year period in IC. We also
show that, if event rates remain at their current levels then, even with the

Moreover, if muon-tracks remain conspicuous by their absence, then new physics
needs to be invoked. As example scenarios in conformity with the observations,
we calculate event rates for neutrino decay and Lorentz-invariance violation.

characterizing the ground states of quantum field theories. In this paper we
investigate the extent to which these are universal quantities for a given
theory, and to which they distinguish different theories, by comparing the
entanglement spectra of the massless Dirac fermion and the compact free boson
in two dimensions. We show that the calculation of Renyi entropies via the
replica trick for any orbifold theory includes a sum over orbifold twists on
all cycles. In a modular-invariant theory of fermions, this amounts to a sum
over spin structures. The result is that the Renyi entropies respect the
standard Bose-Fermi duality. Next, we investigate the entanglement spectrum for
the Dirac fermion without a sum over spin structures, and for the compact boson
at the self-dual radius. These are not equivalent theories; nonetheless, we
find that (1) their second Renyi entropies agree for any number of intervals,
(2) their full entanglement spectra agree for two intervals, and (3) the
spectrum generically disagrees otherwise. These results follow from the
equality of the partition functions of the two theories on any Riemann surface
with imaginary period matrix. We also exhibit a map between the operators of
the theories that preserves scaling dimensions (but not spins), as well as OPEs
and correlators of operators placed on the real line. All of these coincidences
can be traced to the fact that the momentum lattice for the bosonized fermion

the cathode magnetic field up to the maximum value presently available of 250

facility located at Fermilab. The facility is designed to aim a beam of
neutrinos toward a detector placed at the Deep Underground Science and
Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL) in South Dakota. The neutrinos are produced in a
three-step process. First, protons from the Main Injector hit a solid target
and produce mesons. Then, the charged mesons are focused by a set of focusing
horns into the decay pipe, towards the far detector. Finally, the mesons that
enter the decay pipe decay into neutrinos. The parameters of the facility were
determined by an amalgam of the physics goals, the Monte Carlo modeling of the

lead to phase locking of the objects' orientation. We identify conditions for

which,for cool white dwarfs, sensitively depends on the treatment of the outer
boundary conditions. We provide detailed outer boundary conditions appropriate
for computing the evolution of cool white dwarfs employing detailed non-gray
model atmospheres for pure H composition. We also explore the impact on the
white dwarf cooling times of different assumptions for energy transfer in the
atmosphere of cool white dwarfs. Detailed non-gray model atmospheres are
computed taken into account non-ideal effects in the gas equation of state and
chemical equilibrium, collision-induced absorption from molecules, and the
Lyman alpha quasi-molecular opacity. Our results show that the use of detailed
outer boundary conditions becomes relevant for effective temperatures lower
than 5800 and 6100K for sequences with 0.60 and 0.90 M_sun, respectively.
Detailed model atmospheres predict ages that are up to approx 10% shorter at
log L/L_sun=-4 when compared with the ages derived using Eddington-like
approximations at tau_Ross=2/3. We also analyze the effects of various
assumptions and physical processes of relevance in the calculation of outer
boundary conditions. In particular, we find that the Ly_alpha red wing
absorption does not affect substantially the evolution of white dwarfs. White
dwarf cooling timescales are sensitive to the surface boundary conditions for
T_eff < 6000K. Interestingly enough, non-gray effects have little consequences
on these cooling times at observable luminosities. In fact, collision-induced
absorption processes, which significantly affect the spectra and colors of old
white dwarfs with hydrogen-rich atmospheres, have not noticeable effects in
their cooling rates, except throughout the Rosseland mean opacity.

to understand their three-dimensional structure. We present measurements of the
stellar velocity dispersion in NGC 1569, a nearby post-starburst dIm galaxy.
The stellar vertical velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm z}$, coupled with the
maximum rotational velocity derived from \ion{H}{1} observations, $V_{\rm
max}$, gives a measure of how kinematically hot the galaxy is, and, therefore,
indicates its structure. We conclude that the stars in NGC 1569 are in a thick
disk with a $V_{\rm max} / \sigma_{\rm z}$ = 2.4 $\pm$ 0.7. In addition to the
structure, we analyze the ionized gas kinematics from \ion{O}{3} observations
along the morphological major axis. These data show evidence for outflow from
the inner starburst region and a potential expanding shell near supermassive
star cluster (SSC) A. When compared to the stellar kinematics, the velocity
dispersion of the stars increase in the region of SSC A supporting the
hypothesis of an expanding shell. The stellar kinematics closely follow the
motion of the gas. Analysis of high resolution \ion{H}{1} data clearly reveals
the presence of an \ion{H}{1} cloud that appears to be impacting the eastern
edge of NGC 1569. Also, an ultra-dense \ion{H}{1} cloud can be seen extending
to the west of the impacting \ion{H}{1} cloud. This dense cloud is likely the
remains of a dense \ion{H}{1} bridge that extended through what is now the
central starburst area. The impacting \ion{H}{1} cloud was the catalyst for the
starburst, thus turning the dense gas into stars over a short timescale, $\sim$
1 Gyr. We performed a careful study of the spectral energy distribution using
infrared, optical, and ultraviolet photometry producing a state-of-the-art mass
model for the stellar disk. This mass modeling shows that stars dominate the
gravitational potential in the inner 1 kpc.

accommodate the volume change and an upper limit to the geometrically necessary

Al-17In alloy. Thermomechanical processing is also used to change the size and
distribution of the indium particles within the aluminum matrix. Dislocation
generation with accompanied acoustic emission occurs when the melting indium
particles are associated with grain boundaries or upon solidification where the
solid-liquid interfaces act as free surfaces to facilitate dislocation
generation. Acoustic emission is not observed for indium particles that require
super heating and exhibit elevated melting temperatures. The acoustic emission
work corroborates previously proposed relaxation mechanisms from prior internal
friction studies and that the superheat observed for melting of these

a degeneracy under the simultaneous exchange of both hierarchy and the sign of
$\theta_{13}$ remains. Matter effects break this symmetry such that the
positions of the peaks in the oscillation probabilities maintain the two-fold
symmetry, while the magnitude of the oscillations is sensitive to the
hierarchy. This renders T2K and NO$\nu$A, with different baselines and
different matter effects, better able in combination to distinguish the

single CPU. Our formalism facilitates an efficient approach to computing Cosmic
Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies for cosmic strings. Discretising the
UETC and performing an eigen-decomposition to act as sources in the CAMB CMB
code, the power spectrum can be calculated by summing over a finite number of
eigenmodes. A much smaller number of eigenmodes are required compared to the
conventional approach of averaging power spectra over a finite number of
realisations of the string network. With the additional efficiency and
performance improvements offered by the OpenMP CAMB code, the time required to
compute string power spectra is significantly reduced compared to the standard
serial CMBACT code. The latter takes ~30 hours on a modern single threaded CPU
for 2000 network realisations. Similar percent level accuracy can be achieved
with our approach on a moderately threaded CPU (8 threads) in only ~15 minutes.
If accuracy is only required at the 10 percent level and the CPU is more highly
threaded, cosmic string power spectra are now possible in ~2-3 minutes. This
makes exploration of the string parameter space now possible for
Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC) analysis.

  For symmetric Cartan matrices, weighted KLR algebras also have a natural
gometric interpretation as convolution algebras, generalizing that for the

consequences important in the theory of crystal bases. In this case, we can
also relate the Grothendieck group and its bialgebra structure to the Hall

negative velocity was possibly caused by the ejection of a new component, which

well as borders. We also apply this technique to power grid networks, showing,
quantitatively, that the continental European power grid is substantially more
planar than the network covering the western states of US, which present
topological dimension higher than their intrinsic embedding space dimension.
Local dimension also successfully revealed how distinct regions of network
topologies spreads along the degrees of freedom when it is embedded in a metric

(SRC) effects with the special emphasis given to the recent observation of the
correlation between the slope of the EMC ratio at Bjorken x<1 and the scale
factor of the same ratio at x>1 that measures the strength of the SRCs in
nuclei. This correlation may indicate the larger modification of nucleons with
higher momentum thus making the nucleon virtuality as the most relevant
parameter of medium modifications. To check this conjecture we study the
implication of several properties of high momentum component of the nuclear
wave function on the characteristics of EMC effect. We observe two main reasons
for the EMC-SRC correlation: first, the decrease of the contribution from the
nuclear mean field due to the increase, with A, the fraction of the high
momentum component of nuclear wave function. Second, the increase of the medium
modification of nucleons in SRC. Our main prediction however is the increase of
the proton contribution to the EMC effect for large A asymmetric nuclei. This
prediction is based on the recent observation of the strong dominance of pn
SRCs in the high momentum component of nuclear wave function. Our preliminary
calculation based on this prediction of the excess of energetic and modified
protons in large A nuclei describes reasonably well the main features of the
observed EMC-SRC correlation.

""instantaneous"" braking index of a pulsar may be different from the ""averaged""
braking index obtained from fitting the data over a certain time span. The
close match between our model-predicted ""instantaneous"" braking indices and the
observed ""averaged"" braking indices suggests that the time spans used
previously are usually smaller than or comparable to their magnetic field
oscillation periods. Our model can be tested with the existing data, by
calculating the braking index as a function of the time span for each pulsar.
In doing so, one can obtain for each pulsar all the parameters in our magnetic
field evolution model, and may be able to improve the sensitivity of using
pulsars to detect gravitational waves.

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/759/1/58",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The shallow decay phase or plateau phase of early afterglows of gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs), discovered by Swift, is currently understood as being due to
energy injection to a relativistic blast wave. One natural scenario for energy
injection invokes a millisecond magnetar as the central engine of GRBs, because
the conventional model of a pulsar predicts a nearly constant
magnetic-dipole-radiation luminosity within the spin-down timescale. However,
we note that significant brightening occurs in some early afterglows, which
apparently conflicts with the above scenario. Here we propose a new model to
explain this significant brightening phenomena by considering a hyperaccreting
fallback disk around a newborn millisecond magnetar. We show that for typical
values of the model parameters, sufficient angular momentum of the accreted
matter is transferred to the magnetar and spins it up. It is this spin-up that
leads to a dramatic increase of the magnetic dipole radiation luminosity with
time and thus significant brightening of an early afterglow. Based on this
model, we carry out numerical calculations and fit well early afterglows of 12
GRBs assuming sufficiently strong fallback accretion. If the accretion is very
weak, our model turns out to be the conventional energy-injection scenario of a
pulsar. Therefore, our model can provide a unified explanation for the shallow
decay phase, plateaus, and significant brightening of early afterglows.

the higher interface conductivity, the weaker spin injection efficiency, and
the transmission due to Fermi energy of spin up and spin down is different from

depending on the magnetic field, and the spin injection efficiency vibrates
sensitively according to the magnetic field. In TI / DMS heterogeneous

investigated. Here, when the magnetic field is low, the spin current
oscillates, and as the magnetic field increases, the vibration is attenuated.
It also decreases with increasing temperature and weakens vibrations. This is
due to the competitive effect of the chiral properties of Dirac type
quasiparticles in the topological insulator and the unique properties of
exchange interaction between electrons and ions in DMS. This result allows us
to expect the possibility of spintronic devices with high sensitivity to

difference (B-V-c) between the true B-V color and the fitted color (c) from the

includes 251 ugriz light curves from the 3-season Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II,
and 191 griz light curves from the Supernova Legacy Survey 3-year data release.
We find that the simplest model of a wavelength-independent (coherent) scatter
is not adequate, and that to describe the data the intrinsic scatter model must
have wavelength-dependent variations. We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine
the standard approach of adding a coherent scatter term in quadrature to the
distance-modulus uncertainty in order to bring the reduced chi2 to unity when
fitting a Hubble diagram. If the light curve fits include model uncertainties
with the correct wavelength dependence of the scatter, we find that the bias on
the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ is negligible. However,
incorrect model uncertainties can lead to a significant bias on the distance
moduli, with up to ~0.05 mag redshift-dependent variation. For the recent SNLS3
cosmology results we estimate that this effect introduces an additional
systematic uncertainty on $w$ of ~0.02, well below the total uncertainty.
However, this uncertainty depends on the samples used, and thus this small
$w$-uncertainty is not guaranteed in future cosmology results.

nano-composites exhibiting sharp electrical property gains at and above
percolation threshold, which motivated us to revisit the classical setting of
percolation in random resistor networks but from a multiscale perspective. For
each realization of random resistor networks above threshold, we use network
graph representations and associated algorithms to identify and restrict to the
percolating component, thereby preconditioning the network both in size and
accuracy by filtering {\it a priori} zero current-carrying bonds. We then
simulate many realizations per bond density and analyze scaling behavior of the
complete current distribution supported on the percolating component. We first
confirm the celebrated power-law distribution of small currents at the
percolation threshold, and second we confirm results on scaling of the maximum
current in the network that is associated with the backbone of the percolating
cluster. These properties are then placed in context with global features of
the current distribution, and in particular the dominant role of the large
current tail that is most relevant for material science applications. We
identify a robust, exponential large current tail that: 1. persists above
threshold; 2. expands broadly over and dominates the current distribution at
the expense of the vanishing power law scaling in the small current tail; and
3. by taking second moments, reproduces the experimentally observed power law
scaling of bulk conductivity above threshold.

This point-of-view follows from the natural assumption that fainter objects
should, on average, lie at larger redshifts. However, redshifts larger than 5
are rare for bursts observed by Swift. The purpose of this article is to show
that the most distant bursts in general need not be the faintest ones. We
derive the cosmological relationships between the observed and emitted
quantities, and arrive at a prediction that is tested on the ensembles of
BATSE, Swift and Fermi bursts. This analysis is independent on the assumed
cosmology, on the observational biases, as well as on any gamma-ray burst
model. We arrive to the conclusion that apparently fainter bursts need not, in
general, lie at large redshifts. Such a behaviour is possible, when the
luminosities (or emitted energies) in a sample of bursts increase more than the
dimming of the observed values with redshift. In such a case dP(z)/dz > 0 can
hold, where P(z) is either the peak-flux or the fluence. This also means that
the hundreds of faint, long-duration BATSE bursts need not lie at high
redshifts, and that the observed redshift distribution of long Swift bursts
might actually represent the actual distribution.

galactic outflows and photoionisation heating on the volume-averaged
recombination rate of the intergalactic medium (IGM). By incorporating an
evolving ionising escape fraction and a treatment for self-shielding within
Lyman limit systems, we have run the first simulations of ""photon-starved""
reionisation scenarios that simultaneously reproduce observations of the
abundance of galaxies, the optical depth to electron scattering of cosmic
microwave background photons \tau, and the effective optical depth to
Lyman\alpha absorption at z=5. We confirm that an ionising background reduces
the clumping factor C by more than 50% by smoothing moderately-overdense
(\Delta=1--100) regions. Meanwhile, outflows increase clumping only modestly.
The clumping factor of ionised gas is much lower than the overall baryonic
clumping factor because the most overdense gas is self-shielded.
Photoionisation heating further suppresses recombinations if reionisation heats
gas above the canonical 10,000 K. Accounting for both effects within our most
realistic simulation, C rises from <1 at z>10 to 3.3 at z=6. We show that
incorporating temperature- and ionisation-corrected clumping factors into an
analytical reionisation model reproduces the numerical simulation's \tau to
within 10%. Finally, we explore how many ionising photons are absorbed during
the process of heating filaments by considering the overall photon cost of
reionisation in analytical models that assume that the IGM is heated at
different redshifts. For reionisation redshifts of 9--10, cold filaments boost
the reionisation photon budget by ~1 photon per hydrogen atom.

dispersion of (1440 +130/-110) km/s (890 km/s when the correct relativistic
equation is used), however, is inflated by infall along the line of sight, as
the result of a complex merger of at least three sub-clusters. One collision
proceeds close to head-on, while the second features a significant impact
parameter. The temperature variations in the intra-cluster gas, two tentative
cold fronts, the radial velocities measured for cluster galaxies, and the small
offsets between collisional and non-collisional cluster components all suggest
that both merger events are observed close to core passage and along axes that
are greatly inclined with respect to the plane of the sky. A strong-lensing
analysis of the system anchored upon three triple-image systems (two of which
have spectroscopic redshifts) yields independent constraints on the mass
distribution. For a gas fraction of 8.2%, the resulting strong-lensing mass
profile is in good agreement with our X-ray estimates, and the details of the

open quantum system, whose dynamics is governed by a master equation obtained

the geometric phase of the atom turns out to be affected by the space-time
curvature which backscatters the vacuum field modes. In both the Unruh and
Hartle-Hawking vacua, the geometric phase exhibits similar behaviors as if
there were thermal radiation at the Hawking temperature from the black hole.
So, a measurement of the change of the geometric phase as opposed to that in a

superconductivity is not observed down to 2K. The magneto-transport [R(T)H]
measurements exhibited the upper critical field [Hc2(0)] of up to 300kOe. The
flux flow activation energy (U/kB) is estimated ~98.37K for 0.1T field.
Magnetic susceptibility measurements also confirms bulk superconductivity for x

at 2K for x = 0.06 sample. Heat capacity CP(T) measurements exhibited a hump
like transition pertaining to SDW in Fe planes at around 150K and an AFM
ordering of Sm spins below temperature of 5.4K for ordered Sm spins [TN(Sm)].
Though, the SDW hump for Fe spins disappears for Ni doped samples, the TN (Sm)
remains unaltered but with a reduced transition height, i.e., decreased

HrcA repression in the latter. We demonstrate that both systems, in spite of
the difference at the TF regulation level, are capable of showing very similar

sigma32 to chaperon DnaK, known to be in 100 nM range, set the lower limit of

black hole candidate. Recently, it has received a considerable attention due to
the detection of peculiar variability patterns known as `heartbeats', which are
quasi-periodic mini-outbursts repeated over timescales ranging between 5 and 70
s. So far, such variability patterns have been observed only in GRS 1915+105
and these are classified as $\rho$- and $\nu$-variability classes. Here, we
present the results of `phase-resolved' spectroscopy of the `heartbeat'
oscillations of IGR J17091-3624 using data from simultaneous observations made
by RXTE and XMM-Newton. We find that the 0.7--35 keV spectra can be fitted with
a `canonical' model for black hole sources consisting of only two
components---a multi-temperature disk black body and a power law (or its
equivalent). We attempt to constrain the system parameters of the source by
simultaneously fitting spectra during different phases of the burst profile
while tying the system parameters across the phases. The results indicate that
the source is a high inclination binary ($i$>53$^\circ$). Further, the observed
low flux from the source can be explained only if the black hole spin is very
low, along with constraints on the black hole mass (<5 M$_\odot$) and the
distance (>20 kpc). For higher inclination angles, which is favored by the
data, the black hole spin is required to be negative. Thus, low or retrograde
spin could be the reason for the low luminosity of the source.

the final stellar mass is set by the interplay between protostellar accretion

a few hours. For 4 of these blazars the near-IR to UV data show the presence of
an accretion disc, and we could reliably estimate its accretion rate and black
hole mass. One of them, PKS 1348+007, was found in an extraordinarily high
IR-optical state, almost two orders of magnitude brighter than at the epoch of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey observations. For all the 5 quasars the physical
parameters of the jet emitting zone, derived by applying a one-zone emission
model, are similar to that found for the bulk of other gamma-ray loud quasars.
With our observations we have X-ray data for the full sample of blazars at z>2
present in the Fermi 2-yrs (2LAC) catalog. This allows to have a rather
complete view of the spectral energy distribution of all high-redshift Fermi
blazars, and to draw some conclusions about their properties, and especially
about the relation between the accretion rate and the jet power.

development effort. In this paper, a framework is proposed to evaluate and
investigate the situation of an organization in terms of effort estimation. The
proposed framework includes various indicators which cover the critical issues
in field of software development effort estimation. Since the capabilities and
shortages of organizations for effort estimation are not the same, the proposed
indicators can lead to have a systematic approach in which the strengths and
weaknesses of organizations in field of effort estimation are discovered.

frameworks of climate modelling: conceptual, simulator-based (including general
circulation models and Earth system models of intermediate complexity), and
statistical. The conceptual framework aims at a parsimonious representation of
a given climate phenomenon; the simulator-based framework connects physical and
biogeochemical principles with phenomena at different spatial and temporal
scales; and statistical modelling is a framework for inference from
observations, given hypotheses on systematic and random effects. Recently,
solutions have been proposed in the literature to combine these frameworks, and
new concepts have emerged: the emulator (a statistical, computing efficient
surrogate for the simulator) and the discrepancy, which is a statistical
representation of the difference between the simulator and the real phenomenon.
These concepts are explained, with references to implementations for both

morphological differences along the anterior-posterior axis of animals and are
generally regarded as highly conserved in function. This view is based on
experiments comparing a few (anterior) Hox proteins, however, the extent to
which central or abdominal Hox proteins share sequence features or functions
remains largely unexplored. To shed light on the origin and functional
divergence of the central Hox proteins, we combine a powerful bioinformatics
tool (CLANS) with a large-scale phylogeny of species. CLANS is used to
differentiate between the various types of central Hox protein sequences, while
the phylogeny provides an evolutionary context to the analysis. The combination
of both enables us to infer the relative timepoint at which a given central Hox
protein type arose. We identify seven distinct central Hox protein sequence
types, only one of which is common to all protostome and deuterostome clades
(Antp/Hox7). Together, these results lead us to suggest reevaluating the
usefulness of the increasingly depicted synteny-based classification scheme
that assumes a one-to-one orthology between protostome and deuterostome central
Hox proteins. Instead, we propose that the use of sequence-based classification
schemes able to resolve the central and posterior Hox proteins provides a more
promising and biologically meaningful alternative to resolving these groups.
This analysis, which provides a unique overview of the Hox protein sequence
types present across protostomes and deuterostomes as well as a relative dating
for the emergence of the central Hox protein types, provides a crucial clue to
illuminate how and when the distinct developmental blueprints for organisms
evolved within the evolutionarily immensely successful bilaterian lineage.

worldwide. It is used throughout Europe and much of Asia, and is starting to be
introduced in North America too. Payment cards contain a chip so they can
execute an authentication protocol. This protocol requires point-of-sale (POS)
terminals or ATMs to generate a nonce, called the unpredictable number, for
each transaction to ensure it is fresh. We have discovered that some EMV
implementers have merely used counters, timestamps or home-grown algorithms to
supply this number. This exposes them to a ""pre-play"" attack which is
indistinguishable from card cloning from the standpoint of the logs available
to the card-issuing bank, and can be carried out even if it is impossible to
clone a card physically (in the sense of extracting the key material and
loading it into another card). Card cloning is the very type of fraud that EMV
was supposed to prevent. We describe how we detected the vulnerability, a
survey methodology we developed to chart the scope of the weakness, evidence
from ATM and terminal experiments in the field, and our implementation of
proof-of-concept attacks. We found flaws in widely-used ATMs from the largest
manufacturers. We can now explain at least some of the increasing number of
frauds in which victims are refused refunds by banks which claim that EMV cards
cannot be cloned and that a customer involved in a dispute must therefore be
mistaken or complicit. Pre-play attacks may also be carried out by malware in
an ATM or POS terminal, or by a man-in-the-middle between the terminal and the
acquirer. We explore the design and implementation mistakes that enabled the
flaw to evade detection until now: shortcomings of the EMV specification, of
the EMV kernel certification process, of implementation testing, formal
analysis, or monitoring customer complaints. Finally we discuss
countermeasures.

astronomy is a promising tool to test and validate GR and/or potential
alternative theories of gravity. The information that a GW waveform carries not
only will allow us to map the strong gravitational field of its source, but
also determine the theory of gravity ruling its dynamics. In this work, we
explore the extent to which we could distinguish between GR and other theories
of gravity through the detection of low-frequency GWs from extreme-mass-ratio
inspirals (EMRIs) and, in particular, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons
modified gravity (DCSMG). To that end, we develop a framework that enables us,
for the first time, to perform a parameter estimation analysis for EMRIs in
DCSMG. Our model is described by a 15-dimensional parameter space, that
includes the Chern-Simons (CS) parameter which characterises the deviation
between the two theories, and our analysis is based on Fisher information
matrix techniques together with a (maximum-mismatch) criterion to assess the
validity of our results. In our analysis, we study a 5-dimensional parameter
space, finding that a GW detector like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna
(LISA) or eLISA (evolved LISA) should be able to discriminate between GR and
DCSMG with fractional errors below 5%, and hence place bounds four orders of

interpreted as slow magneto-acoustic waves and/or periodic upflows. Here we aim
to understand their nature from the observed properties using a three-hour
imaging sequence from AIA/SDO in two different temperature channels. We also
compare the characteristics with a simple wave model. We searched for
propagating disturbances in open-loop structures at three different locations;
a fan loop-structure off-limb, an on-disk plume-like structure and the
plume/interplume regions in the north pole of the sun. In each of the subfield
regions chosen to cover these structures, the time series at each pixel
location was subjected to wavelet analysis to find the different periodicities.
We then constructed powermaps in three different period ranges. We also
constructed space-time maps for the on-disk plume structure to estimate the
propagation speeds in different channels. We find propagating disturbances in
all three structures. Powermaps indicate that the power in the long-period
range is significant up to comparatively longer distances along the loop than
that in the shorter periods. This nature is observed in all three structures. A
detailed analysis on the on-disk plume structure gives consistently higher
propagation speeds in the 193 \AA channel and also reveals spatial damping
along the loop. The amplitude and the damping length values are lower in hotter
channels, indicating their acoustic dependence. These properties can be
explained very well with a propagating slow-wave model. We suggest that these
disturbances are more likely to be caused by propagating slow magneto-acoustic
waves than by high-speed quasi-periodic upflows. We find that intensity
oscillations in longer periods are omnipresent at larger heights even in active
regions.

networks allows unlikely diseases with low infection rates to spread and become
endemic. However, in particular for potentially fatal diseases, also the impact

complex interplay. Here, we consider the growth of a network by preferential
attachment from which nodes are simultaneously removed due to an SIR epidemic.
We show that increased infectiousness increases the prevalence of the disease

Although a transition to a degree distribution with finite variance takes
place, the network still exhibits no epidemic threshold in the thermodynamic
limit. We illustrate these results using agent-based simulations and
analytically tractable approximation schemes.

parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes to binary input inter-symbol interference (ISI)
channels. Two low-complexity joint detection/decoding algorithms are proposed.
One is referred to as max-log-MAP/X-EMS algorithm, which is implemented by
exchanging soft messages between the max-log-MAP detector and the extended
min-sum (EMS) decoder. The max-log-MAP/X-EMS algorithm is applicable to general
NB-LDPC codes. The other one, referred to as Viterbi/GMLGD algorithm, is
designed in particular for majority-logic decodable NB-LDPC codes. The
Viterbi/GMLGD algorithm works in an iterative manner by exchanging
hard-decisions between the Viterbi detector and the generalized majority-logic
decoder(GMLGD). As a by-product, a variant of the original EMS algorithm is
proposed, which is referred to as \mu-EMS algorithm. In the \mu-EMS algorithm,
the messages are truncated according to an adaptive threshold, resulting in a
more efficient algorithm. Simulations results show that the max-log-MAP/X-EMS
algorithm performs as well as the traditional iterative detection/decoding
algorithm based on the BCJR algorithm and the QSPA, but with lower complexity.
The complexity can be further reduced for majority-logic decodable NB-LDPC
codes by executing the Viterbi/GMLGD algorithm with a performance degradation
within one dB. Simulation results also confirm that the \mu-EMS algorithm
requires lower computational loads than the EMS algorithm with a fixed
threshold. These algorithms provide good candidates for trade-offs between
performance and complexity.

The team consists of players with different measurements about the state of
nature. The objective of the team is to minimize a quadratic cost subject to
additional finite number of quadratic constraints. We will first consider the
Gaussian case, where the state of nature is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution, and show that the linear decisions are optimal and can be found
by solving a semidefinite program We then consider the problem of minimizing a
quadratic objective for the worst case scenario, subject to an arbitrary number
of deterministic quadratic constraints. We show that linear decisions can be
found by solving a semidefinite program.

been the increase of useful models that beneficially explain the development of
life cycle and precisely calculate the effort of software cost estimation. In
analogy concept, there is deficiency in handling the datasets containing
categorical variables though there are innumerable methods to estimate the
cost. Due to the nature of software engineering domain, generally project
attributes are often measured in terms of linguistic values such as very low,
low, high and very high. The imprecise nature of such value represents the
uncertainty and vagueness in their elucidation. However, there is no efficient
method that can directly deal with the categorical variables and tolerate such
imprecision and uncertainty without taking the classical intervals and numeric
value approaches. In this paper, a new approach for optimization based on fuzzy
logic, linguistic quantifiers and analogy based reasoning is proposed to
improve the performance of the effort in software project when they are
described in either numerical or categorical data. The performance of this
proposed method exemplifies a pragmatic validation based on the historical NASA
dataset. The results were analyzed using the prediction criterion and indicates
that the proposed method can produce more explainable results than other
machine learning methods.

features of E-mail such as its speed, reliability, efficient storage options
and a large number of added facilities make it highly popular among people from
all sectors of business and society. But being largely popular has its negative
aspects too. E-mails are the preferred medium for a large number of attacks
over the internet. Some of the most popular attacks over the internet include
spams, and phishing mails. Both spammers and phishers utilize E-mail services
quite efficiently in spite of a large number of detection and prevention
techniques already in place. Very few methods are actually good in
detection/prevention of spam/phishing related mails but they have higher false
positives. These techniques are implemented at the server and in addition to
giving higher number of false positives, they add to the processing load on the
server. This paper outlines a novel approach to detect not only spam, but also
scams, phishing and advertisement related mails. In this method, we overcome
the limitations of server-side detection techniques by utilizing some
intelligence on the part of users. Keywords parsing, token separation and
knowledge bases are used in the background to detect almost all E-mail attacks.
The proposed methodology, if implemented, can help protect E-mail users from
almost all kinds of unwanted mails with enhanced efficiency, reduced number of
false positives while not increasing the load on E-mail servers.

two papers [Ingebrigtsen et al., J. Chem. Phys. 135, 104101 (2011); ibid,
104102 (2011)], a numerical algorithm for simulating geodesic motion of atomic
systems was developed and tested against standard algorithms. The conclusion
was that the NVU algorithm has the same desirable properties as the Verlet
algorithm for Newtonian NVE dynamics, i.e., it is time-reversible and
symplectic. Additionally, it was concluded that NVU dynamics becomes equivalent
to NVE dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. In this paper, the NVU algorithm
for atomic systems is extended to be able to simulate geodesic motion of
molecules at constant potential energy. We derive an algorithm for simulating
rigid bonds and test this algorithm on three different systems: an asymmetric
dumbbell model, Lewis-Wahnstrom OTP, and rigid SPC/E water. The rigid bonds
introduce additional constraints beyond that of constant potential energy for
atomic systems. The rigid-bond NVU algorithm conserves potential energy, bond
lengths, and step length for indefinitely long runs. The quantities probed in
simulations give results identical to those of Nose-Hoover NVT dynamics. Since
Nose-Hoover NVT dynamics is known to give results equivalent to those of NVE
dynamics, the latter results show that NVU dynamics becomes equivalent to NVE
dynamics in the thermodynamic limit also for molecular systems.

asymmetry between the red and blue lobes of Stokes V increases from nearly zero
at the core of the structure to values close to unity at its edges (one-lobed

magnetic fields expanding with height, i.e., an expanding magnetic canopy
(which is required to fulfill pressure balance and flux conservation in the
solar atmosphere). Inversion of the Stokes I and V profiles of the patch
confirms this picture, revealing a decreasing field strength and increasing
height of the canopy base from the core to the periphery of the network patch.
However, the non-roundish shape of the structure and the presence of negative
area and amplitude asymmetries reveal that the scenario is more complex than a
canonical flux tube expanding with height surrounded by downflows.

appropriate survival strategies. Some of these generate water-vegetation
feedback mechanisms that can lead to spatial self-organisation of vegetation,
as it has been shown with models representing plants by a density of biomass,
varying continuously in time and space. However, although plants are usually
quite plastic they also display discrete qualities and stochastic behaviour.
These features may give rise to demographic noise, which in certain cases can
influence the qualitative dynamics of ecosystem models. In the present work we
explore the effects of demographic noise on the resilience of a model semi-arid
ecosystem. We introduce a spatial stochastic eco-hydrological hybrid model in
which plants are modelled as discrete entities subject to stochastic dynamical
rules, while the dynamics of surface and soil water are described by continuous
variables. The model has a deterministic approximation very similar to previous
continuous models of arid and semi-arid ecosystems. By means of numerical
simulations we show that demographic noise can have important effects on the
extinction and recovery dynamics of the system. In particular we find that the
stochastic model escapes extinction under a wide range of conditions for which
the corresponding deterministic approximation predicts absorption into desert
states.

one with silicon-based active layers and one based on scintillator strips that
are read out by MPPCs, allowing highly granular readout. The analog hadron
calorimeter is based on scintillating tiles that are also read out individually
by silicon photomultipliers. The multi-channel, auto-triggered front-end chips
are integrated into the active layers of the calorimeters and are designed for
minimal power consumption (power pulsing). The goal of the construction of
these prototypes is to demonstrate the feasibility of building and operating
detectors with fully integrated front-end electronics. The concept and

X-ray images and spectra are analyzed to search for traces of a recent star
formation event around HD93521 and to search for the signature of a possible
compact companion. Optical echelle spectra are analysed with plane-parallel
model atmosphere codes, assuming either a spherical star or a gravity darkened
rotationally flattened star, to infer the effective temperature and surface
gravity, and to derive the He, C, N and O abundances of HD93521. The X-ray
images reveal no traces of a population of young low-mass stars coeval with
HD93521. The X-ray spectrum of HD93521 is consistent with a normal late O-type
star although with subsolar metallicity. No trace of a compact companion is
found in the X-ray data. In the optical spectrum, He and N are found to be
overabundant, in line with the effect of rotational mixing in this very fast
rotator, whilst C and O are subsolar. A critical comparison with the properties
of subdwarf OB stars, indicates that, despite some apparent similarities,
HD93521 does not belong to this category. Despite some ambiguities on the
runaway status of the star, the most likely explanation is that HD93521 is a
Population I massive O-type star that was ejected from the Galactic plane

interactive applications, weather research and forecasting etc., in which the
data and applications are complex and distributed. In these applications secret
data should be shared, so secure data sharing mechanism is required in
Federated clouds to reduce the risk of data intrusion, the loss of service
availability and to ensure data integrity. So In this paper we have proposed
zero knowledge data sharing scheme where Trusted Cloud Authority (TCA) will
control federated clouds for data sharing where the secret to be exchanged for
computation is encrypted and retrieved by individual cloud at the end. Our
scheme is based on the difficulty of solving the Discrete Logarithm problem
(DLOG) in a finite abelian group of large prime order which is NP-Hard. So our
proposed scheme provides data integrity in transit, data availability when one
of host providers are not available during the computation.

IGM with the radio telescope LOFAR. The optical depth to the 21cm line has been
derived using simulations of reionization which include detailed radiative
transfer of ionizing photons. We find that the spectra from reionization models
with similar total comoving hydrogen ionizing emissivity but different
frequency distribution look remarkably similar. Thus, unless the reionization
histories are very different from each other (e.g. a predominance of UV vs.
x-ray heating) we do not expect to distinguish them by means of observations of
the 21cm forest. Because the presence of a strong x-ray background would make
the detection of 21cm line absorption impossible, the lack of absorption could
be used as a probe of the presence/intensity of the x-ray background and the
thermal history of the universe. Along a random line of sight LOFAR could
detect a global suppression of the spectrum from z>12, when the IGM is still
mostly neutral and cold, in contrast with the more well-defined, albeit broad,
absorption features visible at lower redshift. Sharp, strong absorption
features associated with rare, high density pockets of gas could be detected
also at z~7 along preferential lines of sight.

existing functional logic languages use such kind of rewrite systems to define
possibly non-strict non-deterministic functions. The semantics adopted for
non-determinism is call-time choice, whose combination with non-strictness is a
non trivial issue, addressed years ago from a semantic point of view with the
Constructor-based Rewriting Logic (CRWL), a well-known semantic framework
commonly accepted as suitable semantic basis of modern functional logic
languages. A drawback of CRWL is that it does not come with a proper notion of
one-step reduction, which would be very useful to understand and reason about
how computations proceed. In this paper we develop thoroughly the theory for
the first order version of let-rewriting, a simple reduction notion close to
that of classical term rewriting, but extended with a let-binding construction
to adequately express the combination of call-time choice with non-strict
semantics. Let-rewriting can be seen as a particular textual presentation of
term graph rewriting. We investigate the properties of let-rewriting, most
remarkably their equivalence with respect to a conservative extension of the
CRWL-semantics coping with let-bindings, and we show by some case studies that
having two interchangeable formal views (reduction/semantics) of the same
language is a powerful reasoning tool. After that, we provide a notion of
let-narrowing which is adequate for call-time choice as proved by soundness and
completeness results of let-narrowing with respect to let-rewriting. Moreover,

difficulty when developing such systems is the lack of a completely
satisfactory integration of logic and probability. We address this problem
directly. Expressive languages like higher-order logic are ideally suited for
representing and reasoning about structured knowledge. Uncertain knowledge can
be modeled by using graded probabilities rather than binary truth-values. The
main technical problem studied in this paper is the following: Given a set of
sentences, each having some probability of being true, what probability should
be ascribed to other (query) sentences? A natural wish-list, among others, is
that the probability distribution (i) is consistent with the knowledge base,
(ii) allows for a consistent inference procedure and in particular (iii)
reduces to deductive logic in the limit of probabilities being 0 and 1, (iv)
allows (Bayesian) inductive reasoning and (v) learning in the limit and in
particular (vi) allows confirmation of universally quantified
hypotheses/sentences. We translate this wish-list into technical requirements
for a prior probability and show that probabilities satisfying all our criteria
exist. We also give explicit constructions and several general
characterizations of probabilities that satisfy some or all of the criteria and
various (counter) examples. We also derive necessary and sufficient conditions
for extending beliefs about finitely many sentences to suitable probabilities
over all sentences, and in particular least dogmatic or least biased ones. We
conclude with a brief outlook on how the developed theory might be used and
approximated in autonomous reasoning agents. Our theory is a step towards a
globally consistent and empirically satisfactory unification of probability and
logic.

a stellar cluster. However, for clusters with velocity dispersions smaller than
a few km/s the observed radial velocity distribution tends to be dominated by
the orbital motions of binaries rather than the stellar motions through the
potential well of the cluster. Our goal is to characterize the intrinsic
velocity distribution of a cluster from a single epoch of radial velocity data,
even for a cluster with a velocity dispersion of a fraction of a km/s, using a
maximum likelihood procedure. Assuming a period, mass ratio, and eccentricity
distribution for the binaries in the observed cluster this procedure fits a
dynamical model describing the velocity distribution for the single stars and
center of masses of the binaries, simultaneously with the radial velocities
caused by binary orbital motions, using all the information available in the
observed velocity distribution. We find that the fits to the intrinsic velocity
distribution depend only weakly on the binary properties assumed, so the
uncertainty in the fitted parameters tends to be dominated by statistical
uncertainties. Based on Monte Carlo simulations we provide an estimate of how
these statistical uncertainties vary with the velocity dispersion, binary
fraction, and the number of observed stars, which can be used to estimate the
sample size needed to reach a specific accuracy. Finally we test the method on
the well-studied open cluster NGC 188, showing that it can reproduce a velocity
dispersion of only 0.5 km/s using a single epoch of the multi-epoch radial
velocity data. If the binary period, mass ratio, and eccentricity distribution
of the observed stars are roughly known, this procedure can be used to correct
for the effect of binary orbital motions on an observed velocity distribution.

optical path, from the beam combiners up to the reference points in the beam of
the primary telescope mirror, minimizing the systematic uncertainties and
providing a proper baseline in astrometric terms. Two laser beams with a fixed
phase relation travel backward the whole optical chain, creating a fringe
pattern in any plane close to a pupil. By temporal encoding the phase
information can be extracted at any point by means of flux measurements with
photo diodes. The reference points chosen sample the pupil at typical radii,
eliminating potential systematics due differential focus. We present the final

model for the stars and dust to the optical maps with the fitting algorithm
FitSKIRT. To account for the observed UV and mid-infrared emission, this
initial model was supplemented with both obscured and unobscured star-forming
regions. Even though these star-forming complexes provide an additional heating
source for the dust, the far-infrared/submillimeter emission long wards of 100
micron is underestimated by a factor of 3-4. This inconsistency in the dust
energy budget of NGC 4565 suggests that a sizable fraction (two-thirds) of the
total dust reservoir (Mdust ~ 2.9e+8 Msun) consists of a clumpy distribution
with no associated young stellar sources. The distribution of those dense dust
clouds would be in such a way that they remain unresolved in current

grouped at z = 0 in the Millennium dark matter cosmological simulation. The
determination of the cross to homogeneity in the Millennium Simulation data is
described from the behaviour of the fractal dimension and the lacunarity. We
use the sliding window technique to calculate the fractal mass-radius
dimension, the pre-factor F and the lacunarity of this fractal relation.
Besides, we determinate the multi-fractal dimension and the lacunarity
spectrum, including their dependence with radial distance. This calculations
show a radial distance dependency of all the fractal quantities, with
heterogeneity clustering of dark matter haloes up to depths of 100 Mpc/h. The
dark matter haloes clustering in the Millennium Simulation shows a radial
distance dependency, with two regions clearly defined. The lacunarity spectrum
for values of the structure parameter q >= 1 shows regions with relative
maxima, revealing the formation of clusters and voids in the dark matter haloes
distribution. With the use of the multi-fractal dimension and the lacunarity
spectrum, the transition to homogeneity at depths between 100 Mpc/h and 120
Mpc/h for the Millennium Simulation dark matter haloes is detected.

competition and random sampling. Understanding which of these processes is
dominating the collective evolutionary dynamics in dependence on system

quantitatively studied coevolutionary dynamics of competing species with a
focus on linearly frequency-dependent interactions, derived from a
game-theoretic viewpoint. However, several aspects of evolutionary dynamics,
e.g. limited resources, may induce effectively nonlinear frequency
dependencies. Here we study the impact of nonlinear frequency dependence on
evolutionary dynamics in a model class that covers linear frequency dependence
as a special case. We focus on the simplest non-trivial setting of two
genotypes and analyze the co-action of nonlinear frequency dependence with
asymmetric mutation rates. We find that their co-action may induce novel
metastable states as well as stochastic switching dynamics between them. Our
results reveal how the different mechanisms of mutation, selection and genetic
drift contribute to the dynamics and the emergence of metastable states,
suggesting that multistability is a generic feature in systems with
frequency-dependent fitness.

of this problem via Dynkin game, whose solution is given by the saddle point of
the cost function. The existence and uniqueness of the solution to this Dynkin
game are proved through an associated variational inequality problem involving
Dirichlet form. As a consequence, the properties of the value function of this
Dynkin game implies the smoothness of the value function of the stochastic

classical solution to this multi-dimensional singular control problem, which
was traditionally solved in the sense of viscosity solutions, and this enables
the application of the verification theorem to prove optimality.

done assuming that all the lines are split by the magnetic field according to
the Zeeman effect. However, a number of prominent spectral lines are produced
by closely spaced doublets or triplets. Such lines should be treated using the
theory of the partial Paschen-Back (PPB) effect. Depending on the strength and
orientation of magnetic field, the PPB effect can result in the Stokes IV
profiles of a spectral line that differ significantly from those predicted by
the Zeeman effect theory. It is important to understand the size and types of
errors that are introduced into magnetic spectrum synthesis by treating such
lines with the usual Zeeman splitting theory rather than using the correct
theoretical treatment of line splitting. To estimate the error introduced by
the use of the Zeeman approximation, numerical simulations have been performed
for spectral lines of the element silicon, for which a number of important
lines are actually in the PPB regime, assuming an oblique rotator model, for
various silicon abundances and Vsini values. A comparative analysis of the
Stokes IV profiles calculated assuming the PPB and Zeeman splitting has been
carried out for a number of both strong and weak SiII and SiIII lines. The
analysis indicates that for high precision studies of some spectral lines the
PPB approach should be used if the field strength at the magnetic poles is
Bp>10kG. In the case of the SiII line 5041A, the difference between the two
simulated profiles is caused by a significant contribution from a so called

quantitative variations in numerous traits in model organisms, including life
span, tumor susceptibility, learning and memory, sensitivity to alcohol and
anti-psychotic drugs, and two correlated traits poor reproductive fitness and
strong immunity. Similarly, in Europeans or European Americans, enrichment of
MAs of fast but not slow evolutionary rate was linked to autoimmune and
numerous other diseases, including type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease,

targets and measurements, is a fundamental problem in tracking. This paper
presents a graphical model formulation of data association and applies an
approximate inference method, belief propagation (BP), to obtain estimates of
marginal association probabilities. We prove that BP is guaranteed to converge,
and bound the number of iterations necessary. Experiments reveal a favourable
comparison to prior methods in terms of accuracy and computational complexity.
