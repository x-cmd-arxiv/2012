equipped with a representation of the groupoid of univalent conformal maps on
connected open sets of the Riemann sphere, and a family of linear functionals
on subalgebras, satisfying a set of properties including conformal invariance
and a type of restriction. This embodies some expected properties of
expectation values in conformal loop ensembles CLE. In the context of conformal
restriction systems, we study certain algebra elements associated with
hypotrochoid simple curves (including the ellipse). These have the CLE
interpretation of being ""renormalized random variables"" that are nonzero only
if there is at least one loop of hypotrochoid shape. Each curve has a center w,
a scale \epsilon\ and a rotation angle \theta, and we analyze the renormalized
random variable as a function of u=\epsilon e^{i\theta} and w. We find that it
has an expansion in positive powers of u and u*, and that the coefficients of
pure u (u*) powers are holomorphic in w (w*). We identify these coefficients
(the ""hypotrochoid fields"") with certain Virasoro descendants of the identity
field in conformal field theory, thereby showing that they form part of a
vertex operator algebraic structure. This largely generalizes works by the
author (in CLE), and the author with his collaborators V. Riva and J. Cardy (in
SLE 8/3 and other restriction measures), where the case of the ellipse, at the
order u^2, led to the stress-energy tensor of CFT. The derivation uses in an

particular the exact evaluation of CLE expectations of products of hypotrochoid

probe models where the NLSP decays, therefore probing supersymmetric breaking
scales below $5 \times 10^6$ GeV. The observatory field of view will be large
enough to detect a few tens of events per year, depending on its energy
threshold. This is complementary to a previous proposal (Albuquerque et al.,
2004) where it was shown that 1 Km$^3$ neutrino telescopes can directly probe
this scale. NLSPs will be produced by the interaction of high energy neutrinos
in the Earth. Here we investigate scenarios where they subsequently decay,
either in the atmosphere after escaping the Earth or right before leaving the
Earth, producing taus. These can be detected by JEM-EUSO and have two
distinctive signatures: one, they are produced in the Earth and go upwards in
the atmosphere, which allows discrimination from atmospheric taus and, second,
as NLSPs are always produced in pairs, coincident taus will be a strong
signature for these events. Assuming that the neutrino flux is equivalent to
the Waxman-Bahcall limit, we determine the rate of taus from NLSP decays
reaching JEM-EUSO's field of view.

We used simulated data generated by two different codes which use the same

integration techniques and use different models of stochastic wave excitation.
Acoustic travel times were measured from all data sets using the time-distance
helioseismology technique and compared with the ray theory predictions,
frequently used for helioseismic travel-time inversions. It is found that the
measured travel-time shifts agree well with the ray theory in both cases with
and without phase-speed filtering for the shallow and deep perturbations. This
testing verifies the whole measuring-filtering-inversion procedure for
sound-speed anomalies inside the Sun. It is shown, that the phase-speed
filtering, frequently used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio does not
introduce significant systematic errors. Results of the sound-speed inversion
procedure show good agreement with the background sound-speed profiles in all
cases. Due to its smoothing nature, the inversion procedure overestimates sound
speed variations in areas with sharp gradients of the sound-speed profile.

different relay strategies proposed by (Cover and El Gamal, 1979).
Individually, either of them has been successfully generalized to multi-relay
channels. In this paper, to allow each relay node the freedom of choosing
either of the two strategies, we propose a unified framework, where both the
D-F and C-F strategies can be employed simultaneously in the network. It turns
out that, to fully incorporate the advantages of both the best known D-F and
C-F strategies into a unified framework, the major challenge arises as follows:
For the D-F relay nodes to fully utilize the help of the C-F relay nodes,
decoding at the D-F relay nodes should not be conducted until all the blocks
have been finished; However, in the multi-level D-F strategy, the upstream
nodes have to decode prior to the downstream nodes in order to help, which
makes simultaneous decoding at all the D-F relay nodes after all the blocks
have been finished inapplicable. To tackle this problem, nested blocks combined
with backward decoding are used in our framework, so that the D-F relay nodes
at different levels can perform backward decoding at different frequencies. As
such, the upstream D-F relay nodes can decode before the downstream D-F relay
nodes, and the use of backward decoding at each D-F relay node ensures the full
exploitation of the help of both the other D-F relay nodes and the C-F relay
nodes. The achievable rates under our unified relay framework are found to
combine both the best known D-F and C-F achievable rates and include them as
special cases.

measured with fMRI (functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging), display a rich and
neurobiologically relevant functional connectivity structure. This structure is
usually revealed using time averaging methods, which prevent the detection of
functional connectivity changes over time. In this work we studied the
electrophysiological correlates of dynamical BOLD functional connectivity
fluctuations, by means of long (approx. 50 min) joint electroencephalographic
(EEG) and fMRI recordings. We identified widespread positive and negative
correlations between EEG spectral power and fMRI BOLD connectivity fluctuations
in a network of 90 cortical and subcortical regions. In particular, increased
alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) power were related to decreased functional
connectivity, whereas gamma (30-60 Hz) power correlated positively with BOLD
connectivity between specific brain regions. Furthermore, these patterns were
altered for subjects undergoing vigilance changes, with an involvement of the
slow delta (0.4 - 4 Hz) band in localized positive correlations. Finally, graph
theoretical indices of network structure also exhibited sharp changes over
time, with average path length correlating positively with alpha power
extracted from central and frontal electrodes. Our results strongly suggest
that non-stationary BOLD functional connectivity has a neurophysiological
origin. Positive correlations of BOLD connectivity with gamma can be
interpreted as increased average binding over relatively long periods of time,
possibly due to spontaneous cognition occurring during rest. Negative
correlations with alpha suggest functional inhibition of local and long-range
connectivity, associated with an idling state of the brain.

with gamma-dependent symplectic structure and more generally in agreement with
the phase space underlying Loop Quantum Gravity restricted to a single graph -
a.k.a. Twisted Geometries. The second, fuller reduction leads to a
gamma-independent symplectic structure on the phase space of

despite the discrete nature of the (rare) bright quasars that dominate the
background. We implement a cosmological radiative transfer model that includes
the most recent constraints on the ionizing spectra and luminosity function of
quasars and the distribution of IGM absorbers. We also estimate, for the first
time, the effects of fluctuations on the evolving continuum opacity in two
ways: by incorporating the complete distribution of ionizing background
amplitudes into the standard approach, and by explicitly treating the quasars
as discrete -- but isolated -- sources. Our model results in a He II ionization
rate that evolves steeply with redshift, increasing by a factor ~2 from z=3.0
to z=2.5. This causes rapid evolution in the mean He II Ly{\alpha} optical
depth -- as recently observed -- without appealing to the reionization of He
II. The observed behaviour could instead result from rapid evolution in the
mean free path of ionizing photons as the helium in higher H I column density
absorbers becomes fully ionized.

activity on the infrared (0.3-1000 microns) spectral energy distributions of
luminous infrared galaxies from z = 0.5 to 4.0. We have compiled a large sample
of 151 galaxies selected at 24 microns (S24 > 100 uJy) in the GOODS-N and ECDFS
fields for which we have deep Spitzer IRS spectroscopy, allowing us to
decompose the mid-IR spectrum into contributions from star formation and AGN
activity. A significant portion (~25%) of our sample is dominated by an AGN in
the mid-IR. Based on the mid-IR classification, we divide our full sample into
four sub-samples: z~1 star-forming (SF) sources; z~2 SF sources; AGN with clear
9.7 micron silicate absorption; and AGN with featureless mid-IR spectra. From
our large spectroscopic sample and wealth of multi-wavelength data, including
deep Herschel imaging at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 microns, we use 95
galaxies with complete spectral coverage to create a composite spectral energy
distribution (SED) for each sub-sample. We then fit a two-temperature component
modified blackbody to the SEDs. We find that the IR SEDs have similar cold dust
temperatures, regardless of the mid-IR power source, but display a marked
difference in the warmer dust temperatures. We calculate the average effective
temperature of the dust in each sub-sample and find a significant (~20 K)
difference between the SF and AGN systems. We compare our composite SEDs to
local templates and find that local templates do not accurately reproduce the
mid-IR features and dust temperatures of our high redshift systems. High
redshift IR luminous galaxies contain significantly more cool dust than their
local counterparts. We find that a full suite of photometry spanning the IR
peak is necessary to accurately account for the dominant dust temperature
components in high redshift IR luminous galaxies.

1<z<2, using near-UV spectroscopy of FeII and MgII absorption and emission. The
average blueshift of the FeII interstellar absorption lines with respect to the
systemic velocity is -85+/-10 km/s at z~1.5, with standard deviation 87 km/s;
this is a decrease of a factor of two from the average blueshift measured for
far-UV interstellar absorption lines in similarly selected galaxies at z~2. The
profiles of the MgII 2796, 2803 lines show much more variety than the FeII
profiles, which are always seen in absorption; MgII ranges from strong emission
to pure absorption, with emission more common in galaxies with blue UV slopes
and at lower stellar masses. Outflow velocities, as traced by the centroids and
maximum extent of the absorption lines, increase with increasing stellar mass
with 2-3sigma significance, in agreement with previous results. We study fine
structure emission from FeII*, finding several lines of evidence in support of
the model in which this emission is generated by the re-emission of continuum
photons absorbed in the FeII resonance transitions in outflowing gas. In
contrast, photoionization models indicate that MgII emission arises from the
resonant scattering of photons produced in HII regions, accounting for the
differing profiles of the MgII and FeII lines. A comparison of the strengths of
the FeII absorption and FeII* emission lines indicates that massive galaxies
have more extended outflows and/or greater extinction, while two-dimensional
composite spectra indicate that emission from the outflow is stronger at a
radius of ~10 kpc in high mass galaxies than in low mass galaxies.

dedicated to the detection of B-mode polarization fluctuations in the Cosmic
Microwave Background. Aims. We introduce a self-calibration procedure related
to those used in radio-interferometry to control a large range of instrumental
systematic errors in polarization-sensitive instruments. Methods. This
procedure takes advantage of the fact that in the absence of systematic
effects, measurements on redundant baselines should exactly match each other.
For a given systematic error model, measuring each baseline independently
therefore allows to write a system of nonlinear equations whose unknowns are
the systematic error model parameters (gains and couplings of Jones matrices
for instance). Results. We give the mathematical basis of the self-calibration.
We implement this method numerically in the context of bolometric
interferometry. We show that, for large enough arrays of horns, the nonlinear
system can be solved numerically using a standard nonlinear least-squares
fitting and that the accuracy achievable on systematic effects is only limited
by the time spent on the calibration mode for each baseline apart from the
validity of the systematic error model.

discuss the relationship between points of E_8 and superpotential zeroes and
give sufficient conditions for such a point to cause a zero, even for an SU(5)

Maclaurin inventions on Calculus and their remarkable role in the early mid
1700s; next we focus a bit on his evaluation, 1742, of the hyperbolic excess,
explaining the true motivation behind his research. To his
geometrical-analytical treatment we attach ours, a purely analytical
alternative. Our hyperbola inquiry is then switched to John Landen, an amateur
mathematician, who probably was writing more to fix his priorities than to
explain his remarkable findings. We follow him in the obscure proofs of his
theorem on hyperbola rectification, explaining the links to Maclaurin and so
on. With a chain of geometrical constructions, we attach our interpretation to
Landen's treatment. Our modern analytical proof to his hyperbolic limit excess,
by means of elliptic integrals of the first and second kind is also provided,
and we demonstrate why the so called Landen transformation for the elliptic
integrals cannot be ascribed to him. Next, the subject leaves England for the
Continent: the character of Lagrange is introduced, even if our interest
concerns only his 1785 memoir on irrational integrals, where the Arithmetic
Geometric Mean, AGM, is established by him. Nevertheless, our objective is not
the AGM, but to detect the real source of the so-called Landen transformation
for elliptic integrals. In fact, Lagrange's paper encloses a differential
identity stemming from the AGM: integrating it, we show how it could be
possible to arrive at the well-known Legendre recursive computation of a first
kind elliptic integral, which appeared in his Trait\'e, 1827, much after the
Lagrange's paper.

has been observed near an {\it atom-dimer resonance}, at which there is an
Efimov trimer at the atom-dimer threshold. The conventional interpretation of
these loss features is that they are produced by the {\it avalanche mechanism},
in which the energetic atom and dimer from 3-body recombination undergo
secondary elastic collisions that produce additional atoms with sufficient
energy to escape from the trapping potential. We use Monte Carlo methods to
calculate the average number of atoms lost and the average heat generated by
recombination events in a Bose-Einstein condensate and in a thermal gas. We
improve on previous models by taking into account the energy-dependence of the
cross sections, the spacial structure of the atom cloud, and the elastic
scattering of the atoms. We show that the avalanche mechanism cannot produce a
narrow loss feature near the atom-dimer resonance. The number of atoms lost
from a recombination event can be more than twice as large as the 3 that would
be obtained in the absence of secondary collisions. However the resulting loss
feature is broad and its peak is at a scattering length that is larger than the
atom-dimer resonance and depends on the trap depth.

collimation of relativistic jets in the presence of gravity. This method is
self-similar throughout the computational domain where gravitational effects
are negligible and, where significant, self-similar within a flux tube. These
solutions are applicable to jets launched from a small region (e.g., near the
inner edge of an accretion disk). As implied by earlier work, the flow can
converge onto the rotation axis, potentially creating a collimation shock.
  In this first version of the method, we derive the gravitational contribution
to the relativistic equations by analogy with non-relativistic flow. This
approach captures the relativistic kinetic gravitational mass of the flowing
plasma, but not that due to internal thermal and magnetic energies. A more
sophisticated treatment, derived from the basic general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamical equations, is currently being developed.
  Here we present an initial exploration of parameter space, describing the
effects the model parameters have on flow solutions and the location of the
collimation shock. These results provide the groundwork for new, semi-analytic
models of relativistic jets which can constrain conditions near the black hole

(anti)proton beam pulse train. This waveform is played out for any one or all
three bunch trains in the Tevatron. The programmed waveform voltages transition
to different levels at time intervals corresponding to the 395 ns bunch
spacing. Thus, complex voltage waveforms can be played out at a sustained rate
of 143 kHz over the full 6 kV output range. This paper describes the novel
design of the inductive adder topology employing five transformers. It
describes the design aspects that minimize switching losses for this
multi-kilovolt, high repetition rate and high duty factor application.

number. We also investigate cases with varying angles between the angular
velocity and gravity vectors, corresponding to locating the computational
domain at different latitudes ranging from the pole to the equator of the star.
We perform three-dimensional numerical simulations in the same parameter

calibrated by two fitting methods using simulation data. Unique determination
of the closure parameters is possible only in the non-rotating case or when the
system is placed at the pole. In the other cases the fit procedures yield
somewhat differing results. The quality of the closure is tested by
substituting the resulting coefficients back into the closure model and
comparing with the simulation results. To eliminate the possibilities that the
results obtained depend on the aspect ratio of the simulation domain or suffer
from too small Rayleigh numbers we performed runs varying these parameters. The
simulation data for the Reynolds stress and heat fluxes broadly agree with
previous compressible simulations. The closure works fairly well with slow and
fast rotation but its quality degrades for intermediate rotation rates. We find
that the closure parameters depend not only on rotation rate but also on
latitude. The weak dependence on Rayleigh number and the aspect ratio of the
domain indicates that our results are generally valid

infinite-dimensional group $\mathbb{GLB}$ of almost upper-triangular infinite
matrices over the finite field with $q$ elements. This group was defined by
S.K., A.V., and Andrei Zelevinsky in 1982 as an adequate $n=\infty$ analogue of
general linear groups $\mathbb{GL}(n,q)$. It serves as an alternative to
$\mathbb{GL}(\infty,q)$, whose representation theory is poor.
  Our most important results are the description of semi-finite unipotent
traces (characters) of the group $\mathbb{ GLB}$ via certain probability
measures on the Borel subgroup $\mathbb{B}$ and the construction of the
corresponding von Neumann factor representations of type $II_\infty$.
  As a main tool we use the subalgebra $\mathcal A(\mathbb{ GLB})$ of smooth
functions in the group algebra $L_1(\mathbb{GLB})$. This subalgebra is an
inductive limit of the finite--dimensional group algebras ${\mathbb
C}(\mathbb{GL}(n,q))$ under parabolic embeddings.
  As in other examples of the asymptotic representation theory we discover
remarkable properties of the infinite case which does not take place for finite
groups, like multiplicativity of indecomposable characters or connections to
probabilistic concepts.
  The infinite dimensional Iwahori-Hecke algebra $\mathcal H_q(\infty)$ plays a
special role in our considerations and allows to understand the deep analogy of
the developed theory with the representation theory of infinite symmetric group
$S(\infty)$ which had been intensively studied in numerous previous papers.

of being true object members. We then re-test our modified algorithm using
random-realization artificial data to verify the validity of the generated
posterior probability distributions (PPDs) and proceed to apply the algorithm
to the satellite system of M31, culminating in a 3D view of the system. Further
to the distributions thus obtained, we apply a satellite-specific prior on the
satellite distances to weight the resulting distance posterior distributions,
based on the halo density profile. Thus in a single publication, using a single
method, a comprehensive coverage of the distances to the companion galaxies of
M31 is presented, encompassing the dwarf spheroidals Andromedas I - III, V,

investigated in the context of low luminosity AGN (LLAGN). We generalize the
disk evaporation model used in the interpretative framework of black hole X-ray
binaries by including the effect of a magnetic field in accretion disks
surrounding supermassive black holes. The critical transition mass accretion
rate for which the disk is truncated is found to be insensitive to magnetic
effects, but its inclusion leads to a smaller truncation radius in comparison
to a model without its consideration. That is, a thin viscous disk is truncated
for LLAGN at an Eddington ratio less than 0.03 for a standard viscosity
parameter ($\alpha = 0.3$). An increase of the viscosity parameter results in a
higher critical transition mass accretion rate and a correspondingly smaller
truncation distance, the latter accentuated by greater magnetic energy
densities in the disk. Based on these results, the truncation radii inferred
from spectral fits of LLAGN published in the literature are consistent with the
disk evaporation model. The infrared emission arising from the truncated
geometrically thin accretion disks may be responsible for the red bump seen in
such LLAGN.

evolve rapidly. In most animals and plants that have been studied, centromeres
contain megabase-scale arrays of tandem repeats. Despite their importance, very
little is known about the degree to which centromere tandem repeats share
common properties between different species across different phyla. We used
bioinformatic methods to identify high-copy tandem repeats from 282 species
using publicly available genomic sequence and our own data. The assumption that
the most abundant tandem repeat is the centromere DNA was true for most species
whose centromeres have been previously characterized, suggesting this is a
general property of genomes. Our methods are compatible with all current
sequencing technologies. Long Pacific Biosciences sequence reads allowed us to
find tandem repeat monomers up to 1,419 bp. High-copy centromere tandem repeats
were found in almost all animal and plant genomes, but repeat monomers were
highly variable in sequence composition and in length. Furthermore,
phylogenetic analysis of sequence homology showed little evidence of sequence
conservation beyond ~50 million years of divergence. We find that despite an
overall lack of sequence conservation, centromere tandem repeats from diverse
species showed similar modes of evolution, including the appearance of higher
order repeat structures in which several polymorphic monomers make up a larger
repeating unit. While centromere position in most eukaryotes is epigenetically
determined, our results indicate that tandem repeats are highly prevalent at
centromeres of both animals and plants. This suggests a functional role for
such repeats, perhaps in promoting concerted evolution of centromere DNA across
chromosomes.

Generation (4G). The 4G wireless network is intended to complement and replace
the current generations. Accessing information anywhere, anytime, with a
seamless connection to a wide range of information and services, and receiving
a large volume of information, data, pictures, video, and so on, are the keys
features of 4G. Based on the developing trends of mobile communication, 4G will
have broader bandwidth, higher data rate, and smoother and quicker handoff to
provide seamless service across a multitude of wireless systems and networks.
One of the major issues of seamless mobility is handoff management. It is a
major challenge to design intelligent handoff management schemes for
4G-systems. In this paper we have presented the design of an adaptive
multi-attribute vertical handoff decision algorithm based on genetic algorithm
which is both cost effective and useful.

a context of massive data, one would like to minimize both the amount of

the connection between Boltzmann equation and the Navier-Stokes equations. This
connection allows us to construct a flux splitting for the Navier-Stokes
equations based on the direction of molecular motion from which a numerical
flux can be obtained. The naive use of such a numerical flux function in a
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization leads to an unstable scheme in the
viscous dominated case. Stable schemes are constructed by adding additional
terms either in a symmetric or non-symmetric manner which are motivated by the
DG schemes for elliptic equations. The novelty of the present scheme is the use
of kinetic fluxes to construct the stabilization terms. In the symmetric case,
interior penalty terms have to be added for stability and the resulting schemes
give optimal convergence rates in numerical experiments. The non-symmetric
schemes lead to a cell energy/entropy inequality but exhibit sub-optimal
convergence rates. These properties are studied by applying the schemes to a
scalar convection-diffusion equation and the 1-D compressible Navier-Stokes
equations. In the case of Navier-Stokes equations, entropy variables are used
to construct stable schemes.

which preserve kinetic energy in the semi-discrete finite volume scheme. The
essential feature is that the momentum flux should be of the form $f^m_\jph =
\tp_\jph + \avg{u}_\jph f^\rho_\jph$ where $\avg{u}_\jph = (u_j + u_{j+1})/2$
and $\tp_\jph, f^\rho_\jph$ are {\em any} consistent approximations to the
pressure and the mass flux. This scheme thus leaves most terms in the numerical
flux unspecified and various authors have used simple averaging. Here we
enforce approximate or exact entropy consistency which leads to a unique choice
of all the terms in the numerical fluxes. As a consequence novel entropy
conservative flux that also preserves kinetic energy for the semi-discrete
finite volume scheme has been proposed. These fluxes are centered and some
dissipation has to be added if shocks are present or if the mesh is coarse. We
construct scalar artificial dissipation terms which are kinetic energy stable
and satisfy approximate/exact entropy condition. Secondly, we use entropy-
variable based matrix dissipation flux which leads to kinetic energy and
entropy stable schemes. These schemes are shown to be free of entropy violating
solutions unlike the original Roe scheme. For hypersonic flows a blended scheme
is proposed which gives carbuncle free solutions for blunt body flows.

model quantum dot with intermediate coupling to the leads, i.e., with tunnel
coupling of the order of the thermal energy k_B T. The coupling is large enough
that sequential tunneling processes alone do not suffice to properly describe
the transport characteristics. Upon applying a density matrix approach, the
current is expressed in terms of rates obtained by considering a very small
class of diagrams which dress the sequential tunneling processes by charge
fluctuations. We call this the ""dressed second order"" (DSO) approximation. One
major achievement of the DSO is that, still in the Coulomb blockade regime, it
can describe the crossover from thermally broadened to tunneling broadened
conductance peaks. When the temperature is decreased even further, the DSO
captures ""Kondesque"" behaviours of the Anderson quantum dot qualitatively: We
find a zero bias anomaly of the differential conductance versus applied bias,
an enhancement of the conductance with decreasing temperature as well as the
onset of universality of the shape of the conductance as function of the
temperature. We can address the case of a spin-degenerate level split
energetically by a magnetic field and show that, if we assume in addition
different capacitive couplings of the two spin-levels to the leads, one of the
resonance peaks is vanishing. In case spin-dependent chemical potentials are
introduced and only one of the four is varied, the DSO yields in principle only
one resonance. This seems to be in agreement with experiments with pseudo-spin.
Furthermore, we get qualitative agreement with experimental data showing a
cross-over from the Kondo to the empty orbital regime.

  Power Networks","7 pages; 2 figures",,,,"nlin.CD math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the total resistive losses incurred in returning a power
network of identical generators to a synchronous state following a transient
stability event or in maintaining this state in the presence of persistent
stochastic disturbances. We formulate this cost as the input-output $H^2$ norm
of a linear dynamical system with distributed disturbances. We derive an
expression for the total resistive losses that scales with the size of the
network as well as properties of the generators and power lines, but is
independent of the network topology. This topologically invariant scaling of
what we term the price of synchrony is in contrast to typical power system
stability notions like rate of convergence or the region of attraction for
rotor-angle stability. Our result indicates that highly connected power
networks, whilst desirable for higher phase synchrony, do not offer an
advantage in terms of the total resistive power losses needed to achieve this
synchrony. Furthermore, if power flow is the mechanism used to achieve
synchrony in highly-distributed-generation networks, the cost increases
unboundedly with the number of generators.
