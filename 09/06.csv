for the origin of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) have gotten increasingly tight. The
only type of non-degenerate stars that survive the limits on the companions of
SNIa in SNR 0509-67.5 and SN1572 are M dwarfs. M dwarfs have special properties
that have not been considered in most work on the progenitors of SNIa: they
have small but finite magnetic fields, and they flare frequently. These
properties are explored in the context of SNIa progenitors. White dwarf/M dwarf
pairs may be sufficiently plentiful to provide an adequate rate of explosions.
Even modest magnetic fields on the white dwarf and M dwarf will yield adequate
torques to lock the two stars together, resulting in a slowly rotating white
dwarf, with the magnetic poles pointing at one another in the orbital plane.
The mass loss will be channeled by a ""magnetic bottle"" connecting the two
stars, landing on a concentrated polar area on the white dwarf. This enhances
the effective rate of accretion compared to spherical accretion. Luminosity
from accretion and hydrogen burning on the surface of the white dwarf may
induce self-excited mass transfer. The combined effects of self-excited mass
loss, polar accretion, and magnetic inhibition of mixing of accretion layers
give possible means to beat the ""nova limit"" and grow the white dwarf to the
Chandrasekhar mass even at rather moderate mass accretion rates.

this study is to identify oxygen-rich stars in IC 10 and to constrain their
nature between asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs), red supergiants (RSGs),
and other infrared bright sources. We examine the mass-loss rate of the stars
and compare to results obtained for the Magellanic Clouds. Our objectives are
to (1) assess whether RSGs can be significant dust producers in IC 10, and (2),
solve the discrepancy between the star formation history of IC 10 and the
relatively low number of RSGs detected in the optical. We search for silicate
dust in emission by using the spectral map observed with the Infrared
Spectrograph on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. The optical (UBVRI) and
infrared (JHK, Spitzer/IRAC and Spitzer/MIPS) photometry is used to assert the
membership of the stars to IC 10 and disentangle between AGBs and RSGs.
Radiative models are used to infer mass-loss rates and stellar luminosities.
The luminosity and colors of at least 9 silicate emission sources are
consistent with stars within IC 10. Furthermore, the photometry of 2 of these
sources is consistent with RSGs. We derive dust mass-loss rates similar to the
values found in the Magellanic Clouds. Accounting for the sample completeness,
RSGs are not important contributors to the dust mass budget in IC 10.

scales from less than one minute to nearly an hour. The observations sample
nearly all times of day and all seasons. They also span latitudes and
longitudes from 28 deg. N to 40 deg. N and 95 deg. W to 114 deg. W,
respectively. We have binned and averaged the fluctuation spectra according to
time of day, season, and geomagnetic (Kp index) and solar (F10.7) activity.
These spectra provide a detailed, multi-scale account of seasonal and intraday
variations in ionospheric activity with wavelike structures detected at
wavelengths between about 35 and 250 km. In some cases, trends between spectral
power and Kp index and/or F10.7 are also apparent. In addition, the VLSS
observations allow for measurements of the turbulent power spectrum down to
periods of 40 seconds (scales of ~0.4 km at the height of the E-region). While
the level of turbulent activity does not appear to have a strong dependence on
either Kp index or F10.7, it does appear to be more pronounced during the
winter daytime, summer nighttime, and near dusk during the spring.

complements with a given volume v can grow at least factorially fast with v. A
similar statement holds for closed hyperbolic 3-manifolds, obtained via Dehn
surgery. Furthermore, we give explicit estimates for lower bounds of N(v) in
terms of v for these examples. These results improve upon the work of Hodgson
and Masai, which describes examples that grow exponentially fast with v. Our
constructions rely on performing volume preserving mutations along Conway
spheres and on the classification of Montesinos knots.

and cosmic shear survey will be able to constrain the absolute neutrino mass
scale. Adopting conservative assumptions about the survey specifications and
assuming complete ignorance of the galaxy bias, we estimate that the minimum
mass sum of sum m_nu ~ 0.06 eV in the normal hierarchy can be detected at 1.5
sigma to 2.5 sigma significance, depending on the model complexity, using a
combination of galaxy and cosmic shear power spectrum measurements in
conjunction with CMB temperature and polarisation observations from Planck.
With better knowledge of the galaxy bias, the significance of the detection
could potentially reach 5.4 sigma. Interestingly, neither Planck+shear nor
Planck+galaxy alone can achieve this level of sensitivity; it is the combined
effect of galaxy and cosmic shear power spectrum measurements that breaks the
persistent degeneracies between the neutrino mass, the physical matter density,
and the Hubble parameter. Notwithstanding this remarkable sensitivity to sum
m_nu, Euclid-like shear and galaxy data will not be sensitive to the exact mass
spectrum of the neutrino sector; no significant bias (< 1 sigma) in the
parameter estimation is induced by fitting inaccurate models of the neutrino
mass splittings to the mock data, nor does the goodness-of-fit of these models
suffer any significant degradation relative to the true one (Delta chi_eff ^2<
1).

taking near horizon limits of certain intersecting solutions (F-string with
D$p$-branes and also with two D-branes) of string theory. In this paper we
construct intersecting bound state solutions in the form of NS5-D$p$-branes

threshold bound states unlike the known NS5-D$p$ bound states which are 1/2 BPS

lead to Lifshitz-like space-time with the dynamical scaling exponent $z=0$ and
the hyperscaling violation exponent $\theta=9-p$. The spatial dimension of the
boundary theory is $d=7-p$. The dilatons in these theories are not constant in
general (except for $p=5$) and therefore produce RG flows. So, we also consider
the strong coupling phases of these theories and find that these phases also
have similar Lifshitz-like structures, except for $p=2$, where it has an

as a basis upon which the in-medium spectral functions can be constructed. A

to include excited resonances, dictated by satisfying the Weinberg-type sum
rules. This includes excited states in both the vector and axial-vector

function are presented. Based on a rho spectral function tested in dilepton

searching for a given number in a given set of numbers. Other than sequential
search, the classic solution is to sort the list of numbers and then apply
binary search. The binary search problem has a complexity of O(logN) for a list
of N numbers while the sorting problem cannot be better than O(N) on any
sequential computer following the usual assumptions. Whenever the problem of
deciding partial order can be done in O(1), a variation of the problem on some
bounded list of numbers is to apply binary search without resorting to sort.
The overall complexity of the problem is then O(log R) for some radius R. A
logarithmic upper-bound for finite encodings is shown. Also, the topology of
orderings can provide efficient algorithms for search problems in combinatorial
spaces. The main characteristic of those spaces is that they have typical
exponential space complexities. The factorial case describes an order topology
that can be illustrated using the combinatorial polytope . When a known order
topology can be combined to a given formulation of a search problem, the
resulting search problem has a polylogarithmic complexity. This logarithmic
complexity can then become useful in combinatorial search by providing a
logarithmic break-down. These algorithms can be termed as the class of search
algorithms that do not require read and are equivalent to the class of
logarithmically recursive functions. Also, the notion of order invariance is

signal and a zero-mean white Gaussian noise with an unknown variance. The
signal is composed of large- and small-magnitude components identified by
binary state variables whose probabilistic dependence structure is described by
a Markov tree. Gaussian priors are assigned to the signal coefficients given
their state variables and the Jeffreys' noninformative prior is assigned to the
noise variance. Our signal reconstruction scheme is based on an EM iteration
that aims at maximizing the posterior distribution of the signal and its state
variables given the noise variance. We construct the missing data for the EM
iteration so that the complete-data posterior distribution corresponds to a
hidden Markov tree (HMT) probabilistic graphical model that contains no loops
and implement its maximization (M) step via a max-product algorithm. This EM
algorithm estimates the vector of state variables as well as solves iteratively
a linear system of equations to obtain the corresponding signal estimate. We
select the noise variance so that the corresponding estimated signal and state
variables obtained upon convergence of the EM iteration have the largest
marginal posterior distribution. We compare the proposed and existing
state-of-the-art reconstruction methods via signal and image reconstruction
experiments.

pore structure of sandy soils, we introduce a custom pressure plate method in
which the volume of water expelled from a wet granular packing is measured as a
function of applied pressure. Using a capillary bundle model, we show that the
differential change in retained water per pressure increment is directly
related to the cumulative cross-sectional area distribution $f(r)$ of the
water-accessible pores with radii less than $r$. This is validated by
measurements of water expelled from a model sandy soil composed of 2 mm
diameter glass beads. In particular, the expelled water is found to depend
dramatically on sample height and that analysis using the capillary bundle
model gives the same pore size distribution for all samples. The distribution
is found to be approximately log-normal, and the total cross-sectional area
fraction of the accessible pore space is found to be $f_0=0.34$. We then report
on how the pore distribution and total water-accessible area fraction are
affected by superabsorbent hydrogel particle additives, uniformly mixed into a
fixed-height sample at varying concentrations. Under both fixed volume and free
swelling conditions, the total area fraction of water-accessible pore space in
a packing decreases exponentially as the gel concentration increases. The size
distribution of the pores is significantly modified by the swollen hydrogel
particles, such that large pores are clogged while small pores are formed.

of direct quantum simulations and via semiclassical analysis of the evolution
of Wigner function. We demonstrate then that the period of oscillations is
correctly reproduced by a hydrodynamic theory with an appropriate dispersive

interaction on the phenomenon. We show that sufficiently strong interaction
[$U(r)\gg 1/mr^2$ where $m$ is the fermionic mass and $r$ the relevant spatial

active investigation. This is not limited to subatomic structures but extends
to the macroscopic level. Nonlocal interactions can be from either entanglement
or path indistinguishability (the path integral for larger systems), with the
latter being further subdivided as discussed. These two distinct phenomenon
have recently been treated often in the literature as essentially identical,
which is problematic when utilizing them for practical applications. The
confusion may lie in misunderstanding the physics of the type II spontaneous
parameteric downconversion source (SPDS), which is used extensively with
entanglement studies. This paper examines the distinction, and why it is
important for practical applications, between quantum correlations from path
indistinguishability versus entanglement. The path indistinguishability
approaches discussed, under ambient conditions, are performed with a thermal
source or, a coherent source (single photon wavepacket) when local
entanglements in both arm have specific characteristics. The latter we will
show has the property that it can surprisingly lead to coherence expansion
rather than decoherence under the proper conditions. Nonlocal quantum
correlations are a complex topic that extends beyond quantum entanglement.

a primitive ideal in the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie
algebra. The first one, very classical, is the Goldie rank of an ideal. The
second one is the dimension of an irreducible module corresponding to this
ideal over an appropriate finite W-algebra. We concentrate on the integral
central character case. We prove, modulo a conjecture, that in this case the
two are equal. Also, modulo the same conjecture, we compute certain scale
factors introduced by Joseph. Our conjecture asserts that there is a
one-dimensional module over the W-algebra with certain additional properties.
The conjecture is proved for the classical types. This completes a program of
computing Goldie ranks proposed by Joseph in the 80's.
  We also provide an essentially Kazhdan-Lusztig type formula for computing the
characters of the irreducibles in the Brundan-Goodwin-Kleshchev category O for
a W-algebra again under the assumption that the central character is integral.
The formula is based on a certain functor (a generalized Soegel functor) from
an appropriate parabolic category O to the W-algebra category O. We prove a
number of properties of this functor including the quotient property and the
double centralizer property.
  We develop several topics related to our generalized Soergel functor. For
example, we discuss its analog for the category of Harish-Chandra bimodules. We
also discuss generalizations to the case of categories O over Dixmier algebras.
The most interesting example of this situation comes from the theory of quantum
groups: we prove that an algebra that is basically Luszitg's form of a quantum
group at a root of unity is a Dixmier algebra. For this we check that the
quantum Frobenius epimorphism splits.

ionized and a dark molecular region. They consist of neutral gas which
interacts with far-ultraviolet radiation and are characterized by strong
infrared line emission. Various numerical codes treating one-dimensional PDRs
have been developed in the past, simulating the complexity of chemical
reactions occurring and providing a better understanding of the structure of a
PDR. In this paper we present the three-dimensional code, 3D-PDR, which can
treat PDRs of arbitrary density distribution. The code solves the chemistry and
the thermal balance self-consistently within a given three-dimensional cloud.
It calculates the total heating and cooling functions at any point in a given
PDR by adopting an escape probability method. It uses a HEALPix-based
ray-tracing scheme to evaluate the attenuation of the far-ultraviolet radiation
in the PDR and the propagation of the far-infrared/submm line emission out of
the PDR. We present benchmarking results and apply 3D-PDR to i) a
uniform-density spherical cloud interacting with a plane-parallel external
radiation field, ii) a uniform-density spherical cloud interacting with a
two-component external radiation field, and iii) a cometary globule interacting
with a plane-parallel external radiation field. We find that the code is able
to reproduce the benchmarking results of various other one-dimensional
numerical codes treating PDRs. We also find that the accurate treatment of the
radiation field in the fully three-dimensional treatment of PDRs can in some
cases leads to different results when compared to a standard one-dimensional
treatment.

from integrated-light high-dispersion spectra of star clusters. As a pilot
project, we measure abundances of several elements for three globular clusters
(GCs) in the Fornax dSph, using VLT/UVES spectra. Methods: We divide the
cluster colour-magnitude diagrams into about 100 bins and compute synthetic
spectra for each bin. The individual model spectra are co-added and the
abundances are iteratively adjusted until the best match to the observed
spectra is achieved. Results: We find [Fe/H] = -2.3, -1.4 and -2.1 for Fornax
3, 4 and 5, with +/-0.1 dex uncertainties. Fornax 3 and 5 are thus similar in
metallicity to the most metal-poor Milky Way GCs and fall near the extreme
metal-poor end of the field star metallicity distribution in Fornax. The
[alpha/Fe] ratios, as traced by Ca and Ti, are enhanced with respect to the
Solar composition at the level of about +0.25 dex for Fornax 3 and 5, and
possibly slightly less (about +0.12 dex) for Fornax 4. For all three clusters
the [Mg/Fe] ratio is significantly less elevated than [Ca/Fe] and [Ti/Fe],
possibly an effect of the abundance anomalies that are well-known in Galactic
GCs. We thus confirm that Mg may be a poor proxy for the overall alpha-element
abundances for GCs. The abundance patterns of heavy elements (Y, Ba and Eu)
indicate a dominant contribution to nucleosynthesis from the r-process in all
three clusters, with a mean [Ba/Eu]=-0.7, suggesting rapid formation of the
GCs. Conclusions: Combining our results with literature data for Fornax 1 and
2, four of the five Fornax GCs fall in the range -2.5<[Fe/H]<-2, while Fornax 4
is substantially more metal-rich than the others. The indications that
abundance anomalies are detectable in integrated light are encouraging,
particularly for the prospects of detecting such anomalies in young, massive
star clusters.

achieving the high cross section into gamma gamma required. A simple

loops of charged messengers. We study the size of the dimension 5 dipole (for a
pseudo-Dirac state) and dimension 7 Rayleigh operators in such a model,
including all higher order corrections in 1/M_{mess}. Such corrections tend to
enhance the annihilation rates beyond the naive effective operators. We find
that while freezeout is generally dominated by the dipole, the present day
gamma-ray signatures are dominated by the Rayleigh operator, except at the most
strongly coupled points, motivating a hybrid approach. With this, the Magnetic
inelastic Dark Matter scenario provides a successful explanation of the lines
at only moderately strong coupling. We also consider the pure Majorana WIMP,
where both freezeout and the Fermi lines can be explained, but only at very
strong coupling with light (~200 - 300 GeV) messengers. In both cases there is
no conflict with non-observation of continuum photons.

evaluate the usage of the MgII(2798A) and CIV(1549A) lines, and adjacent
continuum bands, as estimators of M_BH and L/L_Edd, by focusing on sources
where one of these lines is observed together with Hbeta. We present a new,
luminosity-dependent bolometric correction for the monochromatic luminosity at
3000A, L_3000, which is lower by a factor of 1.75 than those used in previous
studies. We also re-calibrate the use of L_3000 as an indicator for the size of
the broad emission line region (R_BLR) and find that R_BLR is proportional to
L_3000^0.62. We find that FWHM(MgII)\simeqFWHM(Hb) for all sources with
FWHM(MgII)<6000 km/s. Beyond this FWHM, the MgII line width seems to saturate.
The spectral region of the MgII line can thus be used to reproduce Hb-based
estimates of M_BH and L/L_Edd, with negligible systematic differences and a
scatter of 0.3 dex. The width of the CIV line, on the other hand, shows no
correlation with either that of the Hb or the MgII lines and we could not
identify the reason for this discrepancy. The scatter of M_BH(CIV), relative to
M_BH(Hb) is of almost 0.5 dex. Moreover, 46% of the sources have
FWHM(CIV)<FWHM(Hb), in contrast with the basic premise of the virial method,
which predicts FWHM(CIV)/FWHM(Hbeta)~1.9. Thus, the CIV line cannot be used to
obtain precise estimates of M_BH. We conclude by presenting the observed
evolution of M_BH and L/L_Edd with cosmic epoch. The steep rise of L/L_Edd with
redshift up to z~1 flattens towards the expected maximal value of L/L_Edd~1,
with lower-M_BH sources showing higher values of L/L_Edd at all redshifts.

128 GeV has been found in Fermi-LAT data from the center of the galaxy and from
unassociated point sources. Many explanations in terms of dark matter particle
pairs annihilating to gamma gamma and gamma Z have been suggested, but these
typically require very large couplings or mysterious coincidences in the masses
of several new particles to fit the signal strength. We propose a simple novel
explanation in which dark matter is part of a multiplet of new states which all
have mass near 260 GeV as a result of symmetry. Two dark matter particles
annihilate to a pair of neutral particles in this multiplet which subsequently
decay to gamma gamma and gamma Z. For example, one may have a triplet of
pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone bosons, charged pions and a neutral pion, where the
charged pions are stabilized by their charge under a new U(1) symmetry and the
slightly lighter neutral pion state decays to gamma gamma and gamma Z. The
symmetry structure of such a model explains the near degeneracy in masses
needed for the resulting photons to have a line-like shape and the large
observed flux. The tunable lifetime of the neutral state allows such models to
go unseen at direct detection or collider experiments that can constrain most
other explanations. However, nucleosynthesis constraints on the neutral pion
lifetime fix a minimum necessary coupling between the new multiplet and the
Standard Model. The spectrum is predicted to be not a line but a box with a
width of order a few GeV, smaller than but on the order of the Fermi-LAT
resolution.

Carlo approach. The existence of two physically distinct quasar populations,
the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars, is controversial and over the last
decade a bimodal distribution of radio loudness of quasars has been both
affirmed and disputed. We model the quasar radio luminosity distribution with
simple unimodal and bimodal distribution functions. The resulting simulated
samples are compared to a fiducial sample of 8,300 quasars drawn from the SDSS
DR7 Quasar Catalog and combined with radio observations from the FIRST survey.
Our results indicate that the SDSS-FIRST sample is best described by a radio
loudness distribution which consists of two components, with 12+/-1 % of
sources in the radio-loud component. On the other hand, the evidence for a
local minimum in the loudness distribution (bimodality) is not strong and we
find that previous claims for its existence were probably affected by the
incompleteness of the FIRST survey close to its faint limit. We also
investigate the redshift and luminosity dependence of the radio loudness
distribution and find tentative evidence that at high redshift radio-loud
quasars were rarer, on average ""louder"", and exhibited a smaller range in radio
loudness. In agreement with other recent work, we conclude that the SDSS-FIRST
sample strongly suggests that the radio loudness distribution of quasars is not
a universal function, and that more complex models than presented here are

starbursts, rare in the Local Universe but more common at high redshift,
deviate significantly from these scaling relations. On the ""main sequence"" of
star formation, these galaxies have high SFR for a given M*; and on the
mass-metallicity relation, they have excess M* for their low metallicity. In
this paper, we characterize O/H, M*, and SFR for these deviant ""low-metallicity

Lyman Break galaxies at redshifts 1-3.4. Applying a Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) to the galaxies in our sample with M*<10^{10} Msun gives a
Fundamental Plane (FP) of scaling relations; SFR and stellar mass define the
plane itself, and O/H its thickness. The dispersion for our sample in the
edge-on view of the plane is 0.17 dex, independently of redshift and including
the metal-poor starbursts. The same FP is followed by 55100 galaxies selected
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, with a dispersion of 0.06dex. In a companion
paper, we develop multi-phase chemical evolution models that successfully
predict the observed scaling relations and the FP; the deviations from the main
scaling relations are caused by a different (starburst or ""active"") mode of
star formation. These scaling relations do not truly evolve, but rather are
defined by the different galaxy populations dominant at different cosmological
epochs.

stellar mass give important insight on galaxy evolution. They are obeyed by
most galaxies in the Local Universe and also at high redshift. In a companion
paper, we compiled a sample of ~1100 galaxies from redshift 0 to ~3, spanning
almost two orders of magnitude in metal abundance, a factor of $\sim10^6$ in
SFR, and of ~10^5 in stellar mass. We have characterized empirically the
star-formation ""main sequence"" (SFMS) and the mass-metallicity relation (MZR)
for this sample, and also identified a class of low-metallicity starbursts,
rare locally but more common in the distant universe. These galaxies deviate
significantly from the main scaling relations, with high SFR and low metal
content for a given M*. In this paper, we model the scaling relations and
explain these deviations from them with a set of multi-phase chemical evolution
models based on the idea that, independently of redshift, initial physical
conditions in a galaxy's evolutionary history can dictate its location in the
scaling relations. Our models are able to successfully reproduce the O/H, M*,
and SFR scaling relations up to z~3, and also successfully predict the
molecular cloud fraction as a function of stellar mass. These results suggest
that the scaling relations are defined by different modes of star formation: an
""active"" starburst mode, more common at high redshift, and a quiescent
""passive"" mode that is predominant locally and governs the main trends.

contains a phase-incoherent paired electron and unpaired hole Fermi surfaces.
We show that even a weak current tilts the paired band and reveals parts of the
previously gapped electron Fermi surface in ARPES if the binding energy is
smaller but close to the pseudogap. Stronger currents can also reveal the Fermi
surface through direct suppression of pairing. The proposed experiment is
sufficiently general such that it can be used to reveal putative Fermi surfaces
that have been reconstructed from other types of periodic order and are gapped
out due to pairing. The observation of the predicted phenomena should help
resolve the central question about the existence of pairs in the enigmatic

Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) code and a grid-based hydrodynamics code, FARGO,
to understand the previous non-convergent results reported by Meru & Bate
(2011a). We obtain evidence that convergence with increasing resolution occurs
with both SPH and FARGO and in both cases we find that the critical cooling
timescale is larger than previously thought. We show that SPH has a first-order
convergence rate while FARGO converges with a second-order rate. We show that
the convergence of the critical cooling timescale for fragmentation depends
largely on the numerical viscosity employed in both SPH and FARGO. With SPH,
particle velocity dispersion may also play a role. We show that reducing the
dissipation from the numerical viscosity leads to larger values of the critical
cooling time at a given resolution. For SPH, we find that the effect of the
dissipation due to the numerical viscosity is somewhat larger than had
previously been appreciated. In particular, we show that using a quadratic term
in the SPH artificial viscosity (beta_{SPH}) that is too low appears to lead to
excess dissipation in gravitationally unstable discs, which may affect any
results that sensitively depend on the thermodynamics, such as disc
fragmentation. We show that the two codes converge to values of the critical
cooling timescale, beta_{crit} > 20 (for a ratio of specific heats of
gamma=5/3), and perhaps even as large as beta_{crit} \approx 30. These are
approximately 3-5 times larger than has been found by most previous studies.
This is equivalent to a maximum gravitational stress that a disc can withstand
without fragmenting of alpha_{GI,crit} \approx 0.013-0.02, which is much
smaller than the values typically used in the literature. It is therefore
easier for self-gravitating discs to fragment than has been concluded from most
past studies.

argument that the image of the city arises from the underlying scaling of city
artifacts or locations. This scaling refers to the fact that, in an imageable
city (a city that can easily be imaged in human minds), small city artifacts
are far more common than large ones; or alternatively low dense locations are
far more common than high dense locations. The sizes of city artifacts in a
rank-size plot exhibit a heavy tailed distribution consisting of the head,
which is composed of a minority of unique artifacts (vital and very important),
and the tail, which is composed of redundant other artifacts (trivial and less
important). Eventually, those extremely unique and vital artifacts in the top
head, i.e., what Lynch called city elements, make up the image of the city. We
argue that the ever-increasing amount of geographic information on cities, in
particular obtained from social media such as Flickr and Twitter, can turn
research on the image of the city, or cognitive mapping in general, into a
quantitative manner. The scaling property might be formulated as a law of
geography.

  Constraints",,,,,"cs.SY math.DS math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider that a linear time-invariant (LTI) plant is given and that we wish
to design a stabilizing controller for it. Admissible controllers are LTI and
must comply with a pre-selected sparsity pattern. The sparsity pattern is
assumed to be quadratically invariant (QI) with respect to the plant, which,
from prior results, guarantees that there is a convex parametrization of all
admissible stabilizing controllers provided that an initial admissible stable
stabilizing controller is provided. This paper addresses the previously
unsolved problem of determining necessary and sufficient conditions for the
existence of an admissible stabilizing controller. The main idea is to cast the
existence of such a controller as the feasibility of an exact model-matching
problem with stability restrictions, which can be tackled using existing
methods. Furthermore, we show that, when it exists, the solution of the
model-matching problem can be used to compute an admissible stabilizing
controller. This method also leads to a convex parametrization that may be
viewed as an extension of Youla's classical approach so as to incorporate
sparsity constraints. Applications of this parametrization on the design of
norm-optimal controllers via convex methods are also explored. An illustrative
example is provided, and a special case is discussed for which the exact model
matching problem has a unique and easily computable solution.

regular cardinal $\gamma<\delta$, and in which $\delta$ remains Woodin.
  I also present a new example in which forcing a certain behavior of the
continuum function on the regular cardinals, while preserving a given large
cardinal, requires large cardinal strength beyond that of the original large
cardinal under consideration. Specifically, I prove that the existence of a
$\lambda$-supercompact cardinal $\kappa$ such that $\GCH$ fails at $\lambda$ is
equiconsistent with the existence of a cardinal $\kappa$ that is
$\lambda$-supercompact and $\lambda^{++}$-tall.
  I generalize a theorem on measurable cardinals due to Levinski, which says
that given a measurable cardinal, there is a forcing extension preserving the
measurability of $\kappa$ in which $\kappa$ is the least regular cardinal at
which $\GCH$ holds. Indeed, I show that Levinski's result can be extended to
many other large cardinal contexts. This work paves the way for many additional
results, analogous to the results stated above for Woodin cardinals and

the form $X_i=\sum_{j \in \bZ}c_j \xi_{i-j}$ with i.i.d. innovations

weak convergence result is obtained in space $\bD[0,1]$ endowed with the
$S$-topology introduced in Jakubowski (1992), and the limit process is a linear
fractional stable motion (LFSM). One of our result provides an extension of the
results of Avram and Taqqu (1992) to the case when the coefficients $(c_j)_{j

recent criteria for convergence in Skorokhod's $M_1$-topology (due to Louhichi

sum of two processes with the weak $M_1$-convergence of the two individual

three objects present on both and identified a unique, point-like optical

irradiated disk model if the extinction measured for Cepheids in NGC 247 is
used. Assuming only Galactic extinction, then the spectrum can be modeled as a
standard thin accretion disk. Either result leads to the conclusion that a disk
interpretation of the X-ray spectrum is valid, thus the source may be in the
X-ray thermal state and contain an intermediate mass black hole of at least 600
solar masses. In contrast to other supersoft ULXs which are transient and
exhibit a luminosity temperature relation inconsistent with a disk
interpretation of the X-ray emission, the NGC 247 ULX has a relatively steady
flux and all available X-ray data are consistent with emission from a disk in
the thermal state.

energy region which grows with increasing gluon damping rate and increasing
energy of the heavy quark. Thus, just as polarization effects in the plasma
render the bremsstrahlung spectra independent of the quark mass in the soft

problem in D=4 N=2 Seiberg-Witten theories. We start with a brief review of the
multi-centered nature of the typical BPS states and recall how the
wall-crossing problem thus becomes really a bound state formation/dissociation
problem. Low energy dynamics for arbitrary collections of dyons is derived,
from Seiberg-Witten theory, with the proximity to the so-called marginal
stability wall playing the role of the small expansion parameter. We find that,
surprisingly, the $\mathbb{R}^{3n}$ low energy dynamics of n+1 BPS dyons cannot
be consistently reduced to the classical moduli space, $\CM$, yet the index can
be phrased in terms of $\CM$. We also explain how an equivariant version of
this index computes the protected spin character of the underlying field
theory, where $SO(3)_\CJ$ isometry of $\CM$ turns out to be the diagonal
subgroup of $SU(2)_L$ spatial rotation and $SU(2)_R$ R-symmetry. The so-called
rational invariants, previously seen in the Kontsevich-Soibelman formalism of
wall-crossing, are shown to emerge naturally from the orbifolding projection
due to Bose/Fermi statistics.

simulations of the waves excited in an accretion disc by a rotating star with a
dipole magnetic field misaligned from the star's rotation axis (which is
aligned with the disc axis). The main results are the following: (1) If the
magnetosphere of the star corotates approximately with the inner disc, then we
observe a strong one-armed bending wave (a warp). This warp corotates with the
star and has a maximum amplitude between corotation radius and the radius of
the vertical resonance. The disc's center of mass can deviate from the
equatorial plane up to the distance of z_w\approx 0.1 r. However, the effective
height of the warp can be larger, h_w \approx 0.3 r due to the finite thickness
of the disc. Stars with a range of misalignment angles excite warps. However,
the amplitude of the warps is larger for misalignment angles between 15 and 60
degrees. (2) If the magnetosphere rotates slower, than the inner disc, then a
bending wave is excited at the disc-magnetosphere boundary, but does not form a
large-scale warp. Instead, high-frequency oscillations become strong at the
inner region of the disc. These are (a) trapped density waves which form inside
the radius where the disc angular velocity has a maximum, and (b) inner bending
waves which appear in the case of accretion through magnetic Raleigh-Taylor
instability. These two types of waves are connected with the inner disc and
their frequencies will vary with accretion rate. Bending oscillations at lower
frequencies are also excited including global oscillations of the disc. In
cases where the simulation region is small, slowly-precessing warp forms.
Simulations are applicable to young stars, cataclysmic variables, and accreting
millisecond pulsars.

spaces with reproducing kernels defined on nonsymmetric domains instead of the
traditional methods in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Using the
orthogonality of semi-inner-products, we can obtain the explicit
representations of the dual (normalized-duality-mapping) elements of support
vector machine solutions. In addition, we can introduce the reproduction
property in a generalized native space by Fourier transform techniques such
that it becomes a reproducing kernel Banach space, which can be even embedded
into Sobolev spaces, and its reproducing kernel is set up by the related
positive definite function. The representations of the optimal solutions of
support vector machines (regularized empirical risks) in these reproducing
kernel Banach spaces are formulated explicitly in terms of positive definite
functions, and their finite numbers of coefficients can be computed by fixed
point iteration. We also give some typical examples of reproducing kernel
Banach spaces induced by Mat\'ern functions (Sobolev splines) so that their
support vector machine solutions are well computable as the classical
algorithms. Moreover, each of their reproducing bases includes information from
multiple training data points. The concept of reproducing kernel Banach spaces
offers us a new numerical tool for solving support vector machines.

present the results of a survey covering all of M31's optical disk (2.2 deg^2),

107 newly found WR stars, mostly of WN-type. This brings the total number of
spectroscopically confirmed WRs in M31 to 154, a number we argue is complete to
~95%, except in regions of unusually high reddening. This number is consistent
with what we expect from the integrated Halpha luminosity compared to that of
M33. The majority of these WRs formed in OB associations around the Population
I ring, although 5% are truly isolated. Both the relative number of WC to
WN-type stars as well as the WC subtype distribution suggest that most WRs
exist in environments with higher-than-solar metallicities, which is consistent
with studies of M31's metallicity. Although the WC-to-WN ratio we find for M31

mostly high ionization state plasmas in the magnetic clouds in interplanetary
coronal mass ejections (ICME) events, while low ionization states are rarely

plasmas observed by UVCS occupy small enough fractions of the CME to be
consistent with the small fraction of ACE ICMEs that show low ionization

in CMEs observed by UVCS show average covering factors below 10%. This
indicates that the lack of low ionization state ICME plasmas observed by the

region of low ionization plasma. We also find that the low ionization state
plasma covering factors in faster CMEs are smaller than in slower CMEs.

most participants seemed to favour the Single Degenerate channel, there was no
general agreement on the type of binary system at play. An observational puzzle
that was highlighted was the apparent paucity of Super-Soft Sources in our
Galaxy and also in external galaxies. The Single Degenerate channel (and as it
was pointed out, quite possibly also the Double Degenerate channel) requires
the binary system to pass through a phase of steady nuclear burning. However,
the observed number of Super-Soft sources falls short by a factor of up to 100
in explaining the estimated birth rates of SNeIa. Thus, are these Super-Soft
sources somehow hidden away and radiating at different wavelengths or are we
missing some important pieces of this puzzle that may lead to the elimination
of a certain class of progenitor? Another unanswered question concerns the
dependence of SNeIa luminosities on the age of their host galaxy. Several
hypotheses were put forward, but none was singled out as the most likely
explanation.

redshift z~1.6 to z~0. We use the semi-analytic model of Croton et al. (2006)
with a new spectro-photometric model based on the Maraston (2005) stellar
populations and a new recipe for the dust extinction. We compare the model
predictions of the K-band luminosity evolution and the J-K, V-I and I-K colour
evolution with a series of datasets, including Collins et al. (Nature, 2009)
who argued that semi-analytic models based on the Millennium simulation cannot
reproduce the red colours and high luminosity of BCGs at z>1. We show instead
that the model is well in range of the observed luminosity and correctly
reproduces the colour evolution of BCGs in the whole redshift range up to
z~1.6. We argue that the success of the semi-analytic model is in large part
due to the implementation of a more sophisticated spectro-photometric model. An
analysis of the model BCGs shows an increase in mass by a factor ~2 since z~1,
and star formation activity down to low redshifts. While the consensus
regarding BCGs is that they are passively evolving, we argue that this
conclusion is affected by the degeneracy between star formation history and
stellar population models used in SED-fitting, and by the inefficacy of
toy-models of passive evolution to capture the complexity of real galaxies,
expecially those with rich merger histories like BCGs. Following this argument,
we also show that in the semi-analytic model the BCGs show a realistic mix of
stellar populations, and that these stellar populations are mostly old. In
addition, the age-redshift relation of the model BCGs follows that of the
universe, meaning that given their merger history and star formation history,
the ageing of BCGs is always dominated by the ageing of their stellar
populations. In a LambdaCDM universe, we define such evolution as ""passive in
the hierarchical sense"".

  Optical stellar intensity interferometry (SII) with ACT arrays, composed of
nearly 100 telescopes, will provide means to measure fundamental stellar
parameters and also open the possibility of model-independent imaging. A data
analysis algorithm is developed and permits the reconstruction of high angular
resolution images from simulated SII data. The capabilities and limitations of
future ACT arrays used for high angular resolution imaging are investigated via
Monte-Carlo simulations. Simple stellar objects as well as stellar surfaces
with localized hot or cool regions can be accurately imaged.

expounded. The functionality of analog and digital correlators is demonstrated.
Intensity correlations have been measured for a simulated star emitting
pseudo-thermal light, resulting in angular diameter measurements. The StarBase

and magnetism of Fe1+yTe0.5Se0.5 (y=0.04 and 0.09) single crystals. Both
compositions exhibit resistively determined superconducting transitions (Tc)
with an onset temperature of about 15 K. From the width of the superconducting
transition and the magnitude of the lower critical field Hc1, it is inferred
that excess of Fe suppresses superconductivity. The linear and non-linear
responses of the ac-susceptibility show that the superconducting state for
these compositions is inhomogeneous. A possible origin of this phase separation
is a magnetic coupling between Fe-excess occupying interstitial sites in the
chalcogen planes and those in the Fe-square lattice. The temperature derivative
of the resistivity drho/dT in the temperature range Tc < T < Ta with Ta being
the temperature of a magnetic anomaly, changes from positive to negative with
increasing Fe. A log 1/T divergence of the resistivity above Tc in the sample
with higher amount of Fe suggests a disorder driven electronic localization.

which we couple with various filtering methods and test thoroughly for
convergence. We included the effect of inhomogeneous noise as well as
astrophysical biases induced by point sources and by the contamination from the
Galaxy. We find that, when Wiener filtered maps are used (rather than simply
smoothed with Gaussian), the expected error on the measurement of f_NL should
be as small as \Delta f_NL \simeq 10 when combining the 3 channels at 100, 143

insensitive to the non homogeneous nature of the noise, at least for realistic
hit-maps expected from Planck. We then estimate the bias induced on the
measurement of f_NL by point sources in those 3 channels. With the appropriate
masking of the bright sources, this bias can be reduced to a negligible level
in the 100 and 143 GHz channels. It remains significant in the 217 GHz channel,
but can be corrected for. The galactic foreground biases are quite important
and present a complex dependence on sky coverage: making them negligible will
depend strongly on the quality of the component separation methods.

theories, applied to two experimental domains : the search for the Higgs bosons
at colliders and the Dark Matter observables. The reason for introducing an
effective approach in the Higgs physics is that the simple supersymmetric
extension of the Standard Model (the MSSM) is known to have a tightly
constrained Higgs sector, in particular with a lightest Higgs mass difficult to
raise without introducing some fine-tuning. Many specific expansions (as the
NMSSM for instance) allow for a richer Higgs sector. In this case however, the
effective approach is handy since it encompasses many different specific
ultraviolet completions. We have added to the Kahler and superpotential of the
MSSM all possible terms of dimensions 5 and 6 including only Higgs superfields.
The phenomenology of the resulting Higgs sector appears to be much richer, and
we analyse our model in view of the latest LHC results. On the other side,
supersymmetry is known for providing a Dark Matter candidate, so we have also
worked to improve the accuracy of the computation of the relic density in the
MSSM. Indeed the impressive accuracy on the experimental side (around 6%) calls
for a precise computation including radiative corrections. Those one-loop
computations being rather long in the MSSM, thus often overlooked, we have used
again the effective approach by introducing new effective vertices that aim at
accounting for the one-loop correction. We show on a specific process
(neutralinos annihilation to muons) the agreement between the effective
approach and the full one-loop computation.

to detect the corresponding clouds. The results of this study are then adopted
to select the best possible sites in Indonesia to be analysed further by
performing in situ measurements planned for the coming years. The results
suggest that regions of East Nusa Tenggara, located in south-eastern part of
Indonesia, are the most promising candidates for such an astronomical site.
Yearly clear sky fraction of this regions may reach better than 70 per cent

uncertainty was reduced from 13% to 4%. By measuring the yield of the
characteristic X-rays, the cross sections of the 127I(alpha,gamma)131Cs

relevant energy region, at energies 9.50 < Ec.m. < 15.15$ MeV. The
127I(alpha,n)130Cs reaction was studied in the range 9.62 < Ec.m. < 15.15 MeV

resulting cross sections to predictions of statistical model calculations
confirmed the predictions of the astrophysically relevant averaged alpha width.
Nevertheless, the newly derived stellar reaction rates at gamma process
temperatures for 127I(alpha,gamma)131$Cs and its reverse reaction are factors
4-10 faster than previous calculations, due to improvements in the reaction

paramagnetic tetragonal (P4/nmm) to the antiferromagnetic monoclinic (P2_1/m)
phase. We show that, at a pressure of 1.33 GPa, the low temperature structure
adopts an orthorhombic symmetry. More importantly, for pressures of 2.29 GPa
and higher, a symmetry-conserving tetragonal-tetragonal phase transition has
been identified from a change in the c/a ratio of the lattice parameters. The
succession of different pressure and temperature-induced structural and
magnetic phases indicates the presence of strong magneto-elastic coupling
effects in this material.

study of ordinary Fully Packed Loop configurations (FPLs) on the square grid
where they were used to show that the number of FPLs with a given link pattern
that has m nested arches is a polynomial function in m. It soon turned out that
TFPLs possess a number of other nice properties. For instance, they can be seen
as a generalized model of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We start our
article by introducing oriented versions of TFPLs; their main advantage in
comparison with ordinary TFPLs is that they involve only local constraints.
Three main contributions are provided. Firstly, we show that the number of
ordinary TFPLs can be extracted from a weighted enumeration of oriented TFPLs
and thus it suffices to consider the latter. Secondly, we decompose oriented
TFPLs into two matchings and use a classical bijection to obtain two families
of nonintersecting lattice paths (path tangles). This point of view turns out
to be extremely useful for giving easy proofs of previously known conditions on
the boundary of TFPLs necessary for them to exist. One example is the
inequality d(u)+d(v)<=d(w) where u,v,w are 01-words that encode the boundary
conditions of ordinary TFPLs and d(u) is the number of cells in the Ferrers
diagram associated with u. In the third part we consider TFPLs with d(w)-
d(u)-d(v)=0,1; in the first case their numbers are given by
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, but also in the second case we provide
formulas that are in terms of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. The proofs of
these formulas are of a purely combinatorial nature.

cannot fully explain the initial conditions of the Universe. Inflation, an
exponential expansion in the first 10^-36s, is a promising potential
explanation. A generic prediction of inflation is odd-parity (B-mode)
polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The Q/U Imaging
ExperimenT (QUIET) aimed to limit or detect this polarization.
  We built a coherent pseudo-correlation microwave polarimeter. An array of
mass-produced modules populated the focal plane of a 1.4m telescope. Each
module had a sensitivity to polarization of 756muK sqrt{s} with a bandwidth of
10.7+/-1.1 GHz centered at 94.5+/-0.8 GHz; the combined sensitivity was
87+/-7muK sqrt{s}. We incorporated deck rotation, an absorbing ground screen, a
new time-stream double-demodulation technique, and optimized optics into the
design to reduce instrumental polarization. We observed with this instrument at
the Atacama Plateau in Chile between August 2009 and December 2010. We
collected 5336.9 hours of CMB observation and 1090 hours of astronomical
calibration.
  This thesis describes the analysis and results of these data. We
characterized the instrument using the astronomical calibration data as well as
purpose-built artificial sources. We developed noise modeling, filtering, and
data selection following a blind-analysis strategy. Central to this strategy
was a suite of 32 null tests, each motivated by a possible instrumental problem

these stars. The evidence for the radius discrepancies has grown over the years
as more and more determinations have become available; however, fewer of these

contact and the electron-electron interaction in the one-dimensional edge
states. The electron-electron interaction is treated within the Luttinger
liquid model. The main effect of the interaction stems from the renormalization
of the electron velocity, due to which the polarization increases with the
interaction strength. Electron scattering by the contact leads to a decrease in
$P$. A specific effect occurs when the bottom of the subbands in the waveguide
crosses the Dirac point of the spectrum of edge states when changing the
voltage or chemical potential. This leads to changing the direction of the spin

can be enhanced even under isotropic fading and no channel state information
(or output feedback) at the transmitters (CSIT) is investigated. Toward this
end, the two-user MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) broadcast and
interference channels are studied with no side-information whatsoever at the
transmitters and with receivers equipped with full-duplex radios. The
full-duplex feature allows for receiver cooperation because each receiver, in
addition to receiving the signals sent by the transmitters, can also
simultaneously transmit a signal in the same band to the other receiver. Unlike
the case of MIMO networks with CSIT and full-duplex receivers, for which DoF
are known, it is shown that for MIMO networks with no CSIT, full-duplex
receiver cooperation is beneficial to such an extent that even the DoF region
is enhanced. Indeed, for important classes of two-user MIMO broadcast and
interference channels, defined by certain relationships on numbers of antennas
at different terminals, the exact DoF regions are established. The key to
achieving DoF-optimal performance for such networks are new retro-cooperative
interference alignment schemes. Their optimality is established via the DoF
analysis of certain genie-aided or enhanced version of those networks.

mass anomalous dimension = 1. Vacuum polarization screens the interaction
strength. Consequently, the pattern of dynamical mass generation for fermions
is characterized by a critical number of massless fermion flavors above which
chiral symmetry is restored. This effect is in diametrical opposition to the
existence of criticality for the minimum interaction strength necessary to
break chiral symmetry dynamically. The presence of virtual fermions dictates
the nature of phase transition. Miransky scaling laws for the electromagnetic
interaction strength and the four-fermion coupling, observed for quenched QED,
are replaced by a mean-field power law behavior corresponding to a second order
phase transition. These results are derived analytically by employing the
bifurcation analysis, and are later confirmed numerically by solving the
original non-linearized gap equation. A three dimensional critical surface is
drawn to clearly depict the interplay of the relative strengths of interactions
and number of flavors to separate the two phases. We also compute the
beta-function and observe that it has ultraviolet fixed point. The power law

as the best motivated example, and so we ask whether these non-linearities are
able to screen a scalar fifth force. We find that a Vainshtein-like screening
mechanism exists for such models although with limited applicability. For
instance, we cannot find a screening mechanism for DBI models. On the other

the apparent existence of spirals at a relatively young stage and also the
asymmetric disk traced in thermal dust emission. However, the physical
conditions of the spirals are still not well understood. The origin of the
asymmetric thermal emission is unclear.
  We observed the disk at 230 GHz (1.3 mm) in both the continuum and the
spectral line ^12CO J=2-1 with IRAM 30-m, the Plateau de Bure interferometer,
and the Submillimeter Array to sample all spatial scales from 0.37"" to about
50"". To combine the data obtained from these telescopes, several methods and
calibration issues were checked and discussed.
  The 1.3 mm continuum (dust) emission is resolved into inner disk and outer
ring. Molecular gas at high velocities traced by the CO line is detected next
to the stellar location. The inclination angle of the disk is found to decrease
toward the center. On a larger scale, based on the intensity weighted
dispersion and the integrated intensity map of ^12CO J=2-1, four spirals are
identified, where two of them are also detected in the near infrared. The total
gas mass of the 4 spirals (M_spiral) is 10^-7 < M_spiral < 10^-5 M_sun, which
is 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the mass of the gas ring. Surprisingly,
the CO gas inside the spiral is apparently counter-rotating with respect to the
CO disk, and it only exhibits small radial motion.
  The wide gap, the warped disk, and the asymmetric dust ring suggest that
there is an undetected companion with a mass of 0.03 M_sun at a radius of 45
AU. Although an hypothetical fly-by cannot be ruled out, the most likely
explanation of the AB Aurigae system may be inhomogeneous accretion well above
or below the main disk plane from the remnant envelope, which can explain both

volatility changes are prominent features, like most financial data. The
parameter estimation via quasi maximum likelihood (QMLE) and its properties are
by now well understood. However, there is a gap between practical applications
and the theory, as in reality there are usually not enough observations for the
limit results to be valid approximations. We try to fill this gap by this
paper, where the properties of a recent bootstrap methodology in the context of
GARCH modeling are revealed. The results are promising as it turns out that
this remarkably simple method has essentially the same limit distribution, as
the original estimatorwith the advantage of easy confidence interval
construction, as it is demonstrated in the paper.
  The finite-sample properties of the suggested estimators are investigated
through a simulation study, which ensures that the results are practically
applicable for sample sizes as low as a thousand. On the other hand, the
results are not 100% accurate until sample size reaches 100 thousands - but it
is shown that this property is not a feature of our bootstrap procedure only,
as it is shared by the original QMLE, too.

of a meson-meson type, viz. $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ in this case, with no other
significant components. We address this issue by employing a simple two-channel
Schr\""odinger model, in which the $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $c\bar{c}$ and
$D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ channels can communicate via the $^3P_0$ mechanism, mimicked

the $c\bar{c}$ component remains quite substantial and certainly not
negligible, despite accounting for only about 6 to 10% of the total

allow marginally stable orbits for hypothetical, terrestrial planets. In this
paper, we propose that many of these systems may not have additional planets on
these ""stable"" orbits, since past dynamical instability among giant planets
could have removed them. We numerically investigate the effects of early
evolution of multiple giant planets on the orbital stability of the inner,
sub-Neptune-like planets which are modeled as test particles, and determine
their dynamically unstable region. Previous studies have shown that the
majority of such test particles are ejected out of the system as a result of
close encounters with giant planets. Here, we show that secular perturbations
from giant planets can remove test particles at least down to 10 times smaller
than their minimum pericenter distance. Our results indicate that, unless the
dynamical instability among giant planets is either absent or quiet like
planet-planet collisions, most test particles down to ~0.1 AU within the orbits
of giant planets at a few AU may be gone. In fact, out of ~30 % of survived
test particles, about three quarters belong to the planet-planet collision
cases. We find a good agreement between our numerical results and the secular
theory, and present a semi-analytical formula which estimates the dynamically
unstable region of the test particles just from the evolution of giant planets.
Finally, our numerical results agree well with the observations, and also
predict the existence of hot rocky planets in eccentric giant planet systems.

others choices (cases coined 'positive externalities' or 'bandwagon effect' in

price, there is either a small number of buyers, or a large one -- in which
case one says that the customers coordinate. This leads to a dilemma for the
seller: should he sell at a high price, targeting a small number of buyers, or
at low price targeting a large number of buyers? In this paper we show that the
interaction between demand and supply is even more complex than expected,
leading to what we call the curse of coordination: the pricing strategy for the

obtained by the detailed mathematical analysis of a particular model formally
related to the Random Field Ising Model and to a model introduced in social
sciences by T C Schelling in the 70's.

synopsis for two-dimensional datasets such as geospatial datasets. The current
state-of-the-art methods work by performing recursive binary partitioning of
the data domains, and constructing a hierarchy of partitions. We show that the
key challenge in partition-based synopsis methods lies in choosing the right
partition granularity to balance the noise error and the non-uniformity error.
We study the uniform-grid approach, which applies an equi-width grid of a
certain size over the data domain and then issues independent count queries on
the grid cells. This method has received no attention in the literature,
probably due to the fact that no good method for choosing a grid size was
known. Based on an analysis of the two kinds of errors, we propose a method for
choosing the grid size. Experimental results validate our method, and show that
this approach performs as well as, and often times better than, the
state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a novel adaptive-grid method.
The adaptive grid method lays a coarse-grained grid over the dataset, and then
further partitions each cell according to its noisy count. Both levels of
partitions are then used in answering queries over the dataset. This method
exploits the need to have finer granularity partitioning over dense regions
and, at the same time, coarse partitioning over sparse regions. Through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we show that this approach
consistently and significantly outperforms the uniform-grid method and other
state-of-the-art methods.

networks. We focus on the distribution of energy consumed by a base station for
one isolated cell. We first define the energy consumption model in which the
consumed energy is divided into two parts: The additive part and the broadcast
part. The broadcast part is the part of energy which is oblivious of the number
of mobile stations but depends on the farthest terminal, for instance, the
energy effort necessary to maintain the beacon signal. The additive part is due
to the communication power which depends on both the positions, mobility and
activity of all the users. We evaluate by closed form expressions the mean and
variance of the consumed energy. Our analytic evaluation is based on the
hypothesis that mobiles are distributed according to a Poisson point process.
We show that the two parts of energy are of the same order of magnitude and
that substantial gain can be obtained by power control. We then consider the
impact of mobility on the energy consumption. We apply our model to two case
studies: The first one is to optimize the cell radius from the energetic point
of view, the second one is to dimension the battery of a base station in sites
that do not have access to permanent power supply.

investigated in the variational cluster approximation. The critical interaction
for the paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition is found to be in
remarkable agreement with a recent large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation.
Calculated staggered magnetization increases continuously with $U$ and thus we
find the phase transition is of a second order. We also find that the
semimetal-insulator transition occurs at infinitesimally small interaction and
thus a paramagnetic insulating state appears in a wide interaction range. A
crossover behavior of electrons from itinerant to localized character found in
the calculated single-particle excitation spectra and short-range spin
correlation functions indicates that an effective spin model for the
paramagnetic insulating phase is far from a simple Heisenberg model with a
nearest-neighbor exchange interaction.
