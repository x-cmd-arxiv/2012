As increasingly more spectroscopic data are being delivered by

the spectra collected also allows the determination of elemental abundances.
Aims. SPADES is an automated software for determining: the radial velocity
(Vr), the effective temperature (Teff), the surface gravity (log g), the
metallicity ([Fe/H]), and most importantly, the individual abundances. In this
first version it is targeted on the analysis of mid-F-G dwarfs, but is meant to
evolve to analyze any type of single stars. Methods. SPADES relies on a
line-by-line modeling to determine the stellar parameters. Results. The
internal systematic and random errors of SPADES were assessed by Monte Carlo
method simulations with synthetic spectra and the external systematic errors by
analysing real ground-based observed spectra. For example, by simulating the
Giraffe setups HR13 and HR14B with synthetic spectra for a dwarf with Teff =
5800 K, log g = 4.5, [Fe/H] = 0.0 dex and with a signal-tonoise ratio (S/N) of
100, the stellar parameters are recovered with no significant bias and with
1-{\sigma} precisions of 8 K for Teff, 0.05 for log g, 0.009 for [Fe/H], 0.003
for [Ti/Fe] and 0.01 for [Ni/Fe].

interact with the systems creating fluctuating query request rates, requiring
the search algorithm to adapt in order to better utilize the underline hardware
to reduce response times. In order to address these challenges, we introduce
hypercurves, a flexible framework for answering approximate k-nearest neighbor
(kNN) queries for very large multimedia databases, aiming at online
content-based multimedia services. Hypercurves executes on hybrid CPU--GPU
environments, and is able to employ those devices cooperatively to support
massive query request rates. In order to keep the response times optimal as the
request rates vary, it employs a novel dynamic scheduler to partition the work
between CPU and GPU. Hypercurves was throughly evaluated using a large database

performance improvements of up to 30x when compared to the single CPU-core
version. The dynamic work partition mechanism reduces the observed query
response times in about 50% when compared to the best static CPU--GPU task

interacting with soft photons that are produced from protons and low magnetic
fields. Assuming that protons are injected at a certain rate in a homogeneous

be described by five coupled kinetic equations, for protons, electrons,

modelled using the results of Monte-Carlo simulations and, in particular from

conversion of proton luminosity to radiation, the resulting neutrino spectra,
and the effects of time variability on proton injection, among other topics. We

However, to keep the free parameters at a minimum and facilitate an in-depth
study of the system, we have only concentrated on the case where protons are
injected; i.e., we did not consider the effects of a co-accelerated leptonic

Vassiliev filtration has a natural extension to tangles in any thickened

to overcome this obstruction by studying families of Vassiliev invariants

a universal invariant with respect to the $N$ filtration. We show that
Vassiliev invariants in the usual sense are well approximated by $N$ finite

introducing a number of precisely stated assumptions, we develop and validate
an approach in which the interface between the different phases, understood in

representing the fluctuations of the free boundaries and of the hydrodynamic
quantities appear as boundary conditions on the effective surface and require
suitable closure models. As a simple model problem we consider impingement of
free-falling droplets onto a fluid in a pool with a free surface, and a simple
algebraic closure model is proposed for this system. The resulting averaged
equations are of the free-boundary type and an efficient computational approach
based on shape optimization formulation is developed for their solution. The
computed effective surfaces exhibit consistent dependence on the problem
parameters and compare favorably with the results obtained when the data from
the actual time-dependent problem is used in lieu of the closure model.

ontological commitments by examining responses to two essay questions, coupled
with responses to supplemental quantum attitude statements. We find that, after
instruction in modern physics, many students are still exhibiting a realist
perspective in contexts where a quantum-mechanical perspective is needed. We
further find that this effect can be significantly influenced by instruction,
where we observe variations for courses with differing learning goals. We also
note that students generally do not employ either a realist or a quantum

previously argued to be dual to pure N=1 SU(N) gauge theory in four dimensions.
A model universe of order Planck size near the UV boundary dynamically flows
toward the IR with constant total energy density and accelerating expansion
followed by smooth transition to decelerating expansion and collides with the
wrapped D7-branes at the IR boundary. The model addresses the horizon and
flatness problems with most of the expansion produced during the decelerating
expansion phase. The inflationary scenario is used to generate sources of
inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background radiation and seeds for
large scale structure formation from quantum fluctuations which exit the Hubble
radius early during the accelerating expansion phase and the model addresses
the inhomogeneity problem with red tilt in the power spectrum. We propose that
the kinetic energy of the model universe is converted to matter and radiation
by the collision followed by formation of baryons that stabilizes the model
universe against gravitational force from the background at a finite distance
from the IR boundary with the wrapped D7-branes serving as sources of color.
Friedmann evolution then takes over with a positive cosmological constant term
coming from the remaining potential energy density which is interpreted as dark
energy. The magnitude of dark energy density is smaller than the total energy
density during the flow by a ratio of the scale factor when the model universe
appears in the UV to the scale factor at the moment of collision and stays
constant while the matter-radiation density falls during Friedmann expansion.

us with measurements of hundreds of thousands of nearby stars most of which
belong to the Galactic thin, thick disk or halo. Ideally, to study the Galactic
disks (both thin and thick) one should make use of the multi-dimensional
phase-space and the whole pattern of chemical abundances of their stellar
populations. In this paper, with the aid of the RAVE Survey, we study the thin
and thick disks of the Milky Way, focusing on the latter. We present a
technique to disentangle the stellar content of the two disks based on the
kinematics and other stellar parameters such as the surface gravity of the
stars. Using the Padova Galaxy Model, we checked the ability of our method to
correctly isolate the thick disk component from the Galaxy mixture of stellar
populations. We introduce selection criteria in order to clean the observed
radial velocities from the Galactic differential rotation and to take into
account the partial sky coverage of RAVE. We developed a numerical technique to
statistically disentangle thin and thick disks from their mixture. We deduce
the components of the solar motion relative to the Local Standard of Rest (LSR)
in the radial and vertical direction, the rotational lag of the thick disk
component relative to the LSR, and the square root of the absolute value of the
velocity dispersion tensor for the thick disk alone. The analysis of the thin
disk is presented in another paper. We find good agreement with previous
independent parameter determinations. In our analysis we used photometrically
determined distances. In the Appendix we show that similar values can be found

gravity. We perform an extensive statistical analysis of the model using both
frequentist and Bayesian frameworks and employ the constraints on the expansion
history of the Universe from the observations of supernovae, the cosmic
microwave background and the large scale structure to estimate the model's
parameters and test the goodness of the fits. We explore the parameter space of
the model with nested sampling to find the best-fit chi-square, obtain the
Bayesian evidence, and compute the marginalized posteriors and mean
likelihoods. We mainly focus on a class of sub-models with no explicit
cosmological constant (or vacuum energy) term to assess the ability of the
theory to dynamically cause a late-time accelerated expansion. The model
behaves as standard gravity without a cosmological constant at early times,
with an emergent extra contribution to the energy density that converges to a
cosmological constant in the far future. The model can in most cases yield very
good fits and is in perfect agreement with the data. This is because many
points in the parameter space of the model exist that give rise to
time-evolution equations that are effectively very similar to those of the
$\Lambda$CDM. This similarity makes the model compatible with observations as
in the $\Lambda$CDM case, at least at the background level. Even though our
results indicate a slightly better fit for the $\Lambda$CDM concordance model
in terms of the $p$-value and evidence, none of the models is statistically
preferred to the other. However, the parameters of the bigravity model are in
general degenerate. A similar but perturbative analysis of the model as well as
more data will be required to break the degeneracies and constrain the
parameters, in case the model will still be viable compared to the
$\Lambda$CDM.

galaxies. We confirm the complex nature of the mass distribution of the lensing
cluster, with a bimodal distribution which deviates from the Chandra X-ray SB
distribution. The Einstein radius is estimated to be \theta_E=15.2"" \pm 0.5""
for the quasar redshift of z=2.197. We derive a radial mass distribution from
the combination of strong lensing, HST/ACS weak lensing, and Subaru/Suprime-cam
weak lensing analysis results, finding a best-fit virial mass of
M_vir=(1.5+0.40-0.35) \times 10^14 h^-1 M_sun and a concentration parameter of
c_vir=25.7+14.1-7.5. The lensing mass estimate at the outer radius is smaller
than the X-ray mass estimate by a factor of ~2. We ascribe this large mass
discrepancy to shock heating of the intracluster gas during a merger, which is
also suggested by the complex mass and gas distributions and the high value of
the concentration parameter. In the HST image, we also identify a probable
galaxy, GX, in the vicinity of the faintest quasar image C. The inclusion of GX
explains the anomalous flux ratios between the quasar images. The morphology of
the highly elongated quasar host galaxy is also well reproduced. The best-fit
model suggests large total magnifications of 30 for the quasar and 35 for the
quasar host galaxy, and has an AB time delay consistent with the measured
value. (Abridged)

photoionization heating, stellar winds, and supernovae (SNe), we make
predictions for the dense molecular gas tracers as a function of GMC and galaxy

L_HCN/L_CO(1-0) ratios order-of-magnitude larger than observed. By contrast,
models with feedback properties taken directly from stellar evolution
calculations predict dense gas tracers in good agreement with observations.
Changing the strength or timing of SNe tends to move systems along, rather than
off, the L_HCN-L_CO relation (because SNe heat lower-density material, not the
high-density gas). Changing the strength of radiation pressure (which acts
efficiently in the highest density gas), however, has a much stronger effect on
L_HCN than on L_CO. We predict that the fraction of dense gas (L_HCN/L_CO(1-0))
increases with increasing GMC surface density; this drives a trend in
L_HCN/L_CO(1-0) with SFR and luminosity which has tentatively been observed.
Our results make specific predictions for enhancements in the dense gas tracers

(CDM) on small scales. An accurate theoretical modelling of their effect during
the non-linear regime of structure formation is required in order to properly
analyse current and upcoming high-precision large-scale structure data, and
constrain the neutrino mass. Taking advantage of the fact that massive
neutrinos remain linearly clustered up to late times, this paper treats the
linear growth of neutrino overdensities in a non-linear CDM background. The
evolution of the CDM component is obtained via N-body computations. The smooth
neutrino component is evaluated from that background by solving the Boltzmann
equation linearised with respect to the neutrino overdensity. CDM and neutrinos
are simultaneously evolved in time, consistently accounting for their mutual
gravitational influence. This method avoids the issue of shot-noise inherent to
particle-based neutrino simulations, and, in contrast with standard
Fourier-space methods, properly accounts for the non-linear potential wells in
which the neutrinos evolve. Inside the most massive late-time clusters, where
the escape velocity is larger than the neutrino thermal velocity, neutrinos can
clump non-linearly, causing the method to formally break down. It is shown that
this does not affect the total matter power spectrum, which can be very
accurately computed on all relevant scales up to the present time.

objects in the Chameleon I star-forming region which is based on ~300 high
resolution optical spectra from the multi-object fibre spectrograph
FLAMES/GIRAFFE at the ESO/VLT. Twenty five objects with spectral types from
G2-M5.75 were observed 12 times over the course of 15 months. Using the
emission lines Ha (6562.81 A) and Ca II (8662.1 A) as accretion indicators we
found 10 accreting and 15 non-accreting objects. We derived accretion rates for
all accretors in the sample using the Ha equivalent width, Ha 10% width and the
CaII equivalent width. The mean amplitude of variations in derived accretion
rate from Ha equivalent width was ~ 0.37 dex, from Ca II equivalent width ~0.83
dex and from Ha 10% width ~1.11 dex. Based on the large amplitude of variations
in accretion rates derived from the Ha 10% width with respect to the other
diagnostics, we do not consider it to be a reliable accretion rate estimator.
Taking the variations in Ha equivalent width and CaII equivalent width
accretion rates to be closer to the true value, they suggest that the spread
which has been found around the accretion rate to stellar mass relation is not
due to the variability of individual objects on time-scales of weeks to ~1
year. From these variations we can also infer that the accretion rates are
stable within < 0.37 dex over time-scales of less than 15 months. A major
portion of the accretion variability was found to occur on less than the
shortest time-scales in our observations, 8-25 days, which is comparable with
the rotation periods of these young stellar objects. This could be an
indication that what we are probing is spatial structure in the accretion
flows, and also suggests that observations on time-scales of ~a couple of weeks
are sufficient to limit the total extent of accretion rate variations in
typical young stars.

to their host dark-matter haloes and subhaloes ('HASH'), where each galaxy
resides in a subhalo taken from a large N-body cosmological simulation. This
approach allows us to study the mass relation between subhaloes and galaxies
(MR) using: the weak lensing signal (WL), the two point auto-correlation
function (CF), and the stellar mass function of galaxies (SMF). Our method is
based on modeling the lensing signal directly from the cosmological simulation,
and should thus be more accurate than other methods based on analytic halo
models. We find that the WL does not provide a strong constraint on the MR,
allowing for more than a factor of 10 freedom in the subhalo mass of central
galaxies, for a given stellar mass. The freedom for satellite galaxies is much
larger, providing a very poor constraint on the fraction of satellite galaxies
(0.05-0.8). These results are not significantly modified when using both the
SMF and WL as constraints. We show that for the most massive galaxies,
observational constraints based on the CF with 0.1 dex errors, are equivalent
to 0.05 dex error in the WL. For intermediate and low mass galaxies the WL and
CF constrain the MR in a different way. Although the WL is currently not adding
much information at these masses, it has the potential of being important using
future, more accurate measurements. The models found here do not match
simultaneously the observed CF and WL signals, and show a limited ability to
match the WL & SMF. We suspect that this is partially due to the cosmological
model assumed here and we therefore adopt a mock WL signal through most of this
work. In comparison to previous models in the literature, the method presented
here is probably more general, as it reveals a larger range of solutions for a
given set of observational constraints [abridged].

mechanism that restores the inertial mass to its standard value. As a
consequence, the dynamics of gravitational clustering are modified. Two

disks containing dead zones or gaps due to disk-planet interaction, may be
subject to the non-axisymmetric Rossby wave instability (RWI) that lead to
vortex-formation. The linear instability has recently been demonstrated in
three-dimensional (3D) barotropic disks. It is the purpose of this study to
generalize the 3D linear problem to include an energy equation, thereby
accounting for baroclinity in three-dimensions. Linear stability calculations
are presented for radially structured, vertically stratified,
geometrically-thin disks with non-uniform entropy distribution in both
directions. Polytropic equilibria are considered but adiabatic perturbations
assumed. The unperturbed disk has a localized radial density bump making it
susceptible to the RWI. The linearized fluid equations are solved numerically
as a partial differential equation eigenvalue problem. Emphasis on the ease of
method implementation is given. It is found that when the polytropic index is
fixed and adiabatic index increased, non-uniform entropy has negligible effect
on the RWI growth rate, but pressure and density perturbation magnitudes near a
pressure enhancement increases away from the midplane. The associated
meridional flow is also qualitatively changed from homentropic calculations.
Meridional vortical motion is identified in the nonhomentropic linear solution,
as well as in a nonlinear global hydrodynamic simulation of the RWI in an
initially isothermal disk evolved adiabatically. Numerical results suggest
buoyancy forces play an important role in the internal flow of Rossby vortices.

$\cos\theta_W\to 1$ all the masses would become equal $m_Z=m_W=m_t=m_H$.
  We review the theoretical situation of this ratio in the SM and beyond. In
the SM these relations are rather stable under RGE pointing out to some
underlying UV symmetry. In the SM such a ratio hints for a non-casual relation
of the type $\lambda \simeq \kappa \left (g^2+{g'}{}^2\right )$ with
$\kappa\simeq 1+o(g/g_t)$. Moreover the existence of relations $m_i/m_j \simeq
f_{ij}(\theta_W)$ could be interpreted as a hint for a role of the $SU(2)_c$
custodial symmetry, together with other unknown mechanism. % Without a symmetry
at hand to explain then in the SM, it arises a Higgs mass coincidence problem,
why the ratios $\rho_t,\rho_{Wt}$ are so close to one, can we find a mechanism

interactions, bar instabilities, morphologies and the presence of AGN in
regulating star formation efficiency. Both the H2 mass fraction and depletion
time vary as a function of the distance of a galaxy from the main sequence in
the SFR-M* plane. The longest gas depletion times are found in below-main
sequence bulge-dominated galaxies that are either gas-poor, or else on average
less efficient than disk-dominated galaxy at converting into stars any cold gas
they may have. We find no link between AGN and these long depletion times. The
galaxies undergoing mergers or showing signs of morphological disruptions have
the shortest molecular gas depletion times, while those hosting strong stellar
bars have only marginally higher global star formation efficiencies as compared
to matched control samples. Our interpretation is that depletion time
variations are caused by changes in the ratio between the gas mass traced by
the CO(1-0) observations, and the gas mass in high density star-forming cores,
with interactions, mergers and bar instabilities able to locally increase
pressure and raise the ratio of efficiently star-forming gas to CO-detected
gas. Building a sample representative of the local massive galaxy population,
we derive a global Kennicutt-Schmidt relation of slope 1.18+/-0.24, and observe
structure within the scatter around this relation, with galaxies having low
(high) stellar mass surface densities lying systematically above (below) the
mean relation, suggesting that gas surface density is not the only parameter
driving the global star formation ability of a galaxy.

the SDSS becomes significantly incomplete at M_{BH} < 3 x 10^8 M_{Sun} or L /

number densities are flat at z < 2. We estimate the maximum Eddington ratio of
Type 1 quasars in the observable Universe to be L / L_{Edd} ~ 3. Consistent
with our results in Paper I, we do not find statistical evidence for a
so-called ""sub-Eddington boundary"" in the mass-luminosity plane of broad line
quasars, and demonstrate that such an apparent boundary in the observed
distribution can be caused by selection effect and errors in virial BH mass
estimates. Based on the typical Eddington ratio in a given mass bin, we
estimate typical growth times for the black holes in Type 1 quasars and find
that they are typically comparable to or longer than the age of the universe,
implying an earlier phase of accelerated (i.e., with higher Eddington ratios)
and possibly obscured growth. The large masses probed by our sample imply that
most of our black holes reside in what are locally early type galaxies, and we
interpret our results within the context of models of self-regulated black hole

2123-463 was not reported in the Second Fermi-LAT source catalog. On 2011
December 14 a gamma-ray source positionally consistent with PKS 2123-463 was
detected in flaring activity by Fermi-LAT. This activity triggered
radio-to-X-ray observations by the Swift, GROND, ATCA, Ceduna, and KAT-7
observatories. Results of the localization of the gamma-ray source over 41
months of Fermi-LAT operation are reported here in conjunction with the results
of the analysis of radio, optical, UV and X-ray data collected soon after the

  The strict spatial association with the lower energy counterpart together
with a simultaneous increase of the activity in optical, UV, X-ray and
gamma-ray bands led to a firm identification of the gamma-ray source with PKS

spectroscopic redshift of z = 1.67. We fit the broadband spectral energy
distribution with a synchrotron/external Compton model. We find that a thermal
disk component is necessary to explain the optical/UV emission detected by
Swift/UVOT. This disk has a luminosity of about 1.8x10^46 erg/s, and a fit to
the disk emission assuming a Schwarzschild (i.e., nonrotating) black hole gives

ion-gating structures. This method, however, introduces large dead times and
restricts trigger rates to a few hundred per second. The ion gate can be
eliminated from the setup by the use of Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) foils for
gas amplification, which intrinsically suppress the backflow of ions. This
makes the continuous operation of a TPC at high rates feasible.
  In this work, Monte Carlo simulations of the buildup of ion space charge in a
GEM-based TPC and the correction of the resulting drift distortions are
discussed, based on realistic numbers for the ion backflow in a triple-GEM
amplification stack. A TPC in the future PANDA experiment at FAIR, in which
antiproton-proton interaction rates up to 2 x 10^7 per second will be reached,
serves as an example for the experimental environment. The simulations show
that space charge densities up to 65 fC per cubic cm are reached, leading to
electron drift distortions of up to 10 mm. The application of a laser
calibration system to correct these distortions is investigated. Based on full
simulations of the detector physics and response, we show that it is possible
to correct for the drift distortions and to maintain the good momentum
resolution of the GEM-TPC.

optimization problem very delicate. The large amount of parameters to be taken
into account paves the way for a useful mathematical modeling. Due to the
heterogeneity of raceways along the depth dimension regarding temperature,
light intensity or nutrients availability, we adopt a multilayer approach for
hydrodynamics and biology. For free surface hydrodynamics, we use a multilayer
Saint-Venant model that allows mass exchanges, forced by a simplified
representation of the paddlewheel. Then, starting from an improved Droop model
that includes light effect on algae growth, we derive a similar multilayer
system for the biological part. A kinetic interpretation of the whole system
results in an efficient numerical scheme. We show through numerical simulations
in two dimensions that our approach is capable of discriminating between
situations of mixed water or calm and heterogeneous pond. Moreover, we exhibit
that a posteriori treatment of our velocity fields can provide lagrangian
trajectories which are of great interest to assess the actual light pattern
perceived by the algal cells and therefore understand its impact on the

applications and services on mobile devices. A wide range of research has
exploited context dependency, i.e., the relations between context(s) and the
outcome, to achieve significant, quantified, performance gains for a variety of
applications. These works often have to deal with the challenges of multiple
sources of context that can lead to a sparse training data set, and the
challenge of energy hungry context sensors. Often, they address these
challenges in an application specific and ad-hoc manner. We liberate mobile
application designers and researchers from these burdens by providing a
methodical approach to these challenges. In particular, we 1) define and
measure the context-dependency of three fundamental types of mobile usage in an
application agnostic yet practical manner, which can provide clear insight into
the performance of potential ap-plication. 2) Address the challenge of data
sparseness when dealing with multiple and different sources of context in a
systematic manner. 3) Present SmartContext to address the energy challenge by
automatically selecting among context sources while ensuring the minimum
accuracy for each estimation event is met.
  Our analysis and findings are based on usage and context traces collected in
real-life settings from 24 iPhone users over a period of one year. We present
findings regarding the context dependency of the three principal types of
mobile usage; visited websites, phone calls, and app usage. Yet, our
methodology and the lessons we learn can be readily extended to other
context-dependent mobile usage and system resources as well. Our findings guide
the development of context aware systems, and highlight the challenges and
expectations regarding the context dependency of mobile usage.

monotonically increase the density of the coding opportunities in instantly
decodable network coding (IDNC).Using the well-known graph representation of
IDNC, first derive an expression for the exact evolution of the edge set size
after the transmission of any arbitrary coded packet. From the derived
expressions, we show that sending commonly wanted packets for all the receivers
can maximize the number of coding opportunities. Since guaranteeing such
property in IDNC is usually impossible, this strategy does not guarantee the
achievement of our target. Consequently, we further investigate the problem by
deriving the expectation of the edge set size evolution after ignoring the
identities of the packets requested by the different receivers and considering
only their numbers. We then employ this expected expression to show that
serving the maximum number of receivers having the largest numbers of missing
packets and erasure probabilities tends to both maximize and monotonically
increase the expected density of coding opportunities. Simulation results
justify our theoretical findings. Finally, we validate the importance of our
work through two case studies showing that our identified strategy outperforms
the step-by-step service maximization solution in optimizing both the IDNC

technique. We obtained a closed-form Landauer expression for the transmission
coefficient of the SQDC system with arbitrary number of QDs by using the method
beyond mean-field theory. The electrical conductance ($G_e$), Seebeck
coefficient (S), thermal conductance, and figure of merit (ZT) are numerically
calculated and analyzed in the linear response regime. When thermal conductance
is dominated by phonon carriers, the optimization of ZT is determined by the
power factor ($pF=S^2G_e$). We find that the optimization of ZT value favors
the following conditions:(1) QDs with low energy level fluctuations, (2) QD
energy levels lie above the Fermi level of electrodes, (3) $\Gamma < t_c \ll
U_0$, where $t_c$, $U_0$, and $\Gamma$ are electron interdot hopping strength,
on-site electron Coulomb interaction, and tunneling rate, respectively, and (4)
$\Gamma_L=\Gamma_R$ with $\Gamma_L+\Gamma_R$ kept constant, where $\Gamma_L
(\Gamma_R)$ is the left (right) tunneling rate. It is predicted that high ZT
values can be achieved by tailoring above conditions.

are assembled. Both the baryonic and stellar Tully-Fisher relations for gas
disc-dominated systems are tight while, as more dispersion-dominated systems
are included, the scatter increases. We found a clear correlation between
$\sigma / V_{\rm rot}$ and morphology, with dispersion-dominated systems
exhibiting the larger values ($> 0.7$). Mergers and interactions can affect the
rotation curves directly or indirectly inducing a scatter in the Tully-Fisher
Relation larger than the simulated evolution since $z \sim 3$. Kinematical
indicators which combine rotation velocity and dispersion velocity can reduce
the scatter in the baryonic and the stellar mass-velocity relations. Our
findings also show that the lowest scatter in both relations is obtained if the
velocity indicators are measured at the maximum of the rotation curve.
Moreover, the rotation velocity estimated at the maximum of the gas rotation

However, studies in combinatorial optimisation and search have shown a clear
advantage of using variable mutation rates as a control parameter to optimise

is based on Ronald Fisher's work, who used Euclidean geometry to study the
relation between mutation size and expected fitness of the offspring in
infinite phenotypic spaces. Here we reconsider this theory based on the
alternative geometry of discrete and finite spaces of DNA sequences. First, we
consider the geometric case of fitness being isomorphic to distance from an
optimum, and show how problems of optimal mutation rate control can be solved
exactly or approximately depending on additional constraints of the problem.
Then we consider the general case of fitness communicating only partial
information about the distance. We define weak monotonicity of fitness
landscapes and prove that this property holds in all landscapes that are
continuous and open at the optimum. This theoretical result motivates our
hypothesis that optimal mutation rate functions in such landscapes will
increase when fitness decreases in some neighbourhood of an optimum, resembling
the control functions derived in the geometric case. We test this hypothesis
experimentally by analysing approximately optimal mutation rate control
functions in 115 complete landscapes of binding scores between DNA sequences
and transcription factors. Our findings support the hypothesis and find that
the increase of mutation rate is more rapid in landscapes that are less
monotonic (more rugged). We discuss the relevance of these findings to living

bins of redshift, rest-frame wavelength, black hole mass, Eddington ratio and
bolometric luminosity respectively, to investigate the relationships between
variability and these parameters. An anti-correlation between variability and
rest-frame wavelength is found. The variability amplitude of radio-quiet
quasars shows almost no cosmological evolution, but that of radio-loud ones may
weakly anti-correlate with redshift. In addition, variability increases as
either luminosity or Eddington ratio decreases. However, the relationship
between variability and black hole mass is uncertain; it is negative when the
influence of Eddington ratio is excluded, but positive when the influence of
luminosity is excluded. The intrinsic distribution of variability amplitudes
for radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars are different. Both radio-loud and
radio-quiet quasars exhibit a bluer-when-brighter chromatism. Assuming that
quasar variability is caused by variations of accretion rate, the
Shakura-Sunyaev disk model can reproduce the tendencies of observed
correlations between variability and rest-frame wavelength, luminosity as well
as Eddington ratio, supporting that changes of accretion rate plays an
important role in producing the observed optical variability. However, the
predicted positive correlation between variability and black hole mass seems to
be inconsistent with the observed negative correlation between them in small

still need to be considered in modifying the simple accretion disk model.

and the Vlasov equation, it is very convenient to use the moment expansion in
the NRxx method to approximate the distribution function in the Vlasov
equations. The moment closure recently presented in [5] is applied to achieve
the globally hyperbolicity so that the local well-posedness of the moment
system is attained. This makes our simulations using high order moment
expansion accessible in the case of the distribution far away from the

With the moment expansion of the distribution function, the acceleration in the
velocity space results in an ordinary differential system of the macroscopic
velocity, thus is easy to be handled. The numerical method we developed can
keep both the mass and the momentum conserved. We carry out the simulations of
both the Vlasov-Poisson equations and the Vlasov-Poisson-BGK equations to study
the linear Landau damping. The numerical convergence is exhibited in terms of
the moment number and the spatial grid size, respectively. The variation of
discretized energy as well as the dependence of the recurrence time on moment
order is investigated. The linear Landau damping is well captured for different
wave numbers and collision frequencies. We find that the Landau damping rate
linearly and monotonically converges in the spatial grid size. The results are
in perfect agreement with the theoretic data in the collisionless case.

Rev. Sci. Instrum. 82, 053906 (2011)]. Here, we describe methods to generate
pressures above 10 GPa in the mCAC. The efficiency of the pressure generation
is sharply improved when the Cu-Be gasket is sufficiently preindented. The
maximum pressure for the 0.6 mm culet anvils is 12.6 GPa when the Cu-Be gasket
is preindented from the initial thickness of 0.30 to 0.06 mm. The 0.5 mm culet
anvils were also tested with a rhenium gasket. The maximum pressure attainable
in the mCAC is about 13 GPa. The present cell was used to study YbCu2Si2 which
shows a pressure induced transition from the non-magnetic to magnetic phases at
8 GPa. We confirm a ferromagnetic transition from the dc magnetization
measurement at high pressure. The mCAC can detect the ferromagnetic ordered
state whose spontaneous magnetic moment is smaller than 1 mB per unit cell. The
high sensitivity for magnetic measurements in the mCAC may result from the the
simplicity of cell structure. The present study shows the availability of the
mCAC for precise magnetic measurements at pressures above 10 GPa.

superinsulation. We show that this duality realizes in the planar Josephson

superinsulation. We find that in disordered superconducting films that are on
the brink of superconductor-insulator transition the Coulomb forces between the

energy depends logarithmically upon charge separation, bringing the same
vortex-charge-BKT transition duality, and realization of superinsulation in
disordered films as the low-temperature charge-BKT state. Finally, we discuss
possible applications and utilizations of superconductivity-superinsulation

$\gamma$-ray bands, Mrk 501 is very useful for physics associated with jets

TeV since November 2007. Starting from October 2011 the largest flare since
2005 is observed, which lasts to about April 2012. In this paper, a detailed
analysis is reported. During the brightest $\gamma$-rays flaring episodes from
October 17 to November 22, 2011, an excess of the event rate over 6 $\sigma$ is
detected by ARGO-YBJ in the direction of Mrk 501, corresponding to an increase
of the $\gamma$-ray flux above 1 TeV by a factor of 6.6$\pm$2.2 from its steady
emission. In particular, the $\gamma$-ray flux above 8 TeV is detected with a
significance better than 4 $\sigma$. Based on time-dependent synchrotron
self-Compton (SSC) processes, the broad-band energy spectrum is interpreted as
the emission from an electron energy distribution parameterized with a single
power-law function with an exponential cutoff at its high energy end. The
average spectral energy distribution for the steady emission is well described
by this simple one-zone SSC model. However, the detection of $\gamma$-rays
above 8 TeV during the flare challenges this model due to the hardness of the
spectra. Correlations between X-rays and $\gamma$-rays are also investigated.

Firstly a classical steepest descent (SD) algorithm in multi-dimensional

based on this manifold with lower dimensions. Moreover, aiming at further
reducing the complexity, Grassmann manifold is introduced to derive

estimator (MLE) and smoothed maximum likelihood estimator (SMLE) of the unknown

For the bivariate current status and interval censoring models distribution
theory of this type is still absent and even the rate at which we can expect
reasonable estimators to converge is unknown. We define a purely discrete
plug-in estimator of the distribution function which locally converges at rate
n^{1/3} and derive its (normal) limit distribution. Unlike the MLE or SMLE,
this estimator is not a proper distribution function. Since the estimator is
purely discrete, it demonstrates that the n^{1/3} convergence rate is in
principle possible for the MLE, but whether this actually holds for the MLE is
still an open problem. If the cube root n rate holds for the MLE, this would
mean that the local 1-dimensional rate of the MLE continues to hold in
dimension 2, a (perhaps) somewhat surprising result. The simulation results do
not seem to be in contradiction with this assumption, however. We compare the
behavior of the plug-in estimator with the behavior of the MLE on a sieve and
the SMLE in a simulation study. This indicates that the plug-in estimator and
the SMLE have a smaller variance but a larger bias than the sieved MLE. The
SMLE is conjectured to have a n^{1/3}-rate of convergence if we use bandwidths
of order n^{-1/6}. We derive its (normal) limit distribution, using this
assumption. Finally, we demonstrate the behavior of the MLE and SMLE for the
bivariate interval censored data of [1], which have been discussed by many
authors, see e.g., [18], [3], [2] and [15].

tune the beam polarization to obtain close to zero polarization over most of

steeper than the magnetic ones at the sub-granular scale in the internetwork

the magnetic power spectra are close to or smaller than -1 at that scale, which
suggests the total magnetic energy mainly comes from either the granular scale
magnetic structures or both the granular scale and smaller ones contributing
evenly. The slopes of the thermal and kinetic power spectra become less steep

  4, No. 2, pp. 117-134, 2012",,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Routing in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) has been an active area of research
for the last several years. In this paper, we address the problem of packet
routing for efficient data forwarding in wireless mesh networks (WMNs) with the
help of smart ants acting as intelligent agents. The aim of this paper is to
study the use of such biologically inspired agents to effectively route the
packets in WMNs. In particular, we propose AntMesh, a distributed
interference-aware data forwarding algorithm which enables the use of smart
ants to probabilistically and concurrently perform the routing and data
forwarding in order to stochastically solve a dynamic network routing problem.
AntMesh belongs to the class of routing algorithms inspired by the behaviour of
real ants which are known to find a shortest path between their nest and a food
source. In addition, AntMesh has the capability to effectively utilize the
space/channel diversity typically common in multi radio WMNs and to discover
high throughput paths with less inter-flow and intra-flow interference while
conventional wireless network routing protocols fail to do so. We implement our
smart ant-based routing algorithm in ns-2 and carry out extensive evaluation.
We demonstrate the stability of AntMesh in terms of how quickly it adapts
itself to the changing dynamics or load on the network. We tune the parameters
of AntMesh algorithm to study the effect on its performance in terms of the
routing load and end-to-end delay and have tested its performance under various
network scenarios particularly fixed nodes mesh networks and also on mobile WMN
scenarios. The results obtained show AntMesh's advantages that make it a
valuable candidate to operate in mesh networks.

carried out at four different frequencies using the Giant Meterwave Radio
telescope (325 and 610 MHz), the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (1420

estimated at all four observed frequencies, which suggest similar degree of
nulling across these frequencies. To comment on the broadband behaviour of
pulse nulling, we calculated the Pearson cross-correlation coefficients for the
occurrence of null and burst pulses between all four frequencies. We conclude
that nulling is largely a broadband phenomenon for this pulsar and it points
towards a global failure of the magnetospheric currents which produces radio

introduce a redshift dependent magnitude offset to standard candle sources.
This would lead to overestimated luminosity distances compared to a dust-free

Type Ia supernovae observations. In this paper, we model the optical extinction
and X-ray scattering properties of intergalactic dust grains to constrain the
intergalactic opacity using a combined analysis of observed quasar colours and
the soft X-ray background. Quasar colours effectively constrain the amount of
intergalactic dust grains smaller than ~0.2 microns, to the point where we
expect the corresponding systematic error in the Type Ia supernova
magnitude-redshift relation to be sub-dominant. Soft X-ray background
observations are helpful in improving the constraints on very large dust grains
for which the amount of optical reddening is very small and therefore is more
difficult to correct for. Our current upper limit corresponds to ~0.25
magnitude dimming at optical wavelengths for a source at redshift z = 1, which
is too small to alleviate the need for dark energy but large in terms of
relative error. However, we expect it to be possible to lower this bound
considerably with an improved understanding of the possible sources of the
X-ray background, in combination with observations of compact X-ray sources

century to watch the passage of Venus across the solar disk from Earth. Venus
transits have traditionally provided unique insight into the Venus atmosphere
through the refraction halo that appears at the planet outer terminator near
ingress/egress. Much more recently, Venus transits have attracted renewed
interest because the technique of transits is being successfully applied to the
characterization of extrasolar planet atmospheres. The current work
investigates theoretically the interaction of sunlight and the Venus atmosphere
through the full range of transit phases, as observed from Earth and from a
remote distance. Our model predictions quantify the relevant atmospheric
phenomena, thereby assisting the observers of the event in the interpretation
of measurements and the extrapolation to the exoplanet case. Our approach
relies on the numerical integration of the radiative transfer equation, and
includes refraction, multiple scattering, atmospheric extinction and solar limb
darkening, as well as an up to date description of the Venus atmosphere. We
produce synthetic images of the planet terminator during ingress/egress that
demonstrate the evolving shape, brightness and chromaticity of the halo.
Guidelines are offered for the investigation of the planet upper haze from
vertically-unresolved photometric measurements. In this respect, the comparison
with measurements from the 2004 transit appears encouraging. We also show
integrated lightcurves of the Venus/Sun system at various phases during transit
and calculate the respective Venus-Sun integrated transmission spectra. The
comparison of the model predictions to those for a Venus-like planet free of
haze and clouds (and therefore a closer terrestrial analogue) complements the
discussion and sets the conclusions into a broader perspective.

structures often described as flux tubes (FTs) and sheets (FSs). 3-D radiative
transfer (RT) is important for energy transport in these concentrations. It is
also expected to be important for diagnostic purposes but has rarely been
applied for that purpose. Using true 3-D, non-LTE (NLTE) RT in FT/FS models, we
compute Fe line profiles commonly used to diagnose the Sun's magnetic field by
comparing the results with those obtained from LTE/1-D (1.5-D) NLTE
calculations. Employing a multilevel iron atom, we study the influence of basic
parameters such as Wilson depression, wall thickness, radius/width, thermal
stratification or magnetic field strength on all Stokes $I$ parameters in the
thin-tube approximation. The use of different levels of approximations of RT
may lead to considerable differences in profile shapes, intensity contrasts,
equivalent widths, and the determination of magnetic field strengths. In
particular, LTE, which often provides a good approach in planar 1-D
atmospheres, is a poor approximation in our flux sheet model for some of the
most important diagnostic Fe I lines (524.7nm, 525.0nm, 630.1nm, and 630.2nm).
The observed effects depend on parameters such as the height of line formation,
field strength, and internal temperature stratification. Differences between
the profile shapes may lead to errors in the determination of magnetic fields
on the order of 10 to 20%, while errors in the determined temperature can reach
300-400K. The empirical FT models NET and PLA turn out to minimize the effects
of 3D RT, so that results obtained with these models by applying LTE may also
remain valid for 3-D NLTE calculations. Finally, horizontal RT is found to only
insignificantly smear out structures such as the optically thick walls of FTs
and FSs, allowing features as narrow as 10km to remain visible.

in metal abundance does not end at high redshift. Evolution is established with

microscopic width $\xi>0$; its influence is erased by thermal fluctuations at
sufficiently high temperatures, but turns out to be a crucial ingredient for
the description of the interface fluctuations below a characteristic
temperature $T_c(\xi)$. Exploiting the exact mapping between the static 1D
interface and a 1+1 Directed Polymer (DP) growing in a continuous space, we
study analytically both the free-energy and geometrical fluctuations of a DP,
at finite temperature $T$, with a short-range elasticity and submitted to a
quenched random-bond Gaussian disorder of finite correlation length $\xi$.
  We derive the exact `time'-evolution equations of the disorder free-energy
$\bar{F}(t,y)$, its derivative $\eta (t,y)$, and their respective two-point
correlators $\bar{C}(t,y)$ and $\bar{R}(t,y)$. We compute the exact solution of
its linearized evolution $\bar{R}^{lin}(t,y)$, and we combine its qualitative
behavior and the asymptotic properties known for an uncorrelated disorder
($\xi=0$), to construct a `toymodel' leading to a simple description of the DP.
This model is characterized by Brownian-like free-energy fluctuations,
correlated at small $|y|<\xi$, of amplitude $\tilde{D}_{\infty}(T,\xi)$. We
present an extended scaling analysis of the roughness predicting
$\tilde{D}_{\infty} \sim 1/T$ at high-temperatures and $\tilde{D}_{\infty} \sim
1/T_c(\xi)$ at low-temperatures. We identify the connection between the
temperature-induced crossover and the full replica-symmetry breaking in
previous Gaussian Variational Method computations. Finally we discuss the
consequences of the low-temperature regime for two experimental realizations of
KPZ interfaces, namely the static and quasistatic behavior of magnetic domain
walls and the high-velocity steady-state dynamics of interfaces in liquid

approximate Bayesian inference, based on sequential decoding methods.
Reliability information about subkey hypotheses is generated in the form of
likelihoods, and sets of subkey hypothesis likelihoods are optimally combined
into key bit log likelihood ratios. The redundancy of expanded keys in
multi-round cryptographic schemes is exploited to correct round key estimation
errors. This is achieved by sequential decoding, where subkey candidates are
sorted by a probabilistic path metric and iteratively extended. The M-algorithm
is presented as a concrete implementation example with deterministic run-time
behaviour. The resulting algorithm contains previous hard decision differential
analysis as special case for single-round analysis and M=1, and is strictly
more accurate otherwise. The trade-off between estimation accuracy and
complexity is scalable by parameter choice. The proposed algorithm is
simulatively shown in an example scenario to reduce the number of required side
channel traces compared to standard differential analysis by a factor of two
when run with reasonable complexity, for the whole investigated signal-to-noise

activating a second species which acts as its own repressor, is widely found in
biological systems, in particular in genetic systems with inherent oscillatory
behavior. Here we consider a specific realization of this motif as a genetic
circuit, in which genes are described as directly producing proteins, leaving
out the intermediate step of mRNA production. We focus on the effect that
inherent time scales on the underlying fine-grained scale can have on the
bifurcation patterns on a coarser scale in time. Time scales are set by the
binding and unbinding rates of the transcription factors to the promoter
regions of the genes. Depending on the ratio of these rates to the decay times
of the proteins, the appropriate averaging procedure for obtaining a
coarse-grained description changes and leads to sets of deterministic
equations, which differ in their bifurcation structure. In particular the
desired intermediate range of regular limit cycles fades away when the binding
rates of genes are of the same order or less than the decay time of at least
one of the proteins. Our analysis illustrates that the common topology of the

remnants via diffusive shock acceleration. Despite the popularity of this idea,
a conclusive proof for its validity is still missing. Gamma-ray astronomy
provides us with a powerful tool to tackle this problem, because gamma rays are
produced during cosmic ray interactions with the ambient gas. The detection of
gamma rays from several supernova remnants is encouraging, but still does not
constitute a proof of the scenario, the main problem being the difficulty in
disentangling the hadronic and leptonic contributions to the emission. Once
released by their sources, cosmic rays diffuse in the interstellar medium, and
finally escape from the Galaxy. The diffuse gamma-ray emission from the
Galactic disk, as well as the gamma-ray emission detected from a few galaxies
is largely due to the interactions of cosmic rays in the interstellar medium.
On much larger scales, cosmic rays are also expected to permeate the
intracluster medium, since they can be confined and accumulated within clusters
of galaxies for cosmological times. Thus, the detection of gamma rays from
clusters of galaxies, or even upper limits on their emission, will allow us to
constrain the cosmic ray output of the sources they contain, such as normal
galaxies, AGNs, and cosmological shocks. In this paper, we describe the impact
that the Cherenkov Telescope Array, a future ground-based facility for
very-high energy gamma-ray astronomy, is expected to have in this field of

their orbital motions throughout time; this is accompanied by changes in the
anisotropy parameter, measuring the relative importance of radial and
tangential motions for a given class of objects. Along with orbital changes,
galaxies in clusters are well known to undergo severe alteration in their
hot/cold gas content and star formation properties. Understanding the link
between the changes in the internal properties of galaxies and their orbital
motion is of crucial importance in the study of galaxy evolution, as it could
unveil the primary mechanism responsible for its environmental dependence. Do
the changes in the internal properties happen in parallel with those in the
orbital motion? Or are the orbital features at the time of infall what
determines the fate of the member galaxies? Alternatively: are the properties
of galaxies at a given time related to the coeval orbital anisotropy or are
they better related to the anisotropy at infall? In order to answer these
questions, we studied the orbital evolution of different galaxy populations in
the semi-analytic models of Guo et al. (2011) applied on to the Millennium
Simulation. For each class of objects, characterised by different internal
properties (such as age, star formation rate and colour), we studied the
anisotropy profile at redshift zero and its evolution by tracing the
progenitors back in time. We conclude that the orbital properties at infall
strongly influence the subsequent evolution of the internal features of
galaxies and that the overall anisotropy of the galaxy population tends to
increase with time.

the gas and its diagnostics is of fundamental importance in order to achieve a
detailed description of the thermal and chemical structure of the disk. The
radiation from the central star (from optical to X-ray wavelengths) and viscous
accretion are the main source of energy and dominates the disk physics and
chemistry in its early stages. This is the environment in which the first
phases of planet formation will proceed. We investigate how stellar and disk
parameters impact the fine-structure cooling lines [NeII], [ArII], [OI], [CII]
and H2O rotational lines in the disk. These lines are potentially powerful
diagnostics of the disk structure and their modelling permits a thorough
interpretation of the observations carried out with instrumental facilities
such as Spitzer and Herschel. Following Aresu et al. (2011), we computed a grid
of 240 disk models, in which the X-ray luminosity, UV-excess luminosity,
minimum dust grain size, dust size distribution power law and surface density
distribution power law, are systematically varied. We solve self-consistently
for the disk vertical hydrostatic structure in every model and apply detailed
line radiative transfer to calculate line fluxes and profiles for a series of
well known mid- and far-infrared cooling lines. The [OI] 63 micron line flux
increases with increasing FUV luminosity when Lx < 1e30 erg/s, and with
increasing X-ray luminosity when LX > 1e30 erg/s. [CII] 157 micron is mainly
driven by FUV luminosity via C+ production, X-rays affect the line flux to a
lesser extent. [NeII] 12.8 micron correlates with X-rays; the line profile
emitted from the disk atmosphere shows a double-peaked component, caused by
emission in the static disk atmosphere, next to a high velocity double-peaked

identified periodic orbit with a very long period of several thousand advective
time units is found as a local dynamical attractor embedded in the stability
boundary between laminar and turbulent dynamics. Its dynamics captures both the
interplay of downstream oriented vortex pairs and streaks observed in numerous
shear flows as well as the energetic bursting that is characteristic for
boundary layers. By embedding the flow into a family of flows that interpolates
between plane Couette flow and the boundary layer we demonstrate that the
periodic orbit emerges in a saddle-node infinite-period (SNIPER) bifurcation of
two symmetry-related travelling wave solutions of plane Couette flow.
Physically, the long period is due to a slow streak instability which leads to
a violent breakup of a streak associated with the bursting and the reformation
of the streak at a different spanwise location. We show that the orbit is
structurally stable when varying both the Reynolds number and the domain size.

background from compact binary coalescences. We consider in our calculations
newly available observation-based neutron star and black hole mass
distributions and complete analytical waveforms that include post-Newtonian
amplitude corrections. Our results show that: (i) post-Newtonian effects cause
a small reduction in the GW background signal; (ii) below 100 Hz the background
depends primarily on the local coalescence rate $r_0$ and the average chirp
mass and is independent of the chirp mass distribution; (iii) the effects of
cosmic star formation rates and delay times between the formation and merger of
binaries are linear below 100 Hz and can be represented by a single parameter
within a factor of ~ 2; (iv) a simple power law model of the energy density
parameter $\Omega_{GW}(f) ~ f^{2/3}$ up to 50-100 Hz is sufficient to be used
as a search template for ground-based interferometers. In terms of the
detection prospects of the background signal, we show that: (i) detection (a
signal-to-noise ratio of 3) within one year of observation by the Advanced LIGO
detectors (H1-L1) requires a coalescence rate of $r_0 = 3 (0.2) Mpc^{-3}
Myr^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars (binary black holes); (ii) this limit on
$r_0$ could be reduced 3-fold for two co-located detectors, whereas the
currently proposed worldwide network of advanced instruments gives only ~ 30%
improvement in detectability; (iii) the improved sensitivity of the planned
Einstein Telescope allows not only confident detection of the background but
also the high frequency components of the spectrum to be measured. Finally we
show that sub-threshold binary neutron star merger events produce a strong
foreground, which could be an issue for future terrestrial stochastic searches
of primordial GWs.

heating in core- collapse supernovae. Our new approach is an extension of the
previous studies that employ spherically symmetric, steady, shocked accretion
flows together with the light bulb approximation. The latter has been widely
used in the supernova community for the phenomenological investigation of the
criteria for successful supernova explosions. In the present approach, on the
other hand, we get rid of the steady-state condition and take into account
shock wave motions instead. We have in mind the scenario that not the critical
luminosity but the critical fluctuation generated by hydrodynamical
instabilities such as SASI and neutrino-driven convection in the post-shock
region determines the onset of shock revival. After confirming that the new
approach indeed captures the dynamics of revived shock wave qualitatively, we
then apply the method to various initial conditions and find that there is a
critical fluctuation for shock revival, which can be well fit by the following
formula: f_crit ~ 0.8 * (M_in/1.4M_sun) * {1- (rsh/10^8cm)}, in which fcrit
denotes the critical pressure fluctuation normalized by the unperturbed
post-shock value. Min and rsh stand for the mass of the central compact object
and the shock radius, respectively. The critical fluctuation decreases with the
shock radius, whereas it increases with the mass of the central object. We
discuss the possible implications of our results for 3D effects on shock
revival, which is currently controversial in the supernova community.

field leads to the formation of new ground states and determines the energy
spectra of the collective elementary excitations appearing over these ground
states. In this review the main attention is given to the electron-hole systems
forming coplanar magnetoexcitons in the Bose-Einstein condensation(BEC) ground
state with the wave vector k=0, taking into account the excited Landau levels,
when the exciton-type elementary excitations coexist with the plasmon-type
oscillations. At the same time properties of the two-dimensional electron
gas(2DEG) spatially separated as in the case of double quantum wells(DQWs) from
the 2D hole gas under conditions of the fractional quantum Hall effect(FQHE)
are of great interest because they can influence the quantum states of the
coplanar magnetoexcitons when the distance between the DQW layers diminishes.
We also consider in this review the bilayer electron systems under conditions
of the FQHE with the one half filling factor for each layer and with the total
filling factor for two layers equal to unity because the coherence between the
electron states in two layers is equivalent to the formation of the quantum
Hall excitons(QHExs) in a coherent macroscopic state. The breaking of the
global gauge symmetry as well as of the continuous rotational symmetries leads
to the formation of the gapless Nambu-Goldstone(NG) modes while the breaking of
the local gauge symmetry gives rise to the Higgs phenomenon characterized by
the gapped branches of the energy spectrum. The conditions in which the
spontaneous coherence could appear in a system of indirect excitons in a double
quantum well structures are discussed. The experimental attempts to achieve
these conditions, the main results and the accumulated knowledge are reviewed.

wavelengths is a challenging task. Compared to the current systems, working in
the infrared, the more demanding requirements are the higher spatial resolution
and the greater correction bandwidth. In fact, the turbulence scale is shorter
and the parameter variation is faster. Typically, the former is not larger than
25 mm (projected on the secondary mirror) and the latter is 2 kHz, therefore
the actuator has to be more slender and faster than the current ones. With a
soft magnetic composite core, a dual-stator and a single-mover, VRALA, the
actuator discussed in this paper, attains unprecedented performances with a
negligible thermal impact. Pre-shaping the current required to deliver a given
stroke greatly simplifies the control system, whose output supplies the current
generator. As the inductance depends on the mover position, the electronics of
this generator, provided with an inductance measure circuit, works also as a
displacement sensor, supplying the control system with an accurate feed-back
signal. A preliminary prototype, built according to the several FEA

results of these checks, matching the design results in terms of power and

aspects of the QGP created in Heavy Ion Collisions at RHIC and LHC energies.
The shear viscosity $\eta$ has been calculated by using the Green-Kubo relation
at the cascade level. We have compared the numerical results for $\eta$
obtained from the Green-Kubo correlator with the analytical formula in both the
Relaxation Time Approximation (RTA) and the Chapman-Enskog approximation (CE).
From this comparison we show that in the range of temperature explored in a
Heavy Ion collision the RTA underestimates the viscosity by about a factor of
2, while a good agreement is found between the CE approximation and Gree-Kubo
relation already at first order of approximation. The agreement with the CE
approximation supplies an analytical formula that allows to develop kinetic
transport theory at fixed shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$.
We show some results for the build up of anisotropic flows $v_{2}$ in a
transport approach at fixed shear viscosity to entropy density ratio, $\eta/s$.
We study the impact of a T-dependent $\eta/s(T)$ on the generation of the
elliptic flows at both RHIC and LHC. We show that the transport approach
provides, in a unified way, a tool able to naturally describe the
$v_{2}(p_{T})$ in a wide range of $p_{T}$, including also the description of
the rise and fall and saturation of the $v_{2}(p_{T})$ observed at LHC.
Finally, we have studied the evolution of the quark-gluon composition employing
a Boltzmann-Vlasov transport approach that include: the mean fields dynamics,
associated to the quasi-particle model, and the elastic and inelastic
collisions for massive quarks and gluons. Following the chemical evolution from
an initial gluon dominated plasma we predict a quark dominance close to $T_{C}$

is performed to evaluate the adsorption, diffusion, and charge state of several
transition metal monomers on both stoichiometric and reduced rutile TiO2 (110)
surface. The role of oxygen vacancy (Ov) with its accompanying excess electrons
in influencing the activation of the monomers is examined. For pristine reduced
surface, our hybrid functional calculation shows that only a small portion
(around 5%) of the excess electrons occupy the topmost surface, which are
mainly delocalized at the second nearest and third nearest fivefold coordinated
Ti (Ti5c) atoms. The small amounts of excess electrons populating at the Ti5c
atoms can be transferred to strongly electronegative adsorbates like Au and Pt
thus enabling a moderate adsorption, whereas no stable adsorption at the Ti5c
site is found for other less electronegative TM adatoms(Ag, Cu, Fe, Co, Ni and
Pd) on the reduced surface and for all the adatoms on stoichiometric surface.
This finding clarify the origin of the experimental observation of the
adsorption of O2 and CO molecules at Ti5c sites in connection with charge
transfer. In addition, the spatial redistribution of the excess electrons at
Ti5c sites around the Ov upon the adsorption of the monomers is thoroughly
examined. Our finding of an accumulation of excess electrons at the Ti5c sites
around the monomers explains the critical role of the perimeter interface of
the deposited nanoparticles in promoting the adsorption and activation of
reactants observed in experiments.

HW Virginis was announced, based on systematic variations in the timing of
eclipses between the two stars. The planets invoked in that work were
significantly more massive than Jupiter, and moved on orbits that were mutually
crossing - an architecture which suggests that mutual encounters and strong
gravitational interactions are almost guaranteed. In this work, we perform a
highly detailed analysis of the proposed HW Vir planetary system. First, we
consider the dynamical stability of the system as proposed in the discovery
work. Through a mapping process involving 91,125 individual simulations, we
find that the system is so unstable that the planets proposed simply cannot
exist, due to mean lifetimes of less than a thousand years across the whole
parameter space. We then present a detailed re-analysis of the observational
data on HW Vir, deriving a new orbital solution that provides a very good fit
to the observational data. Our new analysis yields a system with planets more
widely spaced, and of lower mass, than that proposed in the discovery work, and
yields a significantly greater (and more realistic) estimate of the uncertainty
in the orbit of the outermost body. Despite this, a detailed dynamical analysis
of this new solution similarly reveals that it also requires the planets to
move on orbits that are simply not dynamically feasible. Our results imply that
some mechanism other than the influence of planetary companions must be the
principal cause of the observed eclipse timing variations for HW Vir. If the
sys- tem does host exoplanets, they must move on orbits differing greatly from
those previously proposed. Our results illustrate the critical importance of
performing dynamical analyses as a part of the discovery process for
multiple-planet exoplanetary systems.

performed on a randomly chosen realization together with the neighborhood to
estimate the objective function instead of using multiple simulations on
multiple realizations. This approach is combined with the stochastic optimizer
CMA-ES. The proposed approach is shown on the benchmark reservoir case PUNQ-S3
to be able to capture the geological uncertainty using a smaller number of

it is recursive, it is difficult to embed into a linear optimization problem.

high-contrast imaging. On this problem, dramatic improvements are translated to
an ability to solve problems with a much finer grid of discretized points. As

model was formulated as a linear programming problem and solved using widely

gone up by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the 55 years covered by the data. It
also correctly identifies the known phase of the solar cycle; i.e., the date of
the last solar minimum. It turns out that the maximum slope of the solar cycle
sinusoid in the regression model is about the same size as the slope produced
by the linear trend. The fact that the solar cycle was correctly extracted by
the model is a strong indicator that effects of this size, in particular the
slope of the linear trend, can be accurately determined from the 55 years of

detected by Fermi/LAT, a unique observation testifying to particle acceleration
in the system. The outburst can be considered a scaled-down supernova, with
short dynamical time scale, and thus can constitute a test case for theories of
the origin of galactic cosmic rays. We aim at determining the properties of the
accelerated particles and identifying the origin of the high-energy radiation.
We developed a model for diffusive shock acceleration and non-thermal emission
in V407 Cyg, complemented by an evaluation of the thermal emission from the
shocked plasma. We considered both leptonic and hadronic contributions to the
non-thermal processes, and investigated the effect of many binary and nova
parameters. The gamma-ray emission is mostly of leptonic origin and arises
predominantly from inverse-Compton scattering of the nova light. Upscattering
of the red giant photons is a minor contribution. Matching the light curve
requires gas accumulation in the vicinity of the white dwarf, as a consequence
of wind accretion, while the spectrum imposes particle scattering close to the
Bohm limit in the upstream equipartition magnetic field. The nova accelerated
protons (respectively electrons) with energies up to ~300GeV (respectively
~20GeV), for a total non-thermal energy 10^43 erg after two weeks, representing
~10% of the initial nova kinetic energy. The electron-to-proton ratio at
injection is 6%. The V407 Cyg eruption can be understood from the same
principles that are invoked for particle acceleration in supernova remnants,
although without the need for strong magnetic field amplification. The
population of novae in symbiotic systems is a negligible source of Galactic

However, the
proposed warping source -- non-axisymmetric radiation pressure -- does not
apply to white dwarfs. In this letter we report the first Smoothed Particle
Hydrodynamic simulations of accretion disks in SU UMa-type systems that
naturally tilt, warp, and simultaneously precess in the prograde and retrograde
directions using white dwarf V344 Lyrae in the Kepler field as our model. After
~79 days in V344 Lyrae, the disk angular momentum L_d becomes misaligned to the
orbital angular momentum L_o. As the gas stream remains normal to L_o,
hydrodynamics (e.g., the lift force) is a likely source to disk tilt. In
addition to tilt, the outer disk annuli cyclically change shape from circular
to highly eccentric due to tidal torques by the secondary star. The effect of
simultaneous prograde and retrograde precession is a warp of the colder, denser
midplane as seen along the disk rim. The simulated rate of apsidal advance to
nodal regression per orbit nearly matches the observed ratio in V344 Lyrae.

analysis of world data showed that the strength of the EMC effect is linearly
correlated with the relative amount of Two-Nucleon Short Range Correlated pairs

overlap, giving them large relative momentum and low center of mass momentum,
where high and low is relative to the Fermi momentum of the nucleus. The
observed correlation indicates that the EMC effect, like 2N-SRC pairs, is
related to high momentum nucleons in the nucleus. This paper reviews previous

analysis of high-resolution and high-S/N spectra, however, is strongly
restricted by the lack of reliable atomic data for highly ionized species from
intermediate-mass metals to trans-iron elements. Especially data for the latter
has only been sparsely calculated. Many of their lines are identified in
spectra of extremely hot, hydrogen-deficient post-AGB stars. A reliable
determination of their abundances establishes crucial constraints for AGB
nucleosynthesis simulations and, thus, for stellar evolutionary theory.
  In a previous analysis of the UV spectrum of RE 0503-289, spectral lines of
highly ionized Ga, Ge, As, Se, Kr, Mo, Sn, Te, I, and Xe were identified.
Individual abundance determinations are hampered by the lack of reliable
oscillator strengths. Most of these identified lines stem from Ge V. In
addition, we identified Ge VI lines for the first time. We calculated Ge V and
Ge VI oscillator strengths to consider their radiative and collisional
bound-bound transitions in detail in our non-LTE stellar-atmosphere models for
the analysis of the Ge IV - VI spectrum exhibited in high-resolution and

RE 0503-289 (Teff = 70 kK, log g = 7.5) at log Ge = -3.8 +/- 0.3 (mass
fraction, about 650 times solar).
  Reliable measurements and calculations of atomic data are a prerequisite for
stellar-atmosphere modeling. Our oscillator-strength calculations have allowed,
for the first time, Ge V and Ge VI lines to be successfully reproduced in a

instance bounds on the values of numerical program variables. More
specifically, we study the problem of performing static analysis by abstract
interpretation using template linear constraint domains. Such invariants can be
obtained by Kleene iterations that are, in order to guarantee termination,
accelerated by widening operators. In many cases, however, applying this form
of extrapolation leads to invariants that are weaker than the strongest
inductive invariant that can be expressed within the abstract domain in use.
Another well-known source of imprecision of traditional abstract interpretation
techniques stems from their use of join operators at merge nodes in the control
flow graph. The mentioned weaknesses may prevent these methods from proving
safety properties. The technique we develop in this article addresses both of
these issues: contrary to Kleene iterations accelerated by widening operators,
it is guaranteed to yield the strongest inductive invariant that can be
expressed within the template linear constraint domain in use. It also eschews
join operators by distinguishing all paths of loop-free code segments. Formally
speaking, our technique computes the least fixpoint within a given template
linear constraint domain of a transition relation that is succinctly expressed
as an existentially quantified linear real arithmetic formula. In contrast to
previously published techniques that rely on quantifier elimination, our
algorithm is proved to have optimal complexity: we prove that the decision
problem associated with our fixpoint problem is in the second level of the
polynomial-time hierarchy.

explosions that might result from the ignition of a detonation during the
violent merger of white dwarf (WD) binaries. Determining their brightness
distribution is critical for evaluating whether such an explosion model could
be responsible for a significant fraction of the observed population of SNe Ia.
We argue that the brightness of an explosion realized via the violent merger
model is determined by the mass of nickel 56 produced in the detonation of the
primary WD. We use a set of sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD detonation models to
derive a relationship between primary WD mass and expected peak bolometric
brightness. We use this relationship to convert the masses of merging primary
WDs from binary population models to a predicted distribution of explosion
brightness. We find a striking similarity between the shape of our theoretical
peak-magnitude distribution and that observed for SNe Ia: our model produces a
brightness distribution that roughly covers the range and matches the shape of
the one observed for SNe Ia. However, this agreement hinges on a particular
phase of mass accretion during binary evolution: the primary WD gains
~0.15-0.35 Msun from a slightly-evolved helium star companion. We also find
that with high probability, violent WD mergers involving the most massive
primaries (which should produce bright SNe) have delay times <500 Myr

are studied from the point of view of flux and stress theory of continuum

over the unit sphere, it is shown that Lambert's rule follows from a balance
law for the transfer of radiative power in each direction $\norb$ of the

assumption that the corresponding flux vector field $\radvec_{\norb}$ be

construct a histogram approximation to the function using a partition of the

consider two adaptations; the first is to subtract the histogram approximation,

integrate the difference using Monte Carlo; the second is to modify the bin

trigger for rebinning, which we claim is more stable than the \chi-squared test
that is commonly used for this purpose. We provide a program that we have used

ways in which the results of any such Monte Carlo integration program can be

of transparent materials whose complex surfaces present a real challenge for

transparent object is reconstructed by measuring light deflection under
multiple orientations. We show that this imaging modality can be made
""compressive"", i.e., a correct RIM reconstruction is achievable with far less
observations than required by traditional Filtered Back Projection (FBP)
methods. Assuming a cartoon-shape RIM model, this reconstruction is driven by
minimizing the map Total-Variation under a fidelity constraint with the
available observations. Moreover, two other realistic assumptions are added to
improve the stability of our approach: the map positivity and a frontier
condition. Numerically, our method relies on an accurate ODT sensing model and
on a primal-dual minimization scheme, including easily the sensing operator and
the proposed RIM constraints. We conclude this paper by demonstrating the power
of our method on synthetic and experimental data under various compressive
scenarios. In particular, the compressiveness of the stabilized ODT problem is
demonstrated by observing a typical gain of 20 dB compared to FBP at only 5% of
360 incident light angles for moderately noisy sensing.

fast enough, support stable bright solitons, without the use of any linear
potential. Our objective is to test the genericity of this mechanism for other
nonlinearities, by applying it to one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) quintic
SDF media. The models may be implemented in optics (in particular, in colloidal
suspensions of nanoparticles), and the 1D model may be applied to the
description of the Tonks-Girardeau gas of ultracold bosons. In 1D, the
nonlinearity-modulation function is taken as $% g_{0}+\sinh ^{2}(\beta x) $.
This model admits a subfamily of exact solutions for fundamental solitons.
Generic \ soliton solutions are constructed in a numerical form, and also by
means of the Thomas-Fermi and variational approximations (TFA and VA). In
particular, a new ansatz for the VA is proposed, in the form of ""raised
$\mathrm{sech}$"", which provides for an essentially better accuracy than the
usual Gaussian ansatz. The stability of all the fundamental (nodeless) 1D
solitons is established through the computation of the corresponding
eigenvalues for small perturbations, and also verified by direct simulations.
Higher-order 1D solitons with two nodes have a limited stability region, all
the modes with more than two nodes being unstable. It is concluded that the
recently proposed ""anti-VK"" stability criterion for fundamental bright solitons
in systems with SDF nonlinearities holds here too. Particular exact solutions
for 2D solitons are produced as well.

energy injected through driving shows a strong energy transfer to perpendicular

in wavenumber space. The generation of higher harmonics along the parallel

spatial structure in regression models, there is little precedent for
incorporating spatial dependence in covariate inclusion probabilities for
regionally varying regression models. The lone existing approach is limited by
difficult computation and the requirement that the spatial dependence be
represented on a lattice, making this method inappropriate for areal models
with irregular structures that often arise in ecology, epidemiology, and the
social sciences. Here we present a novel method for spatial variable selection
in areal generalized linear models that can accommodate arbitrary spatial
structures and works with a broad subset of GLM likelihoods. The method uses a
latent probit model with a spatial dependence structure where the binary
response is taken as a covariate inclusion indicator for area-specific GLMs.
The covariate inclusion indicators arise via thresholding of latent standard
normals on which we place a conditionally autoregressive prior. We propose an
efficient MCMC algorithm for computation that is entirely conjugate in any
model with a conditionally Gaussian representation of the likelihood, thereby
encompassing logistic, probit, multinomial probit and logit, Gaussian, and
negative binomial regressions through the use of existing data augmentation
methods. We demonstrate superior parameter recovery and prediction in
simulation studies as well as in applications to geographic voting patterns and
population estimation. Though the method is very broadly applicable, we note in
particular that prior to this work, spatial population
estimation/capture-recapture models allowing for varying list dependence

determine the far-infrared (FIR) properties of 50 Broad Absorption Line Quasars
(BAL QSOs). Our sample contains 49 high-ionization BAL QSOs (HiBALs) and 1
low-ionization BAL QSO (LoBAL) which are compared against a sample of 329
non-BAL QSOs. These samples are matched over the redshift range 1.5 \leq z <
2.3 and in absolute i-band magnitude over the range -28 \leq M_{i} \leq -24. Of
these, 3 BAL QSOs (HiBALs) and 27 non-BAL QSOs are detected at the > 5 sigma
level. We calculate star-formation rates (SFR) for our individually detected
HiBAL QSOs and the non-detected LoBAL QSO as well as average SFRs for the BAL
and non-BAL QSO samples based on stacking the Herschel data. We find no
difference between the HiBAL and non-BAL QSO samples in the FIR, even when
separated based on differing BAL QSO classifications. Using Mrk 231 as a
template, the weighted mean SFR is estimated to be \approx240\pm21 M_{\odot}
yr^{-1} for the full sample, although this figure should be treated as an upper
limit if AGN-heated dust makes a contribution to the FIR emission. Despite
tentative claims in the literature, we do not find a dependence of {\sc C\,iv}
equivalent width on FIR emission, suggesting that the strength of any outflow
in these objects is not linked to their FIR output. These results strongly
suggest that BAL QSOs (more specifically HiBALs) can be accommodated within a
simple AGN unified scheme in which our line-of-sight to the nucleus intersects
outflowing material. Models in which HiBALs are caught towards the end of a
period of enhanced spheroid and black-hole growth, during which a wind
terminates the star-formation activity, are not supported by the observed FIR
properties.

two. In this paper, having reduced the conjecture to the case of dimension
three, if the ring is regular and local of dimension three, we explicitly
describe a family of prime ideals of height two minimally generated by three
elements. Weakening the hypothesis of regularity, we find that, to achieve the

of the residue field and the multiplicity of the ring being at most three. In
the second part of the paper we turn our attention to the category of standard
graded algebras. A geometrical approach via a double use of a Bertini Theorem,
together with a result of A. Simis, B. Ulrich and W.V. Vasconcelos, allows us
to obtain a definitive answer in this setting. Finally, by adapting work of M.
Miller on prime Bourbaki ideals in local rings, we detail some more technical
results concerning the existence in standard graded algebras of homogeneous
prime ideals with an ""excessive"" number of generators.

the same static universality class as the 3D Ising model and the liquid-gas
phase transition. The properties of the equation of state, the transport
coefficients, and especially the location of the critical point are under
intense theoretical investigation. Some experiments are underway, and many more
are planned, at high energy heavy ion accelerators. Purpose: Develop a model of
the thermal conductivity, which diverges at the critical point, and use it to
study the impact of hydrodynamic fluctuations on observables in high energy
heavy ion collisions. Methods: We apply mode coupling theory, together with a
previously developed model of the free energy that incorporates the critical
exponents and amplitudes, to construct a model of the thermal conductivity in
the vicinity of the critical point. The effect of the thermal conductivity on
correlation functions in heavy ion collisions is studied in a boost invariant
hydrodynamic model via fluctuations, or noise. Results: We find that the closer
a thermodynamic trajectory comes to the critical point the greater is the
magnitude of the fluctuations in thermodynamic variables and in the 2-particle
correlation functions in momentum space. Conclusions: It may be possible to
discern the existence of a critical point, its location, and thermodynamic and
transport properties near to it in heavy ion collisions using the methods
developed here.

throughput in dense multichannel multi-radio (MC-MR) wireless networks.
Specifically, we consider an MC-MR network where all nodes are within the
transmission range of each other. This situation is encountered in many
real-life settings such as students in a lecture hall, delegates attending a
conference, or soldiers in a battlefield. In this scenario, we show that
intelligent assignment of the available channels results in a significantly
higher per node throughput. We first propose a class of channel assignment
algorithms, parameterized by T (the number of transceivers per node), that can
achieve $\Theta(1/N^{1/T})$ per node throughput using $\Theta(TN^{1-1/T})$
channels. In view of practical constraints on $T$, we then propose another
algorithm that can achieve $\Theta(1/(\log_2 N)^2)$ per node throughput using
only two transceivers per node. Finally, we identify a fundamental relationship
between the achievable per node throughput, the total number of channels used,
and the network size under any strategy. Using analysis and simulations, we
show that our algorithms achieve close to optimal performance at different
operating points on this curve. Our work has several interesting implications
on the optimal network design for dense MC-MR wireless networks.

physics will dominate the photoresponse. Here we investigate photocurrent in a
vanadium dioxide, an exemplary strongly correlated material known for its
dramatic metal-insulator transition (MIT) at Tc = 68 C which could be useful
for optoelectronic detection and switching up to ultraviolet wavelengths. Using
scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) on individual suspended VO2 nanobeams
we observe photoresponse peaked at the metal-insulator boundary but extended
throughout both insulating and metallic phases. We determine that the response
is photo-thermal, implying efficient carrier relaxation to a local equilibrium
in a manner consistent with strong correlations. Temperature dependent
measurements reveal subtle phase changes within the insulating state. We
further demonstrate switching of the photocurrent by optical control of the
metal-insulator boundary arrangement. Our work shows the value of SPCM applied
to nanoscale crystals for investigating strongly correlated materials, and the
results are relevant for designing and controlling optoelectronic devices
employing such materials.

planetary systems. An efficient way to identify these systems is through their
infrared excess. Most studies so far concentrated on early-type or solar-type
stars, but less effort has gone into investigating M dwarfs.
  We characterize the mid-infrared photometric behavior of M dwarfs and search
for infrared excess in nearby M dwarfs taken from the volume-limited RECONS
sample using data from the WISE satellite and the 2MASS catalog. Our sample
consists of 85 sources encompassing 103 M dwarfs. We derive empirical infrared
colors from these data and discuss their errors. Based on this, we check the
stars for infrared excess and discuss the minimum excess we would be able to
detect.
  Other than the M8.5 dwarf SCR 1845-6357 A, where the excess is produced by a
known T6 companion, we detect no excesses in any of our sample stars. The
limits we derive for the 22um excess are slightly higher than the usual
detection limit of 10-15% for Spitzer studies, but including the [12]-[22]
color in our analysis allows us to derive tight constraints on the fractional
dust luminosity L_dust/L_star. We show that this result is consistent with M
dwarf excesses in the mid-inrared being as frequent as excesses around
earlier-type stars. The low detection rate could be an age effect. We also
present a tentative excess detection at 22um around the known cold debris disk
M dwarf AU Mic, which is not part of our statistical sample.
  There is still no clear detection of a mid-infrared excess around any old
(>30 Myr) main-sequence M dwarf. It is unclear whether this is due to a
different dust evolution around M dwarfs or whether this is an age effect
combined with the diffculties involved in searching M dwarfs for infrared
excesses. A significantly larger sample of well-studied M dwarfs is required to
solve this question.
