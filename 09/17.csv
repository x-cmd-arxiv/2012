interstellar extinction which was derived from the optical Sloan Digital Sky

particles that collide elastically with the billiard boundary and with each
other. Such a two-particle circular billiard provides a clean example of an
""intermittent"" system. This billiard system behaves chaotically, but the time
scale on which chaos manifests can become arbitrarily long as the sizes of the
confined particles become smaller. The finite-time dynamics of this system
depends on the relative frequencies of (chaotic) particle-particle collisions
versus (integrable) particle-boundary collisions, and investigating these
dynamics is computationally intensive because of the long time scales involved.
To help improve understanding of such two-particle dynamics, we compare the
results of diagnostics used to measure chaotic dynamics for a two-particle
circular billiard with those computed for two types of one-particle circular
billiards in which a confined particle undergoes random perturbations.
Importantly, such one-particle approximations are much less computationally
demanding than the original two-particle system, and we expect them to yield
reasonable estimates of the extent of chaotic behavior in the two-particle
system when the sizes of confined particles are small. Our computations of
recurrence-rate coefficients, finite-time Lyapunov exponents, and
autocorrelation coefficients support this hypothesis and suggest that studying
randomly perturbed one-particle billiards has the potential to yield insights
into the aggregate properties of two-particle billiards, which are difficult to
investigate directly without enormous computation times (especially when the
sizes of the confined particles are small).

radio-frequency (RF) signals. Building on classic cognitive radio networks, we
propose a novel method for network coexisting where mobiles from a secondary
network, called secondary transmitters (STs), either harvest energy from
transmissions by nearby transmitters from a primary network, called primary
transmitters (PTs), or transmit information if PTs are sufficiently far away;
STs store harvested energy in rechargeable batteries with finite capacity and
use all available energy for subsequent transmission when batteries are fully
charged. In this model, each PT is centered at a guard zone and a harvesting
zone that are disks with given radiuses; a ST harvests energy if it lies in
some harvesting zone, transmits fixed-power signals if it is outside all guard
zones or else idles. Based on this model, the spatial throughput of the
secondary network is maximized using a stochastic-geometry model where PTs and
STs are modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson point processes (HPPPs),
under the outage constraints for coexisting networks and obtained in a simple
closed-form. It is observed from the result that the maximum secondary
throughput decreases linearly with the growing PT density, and the optimal ST
density is inversely proportional to the derived transmission probability for
STs.

method with an efficient strategy for finding the list of cell-cell
interactions by a dual tree traversal. A task-based threading model is used to
maximize thread-level parallelism and intra-node load-balancing. In order to
extract the full potential of the SIMD units on the latest CPUs, the inner

to use. Sometimes they are even used for business-critical applications. It is
however difficult for spreadsheet users to correctly assess the quality of
spreadsheets, especially with respect to their understandability.
Understandability of spreadsheets is important, since spreadsheets often have a
long lifespan, during which they are used by several users.
  In this paper, we establish a set of spreadsheet understandability metrics.
We start by studying related work and interviewing 40 spreadsheet professionals
to obtain a set of characteristics that might contribute to understandability
problems in spreadsheets. Based on those characteristics we subsequently
determine a number of understandability metrics. To evaluate the usefulness of
our metrics, we conducted a series of experiments in which professional
spreadsheet users performed a number of small maintenance tasks on a set of
spreadsheets from the EUSES spreadsheet corpus. We subsequently calculate the
correlation between the metrics and the performance of subjects on these tasks.
  The results clearly indicate that the number of ranges, the nesting depth and
the presence of conditional operations in formulas significantly increase the
difficulty of understanding a spreadsheet.

around the NGC 3166/9 group core, which we mosaic at higher resolution using
six GMRT pointings spanning ~1 square degree. A thorough search of the GMRT

3x10^8 M_sol and total dynamical masses up to 1.4x10^9 M_sol. A comparison of
the HI fluxes measured from the GMRT data to those measured in the ALFALFA data
suggests that a significant fraction (~60%) of the HI is smoothly distributed
on scales greater than an arcminute (~7 kpc at the NGC 3166/9 distance). We
compute stellar masses and star formation rates for the eight low-mass GMRT
detections, using ancillary SDSS and GALEX data, and use these values to
constrain their origin. Most of the detections are likely to be either
pre-existing dwarf irregular galaxies or short-lived, tidally formed knots;
however, one candidate, AGC 208457, is clearly associated with a tidal tail
extending below NGC 3166, exhibits a dynamical to gas mass ratio close to unity

properties of optically thick spectral lines in epochs following the

optical spectra of supernovae assume that forbidden-line emission comprises
most if not all spectral features. However, evidence exists which suggests that
some spectra exhibit line profiles formed via optically thick
resonance-scattering even months or years after the supernova explosion. To
explore this possibility we present a geometrical approach to supernova
spectrum formation based on the ""Elementary Supernova"" model, wherein we
investigate the characteristics of resonance-scattering in optically thick
lines while replacing the photosphere with a transparent central core emitting
non-blackbody continuum radiation, akin to the optical continuum provided by
decaying 56Co formed during the explosion. We develop the mathematical
framework necessary for solving the radiative transfer equation under these
conditions, and calculate spectra for both isolated and blended lines. Our
comparisons with analogous results from the Elementary Supernova code SYNOW
reveal several marked differences in line formation. Most notably, resonance
lines in these conditions form P Cygni-like profiles, but the emission peaks
and absorption troughs shift redward and blueward, respectively, from the
line's rest wavelength by a significant amount, despite the spherically
symmetric distribution of the line optical depth in the ejecta. These
properties and others that we find in this work could lead to misidentification
of lines or misattribution of properties of line-forming material at
post-photospheric times in supernova optical spectra.

(2012), which consists in determining the best Christofides $\{s,t\}$-tour out
of those constructed from a family $\Fscr_{>0}$ of trees having a convex
combination dominated by an optimal solution $x^*$ of the fractional
relaxation. They give the approximation guarantee $\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{2}$ for
such an $\{s,t\}$-tour, which is the first improvement after the 5/3 guarantee
of Hoogeveen's Christofides type algorithm (1991). Cheriyan, Friggstad and Gao
(2012) extended this result to a 13/8-approximation of shortest connected

  The ratio 8/5 is proved by simplifying and improving the approach of An,
Kleinberg and Shmoys that consists in completing $x^*/2$ in order to dominate
the cost of ""parity correction"" for spanning trees. We partition the edge-set
of each spanning tree in $\Fscr_{>0}$ into an $\{s,t\}$-path (or more
generally, into a $T$-join) and its complement, which induces a decomposition
of $x^*$. This decomposition can be refined and then efficiently used to
complete $x^*/2$ without using linear programming or particular properties of
$T$, but by adding to each cut deficient for $x^*/2$ an individually tailored
explicitly given vector, inherent in $x^*$.
  A simple example shows that the Best of Many Christofides algorithm may not
find a shorter $\{s,t\}$-tour than 3/2 times the incidentally common optima of
the problem and of its fractional relaxation.

propagating disturbances in intensity and Doppler velocity with a projected
propagation speed of about $60\pm 4.8$ km s$^{-1}$ and a periodicity of
$\approx$14.5 min. To our knowledge, this is the first simultaneous detection
of propagating disturbances in intensity as well as in Doppler velocity in a
coronal hole. During the propagation, an intensity enhancement is associated
with a blue-shifted Doppler velocity. These disturbances are clearly seen in
intensity also at higher latitudes (i.e. closer to the limb), while
disturbances in Doppler velocity becomes faint there. The spectral line
profiles averaged along the propagating ridges are found to be symmetric, to be
well fitted by a single Gaussian, and have no noticeable red-blue asymmetry.
Based on our analysis, we interpret these disturbances in terms of propagating
slow magneto-acoustic waves.

accelerations of the six well-fitted galaxies have the same magnitude, with an

fact, we then carry out a one-parameter ($\Upsilon_*$) fit to the six galaxies,

2.38, with a spectral resolution three times better than previous published
work. As with previous observations, the blob has a chaotic velocity structure,
much of which breaks up into multiple components. Our spectroscopy shows,
however, that some of these multiple components are extremely narrow: they have
velocity widths of less than 100 km/s.
  Combining these new data with previous observations, we argue that this
Lyman-alpha blob resides in a dark-matter halo of around 10^13 solar masses. At
the centre of this halo are two compact red massive galaxies. They are
surrounded by hot gas, probably a super-wind from merger-induced nuclear
starbursts. This hot gas has shut down star formation in the non-nuclear region
of these galaxies, leading to their red-and-dead colours.
  A filament or lump of infalling cold gas is colliding with the hot gas phase
and being shocked to high temperatures, while still around 30kpc from the red
galaxies. The shock region is self-absorbed in Lyman-alpha but produces C IV
emission.
  Further out still, the cold gas in a number of sub-halos is being lit up,
most likely by a combination of tidally triggered star formation, bow-shocks as
they plough through the hot halo medium, resonant scattering of Lyman-alpha
from the filament collision, and tidal stripping of gas which enhances the
Lyman-alpha escape fraction. The observed Lyman-alpha emission from the Blob is
dominated by the sum of the emission from these sub-halos.
  On statistical grounds, we argue that Lyman-alpha blobs are not greatly
elongated in shape, and that most are not powered by ionisation or scattering
from a central active galactic nucleus or starburst.

write a general ""master formula"" that allows us to determine the parameters of

and $\lambda$ ('t Hooft constant) limit by integrating out the infinite towers
of vector and axial-vector mesons other than the lowest $\rho$ and $\omega$

Skyrmion as the solitonic description of baryons are \textit{independent} of
the HLS parameter $a$. Therefore the only parameters of the model are the pion
decay constant and the vector meson mass. Once determined in the meson sector,
we have a totally parameter-free theory that allows us to study unequivocally
the role of light vector mesons in the Skyrmion structure. We find, as
suggested by Sutcliffe, that inclusion of the $\rho$ meson reduces the soliton
mass, which makes the Skyrmion come closer to the
Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) soliton, but the role of the $\omega$
meson is found to increase the soliton mass. In a stark contrast, the
$\Delta$-$N$ mass difference, which is determined by the moment of inertia in
adiabatic collective quantization of the Skyrmion, is increased by the $\rho$
vector meson, while it is reduced by the inclusion of the $\omega$ meson. All
these observations show the importance of the $\omega$ meson in the properties

fields of scientific enquiry, including our understanding of the scale of the
solar system, the details of the Earth's motion through space, and the
comprehension and acceptance of Newtonianism. They also proved crucial to the
practical task of maritime navigation. Over the past 400 years, during which
positional accuracy has improved roughly logarithmically with time, the
distances to the nearest stars were triangulated, making use of the extended
measurement baseline given by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This led to
quantifying the extravagantly vast scale of the Universe, to a determination of
the physical properties of stars, and to the resulting characterisation of the
structure, dynamics and origin of our Galaxy. After a period in the middle

approach is a semi-classical type, where the spacetime geometry of black holes
is considered to be classical but the fields moving in the background are
quantum in nature. Some notable facets of this thesis are the following. We
start by looking into the issue of generalized Smarr mass formula for arbitrary
dimensional black holes in Einstein-Maxwell gravity. We derive this formula for
these black holes and also demonstrate that such a formula can be expressed in
the form of a dimension independent identity $K_{\chi^{\mu}}=2ST$ (where the
l.h.s is the Komar conserved charge corresponding to the null Killing vector
$\chi^{\mu}$ and in the r.h.s $S, T$ are the semi-classical entropy and
temperature of a black hole) defined at the black hole event horizon. We
highlight the role of exact differentials in computations involving black hole
thermodynamics. Some results like the first law of black hole thermodynamics
and semi-classical entropy are obtained without using the laws of black hole
mechanics as usually done. The blackbody (Hawking) radiation spectrum for
higher dimensional black holes is computed by using a density matrix technique
of tunneling mechanism by considering both event and cosmological horizons. We
also provide the modifications to the semi-classical Hawking temperature and
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy due to various effects. These modifications are
mainly found due to higher order (in $\hbar$) effects to the WKB ansatz used
for the quantum tunneling formalism and non-commutative gravity inspired
effects. Finally, in we discuss phase transition phenomena in black holes. We
formulate a new methodology based on Clausius-Clapeyron and Ehrenfest's
equations to exhibit and classify phase transitions in black holes in analogy
to what is done in standard thermodynamics.

of motion for the shell, we obtain stationary solutions of charged regular
black holes and examine stability of the solutions. Stationary solutions are
found in limited ranges of 0.87L < m < 1.99L, and they are stable against small
radial displacement of the shell with fixed values of m, M, and Q if M>0, where
L is the de Sitter horizon radius, m the black hole mass, M the proper mass of

of a radio-loud/radio-quiet double AGN system, comprising a weak line radio
galaxy (WLRG) separated by 25 kpc (in projection) from a Seyfert 1 nucleus at
the same redshift. Our deep Gemini optical images show a highly disturbed
morphology, with a warped dust lane crossing through the halo and nuclear
regions of the radio galaxy host, tidal tails, and a bridge connecting the
radio galaxy to the Seyfert 1 nucleus. Spectral synthesis modelling of our
Gemini optical spectrum of the radio galaxy shows evidence for a reddened young
stellar population of age <100 Myr. Further evidence for recent star formation
activity in this source is provided by the detection of strong PAH features in
mid-IR Spitzer/IRS spectra. Together, these observations support a model in
which both AGN have been triggered simultaneously in a major galaxy merger.
However, despite the presence of a powerful FRII radio source, and the
apparently plentiful supply of fuel provided by the merger, the nucleus of the
radio galaxy shows only weak, low ionization emission line activity. We
speculate that the fuel supply to nuclear regions of the radio galaxy has
recently switched off (within the last ~10^6 yr), but the information about the
resulting decrease in nuclear AGN activity has yet to reach the extended lobes
and hotspots of the FRII radio source. Based on this scenario, we estimate that
powerful, intermediate redshift FRII radio sources have lifetimes of t\sim
5x10^6 yr. Overall, our observations emphasise that the fuelling of AGN
activity in major galaxy mergers is likely to be highly intermittent.

silicon nanowires (NWs) versus their diameter. We first address the simulation
of the optical absorption based on two different theoretical methods : the
first one, based on the Green function formalism, is useful to calculate the
scattering and absorption properties of a single or a finite set of NWs. The
second one, based on the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) method is
well-adapted to deal with a periodic set of NWs. In both cases, an increase of
the onset energy for the absorption is found with increasing diameter. Such
effect is experimentally illustrated, when photoconductivity measurements are
performed on single tapered Si nanowires connected between a set of several
electrodes. An increase of the nanowire diameter reveals a spectral shift of
the photocurrent intensity peak towards lower photon energies, that allows to
tune the absorption onset from the ultraviolet radiations to the visible light
spectrum.

stellar objects (MYSOs) present numerous challenges for observation and study.
In this work, we present spatially-resolved observations of one MYSO, AFGL
4176, together with survey and literature data, ranging from interferometric
observations with VLTI/MIDI in the mid-infrared, to single-dish Herschel
measurements in the far-infrared, and sub-millimeter data from APEX. We
consider this spatially-resolved, multi-wavelength data set in terms of both
radiative transfer and geometric models. We find that the observations are well
described by one-dimensional models overall, but there are also substantial
deviations from spherical symmetry at scales of tens to hundreds of
astronomical units, which are revealed by the mid-infrared interferometric
measurements. We use a multiple-component, geometric modeling approach to
explain the mid-infrared emission on scales of tens to hundreds of astronomical
units, and find the MIDI measurements are well described by a model consisting
of a one-dimensional Gaussian halo and an inclined (\theta=60 deg)
circumstellar disk extending out to several hundred astronomical units along a
position angle of 160 deg. Finally, we compare our results both with previous
models of this source, and with those of other MYSOs, and discuss the present
situation with mid-infrared interferometric observations of massive stars.

structure that is attributed to either the removal of degeneracy or the
activation of Raman modes due to disorder. A strong impurity band located at

decades, has been derived analytically in the zero- and double-quantum spaces.
The initial polarization in the double-quantum space is a constant of motion
under strong pulse condition ($|\omega_{1I}+\omega_{1S}|\gg |d(t)|$), while the
Hamiltonian in the zero-quantum space reduces to $d(t)\sigma_{z}^{\Delta}$
under the Hartmann-Hahn match condition ($\omega_{1I}=\omega_{1S}$). The time
dependent Hamilontian ($d(t)\sigma_{z}^{\Delta}$) in the zero-quantum space can
be expressed by average Hamiltonians. Since$[d(t')\sigma_{z}^{\Delta},
d(t"")\sigma_{z}^{\Delta}]=0$, only zero order average Hamiltonian needs to be
calculated, leading to an analytical solution of CP dynamics.

monad; this is subject only to the existence of certain limits. We clarify the
sense in which codensity monads act as substitutes for monads induced by
adjunctions. We also expand on an undeservedly ignored theorem of Kennison and
Gildenhuys: that the codensity monad of the inclusion of (finite sets) into
(sets) is the ultrafilter monad. This result is analogous to the correspondence
between measures and integrals. So, for example, we can speak of integration
against an ultrafilter. Using this language, we show that the codensity monad
of the inclusion of (finite-dimensional vector spaces) into (vector spaces) is
double dualization. From this it follows that compact Hausdorff spaces have a
linear analogue: linearly compact vector spaces. Finally, we show that
ultraproducts are categorically inevitable: the codensity monad of the
inclusion of (finite families of sets) into (families of sets) is the
ultraproduct monad.

little inter-annual correlation. Though the mean sea ice area has decreased
steadily in the period of satellite observations, a dramatic transition in the
dynamics was initiated with the record low September ice area in 2007. The
change is much more pronounced in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle than in
the annual mean ice area. The shape of the seasonal cycle is surprisingly
constant for the whole observational record despite the general decline. A
simple explanation, independent of the increased greenhouse warming, for the
shape of the seasonal cycle is offered. Thus the dramatic climate change in
arctic ice area is seen in the amplitude of the cycle and to a lesser extend
the annual mean and the summer ice extend. The reason why the climate change is
most pronounced in the amplitude is related to the rapid reduction in perennial
ice and thus a thinning of the ice. The analysis shows that a tipping point for
the arctic ice area was crossed in 2007.

the emission of particles on the brane exhibits a strong angular variation with
respect to the rotation axis of the black hole. It has been suggested that this
angular variation is the observable that could disentangle the dependence of
the radiation spectra on the number of extra dimensions and angular momentum of
the black hole. Working in the low-energy regime, we have employed analytical
formulae for the greybody factors, angular eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of
fermions and gauge bosons, and studied the characteristics of the corresponding
angular profiles of emission spectra in terms of only a few dominant partial
modes. We have confirmed that, in the low-energy channel, the emitted gauge
bosons become aligned to the rotation axis of the produced black hole while
fermions form an angle with the rotation axis whose exact value depends on the
angular-momentum of the black hole. In the case of scalar fields, we
demonstrated the existence of a ""spherically-symmetric zone"" that is followed
by the concentration of the emission on the equatorial plane, again in total
agreement with the exact numerical results.

and antimatter, perhaps comparable to the measured asymmetric mixture of
baryons and antibaryons. During the early stages of the Universe, the dark
matter particles are produced in a process similar to baryogenesis, and dark
matter freeze-out depends on the dark matter asymmetry and the annihilation
cross section (s-wave and p-wave annihilation channels). In these
\eta-parametrised asymmetric dark matter models (\eta-ADM), the dark matter
particles have an annihilation cross section close to the weak interaction
cross section, and a value of \eta-dark matter asymmetry close to the baryon
asymmetry \eta_B. Furthermore, we assume that dark matter scattering of
baryons, namely, the spin-independent scattering cross section, is of the same
order as the range of values suggested by several theoretical particle physics
models used to explain the current unexplained events reported in the
DAMA/LIBRA, CoGeNT and CRESST experiments. Here, we constrain \eta-ADM models
by investigating the impact of such a type of dark matter on the evolution of
the Sun, namely, the flux of solar neutrinos and helioseismology. We find that
dark matter particles with a mass smaller than 15 GeV, a spin-independent
scattering cross section on baryons of the order of a picobarn, and an
\eta-dark matter asymmetry with a value in the interval 10^{-12}-10^{-10},
would induce a change in solar neutrino fluxes in disagreement with current
neutrino flux measurements. A natural consequence of this model is suppressed
annihilation, thereby reducing the tension between indirect and direct dark
matter detection experiments, but the model also allows a greatly enhanced
annihilation cross section. All the cosmological \eta-asymmetric dark matter
scenarios that we discuss are in agreement with the current WMAP measured
values.

the initial conditions for life and clues as to the history and formation of
the Solar System. We follow the pioneering work of Bond et al. (2010) and
combine circumstellar disk models, chemical equilibrium calculations and
dynamical simulations of planet formation to study the bulk composition of
rocky planets. We use condensation sequence calculations to estimate the
initial abundance of solids in the circumstellar disk with properties
determined from time dependent theoretical models. We combine this with
dynamical simulations of planetesimal growth that trace the solids during the
planet formation process. We calculate the elemental abundances in the
resulting planets and explore how these vary with the choice of disk model and
the initial conditions within the Solar Nebula.
  Although certain characteristics of the terrestrial planets in the Solar
System could be reproduced, none of our models could reproduce the abundance
properties of all the planets. We found that the choice of the initial
planetesimal disk mass and of the disk model has a significant effect on
composition gradients. Disk models that give higher pressure and temperature
result in larger variations in the bulk chemical compositions of the resulting
planets due to inhomogeneities in the element abundance profiles and due to the
different source regions of the planets in the dynamical simulations. We
observed a trend that massive planets and planets with relatively small
semi-major axes are more sensitive to these variations than smaller planets at
larger radial distance. Only these large variations in the simulated chemical
abundances can potentially explain the diverse bulk composition of the Solar
System planets, whereas Mercury's bulk composition can not be reproduced in our
approach.

within the constraints imposed by LHC data, we analyze the charge asymmetry,
p_T spectrum & invariant mass in t\bar t production data at LHC. The

We also explore the contribution of this model to single top quark production
mediated by charged & neutral color-octet vector bosons. FV couplings
introduced then induce same-sign top-pair production process which is analyzed
for both hadron colliders. We have incorporated effect of finite decay width of
color octets on these processes. We find that it is possible to explain the
observed afbt anomaly in color-octet vector model without transgressing
production cross sections of all these processes both through FC and FV
couplings at Tevatron. We predict best point sets in model parameter space for
specific choices of color-octet masses corresponding to chi^2_min evaluated
using mttb and dyy spectrum of afbt from observed data set at Tevatron (8.7

couplings in comparison to top-pair production. We provide 95% exclusion
contours on the plane of FV chiral couplings from recent data at Tevatron, CMS

relaxation allows us to reduce the multi-flow problem into a family of
single-flow problems, for which we can analyze both theoretically and
numerically the existence of optimal control policies of special structure. In
particular, we show that for a variety of parameters, TCP flows can be
optimally controlled in routers by so-called index policies, but not always by
threshold policies. We have also implemented index policies in Network
Simulator-3 and tested in a simple topology their applicability in real
networks. The simulation results show that the index policy covers a big range

TCP models, across users with different round-trip-time and minimum buffer

and reduce the volume of the stored data. ALICE applies a multi-level hardware
trigger scheme where fast detectors are used to feed a three-level (L0, L1, and
L2) deep chain. The High-Level Trigger (HLT) is a fourth filtering stage
sitting logically between the L2 trigger and the data acquisition event
building. The EMCal detector comprises a large area electromagnetic calorimeter
that extends the momentum measurement of photons and neutral mesons up to
$p_T=250$ GeV/c, which improves the ALICE capability to perform jet
reconstruction with measurement of the neutral energy component of jets. An
online reconstruction and trigger chain has been developed within the HLT
framework to sharpen the EMCal hardware triggers, by combining the central
barrel tracking information with the shower reconstruction (clusters) in the
calorimeter. In the present report the status and the functionality of the
software components developed for the EMCal HLT online reconstruction and
trigger chain will be discussed, as well as preliminary results from their
commissioning performed during the 2011 LHC running period.

the graviton contributions to the beta functions by imposing the cutoffs on the

germanium (HPGe) detector placed at different scattering angles. The excellent
energy resolution of the HPGe detector allows the selection of events with
Compton electrons of known energy in the LXe detector. We find that the
scintillation yield initially increases as the electron energy decreases from
120 keV to about 60keV but then decreases by about 30% from 60keV to 2keV. The
measured scintillation yield was also measured with conversion electrons from
the 32.1 keV and 9.4 keV transitions of the 83mKr isomer, used as an internal
calibration source. We find that the scintillation yield of the 32.1 keV
transition is compatible with that obtained from the Compton coincidence
measurement. On the other hand, the yield for the 9.4keV transition is much
higher than that measured for a Compton electron of the same energy. We
interpret the enhancement in the scintillation yield as due to the enhanced
recombination rate in the presence of Xe ions left from the 32.1 keV

fraction, defined as Mgas/(Mgas+Mstar), and the star formation efficiency (SFE)
defined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass
(LFIR/M(H2), i.e. a measure for the inverse of the gas depletion time. The
sources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with LFIR
greater than 10^12 Lo and experiencing starbursts. When we adopt a standard
ULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor, their molecular gas depletion time is less
than 100 Myr. Our full survey has now filled the gap of CO observations in the
0.2<z<1 range covering almost half of cosmic history. The detection rate in the
0.6 < z < 1 interval is 38% (15 galaxies out of 39), compared to 60% for the
0.2<z<0.6 interval. The average CO luminosity is L'CO = 1.8 10^10 K km/s pc^2,
corresponding to an average H2 mass of 1.45 10^10 Mo. From observation of 7
galaxies in both CO(2-1) and CO(4-3), a high gas excitation has been derived;
together with the dust mass estimation, this supports the choice of our low
ULIRG conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2, for our sample sources.
We find that both the gas fraction and the SFE significantly increase with

An unbiased and reliable exact diagonalization (ED) approach for ground state
properties as well as the finite temperature Lanczos method (FTLM) for specific
heat and the uniform susceptibility are employed for small tiles on the square
lattice. They lead to two major results: Firstly we show that the screened
local moment exhibits non-monotonic behavior as a function of U for weak Kondo
coupling J_K. Secondly the temperature dependence of the susceptibility
obtained from FTLM allows to extract the dependence of the characteristic Kondo
temperature scale T* on the correlation strength U. A monotonic increase of T*
for small U is found resolving the ambiguity from earlier investigations. In
the large U limit the model is equivalent to the 2D Kondo necklace model with
two types of localized spins. In this limit the numerical results can be
compared to those of the analytical bond operator method in mean field
treatment and excellent agreement for the total paramagnetic moment is found,
supporting the reliability of both methods.

of noisy 1-bit observations. Instead of observing a subset of the real-valued
entries of a matrix M, we obtain a small number of binary (1-bit) measurements
generated according to a probability distribution determined by the real-valued
entries of M. The central question we ask is whether or not it is possible to
obtain an accurate estimate of M from this data. In general this would seem
impossible, but we show that the maximum likelihood estimate under a suitable
constraint returns an accurate estimate of M when ||M||_{\infty} <= \alpha, and
rank(M) <= r. If the log-likelihood is a concave function (e.g., the logistic
or probit observation models), then we can obtain this maximum likelihood
estimate by optimizing a convex program. In addition, we also show that if
instead of recovering M we simply wish to obtain an estimate of the
distribution generating the 1-bit measurements, then we can eliminate the
requirement that ||M||_{\infty} <= \alpha. For both cases, we provide lower
bounds showing that these estimates are near-optimal. We conclude with a suite
of experiments that both verify the implications of our theorems as well as
illustrate some of the practical applications of 1-bit matrix completion. In
particular, we compare our program to standard matrix completion methods on
movie rating data in which users submit ratings from 1 to 5. In order to use
our program, we quantize this data to a single bit, but we allow the standard

does not vanish at 1 (i.e., the Kawasaki identity fails) and does not have the
celebrated ES/GC symmetry. The FCS, VAR and interpolating functionals always
have this symmetry. In the cases where h is a Schr\""odinger operator, the

measurements below 100 K, only one phase transition is found in the temperature
range from 2 to 750 K corresponding to long-range antiferromagnetic order below
T_N ~ 273 K. Many of the low temperature properties can be explained by the
thermal depopulation of carriers from the conduction band into a low mobility
band located approximately 16 meV below the conduction band edge, as deduced
from the Hall effect data. In analogy with what occurs in Ge, the low mobility
band is likely an impurity band. The Seebeck coefficient, S, is large and
negative for temperatures from 2 to 300 K ranging from ~ -70\muV/K at 300 K to
-4500\muV/K at 18 K. A large maximum in |S| at 18 K is likely due to phonon
drag with the abrupt drop in |S| below 18 K due to the thermal depopulation of
the high mobility conduction band. The large thermal conductivity between 10
and 20 K (~350 W/m/K) is consistent with this interpretation, as are detailed
calculations of the Seebeck coefficient made using the complete calculated
electronic structure. These data are compared to data reported for FeSb2, which

Telescopio Canarias under very poor weather conditions. These objects display
variability in the optical, infrared, Halpha, and/or X-rays on time scales of

classification of equivariant wave maps with trajectories that are pre-compact
in the energy space up to the scaling symmetry of the equation. Indeed, a wave
map of this type can only be either 0 or Q up to a rescaling. This gives a
proof in the equivariant case of a refined version of the threshold conjecture

The aforementioned global existence and scattering statement can also be

  For wave maps of topological degree one, we establish a classification of
solutions blowing up in finite time with energies less than three times the

allowing crowd-sourcing applications to scale, i.e., to handle larger datasets
at lower costs. The key observation is that, in many of the above tasks, humans
and machine learning algorithms can be complementary, as humans are often more
accurate but slow and expensive, while algorithms are usually less accurate,
but faster and cheaper.
  Based on this observation, we present two new active learning algorithms to
combine humans and algorithms together in a crowd-sourced database. Our
algorithms are based on the theory of non-parametric bootstrap, which makes our
results applicable to a broad class of machine learning models. Our results, on
three real-life datasets collected with Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and on 15
well-known UCI data sets, show that our methods on average ask humans to label
one to two orders of magnitude fewer items to achieve the same accuracy as a
baseline that labels random images, and two to eight times fewer questions than
previous active learning schemes.

very difficult for direct calculations of the state of cold matter at realistic
baryon number densities inside compact stars. Nevertheless, from an
observational point of view, it is conjectured that pulsars could be made up of
quark clusters since the strong coupling between quarks might render quarks
grouped in clusters. We are trying an effort to find an equation of state of
condensed quark-cluster matter in a phenomenological way. Supposing that the
quark-clusters could be analogized to inert gases, we apply here the
corresponding-state approach to derive the equation of state of quark-cluster
matter, as was similarly demonstrated for nuclear and neutron-star matter in
1970s. According to the calculations presented, the quark-cluster stars, which
are composed of quark-cluster matter, could then have high maximum mass that is
consistent with observations and, in turn, further observations of pulsar mass
would also put constraints to the properties of quark-cluster matter. Moreover,
the melting heat during solid-liquid phase conversion and the related
astrophysical consequences are also briefly discussed.

covariance is the inverse of a graph Laplacian. Minimizing the trace of the

batch active learning classification problems with budget constraints. However,
its worst-case bound has been missing. We show that the V-optimality on GRFs as
a function of the batch query set is submodular and hence its greedy selection
algorithm guarantees an (1-1/e) approximation ratio. Moreover, GRF models have
the absence-of-suppressor (AofS) condition. For active survey problems, we

It is a form of art dealing with the organization of tones into patterns.

note that sounds the same as the one you started off with, but at a higher or
lower pitch. It was discovered by Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher who lived
around 500 BC, that the note an octave higher than another has a frequency
twice high. The notes that sound harmonious together have simple rational
number ratios between their frequencies.

the presence of a fluid that wields an anisotropic equation of state (EoS)
parameter in general relativity. We present two accelerating dark energy (DE)
models with an anisotropic fluid in Bianchi type-$VI_{0}$ space-time. To
prevail the deterministic solution we choose the scale factor $a(t) =
\sqrt{t^{n}e^{t}}$, which yields a time-dependent deceleration parameter (DP),
representing a class of models which generate a transition of the universe from
the early decelerating phase to the recent accelerating phase. Under the
suitable condition, the anisotropic models approach to isotropic scenario. The
EoS for dark energy $\omega$ is found to be time-dependent and its existing
range for derived models is in good agreement with the recent observations of
SNe Ia data (Knop et al. 2003), SNe Ia data with CMBR anisotropy and galaxy
clustering statistics (Tegmark et al. 2004) and latest combination of
cosmological datasets coming from CMB anisotropies, luminosity distances of
high redshift type Ia supernovae and galaxy clustering (Hinshaw et al. 2009;

physically viable DE models.The cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is found to be
a positive decreasing function of time and it approaches to a small positive
value at late time (i.e. the present epoch) which is corroborated by results
from recent type Ia supernovae observations. We also observe that our solutions
are stable. The physical and geometric aspects of both the models are also
discussed in detail.

encourage social conversations/exchanges and the ability to connect and
communicate with peers, partners, customers and other stakeholders anytime,
anywhere which drives the need of mobile-enable, the existing enterprise
applications. This paper highlights a distinct set of needs and key customer
challenges that must be considered and addressed for deployment of Social
Collaboration applications and Mobility services in enterprises. It not only
addresses the Critical Success Factors for enterprise mobility enablement but
also outlines the unique business requirements to rapidly create social
collaboration culture and the discipline of turning social data into meaningful
insights to drive business decisions in real-time. Moreover, the paper
emphasizes on developing composite offerings on social enterprise and Mobile
networks that not only offer the value proposition in terms of financially
oriented results, but also help customer to maximize return on investment
(ROI).

relation due to the Lorentz invariance violation corrections is suggested. The
equation is formulated in the 16-component first- order form. I have obtained
the projection matrix extracting solutions of the equation with definite spin
projections which can be considered as the density matrix for pure spin states.
Exact solutions of the equation are found for particles in the external
constant and uniform magnetic field. The synchrotron radiation radius within
the novel modified Dirac equation is estimated.
