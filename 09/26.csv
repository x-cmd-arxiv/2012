strong coupling between the two transverse degrees of freedom. The required
strength of the circuit of skew quadrupole magnets used to correct for
coupling, though capable, had increased by an order of magnitude since 1983.
Changes made to the Tevatron for colliding beams operation had altered the skew
quadrupole corrector distribution and strong coupling became evident, often
encumbering routine operation during the colliding beam physics run. It was
discovered that the superconducting coils of the main dipole magnets had become
vertically displaced relative to their yokes since their construction. The
ensuing systematic skew quadrupole field introduced by this displacement
accounts for the required corrector settings and observed beam behavior. The
magnets were adjusted in situ over the course of several long maintenance
periods and the Tevatron performance improved as a result.

of tomorrow. It is revolutionary, not only because it will enable peak load
shaving and will add resources to manage large distribution systems, but mainly
because it will tap into an almost unexplored and extremely powerful pool of
resources comprised of many small individual consumers on distribution grids.
However, to utilize these resources effectively, the methods used to engage
these resources must yield accurate and reliable control. A diversity of
methods have been proposed to engage these new resources. As opposed to direct
load control, many methods rely on consumers and/or loads responding to
exogenous signals, typically in the form of energy pricing, originating from
the utility or system operator. Here, we propose an open loop
communication-lite method for estimating the price elasticity of many customers
comprising a distribution system. We utilize a sparse linear regression method
that relies on operator-controlled, inhomogeneous minor price variations, which
will be fair to all the consumers. Our numerical experiments show that reliable
estimation of individual and thus aggregated instantaneous elasticities is
possible. We describe the limits of the reliable reconstruction as functions of
the three key parameters of the system: (i) ratio of the number of
communication slots (time units) per number of engaged consumers; (ii) level of
sparsity (in consumer response); and (iii) signal-to-noise ratio.

models and structure formation scenarios. In particular, the largest structures
discovered observationally are thought to carry critical information on the
amplitude of large-scale density fluctuations or homogeneity of the universe,
and have often challenged the standard cosmological framework. The Sloan Great
Wall (SGW) recently found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) region casts
doubt on the concordance cosmological model with a cosmological constant (i.e.
the flat LCDM model). Here we show that the existence of the SGW is perfectly
consistent with the LCDM model, a result that only our very large cosmological
N-body simulation (the Horizon Run 2, HR2) could supply. In addition, we report
on the discovery of a void complex in the SDSS much larger than the SGW, and
show that such size of the largest void is also predicted in the LCDM paradigm.
Our results demonstrate that an initially homogeneous isotropic universe with
primordial Gaussian random phase density fluctuations growing in accordance
with the General Relativity, can explain the richness and size of the observed
large-scale structures in the SDSS. Using the HR2 simulation we predict that a
future galaxy redshift survey about four times deeper or with 3 magnitude
fainter limit than the SDSS should reveal a largest structure of bright
galaxies about twice as big as the SGW.

pulse length.
  The 10 m emittance measurement straight exploits and begins at the 12' shield
wall that separates the MTA Experimental Hall and beamline stub from the Linac
enclosure. A quadrupole triplet has been installed upstream of the shield wall
in order to focus a large, 1.5-2"" (~95% width) beam through the shield wall and
onto a profile monitor located at the exit of the shielding. Another profile
monitor has been installed upstream of the shield wall, ~5 m upstream of the
central, or focal-point monitor. With the triplet, a small, 0.2-0.5"" spot size

a center profile monitor reduces the number of unknown linear optical
parameters to two Courant-Snyder parameters, {\beta} and {\epsilon}, since,

current observational methods of determining the mass profile, gravitational
lensing and the caustic technique, are independent of the assumption of
dynamical equilibrium. Both techniques enable determination of the extended
mass profile at radii beyond the virial radius. For 19 clusters, we compare the
mass profile based on the caustic technique with weak lensing measurements
taken from the literature. This comparison offers a test of systematic issues
in both techniques. Around the virial radius, the two methods of mass
estimation agree to within about 30%, consistent with the expected errors in
the individual techniques. At small radii, the caustic technique overestimates
the mass as expected from numerical simulations. The ratio between the lensing
profile and the caustic mass profile at these radii suggests that the weak
lensing profiles are a good representation of the true mass profile. At radii
larger than the virial radius, the lensing mass profile exceeds the caustic
mass profile possibly as a result of contamination of the lensing profile by
large-scale structures within the lensing kernel. We highlight the case of the
closely neighboring clusters MS0906+11 and A750 to illustrate the potential
seriousness of contamination of the the weak lensing signal by unrelated
structures.

After subtracting the synchrotron and line emission, the remaining far-infrared
continuum can be fit with two dust components. Assuming standard interstellar
silicates, the mass of the cooler component is 0.24(+0.32)(-0.08) Msolar for T

dust with T = 33.8(+2.3)(-1.8) K. A single temperature modified-blackbody with
0.14Msolar and 0.08Msolar for silicate and carbon dust respectively, provides
an adequate fit to the far- infrared region of the spectral energy distribution

stochastic dynamical systems with agents of the following mixed types: (i) a

The major and minor (MM) agents are coupled via both: (i) their individual
nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii) their individual finite time horizon
nonlinear cost functions. This problem is approached by the so-called
$\epsilon$-Nash Mean Field Game ($\epsilon$-NMFG) theory. A distinct feature of
the mixed agent MFG problem is that even asymptotically (as the population size
$N$ approaches infinity) the noise process of the major agent causes random
fluctuation of the mean field behaviour of the minor agents. To deal with this,
the overall asymptotic ($N \rightarrow \infty$) mean field game problem is
decomposed into: (i) two non-standard stochastic optimal control problems with
random coefficient processes which yield forward adapted stochastic best
response control processes determined from the solution of (backward in time)
stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (SHJB) equations, and (ii) two stochastic
coefficient McKean-Vlasov (SMV) equations which characterize the state of the
major agent and the measure determining the mean field behaviour of the minor
agents. Existence and uniqueness of the solution to the Stochastic Mean Field
Game (SMFG) system (SHJB and SMV equations) is established by a fixed point
argument in the Wasserstein space of random probability measures. In the case
that minor agents are coupled to the major agent only through their cost
functions, the $\epsilon_N$-Nash equilibrium property of the SMFG best
responses is shown for a finite $N$ population system where
$\epsilon_N=O(1/\sqrt N)$.

are within the admissible range $p\leq2(n+1)/(n+3)$ and $q\geq2(n+1)/(n-1)$ and
$\zeta$ is outside a parabola opening to the right and a small disk centered at
the origin. This naturally generalizes the previous results in \cite{Kenig} and
\cite{bssy} which addressed only the special case when $p=2n/(n+2),
q=2n/(n-2)$. Using the shrinking spectral estimates between $L^p$ and $L^q$ we
also show that when $(p,q)$ are within the interior of the admissible range,
one can obtain a logarithmic improvement over the parabolic region for
resolvent estimates on manifolds equipped with Riemannian metric of
non-positive sectional curvature, and a power improvement depending on the
exponent $(p,q)$ for flat torus. The latter therefore partially improves Shen's
work in \cite{Shen} on the $L^p\to L^2$ uniform resolvent estimates on the
torus. Similar to the case as proved in \cite{bssy} when
$(p,q)=(2n/(n+2),2n/(n-2))$, the parabolic region is also optimal over the
round sphere $S^n$ when $(p,q)$ are now in the admissible range. However, we
may ask if the admissible range is sharp in the sense that it is the only
possible range on the Sobolev line for which a compact manifold can have
uniform resolvent estimate for $\zeta$ being ouside a parabola.

compared to measure the global properties of acoustic modes and their
individual frequencies from the photometric data of CoRoT. The new
spectroscopic observations and archival astrometric values suggest that
HD169392 is a wide binary system weakly bounded. We have obtained the
spectroscopic parameters for both components, suggesting the origin from the
same cloud. However, only the mode signature of HD169392 A has been measured
within the CoRoT data. The signal-to-noise ratio of the modes in HD169392B is
too low to allow any confident detection. We were able to extract mode
parameters of modes for l=0, 1, 2, and 3. The study of the splittings and
inclination angle gives two possible solutions with splittings and inclination
angles of 0.4-1.0 muHz and 20-40 degrees for one case and 0.2-0.5 muHz and
55-86 degrees for the other case. The modeling of this star with the
Asteroseismic Modeling Portal led to a mass of 1.15+/-0.01 Ms, a radius of
1.88+/-0.02 Rs, and an age of 4.33+/-0.12 Gyr, where the uncertainties are the

action from SU(N) lattice gauge theories, with or without matter fields. The
method can be used to find the variation of the effective Polyakov line action
along any trajectory in field configuration space; this information is
sufficient to determine the potential term in the action, and strongly
constrains the possible form of the kinetic term. The technique is illustrated
for both pure and gauge-Higgs SU(2) lattice gauge theory at finite temperature.
A surprise, in the pure gauge theory, is that the potential of the
corresponding Polyakov line action contains a non-analytic (yet
center-symmetric) term proportional to |P|^3, where P is the trace of the
Polyakov line at a given point, in addition to the expected analytic terms
proportional to even powers of P.

electronic effects using pseudospectral methods is key to PAMELA's efficiency,
resulting in significantly reduced computational effort compared to
finite-element methods. In contrast to the new nonlocal exchange formalism
implemented in this work, we find that the simple, conventional
Schrodinger-Poisson approaches commonly used in the literature (1) considerably
overestimate the number of occupied electron levels, (2) overdelocalize
electrons in nanowires, and (3) significantly underestimate the relative energy
separation between electronic subbands. In addition, we perform several
calculations in the high-doping regime that show a critical tunneling depth
exists in these nanosystems where tunneling from the core-shell interface to
the nanowire edge becomes the dominant mechanism of electron gas formation.
Finally, in order to present a general-purpose set of tools that both
experimentalists and theorists can easily use to predict electron gas formation

representation by use of lattice simulations with staggered fermions. With a
non-improved action we observe a chiral zero-temperature (bulk) transition
separating a region at weak coupling, where chiral symmetry is realized, from a
region at strong coupling where chiral symmetry is broken. With improved
actions, a more complicated pattern emerges, and in particular two first order
transitions in the chiral limit appear. We observe that at sufficiently strong
coupling the next-to-nearest neighbor terms of the improved lattice action are
no longer irrelevant and can indeed modify the pattern observed without
improvement. Baryon number conservation can be realized in an unusual way,
allowing for an otherwise prohibited oscillating term in the pseudoscalar
channel. We discuss the phenomenon by means of explicit examples borrowed from
statistical mechanics. Finally, these observations can also be useful when
simulating other strongly coupled systems on the lattice, such as graphene.

transfer calculations, we have estimated the theoretical cross power spectrum
between galaxies and the 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen during the epoch
of reionization. In accordance with previous studies, we find that the 21cm
emission is initially correlated with halos on large scales (> 30 Mpc),
anti-correlated on intermediate (~ 5 Mpc), and uncorrelated on small (< 3 Mpc)
scales. This picture quickly changes as reionization proceeds and the two
fields become anti-correlated on large scales. The normalization of the cross
power spectrum can be used to set constraints on the average neutral fraction
in the intergalactic medium and its shape can be a tool to study the topology
of reionization. When we apply a drop-out technique to select galaxies and add
to the 21cm signal the noise expected from the LOFAR telescope, we find that
while the normalization of the cross power spectrum remains a useful tool for
probing reionization, its shape becomes too noisy to be informative. On the
other hand, for a Lyalpha Emitter (LAE) survey both the normalization and the
shape of the cross power spectrum are suitable probes of reionization. A closer
look at a specific planned LAE observing program using Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam
reveals concerns about the strength of the 21cm signal at the planned
redshifts. If the ionized fraction at z ~ 7 is lower that the one estimated
here, then using the cross power spectrum may be a useful exercise given that
at higher redshifts and neutral fractions it is able to distinguish between two
toy models with different topologies.

oscillations have been posited to be the superposition of resonant kink waves.
To date, most analyses of these oscillations have concentrated on calculating
the frequency shifts that result from spatial variation in the kink wave speed.
Further, most have ignored gravity and treated the loop as a straight tube.
Here we ignore spatial variation in the wave speed, but self-consistently
include the effects of gravity and loop curvature in both the equilibrium loop
model and in the wave equation. We model a coronal loop as an isolated, thin,
magnetic fibril that is anchored at two points in the photosphere. The
equilibrium shape of the loop is determined by a balance between magnetic
buoyancy and magnetic tension, which is characterized by a Magnetic Bond Number
\epsilon, that is typically small |\epsilon| << 1. This balance produces a loop
that has a variable radius of curvature. The resonant kink waves of such a loop
come in two polarizations that are decoupled from each other: waves with motion
completely within the plane of the loop (normal oscillations) and waves with
motions that are completely horizontal, perpendicular to the plane of the loop
(binormal oscillations). We solve for the eigensolutions of both polarizations
using perturbation theory for small Magnetic Bond Number. For modes of the same
order, normal oscillations have smaller eigenfrequencies than binormal
oscillations. The additional forces of buoyancy and magnetic tension from the
curvature of the loop increase and decrease the mode frequencies, respectively.
The ratio of the frequencies of the first overtone to the fundamental mode is
modified by the inclusion of buoyancy and curvature. We find that the normal
polarization possesses a frequency ratio that exceeds the canonical value of 2,
whereas the binormal polarization has a ratio less than 2.

~10x to ~50x. This enables us to identify resolved star-forming HII regions at

comparisons with equivalent samples at z ~ 2 and in the local Universe. We find
evolution in the both luminosity and surface brightness of HII regions with
redshift. The distribution of clump properties can be quantified with an HII
region luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law with an exponential
break at some cut-off, and we find that the cut-off evolves with redshift. We
therefore conclude that `clumpy' galaxies are seen at high redshift because of
the evolution of the cut-off mass; the galaxies themselves follow similar

brighter and thus appear as clumps which dominate the morphology of the galaxy.

galaxies are driven by the competing effects of higher gas fractions causing
perturbations on larger scales, partially compensated by higher epicyclic
frequencies which stabilise the disk.

which the sublattice labelling is fixed beforehand and another in which the

out of the (pi,pi) Neel phase and largely inherits its Marshall sign structure;
on the other hand, the transition from the magnetically ordered (pi,0) phase is
strongly first order and involves an abrupt change in the sign structure and
spatial symmetry as the results of a level crossing.

cosmic acceleration in dedicated N-body simulations. Truly massive dark
matter-only simulations are being conducted on national supercomputing centers,
employing from several billion to over half a trillion particles to simulate
the formation and evolution of cosmologically representative volumes (cosmic

internationally diverse, with top simulations having been run in China, France,
Germany, Korea, Spain, and the USA. Predictions from such simulations touch on
almost every aspect of dark matter and dark energy studies, and we give a
comprehensive overview of this connection. We also discuss the limitations of
the cold and collisionless DM-only approach, and describe in some detail

in order to prevent catastrophic cooling, the ICM must be heated in a
near-isotropic fashion and narrow bipolar jets with $P_{\rm jet}=10^{44-45}$
ergs/s, typical of radio AGNs at cluster centres, are inefficient at heating
the gas in the transverse direction to the jets. We argue that due to existent
conditions in cluster cores, the SMBHs will, in addition to accreting gas via
radiatively inefficient flows, experience short stochastic episodes of enhanced
accretion via thin discs. In general, the orientation of these accretion discs
will be misaligned with the spin axis of the black holes and the ensuing
torques will cause the black hole's spin axis (and therefore, the jet axis) to
slew and rapidly change direction. This model not only explains recent
observations showing successive generations of jet-lobes-bubbles in individual
cool-core clusters that are offset from each other in the angular direction
with respect to the cluster center, but also shows that AGN jets {\it can} heat
the cluster core nearly isotropically on the gas cooling timescale. Our model
{\it does} require that the SMBHs at the centers of cool-core clusters be
spinning relatively slowly. Torques from individual misaligned discs are
ineffective at tilting rapidly spinning black holes by more than a few degrees.
Additionally, since SMBHs that host thin accretion discs will manifest as
quasars, we predict that roughly 1--2 rich clusters within $z<0.5$ should have
quasars at their centers.

exhibit significant mid-infrared (mid-IR) variability. A wide range of physical
mechanisms may be responsible for these variations, including changes in a
YSO's accretion rate or in the extinction or emission from the inner disk. We
have obtained and analyzed multi-epoch near-infrared (NIR) spectra for five
actively accreting YSOs in the $\rho$ Oph star-forming region along with
contemporaneous mid-IR light curves obtained as part of the YSOVAR Spitzer/IRAC
survey. Four of the five YSOs exhibit mid-IR light curves with modest ($\sim
0.2$--0.4 mag) but statistically significant variations over our 40-day
observation window. Measuring the strengths of prominent photospheric
absorption lines and accretion sensitive \ion{H}{1} and \ion{He}{1} lines in
each NIR spectrum, we derive estimates of each YSO's spectral type, effective
temperature ({\Teff}), and $H$ band extinction ($A_H$), and analyze the time
evolution of their NIR veiling ($r_H$ and $r_K$) and mass accretion rates
({\Macc}). Defining a YSO's evolutionary stage such that heavily veiled, high
accretion rate objects are less evolved than those with lower levels of veiling
and ongoing accretion, we infer that GY 314 is the most evolved YSO in our
sample, with GY 308 and GY 292 at progressively earlier evolutionary stages.
Leveraging our multi-epoch, multi-wavelength dataset, we detect significant
variations in mass accretion rates over timescales of days to weeks, but find
that extinction levels in these YSOs remain relatively constant. We find no
correlation between these YSO mid-IR light curves and time-resolved veiling or
mass accretion rates, such that we are unable to link their mid-IR variability
with physical processes localized near the inner edge of the circumstellar disk
or within regions which are directly responsive to mass accretion...

decouple from the standard model plasma very early in the history of the

Atomic Dark Matter model, in which two fermions oppositely charged under a new
U(1) dark force are initially coupled to a thermal bath of ""dark photons"" but
eventually recombine into neutral atom-like bound states and begin forming
gravitationally-bound structures. As dark atoms have (dark) atom-sized
geometric cross sections, this model also provides an example of
self-interacting DM with a velocity-dependent cross section. Delayed kinetic
decoupling in this scenario predicts novel DM properties on small scales but
retains the success of cold DM on larger scales. We calculate the atomic
physics necessary to capture the thermal history of this dark sector and show
significant improvements over the standard atomic hydrogen calculation are

atomic DM scenario on the matter power spectrum and the cosmic microwave

Dark-Acoustic-Oscillation (DAO) scale, on the matter density field. This DAO
scale shapes the small-scale matter power spectrum and determines the minimal
DM halo mass at late times which may be many orders of magnitude larger than in
a typical WIMP scenario. This model necessarily includes an extra dark

expectations from models of Galactic Li production. NGC 6253 is also compared

repeats (VNTRs) are known to be polymorphic within species but the influence of
their instability in molecular interactions remains unclear. VNTRs are
overrepresented in encoding sequence of particular functional groups where
their presence could influence protein interactions. Using human consensus
coding sequence, this work examines if genomic instability, determined by
regions of VNTRs, influences the number of protein interactions. Findings
reveal that, in relation to protein function, the frequency of unique
interactions in human proteins increase with the number of repeated regions.
This supports experimental evidence that repeat expansion may lead to an
increase in molecular interactions. Genetic diversity, estimated by Ka/Ks,
appeared to decrease as the number of protein-protein interactions increased.
Additionally, G+C and CpG content were negatively correlated with increasing
occurrence of VNTRs. This may indicate that nucleotide composition along with
selective processes can increase genomic stability and thereby restrict the
expansion of repeated regions. Proteins involved in acetylation are associated
with a high number of repeated regions and interactions but a low G+C and CpG
content. While in contrast, less interactive membrane proteins contain a lower
number of repeated regions but higher levels of C+G and CpGs. This work
provides further evidence that VNTRs may provide the genetic variability to

both OH maser and radio continuum emission (hereafter OHPNe). These have been
proposed to be very young PNe, and therefore, they could be key objects for
understanding the formation and evolution of PNe. Methods. We consulted the
literature searching for interferometric observations of radio continuum and OH
masers toward evolved stars, including the information from several surveys. We
also processed radio continuum and OH maser observations toward PNe in the Very
Large Array data archive. The high positional accuracy provided by
interferometric observations allow us to confirm or reject the association
between OH maser and radio continuum emission. Results. We found a total of six
PNe that present both OH maser and radio continuum emissions, as confirmed with
radio interferometric observations. These are bona fide OHPNe. The confirmed
OHPNe present a bipolar morphology in resolved images of their ionized emission
at different wavelengths, suggesting that the OH maser emission in PNe is
related to nonspherical mass-loss phenomena. The OH maser spectra in PNe
present a clear asymmetry, tending to show blueshifted emission with respect to
the systemic velocity. Their infrared colors suggest that most of these objects
are very young PNe. OHPNe do not form a homogeneous group, and seem to
represent a variety of different evolutionary stages. We suggest that OH masers
pumped in the AGB phase may disappear during the post-AGB phase, but reappear
once the source becomes a PN and its radio continuum emission is amplified by
the OH molecules. Therefore, OH maser emission could last significantly longer
than the previously assumed 1000 yr after the end of the AGB phase. This maser
lifetime may be longer in PNe with more massive central stars, which ionize a
larger amount of gas in the envelope.

low-parametric ODE model of the feeder. We also explain how the homogeneous ODE
modeling is generalized to account for other distributed effects, e.g. for
inverter based and voltage dependent control of reactive power. The resulting
system of the DistFlow-ODEs, relating homogenized voltage to flows of real and
reactive power along the lines, admits computationally efficient analysis in
terms of the minimal number of the feeder line ""media"" parameters, such as the
ratio of the inductance-to-resistance densities. Exploring the space of the

of the system performance, in particular expressed in terms of the voltage drop
along the feeder, power import/export from the feeder line as the whole, power
losses within the feeder, and critical (with respect to possible voltage
collapse) length of the feeder. Our most surprising funding relates to
performance of a feeder rich on PhotoVoltaic (PV) systems during a sunny day.

This risk arises because OPF dispatch is computed without awareness of major
uncertainty, in particular fluctuations in renewable output. As a result, grid
operation under OPF with renewable variability can lead to frequent conditions
where power line flow ratings are significantly exceeded. Such a condition,
which is borne by simulations of real grids, would likely resulting in
automatic line tripping to protect lines from thermal stress, a risky and
undesirable outcome which compromises stability. Smart grid goals include a
commitment to large penetration of highly fluctuating renewables, thus calling

decay into supersymmetric particles as well as into quarks. If the gravitino
mass is small compared to the typical interaction energy, the longitudinal

implies that two such curves over k have the same zeta function (i.e., the same
number of points over all extensions of k) if and only if their corresponding
Jacobians are isogenous. We remedy this situation by showing that if, instead
of just the zeta function, all Dirichlet L-series of the two curves are equal
via an isomorphism of their Dirichlet character groups, then the curves are
isomorphic up to ""Frobenius twists"", i.e., up to automorphisms of the ground

weighted point counting determines a curve. In a sense, the result solves the

Time-dependent, 3D radiation transfer calculations are important for
the modeling of a variety of objects, from supernovae and novae to simulations

in time. Aims. We extend our 3D radiative transfer framework to include direct
time dependence of the radiation field; i.e., the $\partial I/ \partial t$
terms are fully considered in the solution of radiative transfer problems.
Methods. We build on the framework that we have described in previous papers in
this series and develop a subvoxel method for the $\partial I/\partial t$
terms. Results. We test the implementation by comparing the 3D results to our
well tested 1D time dependent radiative transfer code in spherical symmetry. A
simple 3D test model is also presented. Conclusions. The 3D time dependent

guide, we determine the underlying structural skeleton of the configuration,

particular, several pseudo-streamers in the regions where the eruptions
occurred. Of special interest to us are the magnetic null points and separators
associated with the pseudo-streamers. We propose that magnetic reconnection
triggered along these separators by the first eruption likely played a key role
in establishing the assumed link between the sequential eruptions. The present
work substantiates our recent simplified magnetohydrodynamic model of
sympathetic eruptions and provides a guide for further deeper study of these

many accretion tracers currently used to measure the mass accretion rate in
low-mass, young stars. We use our spectra to measure the accretion luminosity
from the continuum excess emission in the UV and visual; the derived mass
accretion rates range from 10$^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ down to
5$\times10^{-11}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, allowing us to investigate the
behavior of the accretion-driven emission lines in very-low mass accretion rate
regimes. We compute the luminosity of ten accretion-driven emission lines, from
the UV to the near-IR, obtained simultaneously. Most of the secondary tracers
correlate well with the accretion luminosity derived from the continuum excess
emission. We confirm the validity of the correlations between accretion
luminosities and line luminosities given in the literature, with the possible
exception of H\alpha. When looking at individual objects, we find that the
Hydrogen recombination lines, from the UV to the near-IR, give good and
consistent measurements of accretion luminosities, often in better agreement
than the uncertainties introduced by the adopted correlations. The average
accretion luminosity derived from several Hydrogen lines, measured
simultaneously, have a much reduced error. This suggests that some of the
spread in the literature correlations may be due to the use of non-simultaneous
observations of lines and continuum. Three stars in our sample deviate from
this behavior, and we discuss them individually.

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) for broadband wireless
communication systems. Bit-Interleaved Coded Multiple Beamforming (BICMB) can
achieve both spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing for flat fading MIMO
channels. For frequency selective fading MIMO channels, BICMB with OFDM
(BICMB-OFDM) can be employed to provide both spatial diversity and multipath
diversity, making it an important technique. In our previous work, the
subcarrier grouping technique was applied to combat the negative effect of
subcarrier correlation. It was also proved that full diversity of BICMB-OFDM
with Subcarrier Grouping (BICMB-OFDM-SG) can be achieved within the condition
R_cSL<=1, where R_c, S, and L are the code rate, the number of parallel streams
at each subcarrier, and the number of channel taps, respectively. The full
diversity condition implies that if S increases, R_c may have to decrease to
maintain full diversity. As a result, increasing the number of parallel streams
may not improve the total transmission rate. In this paper, the precoding
technique is employed to overcome the full diversity restriction issue of
R_cSL<=1 for BICMB-OFDM-SG. First, the diversity analysis of precoded
BICMB-OFDM-SG is carried out. Then, the full-diversity precoding design is
developed with the minimum achievable decoding complexity.

content into memories at the end users. Conventionally, these memories are used
to deliver requested content in part from a locally cached copy rather than
through the network. The gain offered by this approach, which we term local
caching gain, depends on the local cache size (i.e, the memory available at
each individual user). In this paper, we introduce and exploit a second,
global, caching gain not utilized by conventional caching schemes. This gain
depends on the aggregate global cache size (i.e., the cumulative memory
available at all users), even though there is no cooperation among the users.
  To evaluate and isolate these two gains, we introduce an
information-theoretic formulation of the caching problem focusing on its basic
structure. For this setting, we propose a novel coded caching scheme that
exploits both local and global caching gains, leading to a multiplicative
improvement in the peak rate compared to previously known schemes. In
particular, the improvement can be on the order of the number of users in the
network. Moreover, we argue that the performance of the proposed scheme is
within a constant factor of the information-theoretic optimum for all values of
the problem parameters.

academic and non-academic research. The increase in the number of published
papers each year makes manual search inefficient and furthermore insufficient.
Hence, automatized methods such as search engines have been of interest in the
last thirty years. Unfortunately, these traditional engines use keyword-based
approaches to solve the search problem, but these approaches are prone to
ambiguity and synonymy. On the other hand, bibliographic search techniques
based only on the citation information are not prone to these problems since
they do not consider textual similarity. For many particular research areas and
topics, the amount of knowledge to humankind is immense, and obtaining the
desired information is as hard as looking for a needle in a haystack.
Furthermore, sometimes, what we are looking for is a set of documents where
each one is different than the others, but at the same time, as a whole we want
them to cover all the important parts of the literature relevant to our search.
This paper targets the problem of result diversification in citation-based
bibliographic search. It surveys a set of techniques which aim to find a set of
papers with satisfactory quality and diversity. We enhance these algorithms
with a direction-awareness functionality to allow the users to reach either
old, well-cited, well-known research papers or recent, less-known ones. We also
propose a set of novel techniques for a better diversification of the results.
All the techniques considered are compared by performing a rigorous
experimentation. The results show that some of the proposed techniques are very
successful in practice while performing a search in a bibliographic database.

algorithms for slightly dense graphs. Specifically, we give an algorithm that
runs in $\tilde{O}(m\log n)$ time and generates a sparsifier with
$\tilde{O}(n\log^3{n}/\epsilon^2)$ edges. This implies that a sparsifier with
$O(n\log n/\epsilon^2)$ edges can be computed in $\tilde{O}(m\log n)$ time for
graphs with more than $O(n\log^4 n)$ edges. We also give an $\tilde{O}(m)$ time

polynomially bounded weights, and an $O(m)$ algorithm for unweighted graphs
with more than $n\log^8 n (\log \log n)^3 $ edges and $n\log^{10} n (\log \log

employed to accelerate linear system solvers and algorithms for computing
fundamental eigenvectors of slightly dense SDD matrices.

during the past few years. While one-way relay with a single data flow
introduces loss in spectral efficiency due to its half-duplex operation,
two-way relaying based on wireless network coding regains part of this loss by
simultaneously processing the two data flows. In a broader perspective, the
two-way traffic pattern is rather limited and it is of interest to investigate
other traffic patterns where such a simultaneous processing of information
flows can bring performance advantage. In this paper we consider a scenario
beyond the usual two-way relaying: a four-way relaying, where each of the two
Mobile Stations (MSs) has a two-way connection to the same Base Station (BS),
while each connection is through a dedicated Relay Station (RS). While both RSs
are in the range of the same BS, they are assumed to have antipodal positions
within the cell, such that they do not interfere with each other. We introduce
and analyze a two-phase transmission scheme to serve the four-way traffic
pattern defined in this scenario. Each phase consists of combined broadcast and
multiple access. We analyze the achievable rate region of the new schemes for
two different operational models for the RS, Decode-and-Forward (DF) and
Amplify-and-Forward (AF), respectively. We compare the performance with a
state-of-the-art reference scheme, time sharing is used between the two MSs,
while each MS is served through a two-way relaying scheme. The results indicate
that, when the RS operates in a DF mode, the achievable rate regions are
significantly enlarged. On the other hand, for AF relaying, the gains are
rather modest. The practical implication of the presented work is a novel
insight on how to improve the spatial reuse in wireless cellular networks by
coordinating the transmissions of the antipodal relays.

specific inclination where the central star is effectively screened by the cold
outer parts of a flared disk but the 10 micron radiation of the warm inner disk
can still reach us. We find the disks in sparse stellar associations are
dissipated more slowly than those in denser (cluster) environments. We detect
C_{2}H_{2} rovibrational band around 13.7 micron on the IRS spectrum of
USNO-B120144.7. We find strong signatures of grain growth and crystallization
in all Epsilon Cha members with 10 micron features detected in their IRS

those found using identical or similar methods in the MBM 12, Coronet cluster,
Eta Cha associations, and in the cores to disks (c2d) legacy program. We find
that disks around low-mass young stars show a negative radial gradient in the
mass-averaged grain size and mass fraction of crystalline silicates. A positive
correlation exists between the mass-averaged grain sizes of amorphous silicates
and the accretion rates if the latter is above ~10^{-9} Msun/yr, possibly

several microns in size to sink into the disk interior.

narrow-band Lya line or broad-band continuum colors in recent years. The nature
of the escaping process of photons from these early galaxies is crucial to
understanding galaxy evolution and the cosmic reionization. Here, we
investigate the escape of Lya, non-ionizing UV-continuum (l = 1300 - 1600
angstrom in rest frame), and ionizing photons (l < 912 angstrom) from galaxies
by combining a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation with three-dimensional
multi-wavelength radiative transfer calculations. The galaxies are simulated in
a box of 5^3 h^-3 Mpc^3 with high resolutions using the Aquila initial
condition which reproduces a Milky Way-like galaxy at redshift z=0. We find
that the escape fraction (fesc) of these different photons shows a complex
dependence on redshift and galaxy properties: fesc(Lya) and fesc(UV) appear to
evolve with redshift, and they show similar, weak correlations with galaxy
properties such as mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust content, while
fesc(Ion) remains roughly constant at ~ 0.2 from z ~ 0 - 10, and it does not
show clear dependence on galaxy properties. fesc(Lya) correlates more strongly
with fesc(UV) than with fesc(Ion). In addition, we find a relation between the
emergent Lya luminosity and the ionizing photon emissivity of Lyman Alpha
Emitters (LAEs). By combining this relation with the observed luminosity
functions of LAEs at different redshift, we estimate the contribution from LAEs
to the reionization of intergalactic medium (IGM). Our result suggests that
ionizing photons from LAEs alone are not sufficient to ionize IGM at z > 6, but
they can maintain the ionization of IGM at z ~ 0 - 5.

ultraviolet (UV) light emitted by recently formed massive stars is attenuated
by dust, which is also produced by star formation (SF) activity, and is
reemitted at mid- and far- infrared (IR) wavelengths. In this study, we
investigate the star formation rate (SFR) and dust extinction using UV and IR
data. We selected local galaxies which are detected at AKARI FIS 90 um and
matched the IRAS IIFSCz 60 um select catalog. We measured FUV and NUV flux
densities from GALEX images. We examined the SF and extinction of Local
galaxies using four bands of AKARI. Then, we calculated FUV and total IR
luminosities, and obtained the SF luminosity, L_{SF}, the total luminosity
related to star formation activity, and the SFR. We find that in most galaxies,
L_{SF} is dominated by L_{dust}. We also find that galaxies with higher SF
activity have a higher fraction of their SF hidden by dust. In fact, the SF of
galaxies with SFRs >20 M_{sun}/yr is almost completely hidden by dust. Our
results boast a significantly higher precision with respect to previously

problems in LDA. As an expedient way for the reliable but massive GWA,
Quasi-Particle-LDA (QPLDA) is proposed by several authors, where the total
computational cost scales with N. Historically, Sham and Kohn introduced the
idea of the local mass operator based on local wavenumber similar to WKB, but
did not execute actual numerical calculations. They took into account exchange
interaction only, from which we could not expect precise treatments anyway.
Later, Pickett and Wang had proposed a more qualitative method and had shown
its potentiality in examples of semiconductors, such as silicon, diamond and
GaP. They used a model analytic formula for the dialectic function and adopted
a model energy dispersion, which is free-electron like one, except that, being
accompanied with an artificial band-gap discontinuity. The latter method has
two shortcomings. First, to execute the calculation, several parameters are
needed, such as the macroscopic dielectric constant and the band gap, which
should be evaluated by the calculation itself, rather than being prepared as
parameters. Second, in their computation of the mass operator, two or three
dimensional numerical integrations are needed on each point of the direct space
mesh, which demand large computational costs in iterative procedures in
determining local wavenumbers and quasi-particle energies. This may be the
reason why QPLDA has not been widely used until now. The present work proposes
a qualitative way of QPLDA which does not need any experimental parameters,
being much speedier than the formalism of Picket and Wang, and more precise
than that of Sham and Kohn. The computational method adopted by the present
work is a modification of the original proposal by Sham and Kohn, rather than
that of Picket and Wang.

demonstrated to render dispersion forces repulsive, or even to switch sign as a
function of separation. Making use of recently available permittivity data
calculated by us we show that such a remarkable non-monotonic Casimir force,
changing from attractive to repulsive as separation increases, can in fact be
observed in systems where constituent materials are in standard NEMS/MEMS use
requiring no special or exotic materials. No such nonmonotonic behaviour has
been measured to date. We calculate the force between a silica sphere and a
flat surface of either zinc oxide or hafnia, two materials which are among the
most prominent for practical microelectrical and microoptical devices. Our
results explicate the need for highly accurate permittivity functions of the
materials involved for frequencies from optical to far-infrared frequencies. A
careful analysis of the Casimir interaction is presented, and we show how the

dependent or causal complex systems. Statistically equivalent causal or
directed graphical models are said to belong to a Markov equivalent class. It
is of great interest to describe and understand the space of such classes.
However, with currently known algorithms, sampling over such classes is only
feasible for graphs with fewer than approximately 20 vertices. In this paper,
we design reversible irreducible Markov chains on the space of Markov
equivalent classes by proposing a perfect set of operators that determine the
transitions of the Markov chain. The stationary distribution of a proposed
Markov chain has a closed form and can be computed easily. Specifically, we
construct a concrete perfect set of operators on sparse Markov equivalence
classes by introducing appropriate conditions on each possible operator.
Algorithms and their accelerated versions are provided to efficiently generate
Markov chains and to explore properties of Markov equivalence classes of sparse
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with thousands of vertices. We find
experimentally that in most Markov equivalence classes of sparse DAGs, (1) most
edges are directed, (2) most undirected subgraphs are small and (3) the number
of these undirected subgraphs grows approximately linearly with the number of
vertices. The article contains supplement arXiv:1303.0632,

thermodynamic response of the gas can be characterized by an effective equation
of state. It determines how gas heats up or cools as it gets compressed, and
hence plays a key role in regulating the process of stellar birth on virtually
all scales, ranging from individual star clusters up to the galaxy as a whole.
We present a systematic study of the impact of thermodynamics on gravitational
collapse in the context of high-redshift star formation, but argue that our
findings are also relevant for present-day star formation in molecular clouds.
  We consider a polytropic equation of state, P = k rho^Gamma, with both
sub-isothermal exponents Gamma < 1 and super-isothermal exponents Gamma > 1. We
find significant differences between these two cases. For Gamma > 1, pressure
gradients slow down the contraction and lead to the formation of a virialized,
turbulent core. Weak magnetic fields are strongly tangled and efficiently
amplified via the small-scale turbulent dynamo on timescales corresponding to
the eddy-turnover time at the viscous scale. For Gamma < 1, on the other hand,
pressure support is not sufficient for the formation of such a core.
Gravitational contraction proceeds much more rapidly and the flow develops very
strong shocks, creating a network of intersecting sheets and extended
filaments. The resulting magnetic field lines are very coherent and exhibit a
considerable degree of order. Nevertheless, even under these conditions we
still find exponential growth of the magnetic energy density in the kinematic
regime.

explains the late-time cosmic acceleration and passes the local tests, even in
the presence of a light scalar field. In this brief report, we consider the
possibility that wormholes are supported by this hybrid metric-Palatini
gravitational theory. We present here the general conditions for wormhole
solutions according to the null energy conditions at the throat and find
specific examples. In the first solution, we specify the redshift function, the
scalar field and choose the potential that simplifies the modified Klein-Gordon
equation. This solution is not asymptotically flat and needs to be matched to a
vacuum solution. In the second example, by adequately specifying the metric
functions and choosing the scalar field, we find an asymptotically flat
spacetime.

  arXiv:1106.1729, 129 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.SG math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a Hamiltonian action of a compact connected Lie group on a
symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$. Conjecturally, under suitable assumptions
there exists a morphism of cohomological field theories from the equivariant
Gromov-Witten theory of $(M,\omega)$ to the Gromov-Witten theory of the
symplectic quotient. The morphism should be a deformation of the Kirwan map.
The idea, due to D. A. Salamon, is to define such a deformation by counting
gauge equivalence classes of symplectic vortices over the complex plane $C$.
  The present memoir is part of a project whose goal is to make this definition
rigorous. Its main results deal with the symplectically aspherical case. The
first one states that every sequence of equivalence classes of vortices over
the plane has a subsequence that converges to a new type of genus zero stable
map, provided that the energies of the vortices are uniformly bounded. Such a
stable map consists of equivalence classes of vortices over the plane and
holomorphic spheres in the symplectic quotient. The second main result is that
the vertical differential of the vortex equations over the plane (at the level
of gauge equivalence) is a Fredholm operator of a specified index.
  Potentially the quantum Kirwan map can be used to compute the quantum
cohomology of symplectic quotients.

from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1)
Galaxy PMN J0948+0022 (z=0.585). This source is the first NLS1 detected at
energies above 100 MeV and therefore can be considered the prototype of this
emerging new class of gamma-ray emitting active galactic nuclei (AGN). The
observations performed from 2008 August 1 to 2011 December 31 confirmed that
PMN J0948+0022 generates a powerful relativistic jet, able to develop an
isotropic luminosity at gamma-rays of the order of 10^48 erg s^-1, at the level
of powerful quasars. The evolution of the radiation emission of this source in
2009 and 2010 followed the canonical expectations of relativistic jets, with
correlated multiwavelength variability (gamma-rays followed by radio emission
after a few months), but it was difficult to retrieve a similar pattern in the
light curves of 2011. The comparison of gamma-ray spectra before and including
2011 data suggested that there was a softening of the high-energy spectral
slope. We selected five specific epochs to be studied by modelling the
broad-band spectrum, characterised by an outburst at gamma-rays or very
low/high flux at other wavelengths. The observed variability can largely be
explained either by changes in the injected power, the bulk Lorentz factor of
the jet or the electron spectrum. The characteristic time scale of
doubling/halving flux ranges from a few days to a few months, depending on the
frequency and the sampling rate. The shortest doubling time scale at gamma-rays
is 2.3+-0.5 days. These small values underline the need of highly-sampled
multiwavelength campaigns to better understand the physics of these sources.

K^0_{\rm S} \pi^+\pi^-$ and $D \to K^0_{\rm S} K^+ K^-$, is performed to
measure the CP-violating observables $x_{\pm}$ and $y_{\pm}$ which are
sensitive to the CKM angle $\gamma$. The analysis exploits 1.0 $\rm fb^{-1}$ of
data collected by the LHCb experiment. The study makes no model-based
assumption on the variation of the strong phase of the D decay amplitude over
the Dalitz plot, but uses measurements of this quantity from CLEO-c as input.
The values of the parameters are found to be $x_- = (0.0 \pm 4.3 \pm 1.5 \pm
0.6) \times 10^{-2}$, $y_- = (2.7 \pm 5.2 \pm 0.8 \pm 2.3) \times 10^{-2}$,
$x_+ = (-10.3 \pm 4.5 \pm 1.8 \pm 1.4)\times 10^{-2}$ and $y_+ = (-0.9 \pm 3.7
\pm 0.8 \pm 3.0)\times 10^{-2}$. The first, second, and third uncertainties are
the statistical, the experimental systematic, and the error associated with the
precision of the strong-phase parameters measured at CLEO-c, respectively.
These results correspond to $\gamma = (44^{\,+43}_{\,-38})^\circ$, with a
second solution at $\gamma \to \gamma + 180^\circ$, and $r_B = 0.07 \pm 0.04$,
where $r_B$ is the ratio between the suppressed and favoured B decay
amplitudes.

Evidence for a binary-phase dependence of the X-ray emission from the pulsar is

reveals non-thermal X-ray emission of PSR B1957+20, confirming the results of
previous studies. This suggests that the X-rays are mostly due to intra-binary
shock emission which is strongest when the pulsar wind interacts with the

determined in our study. The marginal softening of the spectrum of the

Mn12 units that results in solvent loss immediately after removal of the
crystals from the mother liquor. The electronic structure and the
intramolecular exchange parameters have been calculated. Mn 3d bands of 1 are

approximate those with non-smooth ones. For geometric inverse problems, we can
encounter a similar phenomenon: to understand stability of the solution of
inverse problems for smooth manifolds, we should study the question of
uniqueness for the limiting non-smooth case. Moreover, it is well-known, that a
sequence of smooth $n$-dimensional manifolds can collapse to a non-smooth space
of lower dimension. To analyze the stability of inverse problem in a class of

The kinetic equation for the magnetization is obtained by using linear response
theory. Temperature and also crystal field dependencies of the relaxation time
are obtained in the vicinity of phase transition points. We found that the
relaxation time exhibits divergent treatment near the order-disorder phase
transition point as well as near the isolated critical point whereas it
displays cusp behavior near the first order phase transition point. In

susceptibility response of the system to changing applied field frequencies and
it is observed that the considered disordered magnetic system exhibits unusual

classical method of principal components analysis (PCA) does not efficiently

the idiosyncratic error to be homoskedastic and cross sectionally uncorrelated.
For efficient estimation it is essential to estimate a large error covariance
matrix. We assume the model to be conditionally sparse, and propose two
approaches to estimating the common factors and factor loadings; both are based
on maximizing a Gaussian quasi-likelihood and involve regularizing a large
covariance sparse matrix. In the first approach the factor loadings and the
error covariance are estimated separately while in the second approach they are
estimated jointly. Extensive asymptotic analysis has been carried out. In
particular, we develop the inferential theory for the two-step estimation.

matrix, they produce more efficient estimators than the classical PCA methods

been conjectured to be in the so-called quarkyonic phase, i.e., to have a quark
Fermi surface and on top of it a confined spectrum of excitations. It has been
suggested that the presence of the quark Fermi surface leads to a homogeneous
phase with restored chiral symmetry, which is unstable towards creating
condensates breaking both the chiral and translational symmetry. Motivated by
these exotic features, we investigate properties of cold baryonic matter in the
single flavor Sakai-Sugimoto model searching for a holographic realization of
the quarkyonic phase. We use a simplified mean-field description and focus on
the regime of parametrically large baryon densities, of the order of the square
of the 't Hooft coupling, as they turn out to lead to new physical effects
similar to the ones occurring in the quarkyonic phase. One effect, the
appearance of a particular marginally stable mode breaking translational
invariance and linked with the presence of the Chern-Simons term in the flavor
brane Lagrangian, is known to occur in the deconfined phase of the
Sakai-Sugimoto model, but turns out to be absent here. The other, completely
new phenomenon that we, preliminarily, study using strong simplifying
assumptions are density-enhanced interactions of the flavor brane gauge field
with holographically represented baryons. These seem to significantly affect
the spectrum of vector and axial mesons and might lead to approximate chiral
symmetry restoration in the lowest part of the spectrum, where the mesons start
to qualitatively behave like collective excitations of the dense baryonic
medium. We discuss the relevance of these effects for holographic searches of
the quarkyonic phase and conclude with a discussion of various subtleties
involved in constructing a mean-field holographic description of a dense
baryonic medium.

Earth. We assess how sensitive the cosmic ray spectrum is to changes in the
sunspot placement and magnetic field strength, the large scale dipole magnetic
field strength, the wind ram pressure, and the Sun's rotation period. Overall,
our results confirm earlier work that suggested the Archean Earth would have
experienced a greatly reduced cosmic ray flux than is the case today. The
cosmic ray reduction for the early Sun is mainly due to the shorter solar
rotation period and tighter winding of the Parker spiral, and to the different
surface distribution of the more active solar magnetic field. These effects
lead to a global reduction of the cosmic ray flux at 1AU by up to two orders of
magnitude or more. Variations in the sunspot magnetic field have more effect on
the flux than variations in the dipole field component. The wind ram pressure
affects the cosmic ray flux through its influence on the size of the
heliosphere via the pressure balance with the ambient interstellar medium.
Variations in the interstellar medium pressure experienced by the solar system
in orbit through Galaxy could lead to order of magnitude changes in the cosmic
ray flux at Earth on timescales of a few million years.

is one of a particular class of hybrid vehicles, namely, range extender

electric vehicle that has an additional module -- the range extender (RE) -- as
an extra energy source in addition to its main energy source -- a high voltage

consecutive switches to be separated by a positive time interval. The approach
consists in the introduction of an adequate optimal control problem with lag

characterized by a dynamic programming algorithm. This algorithm is implemented

projected radial number density of the satellites obeys a power law form with
the best-fit logarithmic slope of -1.05, independent of both the central galaxy
luminosity and the satellite luminosity. The projected cross correlation
function between central and satellite galaxies exhibits a non-monotonic trend
with satellite luminosity. It is most pronounced for central galaxies with
M_r=-21, where the decreasing trend of clustering amplitude with satellite
luminosity is reversed when satellites are fainter than central galaxies by
more than 2 magnitudes. A comparison with the satellite luminosity functions in

could impact their mass-loss properties. For this, we employ Monte Carlo
simulations to establish the local line-force and solve for the momentum
equation of the stellar outflow, testing whether an outflow can actually be
established by assessing the net acceleration at the sonic point of the flow.
Stellar evolution models of rotating metal-poor stars are used to specify the
surface chemical composition, focussing on the phases of early enrichment. We
find that the mass-loss rates of CNO enhanced metal-poor stars are higher than
those of non-enriched stars, but they are much lower than those rates where the
CNO abundance is included in the total abundance Z. We present a heuristic
formula that provides mass-loss estimates for CNO-dominated winds in relation
to scaled-down solar abundances.

Fermi gas with tunable s-wave interaction between the two spin species. By
analyzing the two-body bound state, we find that the population of the excited
states in the tightly-confined axial direction can be significant when the
two-body binding energy becomes comparable or exceeds the axial confinement.
Since the Rashba spin-orbit coupling that we study here tends to enhance the
two-body binding energy, this effect can become prominent at unitarity or even
on the BCS side of the Feshbach resonance. To study the impact of these excited
modes along the third dimension, we adopt an effective two-dimensional
Hamiltonian in the form of a two-channel model, where the dressed molecules in
the closed channel consist of the conventional Feshbach molecules as well as
the excited states occupation in the axial direction. With properly
renormalized interactions between atoms and dressed molecules, we find that
both the density distribution and the phase structure in the trap can be
significantly modified near a wide Feshbach resonance. In particular, the
stability region of the topological superfluid phase is increased. Our findings
are helpful for the experimental search for the topological superfluid phase in
ultra-cold Fermi gases, and have interesting implications for
quasi-low-dimensional polarized Fermi gases in general.

scaling in the local Universe from data of 53 clusters with individual
measurements of mass. We found a 0.46+-0.12 slope and a 0.25+-0.03 dex scatter
measuring richness with a previously developed method. Second, we showed on a
real sample of 250 0.06<z<0.9 clusters, most of which are at z<0.3, with
spectroscopic redshift that the colour of the red sequence allows us to measure
the clusters' redshift to better than Delta z=0.02. Third, we computed the
predicted prior of the richness-mass scaling to forecast the capabilities of
future wide-field-area surveys of galaxy clusters to constrain cosmological
parameters. We computed the uncertainty and the covariance matrix of the
(evolving) richness-mass scaling of a PanStarrs 1+Euclid-like survey accounting
for a large suite of sources of errors. We find that the richness-mass scaling
parameters, which are the input ingredients of cosmological forecasts using
cluster counts, can be determined 10^5 times better than estimated in previous
works that did not use weak-lensing mass estimates. The better knowledge of the
scaling parameters likely has a strong impact on the relative importance of the
different probes used to constrain cosmological parameters. Richness-mass
scaling parameters were recovered, but only if the cluster mass function and
the weak-lensing redshift-dependent selection function were accounted for in
the fitting of the mass-richness scaling. This emphasizes the limitations of
often adopted simplifying assumptions, such as having a mass-complete
redshift-independent sample. The fitting code used for computing the predicted

in early 2008, many iron-based superconductors with different structures have
been discovered, with the highest transition temperature to date being 57 K. By
the end of 2010, another kind of new superconductor, the Fe-based chalcogenide
K1-xFe2-ySe2 was discovered. A naive counting of the electrons in the system
would lead to a conclusion that the system is heavily electron overdoped (~0.4
e/Fe). Band structure calculations further support this speculation and predict
that the hole pockets which are found in the iron pnictides may be missing.
This greatly challenges the widely perceived picture that the superconducting
pairing is established by exchanging anti-ferromagnetic spin fluctuations and
the electrons are scattered between the electron and hole pockets. Later, it
was found that both potassium and iron might be deficient in K1-xFe2-ySe2,
yielding to a picture of phase separation. In this picture the superconducting
phase and the antiferromagnetic (AF) phase may phase separate spatially into
different regions. This generates further curiosity about what is the real
superconducting phase, what is the relationship between the superconducting
phase and the AF phase, and what is the parent state for the superconducting
phase. We propose a ""spider web"" model for the phase separation, which can
explain both the transport and magnetic data. In this paper, we review the
status of research in this rapidly growing field and list the important and
unsettled issues as perspectives for future research.

One may call this the extreme nonlinear Mie-optics regime. We find that -
despite the fact that the plasma created at the droplet surface is overdense -
oscillating electric fields may penetrate into the droplet under a certain
angle, ionize, and propagate in the just generated plasma. This effect can be
attributed to the local field enhancements at the droplet surface predicted by
standard Mie theory. The penetration of the fields into the droplet leads to
the formation of a highly inhomogeneous charge density distribution in the
droplet interior, concentrated mostly in the polarization plane. We present a
self-similar, exponential fit of the fractional ionization degree which depends
only on a dimensionless combination of electric field amplitude, droplet
radius, and plasma frequency with only a weak dependence on the laser frequency

liquids made recently some progress thanks to the introduction of amorphous
boundary conditions, in which a set of free particles is subject to the effect
of a different set of particles frozen into their (low temperature) equilibrium
positions. In this way, one can study the crossover from nonergodic to ergodic
phase, as the size of the free region grows and the effect of the confinement
fades. Such crossover defines the so-called point-to-set correlation length,
which has been measured in a spherical geometry, or cavity. Here, we make
further progress in the study ofcorrelations under amorphous boundary
conditions by analyzing the equilibrium properties of a glass-forming liquid,
confined in a planar (""sandwich"") geometry. The mobile particles are subject to
amorphous boundary conditions with the particles in the surrounding walls
frozen into their low temperature equilibrium configurations. Compared to the
cavity, the sandwich geometry has three main advantages: i) the width of the
sandwich is decoupled from its longitudinal size, making the thermodynamic
limit possible; ii) for very large width, the behaviour off a single wall can
be studied; iii) we can use ""anti-parallel"" boundary conditions to force a
domain wall and measure its excess energy. Our results confirm that amorphous
boundary conditions are indeed a very useful new tool inthe study of static
properties of glass-forming liquids, but also raise some warning about the fact
that not all correlation functions that can be calculated in this framework

temperature and deformation effects are included in a phenomenological way to
account for a complete description of the nuclear dynamical problem. It is
shown that the resulting E1-strength function based on the PCF1 force is in
close agreement with photoabsorption data as well as the available experimental
E1 strength data at low energies. For neutron-rich nuclei, as well as light
neutron-deficient nuclei, a low-lying so-called pygmy resonance is found
systematically in the 5-10 MeV region. The corresponding strength can reach 10%
of the giant dipole strength in the neutron-rich region and about 5% in the
neutron-deficient region, and is found to be reduced in the vicinity of the
shell closures. Finally, the neutron capture reaction rates of neutron-rich
nuclei is found to be about 2-5 times larger than those predicted on the basis
of the nonrelativistic RPA calculation and about a factor 50 larger than
obtained with traditional Lorentzian-type approaches.

comprehensive critical discussion concerning foundational issues of
Electrodynamics. Attention is especially focused on the events which, about the
end of XIX century, led to the notion of Lorentz force, still today ubiquitous
in literature on Electrodynamics. Is this a noteworthy instance of a rule
which, generated by an improper simplification of Maxwell-JJ Thomson
formulation, is in fact physically untenable but, this notwithstanding, highly
successful. Modelling of electromagnetic fields and fluxes in spacetime
respectively as even and odd spatial differential forms and the formulation of
induction laws by means of exterior and Lie derivatives, make their covariance
manifest under any smooth spacetime transformations, contrary to the usual
affirmation in literature which confines this property to relativistic
frame-changes. A remarkable consequence is that there is no entanglement
between electric and magnetic fields and fluxes under special relativity
transformations. In particular, relativistic support to Lorentz force rule is
thus deactivated. For translational motions of charged bodies immersed in a
uniform and constant magnetic field, the induced electric field in such a
frame, is equal to one half the Lorentz force term. The qualitative successful
application of the Lorentz force rule to experimental evidence of special
observers is therefore explained.

extraordinary process when both microscopic and macroscopic properties of the
system undergo fundamental changes. Bose-Einstein condensation, has been
observed in a number of physical systems, including super-cold atomic gases and
solid- state quasiparticles. The most typical example of equilibrium
condensation is the superconducting state of Cooper pairs in metals. However,
in many cases the lifetime of particles or quasiparticles under study is
finite, ranging from picoseconds to milliseconds. And even in this case
condensation is possible. It is generally understood at present that coherence
and off-diagonal long-range order in the density matrix are the most important
characteristic features of condensed quantum states. Phase coherence
established over microscopic distances is an intrinsic property of all Bose
condensates. Experiments featuring interference between either two condensates
or two separate parts of the same condensate are often considered as more
convincing than observation of the macroscopic occupation of the ground state.
The formation of long-range order and spatial phase coherence can be measured

source for a dedicated bio-imaging beamline at the European XFEL. The goal of
the optimized scheme proposed here is to enable experimental simplification and
performance improvement. The core of the scheme is composed by soft and hard
X-ray self-seeding setups. Based on the use of an improved design for both
monochromators it is possible to increase the design electron energy up to 17.5
GeV in photon energy range between 2 keV and 13 keV, which is the most
preferable for life science experiments. An advantage of operating at such high
electron energy is the increase of the X-ray output peak power. Another
advantage is that 17.5 GeV is the preferred operation energy for SASE1 and
SASE2 beamline users. Since it will be necessary to run all the XFEL lines at
the same electron energy, this choice will reduce the interference with other
undulator lines and increase the total amount of scheduled beam time. In this
work we also propose a study of the performance of the self-seeding scheme
accounting for spatiotemporal coupling caused by the use of a single crystal
monochromator. Our analysis indicates that this distortion is easily suppressed
by the right choice of diamond crystal planes and that the proposed undulator
source yields about the same performance as in the case for a X-ray seed pulse
with no coupling. Simulations show that the FEL power reaches 2 TW in the 3 keV

systematic errors. We explicitly simulate near detectors for all experiments,
we use the same implementation of systematic uncertainties for all experiments,
and we fully correlate the uncertainties among detectors, oscillation channels,
and beam polarizations as appropriate. As our primary performance indicator, we
use the achievable precision in the measurement of the CP violating phase
$\deltacp$. We find that a neutrino factory is the only instrument that can
measure $\deltacp$ with a precision similar to that of its quark sector
counterpart. All neutrino beams operating at peak energies $\gtrsim 2$ GeV are
quite robust with respect to systematic uncertainties, whereas especially
\bbeams and \thk suffer from large cross section uncertainties in the
quasi-elastic regime, combined with their inability to measure the appearance
signal cross sections at the near detector. A noteworthy exception is the
combination of a $\gamma=100$ \bbeam with an \spl-based superbeam, in which all
relevant cross sections can be measured in a self-consistent way. This provides
a performance, second only to the neutrino factory. For other superbeam
experiments such as \lbno and the setups studied in the context of the \lbne
reconfiguration effort, statistics turns out to be the bottleneck. In almost
all cases, the near detector is not critical to control systematics since the
combined fit of appearance and disappearance data already constrains the impact
of systematics to be small provided that the three active flavor oscillation
framework is valid.

a geographical region. We discuss how to include wind directional information
in the covariance function of spatial models. We follow the spatial convolution
approach initially proposed by Higdon and co-authors, wherein a spatial process
is described by a convolution between a smoothing kernel and a white noise
process. We propose two different ways of accounting for wind direction in the
kernel function. For comparison purposes, we also consider a more flexible
kernel parametrization, that makes use of latent processes which vary smoothly
across the region. Inference procedure follows the Bayesian paradigm, and
uncertainty about parameter estimation is naturally accounted for when
performing spatial interpolation. We analyze ozone levels observed at a
monitoring network in the Northeast of the USA. Sam- ples from the posterior
distribution under our proposed models are obtained much faster when compared
to the kernel based on latent processes. Our models provide better results, in
terms of model fitting and spatial interpolation, when compared to simple
isotropic and geometrical anisotropic models. Despite the small number of
parameters, our proposed models provide fits which are comparable to those
obtained under the kernel based on latent processes.

applications, a bidirectional link is studied in which two nodes, Node 1 and
Node 2, communicate to fulfill generally conflicting informational
requirements. Node 2 is able to acquire information from the environment, e.g.,
via access to a remote data base or via sensing. Information acquisition is
expensive in terms of system resources, e.g., time, bandwidth and energy and
thus should be done efficiently by adapting the acquisition process to the
needs of the application. As a result of the forward communication from Node 1
to Node 2, the latter wishes to compute some function, such as a suitable
average, of the data available at Node 1 and of the data obtained from the
environment. The forward link is also used by Node 1 to query Node 2 with the
aim of retrieving suitable information from the environment on the backward
link. The problem is formulated in the context of multi-terminal
rate-distortion theory and the optimal trade-off between communication rates,
distortions of the information produced at the two nodes and costs for
information acquisition at Node 2 is derived. The issue of robustness to
possible malfunctioning of the data acquisition process at Node 2 is also
investigated. The results are illustrated via an example that demonstrates the
different roles played by the forward communication, namely data exchange,
query and control.

1885, producing thousands of visual meteors per hour and described as `stars
fell like rain' in Chinese records of the time. The shower originates from
comet 3D/Biela whose disintegration in the mid-1800's is linked to the
outbursts, but the shower has been weak or absent since the late 19th Century.
  This shower returned in December 2011 with a zenithal hourly rate of
approximately 50, the strongest return in over a hundred years. Some 122
probable Andromedid orbits were detected by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar.
  The shower outburst occurred during 2011 Dec 3-5. The radiant at RA
+$18\degree$ and Dec +$56\degree$ is typical of the `classical' Andromedids of
the early 1800's, whose radiant was actually in Cassiopeia. The orbital
elements indicate that the material involved was released before 3D/Biela's
breakup prior to 1846. The observed shower in 2011 had a slow geocentric speed
(16 km s$^{-1}$) and was comprised of small particles: the mean measured mass
from the radar is $\sim5 \times 10^{-7}$ kg corresponding to radii of 0.5 mm at
a bulk density of 1000 kg/m$^3$.
  Numerical simulations of the parent comet indicate that the meteoroids of the
2011 return of the Andromedids shower were primarily ejected during 3D/Biela's
1649 perihelion passage. The orbital characteristics, radiant, timing as well
as the absence of large particles in the streamlet are all consistent with
simulations. Predictions are made regarding other appearances of the shower in
the years 2000-2047 based on our numerical model. We note that the details of
the 2011 return can, in principle, be used to better constrain the orbit of
3D/Biela prior to the comets first recorded return in 1772.

malware. At the same time, each new generation of smartphone features
increasingly powerful onboard sensor suites. A new strain of sensor malware has
been developing that leverages these sensors to steal information from the
physical environment (e.g., researchers have recently demonstrated how malware
can listen for spoken credit card numbers through the microphone, or feel
keystroke vibrations using the accelerometer). Yet the possibilities of what
malware can see through a camera have been understudied. This paper introduces
a novel visual malware called PlaceRaider, which allows remote attackers to
engage in remote reconnaissance and what we call virtual theft. Through
completely opportunistic use of the camera on the phone and other sensors,
PlaceRaider constructs rich, three dimensional models of indoor environments.
Remote burglars can thus download the physical space, study the environment
carefully, and steal virtual objects from the environment (such as financial
documents, information on computer monitors, and personally identifiable
information). Through two human subject studies we demonstrate the
effectiveness of using mobile devices as powerful surveillance and virtual
theft platforms, and we suggest several possible defenses against visual
malware.

critical quantum magnetic fluctuations can change the Fermi surface topology
and also lead to spin charge separation (SCS) in two dimensions. We demonstrate
that in the physically interesting regime there is a magnetically driven
Lifshitz point (LP) inside the magnetically disordered phase. At the LP the
topology of the hole Fermi surface is changed. The position of the LP, while
being close to the position of the QCP is generally different. Dependent on the
additional hole hopping integrals $t^{\prime}$ and $t^{\prime\prime}$, the LP
can be located either in the magnetically ordered phase and/or in the
magnetically disordered phase. We also demonstrate that in this regime the hole
spin and charge necessarily separate when approaching the QCP. The considered
model sheds light on generic problems concerning the physics of the cuprates.

observations, we made dynamical simulations of the Taffy system including a
sticky particle component. To compare simulation snapshots to HI and CO
observations, we assume that the molecular fraction of the gas depends on the
square root of the gas volume density. For the comparison of our simulations
with observations of polarized radio continuum emission, we calculated the
evolution of the 3D large-scale magnetic field for our simulations. The
induction equations including the time-dependent gas-velocity fields from the
dynamical model were solved for this purpose. Our simulations reproduce the
stellar distribution of the primary galaxy, UGC 12914, the prominent HI and CO
gas bridge, the offset between the CO and HI emission in the bridge, the bridge
isovelocity vectors parallel to the bridge, the HI double-line profiles in the
bridge region, the large line-widths (~200 km/s) in the bridge region, the high
field strength of the bridge large-scale regular magnetic field, the projected
magnetic field vectors parallel to the bridge and the strong total power radio
continuum emission from the bridge. The stellar distribution of the secondary
model galaxy is more perturbed than observed. The observed distortion of the HI
envelope of the Taffy system is not reproduced by our simulations which use
initially symmetric gas disks. The model allows us to define the bridge region
in three dimensions. We estimate the total bridge gas mass (HI, warm and cold
H2) to be 5 to 6 10^9 M_sun, with a molecular fraction M_H2/M_HI of about unity
