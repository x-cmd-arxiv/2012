the modeling of quiescent solar prominences. We compare space observations of
Lyman lines with ground-based observations of Balmer lines for quiescent solar
prominences of comparable brightness defined by their H-beta emission. The
effective number densities of hydrogen atoms emitting from the same upper level
u deduced from the corresponding emerging Lyman and Balmer line emissions show
large differences that diminish with increasing level number and converge at
the highest level numbers. Hydrogen atoms excited in u=5 contribute 250 times
less, and those in u=8 still contribute 65 times less to the Lyman than to the
corresponding Balmer emission, supporting the idea of distinct spatial origin
of the emissions of both series. This is also indicated by the line widths. The
high optical thickness of all Lyman members allows the brightness temperature
T_b to be estimated from the spectral radiance at line center, where T_b is
found to be largely independent of the upper level number, in contrast to the
(known) behavior of the Balmer lines.

In particular, two variants of OMP either with known sparsity level or with a
stopping rule are analyzed. It is shown that if the measurement matrix
$X\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times p}$ satisfies the strong coherence property, then with
$n\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(k\log p)$, OMP will recover a $k$-sparse signal with high

the properties required of the measurement matrix from the properties required
of the signal, which depends critically on the minimum signal to noise ratio

of six-point one-particle reducible interactions, which are usually neglected
by the dual fermion approach. We show that the consideration of one-particle
reducible six-point (as well as higher order) vertices is crucially important
for the diagrammatic consistency of this approach. In particular, the relation
between the dual and lattice self-energy, derived in the dual fermion approach,
implicitly accounts for the effect of the diagrams, containing 6-point and
higher order local one-particle reducible vertices, and should be applied with
caution, if these vertices are neglected. Apart from that, the treatment of the
self-energy feedback is also modified by 6-point and higher order vertices;
these vertices are also important to account for some non-local corrections to
the lattice self-energy, which have the same order in the local 4-point
vertices, as the diagrams usually considered in the approach. These
observations enlighten an importance of 6-point and higher order vertices in
the dual fermion approach, and call for development of new schemes of treatment
of non-local fluctuations, which are based on one-particle irreducible
quantities.

the information that can be extracted from individual detections, such as the
mass of a binary system and its location in space. Here we consider how the
information from multiple detections can be used to constrain astrophysical
population models. This seemingly simple problem is made challenging by the
high dimensionality and high degree of correlation in the parameter spaces that
describe the signals, and by the complexity of the astrophysical models, which
can also depend on a large number of parameters, some of which might not be
directly constrained by the observations. We present a method for constraining
population models using a Hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach which
simultaneously infers the source parameters and population model and provides
the joint probability distributions for both. We illustrate this approach by
considering the constraints that can be placed on population models for
galactic white dwarf binaries using a future space based gravitational wave
detector. We find that a mission that is able to resolve ~5000 of the shortest
period binaries will be able to constrain the population model parameters,

cosmic-ray-generated UV photons in chemical models of the midplane of
protoplanetary disks, focusing on its implications on ice formation and
chemical evolution. Aims. Our goal is to improve on chemical models by treating
cosmic rays, the main source of ionization in the midplane of the disk, in a
way that is consistent with current knowledge of the gas and grain environment
present in those regions. We trace the effects of cosmic rays by identifying
the main chemical reaction channels and also the main contributors to the gas
opacity to cosmic-ray-induced UV photons. This information is crucial in
implementing gas opacities for cosmic-ray-induced reactions in full 2D
protoplanetary disk models. Methods. We considered time-dependent chemical
models within the range 1-10 AU in the midplane of a T Tauri disk. The
extinction of cosmic-ray-induced UV photons by gaseous species was included in
the calculation of photorates at each timestep. We integrated the ionization
and dissociation cross sections of all atoms/molecules over the
cosmic-ray-induced UV emission spectrum of H_2. By analyzing the relative
contribution of each gas phase species over time, we were able to identify the
main contributors to the gas opacity in the midplane of protoplanetary disks.
Results. At 1 AU the gas opacity contributes up to 28.2% of the total opacity,
including the dust contribution. At 3-5 AU the gas contribution is 14.5% of the
total opacity, and at 7-8 AU it reaches a value of 12.2%. As expected, at 10-15
AU freeze-out of species causes the gas contribution to the total opacity to be
very low (6%). The main contributors to the gas opacity are CO, CO_2, S, SiO,
and O_2. OH also contributes to the gas opacity, but only at 10-15 AU.

said to be extensible to height t. Smith (1994, 2007) showed that an
association scheme X=(Q,\Gamma) of order d:=|Q| is Schurian iff X is extensible
to height (d-2). In this work, we formalize the maximal height t_max(X) of an
association scheme X as the largest positive integer such that X is extensible
to height t (we also include the possibility t_max(X)=\infty, which is
equivalent to t_max(X)\ge (d-2)). Intuitively, the maximal height provides a
natural measure of how close an association scheme is to being Schurian.
  For the purpose of computing the maximal height, we introduce the association
scheme extension algorithm. On input an association scheme X=(Q,\Gamma) of
order d:=|Q| and an integer t such that 1\le t\le (d-2), the association scheme
extension algorithm decides in time d^(O(t)) if the scheme X is extensible to
height t. In particular, if t is a fixed constant, then the running time of the
association scheme extension algorithm is polynomial in the order of X.
  The association scheme extension algorithm is used to show that all
non-Schurian association schemes up to order 26 are completely inextensible,
i.e. they are not extensible to a positive height. Via the tensor product of
association schemes, the latter result gives rise to a multitude of examples of
infinite families of completely inextensible association schemes.

a higher-order variational problem subject to higher-order constraints (that
is, when the Lagrangian function and the constraints depend on higher-order
derivatives such as the acceleration, jerk or jounces). In this paper we
discuss the variational formalism for the class of underactuated mechanical
control systems when the configuration space is a trivial principal bundle and
the construction of variational integrators for such mechanical control
systems.
  An interesting family of geometric integrators can be defined using
discretizations of the Hamilton's principle of critical action. This family of
geometric integrators is called variational integrators, being one of their
main properties the preservation of geometric features as the symplecticity,
momentum preservation and good behavior of the energy. We construct variational
integrators for higher-order mechanical systems on trivial principal bundles
and their extension for higher-order constrained systems and we devote special
attention to the particular case of underactuated mechanical systems

mechanisms to achieve high sensitivity and frequency selectivity. Recent
experimental studies have documented self-sustained oscillations in hair cells

spontaneous mechanical oscillations. Second, somatic electric voltage
oscillations across the baso-lateral membrane of the hair cell have been
observed. We develop a biophysical model of the bullfrog's saccular hair cell
consisting of two compartments, mechanical and electrical, to study how the
mechanical and the voltage oscillations interact to produce coherent
self-sustained oscillations and how this interaction contributes to the overall
sensitivity and selectivity of the hair cell. The model incorporates nonlinear
mechanical stochastic hair bundle system coupled bi-directionally to a
Hodgkin-Huxley type system describing somatic ionic currents. We isolate
regions of coherent spontaneous oscillations in the parameter space of the
model and then study how coupling between compartments affect sensitivity of
the hair cell to external mechanical perturbations. We show that spontaneous
electrical oscillations may enhance significantly the sensitivity and
selectivity of the hair cell.

core-collapse explosions. One such case was SN 2009ip, which was recognized to
be a luminous blue variable (LBV) eruption. This source had a massive hot
progenitor star identified in pre-explosion data, it had documented evidence of
pre-outburst variability, and it was subsequently discovered to have a 2nd
outburst in 2010. This same source rebrightened again in 2012, and early
spectra showed the same narrow-line profiles as before, suggesting another
LBV-like eruption. We present new photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2009ip,
indicating that it has transitioned into a true SN. The most striking discovery
in these data is that unlike previous reports, the spectrum exhibited Balmer
lines with very broad P-Cygni profiles characteristic of normal Type II
supernovae (SNe II), in addition to narrow emission lines seen in SNe IIn and
LBVs. Emission components have FWHM 8000 km/s, while the P-Cygni absorption
component has blue wings extending to -13,000 km/s. These velocities are
typical of SNe II, but have never been associated with emission lines from a
nonterminal LBV-like eruption. Initially, the peak absolute magnitude seemed
fainter than that of normal SNe. However, after a brief period of fading, the
source quickly brightened again to M_R=-17.5 mag over a couple days. The broad
lines mostly disappeared, and the spectrum began to resemble the early
optically thick phases of SNe IIn. Two weeks later the source leveled off near
-18 mag, after which broad emission lines again developed in the spectrum as
the source faded. We conclude that the 2012 outburst of SN 2009ip was the
result of a true core-collapse SN IIn that occured when the progenitor star was
in an LBV-like outburst phase, and where the SN was initially faint and then
rapidly brightened due to interaction with circumstellar material (abridged).

binary system HD 47129 (Plaskett's star), in the context of the Magnetism in

acquired using the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope and the Narval spectropolarimeter at the T\'elescope Bernard Lyot.
Using Least-Squares Deconvolution we obtain definite detections of signal in
Stokes $V$ in 3 observations. No significant signal is detected in the
diagnostic null ($N$) spectra. The Zeeman signatures are broad and track the
radial velocity of the secondary component; we therefore conclude that the
rapidly-rotating secondary component is the magnetized star. Correcting the
polarized spectra for the line and continuum of the (sharp-lined) primary, we
measured the longitudinal magnetic field from each observation. The
longitudinal field of the secondary is variable and exhibits extreme values of
$-810\pm 150$ G and $+680\pm 190$ G, implying a minimum surface dipole polar
strength of $2850\pm 500$ G. In contrast, we derive an upper limit ($3\sigma$)
to the primary's surface magnetic field of 230 G. The combination of a strong
magnetic field and rapid rotation leads us to conclude that the secondary hosts
a centrifugal magnetosphere fed through a magnetically confined wind. We
revisit the properties of the optical line profiles and X-ray emission -
previously interpreted as a consequence of colliding stellar winds - in this
context. We conclude that HD 47129 represents a heretofore unique stellar
system - a close, massive binary with a rapidly rotating, magnetized component

of galaxies is still unclear. One possibility is that primordial magnetic
fields generated in the early Universe provide seeds that grow through
compression and turbulence during structure formation. A cosmological magnetic
field present prior to recombination would produce substantial matter
clustering at intermediate/small scales, on top of the standard inflationary
power spectrum. In this work we study the effect of this alteration on one
particular cosmological observable, cosmic shear. We adopt the semi-analytic
halo model in order to describe the non-linear clustering of matter, and feed
it with the altered mass variance induced by primordial magnetic fields. We
find that the convergence power spectrum is, as expected, substantially
enhanced at intermediate/small angular scales, with the exact amplitude of the
enhancement depending on the magnitude and power-law index of the magnetic
field power spectrum. We use the predicted statistical errors for a future
wide-field cosmic shear survey, on the model of the ESA Cosmic Vision mission
\emph{Euclid}, in order to forecast constraints on the amplitude of primordial
magnetic fields as a function of the spectral index. We find that the amplitude
will be constrained at the level of $\sim 0.1$ nG for $n_B\sim -3$, and at the
level of $\sim 10^{-7}$ nG for $n_B\sim 3$. The latter is at the same level of
lower bounds coming from the secondary emission of gamma-ray sources, implying
that for high spectral indices \emph{Euclid} will certainly be able to detect
primordial magnetic fields, if they exist. The present study shows how
large-scale structure surveys can be used for both understanding the origins of
astrophysical magnetic fields and shedding new light on the physics of the

there exists a difference in the irreversible entropy production between the
original and reduced dynamics. We call this difference the hidden entropy
production, since it is an invisible quantity when only the reduced system's
view is provided. We show that this hidden entropy production obeys a new
integral fluctuation theorem for the generic case where all variables are
time-reversal invariant, therefore supporting the intuition that entropy
production should decrease by coarse graining. It is found, however, that in
cases where the condition for our theorem does not hold, entropy production may
also increase due to the reduction. The extended multibaker map is investigated
as an example for this case.

potential differences that are related to the flow direction and volumetric
fluxes, as well as to the soil properties themselves. Laboratory and field data
suggest that these so-called streaming potentials may be several orders of
magnitudes larger than theoretical predictions that only consider the influence
of the relative permeability and electrical conductivity on the self potential
(SP) data. Recent work has partly improved predictions by considering how the
volumetric excess charge in the pore space scales with the inverse of water
saturation. We present a new theoretical approach that uses the flux-averaged
excess charge, not the volumetric excess charge, to predict streaming
potentials. We present relationships for how this effective excess charge
varies with water saturation for typical soil properties using either the water
retention or the relative permeability function. We find large differences
between soil types and the predictions based on the relative permeability
function display the best agreement with field data. The new relationships
better explain laboratory data than previous work and allow us to predict the
recorded magnitudes of the streaming potentials following a rainfall event in
sandy loam, whereas previous models predict three orders of magnitude too small
values. We suggest that the strong signals in unsaturated media can be used to
gain information about fluxes (including very small ones related to film flow),
but also to constrain the relative permeability function, the water retention
curve, and the relative electrical conductivity function.

separate informative terms from non-informative terms. This refinement is very
close to CIC, but with the property that typing judgments can distinguish
informative terms. Among many applications, this natural encoding of
parametricity inside CIC serves both theoretical purposes (proving the
independence of propositions with respect to the logical system) as well as
practical aspirations (proving properties of finite algebraic structures). We

paragraph of this abstract.
  By generalizing Tasaki's work on the second law of thermodynamics for an
adiabatic process between two equilibrium states of a macroscopic quantum
compound system, we obtain an extension of the second law to a transient
adiabatic process that takes a macroscopic quantum compound system consisting
of a system of interest and two heat reservoirs from an initial equilibrium
state to a final non-equilibrium state, where the system of interest is in a
steady heat conduction state. For the system of interest, we define its
generalized entropy so that it becomes an experimentally measurable quantity
and exactly satisfies an extension of the Clausius relation.
  This paper has been withdrawn by the author because the generalized entropy
presented in this article violates the second law when the system in a steady
heat conduction state is detached from the two reservoirs and then attached to
a reservoir at the temperature T^bar defined in Sec.1.2 so that it will reach
an equilibrium state at T^bar. In this irreversible process, the total entropy
for the system and the reservoir remains constant and thus violates the second
law.

High Energy Transmission Gratings Spectrometer (HETGS) instrument on the
Chandra X-ray Observatory. These observations will allow us to measure the
quiescent X-ray spectra of Sgr A* for the first time at both high spatial and
spectral resolution. The X-ray emission of Sgr A*, however, is known to flare
roughly daily by factors of a few to ten times over quiescent emission levels,
with rarer flares extending to factors of greater than 100 times quiescence.
Here were report an observation performed on 2012 February 9 wherein we
detected what is the highest peak flux and fluence flare ever observed from Sgr
A*. The flare, which lasted for 5.6 ks and had a decidedly asymmetric profile
with a faster decline than rise, achieved a mean absorbed 2-8 keV flux of
(8.5+/-0.9)X10^{-12} erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}. The peak flux was 2.5 times higher,
and the total 2-10 keV emission of the event was approximately 10^{39} erg.
Only one other flare of comparable magnitude, but shorter duration, has been
observed in Sgr A* by XMM-Newton in 2002 October. We perform spectral fits of
this Chandra observed flare, and compare our results to the two brightest
flares ever observed with XMM-Newton. We find good agreement among the fitted
spectral slopes (Gamma~2) and X-ray absorbing columns (N_H~15X10^{22} cm^{-2})
for all three of these events, resolving prior differences (which are most
likely due to the combined effects of pileup and spectral modeling) among
Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of Sgr A* flares. We also discuss fits to
the quiescent spectra of Sgr A*.

transforming according to the two-index antisymmetric representation for three

complex plane and the location of their zeros in a scaling limit where $n$
grows to infinity with $N$.
  The asymptotics are described in terms of three (probability) measures
associated with the problem. The first measure is the limit of the counting
measure of zeros of the polynomials, which is captured by the $g$-function much
in the spirit of ordinary orthogonal polynomials on the real line. The second
measure is the equilibrium measure that minimizes a certain logarithmic
potential energy, supported on a region $K$ of the complex plane. The third
measure is the harmonic measure of $K^c$ with a pole at $\infty$. This appears
as the limit of the probability measure given (up to the normalization
constant) by the squared modulus of the $n$-th orthogonal polynomial times the
orthogonality measure, i.e. $|P_n(z)|^2 |z-a|^{2N c} {\rm e}^{-N |z|^2} \,{\rm

  The compact region $K$ that is the support of the second measure undergoes a

has been at its center. In response to the crisis, drastic actions have been
taken, including the halving of Greek debt. Policy makers acted because
interest rates for sovereign debt increased dramatically. High interest rates
imply that default is likely due to economic conditions. High interest rates
also increase the cost of borrowing and thus cause default to be likely. If
there is a departure from equilibrium, increasing interest rates may contribute
to---rather than be caused by---default risk. Here we build a quantitative
equilibrium model of sovereign default risk that, for the first time, is able
to determine if markets are consistently set by economic conditions. We show
that over the period 2001-2012, the annually-averaged long-term interest rates
of Greek debt are quantitatively related to the ratio of debt to GDP. The
relationship shows that the market consistently expects default to occur if the
Greek debt reaches twice the GDP. Our analysis does not preclude
non-equilibrium increases in interest rates over shorter timeframes. We find
evidence of such non-equilibrium fluctuations in a separate analysis. According
to the equilibrium model, the date by which a half-default must occur is March
2013, almost one year after the actual debt write-down. Any acceleration of
default by non-equilibrium fluctuations is significant for national and
international interventions. The need for austerity or bailout costs would be
reduced if market regulations were implemented to increase market stability to
prevent short term interest rate increases. We similarly evaluate the timing of
projected defaults without interventions for Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy
to be March 2013, April 2014, May 2014, and July 2016, respectively. All
defaults are mitigated by planned interventions.

realizations of topological quantum computation. These heretofore undiscovered

insulators with bulk s-wave superconductivity in the presence of a
vortex-lattice generated by a perpendicular magnetic field. Using
self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes, calculations we confirm that beyond the
semi-classical, weak-pairing limit that the Majorana vortex states appear as
the chemical potential is tuned from either side of the band edge so long as
the density of states is sufficient for superconductivity to form. Further, we
demonstrate that the previously predicted vortex phase transition survives
beyond the semi-classical limit. At chemical potential values smaller than the
critical chemical potential, the vortex lattice modes hybridize within the top
and bottom surfaces giving rise to a dispersive low-energy mid-gap band. As the
chemical potential is increased, the Majorana states become more localized
within a single surface but spread into the bulk toward the opposite surface.
Eventually, when the chemical potential is sufficiently high in the bulk bands,
the Majorana modes can tunnel between surfaces and eventually a critical point
is reached at which modes on opposite surfaces can freely tunnel and annihilate
leading to the topological phase transition previously studied in the work of
Hosur et al.

high and fluctuating food prices have lead to widespread hunger and social
unrest. While a relative dip in food prices occurred during the spring of 2012,
a massive drought in the American Midwest in June and July threatens to trigger
another crisis. In a previous paper, we constructed a model that quantitatively
agreed with food prices and demonstrated that, while the behavior could not be
explained by supply and demand economics, it could be parsimoniously and
accurately described by a model which included both the conversion of corn into
ethanol and speculator trend following. An update to the original paper in
February 2012 demonstrated that the model previously published was predictive
of the ongoing price dynamics, and anticipated a new food crisis by the end of
2012 if adequate policy actions were not implemented. Here we provide a second
update, evaluating the effects of the current drought on global food prices. We
find that the drought may trigger the expected third food price bubble to occur
sooner, before new limits to speculation are scheduled to take effect. Reducing
the amount of corn that is being converted to ethanol may address the immediate
crisis. Over the longer term, market stabilization requires limiting financial

using four different magnetic field models and reconstruction techniques;
force-free fitting (Goldstein,1983,Burlaga,1988,Lepping et al.,1990),
magnetostatic reconstruction using a numerical solution to the Grad-Shafranov
equation (Hu and Sonnerup, 2001), fitting to a self-similarly expanding
cylindrical configuration (Marubashi and Lepping, 2007) and elliptical,
non-force free fitting (Hidalgo,2003). The resulting parameters of the
reconstructions for the 59 events are compared statistically, as well as in
selected case studies. The ability of a method to fit or reconstruct an event
is found to vary greatly: the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction is successful for
most magnetic clouds (MCs) but for less than 10% of the non-MC ICMEs; the other
three methods provide a successful fit for more than 65% of all events. The
differences between the reconstruction and fitting methods are discussed, and
suggestions are proposed as to how to reduce them. We find that the magnitude
of the axial field is relatively consistent across models but not the
orientation of the axis of the ejecta. We also find that there are a few cases
for which different signs of the magnetic helicity are found for the same event
when we do not fix the boundaries, illustrating that this simplest of
parameters is not necessarily always well constrained by fitting and
reconstruction models. Finally, we look at three unique cases in depth to

penetration depth $\lambda(T)$ using magnetic force microscopy. Our findings
indicate that a radiation dose of 2$\times10^{16}$cm$^{-2}$ produced by 3 MeV
protons results in a reduction of the superconducting critical temperature
$T_{c}$ by approximately 10%. % with no appreciable change in the slope of the
upper critical fields. In contrast, $\rho_{s}(0)$ is suppressed by
approximately 60%. This break-down of the Abrikosov-Gorkov theory may be
explained by the so-called ""Swiss cheese model"", which accounts for the spatial
suppression of the order parameter near point defects similar to holes in Swiss
cheese. Both the slope of the upper critical field and the penetration depth
$\lambda(T/T_{c})/\lambda(0)$ exhibit similar temperature dependences before
and after irradiation. This may be due to a combination of the highly
disordered nature of Ca$_{0.5}$Na$_{0.5}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ with large intraband and
simultaneous interband scattering as well as the $s^\pm$-wave nature of short
coherence length superconductivity.

estimates the CME mass-loss rate from the observed energies of PMS X-ray

energy and CME mass: log(M_CME [g]) = 0.63 x log(E_flare [erg]) - 2.57. Using
masses determined for the largest flaring magnetic structures observed on PMS

orders of magnitude in flare energy and 7 orders of magnitude in CME mass. The
total CME mass-loss rate we calculate for typical solar-type PMS stars is in
the range 1e-12 to 1e-9 M_sun/yr. We then use these CME mass-loss rate
estimates to infer the attendant angular momentum loss leading up to the main
sequence. Assuming the CME outflow rate for a typical ~1 M_sun T Tauri star is
< 1e-10 M_sun/yr, the resulting spin-down torque is too small during the first
~1 Myr to counteract the stellar spin-up due to contraction and accretion.
However, if the CME mass-loss rate is >1e-10 M_sun/yr, as permitted by our

(N-SDW) state, it is found that a nontrivial topological antiferromagnetic SDW
state (T-SDW) with a quantized Hall conductance is possible if the
quasiparticle gap is dominated by the next-nearest-neighbor hopping rather than
the antiferromagnetic order. By analyzing the low-energy effective Chern-Simon
action and the corresponding chiral edge state, the T-SDW could be considered
as a quantum anomalous Hall insulator with antiferromagnetic long-range order.
This state is apparently beyond Landau-Ginzburg paradigm, which can be
attributed to the interplay of quantum anomalous Hall effect and the subtle
antiferromagnetic order in the Kondo-lattice-like model. While the transition
between the SDW states and the Kondo insulator is found to be conventional (a
first order transition), the transition between the N- and T-SDWs is, however,
a topological quantum phase transition. Interestingly, such topological quantum
phase transition can be described by Dirac fermions coupled to a U
(1)Chern-Simon gauge field, which resembles the critical theory between bosonic
integer quantum Hall phases and superfluid phase and also indicates that such a

best estimate of the image scale and the known components of MDI's image
distortion. A multi-taper power spectrum estimator was used to generate power
spectra up to l = 1000, with a large number of tapers to reduce the realization
noise, while the blending at high degrees negates the need for high spectral
resolution. These power spectra were fitted for all degrees and all azimuthal
orders, between l = 100 and l = 1000. This fitting generated in excess of
6x10^6 individual estimates of ridge frequencies, line-widths, amplitudes and
asymmetries (singlets: l,n,m), corresponding to some 6,000 multiplets (l,n).
Fitting at high degrees generates ridge characteristics, characteristics that
do not correspond to the underlying mode characteristics. We used a
sophisticated forward modeling to recover the best possible estimate of the
underlying mode characteristics (mode frequencies, as well as line-widths,

layer in turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection in a cylindrical cell. The
measurements were made at Rayleigh numbers $Ra$ in the range
$2.8\times10^{8}<Ra<5.6\times10^{9}$ and were conducted with the convection
cell tilted with an angle $\theta$ relative to gravity, at $\theta=0.5^{o}$,
$1.0^{o}$, $2.0^{o}$, and $3.4^{o}$, respectively. The fluid was water with
Prandtl number $Pr=5.3$.
  It is found that at small tilt angles ($\theta \le 1^{o}$), the measured
viscous boundary layer thickness $\delta_{v}$ scales with the Reynolds number
$Re$ with an exponent close to that for a Prandtl-Blasius laminar boundary
layer, i.e. $\delta_{v} \sim Re^{-0.46\pm0.03}$. For larger tilt angles, the
scaling exponent of $\delta_{v}$ with $Re$ decreases with $\theta$. The
normalized mean horizontal velocity profiles measured at the same tilt angle
but with different $Ra$ are found to have an invariant shape. But for different
tilt angles, the shape of the normalized profiles is different.
  It is also found that the Reynolds number $Re$ based on the maximum mean
horizontal velocity scales with $Ra$ as $Re \sim Ra^{0.43}$ and the Reynolds
number $Re_{\sigma}$ based on the maximum rms velocity scales with $Ra$ as
$Re_{\sigma} \sim Ra^{0.55}$, with both exponents do not seem to depend on the
tilt angle $\theta$.
  We also examined the dynamical scaling method proposed bys Zhou and Xia

In apoptosis, tens

ODEs with the PEA (partial equilibrium approximation) method. In doing so, we
propose a general framework of the PEA method together with some conditions,
under which the PEA method can be justified rigorously. The main condition is
the principle of detailed balance for fast reactions as a whole. With the
justified method as a tool, we made many attempts via numerical tests to
simplify the Fas-signaling pathway model due to Hua et al. (2005) and found
that nine of reactions therein can be well regarded as relatively fast. This

selection by building only one ensemble. In RRF the features are evaluated on a
part of the training data at each tree node. We derive an upper bound for the
number of distinct Gini information gain values in a node, and show that many
features can share the same information gain at a node with a small number of
instances and a large number of features. Therefore, in a node with a small
number of instances, RRF is likely to select a feature not strongly relevant.
Here an enhanced RRF, referred to as the guided RRF (GRRF), is proposed. In
GRRF, the importance scores from an ordinary random forest (RF) are used to
guide the feature selection process in RRF. Experiments on 10 gene data sets
show that the accuracy performance of GRRF is, in general, more robust than RRF
when their parameters change. GRRF is computationally efficient, can select
compact feature subsets, and has competitive accuracy performance, compared to
RRF, varSelRF and LASSO logistic regression (with evaluations from an RF
classifier). Also, RF applied to the features selected by RRF with the minimal
regularization outperforms RF applied to all the features for most of the data
sets considered here. Therefore, if accuracy is considered more important than
the size of the feature subset, RRF with the minimal regularization may be
considered. We use the accuracy performance of RF, a strong classifier, to
evaluate feature selection methods, and illustrate that weak classifiers are
less capable of capturing the information contained in a feature subset. Both
RRF and GRRF were implemented in the ""RRF"" R package available at CRAN, the

the dual-chiral-density-wave (DCDW) specified by the spatially modulated quark
condensates. Since the DCDW state can be represented as a chirally rotated
state from the normal quark matter, the quark weak-current is accordingly
transformed to have an additional phase factor which modifies the
energy-momentum conservation at the vertex, and makes the quark direct Urca
process possible. The direct evaluation of the neutrino emissivity shows that
it is proportional to and the magnitude is comparable with the quark or pion
cooling. Since the DCDW phase develops only in the limited density region, this
novel mechanism may give an interesting scenario about cooling of hybrid stars
that lower-mass stars should be cooler than higher-mass ones.

The SiO v=1, J=1-0 and H2O 6(16)-5(23) maser lines are detected toward 2 of 4
known RSGs in Wd1. The large velocity ranges of maser emission are consistent
with the RSG status. RSGs with maser emission tend to exhibit redder log
(F21/F12) and [K-12.13] colors compared to RSGs with no maser emission. The
mass-loss rates derived from dust radiative transfer modeling suggest that RSGs
with maser emission tend to exhibit larger mass-loss rates compared to RSGs
with no maser emission. In an extended sample of 57 RSGs in 6 massive clusters,
detections in the SiO line tend to homogeneously distribute in absolute
luminosity L, whereas those in the H2O line tend to distribute in a region with

challenge 1 data sets. I tried many things, and more failed than succeeded, but
in the end I found two approaches that appear to work based on tests done using
the open data sets. One approach works directly with the time domain data, and
the other works with a specially constructed Fourier transform of the data. The
raw data was run through TEMPO2 to produce reduced timing residuals for the
analysis. Standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques were used to produce
samples from the posterior distribution function for the model parameters. The
model parameters include the gravitational wave amplitude and spectral slope,
and the white noise amplitude for each pulsar in the array. While red timing
noise was only included in Dataset 3, I found that it was necessary to include
effective red noise in all the analyses to account for some of the spurious
effects introduced by the TEMPO2 timing fit. This added an additional amplitude
and slope parameter for each pulsar, so my overall model for the 36 pulsars
residuals has 110 parameters. As an alternative to using an effective red noise
model, I also tried to simultaneously re-fit the timing model model while
looking for the gravitational wave signal, but for reasons that are not yet
clear, this approach was not very successful. I comment briefly on ways in
which the algorithms could be improved. My best estimates for the gravitational
wave amplitudes in the three closed (blind) data sets are: (1) $A=(7.3\pm
1.0)\times 10^{-15}$; (2) $A=(5.7\pm 0.6)\times 10^{-14}$; and (3) $A=(4.6\pm

multi-wavelength XMM/INTEGRAL campaign on the Seyfert 1 Mrk 509 are used in
this paper and tested against physically motivated broad band models. Each
observation has been fitted with a realistic thermal comptonisation model for
the continuum emission. Prompted by the correlation between the UV and soft
X-ray flux, we use a thermal comptonisation component for the soft X-ray
excess. The UV to X-rays/gamma-rays emission of Mrk 509 can be well fitted by
these components. The presence of a relatively hard high-energy spectrum points
to the existence of a hot (kT~100 keV), optically-thin (tau~0.5) corona
producing the primary continuum. On the contrary, the soft X-ray component
requires a warm (kT~1 keV), optically-thick (tau~15) plasma. Estimates of the
amplification ratio for this warm plasma support a configuration close to the
""theoretical"" configuration of a slab corona above a passive disk. An
interesting consequence is the weak luminosity-dependence of its emission, a
possible explanation of the roughly constant spectral shape of the soft X-ray
excess seen in AGNs. The temperature (~ 3 eV) and flux of the soft-photon field
entering and cooling the warm plasma suggests that it covers the accretion disk
down to a transition radius $R_{tr}$ of 10-20 $R_g$. This plasma could be the
warm upper layer of the accretion disk. On the contrary the hot corona has a
more photon-starved geometry. The high temperature ($\sim$ 100 eV) of the
soft-photon field entering and cooling it favors a localization of the hot
corona in the inner flow. This soft-photon field could be part of the
comptonised emission produced by the warm plasma. In this framework, the change
in the geometry (i.e. $R_{tr}$) could explain most of the observed flux and
spectral variability.

last two decades a general trend has appeared trying to exploit the power of
the word RAM model to speed-up the performances of classical string matching
algorithms. In this model an algorithm operates on words of length w, grouping
blocks of characters, and arithmetic and logic operations on the words take one
unit of time. In this paper we use specialized word-size packed string matching
instructions, based on the Intel streaming SIMD extensions (SSE) technology, to
design very fast string matching algorithms in the case of short patterns. From
our experimental results it turns out that, despite their quadratic worst case
time complexity, the new presented algorithms become the clear winners on the

model in a (3+1) dimensional Minkowski space-time are investigated. The
extension is obtained by adding to the Lagrangian a quartic term, which is the
square of the kinetic term, and a potential which breaks the SO(3) symmetry
down to SO(2). The construction of the solutions has been done in twofold: one
makes use of an axially symmetric ansatz and solves the resulting ODE by an
analytical and a numerical way. The analytical vortices are obtained for
special form of the potentials, and the numerical ones are computed using the
successive over relaxation method for wider choice of the potentials. Another
is based on a simulational technique named the simulated annealing method which

the number of times each base was observed at hundreds of thousands to billions
of genome positions in each sample. Using these counts to detect mutations is
challenging because mutations may have very low prevalence and sequencing error
rates vary dramatically by genome position. The discreteness of sequencing data
also creates a difficult multiple testing problem: current false discovery rate
methods are designed for continuous data, and work poorly, if at all, on
discrete data. We show that a simple randomization technique lets us use
continuous false discovery rate methods on discrete data. Our approach is a
useful way to estimate false discovery rates for any collection of discrete
test statistics, and is hence not limited to sequencing data. We then use an
empirical Bayes model to capture different sources of variation in sequencing
error rates. The resulting method outperforms existing detection approaches on
example data sets.

spectropolarimetric observations constitute a very powerful way of inferring
the dynamical, thermodynamical, and magnetic properties of distant objects.
However, these techniques are photon-starving, making it difficult to use them
for all purposes. One of the problems commonly found is just detecting the
presence of a signal that is buried on the noise at the wavelength of some
interesting spectral feature. This is specially relevant for
spectropolarimetric observations because typically, only a small fraction of
the received light is polarized. We present in this note a Bayesian technique
for the detection of spectropolarimetric signals. The technique is based on the
application of the non-parametric relevance vector machine to the observations,
which allows us to compute the evidence for the presence of the signal and
compute the more probable signal. The method would be suited for analyzing data
from experimental instruments onboard space missions and rockets aiming at
detecting spectropolarimetric signals in unexplored regions of the spectrum

function to infer the spatial clustering and find a clustering length of r0=
7.2+-0.6 h^{-1} Mpc and a slope of \gamma=1.48+-0.12, which corresponds to a
bias of b=2.26+-0.16. Using two different halo bias models, we consistently
estimate an average dark-matter host halo mass of Mh\sim 1.3 (+-0.3) x 10^{13}
h^{-1} M_sun. The X-ray AGN bias and the corresponding dark-matter host halo
mass, are significantly higher than the corresponding values of optically
selected AGN (at the same redshifts). %indicating different populations of AGN.
The redshift evolution of the X-ray selected AGN bias indicates, in agreement
with other recent studies, that a unique dark-matter halo mass does not fit
well the bias at all the different redshifts probed.
  Furthermore, we investigate if there is a dependence of the clustering
strength on X-ray luminosity. To this end we consider only 650 sources around
z~1 and we apply a procedure to disentangle the dependence of clustering on
redshift. We find indications for a positive dependence of the clustering
length on X-ray luminosity, in the sense that the more luminous sources have a
larger clustering length and hence a higher dark-matter halo mass. In detail we
find for an average luminosity difference of \delta\log_{10} L_x ~ 1 a halo
mass difference of a factor of ~3.
  These findings appear to be consistent with a galaxy-formation model where
the gas accreted onto the supermassive black hole in intermediate luminosity
AGN comes mostly from the hot-halo atmosphere around the host galaxy.

imposing constraints on the variance of Y and the covariance matrix of X, a

hierarchical procedure is proposed, which uses the nested structures of the

sixteen likelihoods. Artificial and real data show that these models have very
good clustering and classification performance and that the algorithm is able
to recover the parameters very well.

microscopic dynamics is via the Mori-Zwanzig-Forster projection operator
technique with slowly varying variables such as the one-particle density. Here,
we use the projection operator approach to extend DDFT into various directions:
first, we generalize DDFT toward mixtures of $n$ different species of spherical
colloidal particles. We show that there are in general nontrivial
cross-coupling terms between the concentration fields and specify them
explicitly for colloidal mixtures with pairwise hydrodynamic interactions.
Secondly, we treat the energy density as an additional slow variable and derive
formal expressions for an extended DDFT containing also the energy density. The
latter approach can in principle be applied to colloidal dynamics in a nonzero
temperature gradient. For the case without hydrodynamic interactions the
diffusion tensor is diagonal, while thermodiffusion -- the dissipative
cross-coupling term between energy density and concentration -- is nonzero in
this limit. With finite hydrodynamic interactions also cross-diffusion
coefficients assume a finite value. We demonstrate that our results for the
extended DDFT contain the transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic limit

a dense colloidal suspension is presented. Starting point is the Smoluchowski
equation for $N$ bath and a single probe particle. The probe performs Brownian
motion under the influence of a strong constant and uniform external force
$\Fex$. It is immersed in a dense homogeneous bath of (different) particles
also performing Brownian motion. Fluid and glass states are considered; solvent
flow effects are neglected. Based on a formally exact generalized Green-Kubo
relation, mode coupling approximations are performed and an integration through
transients approach applied. A first-principles theory for the nonlinear
velocity-force relations of the probe particle in a dense fluid and for the
(de-) localized probe in a glass is obtained.
  It extends the mode coupling theory of the glass transition to strongly
forced tracer motion and describes active microrheology experiments. A force
threshold is identified which needs to be overcome to pull the probe particle
free in a glass. For the model of hard sphere particles, the microscopic
equations for the threshold force and the probability density of the localized
probe are solved numerically. Neglecting the spatial structure of the theory, a
schematic model is derived which contains two types of bifurcation, the glass
transition and the force-induced delocalization, and which allows for
analytical and numerical solutions. We discuss its phase diagram, forcing
effects on the time-dependent correlation functions, and the friction
increment. The model was successfully applied to simulations and experiments on
colloidal hard sphere systems [I. Gazuz et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 248302

An observation that has been carried out in this paper by capturing a job

controlled by certain factors such as job scheduling and load balancing.
Therefore, in this paper the efficiency of Round Robin (RR) scheduling strategy

include three objects which were not detected in the 2002 5GHz MERLIN

new supernova remnant shell. Flux density variations, in the long (1981 to

We find that flux densities of SNRs in M82 stay constant in most of the sample
(~95%). In addition, aside from SN2008iz and the well-known variable source
41.95+57.5, two sources display short and medium term variations over the

based on the preparation and measurement of qubits in two alternative bases
differing by an angle of pi/2. Any real implementation of the protocol, though,
will inevitably introduce misalignments in the preparation of the states and in
the alignment of the measurement bases with respect to this ideal situation.
Various security proofs take into account (at least partially) such errors,
i.e., show how Alice and Bob can still distil a secure key in the presence of
these imperfections. Here, we consider the complementary problem: how can Eve
exploit misalignments to obtain more information about the key than would be
possible in an ideal implementation? Specifically, we investigate the effects
of misalignment errors on the security of the BB84 protocol in the case of
individual attacks, where necessary and sufficient conditions for security are
known. Though the effects of these errors are small for expected deviations
from the perfect situation, our results nevertheless show that Alice and Bob
can incorrectly conclude that they have established a secure key if the
inevitable experimental errors in the state preparation and in the alignment of
the measurements are not taken into account. This gives further weight to the
idea that the formulation and security analysis of any quantum cryptography
protocol should be based on realistic assumptions about the properties of the
apparatus used. Additionally, we note that BB84 seems more robust against
alignment imperfections if both the x and z bases are used to generate the key.

information across genes when estimating means and variances or identifying

hierarchical model structure suggested by Kendziorski et al. [Stat. Med. (2003)
22 3899-3914] in which the first level describes the distribution of latent
mean expression levels among genes and among differentially expressed
treatments within a gene. The second level describes the conditional
distribution, given a latent mean, of repeated observations for a single gene
and treatment. Many of these models, including those used in Kendziorski's et
al. [Stat. Med. (2003) 22 3899-3914] EBarrays package, assume that expression
level changes due to treatment effects have the same distribution as expression
level changes from gene to gene. We present empirical evidence that this
assumption is often inadequate and propose three-level hierarchical models as
extensions to the two-level log-normal based EBarrays models to address this
inadequacy. We demonstrate that use of our three-level models dramatically
changes analysis results for a variety of microarray data sets and verify the

the Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxy LeoI, including 106 RR Lyrae stars and
51 Cepheids. So far, this is the largest sample of Cepheids and the largest
Cepheids to RR Lyrae ratio found in such a kind of galaxy. The comparison with
other Local Group dwarf spheroidals, Carina and Fornax, shows that the period
distribution of RR Lyrae stars is quite similar, suggesting similar properties
of the parent populations, whereas the Cepheid period distribution in LeoI
peaks at longer periods (P \sim 1.26d instead of ~0.5d) and spans over a
broader range, from 0.5 to 1.78d.
  Evolutionary and pulsation predictions indicate, assuming a mean metallicity
peaked within -1.5<= [Fe/H]<=-1.3, that the current sample of LeoI Cepheids
traces a unique mix of Anomalous Cepheids (blue extent of the red--clump,
partially electron degenerate central helium-burning stars) and short-period
classical Cepheids (blue-loop, quiescent central helium-burning stars). Current
evolutionary prescriptions also indicate that the transition mass between the
two different groups of stars is MHeF \sim 2.1 Mo, and it is constant for stars
metal-poorer than [Fe/H]\sim-0.7. Finally, we briefly outline the different
implications of the current findings on the star formation history of LeoI.

This allows for asymptotic analysis of the control problem. Applications to

the development of an organism has been broadly recognized. The identification
of interactions between genetic factors has been progressively pursued via
statistical or machine learning approaches. A large body of currently adopted
methods, either parametrically or nonparametrically, predominantly focus on
pairwise single marker interaction analysis. As genes are the functional units

conceptually propose a gene-centric framework for genome-wide gene-gene
interaction detection. We treat each gene as a testing unit and derive a
model-based kernel machine method for two-dimensional genome-wide scanning of
gene-gene interactions. In addition to the biological advantage, our method is
statistically appealing because it reduces the number of hypotheses tested in a
genome-wide scan. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the
performance of the method. The utility of the method is further demonstrated
with applications to two real data sets. Our method provides a conceptual
framework for the identification of gene-gene interactions which could shed

latter two structures are related to Schnyder realizers for maximally planar
graphs. We prove that planar Laman graphs are exactly the class of graphs that
have an angular structure that is a tree, called angular tree, and that every
angular tree has a corresponding angle labeling and edge labeling.
  Using a combination of these powerful combinatorial structures, we show that
every planar Laman graph has an L-contact representation, that is, planar Laman
graphs are contact graphs of axis-aligned L-shapes. Moreover, we show that
planar Laman graphs and their subgraphs are the only graphs that can be
represented this way.

We make use of the chiral unitary approach where these two resonances appear as
composite states of two mesons, dynamically generated by the meson-meson
interaction provided by chiral Lagrangians. We obtain a very narrow shape for
the $f_0(980)$ production in agreement with a BES experiment. As to the amount
of isospin violation, or $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ mixing, assuming constant
vertices for the primary $\eta(1405)\rightarrow \pi^{0}K\bar{K}$ and
$\eta(1405)\rightarrow \pi^{0}\pi^{0}\eta$ production, we find results which
are much smaller than found in the recent experimental BES paper, but
consistent with results found in two other related BES experiments. We have
tried to understand this anomaly by assuming an I=1 mixture in the $\eta(1405)$
wave function, but this leads to a much bigger width of the $f_0(980)$ mass
distribution than observed experimentally. The problem is solved by using the
primary production driven by $\eta' \to K^* \bar K$ followed by $K^* \to K
\pi$, which induces an extra singularity in the loop functions needed to
produce the $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ resonances. Improving upon earlier work
along the same lines, and using the chiral unitary approach, we can now predict
absolute values for the ratio $\Gamma(\pi^0, \pi^+ \pi^-)/\Gamma(\pi^0, \pi^0
\eta)$ which are in fair agreement with experiment. We also show that the same
results hold if we had the $\eta(1475)$ resonance or a mixture of these two
states, as seems to be the case in the BES experiment.

  Aims: The hot Jupiter system tau Bootis is one of the nearest (d=15 pc)

in P~3.3 days, similar to the orbital period of the planet. From the well
established correlation between stellar rotation and radio luminosity, it is
conceivable that the tau Bootis system emits strong radio emission at
significantly higher frequencies than currently probed, which we aimed to
investigate with this work.
  Methods: We observed tau Bootis with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope
(WSRT) at a frequency of 1.7 GHz. for 12 hours in spectral line mode, reaching
a noise level of 42 microJy/beam at the position of the target.
  Results: No 18cm radio emission is detected from tau Bootis, resulting in a 3
sigma upper limit of 0.13 mJy, corresponding to a 18cm radio luminosity of
<3.7e13 erg/s/Hz. We observe tau Bootis to be two orders of magnitude fainter
than expected from the stellar relation between radio luminosity and rotation
velocity.
  Conclusions: This implies that either the tau Bootis system is underluminous
in the radio compared to similar fast-rotating stars, or that we happened to
observe the target during a low state of radio emission.

  With the help of the 50:50 beam splitter, variable beam splitter and an
auxiliary photon, we can concentrate a less-entangled single-photon state into
a maximally single-photon entangled state with some probability. The first
protocol is implemented with linear optics and the second protocol is
implemented with the cross-Kerr nonlinearity. Our two protocols do not need two
pairs of entangled states shared by the two parties, which makes our protocols
more economic. Especially, in the second protocol, with the help of the
cross-Kerr nonlinearity, the sophisticated single photon detector is not

  Locomotion",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One way of controlling friction and associated energy losses is to engineer a
deterministic structural pattern on the surface of the rubbing parts (i.e.,
texture engineering). Custom texturing enhances the quality of lubrication,
reduces friction, and allows the use of lubricants of lower viscosity. To date,
a standardized procedure to generate deterministic texture constructs is
virtually non-existent. Many engineers, therefore, study natural species to
explore surface construction and to probe the role surface topography assumes
in friction control. Snakes offer rich examples of surfaces where topological
features allow the optimization and control of frictional behavior. In this
paper, we investigate the frictional behavior of a constrictor type reptile,
Python regius. The study employed a specially designed tribo-acoustic probe
capable of measuring the coefficient of friction and detecting the acoustical
behavior of the skin in vivo. The results confirm the anisotropy of the
frictional response of snakeskin. The coefficient of friction depends on the
direction of sliding: the value in forward motion is lower than that in the
converse direction. Detailed analysis of the surface metrological feature
reveal that tuning frictional response in snakes originates from the
hierarchical nature of surface topology combined to the profile asymmetry of
surface micro-features, and the variation of the curvature of the contacting
scales at different body regions. Such a combination affords the reptile the
ability to optimize the frictional response.

\mathcal{E})$ with $|V|=n, |\mathcal{E}|=m$, and we assume that $\mathcal{E}$
is a test cover, i.e. for every pair of vertices $x_i, x_j$, there exists an
edge $e \in \mathcal{E}$ such that $|{x_i,x_j}\cap e|=1$. The objective is to
find a minimum subset of $\mathcal{E}$ which is a test cover. The problem is
used for identification across many areas, and is NP-complete. From a
parameterized complexity standpoint, many natural parameterizations of {\sc
Test Cover} are either $W[1]$-complete or have no polynomial kernel unless
$coNP\subseteq NP/poly$, and thus are unlikely to be solveable efficiently.
  However, in practice the size of the edges is often bounded. In this paper we
study the parameterized complexity of {\sc Test-$r$-Cover}, the restriction of
{\sc Test Cover} in which each edge contains at most $r \ge 2$ vertices. In
contrast to the unbounded case, we show that the following below-bound
parameterizations of {\sc Test-$r$-Cover} are fixed-parameter tractable with a
polynomial kernel: (1) Decide whether there exists a test cover of size $n-k$,
and (2) decide whether there exists a test cover of size $m-k$, where $k$ is
the parameter. In addition, we prove a new lower bound $\lceil
\frac{2(n-1)}{r+1} \rceil$ on the minimum size of a test cover when the size of
each edge is bounded by $r$. {\sc Test-$r$-Cover} parameterized above this
bound is unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable; in fact, we show that it is
para-NP-complete, as it is NP-hard to decide whether an instance of {\sc
Test-$r$-Cover} has a test cover of size exactly $\frac{2(n-1)}{r+1}$.

$\sigma^2P_n\tra{P_n}$ where $P_n$ is some known $n\times n$-matrix. We
construct a statistical procedure to estimate $s$ as well as under moment
condition on $Y$ or Gaussian hypothesis. Both cases are developed for known or
unknown $\sigma^2$. Our approach is free from any prior assumption on $s$ and
is based on non-asymptotic model selection methods. Given some linear spaces
collection $\{S_m,\ m\in\M\}$, we consider, for any $m\in\M$, the least-squares
estimator $\hat{s}_m$ of $s$ in $S_m$. Considering a penalty function that is
not linear in the dimensions of the $S_m$'s, we select some $\hat{m}\in\M$ in
order to get an estimator $\hat{s}_{\hat{m}}$ with a quadratic risk as close as
possible to the minimal one among the risks of the $\hat{s}_m$'s.
Non-asymptotic oracle-type inequalities and minimax convergence rates are
proved for $\hat{s}_{\hat{m}}$. A special attention is given to the estimation
of a non-parametric component in additive models. Finally, we carry out a
simulation study in order to illustrate the performances of our estimators in
practice.

propagating along photospheric uniformly twisted flux tubes with axial mass
flows become unstable as a consequence of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. We
employed the dispersion relations of kink waves derived from the linearised
magnetohydrodynamic equations. We assumed real wave numbers and complex angular
wave frequencies, namely complex wave phase velocities. The dispersion
relations were solved numerically at fixed input parameters and several mass
flow velocities. We show that the stability of the waves depends upon four
parameters, the density contrast between the flux tube and its environment, the
ratio of the background magnetic fields in the two media, the twist of the
magnetic field lines inside the tube, and the value of the Alfven-Mach number
(the ratio of the jet velocity to Alfv\'en speed inside the flux tube). At
certain densities and magnetic field twists, an instability of the
Kelvin-Helmholtz type of kink (m = 1) mode can arise if the Alfven-Mach number
exceeds a critical value. The observed mass flows may trigger the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability of the kink (m = 1) mode in weakly twisted
photospheric magnetic flux tubes at critical Alfven-Mach numbers lower that
those in untwisted tubes if the magnetic field twist lies in the range
0.36--0.4 and the flow speed exceeds a critical value. A weak external magnetic
field (with a ratio to the magnetic field inside the tube in the range
0.1--0.5) slightly increases that critical value.

in a wide range of multicast networks. Network coding over a large finite field
size has been shown to be a theoretically efficient solution to the index
coding problem. However the high computational complexity of packet encoding
and decoding over a large finite field size, and its subsequent penalty on
encoding and decoding throughput and higher energy cost makes it unsuitable for
practical implementation in processor and energy constraint devices like mobile
phones and wireless sensors. While network coding over GF(2) can alleviate
these concerns, it comes at a tradeoff cost of degrading throughput
performance. To address this tradeoff, we propose a throughput optimal
triangular network coding scheme over GF(2). We show that such a coding scheme
can supply unlimited number of innovative packets and the decoding involves the
simple back substitution. Such a coding scheme provides an efficient solution
to the index coding problem and its lower computation and energy cost makes it
suitable for practical implementation on devices with limited processing and
energy capacity.

Clustering. This new technique is based on the practical variants of the two
constructive versions of the Regularity Lemma, a very useful tool in graph
theory. The lemma claims that every graph can be partitioned into pseudo-random
graphs. While the Regularity Lemma has become very important in proving
theoretical results, it has no direct practical applications so far. An
important reason for this lack of practical applications is that the graph
under consideration has to be astronomically large. This requirement makes its
application restrictive in practice where graphs typically are much smaller. In
this paper we propose modifications of the constructive versions of the
Regularity Lemma that work for smaller graphs as well. We call this the
Practical Regularity partitioning algorithm. The partition obtained by this is
used to build the reduced graph which can be viewed as a compressed
representation of the original graph. Then we apply a pairwise clustering
method such as spectral clustering on this reduced graph to get a clustering of
the original graph that we call Regularity Clustering. We present results of
using Regularity Clustering on a number of benchmark datasets and compare them
with standard clustering techniques, such as $k$-means and spectral clustering.
These empirical results are very encouraging. Thus in this paper we report an
attempt to harness the power of the Regularity Lemma for real-world
applications.

negatively charged antiparticles. This situation is reversed for CC

will produce electron beams capable of damaging the acceleration structures and
the beam line vacuum chambers in the event of an aberrant accelerator pulse.
The accelerator is being designed with the capability to operate with up to
3000 bunches per macro-pulse, 5Hz repetition rate and 1.5 GeV beam energy. It
will be able to sustain an average beam power of 72 KW at the bunch charge of
3.2 nC. Operation at full intensity will deposit enough energy in niobium
material to approach the melting point of 2500 {\deg}C. In the early phase with
only 3 cryomodules installed the facility will be capable of generating
electron beam energies of 810 MeV and an average beam power that approaches 40
KW. In either case a robust Machine Protection System (MPS) is required to
mitigate effects due to such large damage potentials. This paper will describe
the MPS system being developed, the system requirements and the controls issues
under consideration.

ellipsoidal statistical Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (ES-BGK) collision operator via
the Hermite moment representation. The resulting lattice ES-BGK model uses a
single distribution function and features an adjustable Prandtl number.
Numerical simulations show that using a moderate discrete velocity set, this
model can accurately recover steady and transient solutions of the ES-BGK
equation in the slip-flow and early transition regimes in the small Mach number
limit that is typical of microscale problems of practical interest. In the
transition regime in particular, comparisons with numerical solutions of the
ES-BGK model, direct Monte Carlo and low-variance deviational Monte Carlo
simulations show good accuracy for values of the Knudsen number up to
approximately 0.5. On the other hand, highly non-equilibrium phenomena
characterized by high Mach numbers, such as viscous heating and force-driven
Poiseuille flow for large values of the driving force, are more difficult to
capture quantitatively in the transition regime using discretizations chosen
with computational efficiency in mind such as the one used here, although
improved accuracy is observed as the number of discrete velocities is
increased.

axion field which obeys constant shift symmetry. In the usual axion (natural)
inflation, the axion decay constant is predicted to be in the super-Planckian
regime which is believed to be incompatible with an effective field theory
framework. With a novel mechanism originating from a higher derivative kinetic
gravity braiding (KGB) of an axion field we found that there exist a huge
parameter regime in our model where axion decay constant could be naturally
sub-Planckian. Thanks to the KGB which effectively reduces the Planck constant.
This effectively reduced Planck scale provides us the mechanism of further
lowering down the speed of an axion field rolling down its potential without
introducing super-Planckian axion decay constant. We also find that with that
wide range of parameter values, our model induces almost scale invariant power
spectrum as observed in CMB experiments.

quadrupole can get leaked to the higher multipoles due to the non-circular beam

probes for the symmetry-breaking mechanisms. Since the Standard Model does not
involve massive neutrinos, baryon or lepton number violations and the cold dark
matter particle, there are great expectations in search for physics beyond the
Standard Model. The LHC experiments reported no new physics, except for the
appearance of the 125 GeV heavy resonance. If this resonance turns out to be a
Higgs boson, we shall be faced with the paradox that the Standard Model, as a
theoretically and experimentally incomplete and defective theory, is confirmed.
If, on the other hand, this resonance is a scalar or pseudoscalar meson - a
mixture of a (pseudo)scalar glueball and toponium, one has to study alternative
symmetry-breaking mechanisms. This paper is devoted to the evaluations of the
gauge invariant electroweak functions that are relevant for the suppressed
electroweak processes within the SM or the UV finite theory in which the
noncontractible space breaks the gauge symmetry. Deviations from the SM
amplitudes range from 10% to 30%, thus being measurable at the LHCb and future
superB factories. The most recent result of the LHCb, measuring certain B meson
branching fraction, appears to be lower than the SM prediction, thus favouring
our theory of noncontractible space.
