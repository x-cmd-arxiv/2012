that such belief is not supported by empirical evidence. We consider thirteen
major publication outlets in science, and perform systematic comparisons
between the citations accumulated by commented and non commented articles. We
find that (i) commented papers are, on average, much more cited than non

most cited papers of a journal. Since comments are published soon after
criticized papers, comments should be viewed as early indicators of the future

the nucleosynthesis and the observed abundance of $^{12}$C in stars. The theory
of this process is well established at high temperatures but rather ambiguous
in the low temperature regime where measurements are impossible. Purpose:
Develop a new three-body method, which tackles properly the scattering boundary
condition for three charged particles and takes into account both the resonant
and the non-resonant reaction mechanisms on the same footing, to compute the
triple-alpha reaction rate at low temperatures. Methods: We combine the
R-matrix expansion, the R-matrix propagation method, and the screening
technique in the hyperspherical harmonics basis. Results: Both the $2^+_1$
bound state and the $0^+_2$ resonant state in $^{12}$C are well reproduced. We
also study the cluster structure of these states. We calculate the triple-alpha
reaction rate for $\mathrm{T}=0.01-0.1$ GK. Conclusions: We obtain the same
rate as NACRE for temperatures above 0.07 GK, but the new rate is largely
enhanced at lower temperatures ($\approx 10^{12}$ at 0.02 GK). The differences
are caused by the direct capture contribution to the reaction when three alpha
particles can not reach the resonant energies.

wireless service providers (WSPs) have begun encouraging users to offload some
of their traffic onto supplementary network technologies, e.g., offloading from
3G or 4G to WiFi or femtocells. With the growing popularity of such offerings,
a deeper understanding of the underlying economic principles and their impact
on technology adoption is necessary. To this end, we develop a model for user
adoption of a base technology (e.g., 3G) and a bundle of the base plus a
supplementary technology (e.g., 3G + WiFi). Users individually make their
adoption decisions based on several factors, including the technologies'
intrinsic qualities, negative congestion externalities from other subscribers,
and the flat access rates that a WSP charges. We then show how these user-level
decisions translate into aggregate adoption dynamics and prove that these
converge to a unique equilibrium for a given set of exogenously determined
system parameters. We fully characterize these equilibria and study adoption
behaviors of interest to a WSP. We then derive analytical expressions for the
revenue-maximizing prices and optimal coverage factor for the supplementary

Finally, we develop a mobile app to collect empirical 3G/WiFi usage data and
numerically investigate the profit-maximizing adoption levels when a WSP

the environment influences the optimal allocation of neurons and spikes in a
population that represents that variable. We start with a conventional response
model, in which the spikes of each neuron are drawn from a Poisson distribution
with a mean rate governed by an associated tuning curve. For this model, we
approximate the Fisher information in terms of the density and amplitude of the
tuning curves, under the assumption that tuning width varies inversely with
cell density. We consider a family of objective functions based on the expected
value, over the sensory prior, of a functional of the Fisher information. This
family includes lower bounds on mutual information and perceptual
discriminability as special cases. For all cases, we obtain a closed form
expression for the optimum, in which the density and gain of the cells in the
population are power law functions of the stimulus prior. Thus, the allocation
of these resources is uniquely specified by the prior. Since perceptual
discriminability may be expressed directly in terms of the Fisher information,
it too will be a power law function of the prior. We show that these results
hold for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and correlated neuronal variability.
This framework thus provides direct and experimentally testable predictions
regarding the relationship between sensory priors, tuning properties of neural
representations, and perceptual discriminability.

protein in the plasma membrane of P. falciparum, the parasite that causes the
most severe form of malaria. The current literature has established the science
of PfAQP's structure, functions, and hydrogen-bonding interactions but left
unanswered the following fundamental question: Does glycerol modulate water
permeation through aquaglyceroporin that conducts both glycerol and water? This
paper provides an affirmative answer to this question of essential importance
to the protein's functions. On the basis of the chemical-potential profile of
glycerol from the extracellular bulk region, throughout PfAQP's conducting
channel, to the cytoplasmic bulk region, this study shows the existence of a
bound state of glycerol inside aquaglyceroporin's permeation pore, from which
the dissociation constant is approximately 14 microM. A glycerol molecule
occupying the bound state occludes the conducting pore through which permeating
molecules line up in single file by hydrogen-bonding with one another and with
the luminal residues of aquaglyceroporin. In this way, glycerol inhibits
permeation of water and other permeants through aquaglyceroporin. The
biological implications of this theory are discussed and shown to agree with
the existent in vitro data. It turns out that the structure of aquaglyceroporin
is perfect for the van der Waals interactions between the protein and glycerol
to cause the existence of the bound state deep inside the conducting pore and,
thus, to play an unexpected but significant role in aquaglyceroporin's
functions.

resource access: Cournot and Stackelberg games. Five CR scenes are analysed:
simultaneous access of unlicensed users (commons regime) with symmetric and
asymmetric costs, with and without bandwidth constraints and sequential access
(licensed against unlicensed). Several equilibrium concepts are studied as game
solutions: Nash, Pareto and the joint NashPareto equilibrium. The latter
captures a game situation where players are non-homogeneous users, exhibiting
different types of rationality, Nash and Pareto. This enables a more realistic
modelling of interactions on a CR scene. An evolutionary game equilibrium
detection method is used. The Nash equilibrium indicates the maximum number of
channels a CR may access without decreasing its payoff. The Pareto equilibrium
describes a larger range of payoffs, capturing unbalanced as well as equitable
solutions. The analysis of the Stackelberg modelling shows that payoffs are
maximised for all users if the incumbents are Nash oriented and the new
entrants are Pareto driven.

pressure or seismic records, from anywhere on Earth, contain noise with
dominant periods between 3 and 10 seconds, that is believed to be excited by
ocean surface gravity waves. Most of this noise is explained by a nonlinear
wave-wave interaction mechanism, and takes the form of surface gravity waves,
acoustic or seismic waves. Previous theoretical works on seismic noise focused
on surface (Rayleigh) waves, and did not consider finite depth effects on the
generating wave kinematics. These finite depth effects are introduced here,
which requires the consideration of the direct wave-induced pressure at the
ocean bottom, a contribution previously overlooked in the context of seismic
noise. That contribution can lead to a considerable reduction of the seismic
noise source, which is particularly relevant for noise periods larger than 10
s. The theory is applied to acoustic waves in the atmosphere, extending
previous theories that were limited to vertical propagation only. Finally, the
noise generation theory is also extended beyond the domain of Rayleigh waves,
giving the first quantitative expression for sources of seismic body waves. In
the limit of slow phase speeds in the ocean wave forcing, the known and
well-verified gravity wave result is obtained, which was previously derived for
an incompressible ocean. The noise source of acoustic, acoustic-gravity and
seismic modes are given by a mode-specific amplification of the same

idea is to use the invariant grid equation, which determines the locations of

then to project the obtained solution to the regular grid using invariant
interpolation schemes. This guarantees that the scheme is invariant and allows
one to work on the simpler stationary grids. The discretization errors of the

policy that achieves queue stability and a reasonable delay performance. In
most of the existing literature, it is assumed that optimal MWQ policy can be
obtained instantaneously at every time slot. However, this assumption may be
unrealistic in time varying wireless systems, especially when there is no
closed-form MWQ solution and iterative algorithms have to be applied to obtain
the optimal solution. This paper investigates the convergence behavior and the
queue delay performance of the conventional MWQ iterations in which the channel
state information (CSI) and queue state information (QSI) are changing in a
similar timescale as the algorithm iterations. Our results are established by
studying the stochastic stability of an equivalent virtual stochastic dynamic
system (VSDS), and an extended Foster-Lyapunov criteria is applied for the
stability analysis. We derive a closed form delay bound of the wireless network
in terms of the CSI fading rate and the sensitivity of MWQ policy over CSI and
QSI. Based on the equivalent VSDS, we propose a novel MWQ iterative algorithm
with compensation to improve the tracking performance. We demonstrate that
under some mild conditions, the proposed modified MWQ algorithm converges to
the optimal MWQ control despite the time-varying CSI and QSI.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time series classification is a field which has drawn much attention over the
past decade. A new approach for classification of time series uses
classification trees based on shapelets. A shapelet is a subsequence extracted
from one of the time series in the dataset. A disadvantage of this approach is
the time required for building the shapelet-based classification tree. The
search for the best shapelet requires examining all subsequences of all lengths
from all time series in the training set.
  A key goal of this work was to find an evaluation order of the shapelets
space which enables fast convergence to an accurate model. The comparative
analysis we conducted clearly indicates that a random evaluation order yields
the best results. Our empirical analysis of the distribution of high-quality
shapelets within the shapelets space provides insights into why randomized
shapelets sampling is superior to alternative evaluation orders.
  We present an algorithm for randomized model generation for shapelet-based
classification that converges extremely quickly to a model with surprisingly
high accuracy after evaluating only an exceedingly small fraction of the
shapelets space.

physiologically based mathematical models of sleep regulation that account for
the neuronal dynamics responsible for the regulation of sleep-wake cycles and
allow detailed examination of the underlying mechanisms. Neuronal systems in
general, and those involved in sleep regulation in particular, are noisy and
heterogeneous by their nature. It has been shown in various systems that
certain levels of noise and diversity can significantly improve signal
encoding. However, these phenomena, especially the effects of diversity, are
rarely considered in the models of sleep regulation. The present paper is
focused on a neuron-based physiologically motivated model of sleep-wake cycles
that proposes a novel mechanism of the homeostatic regulation of sleep based on
the dynamics of a wake-promoting neuropeptide orexin. Here this model is
generalized by the introduction of intrinsic diversity and noise in the
orexin-producing neurons in order to study the effect of their presence on the
sleep-wake cycle. A quantitative measure of the quality of a sleep-wake cycle
is introduced and used to systematically study the generalized model for
different levels of noise and diversity. The model is shown to exhibit a clear
diversity-induced resonance: that is, the best wake-sleep cycle turns out to
correspond to an intermediate level of diversity at the synapses of the
orexin-producing neurons. On the other hand only a mild evidence of stochastic
resonance is found when the level of noise is varied. These results show that
disorder, especially in the form of quenched diversity, can be a key-element
for an efficient or optimal functioning of the homeostatic regulation of the
sleep-wake cycle. Furthermore, this study provides an example of constructive
role of diversity in a neuronal system that can be extended beyond the system
studied here.

carried out one set of non-radiative simulations, and two sets of simulations

one of which also accounting for the effect of feedback from active galactic
nuclei (AGN). The analysis is carried out with the twofold aim of studying the
implication of stellar and hot gas content on the relative role played by SN
and AGN feedback, and to calibrate the cluster baryon fraction and its
evolution as a cosmological tool. We find that both radiative simulation sets
predict a trend of stellar mass fraction with cluster mass that tends to be
weaker than the observed one. However this tension depends on the particular
set of observational data considered. Including the effect of AGN feedback
alleviates this tension on the stellar mass and predicts values of the hot gas
mass fraction and total baryon fraction to be in closer agreement with
observational results. We further compute the ratio between the cluster baryon
content and the cosmic baryon fraction, Y_b, as a function of cluster-centric
radius and redshift. At R_500 we find for massive clusters with

geometry and canonical quantum gravity is presented. The approach is built
around a *-algebra generated by local holonomy-diffeomorphisms on a 3-manifold
and a quantized Dirac type operator; the two capturing the kinematics of
quantum gravity formulated in terms of Ashtekar variables. We prove that the
separable part of the spectrum of the algebra is contained in the space of
measurable connections modulo gauge transformations and we give limitations to
the non-separable part. The construction of the Dirac type operator -- and thus
the application of noncommutative geometry -- is motivated by the requirement
of diffeomorphism invariance. We conjecture that a semi-finite spectral triple,
which is invariant under volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, arise from a GNS
construction of a semi-classical state. Key elements of quantum field theory
emerge from the construction in a semi-classical limit, as does an almost
commutative algebra. Finally, we note that the spectrum of loop quantum gravity
emerges from a discretization of our construction. Certain convergence issues
are left unresolved. This paper is the first of two where the second paper is
concerned with mathematical details and proofs concerning the spectrum of the
holonomy-diffeomorphism algebra.

spatially irregular morphology and larger characteristic angular scales can
help to distinguish this SZ signature from that of clusters. In addition to

been an active research area in recent years. Both forward security and
backward security are required to maintain the privacy of a tag, i.e., exposure
of a tag's secret key should not reveal the past or future secret keys of the
tag. We envisage the need for a formal model for backward security for RFID
protocol designs in shared key settings, since the RFID tags are too
resource-constrained to support public key settings. However, there has not
been much research on backward security for shared key environment since Serge
Vaudenay in his Asiacrypt 2007 paper showed that perfect backward security is
impossible to achieve without public key settings. We propose a Privacy
Preserving RFID Authentication Protocol for shared key environment, APRAP,
which minimizes the damage caused by secret key exposure using insulated keys.
Even if a tag's secret key is exposed during an authentication session, forward
security and 'restricted' backward security of the tag are preserved under our
assumptions. The notion of 'restricted' backward security is that the adversary
misses the protocol transcripts which are needed to update the compromised
secret key. Although our definition does not capture perfect backward security,
it is still suitable for effective implementation as the tags are highly mobile
in practice. We also provide a formal security model of APRAP. Our scheme is
more efficient than previous proposals from the viewpoint of computational
requirements.

ferroelectricity in artificial tri-layer superlattices consisting solely of

below 40 K exhibiting strong tunability by superlattice periodicity.
Furthermore, magnetoelectric coupling resulted in 150% magnetic modulation of
the polarization. Density functional calculations indicate that broken space
inversion symmetry and mixed valency, because of cationic asymmetry and
interfacial polar discontinuity, respectively, give rise to the observed
behavior. Our results demonstrate the engineering of asymmetric layered

approach relies only on end-to-end measurements, unlike literature approaches

make use of compressed sensing theory to estimate delays on each hop between

critical hops that contribute to the abrupt delay increases. To demonstrate its

(RFID) tags is of much interest nowadays. Resistance against illegal tracking,

authentication scheme. Reader authentication is also necessary to thwart any
illegal attempt to read the tags. With an objective to design a secure and
low-cost RFID authentication protocol, Gene Tsudik proposed a timestamp-based
protocol using symmetric keys, named YA-TRAP*. Although YA-TRAP* achieves its
target security properties, it is susceptible to timing attacks, where the
timestamp to be sent by the reader to the tag can be freely selected by an
adversary. Moreover, in YA-TRAP*, reader authentication is not provided, and a
tag can become inoperative after exceeding its pre-stored threshold timestamp
value. In this paper, we propose two mutual RFID authentication protocols that
aim to improve YA-TRAP* by preventing timing attack, and by providing reader
authentication. Also, a tag is allowed to refresh its pre-stored threshold
value in our protocols, so that it does not become inoperative after exceeding
the threshold. Our protocols also achieve other security properties like
forward security, resistance against cloning, replay, and tracking attacks.
Moreover, the computation and communication costs are kept as low as possible
for the tags. It is important to keep the communication cost as low as possible
when many tags are authenticated in batch-mode. By introducing aggregate
function for the reader-to-server communication, the communication cost is
reduced. We also discuss different possible applications of our protocols. Our
protocols thus capture more security properties and more efficiency than
YA-TRAP*. Finally, we show that our protocols can be implemented using the
current standard low-cost RFID infrastructures.

discrete expanding space-time, only a tiny fraction of the vacuum fluctuations
can become gravitationally effective and act as a driving `dark' agent. The
analytically derived effective vacuum energy density is found to be closely
related to the critical cosmic energy density, thus helping to solve the
cosmological constant problem as well as the coincidence problem. The proposed
model implies that in the present day universe only the vacuum field of the
photon and that of the lightest neutrino contribute to the effective vacuum.
This allows one to fix the neutrino masses within a narrow range. The model
also implies that the (real) universe has to be considered as a
thermodynamically open system which exchanges energy and momentum with the
virtual reservoir of the vacuum.

analysis of the simulation results brings relevant insights on the issue of
autonomy vs. regulation in emerging cognitive radio environments.

  (IJAIT), Vol 3, No 2, pp. 61-74, 2011",,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RFID tags are heavily constrained in computational and storage capabilities,
and raise numerous privacy concerns in everyday life due to their vulnerability
to different attacks. Both forward security and backward security are required
to maintain the privacy of a tag i.e., exposure of a tag's secret key should
not reveal the past or future secret keys of the tag. We envisage the need for
a formal model for backward security for RFID protocol designs in shared key
settings, since the RFID tags are too resource-constrained to support public
key settings. However, there has not been much research on backward security
for shared key environment since Serge Vaudenay in his Asiacrypt 2007 paper
showed that perfect backward security is impossible to achieve without public
key settings. We propose a Key-Insulated Mutual Authentication Protocol for
shared key environment, KIMAP, which minimizes the damage caused by secret key
exposure using insulated keys. Even if a tag's secret key is exposed during an
authentication session, forward security and `restricted' backward security of
the tag are preserved under our assumptions. The notion of `restricted'
backward security is that the adversary misses the protocol transcripts which
are needed to update the compromised secret key. Although our definition does
not capture perfect backward security, it is still suitable for effective
implementation as the tags are highly mobile in practice. We also provide a
formal security model of KIMAP. Our scheme is more efficient than previous
proposals from the viewpoint of computational requirements.

may occur in Cognitive Radio (CR) environments. The approach is that of one
shot, noncooperative games describing CR interactions. Open spectrum access
scenarios are modelled based on continuous and discrete reformulations of the
Cournot game theoretical model. CR interaction situations are described by Nash
and Pareto equilibria. Also, the heterogeneity of players is captured by the
new concept of joint Nash-Pareto equilibrium, allowing CRs to be biased toward
different types of equilibrium. Numerical simulations reveal equilibrium
situations that may be reached in simultaneous access scenarios of two and
three users.
