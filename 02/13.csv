general relativity, which generally can not be extended to modified theories of
gravity. Here we study the validity of the theorem in scalar-tensor theories
using a perturbative approach, and compare the results in the so-called
Einstein and Jordan frames. The implications of the results question the
physical equivalence between both frames, at least in perturbations.

techniques, we construct and study a plethora of ""singularity variables"" meant
to facilitate the difficult tasks of separating signal and backgrounds and of
measuring the mass of a putative signal. The simplest singularity variables are
not invariant under boosts along the collider's axes and the simulation of
their distributions requires a good understanding of parton distribution
functions, perhaps not a serious shortcoming during the boson hunting season.
The derivation of longitudinally boost-invariant variables, which are functions

elaborate. But their use is simple and they are, in a kinematical sense,

the asymptotic connections between Charlier polynomials and special functions,

are studied. Previous results on the influence of the reed resonance frequency
are confirmed. New results concerning the simultaneous influence of two model
parameters on oscillation threshold, regime selection and playing frequency are
presented and discussed. The authors use a numerical continuation approach.
Numerical continuation consists in following a given solution of a set of
equations when a parameter varies. Considering the instrument as a dynamical
system, the oscillation threshold problem is formulated as a path following of
Hopf bifurcations, generalizing the usual approach of the characteristic
equation, as used in previous works. The proposed numerical approach proves to
be useful for the study of musical instruments. It is complementary to
analytical analysis and direct time-domain or frequency-domain simulations
since it allows to derive information that is hardly reachable through
simulation, without the approximations needed for analytical approach.

non-Gaussian L\'evy processes, however, it is difficult to obtain explicit
forms of Fokker-Planck equations because the adjoint operators of the

the present paper, Fokker- Planck equations are derived in terms of infinite

overcome this, Hand (2009) proposed the $H$ measure, which allows a given
researcher to fix the distribution of relative severities to a
classifier-independent setting on a given problem. This note extends the
discussion, and proposes a modified standard distribution for the $H$ measure,

imprinted on the spectrum of the star. The second method relies on the
construction of a stabilized spectrograph externally calibrated in wavelength.
The most precise stabilized spectrometer in operation is HARPS, operated by ESO
in La Silla Observatory/Chile. The Doppler measurements obtained with HARPS are
typically obtained using the Cross-Correlation Function technique (CCF). It
consists of multiplying the stellar spectrum with a weighted binary mask and
finding the minimum of such product as a function of the Doppler shift. It is
known that CCF is suboptimal in exploiting the Doppler information in the
stellar spectrum. Here, we describe an algorithm to obtain precision RV
measurements using least-squares matching of each observed spectrum to a high
signal-to-noise ratio template derived from the same observations. Such
algorithm is implemented in our software called HARPS-TERRA (Template Enhanced
Radial velocity Re-analysis Application). New radial velocity measurements on a
representative sample of stars observed by HARPS is used to illustrate the
benefits of the proposed method. We show that, compared to CCF, template
matching provides a significant improvement in accuracy, specially when applied

communicate with each other while users are in close proximity, can help
applications still exchange data in such cases. In opportunistic networks
routes are built dynamically, as each mobile device acts according to the
store-carry-and-forward paradigm. Thus, contacts between mobile devices are
seen as opportunities to move data towards destination. In such networks data
dissemination is done using forwarding and is usually based on a
publish/subscribe model. Opportunistic data dissemination also raises questions
concerning user privacy and incentives. Such problems are addressed differently
by various opportunistic data dissemination techniques. In this paper we
analyze existing relevant work in the area of data dissemination in
opportunistic networks. We present the categories of a proposed taxonomy that
captures the capabilities of data dissemination techniques used in such
networks. Moreover, we survey relevant data dissemination techniques and

less than 100 days (hot Jupiters), more massive than 9 MJup for periods in the

some steps of the walk. The potential can be unbounded, but it is subject to a
moment assumption whose strictness is tied to the mixing of the environment,
the best case being the i.i.d. environment. We prove that the infinite volume
quenched point-to-point free energy exists and has a variational formula in
terms of an entropy. We establish regularity properties of the point-to-point
free energy, as a function of the potential and as a function on the convex
hull of the admissible steps of the walk, and link it to the infinite volume
free energy and quenched large deviations of the endpoint of the walk. One
corollary is a quenched large deviation principle for random walk in an ergodic
random environment, with a continuous rate function.

hedge risk and speculate on the variation of an asset's future market price. In
short, an option has a particular payout that is based on the market price for
an asset on a given date in the future. In 1973, Black and Scholes proposed a
valuation model for options that essentially estimates the tail risk of the
asset price under the assumption that the price will fluctuate according to
geometric Brownian motion. More recently, DeMarzo et al., among others, have
proposed more robust valuation schemes, where we can even assume an adversary
chooses the price fluctuations. This framework can be considered as a
sequential two-player zero-sum game between the investor and Nature. We analyze
the value of this game in the limit, where the investor can trade at smaller
and smaller time intervals. Under weak assumptions on the actions of Nature (an
adversary), we show that the minimax option price asymptotically approaches
exactly the Black-Scholes valuation. The key piece of our analysis is showing
that Nature's minimax optimal dual strategy converges to geometric Brownian
motion in the limit.

length scale $L= \frac{1}{a^4(t)}\int_0^tdt' a^3(t') $ is motivated from the
four dimensional spacetime volume at cosmic time $t$ in the flat
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe. It is shown that when the background
constituent with constant equation of state $w_m$ dominates the universe in the
early time, the fractional energy density of the dark energy scales as
$\Omega_{de}\simeq \frac94(3+w_m)^2d^2a^2$ with the equation of state given by
$w_{de}\simeq-\frac23 +w_m$. The value of $w_m$ is taken to be $w_m\simeq-1$
during inflation, $w_m=\frac13$ in radiation-dominated epoch and $w_m=0$ in
matter-dominated epoch respectively. When the model parameter $d$ takes the
normal value at order one, the fractional density of dark energy is naturally
negligible in the early universe, $\Omega_{de} \ll 1$ at $a \ll 1$. With such
an analytic feature, the model can be regarded as a single-parameter model like
the $\Lambda$CDM model, so that the present fractional energy density
$\Omega_{de}(a=1)$ can solely be determined by solving the differential
equation of $\Omega_{de}$ once $d$ is given. We further extend the model to the
general case in which both matter and radiation are present. The scenario
involving possible interaction between the dark energy and the background
constituent is also discussed.

non-self-gravitating in this regime, and we examine the effects of varied
magnetic field strength on statistical properties: the density probability
distribution function is approximately lognormal; velocity power spectral
slopes decrease with field strength; alignment between velocity and magnetic
field increases with field; the magnetic field probability distribution can be
fit to a stretched exponential. The high density state is characterized by
self-similar spheres; the density PDF is a power-law; collapse rate decreases

P({\rho},k) \propto k; thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratios are unity for all

numbers in collapsing regions explain recent observations of magnetic influence
decreasing with density. We also find that the high density state is found in
filaments formed by converging flows, consistent with recent Herschel
observations. Possible modifications to existing star formation theories are

show that an Eulerian digraph with $n$ vertices and $m$ arcs has $\beta(G) \ge
m^2/2n^2+m/2n$, and this bound is optimal for infinitely many $m, n$. Using
this result we prove that an Eulerian digraph contains a cycle of length at

$m^2/24n^3$. Both estimates are tight up to a constant factor. Finally,
motivated by a conjecture of Bollob\'as and Scott, we also show how to find
long cycles in Eulerian digraphs.

fractured in an extraordinary pattern under transverse uniaxial elongation in
all but the largest misorientation angle case, which exhibited intermittent
crack propagation and formed many stringy residual connections after quasi
mechanical failure. The strings known as monoatomic carbon chains (MACCs),
whose importance was recently highlighted, gradually extended to a maximum of a
few nanometers as the elongation proceeded. These features, which critically
affect the tensile stress and the shape of stress-strain curve, were observed
in both armchair and zigzag-oriented symmetric tilt GBs. However, there exist
remarkable differences in the population density and the achievable length of
MACCs appearing after quasi mechanical failure which were higher in the
zigzag-oriented GBs. In addition, the maximum stress and ultimate strain for
armchair-oriented GBs were significantly greater than those of zigzag-oriented
GBs in case of the largest misorientation angle while they were slightly
smaller in other cases. The maximum stress was larger as the misorientation
angle increased for both armchair and zigzag-oriented GBs ranging between 32~80
GPa, and the ultimate strains were between 0.06~0.11, the lower limit of which
agrees very well with the experimental value of threshold strain beyond which

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars shows that they exhibit large
overabundances of rubidium (Rb) up to 100--1000 times solar. These observations
set constraints on our theoretical notion of the slow neutron capture process
(s process) that occurs inside intermediate-mass AGB stars. Lithium (Li)
abundances are also reported for these stars. In intermediate-mass AGB stars,
Li can be produced by proton captures occuring at the base of the convective
envelope. For this reason the observations of Rb, Zr, and Li set complementary
constraints on different processes occurring in the same stars. We present
predictions for the abundances of Rb, Zr, and Li as computed for the first time
simultaneously in intermediate-mass AGB star models and compare them to the
current observational constraints. We find that the Rb abundance increases with
increasing stellar mass, as is inferred from observations but we are unable to
match the highest observed [Rb/Fe] abundances. Inclusion of a partial mixing
zone (PMZ) to activate the 13C(a,n)16O reaction as an additional neutron source
yields significant enhancements in the Rb abundance. However this leads to Zr
abundances that exceed the upper limits of the current observational
constraints. If the third dredge-up (TDU) efficiency remains as high during the
final stages of AGB evolution as during the earlier stages, we can match the
lowest values of the observed Rb abundance range. We predict large variations
in the Li abundance, which are observed. Finally, the predicted Rb production
increases with decreasing metallicity, in qualitative agreement with
observations of Magellanic Cloud AGB stars. However stellar models of Z=0.008

also suggest that tidal disruption of dwarf galaxies is another formation
channel for UCD formation in the core of Perseus as tidal disruption is ongoing
in this region as evidenced by shells around NGC 1275. Finally, UCDs may simply
be massive GCs based on strong similarities in the colour trends of the two

average, 0.51 dex higher Pb/Eu ratios compared with that of the r-II stars

Galactic metallicity had grown to [Fe/H] = -2.3. The average Pb/Eu ratio of the

predictions of Travaglio et al. (2001) that AGB stars with [Fe/H] ~ -1 provided

non-negligible fraction of the stellar radiation falls on the long-wavelength
range, and/or that the planetary long-wavelength emission penetrates into the
transparent short wavelength domain of the absorption.
  Second, applying the most general assumptions and independently of any
particular properties of an absorber, we show that the greenhouse effect
saturates and any Earth-like planet has a maximal temperature which depends on
the type of and distance to its main-sequence star, its albedo and the primary
atmospheric components which determine the cutoff frequency below which the
atmosphere is optically thick. For example, a hypothetical convection-less
planet similar to Venus, that is optically thin in the visible, could have at
most a surface temperature of 1200-1300K irrespective of the nature of the
greenhouse gas.
  We show that two primary mechanisms are responsible for the saturation of the
runaway greenhouse effect, depending on the value of the wavelength above which
the atmosphere becomes optically thick. Unless this wavelength is small and
resides in the optical region, saturation is achieved by radiating the thermal
flux of the planet through the short wavelength tail of the thermal
distribution. This has the observational implication, the radiation from such a
planet should be skewed towards the NIR. Otherwise, saturation takes place by
radiating through windows in the FIR.

integer points in integral dilates of $P$. Ehrhart polynomials of polytopes are
often described in terms of their Ehrhart $h^*$-vector (aka Ehrhart
$\delta$-vector), which is the vector of coefficients of $L_P$ with respect to
a certain binomial basis and which coincides with the $h$-vector of a regular
unimodular triangulation of $P$ (if one exists). One important result by
Stanley about $h^*$-vectors of polytopes is that their entries are always
non-negative. However, recent combinatorial applications of Ehrhart theory give
rise to polytopal complexes with $h^*$-vectors that have negative entries.
  In this article we introduce the Ehrhart $f^*$-vector of polytopes or, more
generally, of polytopal complexes $K$. These are again coefficient vectors of
$L_K$ with respect to a certain binomial basis of the space of polynomials and
they have the property that the $f^*$-vector of a unimodular simplicial complex
coincides with its $f$-vector. The main result of this article is a counting
interpretation for the $f^*$-coefficients which implies that $f^*$-coefficients
of integral polytopal complexes are always non-negative integers. This holds
even if the polytopal complex does not have a unimodular triangulation and if
its $h^*$-vector does have negative entries. Our main technical tool is a new
partition of the set of lattice points in a simplicial cone into discrete
cones. Further results include a complete characterization of Ehrhart
polynomials of integral partial polytopal complexes and a non-negativity
theorem for the $f^*$-vectors of rational polytopal complexes.

young star Beta Pictoris, located between 8 AU and 15 AU from the star. This
young planet offers the rare opportunity to monitor a large fraction of the
orbit using the imaging technique over a reasonably short timescale. Using the
NAOS-CONICA adaptive-optics instrument (NACO) at the Very Large Telescope
(VLT), we obtained repeated follow-up images of the Bpic system in the Ks and
L' filters at four new epochs in 2010 and 2011. Complementing these data with
previous measurements, we conduct a homogeneous analysis, which covers more
than eight yrs, to accurately monitor the Bpic b position relative to the star.
On the basis of the evolution of the planet's relative position with time, we
derive the best-fit orbital solutions for our measurements. More reliable
results are found with a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach. The solutions favor
a low-eccentricity orbit e < 0.17, with semi-major axis in the range 8--9 AU
corresponding to orbital periods of 17--21 yrs. Our solutions favor a highly
inclined solution with a peak around i=88.5+-1.7 deg, and a longitude of
ascending node tightly constrained at Omega = -147.5+-1.5 deg. These results
indicate that the orbital plane of the planet is likely to be above the
midplane of the main disk, and compatible with the warp component of the disk
being tilted between 3.5 deg and 4.0 deg. This suggests that the planet plays a
key role in the origin of the inner warped-disk morphology of the Bpic disk.
Finally, these orbital parameters are consistent with the hypothesis that the
planet is responsible for the transit-like event observed in November 1981, and
also linked to the cometary activity observed in the Bpic system.

anti-correlation between the spectral lag and the isotropy luminosity. The

potential (OP) for neutron scattering. Since neutron data is seldom available,
while proton scattering data is more abundant, it is useful to have estimates
of the difference of the neutron and proton optical potentials. This
information is contained in the isospin dependence of the nucleon OP. Here we
attempt to provide it for the nucleon-208Pb system. The goal of this paper is
to obtain accurate n+208Pb scattering data, and use it, together with existing
p+208Pb and 208Pb(p,n)208$Bi*_{IAS} data, to obtain an accurate estimate of the
isospin dependence of the nucleon OP at energies in the 30-60 MeV range. Cross
sections for n+208Pb scattering were measured at 30.4 and 40.0 MeV, with a
typical relative (normalization) accuracy of 2-4% (3%). An angular range of 15
to 130 degrees was covered using the beam-swinger time of flight system at
Michigan State University. These data were analyzed by a consistent optical
model study of the neutron data and of elastic p+208Pb scattering at 45 MeV and
54 MeV. These results were combined with a coupled-channel analysis of the
208Pb(p,n) reaction at 45 MeV, exciting the 0^+ isobaric analog state in 208Bi.
The new data and analysis give an accurate estimate the isospin impurity of the
nucleon-208Pb OP at 30.4 MeV, caused by the Coulomb correction to the proton
OP. The corrections to the real proton OP given by the CH89 global systematics
was found to be only few percent, while for the imaginary potential it was over
20% at the nuclear surface. Based on the analysis of the measured elastic
p+208Pb data at 40 MeV, a Coulomb correction of similar strength and shape was
also predicted for the p+208Pb OP at energy around 54 MeV.

Limits obtained under various physical assumptions are comparable to those

conservative and aggressive limits on additional theories. Using acceptance and
efficiency tables along with the expected and observed numbers of events in

investigated by two dimensional Particle-in-Cell simulations. Magnetic
reconnection is initiated in multiple X points by the tearing instability.
Plasmoids form and grow in size by continuously coalescing. Each chain plasmoid
exhibits a strong out-of plane core magnetic field and an out-of-plane electron
current that drives the coalescing process. The disappearance of the X points
in the coalescence process are due to anti-reconnection, a magnetic
reconnection where the plasma inflow and outflow are reversed with respect to
the original reconnection flow pattern. Anti-reconnection is characterized by
the Hall magnetic field quadrupole signature. Two new kinetic features, not
reported by previous studies of plasmoid chain evolution, are here revealed.
First, intense electric fields develop in-plane normally to the separatrices
and drive the ion dynamics in the plasmoids. Second, several bipolar electric
field structures are localized in proximity of the plasmoid chain. The analysis
of the electron distribution function and phase space reveals the presence of
counter-streaming electron beams, unstable to the two stream instability, and
phase space electron holes along the reconnection separatrices.

it is a gravitating massive body with the dustlike equation of state in the

theories based on the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) or BCS approximations. The
equations of motion for the HFB density matrices are unique and the theory
respects the usual conservation laws defined by commutators of the conserved
quantity with the Hamiltonian. In contrast, the theories based on the BCS
approximation are more problematic. In the usual formulation of TDHF+BCS, the
equation of continuity is violated and one sees unphysical oscillations in
particle densities. This can be ameliorated by freezing the occupation numbers
during the evolution in TDHF+BCS, but there are other problems with the BCS
that make it doubtful for reaction dynamics. We also compare different
numerical implementations of the time-dependent HFB equations. The equations of
motion for the $U$ and $V$ Bogoliubov transformations are not unique, but it
appears that the usual formulation is also the most efficient. Finally, we
compare the time-dependent HFB solutions with numerically exact solutions of
the two-particle Schrodinger equation. Depending on the treatment of the
initial state, the HFB dynamics produces a particle emission rate at short
times similar to that of the Schrodinger equation. At long times, the total
particle emission can be quite different, due to inherent mean-field
approximation of the HFB theory.

considerable attention, as the algorithmic detection of such structures makes
it possible to discover network features that are not apparent either at the

Numerous types of meso-scale structures can occur in networks, but
investigations of such features have focused predominantly on the
identification and study of community structure. In this paper, we develop a
new method to investigate the meso-scale feature known as core-periphery
structure, which entails identifying densely-connected core nodes and
sparsely-connected periphery nodes. In contrast to communities, the nodes in a
core are also reasonably well-connected to those in the periphery. Our new
method of computing core-periphery structure can identify multiple cores in a
network and takes different possible cores into account. We illustrate the
differences between our method and several existing methods for identifying
which nodes belong to a core, and we use our technique to examine
core-periphery structure in examples of friendship, collaboration,
transportation, and voting networks.

disease cases offer key information in guiding the direction to the in-depth
analysis. Models for growth and transmission dynamics are heavily dependent on
preliminary analysis results. When a particular disease case is reported more
than once or alternatively is never reported or detected in the population,
then in such a situation, there is a possibility of existence of multiple
reporting or under reporting in the population. In this work, a theoretical
approach for studying reporting error in epidemiology is explored. The upper
bound for the error that arises due to multiple reporting is higher than that
which arises due to under reporting. Numerical examples are provided to support
the arguments. This article mainly treats reporting error as deterministic and
one can explore a stochastic model for the same.

observations by the Suzaku and XMM-Newton satellites did not confirm this

flares and numerous absorption dips. These characteristics together with a
suspected 4.3 h orbital period would suggest a possible link with the so-
called ""dipping sources"", a sub-class of Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXB). Based
on the released FERMI catalogues, the source was also found coincident with a
very high energy (0.1-300 GeV) VHE source 2FGL J1227.7-4853. The good
positional coincidence, together with the lack of any other bright X-ray

various conformations of AT-containing decamers, (A5T5)2 and A10:T10, were
studied by Monte Carlo simulations. The duplexes were constrained to reproduce
the NMR inter-proton distances for the A-tracts at two temperatures: 5 and 35C.
Analysis of the water shell structures revealed a strong correlation between
the groove widths on the one hand, and the types of hydration patterns and
their probabilities on the other hand. Depending on the minor groove width, the
following patterns were observed in this groove: either an interstrand
""hydration spine"", or interstrand two-water bridges, or a double ribbon of
intrastrand sugar-base ""water strings"". Hydration shell in the major groove is
less regular than in the minor groove, which agrees with crystallographic data.
As in previous studies, energetically advantageous hydration is found for the
A-tract conformations with narrow minor groove and wide major groove (B'-like
DNA), known to be correlated with DNA bending and curvature. In addition, our
calculations indicate that the advantage of such DNA conformations is coupled
with the increase in adenine N7 hydration in the major groove. As the major
groove is opened wider, its hydration shell is enriched by energetically
favorable ""trident waters"" hydrogen bonded to three hydrophilic centers
belonging to two adjacent adenines: two N7 atoms and one amino-proton H(N6).
Based on these results, we suggest that formation of the novel hydration
pattern in the major groove is one of the factors responsible for stabilization
of the B'-like conformations of A-tracts at low temperature in the absense of
dehydrating agents, leading in turn to the strong intrinsic curvature of DNA
containing alternating A-tracts and ""mixed"" GC-rich sequences.

challenge for data mining and network analysis. In particular, the microscopic
organizing principles of directed networks are less understood than those of
undirected networks. This article proposes a hypothesis named potential theory,
which assumes that every directed link corresponds to a decrease of a unit
potential and subgraphs with definable potential values for all nodes are
preferred. Combining the potential theory with the clustering and homophily
mechanisms, it is deduced that the Bi-fan structure consisting of 4 nodes and 4
directed links is the most favored local structure in directed networks. Our
hypothesis receives strongly positive supports from extensive experiments on 15
directed networks drawn from disparate fields, as indicated by the most
accurate and robust performance of Bi-fan predictor within the link prediction
framework. In summary, our main contribution is twofold: (i) We propose a new
mechanism for the local organization of directed networks; (ii) We design the
corresponding link prediction algorithm, which can not only testify our
hypothesis, but also find out direct applications in missing link prediction
and friendship recommendation.

resort to its nonextensive version. The new parameter q appearing there is
directly connected to the variance of the particular variable X, q =
1+Var(X)/<X>^2 (with q = 1 for the usual statistical model). We shall
demonstrate here how such an approach allows us to compose fluctuations of
different observables (described by their respective parameters q) leading to a
characteristic sum rule connecting q's deduced from measurements of these
observables, which can be verified experimentally. We shall also discuss
ensembles in which all relevant quantities, namely the energy (U), temperature
(T) and multiplicity (N), can fluctuate. A specific relation connecting all
these fluctuating variables is proposed. It generalizes the so called Lindhard
thermodynamic uncertainty relations known in the literature, by introducing, in
a natural way, a possibility of correlations between the fluctuating variables
considered. This point is illustrated using an example from the multiparticle
production processes. We show that fluctuations from different parts of phase
space (characterized by different parameters q) are correlated and that the
strength of these correlations is a function of these q's, Cov(U,T) = F({q}).
These correlations can be tested experimentally. Some rough first estimates,

considers the complete covariant Lagrangian in four dimensions. This theory is
composed by a potential and a standard kinetic term, a cubic kinetic term and
two additional terms that include the coupling between the Galileon and the
metric, to preserve the original properties of Galileons also in curved
space-times. Here we extend previous studies, which considered both the
quintessence and the cubic terms, by focussing on the role of the last two
terms. The background evolution we consider is driven by a tracker solution.
Studying scalar perturbations in the non-linear regime, we find constraints on
the parameter of the model. We will show how the new terms contribute to the
collapse phase and how they modify physical parameters, such as the linearized
density contrast and the virial overdensity. The results show that the Galileon
modifies substantially the dynamics of the collapse, thus making it possible to
observationally constrain the parameters of this theory.

the ISM of galaxies and are responsible for much of the chemical enrichment of
the universe. The rate of supernovae can also reveal the star formation
histories. Supernova rates are usually measured through the non-thermal radio
continuum luminosity; however, a correlation between near-infrared [FeII]
emission and supernova remnants has also been noted. We aim to find a
quantitative relationship between the [FeII] at 1.26 um ([FeII]$_{1.26}$)
luminosity and supernova rate in a sample of 11 near-by starburst galaxy
centers. We perform a pixel-pixel analysis of this correlation on SINFONI data
cubes. Using Br$\gamma$ equivalent width and luminosity as the only
observational inputs into the Starburst 99 model, we derive the supernova rate
at each pixel and thus create maps of supernova rates. We then compare these
morphologically and quantitatively to the [FeII]$_{1.26}$ luminosity. We have
found that a strong linear and morphological correlation exists between
supernova rate and [FeII]$_{1.26}$ on a pixel-pixel basis:
  \[ log\frac{\nu_{SNrate}}{yr^{-1}pc^{-2}} = 1.01 \pm 0.2\ast
log\frac{[FeII]_{1.26}}{erg s^{-1}pc^{-2}} - 41.17 \pm 0.9\]
  This relation is valid for normal star forming galaxies but breaks down for
extreme ultra luminous galaxies. The supernova rates derived from the Starburst
99 model are in good agreement with the radio-derived supernova rates, which
underlines the strength of using [FeII] emission as a tracer of supernova rate.
With the strong correlation found in this sample of galaxies, we conclude that
[FeII]$_{1.26}$ emission can be generally used to derive accurate supernova
rates on either a pixel-pixel or integrated galactic basis.

construct a semi-empirical catalog (SEC) of early-type systems by making a
self-consistent bivariate statistical match of stellar mass (M_star) and
velocity dispersion (sigma) with halo virial mass (M_vir). We then assign
stellar mass profile and velocity dispersion profile parameters to each system
in the SEC using their observed correlations with M_star and sigma.
Simultaneously, we solve for dark matter density profile of each halo using the
spherical Jeans equation. The resulting dark matter density profiles deviate in
general from the dissipationless profile of NFW or Einasto and their mean inner
density slope and concentration vary systematically with M_vir. Statistical
tests of the distribution of profiles at fixed M_vir rule out the null
hypothesis that it follows the distribution predicted by N-body simulations for
M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar. These dark matter profiles imply that dark
matter density is, on average, enhanced significantly in the inner region of
halos with M_vir ~< 10^{13.5-14.5} M_solar supporting halo contraction. The
main characteristics of halo contraction are: (1) the mean dark matter density
within the effective radius has increased by a factor varying systematically up
to ~ 3-4 at M_vir = 10^{12} M_solar, and (2) the inner density slope has a mean
of <alpha> ~ 1.3 with rho(r) ~ r^{-alpha} and a halo-to-halo rms scatter of
rms(alpha) ~ 0.4-0.5 for 10^{12} M_solar ~< M_vir ~< 10^{13-14} M_solar steeper
than the NFW profile (alpha=1). Based on our results we predict that halos of
nearby elliptical and lenticular galaxies can, in principle, be promising
targets for gamma-ray emission from dark matter annihilation.

structure on a noncommutative algebra $A$ based on the Kontsevich principle.
His idea was to find the {\it weakest} possible structure on $A$ that induces
standard (commutative) Poisson structures on all representation spaces $
\Rep_V(A) $. It turns out that such a weak Poisson structure on $A$ is a Lie
algebra bracket on the 0-th cyclic homology $ \HC_0(A) $ satisfying some extra
conditions; it was thus called in an {\it $ H_0$-Poisson structure}.
  This paper studies a higher homological extension of this construction. In
our more general setting, we show that noncommutative Poisson structures in the
above sense behave nicely with respect to homotopy (in the sense that homotopy
equivalent NC Poisson structures on $A$ induce (via the derived representation
functor) homotopy equivalent Poisson algebra structures on the derved
representation schemes $\DRep_V(A) $). For an ordinary algebra $A$, a
noncommutative Poisson structure on a semifree (more generally, cofibrant)
resolution of $A$ yields a graded (super) Lie algebra structure on the full
cyclic homology $ \HC_\bullet(A) $ extending Crawley-Boevey's $\H_0$-Poisson
structure on $ \HC_0(A) $. We call such structures {\it derived Poisson
structures} on $A$.
  We also show that derived Poisson structures do arise in nature: the cobar
construction $\Omega(C)$ of an $(-n)$-cyclic coassociative DG coalgebra (in
particular, of the linear dual of a finite dimensional $n$-cyclic DG algebra)
$C$ carries a $(2-n)$-double Poisson bracket in the sense of Van den Bergh.
This in turn induces a corresponding noncommutative $(2-n)$-Poisson structure
on $\Omega(C)$. When (the semifree) DG algebra $\Omega(C)$ resolves an honest
algebra $A$, $A$ acquires a derived $(2-n)$-Poisson structure.

classical ground states as CCM model states we present results for their gs

states selected by quantum fluctuations at $O(1/s)$ in a large-$s$ analysis
(where $s$ is the spin quantum number) from the infinitely degenerate set of
AFM states that form the gs phase for the classical version of the model (for
$\kappa>1$) survives the quantum fluctuations to form a stable
magnetically-ordered gs phase for the spin-half case. The Neel state becomes
susceptible to PVBC ordering at or very near to $\kappa = \kappa_{c_1}$, and
the fourfold AFM states become infinitely susceptible to PVBC ordering at
$\kappa = \kappa_{c_2} \approx 1.22 \pm 0.02$. In turn, we find that these

the real world was stated by Born in 1926. Since then, there were many attempts
to derive the Born postulate as a theorem, Gleason's being the most prominent.
The Gleason derivation, however, is generally considered rather intricate and
its physical meaning, in particular in relation with the noncontextuality of
probability (NP), is not quite evident. More recently, we are witnessing a
revival of interest in possible demonstrations of the Born rule, like Zurek's
and Deutsch's based on the decoherence and on the theory of decisions,
respectively. Despite an ongoing debate about the presence of hidden
assumptions and circular reasonings, these have the merit of prompting more
physically oriented approaches to the problem. Here we suggest a new proof of
the Born rule based on the noncontextuality of probability. Within the theorem
we also demonstrate the continuity of probability with respect to the
amplitudes, which has been suggested to be a gap in Zurek's and Deutsch's
approaches, and we show that NP is implicitly postulated also in their
demonstrations. Finally, physical motivations of NP are given based on an
invariance principle with respect to a resolution change of measurements and
with respect to the principle of no-faster-than-light signalling.

We prove that adequately processing these excursions, the magnetic properties

that the quality of our estimates is frequency dependent. We also suggest that

target space $\cM$ as a single particle relativistic quantum mechanics in the
corresponding free loop space $\cLM$. In a natural semi-classical limit
($\hbar=\alpha' \to 0$) of this model the wavefunction localizes on the
submanifold of vanishing loops which is isomorphic to $\cM$. One would expect
that the relevant semi-classical expansion should be related to the tubular
expansion of the theory around the submanifold and an effective dynamics on the
submanifold is obtainable using Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In this work we
develop a framework to carry out such an analysis at the leading order in
$\alpha'$-expansion. In particular, we show that the linearized tachyon
effective equation is correctly reproduced up to divergent terms all
proportional to the Ricci scalar of $\cM$. The steps leading to this result are
as follows: first we define a finite dimensional analogue of the loop space
quantum mechanics (LSQM) where we discuss its tubular expansion and how that is
related to a semi-classical expansion of the Hamiltonian. Then we study an
explicit construction of the relevant tubular neighborhood in $\cLM$ using
exponential maps. Such a tubular geometry is obtained from a Riemannian
structure on the tangent bundle of $\cM$ which views the zero-section as a
submanifold admitting a tubular neighborhood. Using this result and exploiting
an analogy with the toy model we arrive at the final result for LSQM.

distinction in both wave-function and operators between particle and
antiparticle at the level of quantum mechanics (QM). Then it is proposed that
the CPT invariance in particle physics leads naturally to a basic postulate
that the (newly defined) space-time inversion (${\bf x}\to -{\bf x},t\to -t$)
is equivalent to the transformation between particle and its antiparticle. The
evolution of this postulate from nonrelativistic QM via relativistic QM till
the quantum field theory is discussed in some detail. The Klein paradox for
both Klein-Gordon equation and Dirac equation is also discussed.

have been detected in the direction of the Galactic globular cluster (GC)
Terzan 5. Remarkably, this is among the brightest GCs detected in the GeV
regime. The nature of both the TeV and the diffuse X-ray signal from Terzan 5
is not settled yet. These emissions most likely indicate the presence of
several non-thermal radiation processes in addition to these giving rise to the
GeV signal.
  The aim of this work is to search for diffuse X-ray emission from the GeV
detected GCs M 62, NGC 6388, NGC 6541, M 28, M 80 and NGC 6139 to compare the
obtained results with the signal detected from Terzan 5. This study will help
to determine whether Terzan 5 stands out amongst other GC or whether a whole
population of globular clusters feature similar properties.
  None of the six GCs show significant diffuse X-ray emission on similar scales
as observed from Terzan 5 above the particle and diffuse galactic X-ray
background components. The derived upper limits allow to assess the validity of
different models that were discussed in the interpretation of the
multi-wavelength data of Terzan 5. A scenario based on synchrotron emission
from relativistic leptons provided by the millisecond pulsar population can not
be securely rejected if a comparable magnetic field strength as in Terzan 5 is
assumed for every GC. However, such a scenario seems to be unlikely for NGC
6388 and M 62. An inverse-Compton scenario relying on the presence of a
putative GRB remnant with the same properties as the one proposed for Terzan 5
can be ruled out for all of the six GCs. Finally, the assumption that each GC
hosts a source with the same luminosity as in Terzan 5 is ruled out for all GCs
but NGC 6139. (abridged)

the star formation history of the host galaxy, by determining the age and
metallicity of the parent population. Aims. We investigate the pulsation
properties of 84 Anomalous Cepheids (ACs) detected by the OGLE-III survey in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), in order to understand the formation
mechanism and the characteristics of the parent population they came from.
Methods. We used an updated theoretical pulsation scenario to derive the mass
and the pulsation mode of each AC in the sample. We also used a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to analyze the spatial distribution of the ACs, in
comparison with that of other groups of variable stars, and connect their
properties with the star formation history of the LMC. Results. We find that
the mean mass of ACs is 1.2 \pm 0.2Mo. We show that ACs do not follow the same
spatial distribution of classical Cepheids. This and the difference in their
period-luminosity relations further support the hypothesis that ACs are not the
extension to low luminosity of classical Cepheids. The spatial distribution of
ACs is also different from that of bona-fide tracers of the old population,
such as RR Lyrae stars and population II Cepheids. We therefore suggest that
the majority of ACs in the LMC are made of intermediate-age (1-6Gyr),
metal-poor single stars. Finally, we investigate the relation between the
frequency of ACs and the luminosity of the host galaxy, disclosing that purely
old systems follow a very tight relation and that galaxies with strong
intermediate-age and young star formation tend to have an excess of ACs, in
agreement with their hosting ACs formed via both single and binary star
channels.

described by a set of state evolution equations. The proposed approach to

  abstract of this paper appeared in WAW 2012 under the title ""A Sublinear Time
  Algorithm for PageRank Computations""",,,,"cs.DS cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  A fundamental problem arising in many applications in Web science and social
network analysis is, given an arbitrary approximation factor $c>1$, to output a
set $S$ of nodes that with high probability contains all nodes of PageRank at
least $\Delta$, and no node of PageRank smaller than $\Delta/c$. We call this
problem {\sc SignificantPageRanks}. We develop a nearly optimal, local
algorithm for the problem with runtime complexity $\tilde{O}(n/\Delta)$ on
networks with $n$ nodes. We show that any algorithm for solving this problem
must have runtime of ${\Omega}(n/\Delta)$, rendering our algorithm optimal up
to logarithmic factors.
  Our algorithm comes with two main technical contributions. The first is a
multi-scale sampling scheme for a basic matrix problem that could be of
interest on its own. In the abstract matrix problem it is assumed that one can
access an unknown {\em right-stochastic matrix} by querying its rows, where the
cost of a query and the accuracy of the answers depend on a precision parameter
$\epsilon$. At a cost propositional to $1/\epsilon$, the query will return a
list of $O(1/\epsilon)$ entries and their indices that provide an
$\epsilon$-precision approximation of the row. Our task is to find a set that
contains all columns whose sum is at least $\Delta$, and omits any column whose
sum is less than $\Delta/c$. Our multi-scale sampling scheme solves this
problem with cost $\tilde{O}(n/\Delta)$, while traditional sampling algorithms
would take time $\Theta((n/\Delta)^2)$.
  Our second main technical contribution is a new local algorithm for
approximating personalized PageRank, which is more robust than the earlier ones
developed in \cite{JehW03,AndersenCL06} and is highly efficient particularly
for networks with large in-degrees or out-degrees. Together with our multiscale
sampling scheme we are able to optimally solve the {\sc SignificantPageRanks}
problem.

constrain the anti-neutrino atmospheric mixing angle >0.75 (90%CL). These
values are in agreement with those measured for muon neutrinos, removing the

  Valencia, Spain",,,,"cs.AI cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Achieving joint objectives by teams of cooperative planning agents requires
significant coordination and communication efforts. For a single-agent system
facing a plan failure in a dynamic environment, arguably, attempts to repair
the failed plan in general do not straightforwardly bring any benefit in terms
of time complexity. However, in multi-agent settings the communication
complexity might be of a much higher importance, possibly a high communication
overhead might be even prohibitive in certain domains. We hypothesize that in
decentralized systems, where coordination is enforced to achieve joint
objectives, attempts to repair failed multi-agent plans should lead to lower
communication overhead than replanning from scratch.
  The contribution of the presented paper is threefold. Firstly, we formally
introduce the multi-agent plan repair problem and formally present the core
hypothesis underlying our work. Secondly, we propose three algorithms for
multi-agent plan repair reducing the problem to specialized instances of the
multi-agent planning problem. Finally, we present results of experimental
validation confirming the core hypothesis of the paper.

degree up to $k$ if and only if its mask satisfies sum rules of order $k+1$, or
its symbol satisfies zero conditions of order $k+1$. This property is often
called the polynomial reproduction property of the subdivision scheme. It is a
well-known fact that this property is, in general, only necessary for the
associated refinable function to have approximation order $k+1$.
  In this paper we study a different polynomial reproduction property of
multivariate scalar subdivision scheme with dilation matrix $mI$, $|m| \ge 2$.
Namely, we are interested in capability of a subdivision scheme to reproduce in
the limit exactly the same polynomials from which the data is sampled. The
motivation for this paper are the results by Adi Levin that state that such a
reproduction property of degree $k$ of the subdivision scheme is sufficient for
having approximation order $k+1$.
  Our main result yields simple algebraic conditions on the subdivision symbol
for computing the exact degree of such polynomial reproduction and also for
determining the associated parametrization. The parametrization determines the
grid points to which the newly computed values are attached at each subdivision
iteration to ensure the higher degree of polynomial reproduction. We illustrate
our results with several examples.
