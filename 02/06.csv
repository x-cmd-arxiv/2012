feedback on the fluctuations of the total entropy production and show that the
explicit expression of the detailed fluctuation theorem involves different

pre-coded against the interference experienced at the cognitive decoder. The
pre-coding of the cognitive message does not allow the primary decoder to
reconstruct the interfering signal. The cognitive message acts instead as a

starts during the main-sequence stage and produces $^{12}{\rm C}$, leading to
the activation of a part of the CNO-cycle. It was found that, despite of that,
those stars with $M\lesssim 13\Mo$ become unstable against the dipole g$_1$-
and g$_2$-modes due to the $\varepsilon$-mechanism, during the early
evolutionary phase at which the pp-chain is still the dominant nuclear energy
source. The instability due to the $\varepsilon$-mechanism occurs against
g-modes having a large amplitude in the off-centered $^3$He accumulation shell
in the deep interior, and the growth time is much shorter than the evolutionary
timescale. This instability is therefore likely to induce mixing in the stellar
interior, and have a significant influence on the evolution of these stars.

fitting procedure from rest-frame UV to mid-IR and direct 160$\mu$m
observations taken with the Photodetector Array Camera & Spectrometer (PACS)
instrument onboard \emph{Herschel Space Observatory}. We define LAEs as those
Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies whose rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths
(Ly$\alpha$ EW$_{rest-frame}$) are above 20\AA, the typical threshold in
narrow-band searches. Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies with Ly$\alpha$
EW$_{rest-frame}$ are called non-LAEs. As a result of an individual SED fitting
for each object, we find that the studied sample of LAEs contains galaxies with
ages mostly below 100Myr and a wide variety of dust attenuations, SFRs, and
stellar masses. The heterogeneity in the physical properties is also seen in
the morphology, ranging from bulge-like galaxies to highly clumpy systems. In
this way, we find that LAEs at 2.0$\lesssim$z$\lesssim$3.5 are very diverse,
and do not have a bimodal nature, as suggested in previous works. Furthermore,
the main difference between LAEs and non-LAEs is their dust attenuation,
because LAEs are not as dusty as non-LAEs. On the FIR side, four galaxies of
the sample (two LAEs and two non-LAEs) have PACS-FIR counterparts. Their total
IR luminosity place all of them in the ULIRG regime and are all dusty objects,
with A$_{1200}$$\gtrsim$4mag. This is an indication from direct FIR
measurements that dust and Ly$\alpha$ emission are not mutually exclusive. This
population of red and dusty LAEs is not seen at z$\sim$0.3, suggesting an
evolution with redshift of the IR nature of galaxies selected via their
Ly$\alpha$ emission.

biologically motivated by passive protein transport across membranes. The

one of the alkyl groups is methyl for all RTILs, and the other group is
different for each RTILs, being ethyl (EMIM), butyl (BMIM), hexyl (HMIM), octyl

ionic cluster distributions, heats of vaporization, diffusion constants, shear
viscosities, ionic conductivities, and their correlations are discussed. Upon
addition of ACN, the ionic conductivity of RTILs is found to increase by more
than 50 times, that significantly exceeds an impact of most known solvents.
Remarkably, the sharpest conductivity growth is found for the long-tailed
imidazolium-based cations. This new fact motivates to revisit an application of
these binary systems as advanced electrolytes. The ionic conductivity
correlates generally with a composition of ionic clusters, simplifying its
predictability. In turn, the addition of ACN exponentially increases diffusion
and decreases viscosity of the imidazolium-based RTILs/ACN mixtures. Large
amounts of acetonitrile stabilize ion pairs, but ruin greater ionic clusters.

for universal quantum computation on 2D Kitaev code. It is shown that the
encoding scheme is equivalent to teleporting the state, from a specific node

the class $\bar{\mathscr H}_2(X, Y)$ of strong limits of homeomorphisms in the
Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(X, Y)$, a result of considerable interest in the
mathematical models of Nonlinear Elasticity. The inner variation leads to the
Hopf differential $h_z \bar{h_{\bar{z}}} dz \otimes dz$ and its trajectories.
For a pair of doubly connected domains, in which $X$ has finite conformal
modulus, we establish the following principle:
  A mapping $h \in \bar{\mathscr H}_2(X, Y)$ is energy-minimal if and only if
its Hopf-differential is analytic in $X$ and real along the boundary of $X$.
  In general, the energy-minimal mappings may not be injective, in which case
one observes the occurrence of cracks in $X$. Nevertheless, cracks are
triggered only by the points in the boundary of $Y$ where $Y$ fails to be
convex. The general law of formation of cracks reads as follows:
  Cracks propagate along vertical trajectories of the Hopf differential from
the boundary of $X$ toward the interior of $X$ where they eventually terminate

an observer-independent mechanism by which apparently classical systems

generate classical systems if the ""environment"" is assumed \textit{a priori} to

is then reformulated in terms of positive operator-valued measures (POVMs)
acting on a global quantum state. It is shown that this re-formulation enables
a natural interpretation of apparently-classical systems as virtual machines

previously simulated observations in order to constrain dynamo models of the

instrument on the Perkins Telescope in Flagstaff, AZ, along a line of constant
Galactic longitude (\ell = 150\circ) with 17 pointings of the 10' \times 10'
field of view between -75\circ < b < 10\circ, with more frequent pointings
towards the Galactic midplane. A total of 10,962 stars were photometrically
measured and 1,116 had usable polarizations. The observed distribution of
polarization position angles with Galactic latitude and the cumulative
distribution function of the measured polarizations are compared to predicted
values. While the predictions lack the effects of turbulence and are therefore
idealized, this comparison allows significant rejection of A0-type magnetic
field models. S0 and disk-even halo-odd magnetic field geometries are also
rejected by the observations, but at lower significance. New predictions of
spiral-type, axisymmetric magnetic fields, when combined with these new NIR
observations, constrain the Galactic magnetic field spiral pitch angle to
-6\circ \pm 2\circ.

parameter $A_s$. We are able to successfully fit all three data sets, including
the MiniBooNE low energy excess, with the following best-fit model parameters:
$\Delta m^2=0.47$ eV$^2$, $\sin^22\theta_{\mu e}=0.010$, and
$A_s=2.0\times10^{-10}$ eV. The $\chi^2$-probability for the best fit

region appeared in NOAA Active Region 11039. We found an annular zone (width
3""-5"") surrounding the umbra (pore) in Ca II H images before the penumbra is
formed around the umbra. The penumbra was developed as if to fill the annular
zone. The annular zone shows weak magnetogram signals, meaning less magnetic
flux or highly inclined fields there. Pre-existing ambient magnetic field
islands were moved to be distributed at the outer edge of the annular zone and
did not come into the zone. There is no strong systematic flow patterns in the
zone, but we occasionally observed small magnetic flux patches streaming out.
The observations indicate that the annular zone is different from sunspot moat
flow region and that it represents the structure in the chromosphere. We
conclude that the annular zone reflects the formation of a magnetic canopy
overlying the region surrounding the umbra at the chromospheric level, much
before the formation of the penumbra at the photospheric level. The magnetic
field structure in the chromosphere needs to be considered in the formation
process of the penumbrae.

systemic velocities of the parent galaxies from which they emanate increase
almost monotonically with the distance from the nucleus of the respective

The one-sided morphologies and the velocity fields of the EIGs are consistent

found a very low-velocity filament (v_rel = -1300 km/s) at the southeastern
edge of the disk of IC4040. Some bright compact knots in the EIGs of RB199 and

widths of the H-alpha emission exceed 200 A, and are greater than 1000 A for
some knots. The emission line intensity ratios of the knots are basically
consistent with those of sub-solar abundance HII regions. These facts indicate
that intensive star formation occurs in the knots. Some filaments, including
the low velocity filament of the IC4040 EIG, exhibit shock-like emission line
spectra, suggesting that shock heating plays an important role in ionization

role in the context of polynomial time folding of RNA pseudoknot structures. A
$\gamma$-structure is composed by specific building blocks, that have
topological genus less than or equal to $\gamma$, where composition means
concatenation and nesting of such blocks. Our main results are the derivation
of a new bivariate generating function for $\gamma$-structures via symbolic
methods, the singularity analysis of the solutions and a central limit theorem
for the distribution of topological genus in $\gamma$-structures of given
length. In our derivation specific bivariate polynomials play a central role.
Their coefficients count particular motifs of fixed topological genus and they
are of relevance in the context of genus recursion and novel folding
algorithms.

superconducting states induced by the antiferromagnetic fluctuations for
iron-vacancy-ordered A$_{y}$Fe$_{2-x}$Se$_{2}$. It is shown that due to the
broken reflection symmetry induced by the iron vacancies, new superconducting
states with $C_{4h}$ symmetry emerge. In particular, we show that in the
$C_{4h}$ symmetry, symmetric axes of the pairing momenta do not need to
coincide with axes of the unit cell. As a result, in addition to the magnitude
of the pairing gap, the relative orientation of the pairing wave function to
the lattice forms another degree of freedom for characterizing the
superconducting gap and can further help in gaining the condensation energy.
Nonetheless, similar to other iron-based superconductors, the singlet ground
state is still dominated by s-wave or d-wave, which are nearly degenerate with
anisotropic gaps. Furthermore, s-wave and d-wave superconducting states are
separated by a quantum critical point controlled by the Hund's rule coupling
$J_{H}$.

galaxies is expected to produce unique emission line signatures, which have not
yet been explored adequately. Here we report the discovery of extremely strong
coronal lines from [Fe X] up to [Fe XIV] in a sample of seven galaxies
(including two recently reported cases), that we interpret as such signatures.
This is the first systematic search for objects of this kind, by making use of
the immense database of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The galaxies, which are
non-active as evidenced by the narrow-line ratios, show broad emission lines of
complex profiles in more than half of the sample. Both the high ionization
coronal lines and the broad lines turn out to be fading on time scales of years
in objects observed with spectroscopic follow-ups, suggesting their transient
nature. Variations of inferred non-stellar continua, which have absolute
magnitudes of at least -16 to -18 mag in the g band, are also detected in more
than half of the sample. These extreme coronal line emitters reside in sub-L_*
disk galaxies (-21.3 < M_i < -18.5) with small stellar velocity dispersions.
The sample seems to form two distinct types based on the presence or absence of
the [Fe VII] lines, with the latter having relatively low luminosities of [O
III], [Fe XI], and the host galaxies. These characteristics can most naturally
be understood in the context of transient accretion onto intermediate mass
black holes at galactic centers following tidal disruption of stars in a
gas-rich environment. We estimate the incidence of such events to be around
10^-5 per year for a galaxy with -21.5 < M_i < -18.5.

$\te_-$. Contrary to other studies, we consider the temperatures that are

obtain, both numerically and analytically, the dependence of $D_c$ on the

when $\te$ ranges between $\te_-$ and $\te_+$, the diffusion coefficient
behaves as a sum of two hyperbolas, $D_c \approx A/N|\te - \te_-| + B/N|\te -

down when the system gets from the two-phase regime to either of the

approaches a finite value. The crossover behavior of $D_c$ between the

original form and position have been modified. We used an astrometric method to
recover the original position of the pinhole: reshaping the pinhole to a circle
of 1.5 cm of diameter, the positions of the Northern and Southern limbs have
been compared with the ephemerides. A sistematic shift of 4.5 mm Southward of
the whole solar image shows that the original pinhole was 4.5 mm North of the
actual position, as the images in the Bianchini's book (1703) suggest. The oval
shape of the actual pinhole is also wrong. Using a circle the larger solar
spots are clearly visible. Some reference stars of the catalogue of Philippe de

four of them are wrongly located. Finally the deviation from the true North, of

extend the classical theory in order to be able to encompass also nonlinear

mechanical systems close to equilibrium, i.e. whose unperturbed state can be
described by a canonical ensemble, the theory of dispersion relations, and the
response theory recently developed by Ruelle for non-equilibrium systems
equipped with an invariant SRB measure. Our derivations highlight the strong
link between causality and the possibility of connecting unambiguously
fluctuation and response, both at linear and nonlinear level. We first show in
a rather general setting how the formalism of the Ruelle response theory can be
used to derive in a novel way Kramers-Kronig relations connecting the real and
imaginary part of the linear and nonlinear response to external perturbations.
We then provide a formal extension at each order of nonlinearity of the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) for general systems possessing a smooth
invariant measure. Finally, we focus on the physically relevant case of systems
close to equilibrium, for which we present explicit fluctuation-dissipation
relations linking the susceptibility describing the $n^{th}$ order response of
the system with the expectation value of suitably defined correlations of $n+1$
observables taken in the equilibrium ensemble. While the FDT has an especially
compact structure in the linear case, in the nonlinear case joining the
statistical properties of the fluctuations of the system to its response to
external perturbations requires linear changes of variables, simple algebraic
sums and multiplications, and a multiple convolution integral. These
operations, albeit cumbersome, can be easily implemented numerically.

probability of correct optimal decoding than the corresponding regular simplex
signal set, when compared at small values of the signal-to-noise ratio. The
latter was defined as the quotient of average signal energy and average noise
power. In this paper, it is shown that this interpretation of the
signal-to-noise ratio is inappropriate for a comparison of signal sets, since
it leads to a contradiction with the Channel Coding Theorem. A modified
counterexample signal set is proposed and examined using the classical
interpretation of the signal-to-noise ratio, i.e., as the quotient of average
signal energy and average noise energy. This signal set outperforms the regular
simplex signal set for small signal-to-noise ratios without contradicting the
Channel Coding Theorem, hence the Strong Simplex Conjecture remains proven
false.

using the interval consensus algorithm proposed by B\' en\' ezit, Thiran and
Vetterli (2009). In the binary consensus problem, each node initially holds one
of two states and the goal for each node is to correctly decide which one of
these two states was initially held by a majority of nodes.
  We derive an upper bound on the expected convergence time that holds for
arbitrary connected graphs, which is based on the location of eigenvalues of
some contact rate matrices. We instantiate our bound for particular networks of
interest, including complete graphs, paths, cycles, star-shaped networks, and
Erd\"" os-R\' enyi random graphs; for these graphs, we compare our bound with
alternative computations. We find that for all these examples our bound is
tight, yielding the exact order with respect to the number of nodes.
  We pinpoint the fact that the expected convergence time critically depends on
the voting margin defined as the difference between the fraction of nodes that
initially held the majority and the minority states, respectively. The
characterization of the expected convergence time yields exact relation between
the expected convergence time and the voting margin, for some of these graphs,
which reveals how the expected convergence time goes to infinity as the voting
margin approaches zero.
  Our results provide insights into how the expected convergence time depends
on the network topology which can be used for performance evaluation and
network design. The results are of interest in the context of networked
systems, in particular, peer-to-peer networks, sensor networks and distributed
databases.

the context of the phase space geometry, including the indirect influence of

electrons in an infinite volume --- is inadequate to model the UEGs that arise
in finite systems. We argue that, in general, a UEG is characterized by at
least two parameters, \textit{viz.} the usual one-electron density parameter
$\rho$ and a new two-electron parameter $\eta$. We outline a systematic
strategy to determine a new density functional $E(\rho,\eta)$ across the

gas caused by suppression of the interference quantum correction in HgTe single
quantum well heterostructure with the inverted energy spectrum are presented.
It is shown that only the antilocalization magnetoconductivity is observed at
the relatively high conductivity $\sigma>(20-30)G_0$, where $G_0=
e^2/2\pi^2\hbar$. The antilocalization correction demonstrates a crossover from
$0.5\ln{(\tau_\phi/\tau)}$ to $1.0\ln{(\tau_\phi/\tau)}$ behavior with the
increasing conductivity or decreasing temperature (here $\tau_\phi$ and $\tau$
are the phase relaxation and transport relaxation times, respectively). It is
interpreted as a result of crossover to the regime when the two chiral branches
of the electron energy spectrum contribute to the weak antilocalization
independently. At lower conductivity $\sigma<(20-30)G_0$, the
magnetoconductivity behaves itself analogously to that in usual 2D systems with
the fast spin relaxation: being negative in low magnetic field it becomes
positive in higher one. We have found that the temperature dependences of the
fitting parameter $\tau_\phi$ corresponding to the phase relaxation time
demonstrate reasonable behavior, close to 1/T, over the whole conductivity
range from $5G_0$ up to $130G_0$. However, the $\tau_\phi$ value remains
practically independent of the conductivity in distinction to the conventional
2D systems with the simple energy spectrum, in which $\tau_\phi$ is enhanced
with the conductivity.

projected radial distribution is found to be bimodal, with a high central peak,
a well defined minimum at intermediate radii (r \sim 40""), and an upturn in the
outskirts. From detailed star counts even in the very inner region, we compute
the centre of gravity of the cluster and the most accurate and extended radial
density profile ever published for this system. The profile is reasonably well
reproduced by a standard King model with an extended core (rc \simeq 9.5"") and
a modest value of the concentration parameter (c \simeq 1.49). However, a
deviation from the model is noted in the most external region of the cluster
(at r > 250"" from the centre). This feature needs to be further investigated in
order to assess the possible presence of a tidal tail in this cluster.

reasonable parameters (the magnetic inclination angle \alpha = 45 deg and the

self-consistently calculate radio, X-ray, gamma-ray and TeV (MAGIC and VERITAS)
light curves, phase-averaged spectrum and phase-resolved spectra for the Crab
pulsar. It is found that the acceleration electric field and potential in the
annular gap and core gap are huge enough in the several tens of neutron star
radii. The pulsed emission of radio, X-ray, gamma-ray and TeV are mainly
generated from the emission of primary particles or secondary particles with
different emission mechanisms in the nearly similar region of the annular gap
located in the only one magnetic pole, which leads to the nearly
""phase-aligned"" multi-wavelength light curves. The emission of peak 1 (P1) and
peak 2 (P2) is originated from the annular gap region near the null charge
surface, while the emission of bridge is mainly originated from the core gap
region. The phase-averaged spectrum and phase-resolved spectra of the Crab
pulsar from soft X-ray to TeV band are produced by four components: synchrotron
radiation from CR-induced and ICS-induced pairs dominates the X-ray band to
soft gamma-ray band (100 eV to 10 MeV); curvature radiation and synchrotron
radiation from the primary particles mainly contribute to gamma-ray band (10
MeV to \sim 20 GeV); ICS from the pairs significantly contributes to the TeV
gamma-ray band (\sim 20 GeV to 400 GeV). The multi-wavelength pulsed emission
from the Crab pulsar has been well modeled with the annular gap and core gap
model. To distinguish our single magnetic pole model from two-pole models, the
convincing values of the magnetic inclination angle and the viewing angle will
play a key role.

that weak classicalization may actually be equivalent to asymptotic safety,

The chromospheric layer observable with the He I 10830 {\AA} triplet
is strongly warped. The analysis of the magnetic morphology of this layer
therefore requires a reliable technique to determine the height at which the He
I absorption takes place.
  Aims. The He I absorption signature connecting two pores of opposite polarity
in an emerging flux region is investigated. This signature is suggestive of a
loop system connecting the two pores. We aim to show that limits can be set on
the height of this chromospheric loop system.
  Methods. The increasing anisotropy in the illumination of a thin, magnetic
structure intensifies the linear polarization signal observed in the He I
triplet with height. This signal is altered by the Hanle effect. We apply an
inversion technique incorporating the joint action of the Hanle and Zeeman
effects, with the absorption layer height being one of the free parameters.
  Results. The observed linear polarization signal can be explained only if the
loop apex is higher than \approx5 Mm. Best agreement with the observations is
achieved for a height of 6.3 Mm.
  Conclusions. The strength of the linear polarization signal in the loop apex
is inconsistent with the assumption of a He I absorption layer at a constant
height level. The determined height supports the earlier conclusion that dark
He 10830 {\AA} filaments in emerging flux regions trace emerging loops.

found to be spectroscopic binary candidates and four stars have very low
metallicity where two show about solar C abundance. Six of the 10 stars located
in the Delta Sct instability region of the HR-diagram show both Delta Sct and
Gamma Dor-type oscillations in their light curves implying that Gamma Dor-like
oscillations are much more common among the Delta Sct stars than predicted by
theory. Moreover, seven stars showing periods in the Delta Sct and the Delta
Sct-Gamma Dor range in their light curves are located in the HR-diagram left of
the blue edge of the theoretical Delta Sct instability strip. The consistency
of these findings with recent investigations based on high-quality Kepler data

one-dimensional singular potential given in the form of the derivative of
Dirac's delta function, $\lambda \delta'(x) $, with $\lambda \in \R$, being a
potential strength constant, has been discussed by several authors. The
transmission occurs at certain discrete values of $\lambda$ forming a resonance
set ${\lambda_n}_{n=1}^\infty$. For $\lambda \notin {\lambda_n}_{n=1}^\infty$
this potential has been shown to be a perfectly reflecting wall. However, this
resonant transmission takes place only in the case when the regularization of
the distribution $\delta'(x) $ is constructed in a specific way. Otherwise, the
$\delta'$-potential is fully non-transparent. Moreover, when the transmission
is non-zero, the structure of a resonant set depends on a regularizing sequence
$\Delta'_\varepsilon(x)$ that tends to $\delta'(x)$ in the sense of
distributions as $\varepsilon \to 0$. Therefore, from a practical point of
view, it would be interesting to have an inverse solution, i.e. for a given
$\bar{\lambda} \in \R$ to construct such a regularizing sequence
$\Delta'_\varepsilon(x)$ that the $\delta'$-potential at this value is
transparent. If such a procedure is possible, then this value $\bar{\lambda}$
has to belong to a corresponding resonance set. The present paper is devoted to
solving this problem and, as a result, the family of regularizing sequences is
constructed by tuning adjustable parameters in the equations that provide a
resonance transmission across the $\delta'$-potential.

the case where the compressible vector is distributed according to a general

is a special case. We use the derived bounds to uncover the relationship
between the compressibility and Mean Square Error (MSE) in the estimates.
Further, we illustrate the tightness and utility of the bounds through

Telescope, has a spin period of 2.38 ms, is relatively nearby (d <~ 2 kpc), and
is in a 1.48 day orbit around a low mass companion, probably a He-type white
dwarf. Pulsed gamma-ray emission was detected in the data recorded by the Fermi
LAT. The gamma-ray light curve and spectral properties are typical of other
gamma-ray millisecond pulsars seen with Fermi. X-ray observations of the pulsar
with Suzaku and the Swift/XRT yielded no detection. At 1.4 GHz we observe
strong flux density variations because of interstellar diffractive
scintillation, however a sharp peak can be observed at this frequency during
bright scintillation states. At 327 MHz the pulsar is detected with a much
higher signal-to-noise ratio and its flux density is far more steady. However,
at that frequency the Arecibo instrumentation cannot yet fully resolve the
pulse profile. Despite that, our pulse time-of-arrival measurements have a
post-fit residual rms of 2 \mus. This and the expected stability of this system
has made PSR J2043+1711 one of the first new Fermi-selected millisecond pulsars
to be added to pulsar gravitational wave timing arrays. It has also allowed a
significant measurement of relativistic delays in the times of arrival of the
pulses due to the curvature of space-time near the companion, but not yet with
enough precision to derive useful masses for the pulsar and the companion. A
mass for the pulsar between 1.7 and 2.0 solar masses can be derived if a
standard millisecond pulsar formation model is assumed. In this article we also
present a comprehensive summary of pulsar searches in Fermi LAT sources with

hyperbolic equations with non-smooth oefficients, using the Colombeau theory of
generalized functions. As a model problem, we study the Cauchy problem for the
one-dimensional wave equation with a discontinuous coefficient depending on
time. After demonstrating the existence and uniqueness of generalized solutions
in the sense of Colombeau to the problem, we investigate the phenomenon of
propagation of singularities, arising from delta function initial data, for the
case of a piecewise constant coefficient. We also provide an analysis of the
interplay between singularity strength and propagation effects. Finally, we
show that in case the initial data are distributions, the Colombeau solution to
the model problem is associated with the piecewise distributional solution of
the corresponding transmission problem.

The offset change is < 50 percent. Provided that optical light in the rest
frame traces the stellar mass of galaxies, the universal relation demonstrates
that the stellar mass was built up in galaxies over their cosmic histories in a
similar manner on average irrelevant to galaxy mass. The small offset in each
stellar mass bin from the universal relation shows weak size evolution at a

less massive galaxies (Mstar < 10^10 Msun) from z~3 to z~1, while the sizes

constraints imposed by the restricted isometry property (RIP) of the sensing
matrix plays a crucial role in the studies of many compressive sensing (CS)
problems. Assuming that (i) u and v are two sparse vectors separated by an
angle thetha, and (ii) the sensing matrix Phi satisfies RIP, this paper is
aimed at analytically characterizing the achievable angles between Phi*u and
Phi*v. Motivated by geometric interpretations of RIP and with the aid of the
well-known law of cosines, we propose a plane geometry based formulation for
the study of the considered problem. It is shown that all the RIP-induced
norm/distance constraints on Phi*u and Phi*v can be jointly depicted via a
simple geometric diagram in the two-dimensional plane. This allows for a joint
analysis of all the considered algebraic constraints from a geometric
perspective. By conducting plane geometry analyses based on the constructed
diagram, closed-form formulae for the maximal and minimal achievable angles are
derived. Computer simulations confirm that the proposed solution is tighter
than an existing algebraic-based estimate derived using the polarization
identity. The obtained results are used to derive a tighter restricted isometry
constant of structured sensing matrices of a certain kind, to wit, those in the
form of a product of an orthogonal projection matrix and a random sensing
matrix. Follow-up applications to three CS problems, namely, compressed-domain
interference cancellation, RIP-based analysis of the orthogonal matching
pursuit algorithm, and the study of democratic nature of random sensing
matrices are investigated.

then often considered static. More often than not, the aggregation time window
is dictated by the availability of data, and the effects of its length on the
resulting networks are rarely considered. Here, we address this question by
studying the structural features of networks emerging from aggregating
empirical data over different time intervals, focussing on networks derived
from time-stamped, anonymized mobile telephone call records. Our results show
that short aggregation intervals yield networks where strong links associated
with dense clusters dominate; the seeds of such clusters or communities become
already visible for intervals of around one week. The degree and weight
distributions are seen to become stationary around a few days and a few weeks,
respectively. An aggregation interval of around 30 days results in the stablest
similar networks when consecutive windows are compared. For longer intervals,
the effects of weak or random links become increasingly stronger, and the
average degree of the network keeps growing even for intervals up to 180 days.
The placement of the time window is also seen to affect the outcome: for short
windows, different behavioural patterns play a role during weekends and
weekdays, and for longer windows it is seen that networks aggregated during
holiday periods are significantly different.

is said to be a dynamic monopoly corresponding to $(G, \tau)$ if the vertices
of $G$ can be partitioned into subsets $D_0, D_1,..., D_k$ such that $D_0=D$
and for any $i\in {0, ..., k-1}$, each vertex $v$ in $D_{i+1}$ has at least
$\tau(v)$ neighbors in $D_0\cup ... \cup D_i$. Dynamic monopolies are in fact
modeling the irreversible spread of influence in social networks. In this paper
we first obtain a lower bound for the smallest size of any dynamic monopoly in
terms of the average threshold and the order of graph. Also we obtain an upper
bound in terms of the minimum vertex cover of graphs. Then we derive the upper
bound $|G|/2$ for the smallest size of any dynamic monopoly when the graph $G$
contains at least one odd vertex, where the threshold of any vertex $v$ is set
as $\lceil (deg(v)+1)/2 \rceil$ (i.e. strict majority threshold). This bound
improves the best known bound for strict majority threshold. We show that the
latter bound can be achieved by a polynomial time algorithm. We also show that
$\alpha'(G)+1$ is an upper bound for the size of strict majority dynamic
monopoly, where $\alpha'(G)$ stands for the matching number of $G$. Finally, we
obtain a basic upper bound for the smallest size of any dynamic monopoly, in
terms of the average threshold and vertex degrees. Using this bound we derive

finite-temperature spin-glass transition if the exponent that describes the
decay of the interaction degree in the scale-free graph is strictly larger than
3. However, when the exponent is equal to or less than 3, a spin-glass phase is
stable for all temperatures. The robustness of both the ferromagnetic and
spin-glass phases suggests that Boolean decision problems on scale-free
networks are quite stable to local perturbations. Finally, we show that for a

for the mean-field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising spin glass.

walk (GRW) and maximal entropy random walk (MERW) on two model networks: Cayley
trees and ladder graphs. The stationary probability distribution for MERW is
given by the squared components of the eigenvector associated with the largest
eigenvalue \lambda_0 of the adjacency matrix of a graph, while the dynamics of
the probability distribution approaching to the stationary state depends on the
second largest eigenvalue \lambda_1.
  Firstly, we give analytic solutions for Cayley trees with arbitrary branching
number, root degree, and number of generations. We determine three regimes of a
tree structure that result in different statics and dynamics of MERW, which are
due to strongly, critically, and weakly branched roots. We show how the
relaxation times, generically shorter for MERW than for GRW, scale with the
graph size.
  Secondly, we give numerical results for ladder graphs with symmetric defects.
MERW shows a clear exponential growth of the relaxation time with the size of
defective regions, which indicates trapping of a particle within highly
entropic intact region and its escaping that resembles quantum tunneling
through a potential barrier. GRW shows standard diffusive dependence
irrespective of the defects.

the envelope of the red giant branch star progenitor of the extreme horizontal
branch (EHB) star KIC 05807616. The released gravitational energy unbound most
of the stellar envelope, turning it into an EHB star. The massive planet
reached the tidal destruction radius of ~Ro from the core, where the planet's
gaseous envelope was tidally removed. In our scenario the metallic core of the
massive planet was tidally destructed into several Earth-like bodies
immediately after the gaseous envelope of the planet was removed. Two, and
possibly more, Earth-size fragments survived at orbital separations of >Ro
within the gaseous disk. The bodies interact with the disk and among themselves
and migrated to reach orbits close to a 3:2 resonance. These observed planets
can have a planetary magnetic field about ten times as strong as that of Earth.
This strong magnetic field can substantially reduce the evaporation rate from
the planets and explain their survivability against the strong UV radiation of
the EHB star.

integer programming problem, the solution of which shows the optimal assignment
(in the sense of minimizing the total energy consumption) between base stations

switched off or put in idle mode to save energy. However, solving this problem

objective function is concave and the constraint set is convex. The resulting
relaxed problem is still intractable in general, but we can apply the

structure, its spin-orientation adapts constantly, thereby inducing forces that
act on both the magnetic structure and the electron. These forces may be
described by electric and magnetic fields of an emergent electrodynamics. The
topologically quantized winding number of so-called skyrmions, i.e., certain
magnetic whirls, discovered recently in chiral magnets are theoretically
predicted to induce exactly one quantum of emergent magnetic flux per skyrmion.
A moving skyrmion is therefore expected to induce an emergent electric field
following Faraday's law of induction, which inherits this topological
quantization. Here we report Hall effect measurements, which establish
quantitatively the predicted emergent electrodynamics. This allows to obtain
quantitative evidence of the depinning of skyrmions from impurities at
ultra-low current densities of only 10^6 A/m^2 and their subsequent motion. The
combination of exceptionally small current densities and simple transport
measurements offers fundamental insights into the connection between emergent
and real electrodynamics of skyrmions in chiral magnets, and promises to be
important for applications in the long-term.

analytic versal unfoldings of the generic Hopf-Zero singularity in an open set
of the parameter space. This heteroclinic orbit appears at any order if one
performs the normal form around the origin, therefore it is a phenomenon
""beyond all orders"". In this paper we provide a formula for the distance
between the corresponding stable and unstable one dimensional manifolds which
is given by an exponentially small function in the perturbation parameter. Our
result applies both for conservative and dissipative unfoldings.

including the Fourier matrix? We address this problem with a power series
expansion. Studying all dimensions up to 100 we find that the first order
result is misleading unless the dimension is 6, or a power of a prime. In
general the answer depends critically on the prime number decomposition of the
dimension. Our results suggest that a general theory is possible. We discuss
the case of dimension 12 in detail, and argue that the solution consists of two
13-dimensional families intersecting in a previously known 9-dimensional
family. A precise conjecture for all dimensions equal to a prime times another
prime squared is formulated.

They are usually
attributed in the literature to periodical phenomena in the source (e.g.,
precession). In this work, we use VLBI data of the radio-jet in the quasar S5
0836+710 and hypothesize that the ridge-line of helical jets like this
corresponds to a pressure maximum in the jet and assume that the helically
twisted pressure maximum is the result of a helical wave pattern. For our
study, we use observations of the jet in S5 0836+710 at different frequencies
and epochs. The results show that the structures observed are physical and not
generated artificially by the observing arrays. Our hypothesis that the
observed intensity ridge-line can correspond to a helically twisted pressure
maximum is confirmed by our observational tests. This interpretation allows us
to explain jet misalignment between parsec and kiloparsec scales when the
viewing angle is small, and also brings us to the conclusion that
high-frequency observations may show only a small region of the jet flow
concentrated around the maximum pressure ridge-line observed at low
frequencies. Our work provides a potential explanation for the apparent
transversal superluminal speeds observed in several extragalactic jets by means
of transversal shift of an apparent core position with time.

presence of microwave fields is studied by using the Keldysh nonequilibrium
Green function technique. When the microwave is applied only on the QD and in
the linear-response regime, the main peaks in the thermoelectric figure of
merit and the thermopower are found to decrease, with the emergence of a set of
photon-induced peaks. Under this condition the microwave field can not generate
heat current or electrical bias voltage. Surprisingly, when the microwave field
is applied only to one (bright) lead and not to the other (dark) lead or the
QD, heat flows mostly from the dark to the bright lead, almost irrespectively
to the direction of the thermal gradient. We attribute this effect to
microwave-induced opening of additional transport channels below the Fermi
energy. The microwave field can change both the magnitude and the sign of the
electrical bias voltage induced by the temperature gradient.
