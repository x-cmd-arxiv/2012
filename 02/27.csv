moving through a semiconductor quantum dot under a longitudinal electric field,
which is defined along the $x$-direction. We study the relative influence of
the Rashba and Dresselhaus terms on the spin-Hall effect for the first
propagating and edge channels, by analyzing the mixing between spin-up and
-down states and the zero-field spin splitting along the transverse directions.
When the spin rotation depends only on the $y$-coordinate, the spin orientation
and the spin density vary along this transverse coordinate and, in this case,
we show that the spin-Hall effect is only due to the Dresselhaus term, for
depolarized electrons. On the other hand, if the spin rotation depends on the
$z$-coordinate, the spin-Hall effect is provoked only by the Rashba
interaction.

a SM-like Higgs with the mass 123-127 GeV and study its implication in low
energy SUSY by comparing the MSSM and NMSSM. We consider various experimental
constraints at 2-sigma level (including the muon g-2 and the dark matter relic
density) and perform a comprehensive scan over the parameter space of each
model. Then in the parameter space which is allowed by current experimental
constraints and also predicts a SM-like Higgs in 123-127 GeV, we examine the
properties of the sensitive parameters (like the top squark mass and the
trilinear coupling A_t) and calculate the rates of the di-photon signal and the
VV^* (V=W,Z) signals at the LHC. Our typical findings are: (i) In the MSSM the
top squark and A_t must be large and thus incur some fine-tuning, which can be
much ameliorated in the NMSSM; (ii) In the MSSM a light stau is needed to
enhance the di-photon rate of the SM-like Higgs to exceed its SM prediction,
while in the NMSSM the di-photon rate can be readily enhanced in several ways;
(iii) In the MSSM the signal rates of pp -> h -> VV^* at the LHC are never
enhanced compared with their SM predictions, while in the NMSSM they may get
enhanced significantly; (iv) A large part of the parameter space so far
survived will be soon covered by the expected XENON100(2012) sensitivity

Most of the mid-infrared emission in the MIPS images is produced by
circumstellar dust heated in the non-radiative shocks around G292.0+1.8,
confirming the results of earlier mid-IR observations with AKARI. In addition
to emission from hot dust, we have also mapped atomic line emission between 14
micron and 36 micron using IRS spectral maps. The line emission is primarily
associated with the bright oxygen-rich optical knots, but is also detected from
fast-moving knots of ejecta. We confirm our earlier detection of 15-25 micron
emission characteristic of magnesium silicate dust in spectra of the
radiatively shocked ejecta. We do not detect silicon line emission from any of
the radiatively shocked ejecta in the southeast of the SNR, possibly because
that the reverse shock has not yet penetrated most of the Si-rich ejecta in
that region. This may indicate that G292.0+1.8 is less evolved in the southeast

  The workshop is devoted to model-based testing of both software and hardware.
Model-based testing uses models describing the required behavior of the system
under consideration to guide such efforts as test selection and test results
evaluation. Testing validates the real system behavior against models and
checks that the implementation conforms to them, but is capable also to find
errors in the models themselves.
  The first MBT workshop was held in 2004, in Barcelona. At that time MBT
already had become a hot topic, but the MBT workshop was the first event
devoted mostly to this topic. Since that time the area has generated enormous
scientific interest, and today there are several specialized workshops and more
broad conferences on software and hardware design and quality assurance
covering model based testing. MBT has become one of the most powerful system
analysis tools, one of the latest hot topic related is applying MBT in security
analysis and testing. MBT workshop tries to keep up with current trends. In
2012 ""industrial paper"" category was added to the program and two industrial

Debye-$\rm{\ddot{u}}$ckel equation for potential near complex

electrode on electric double layer (EDL) is obtained using ""multiple scattering

terms of the ratio of Gouy screening length and the local principal radii of
curvature of surface. We also include a contribution of compact layer, which is
significant in overall prediction of capacitance. Our general results are
analyzed in details for two special morphologies of electrodes, i.e.
""nanoporous membrane"" and ""forest of nanopillars"". Variations of local shapes
and global size variations due to residual randomness in morphology are
accounted as curvature fluctuations over a reference shape element.
Particularly, the theory shows that the presence of geometrical fluctuations in
porous systems causes enhanced dependence of capacitance on mean pore sizes and
suppresses the magnitude of capacitance. Theory emphasizes a strong influence
of overall morphology and its disorder on capacitance. Finally, our predictions
are in reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements on
supercapacitive mesoporous systems.

channels with full knowledge of the main channel and only the statistics of the

multiple-input, single-output, single-antenna eavesdropper systems, we
generalize Goel and Negi's celebrated artificial-noise (AN) assisted
beamforming, which just selects the directions to transmit AN heuristically.
Our scheme may inject AN to the direction of the message, which outperforms
Goel and Negi's scheme where AN is only injected in the directions orthogonal
to the main channel. The ergodic secrecy rate of the proposed AN scheme can be
represented by a highly simplified power allocation problem. To attain it, we
prove that the optimal transmission scheme for the message bearing signal is a
beamformer, which is aligned to the direction of the legitimate channel. After
characterizing the optimal eigenvectors of the covariance matrices of signal
and AN, we also provide the necessary condition for transmitting AN in the main
channel to be optimal. Since the resulting secrecy rate is a non-convex power
allocation problem, we develop an algorithm to efficiently solve it. Simulation
results show that our generalized AN scheme outperforms Goel and Negi's,
especially when the quality of legitimate channel is much worse than that of
eavesdropper's. In particular, the regime with non-zero secrecy rate is
enlarged, which can significantly improve the connectivity of the secure
network when the proposed AN assisted beamforming is applied.

Daubechies in
1988, states that the eigenfunctions of a time-frequency localization operator
with circular localization domain and Gaussian analysis window are the Hermite
functions. In this contribution, a converse of Daubechies' theorem is proved.
More precisely, it is shown that, for simply connected localization domains, if
one of the eigenfunctions of a time-frequency localization operator with
Gaussian window is a Hermite function, then its localization domain is a disc.
The general problem of obtaining, from some knowledge of its eigenfunctions,
information about the symbol of a time-frequency localization operator, is
denoted as the inverse problem, and the problem studied by Daubechies as the
direct problem of time-frequency analysis. Here, we also solve the
corresponding problem for wavelet localization, providing the inverse problem
analogue of the direct problem studied by Daubechies and Paul.

Contrary to the classical free shear layer, the width of the shear zone does
not vary in the streamwise direction but rather exhibits a lateral variation.
Based on some simplifying assumptions, an analytic solution has been derived
for the new shear layer. These assumptions have been justified by a comparison
with numerical solutions of the full Navier-Stokes equations, which accord with
the analytical solution to better than 1% in the entire domain. An explicit
formula is found for the width of the shear zone as a function of wall-normal
coordinate. This width is independent of wall velocities in the laminar regime.
Preliminary results for a co-current laminar-turbulent shear layer in the same
geometry are also presented. Shear-layer instabilities were then developed and
resulted in an unsteady mixing zone at the interface between the two co-current
streams.

recently attracted much attention due to its intrinsic robustness to the
presence of outliers and missing data. In this paper, we propose a new method,
called the divide-and-conquer method, for solving this problem. The main idea
is to break the original problem into a series of smallest possible
sub-problems, each involving only unique scalar parameter. Each of these
subproblems is proved to be convex and has closed-form solution. By recursively
optimizing these small problems in an analytical way, efficient algorithm,
entirely avoiding the time-consuming numerical optimization as an inner loop,
for solving the original problem can naturally be constructed. The
computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is approximately linear in
both data size and dimensionality, making it possible to handle large-scale L1
norm matrix factorization problems. The algorithm is also theoretically proved
to be convergent. Based on a series of experiment results, it is substantiated
that our method always achieves better results than the current
state-of-the-art methods on $L1$ matrix factorization calculation in both
computational time and accuracy, especially on large-scale applications such as
face recognition and structure from motion.

blows the superconductivity community by surprise because such a high Tc is
unexpected in FeSe system with the bulk FeSe exhibiting a Tc at only 8 K at
ambient pressure which can be enhanced to 38 K under high pressure. The Tc is
still unusually high even considering the newly-discovered intercalated FeSe
system A_xFe_{2-y}Se_2 (A=K, Cs, Rb and Tl) with a Tc at 32 K at ambient
pressure and possible Tc near 48 K under high pressure. Particularly
interesting is that such a high temperature superconductivity occurs in a
single-layer FeSe system that is considered as a key building block of the
Fe-based superconductors. Understanding the origin of high temperature
superconductivity in such a strictly two-dimensional FeSe system is crucial to
understanding the superconductivity mechanism in Fe-based superconductors in
particular, and providing key insights on how to achieve high temperature
superconductivity in general. Here we report distinct electronic structure
associated with the single-layer FeSe superconductor. Its Fermi surface
topology is different from other Fe-based superconductors; it consists only of
electron pockets near the zone corner without indication of any Fermi surface
around the zone center. Our observation of large and nearly isotropic
superconducting gap in this strictly two-dimensional system rules out existence
of node in the superconducting gap. These results have provided an unambiguous
case that such a unique electronic structure is favorable for realizing high

The spectrum of radiated axions has a peak at the low frequency, which implies
that axions produced by the collapse of domain walls are not highly
relativistic. We revisit the relic abundance of cold dark matter axions and
find that the contribution from the decay of defects can be comparable with the
contribution from strings. This result leads to a more severe upper bound on

false positives yielding 1,091 viable new planet candidates, bringing the total
count up to over 2,300. Improved vetting metrics are employed, contributing to
higher catalog reliability. Most notable is the noise-weighted robust averaging
of multi-quarter photo-center offsets derived from difference image analysis
which identifies likely background eclipsing binaries. Twenty-two months of
photometry are used for the purpose of characterizing each of the new
candidates. Ephemerides (transit epoch, T_0, and orbital period, P) are
tabulated as well as the products of light curve modeling: reduced radius
(Rp/R*), reduced semi-major axis (d/R*), and impact parameter (b). The largest
fractional increases are seen for the smallest planet candidates (197% for
candidates smaller than 2Re compared to 52% for candidates larger than 2Re) and
those at longer orbital periods (123% for candidates outside of 50-day orbits
versus 85% for candidates inside of 50-day orbits). The gains are larger than
expected from increasing the observing window from thirteen months (Quarter 1--
Quarter 5) to sixteen months (Quarter 1 -- Quarter 6). This demonstrates the
benefit of continued development of pipeline analysis software. The fraction of
all host stars with multiple candidates has grown from 17% to 20%, and the
paucity of short-period giant planets in multiple systems is still evident. The
progression toward smaller planets at longer orbital periods with each new

received a lot of attention in the last years, because of their wide range of
applications in theoretical cryptography. The notion has been recently extended
to the identity-based setting by Bellare et al. (Eurocrypt'12). We provide one
more step in this direction, by considering the notion of hierarchical
identity-based (lossy) trapdoor functions (HIB-TDFs). Hierarchical
identity-based cryptography has proved very useful both for practical
applications and to establish theoretical relations with other cryptographic
primitives.
  The notion of security for IB-TDFs put forward by Bellare et al. easily
extends to the hierarchical scenario, but an (H)IB-TDF secure in this sense is
not known to generically imply other related primitives with security against
adaptive-id adversaries, not even IND-ID-CPA secure encryption. Our first
contribution is to define a new security property for (H)IB-TDFs. We show that
functions satisfying this property imply secure cryptographic primitives in the
adaptive identity-based setting: these include encryption schemes with semantic
security under chosen-plaintext attacks, deterministic encryption schemes, and
(non-adaptive) hedged encryption schemes that maintain some security when
messages are encrypted using randomness of poor quality.
  Then, we describe the first pairing-based HIB-TDF realization. Our HIB-TDF
construction is based on techniques that differ from those of Bellare et al. in
that it uses a hierarchical predicate encryption scheme as a key ingredient.
The resulting HIB-TDF is proved to satisfy the new security definition, against
either selective or, for hierarchies of constant depth, adaptive adversaries.

uncertainty at both the instrument and covariate level. We propose a Two-Stage
Bayesian Model Averaging (2SBMA) methodology that extends the Two-Stage Least
Squares (2SLS) estimator. By constructing a Two-Stage Unit Information Prior in
the endogenous variable model, we are able to efficiently combine established
methods for addressing model uncertainty in regression models with the classic
technique of 2SLS. To assess the validity of instruments in the 2SBMA context,
we develop Bayesian tests of the identification restriction that are based on
model averaged posterior predictive p-values. A simulation study showed that
2SBMA has the ability to recover structure in both the instrument and covariate
set, and substantially improves the sharpness of resulting coefficient
estimates in comparison to 2SLS using the full specification in an automatic
fashion. Due to the increased parsimony of the 2SBMA estimate, the Bayesian
Sargan test had a power of 50 percent in detecting a violation of the
exogeneity assumption, while the method based on 2SLS using the full
specification had negligible power. We apply our approach to the problem of
development accounting, and find support not only for institutions, but also
for geography and integration as development determinants, once both model
uncertainty and endogeneity have been jointly addressed.

rms). This concurs with results from a previous study of Cygnus X-1 (Gleissner

of states. We find a strong dependence of the flux intercept of the rms-flux
relation on source state; as the source transitions from the hard state into
the hard intermediate state the intercept becomes strongly positive. We find
little evidence for flux dependence of the broad-band noise within the PSD
shape, excepting a small subset of observations from one object in an anomalous
soft-state. We speculate that the ubiquitous linear rms-flux relation in the

measuring turbulent diffusion and anisotropy of the turbulent velocity field

FLASH); c) jet outflows from active galactic nuclei, AGN (simulated with
FLASH). The turbulent velocities driven by matter accretion in galaxy clusters
are mostly tangential in the inner regions (inside the cluster virial radius)
and isotropic in regions close to the virial radius. The same is found for
turbulence excited by cool core sloshing, while the jet outflowing from AGN
drives mostly radial turbulence motions near its sonic point and beyond.
Turbulence leads to a diffusivity in the range =10^29-10^30 cm^2/s in the intra

driving in the intra cluster medium is represented by accretion of matter and

fundamental stellar parameters by applying the iron ionisation equilibrium
conditions to several isolated Fe I and Fe II lines. The metallicity
distributions of the different stellar samples suggest that there is a
transition toward higher metallicities from stars with neither debris discs nor

neither debris nor planets follow a similar metallicity distribution, although
the distribution of the first ones might be shifted towards higher

behaviour as stars hosting planets, irrespective of whether the planets are
low-mass or gas giants. In the case of debris discs and giant planets, the
planets are usually cool, -semimajor axis larger than 0.1 AU. The data also
suggest that stars with debris discs and cool giant planets tend to have a low

find evidence of an anticorrelation between the luminosity of the dust and the

functional theory applied to an extended jellium model with an all-electron
atom in the center. The study is related to recent experiments at the free
electron laser at DESY in which photoelectron spectra from mass-selected,
core-shell ionized metal clusters have been recorded. Relaxed and unrelaxed
binding energies as well as Kohn-Sham orbital energies are calculated in
Perdew-Zunger self-interaction-corrected exchange-only local spin-density
approximation for valence and 2p core electrons in Na clusters up to 58 atoms.
The relaxed binding energies follow approximately the metal-sphere behavior.
The same behavior is seen in the experiment for sufficiently big clusters,
indicating perfect screening and that the relaxation energy due to screening
goes to the photoelectron. Instead, calculating the kinetic energy of the
photoelectrons using unrelaxed binding energies or Kohn-Sham orbital energies
yields wrong results for core-shell electrons. The screening {\em dynamics} are
investigated using time-dependent density functional theory. It is shown that
screening occurs on two time scales, a core-shell-dependent inner-atomic and an
inter-atomic valence electron time scale. In the case of Na 2p ionization the
remaining electrons in the 2p shell screen within tens of attoseconds while the
screening due to cluster valence electrons occurs within several hundreds of
attoseconds. The screening time-scales may be compared to the photon energy and
cluster size-dependent escape times of the photoelectron in order to estimate
whether the photoelectron is capable of picking up the relaxation energy or
whether the residual system is left in an excited state.

the diameter of various families of Cayley networks. The previously known
estimate for the diameter of Cayley graphs generated by transposition trees is
an upper bound given in the oft-cited paper of Akers and Krishnamurthy (1989).
In this work, we first assess the performance of their upper bound. We show
that for every $n$, there exists a tree on $n$ vertices, such that the
difference between the upper bound and the true diameter value is at least
$n-4$.
  Evaluating their upper bound takes time $\Omega(n!)$. In this paper, we
provide an algorithm that obtains an estimate of the diameter, but which
requires only time $O(n^2)$; furthermore, the value obtained by our algorithm
is less than or equal to the previously known diameter upper bound. Such an
improvement to polynomial time, while still performing at least as well as the
previous bound, is possible because our algorithm works directly with the
transposition tree on $n$ vertices and does not require examining any of the
permutations. We also provide a tree for which the value computed by our
algorithm is not necessarily unique, which is an important result because such
examples are quite rare. For all families of trees we have investigated so far,
each of the possible values computed by our algorithm happens to also be an
upper bound on the diameter.

operator-theoretic context is motivated by composite systems of Partial
Differential Equations (PDE) with boundary or point control. Specific focus is
placed on systems of coupled hyperbolic/parabolic PDE with an overall
`predominant' hyperbolic character, such as, e.g., some models for
thermoelastic or fluid-structure interactions. While unbounded control actions
lead to Riccati equations with unbounded (operator) coefficients, unlike the
parabolic case solvability of these equations becomes a major issue, owing to
the lack of sufficient regularity of the solutions to the composite dynamics.
In the present case, even the more general theory appealing to estimates of the
singularity displayed by the kernel which occurs in the integral representation
of the solution to the control system fails. A novel framework which embodies
possible hyperbolic components of the dynamics has been introduced by the
authors in 2005, and a full theory of the LQ-problem on a finite time horizon
has been developed. The present paper provides the infinite time horizon
theory, culminating in well-posedness of the corresponding (algebraic) Riccati
equations. New technical challenges are encountered and new tools are needed,
especially in order to pinpoint the differentiability of the optimal solution.
The theory is illustrated by means of a boundary control problem arising in
thermoelasticity.

new observations of the C18O 3-2 and the HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} lines towards NGC
7129 FIRS 2. Combining these observations with Herschel data and modeling their
emissions, we constrain the C18O and HDO abundance profiles across the
protostellar envelope. In particular, we derive the abundance of C18O and HDO
in the hot core. The intensities of the C18O lines are well reproduced assuming
that the C18O abundance decreases through the protostellar envelope from the
outer edge towards the centre until the point where the gas and dust reach the
CO evaporation temperature (~20-25 K) where the C18O is released back to the
gas phase. Once the C18O is released to the gas phase, the modelled C18O
abundance is found to be ~1.6x10^{-8}, which is a factor of 10 lower than the
reference abundance. This result is supported by the non-detection of C18O 9-8,
which proves that even in the hot core (T_k>100 K) the CO abundance must be 10
times lower than the reference value. Several scenarios are discussed to
explain this C18O deficiency. One possible explanation is that during the
pre-stellar and protostellar phase, the CO is removed from the grain mantles by
reactions to form more complex molecules. Our HDO modeling shows that the
emission of HDO 3_{12}-2_{21} line is maser and comes from the hot core
(T_k>100 K). Assuming the physical structure derived by Crimier et al. (2010),
we determine a HDO abundance of ~0.4 - 1x10^{-7} in the hot core of this IM
protostar, similar to that found in the hot corinos NGC 1333 IRAS 2A and IRAS

for a complete sample of 34 ETGs morphologically selected at 0.9<z_{spec}<2 and
compare them with those derived for a sample of ~900 local ETGs in the same
mass range. We find that the central stellar mass density of high-z ETGs spans
just an order of magnitude and it is similar to the one of local ETGs as
actually found in previous studies.However, we find that the effective stellar
mass density of high-z ETGs spans three orders of magnitude, exactly as the
local ETGs and that it is similar to the effective stellar mass density of
local ETGs showing that it has not changed since z~1.5, in the last 9-10 Gyr.
Thus, the wide spread of the effective stellar mass density observed up to
z~1.5 must originate earlier, at z>2. Also, we show that the small scatter of
the central mass density of ETGs compared to the large scatter of the effective
mass density is simply a peculiar feature of the Sersic profile hence,
independent of redshift and of any assembly history experienced by galaxies.
Thus, it has no connection with the possible inside-out growth of ETGs.
Finally, we find a tight correlation between the central stellar mass density
and the total stellar mass of ETGs in the sense that the central mass density
increases with mass as M^{~0.6}. This implies that the fraction of the central
stellar mass of ETGs decreases with the mass of the galaxy. These correlations
are valid for the whole population of ETGs considered independently of their
redshift suggesting that they originate in the early-phases of their formation.

in many scientific fields. Very diverse algorithms and methods have been
proposed to this end, many working reasonably well in specific situations.
However, no consensus has emerged on which of these methods is the best to use
in practice. In part, this is due to the fact that testing their performance
requires the generation of a comprehensive, standard set of synthetic
benchmarks, a goal not yet fully achieved. Here, we present a type of benchmark
that we call ""closed"", in which an initial network of known community structure
is progressively converted into a second network whose communities are also
known. This approach differs from all previously published ones, in which
networks evolve toward randomness. The use of this type of benchmark allows us
to monitor the transformation of the community structure of a network.
Moreover, we can predict the optimal behavior of the variation of information,
a measure of the quality of the partitions obtained, at any moment of the
process. This enables us in many cases to determine the best partition among
those suggested by different algorithms. Also, since any network can be used as
a starting point, extensive studies and comparisons can be performed using a
heterogeneous set of structures, including random ones. These properties make
our benchmarks a general standard for comparing community detection algorithms.

small impact parameter, the planets may sufficiently lose their kinetic energy

tangential collision, it flews safety away. At the same time, the planets loss
some part of their gas envelopes during mutual collisions. Collisions of the
giant planets must be accompanied also by the radiation of energy from the
radio to optical bands. The optical and near UV flashes result from the
collision heating of the planet surface layers. Additionally, the collision
compression and collapse of the powerful magnetosphere of giant planets are

and east unit steps, starting at (0,0), ending at (mn,n), and never going below
the line {x=my}. The set of these paths can be equipped with a lattice
structure, called the m-Tamari lattice and denoted by T_n^{m}, which
generalizes the usual Tamari lattice T_n obtained when m=1. This lattice was
introduced by F. Bergeron in connection with the study of diagonal coinvariant
spaces in three sets of n variables. The representation of the symmetric group
S_n on these spaces is conjectured to be closely related to the natural
representation of S_n on (labelled) intervals of the m-Tamari lattice, which we
study in this paper. An interval [P,Q] of T_n^{m} is labelled if the north
steps of Q are labelled from 1 to n in such a way the labels increase along any
sequence of consecutive north steps. The symmetric group S_n acts on labelled
intervals of T_n^{m} by permutation of the labels. We prove an explicit
formula, conjectured by F. Bergeron and the third author, for the character of
the associated representation of S_n. In particular, the dimension of the
representation, that is, the number of labelled m-Tamari intervals of size n,
is found to be (m+1)^n(mn+1)^{n-2}. These results are new, even when m=1. The
form of these numbers suggests a connection with parking functions, but our
proof is not bijective. The starting point is a recursive description of
m-Tamari intervals. It yields an equation for an associated generating
function, which is a refined version of the Frobenius series of the
representation. This equation involves two additional variables x and y, a
derivative with respect to y and iterated divided differences with respect to
x. The hardest part of the proof consists in solving it, and we develop
original techniques to do so, partly inspired by previous work on polynomial
equations with ""catalytic"" variables.

with a family of mutually equivalent (usual) metrics such that the convergence
(resp. property of being Cauchy sequence, contractivity condition) in TVS sense
is equivalent to convergence (resp. property of being Cauchy sequence,
contractivity condition) in all of these metrics. As a consequence, we prove
that if a topological vector space $E$ and a solid cone $P$ are given, then the
category of TVS-cone metric spaces is a proper subcategory of metric spaces
with a family of mutually equivalent metrics (Corollary 3.9). Hence,
generalization of a result from metric spaces to TVS-cone metric spaces is
meaningless. This, also, leads to a formal deriving of fixed point results from
metric spaces to TVS-cone metric spaces and makes some earlier results vague.

genome-reduced model bacterial organism, by tracking the damage propagating on
its metabolic network after a deleterious perturbation. First, we analyzed
failure cascades spreading from individual reactions and pairs of reactions and
compared the results to those in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. To
alert to the potential damage caused by the failure of individual reactions, we
propose a generic predictor based on local information that identifies target
reactions for structural vulnerability. With respect to the simultaneous
failure of pairs of reactions, we detected strong non-linear amplification
effects that can be predicted by the presence of specific motifs in the
intersection of single cascades. We further connected the metabolic and gene
co-expression networks of M. pneumoniae through enzyme activities, and studied
the consequences of knocking out individual genes and clusters of genes. Damage
caused by single gene knockouts reveals a strong correlation between
genome-scale cascades of large impact and gene essentiality. At the same time,
we found that genes controlling high-damage reactions tend to operate in
functional isolation, as a metabolic protection mechanism. We conclude that the
architecture of M. pneumoniae, both at the level of metabolism and genome,
seems to have evolved towards increased structural robustness, similarly to
other more complex model bacterial organisms, despite its reduced genome size
and its greater metabolic network linearity. Our approach, although motivated
biochemically, is generic enough to be of potential use toward analyzing and
predicting spreading of structural stress in any bipartite complex network.

timing-model parameter estimates in the presence of TCSSs, as well as
computationally more efficient expressions of their marginalised posterior

a set cover optimization problem, which we solve approximately using standard
approaches. While prototype selection is usually viewed as purely a means

inherent value of having a set of prototypical elements. That said, by using
the nearest-neighbor rule on the set of prototypes, we can of course discuss
our method as a classifier as well.

a lower bound that is a significant fraction of the scalar field mass. We argue

The physics scenarios considered include precision measurements of known

Model. The report describes the detector performance required at CLIC, taking
into account the interaction point environment and especially beaminduced
backgrounds. Two detector concepts, designed around highly granular
calorimeters and based on concepts studied for the International Linear
Collider (ILC), are described and used to study the physics reach and potential
of such a collider. Detector subsystems and the principal engineering
challenges are illustrated. The overall performance of these CLIC detector
concepts is demonstrated by studies of the performance of individual
subdetector systems as well as complete simulation studies of six benchmark
physics processes. These full detector simulation and reconstruction studies
include beaminduced backgrounds and physics background processes. After
optimisation of the detector concepts and adopting the reconstruction
algorithms the results show very efficient background rejection and clearly
demonstrate the physics potential at CLIC in terms of precision mass and cross
section measurements. Finally, an overview of future plans of the CLIC detector
and physics study is given and a list of key detector R&D topics needed for
detectors at CLIC is presented.

Quantum connectivity between nodes is achieved in the conceptually most

the faithful transfer of an atomic quantum state and the creation of
entanglement between two identical nodes in independent laboratories. The
created nonlocal state is manipulated by local qubit rotation. This efficient

non-monotonic temperature and chemical potential dependence, with the size
depending on the crystallographic orientation of the principal axis of the

resolution required to observe dense and cold molecular clouds. As these clouds
are optically thick at short wavelength but optically thin at long wavelength,
it is tricky to conclude anything about dust properties without a proper
treatment of the radiative transfer (RT). Our aim is to disentangle the effects
of RT and of dust properties on the variations in the dust emission to provide
observers with keys to analyse the emission arising from dense clouds. We model
cylindrical clouds, illuminated by the ISRF, and carry out full RT
calculations. Dust temperatures are solved using DustEM for amorphous carbons
and silicates, grains coated with carbon mantles, and mixed aggregates of
carbon and silicate. We allow variations of the grain optical properties with
wavelength and temperature. We determine observed colour temperatures, T, and
emissivity spectral indices, beta, by fitting the dust emission with modified
blackbodies, to compare our models with observations. RT effects can neither
explain the low T nor the increased submm emissivity measured at the centre of
dense clouds, nor the observed beta-T anti-correlation. Adding noise to the
modelled data, we show that it is not likely to be the unique explanation for
the beta-T anti-correlation observed in starless clouds. It may be explained by
intrinsic variations in the grain optical properties with temperature. As for
the increased submm emissivity and the low T, they have to originate in
variations in the grain optical properties, probably caused by their growth to
form porous aggregates. We find it difficult to track back the nature of grains
from the spectral variations in their emission. Finally, the column density is
underestimated when determined with blackbody fitting because of the
discrepancy between T and the true dust temperature at the cloud centre.

applications, it is assumed that the relays and the destinations all have
access to side information correlated with the underlying source signal. Joint
source-channel cooperative transmission is studied in which the relays help the
transmission of the source signal to the destinations by using both their
overheard signals, as in the classical channel cooperation scenario, as well as
the available correlated side information. Decode-and-forward (DF) based
cooperative transmission is considered in a network of multiple relay terminals
and two different achievability schemes are proposed: i) a regular encoding and
sliding-window decoding scheme without explicit source binning at the encoder,
and ii) a semi-regular encoding and backward decoding scheme with binning based
on the side information statistics. It is shown that both of these schemes lead
to the same source-channel code rate, which is shown to be the ""source-channel
capacity"" in the case of i) a physically degraded relay network in which the
side information signals are also degraded in the same order as the channel;
and ii) a relay-broadcast network in which all the terminals want to
reconstruct the source reliably, while at most one of them can act as a relay.

a dispersion of 40-60 km/s. On average the integrated column densities are log
N(OVI)=14.3, log N(NV)=13.5, log N(CIV)=14.2, log N(SiIV)=13.6 and log

conductive interfaces, turbulent mixing, thick disk supernovae, static
non-equilibrium ionization (NIE) radiative cooling and an NIE radiative cooling
model in which the gas flows through the cooling zone. None of these models can
fully reproduce the data, but it is clear that non-equilibrium ionization

the presence of multiscale aspects one faces additional difficulties and
straightforward adaptation of importance sampling schemes for standard small

interact with the surrounding environment, with the other particles in the
system and be implemented using imperfect controls making it subject to noise.
It has been suggested that noise does not need to be controlled to the same
extent as it must be for general quantum computing. However the effects of
noise in quantum simulations and how to treat them are not completely
understood. In this paper we study an existing quantum algorithm for the
one-dimensional Fano-Anderson model to be simulated using a liquid-state NMR
device. We calculate the evolution of different initial states in the original
model, and then we add interacting spins to simulate a more realistic
situation. We find that states which are entangled with their environment, and
sometimes correlated but not necessarily entangled have an evolution which is

for this to occur and also the implications.

bounded Hessian. Our model constitutes a straightforward higher-order extension
of the well known ROF functional (total variation minimisation) to which we add
a non-smooth second order regulariser. It combines convex functions of the
total variation and the total variation of the first derivatives. In what
follows, we prove existence and uniqueness of minimisers of the combined model
and present the numerical solution of the corresponding discretised problem by
employing the split Bregman method. The paper is furnished with applications of
our model to image denoising, deblurring as well as image inpainting. The
obtained numerical results are compared with results obtained from total
generalised variation (TGV), infimal convolution and Euler's elastica, three
other state of the art higher-order models. The numerical discussion confirms
that the proposed higher-order model competes with models of its kind in
avoiding the creation of undesirable artifacts and blocky-like structures in
the reconstructed images -- a known disadvantage of the ROF model -- while
being simple and efficiently numerically solvable.

Series VII/2 (2009), 77-85",,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a novel solution to the age long problem of password
security at input level. In our solution, each of the various characters from
which a password could be composed is encoded with a random single digit
integer and presented to the user via an input interface form. A legitimate
user entering his password only needs to carefully study the sequence of code
that describe his password, and then enter these code in place of his actual
password characters. This approach does not require the input code to be hidden
from anyone or converted to placeholder characters for security reasons. Our
solution engine regenerates new code for each character each time the carriage
return key is struck, producing a hardened password that is convincingly more
secure than conventional password entry system against both online and offline
attackers. Using empirical data and a prototype implementation of our scheme,
we give evidence that our approach is viable in practice, in terms of ease of
use, improved security, and performance.

Resolution can be improved through a deconvolution process with a priori
information of the pulse or by its estimation. In this paper a regularization
of the Wiener filter using wavelet shrinkage is presented for the estimation of
the reflectivity function. The final result shows an improved signal to noise
ratio with better axial resolution.
