monitoring the dwarf Seyfert nucleus in NGC 4395 in 2008-2009. The UV/optical
flux from the nucleus was found to vary dramatically over the monitoring
period, with a similar pattern of variation in each of the observed UV/optical
bands (spanning 1900 - 5500 {\AA}). In particular, the luminosity of NGC 4395
in the 1900 {\AA} band changed by more than a factor of eight over the
monitoring period. The fractional variability was smaller in the UV/optical
bands than that seen in the X-rays, with the X-ray/optical ratio increasing
with increasing flux. Pseudo-instantaneous flux measurements in the X-ray and
each UV/optical band were well correlated, with cross correlation coefficients
of >0.7, significant at 99.9 per cent confidence. Archival Swift observations
from 2006 sample the intra-day X-ray/optical variability on NGC 4395. These
archival data show a very strong correlation between the X-ray and b bands,
with a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.84 (significant at >99 per cent
confidence). The peak in the cross correlation function is marginally resolved
and asymmetric, suggesting that X-rays lead the b band, but by 1 hour. In
response to recent (August 2011) very high X-ray flux levels from NGC4395 we
triggered Swift ToO observations, which sample the intra-hour X-ray/UV
variability. These observations indicate, albeit with large uncertainties, a
lag of the 1900 {\AA} band behind the X-ray flux of ~400 s. The tight
correlation between the X-ray and UV/optical lightcurves, together with the
constraints we place on lag time-scale are consistent with the UV/optical
variability of NGC 4395 being primarily due to reprocessing of X-ray photons by
the accretion disc.

rigid exclusion of dimers on the closely packed square lattice. In previous
work we considered the analogous problem on the hexagonal lattice, and we
extended the set-up to include the correlation of any finite number of monomer
clusters. For fairly general classes of monomer clusters we proved that the
asymptotics of their correlation is given, for large separations between the
clusters, by a multiplicative version of Coulomb's law for 2D electrostatics.
However, our previous results required that the monomer clusters consist (with
possibly one exception) of an even number of monomers. In this paper we
determine the asymptotics of general defect clusters along a lattice diagonal
in the square lattice (involving an arbitrary, even or odd number of monomers),

modeling of kHz quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) from neutron stars, to the
inner region of an accretion disk around a rotating black hole. Within a
pseudo-Newtonian approach that keeps the ratio of the radial epicyclic
frequency $\kappa$ to the orbital frequency $\Omega$ the same as the
corresponding ratio for a Kerr black hole we determine the innermost disk
region where the hydrodynamic modes grow in amplitude. We find that the
radiation flux emerging from the inner disk has the highest values within the
same region. Using the flux weighted averages of the frequency bands over this
region we identify the growing modes with highest frequency branches $\Omega
+\kappa $ and $\Omega $ to be the plausible candidates for the high-frequency
QPO pairs observed in black hole systems. The observed frequency ratio around
1.5 can therefore be understood naturally in terms of the global free
oscillations in the innermost region of a viscous accretion disk around a black
hole without invoking a particular resonance to produce black hole QPOs.
Although the frequency ratio $<\Omega +\kappa>/<\Omega>$ is found to be not
sensitive to the black hole's spin which is good for explaining the
high-frequency QPOs it may work as a limited diagnostic of the spin parameter
to distinguish black holes with very large spin from the slowly rotating ones.
Within our model we estimate the frequency ratio of a high-frequency QPO pair
to be greater than 1.5 if the black hole is a slow rotator. For fast rotating
black holes, we expect the same ratio to be less than 1.5.

ellipticities due to peculiar motion. In our model, the galaxy ellipticities
are determined from the angular momentum of their host haloes, which can be
computed from the fluctuations statistics of a Gaussian random field.
Subsequent peculiar motion distorts the ellipticity field and causes changes in
the ellipticity correlations. Using analogies between this problem of shifted
ellipticity tensors and the displacements of polarisation tensors in
gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background we compute E-mode and
B-mode spectra of the time-evolved ellipticity field, where the displacements
are modelled with first and second order Lagrangian perturbation theory. For
EUCLID, ellipticity correlations are decreased on large multipoles l >1000,
amounting to up to 10% in the E-mode spectrum C_E^epsilon(l) and up to 60% in
the B-mode spectrum C_B^epsilon(l) at l~3000 due to the dispersing effect of
peculiar motion. E/B-mode conversion in analogy to CMB-lensing is present but
small. We conclude that distortions of the ellipticity field due to peculiar
motion is not affecting the prediction of ellipticity models on the scales
relevant for lensing in the case of EUCLID's galaxy distribution, but should
affect larger scales for surveys at lower redshifts.

their strategy when interacting $n_{g}$ times with other agents in an iterated
prisoners dilemma game, (ii) their spatial location on $K$ different islands.
After each generation, agents adopt strategies proportional to their average
payoff received. Assuming a mix of two cooperating and two defecting
strategies, we first investigate for isolated islands the conditions for an
exclusive domination of each of these strategies and their possible
coexistence. This allows to define a threshold frequency for cooperation that,
dependent on $n_{g}$ and the initial mix of strategies, describes the outbreak
of cooperation in the absense of migration. We then allow migration of a fixed
fraction of the population after each generation. Assuming a worst case
scenario where all islands are occupied by defecting strategies, whereas only
one island is occupied by cooperators at the threshold frequency, we determine
the optimal migration rate that allows the outbreak of cooperation on
\emph{all} islands. We further find that the threshold frequency divided by the
number of islands, i.e. the relative effort for invading defecting islands with
cooperators decreeses with the number of islands. We also show that there is
only a small bandwidth of migration rates, to allow the outbreak of
cooperation. Larger migration rates destroy cooperation.

enough symmetry in a flat ambient space. It is based on a procedure of
construction surfaces with a given symmetry. The method is used to classify the
embeddings of the Schwarzschild metric which have the symmetry of this
solution, and all such embeddings in a six-dimensional ambient space (i.e. a
space with a minimal possible dimension) are constructed. Four of the six
possible embeddings are already known, while the two others are new. One of the
new embeddings is asymptotically flat, while the other embeddings in a
six-dimensional ambient space do not have this property. The asymptotically
flat embedding can be of use in the analysis of the many-body problem, as well
as for the development of gravity description as a theory of a surface in a
flat ambient space.

and, in addition, the encoder that knows the states non-causally transmits an
individual message. We find explicit characterizations of the capacity region
of this communication model in both discrete memoryless and memoryless Gaussian
cases. The analysis also reveals optimal ways of exploiting the knowledge of
the state only strictly causally at the encoder that sends only the common
message when such a knowledge is beneficial. The encoders collaborate to convey
to the decoder a lossy version of the state, in addition to transmitting the
information messages through a generalized Gel'fand-Pinsker binning.
Particularly important in this problem are the questions of 1) optimal ways of
performing the state compression and 2) whether or not the compression indices

coding, i.e., with no binning, and compression using Wyner-Ziv binning are
optimal. The scheme that uses Wyner-Ziv binning shares elements with Cover and
El Gamal original compress-and-forward, but differs from it mainly in that
backward decoding is employed instead of forward decoding and the compression
indices are not decoded uniquely. Finally, by exploring the properties of our
outer bound, we show that, although not required in general, the compression
indices can in fact be decoded uniquely essentially without altering the
capacity region, but at the expense of larger alphabets sizes for the auxiliary
random variables.

gives an accurate estimate of the signal, or coefficient vector, for both of
these models. We demonstrate that an s-sparse signal in R^n can be accurately
estimated from m = O(slog(n/s)) single-bit measurements using a simple convex
program. This remains true even if each measurement bit is flipped with
probability nearly 1/2. Worst-case (adversarial) noise can also be accounted
for, and uniform results that hold for all sparse inputs are derived as well.
In the terminology of sparse logistic regression, we show that O(slog(n/s))
Bernoulli trials are sufficient to estimate a coefficient vector in R^n which
is approximately s-sparse. Moreover, the same convex program works for
virtually all generalized linear models, in which the link function may be
unknown. To our knowledge, these are the first results that tie together the
theory of sparse logistic regression to 1-bit compressed sensing. Our results
apply to general signal structures aside from sparsity; one only needs to know
the size of the set K where signals reside. The size is given by the mean width
of K, a computable quantity whose square serves as a robust extension of the
dimension.

existence of the solution which satisfies the radiation conditions at infinity
as well as, additionally, at the cusp point where the body touches the water
surface. This solution is obtained by the limiting absorption procedure.
  Next we introduce a relevant scattering matrix and analyse its properties.
Under a geometric condition introduced by Maz'ya, see \cite{M1}, we show that
the method of multipliers applies to cusp singularities, thus proving a new
important property of the scattering matrix, which may be interpreted as the
absence of a version of ""full internal reflection"". This property also allows
us to prove uniqueness and existence of the solution in the functional spaces

spectral parameter in the boundary conditions on the surface of the water is
large enough.

periods of galaxy mergers and properties of other cosmological encounters, the
cosmic star formation history (CSFH), is of fundamental importance. Using the
association of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) with the death of massive stars
and their ultra-luminous nature, the CSFH can be probed to higher redshifts
than current conventional methods. Unfortunately, no consensus has been reached
on the manner in which the LGRB rate (LGRBR) traces the CSFH, leaving many of
the questions mentioned mostly unexplored by this method. Observations by the
GRB NIR detector (GROND) over the past 4 years have, for the first time,
acquired highly complete LGRB samples. Driven by these completeness levels and
new evidence of LGRBs also occurring in more massive and metal rich galaxies
than previously thought, the possible biases of the LGRBR-CSFH connection are
investigated over a large range of galaxy properties. The CSFH is modelled
using empirical fits to the galaxy mass function and galaxy star formation
rates. Biasing the CSFH by metallicity cuts, mass range boundaries, and other
unknown redshift dependencies, a LGRBR is generated and compared to the highly
complete GROND sample. It is found that there is no strong preference for a
metallicity cut or fixed galaxy mass boundaries and that there are no unknown
redshift effects, in contrast to previous work which suggest values of
Z/Z_sun~0.1-0.3. From the best-fit models, we predict that ~1.2% of the LGRB
burst sample exists above z=6. The linear relationship between the LGRBR and
the CSFH suggested by our results implies that redshift biases present in
previous LGRB samples significantly affect the inferred dependencies of LGRBs
on their host galaxy properties. Such biases can lead to, e.g., an
interpretation of metallicity limitations and evolving LGRB luminosity
functions.

because the one-time pad is perfectly hiding, the hash function used remains
completely unknown to the adversary.
  Since their proof is not composable, we revisit it using a composable
security framework. It turns out that the above argument is insufficient: if
the adversary learns whether a corrupted message was accepted or rejected,
information about the hash function is leaked, and after a bounded finite
amount of rounds it is completely known. We show however that this leak is very
small: Wegman and Carter's protocol is still $\epsilon$-secure, if
$\epsilon$-almost strongly universal$_2$ hash functions are used. This implies
that the secret key corresponding to the choice of hash function can be reused
in the next round of authentication without any additional error than this
$\epsilon$.
  We also show that if the players have a mild form of synchronization, namely
that the receiver knows when a message should be received, the key can be
recycled for any arbitrary task, not only new rounds of authentication.

selfish behavior of the players. It contributes to the line of work initiated
by Procaccia and Tennenholtz [EC09] on approximate mechanism design without
money. We explore and argue for an intuitive and simple rule of complexity
O(nk),a so-called proportionality mechanism. The mechanism works in k
consecutive rounds,each time choosing a random player at whose position to
place the next facility; each time the probabilities of players to be picked
are distributed proportionally to their distances to the current set of the
facilities. Lu et al. [EC10] showed that the proportionality rule is incentive
compatible for k=1,2, but fails to be so for k>2.
  We tweak the model slightly such that for any k, the proportionality
mechanism becomes incentive compatible. In the new model we allow the
government to be bureaucratic, i.e., to have the power of to force each player
to choose from only a specific set of available facilities. In the
proportionality mechanism, we force every player that receives a facility at
his reported location to connect to exactly that facility. We extend the
proportionality mechanism to a more general setting with a private network of
facilities already present in the metric space and show that it is truthful as
well.
  We further show that for any fixed k, the proportionality rule achieves in
expectation a constant approximation guarantee to the optimal solution; namely
at most a ratio of 4k. On the other hand, we show a lower bound of ln
k(1+o(1)), and we suspect the truth to be closer to this lower bound. Thus, our
work is the first among those on incentive compatible facility location that
treats effectively (with a constant factor of approximation) the general case
of an arbitrary number of facilities.

computational experiments and systematizing existing evidences from the

Considering a realistic stochastic spectrum of inhomogeneities of primordial
(inflationary) origin we find that both the induced backreaction on the
luminosity-redshift relation and the dispersion are larger than naively
expected. On the other hand the former, at least to leading order and in the
linear perturbative regime, cannot account by itself for the observed effects
of dark energy at large-redshifts. A full second-order calculation, or even
better a reliable estimate of contributions from the non-linear regime, appears
to be necessary before firm conclusions on the correct interpretation of the

using a blend of imaging and spectroscopic diagnostics. Single Gaussian fits to
hot emission line profiles (formed above 1MK) at the base of coronal loop
structures indicate material blue-shifts of 5-10km/s while cool emission line
profiles (formed below 1MK) yield red-shifts of a similar magnitude -
indicating, to zeroth order, that a temperature-dependent bifurcating flow
exists on coronal structures. Image sequences of the same region reveal weakly
emitting upward propagating disturbances in both hot and cool emission with
apparent speeds of 50-150km/s. Spectroscopic observations indicate that these
propagating disturbances produce a weak emission component in the blue wing at
commensurate speed, but that they contribute only a few percent to the
(ensemble) emission line profile in a single spatio-temporal resolution
element. Subsequent analysis of imaging data shows material ""draining"" slowly
(~10km/s) out of the corona, but only in the cooler passbands. We interpret the
draining as the return-flow of coronal material at the end of the complex
chromosphere-corona mass cycle. Further, we suggest that the efficient
radiative cooling of the draining material produces a significant contribution
to the red wing of cool emission lines that is ultimately responsible for their
systematic red-shift as derived from a single Gaussian fit when compared to
those formed in hotter (conductively dominated) domains. The presence of
counter-streaming flows complicates the line profiles, their interpretation,
and asymmetry diagnoses, but allows a different physical picture of the lower
corona to develop.

consequences concerning the black string horizon variation along the extra

drastically modified by the terms corrected by the brane variable tension. In
particular, a model motivated by the phenomenological interesting case
regarding Eotvos branes is investigated. It forthwith provides further physical
features regarding variable tension braneworld scenarios, heretofore concealed
in all previous analysis in the literature. All precedent analysis considered
uniquely the expansion of the metric up to the second order along the extra
dimension, what is able to evince solely the brane variable tension absolute
value. Notwithstanding, the expansion terms aftermath, further accomplished in
this paper from the third order on, elicits the successive covariant
derivatives of the brane variable tension, and their respective coupling with

that the rate constants of the enzymatic reactions fluctuate randomly,
according to a given distribution. To quantify the uncertainty arising from
random rate constants, it is necessary to investigate how one can simulate such
a biochemical system. To do this, we will take the Gillespie's stochastic
simulation algorithm for simulating the evolution of the state of a chemical
system, and study a modification of the algorithm that incorporates the random
rate constants. In addition to simulating the waiting time of each reaction
step, the modified algorithm also involves simulating the random fluctuation of
the rate constant at each reaction time. We consider the modified algorithm in
a general framework, then specialize it to two contrasting physical models, one
in which the fluctuations occur on a much faster time scale than the reaction
step, and the other in which the fluctuations occur much more slowly. The
latter case was applied to the single enzyme reaction system, using in part the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to enact the given distribution on the random
rate constants. The modified algorithm is shown to produce simulation outputs
that are corroborated by the experimental results. It is hoped that this
modified algorithm can subsequently be used as a tool for the estimation or
calibration of parameters in the system using experimental data.

  Colliding Black Holes: The Non Head-on Case","11 pages, 7 figures",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We examine numerically the process of gravitational wave recoil in the merger
of two black holes in non head-on collision, in the realm of Robinson-Trautman
spacetimes. Characteristic initial data for the system are constructed, and the
evolution covers the post-merger phase up to the final configuration of the
remnant black hole. The net momentum flux carried out by gravitational waves
and the associated impulses are evaluated. Our analysis is based on the
Bondi-Sachs conservation laws for the energy momentum of the system. The net
kick velocity $V_{k}$ imparted to the merged system by the total gravitational
wave impulse is also evaluated. Typically for a non head-on collision the net
momentum flux carried out by gravitational waves is nonzero for equal-mass
colliding black holes. The distribution of $V_{k}$ as a function of the
symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ is well fitted by a modified Fitchett
$\eta$-scaling law, the additional parameter modifying the law being a measure
of the nonzero gravitational wave momentum flux for equal-mass initial black
holes. For an initial infalling velocity $v/c \simeq 0.462$ of the colliding
black holes, and incidence angle of collision $\rho_0=21^{o}$, we obtain a
maximum $V_{k} \sim 121 {\rm km/s}$ located at $\eta \simeq 0.226$. For initial
equal-mass black holes ($\eta=0.25$) we obtain $V_{k} \sim 107 {\rm km/s}$.
Based on the integrated Bondi-Sachs momentum conservation law we discuss a
possible definition of the center-of-mass velocity of the binary merged system
and show that -- in an appropriate inertial frame -- it approaches
asymptotically the net kick velocity, which is the velocity of the remnant
black hole in this inertial frame. For larger values of $v/c$ we obtain
substantially larger values of the net kick velocity, e.g., for $v/c \simeq
0.604$ a maximum $V_{k} \sim 610 {\rm km/s}$ is obtained.

diffusion limited crystal growth in the presence of anisotropic surface energy

morphological stability of ice crystals strongly depends on supersaturation,
crystal size and temperature. Until very recently it was very difficult to
perform numerical simulations of this highly anisotropic crystal growth. In
particular, obtaining facet growth in combination with dendritic branching is a
challenging task. We present numerical simulations of snow crystal growth in
two and three space dimensions using a new computational method recently
introduced by the authors. We present both qualitative and quantitative
computations. In particular, a linear relationship between tip velocity and
supersaturation is observed. The computations also suggest that surface energy
effects, although small, have a larger effect on crystal growth than previously
expected. We compute solid plates, solid prisms, hollow columns, needles,
dendrites, capped columns and scrolls on plates. Although all these forms
appear in nature, most of these forms are computed here for the first time in

energy cosmic rays (UHECR) at energies above \simeq 4.10E19 eV is a signature
of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff or corresponds, for instance, to
the maximum energies available at the relevant sources. Both phenomena can be
sensitive to violations of standard special relativity modifying cosmic-ray
propagation or acceleration at very high energy, and would in principle allow
to set bounds on Lorentz symmetry violation (LSV) parameters. But the precise
phenomenological analysis of the experimental data is far from trivial, and
other effects can be present. The effective parameters can be directly linked
to Planck-scale physics or to physics beyond Planck scale. If a vacuum rest
frame (VRF) exists, LSV can modify the internal structure of particles at very
high energy. Conventional symmetries may also cease to be valid at energies
close to the Planck scale. Other possible violations of fundamental principles
and conventional basic hypotheses (quantum mechanics, quark confinement, energy
and momentum conservation, vacuum homogeneity and ""static"" properties,
effective space dimensions...) can also be considered and possibly tested in
high-energy cosmic-ray experiments. Even below UHE (ultra-high energy), exotic
signatures cannot be excluded. We present an updated discussion of the
theoretical and phenomenological situation, including prospects for earth-based
and space experiments and a simple potential interpretation of the observed
UHECR composition in terms of LSV where the GZK cutoff would be replaced by
spontaneous emission of photons or e+ e- pairs. As the OPERA result on a

the presence of H-flux and certain fermion condensates. Unlike previous
studies, we do not assume the vanishing of the supersymmetry variations.
Instead we determine the full equations of motion originating from the
ten-dimensional action, and subsequently we provide explicit solutions to them
on nearly K\""ahler manifolds at first order in alpha'. The Bianchi identity is
also taken into account in order to guarantee the absence of all anomalies. In
the presence of H-flux, which is identified with the torsion of the internal
space, as well as of fermion condensates in the gaugino and dilatino sectors,
new solutions are determined. These solutions provide a full classification of
consistent backgrounds of heterotic supergravity under our assumptions. All the
new solutions are non-supersymmetric, while previously known supersymmetric
ones are recovered too. Our results indicate that fully consistent
(supersymmetric or not) heterotic vacua on nearly K\""ahler manifolds are
scarce, even on AdS_4, and they can be completely classified.

reflector is at a distance >30-50 pc, well within the imaging capabilities of
Chandra at the distance of NGC 4945 (1""~18 pc). Accordingly, the Chandra
imaging reveals a resolved, flattened, ~150 pc-long clumpy structure, whose

which appears in almost every theory of supergravity. In this paper, we show
that anomaly mediation really consists of two physically distinct phenomena,
which we dub ""gravitino mediation"" and ""Kahler mediation"". Gravitino mediation
arises from minimally uplifting SUSY anti-de Sitter (AdS) space to Minkowski
space, generating soft masses proportional to the gravitino mass. Kahler
mediation arises when visible sector fields have linear couplings to SUSY
breaking in the Kahler potential, generating soft masses proportional to beta
function coefficients. In the literature, these two phenomena are lumped
together under the name ""anomaly mediation"", but here we demonstrate that they
can be physically disentangled by measuring associated couplings to the
goldstino. In particular, we use the example of gaugino soft masses to show
that gravitino mediation generates soft masses without corresponding goldstino
couplings. This result naively violates the goldstino equivalence theorem but
is in fact necessary for supercurrent conservation in AdS space. Since
gravitino mediation persists even when the visible sector is sequestered from
SUSY breaking, we can use the absence of goldstino couplings as an unambiguous
definition of sequestering.

high resolution simulations of structure formation in different warm dark

gamma-ray emission from UCMHs because the astrometric microlensing signal
produced by an UCMH is maximized if the dark-matter annihilation rate is too

reference spectra of local galaxies for which we have accurate NH information,
as described in Brightman & Nandra. The technique uses two rest-frame hardness
ratios which are optimised for this task, which we designate HR1 (2-4/1-2 keV)
and HR2 (4-16/2-4 keV). The selection method exploits the fact that while
obscured AGN appear hard in HR2 due to absorption of the intrinsic source flux
below ~4 keV, they appear soft in HR1 due to excess emission originating from
scattered source light, thermal emission, or host galaxy emission. Such
emission is ubiquitous in low redshift samples. The technique offers a very
simple and straight forward way of estimating the fraction of obscured AGN in
samples with relatively low signal-to-noise ratio in the X-ray band. We apply
this technique to a moderate redshift (z~1) sample of AGN from the Chandra Deep
Field North, finding that 61% of this sample has NH> 10^23 cm^-2. A clear and
robust conclusion from our analysis, is that in deep surveys the vast majority
of sources do not show hardness ratios consistent with a simple absorbed
power-law. The ubiquity of complex spectra in turn shows that simple hardness
ratio analysis will not yield reliable obscuration estimates, justifying the
more complex colour-colour analysis described in this paper. While this method
does very well at separating sources with NH> 10^23 cm^-2 from sources with
lower NH, only X-ray spectroscopy can identify Compton thick sources, through
the detection of the Fe Ka line. This will be made possible with the high
throughput X-ray spectral capabilities of ATHENA.

ranging from neutrino physics and dark matter searches to the fractional
quantum Hall effect and superconductivity. Despite this long history the
unambiguous observation of Majorana fermions nevertheless remains an
outstanding goal. This review article highlights recent advances in the
condensed matter search for Majorana that have led many in the field to believe
that this quest may soon bear fruit. We begin by introducing in some detail
exotic `topological' one- and two-dimensional superconductors that support
Majorana fermions at their boundaries and at vortices. We then turn to one of
the key insights that arose during the past few years; namely, that it is
possible to `engineer' such exotic superconductors in the laboratory by forming
appropriate heterostructures with ordinary s-wave superconductors. Numerous
proposals of this type are discussed, based on diverse materials such as
topological insulators, conventional semiconductors, ferromagnetic metals, and
many others. The all-important question of how one experimentally detects
Majorana fermions in these setups is then addressed. We focus on three classes
of measurements that provide smoking-gun Majorana signatures: tunneling,
Josephson effects, and interferometry. Finally, we discuss the most remarkable
properties of condensed matter Majorana fermions--the non-Abelian exchange
statistics that they generate and their associated potential for quantum

the value of $N_{f,cr}$ relative to the respective exact results for these

times, speeds and directions of solar transients from outside the Sun-Earth
line. In particular, we are interested in predicting potentially geo-effective
Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections (ICMEs) from observations of density
structures at large observation angles from the Sun (with the STEREO
Heliospheric Imager instrument). We contribute to this endeavor by deriving
analytical formulas concerning a geometric correction for the ICME speed and
arrival time for the technique introduced by Davies et al. (2012, ApJ, in
press) called Self-Similar Expansion Fitting (SSEF). This model assumes that a
circle propagates outward, along a plane specified by a position angle (e.g.
the ecliptic), with constant angular half width (lambda). This is an extension
to earlier, more simple models: Fixed-Phi-Fitting (lambda = 0 degree) and
Harmonic Mean Fitting (lambda = 90 degree). This approach has the advantage
that it is possible to assess clearly, in contrast to previous models, if a
particular location in the heliosphere, such as a planet or spacecraft, might
be expected to be hit by the ICME front. Our correction formulas are especially
significant for glancing hits, where small differences in the direction greatly
influence the expected speeds (up to 100-200 km/s) and arrival times (up to two
days later than the apex). For very wide ICMEs (2 lambda > 120 degree), the
geometric correction becomes very similar to the one derived by M\""ostl et al.
(2011, ApJ, 741, id. 34) for the Harmonic Mean model. These analytic
expressions can also be used for empirical or analytical models to predict the
1 AU arrival time of an ICME by correcting for effects of hits by the flank
rather than the apex, if the width and direction of the ICME in a plane are
known and a circular geometry of the ICME front is assumed.

two combinations of press perturbation experiment. In the first, the top
trophic level was removed by electrical exclusion. In the second configuration,
the top trophic level was still excluded plus a group of species from the
second trophic level was inhibited, also by electrical pulses. Experiments were
repeated at different times to increase confidence in the observed mechanisms.
Community responses indicated the existence of cascading interactions similar
to a classic trophic cascade. The community was composed of Macrobrachium
shrimps at the top trophic level, Ephemeroptera and Chironomidae larval insects
at the second trophic level and periphyton (= epilithon = biofilm) at the first
trophic level. The shrimp exclusion caused an increase in ephemeropterans and
chironomids and led the periphyton to decrease in the exclusion zone. When
ephemeropterans were inhibited together with the exclusion of shrimps, the
chironomids and the periphyton increased. We modelled the community
interactions by means of differential equation systems, simulating the three
configurations: 1. natural condition, 2. shrimp exclusion condition and 3.
shrimp-exclusion-plus-ephemeropteran-inhibition condition. All parameters were
calculated via experimental results and the stability of the models was
determined by their matrix eigenvalues. The models successfully reproduced the
qualitative responses of the community. They proved to have attraction points,
which enables us to predict that the system has some ability to return to its
previous condition after local perturbation.

by differential signature construction based on Cartan's moving frame method. A
similar approach can be used to decide whether a given finite set of ordered

order term of the Zel'dovich power spectrum is built from convolutions of the
linear power spectrum with polynomial kernels in Fourier space, suggesting that
the corresponding term of the the Zel'dovich correlation function can be
written as a sum of quadratic products of a broader class of correlation
functions, expressed through simple spherical Bessel transforms of the linear
power spectrum. We show how to systematically perform such a computation. We
explicitly prove that our result is the Fourier transform of the Zel'dovich
power spectrum, and compare our expressions to numerical simulations. Finally,
we highlight the advantages of writing the nonlinear expansion in configuration
space, as this calculation is easily extended to redshift space, and the higher
order terms are mathematically simpler than their Fourier counterparts.

syntactic fragment of SL, strictly subsuming ATL*, which encompasses formulas
in prenex normal form having a single temporal goal at a time, for every

fluxes threading the loop. It is thus possible to vary the inductance of the
ring with flux while retaining a strong, dissipation-free, and noiseless
non-linearity. The device has been operated in amplifier mode and its noise
performance has been evaluated by using the noise spectrum emitted by a voltage
biased tunnel junction at finite frequency as a test signal. The unprecedented
accuracy with which the crossover between zero-point-fluctuations and shot
noise has been measured provides an upper-bound for the noise and dissipation
intrinsic to the device.

multiple bits per cell and achieve high storage densities. Higher densities
cause increased raw bit error rates (BERs), which demand powerful error
correcting codes. Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a well-known class
of capacity-approaching codes in AWGN channels. However, LDPC codes
traditionally use soft information while the flash read channel provides only
hard information. Low resolution soft information may be obtained by performing
multiple reads per cell with distinct word-line voltages.
  We select the values of these word-line voltages to maximize the mutual
information between the input and output of the equivalent multiple-read
channel under any specified noise model. Our results show that maximum
mutual-information (MMI) quantization provides better soft information for LDPC
decoding given the quantization level than the constant-pdf-ratio quantization
approach. We also show that adjusting the LDPC code degree distribution for the
quantized setting provides a significant performance improvement.

present a novel algorithm for the SCP that: (i) is asymptotically optimal,
i.e., it produces, almost surely, a solution approaching the optimal one as the
number of pickups/deliveries goes to infinity; and (ii) has computational
complexity $O(n^{2+\eps})$, where $n$ is the number of pickup/delivery pairs

characterize the length of the optimal SCP tour. Finally, we study a dynamic

Poisson process, and which serves as a model for large-scale demand-responsive
transport (DRT) systems. For such a dynamic counterpart of the SCP, we derive a
necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of stable vehicle routing
policies, which depends only on the workspace geometry, the stochastic
distributions of pickup and delivery points, the arrival rate of requests, and
the number of vehicles. Our results leverage a novel connection between the

proposing a novel energy efficient semi-static power control and link

proposed scheme can determine the most energy efficient MCS level and transmit
power at the Node B. And then the Node B configure the optimal MCS level and
transmit power. In order to decrease the signaling overhead caused by the
configuration, a dual trigger mechanism is employed. After that, we extend the
proposed scheme to the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) scenarios.
Simulation results confirm the significant EE improvement of our proposed

the energy efficient mode switching between single input multiple output (SIMO)

efficiently depletes grains with radii $a\la 0.001 \micron$ on a time-scale of

a similar time-scale, but accretion is more efficient in producing a large bump
in the grain size distribution. Coagulation further pushes the grains to larger
sizes after a major part of the gas phase metals are used up. Similar grain
sizes are achieved by coagulation regardless of whether accretion takes place
or not; in this sense, accretion and coagulation modify the grain size
distribution independently. The increase of the total dust mass in a cloud is
also investigated. We show that coagulation slightly 'suppresses' dust mass
growth by accretion but that this effect is slight enough to be neglected in
considering the grain mass budget in galaxies. Finally we examine how accretion

verifiable computation has grown increasingly urgent. The concept of verifiable
computation enables a weak client to outsource difficult computations to a
powerful, but untrusted, server. Protocols for verifiable computation aim to
provide the client with a guarantee that the server performed the requested
computations correctly, without requiring the client to perform the
computations herself. By design, these protocols impose a minimal computational
burden on the client. However, existing protocols require the server to perform
a large amount of extra bookkeeping in order to enable a client to easily
verify the results. Verifiable computation has thus remained a theoretical
curiosity, and protocols for it have not been implemented in real cloud
computing systems.
  Our goal is to leverage GPUs to reduce the server-side slowdown for
verifiable computation. To this end, we identify abundant data parallelism in a
state-of-the-art general-purpose protocol for verifiable computation,
originally due to Goldwasser, Kalai, and Rothblum, and recently extended by
Cormode, Mitzenmacher, and Thaler. We implement this protocol on the GPU,
obtaining 40-120x server-side speedups relative to a state-of-the-art
sequential implementation. For benchmark problems, our implementation reduces
the slowdown of the server to factors of 100-500x relative to the original
computations requested by the client. Furthermore, we reduce the already small
runtime of the client by 100x. Similarly, we obtain 20-50x server-side and
client-side speedups for related protocols targeted at specific streaming
problems. We believe our results demonstrate the immediate practicality of
using GPUs for verifiable computation, and more generally that protocols for
verifiable computation have become sufficiently mature to deploy in real cloud
computing systems.

result suggests the optical flux is dominated by afterglow. Our further

forming a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, and shares almost every remarkable
property with graphene. A new feature is its buckled structure, due to which
the band structure can be controlled externally by changing $E_z$. The low
energy physics of silicene is described by massive Dirac fermions, where the
mass is a function of $E_z$ and becomes zero at the critical field
$E_{\text{cr}}$. We show that there are no zero energy states due to the Dirac

is shown that the 4-fold degenerate zero-energy states are completely resolved

amino acid sequence of a protein determines its native structure and the native
structure has the minimum Gibbs free energy. If all chemical problems can be
answered by quantum mechanics, there should be a quantum mechanics derivation
of Gibbs free energy formula G(X) for every possible conformation X of the
protein. We apply quantum statistics to derive such a formula. For simplicity,
only monomeric self folding globular proteins are covered. We point out some
immediate applications of the formula. We show that the formula explains the
observed phenomena very well. It gives a unified explanation to both folding
and denaturation; it explains why hydrophobic effect is the driving force of
protein folding and clarifies the role played by hydrogen bonding; it explains
the successes and deficients of various surface area models. The formula also
gives a clear kinetic force of the folding: Fi(X) = - \nablaxi G(X). This also
gives a natural way to perform the ab initio prediction of protein structure,
minimizing G(X) by Newton's fastest desciending method.

only in studies of cluster physics, but also for probes of cosmology. However,
different mass measurement techniques frequently yield discrepant results. The
SDSS MaxBCG catalog's mass-richness relation has previously been constrained
using weak lensing shear, Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ), and X-ray measurements. The
mass normalization of the clusters as measured by weak lensing shear is >~25%
higher than that measured using SZ and X-ray methods, a difference much larger
than the stated measurement errors in the analyses. We constrain the
mass-richness relation of the MaxBCG galaxy cluster catalog by measuring the
gravitational lensing magnification of type I quasars in the background of the
clusters. The magnification is determined using the quasars' variability and
the correlation between quasars' variability amplitude and intrinsic
luminosity. The mass-richness relation determined through magnification is in
agreement with that measured using shear, confirming that the lensing strength
of the clusters implies a high mass normalization, and that the discrepancy
with other methods is not due to a shear-related systematic measurement error.
We study the dependence of the measured mass normalization on the cluster halo
orientation. As expected, line-of-sight clusters yield a higher normalization;
however, this minority of haloes does not significantly bias the average
mass-richness relation of the catalog.

are highly dependent on the level of the line profile. Hence, analyses of the
variation of the spectroscopic lines of roAp stars potentially provide us with
new information about the vertical structure of the atmosphere of these stars.
In order to extract such information, a numerical simulation of the
line-profile variation beyond a single-surface approximation is necessary. We
carried out a numerical simulation of line-profile variation by taking account
of the finite thickness of the line forming layer. We demonstrated how
effective this treatment is, by comparing the simulation with the observed line
profiles.

simpler to use in practice. Our simplifications relate to the non-interacting
part of the CM equations, and primarily refer to practical implementations in
which the groundstate stress tensor is approximated by its Kohn-Sham version.
We use the simplified approach to directly prove the exactness of CM for
one-electron systems via an orthonormal formulation. This proof sheds light on
certain physical considerations contained in the CM theory and their
implication on CM-based approximations. The one-electron proof then motivates
an approximation to the CM (exact under certain conditions) expanded on the
wavefunctions of the Kohn-Sham (KS) equations. Particular attention is paid to
the relationships between transitions from occupied to unoccupied KS orbitals
and their approximations under the CM. We also demonstrate the simplified CM
semi-analytically on an example system.

emissivity in strong magnetic fields. While five-minute oscillations are the

of the spectral models. In close WR+O binaries, X-rays likely originate in
colliding stellar wind (CSW) shocks driven by the massive winds of the binary

high density of the plasma in the interaction region. Opposite to this, our
analysis shows that the CSW shocks in the sample of close WR+O binaries are
adiabatic. This is possible only if the mass-loss rates of the stellar
components in the binary are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the
values currently accepted. The most likely explanation for the X-ray properties

Boundary Explorer (IBEX) is determined based on IBEX-Lo Star Sensor
observations. Accurate information on the boresight of the neutral gas camera
is essential for precise determination of interstellar gas flow parameters.
Utilizing spin-phase information from the spacecraft attitude control system
(ACS), positions of stars observed by the Star Sensor during two years of IBEX
measurements were analyzed and compared with positions obtained from a star
catalog. No statistically significant differences were observed beyond those
expected from the pre-launch uncertainty in the Star Sensor mounting. Based on
the star observations and their positions in the spacecraft reference system,
pointing of the IBEX satellite spin axis was determined and compared with the
pointing obtained from the ACS. Again, no statistically significant deviations
were observed. We conclude that no systematic correction for boresight geometry
is needed in the analysis of IBEX-Lo observations to determine neutral
interstellar gas flow properties. A stack-up of uncertainties in attitude
knowledge shows that the instantaneous IBEX-Lo pointing is determined to within
$\sim 0.1\degr$ in both spin angle and elevation using either the Star Sensor
or the ACS. Further, the Star Sensor can be used to independently determine the
spacecraft spin axis. Thus, Star Sensor data can be used reliably to correct
the spin phase when the Star Tracker (used by the ACS) is disabled by bright
objects in its field-of-view. The Star Sensor can also determine the spin axis
during most orbits and thus provides redundancy for the Star Tracker.

solid samples. The decoupled mass with polycrystals is much smaller, $\sim$ 1%,
similar to what is observed by other groups. In particular, we compared the
properties of samples grown with the TO's rotation axis at different
orientations with respect to gravity. We found that the decoupled mass fraction
of bcc samples is independent of the angle between the rotation axis and

be avoided in some special circumstances, and there may exist an oscillating
universe or a bouncing one. If the cosmic scale factor is in the oscillating
region initially, the universe may undergo an oscillation. After a number of
oscillations, it may evolve to the bounce point through quantum tunneling and
then expand. However, if the universe contracts initially from an infinite
scale, it can turn around and then expand forever. In the vacuum energy
dominated case, there exists a stable Einstein static state to avoid the big
bang singularity. However, in certain circumstances in the matter or vacuum
energy dominated case, a new kind of singularity may occur at $a_0$ as a result
of the discontinuity of the scale factor. In the radiation dominated case, the
universe may originate from the big bang singularity, but a bouncing universe

test liquid from experimentally measured terminal velocity of a ball falling in
the test liquid contained in a narrow tube is described. The calculation
requires the value of a multiplicative correction factor to the apparent
coefficient of viscosity calculated by substitution of terminal velocity of the
falling ball in Stokes formula. This correction factor, the so-called viscosity
ratio, a measure of deviation from Stokes limit, arises from non-vanishing
values of the Reynolds number and the ball/tube radius ratio. The method, valid
over a very wide range of Reynolds number, is based on the recognition of a
relationship between two measures of wall effect, the more widely investigated
velocity ratio, defined as the ratio of terminal velocity in a confined medium
to that in a boundless medium and viscosity ratio. The calculation uses two
recently published correlation formulae based on extensive experimental results
on terminal velocity of a falling ball. The first formula relates velocity
ratio to Reynolds number and ball-tube radius ratio. The second formula gives
an expression of the ratio of the drag force actually sensed by the ball
falling in an infinite medium to that in the Stokes limit as a function of
Reynolds number alone. It is shown that appropriate use of this correction
factor extends the utility of the technique of falling ball viscometry beyond
the very low Reynolds number 'creepy flow' regime, to which its application is
presently restricted. Issues related to accuracy are examined by use of our own
measurements of the terminal velocity of a falling ball in a narrow tube and
that of published literature reports, on liquids of known viscosity
coefficient.

density function for the number of particle trajectories, relative to which the

  The conditions for reasonableness of trajectory interpretation of pRQM are
discussed. On basis of analysis of a general formalism for vacuum-flavor mixing
of neutrino within the context of the standard and pRQM models we show that the
corresponding expressions for the probability of transition from one neutrino
flavor to another differ appreciably, but they are experimentally testable: the
estimations of absolute value for neutrino mass based on modern experimental

preference. It is noted that the selection criterion of mass solutions relies
on proximity between the average size of condensed neutrino clouds, which is

decision problems are effectively encoded into Satisfiability Modulo Theories
(SMT). In the last decade efficient SMT solvers have been developed for several
theories of practical interest (e.g., linear arithmetic, arrays, bit-vectors).
Surprisingly, very few work has been done to extend SMT to deal with
optimization problems; in particular, we are not aware of any work on SMT
solvers able to produce solutions which minimize cost functions over
arithmetical variables. This is unfortunate, since some problems of interest
require this functionality.
  In this paper we start filling this gap. We present and discuss two general
procedures for leveraging SMT to handle the minimization of LA(Q) cost
functions, combining SMT with standard minimization techniques. We have
implemented the proposed approach within the MathSAT SMT solver. Due to the
lack of competitors in AR and SMT domains, we experimentally evaluated our
implementation against state-of-the-art tools for the domain of linear
generalized disjunctive programming (LGDP), which is closest in spirit to our
domain, on sets of problems which have been previously proposed as benchmarks
for the latter tools. The results show that our tool is very competitive with,
and often outperforms, these tools on these problems, clearly demonstrating the
potential of the approach.

observed with PACS and SPIRE in parallel mode between 70 um and 500 um over an
area of about 3 square degrees. A photometric catalogue has been extracted from
the detections in each band, using a threshold of 5 sigma over the local
background. Out of this catalogue we have selected a robust sub-sample of 268
sources, of which 75% are cloud clumps and 25% are cores. Their Spectral Energy
Distributions (SEDs) have been fitted with a modified black body function. We
classify 48 sources as protostellar and 218 as starless. For two further
sources, we do not provide a secure classification, but suggest they are Class
0 protostars.
  From SED fitting we have derived key physical parameters. Protostellar
sources are in general warmer and more compact than starless sources. Both
these evidences can be ascribed to the presence of an internal source(s) of
moderate heating, which also causes a temperature gradient and hence a more
peaked intensity distribution. Moreover, the reduced dimensions of protostellar
sources may indicate that they will not fragment further. A virial analysis of
the starless sources gives an upper limit of 90% for the sources
gravitationally bound and therefore prestellar. We fit a power law N(logM) prop
M^-1.1 to the linear portion of the mass distribution of prestellar sources.
This is in between that typical of CO clumps and those of cores in nearby
star-forming regions. We interpret this as a result of the inhomogeneity of our
sample, which is composed of comparable fractions of clumps and cores.

parameters, chemical order degree, grain sizes and crystallographic texture,
carried out on FePd alloys with 10 at.% of Cu addition. The initial [Cu(0.2
nm)/Fe(0.9 nm)/Pd(1.1 nm)]x5 multilayers were thermally evaporated in an
ultra-high vacuum on MgO(100), Si(100), Si(111) and Si(100) covered by 100 nm
thick layer of amorphous SiO2. In order to obtain homogeneous FePd:Cu alloy,
the multilayers were annealed in two different ways. First, the samples were
rapidly annealed in nitrogen atmosphere at 600oC for 90 seconds. Next, the long
annealing in a high vacuum for 1 hour at 700oC was done. This paper focuses on
quantitative investigations of the chemical order degree and crystallographic
texture of ternary FePd:Cu alloys deposited on four different substrates. In
order to obtain both quantities we have taken a novel approach to consider the
problem of dopant atoms located in the FePd structure. The studies of the
structure were done using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) performed with synchrotron
radiation and pole figures measurements. We have found that the addition of Cu
changes the FePd lattice parameters and lattice distortion. We have also shown,
that using different substrates it is possible to obtain a FePd:Cu alloy with
different chemical order and texture. Moreover, it was observed that texture
category is substrate dependent.

measurement scheme. The paper reveals the inherent relationship of the
unambiguous measurement range (UMR), the outlier probability, the MSE
performance with the frequency pattern in MFI system, and then provides the
corresponding criterion for choosing the frequency pattern. We point out that
the theoretical rigorous UMR of MFI deduced in the literature is usually
optimistic for practical application and derive a more practical expression .
It is found that the least-square (LS) estimator of MFI has a distinguished
""double threshold effect"". Distinct difference is observed for the MSE in
moderate and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region (denoted by MMSE and HMSE
respectively) and the second threshold effect occurs during the rapid
transition from MMSE to HMSE with increasing SNR. The closed-form expressions
for the MMSE, HMSE and Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) are further derived, with HMSE
coinciding with CRB. Since the HMSE is insensitive to frequency pattern, we
focus on MMSE minimization by proper frequency optimization. We show that a
prime-based frequency interval can be exploited for the purpose of both outlier
suppression and UMR extension and design a special optimal rearrangement for
any set of frequency interval, in the sense of MMSE minimization. An extremely
simple frequency design method is finally developed. Simulation and field
experiment verified that the proposed scheme considerably outperforms the
existing method in UMR as well as MSE performance, especially in the transition
from MMSE to HMSE, for Gaussian and non-Gaussian channel.

steps are usually performed separately: detection of brain activity and
estimation of the hemodynamic response. Because these two steps are inherently
linked, we adopt the so-called region-based Joint Detection-Estimation (JDE)
framework that addresses this joint issue using a multivariate inference for
detection and estimation. JDE is built by making use of a regional bilinear
generative model of the BOLD response and constraining the parameter estimation
by physiological priors using temporal and spatial information in a Markovian
modeling. In contrast to previous works that use Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) techniques to approximate the resulting intractable posterior
distribution, we recast the JDE into a missing data framework and derive a
Variational Expectation-Maximization (VEM) algorithm for its inference. A
variational approximation is used to approximate the Markovian model in the
unsupervised spatially adaptive JDE inference, which allows fine automatic
tuning of spatial regularisation parameters. It follows a new algorithm that
exhibits interesting properties compared to the previously used MCMC-based
approach. Experiments on artificial and real data show that VEM-JDE is robust
to model mis-specification and provides computational gain while maintaining
good performance in terms of activation detection and hemodynamic shape
recovery.

develop, first, a stochastic model for the competing processes of merging and
secular evolution in the early Universe; and second, through an ABC-based

most efficient of contemporary approaches to this important statistical

careful summary statistic selection, and demonstrate two modern strategies for
assessment and optimisation in this regard. Ultimately, our ABC analysis of the
high redshift morphological mix returns tight constraints on the evolving
merger rate in the early Universe and favours major merging (with disc survival

cross helicity at the solar surface, magnetoconvection under the presence of a
vertical large-scale magnetic field is simulated with the nonlinear MHD code
NIRVANA. The very robust result of the calculations is that < u_z b_z >\simeq 2

correlation coefficient for the cross helicity is about 10%. Of similar
robustness is the finding that the rms value of the magnetic perturbations
exceeds the mean-field amplitude (only) by a factor of five. The characteristic
helicity speed u_{\eta} as the ratio of the eddy diffusivity and the density
scale height for an isothermal sound velocity of 6.6 km/s proves to be 1 km/s
for weak fields. This value well coincides with empirical results obtained from
the data of the HINODE satellite and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST)

prove that, firstly, the unique viscosity solution $V(t,x)$ of such a HJB

terminal condition at time $T$, is jointly Lipschitz in $(t,x)$, for $t$

high detection rate of X-ray afterglows by swift/XRT and its localization
precision of 2-3 arcsec facilitates the identification and study of GRB host
galaxies. We focus on the search for the host galaxies of a sample of 17 bursts
with XRT error circles but no detected long-wavelength afterglow. Three of
these events can also be classified as truly dark bursts: the observed upper
limit on the optical flux of the afterglow was less than expected based on the
X-ray flux. Our study is based on deep R and K-band observations performed with
ESO/VLT instruments, supported by GROND and NEWFIRM. To be conservative, we
searched for host galaxies in an area with a radius twice the 90% swift/XRT
error circle. For 15 of the 17 bursts we find at least one galaxy inside the
doubled XRT error circle. In seven cases we discover extremely red objects in
the error circles. The most remarkable case is the host of GRB 080207 which as
a colour of R-K~4.7 mag (AB), one of the reddest galaxies ever associated with
a GRB. As a by-product of our study we identify the optical afterglow of GRB
070517A. Optically dim afterglows result from cosmological Lyman drop out and
dust extinction, but the former process is only equired for a minority of cases
(<1/3). Extinction by dust in the host galaxies might explain all other events.
Thereby, a seemingly non-negligible fraction of these hosts are globally
dust-enshrouded, extremely red galaxies. This suggests that bursts with
optically dim afterglows trace a subpopulation of massive starburst galaxies,
which are markedly different from the main body of the GRB host galaxy
population, namely the blue, subluminous, compact galaxies.

spatial profiles of the detected beams as well as losses of single photons from
a pair are taken into account in a developed general theory of photon-number
detection. The measured data provided by an iCCD camera with single-photon
detection sensitivity are analyzed along the developed theory. Joint
signal-idler photon-number distributions are recovered using the reconstruction
method based on the principle of maximum likelihood. The range of applicability
of the method is discussed. The reconstructed joint signal-idler photon-number
distribution is compared with that obtained by a method that uses superposition
of signal and noise and minimizes photoelectron entropy. Statistics of the
reconstructed fields are identified to be multi-mode Gaussian. Elements of the
measured as well as the reconstructed joint signal-idler photon-number
distributions violate classical inequalities. Sub-shot-noise correlations in
the difference of the signal and idler photon numbers as well as partial
suppression of odd elements in the distribution of the sum of signal and idler
photon numbers are observed.

monolayer graphene, we find that a moderate magnetic field can lead to a strong

which arises due to the SL induced dispersion of the zero energy Landau levels.
This effect may find useful applications in switching or other devices. For
bilayer graphene, we discuss the structure of Landau level wave functions and
local density of states in the presence of a uniform bias, as well as in the
presence of a kink in the bias which leads to topologically bound `edge

is an urgent need to understand the threat from 'black swan' extreme events
that might emerge. On 6 May 2010, it took just five minutes for a spontaneous
mix of human and machine interactions in the global trading cyberspace to
generate an unprecedented system-wide Flash Crash. However, little is known
about what lies ahead in the crucial sub-second regime where humans become
unable to respond or intervene sufficiently quickly. Here we analyze a set of
18,520 ultrafast black swan events that we have uncovered in stock-price
movements between 2006 and 2011. We provide empirical evidence for, and an
accompanying theory of, an abrupt system-wide transition from a mixed
human-machine phase to a new all-machine phase characterized by frequent black
swan events with ultrafast durations (<650ms for crashes, <950ms for spikes).
Our theory quantifies the systemic fluctuations in these two distinct phases in
terms of the diversity of the system's internal ecology and the amount of
global information being processed. Our finding that the ten most susceptible
entities are major international banks, hints at a hidden relationship between
these ultrafast 'fractures' and the slow 'breaking' of the global financial
system post-2006. More generally, our work provides tools to help predict and
mitigate the systemic risk developing in any complex socio-technical system
that attempts to operate at, or beyond, the limits of human response times.

warm gas traced by far-infrared (FIR) lines with unprecedented detail. The
rotational diagram of the high-Jup CO lines indicates high-excitation
conditions (Tex ~ 210 +/- 10 K). We used a radiative transfer code to model the
hot CO gas emission observed with PACS and in the CO (13-12) and (10-9) lines
measured by Herschel-HIFI. We derive 200<Tkin<800 K and n>10^5 cm-3. The CO
emission comes from a region of about 7 arcsec located at the rear of the bow
shock where the [OI] and OH emission also originate. Comparison with shock
models shows that the bright [OI] and OH emissions trace a dissociative J-type
shock, which is also supported by a previous detection of [FeII] at the same
position. The inferred mass-flux is consistent with the ""reverse"" shock where
