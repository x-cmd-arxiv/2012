Our analysis, based on the light curve alone, enables us to constrain the mass
of the KOI-13.01 companion to be $M_{\rm C} = 8.3 \pm 1.25M_{\rm J}$ and thus
demonstrates that the transiting companion is a planet (rather than a brown
dwarf which was recently proposed by \cite{b7}). The high temperature of the
host star (Spectral Type A5-7V, $T_{\rm eff} = 8511-8020$ K), combined with the
proximity of its companion KOI-13.01, may make it one of the hottest exoplanets
known, with a detectable thermal contribution to the light curve even in the
Kepler optical passband. However, the single passband of the Kepler light curve
does not enable us to unambiguously distinguish between the thermal and
reflected components of the planetary emission. Infrared observations may help
to break the degeneracy, while radial velocity follow-up with $\sigma \sim$ 100
m s$^{-1}$ precision should confirm the mass of the planet.

-265 km/s, and with a corresponding H2 mass of 2*10^7 M_sun, was detected ~10
kpc southeast of the nucleus of M86, near the peak of its HI emission. We argue
that it is possible for this molecular gas either to have formed in situ from

the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) as seen from the \textit{Chandra} X-ray
Observatory. This object is in a class of composite remnants that exhibit a
shell of emission surrounding a central plerion, more commonly known as a
pulsar wind nebula (PWN). This is one of only five remnants in the LMC with an
identified PWN. We find that the shell of emission is not ejecta dominated, but
rather due to shocked ISM that has been swept up by the supernova blast wave or
located in a precursor cavity wall. This is supported by the morphology of the
local molecular cloud as seen with the \textit{Spitzer} Space Telescope. The
spectral properties are consistent with a middle-aged remnant $>$17000 years
old. A point source detected within the central knot is determined to be the
pulsar powering the synchrotron emission of the PWN. Spectral fits show the
nebula is well characterized by a power law with photon index $\Gamma=2.0$.
This index is constant over a spatial scale of 0.4-1.2 pc, which is
inconsistent with younger PWN containing remnants such as the Crab Nebula and
SNR 0540-69.3. These fits also contain significant contributions from an ejecta
dominated thermal plasma which we interpret as evidence of mixing during an
evolved interaction of the PWN with the reverse shock of the SNR. We observe no
evidence that the central pulsar contains a significant velocity transverse to
the line of sight and argue that despite the asymmetric surface brightness
distribution the SN explosion giving birth to this remnant may have been quite
symmetric.

spreads, given only the times when each node gets infected. While this is a
problem of importance in several contexts -- offline and online social
networks, e-commerce, epidemiology, vulnerabilities in infrastructure networks
-- there has been very little work, analytical or empirical, on finding the
graph. Clearly, it is impossible to do so from just one cascade; our interest
is in learning the graph from a small number of cascades.
  For the classic and popular ""independent cascade"" SIR epidemics, we
analytically establish the number of cascades required by both the global
maximum-likelihood (ML) estimator, and a natural greedy algorithm. Both results
are based on a key observation: the global graph learning problem decouples
into $n$ local problems -- one for each node. For a node of degree $d$, we show
that its neighborhood can be reliably found once it has been infected $O(d^2
\log n)$ times (for ML on general graphs) or $O(d\log n)$ times (for greedy on
trees). We also provide a corresponding information-theoretic lower bound of
$\Omega(d\log n)$; thus our bounds are essentially tight. Furthermore, if we
are given side-information in the form of a super-graph of the actual graph (as
is often the case), then the number of cascade samples required -- in all cases
-- becomes independent of the network size $n$.
  Finally, we show that for a very general SIR epidemic cascade model, the
Markov graph of infection times is obtained via the moralization of the network
graph.

as one of the most promising candidates to build up a true universal memory
thanks to its fast write/read speed, infinite endurance and non-volatility.
However the conventional access architecture based on 1 transistor + 1 memory
cell limits its storage density as the selection transistor should be large
enough to ensure the write current higher than the critical current for the STT
operation. This paper describes a design of cross-point architecture for
STT-MRAM. The mean area per word corresponds to only two transistors, which are
shared by a number of bits (e.g. 64). This leads to significant improvement of
data density (e.g. 1.75 F2/bit). Special techniques are also presented to
address the sneak currents and low speed issues of conventional cross-point
architecture, which are difficult to surmount and few efficient design
solutions have been reported in the literature. By using a STT-MRAM SPICE model
including precise experimental parameters and STMicroelectronics 65 nm
technology, some chip characteristic results such as cell area, data access

During 15 February 2011 a X-2.2 class flare occurred in NOAA 11158, a
$\beta\gamma\delta$ sunspot complex. We identify three distinct phases of the
coronal loop dynamics during this event: (i) {\it Slow rise phase}: slow rising
motion of the loop-tops prior to the flare in response to slow rise of the
underlying flux rope, (ii) {\it Collapse phase}: sudden contraction of the
loop-tops with lower loops collapsing earlier than the higher loops, and (iii)
{\it Oscillation phase}: the loops exhibit global kink oscillations after the
collapse phase at different periods, with period decreasing with decreasing
height of the loops. The period of these loop oscillations is used to estimate
the field strength in the coronal loops of different loop lengths in this
active region. Further, we also use SDO/HMI observations to study the
photospheric changes close to the polarity inversion line (PIL). The
longitudinal magnetograms show step-wise permanent decrease in the magnetic
flux after the flare over a coherent patch along the PIL. Further, we examine
the HMI Stokes I,Q,U,V profiles over this patch and find that the Stokes-V
signal systematically decreases while the Stokes-Q and U signal increases after
the flare. These observations suggest that close to the PIL the field
configuration became more horizontal after the flare. We also use HMI vector
magnetic field observations to quantify the changes in the field inclination
angle and found an inward collapse of the field lines towards the polarity
inversion line (PIL) by $\sim$ 10$^\circ$. These observations are consistent
with the ""coronal implosion"" scenario and its predictions about flare related
photospheric field changes.

the non-null mean radial motion toward the Galactic anticenter found by other

motion of the LSR alone cannot explain these observations. The rotational
velocity decreases with |Z| by -30 km/s/kpc, but the data are better
represented by a power-law with index 1.25, similar to that proposed from the
analysis of SDSS data. All the velocity dispersions increase with |Z|, but the
vertical gradients are small. The dispersions grow proportionally, with no
significant variation of the anisotropy. The ratio sigma_U/sigma_W=2 suggests
that the thick disk could have formed from a low-latitude merging event. The
vertex deviation increases with Galactic height, reaching ~20 degrees at
|Z|=3.5 kpc. The tilt angle also increases, and the orientation of the
ellipsoid in the radial-vertical plane is constantly intermediate between the
alignment with the cylindrical and the spherical coordinate systems. The tilt
angle at |Z|=2 kpc coincides with the expectations of MOND, but an extension of
the calculations to higher |Z| is required to perform a conclusive test.

FGK companions with known metallicities. The H-band and K-band calibrations
provide equivalent fits to the metallicities of these binaries, with an
accuracy of +/- 0.12 dex. We derive the first empirically calibrated
spectroscopic metallicity estimate for the giant planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 317,
confirming its super-solar metallicity. Combining this result with observations
of eight other M dwarf planet hosts, we find that M dwarfs with giant planets
are preferentially metal-rich compared to those that host less massive planets.
Our H-band calibration relies on strongly metallicity-dependent features in the
H-band, which will be useful in compositional studies using mid to high

  Although coding schemes for correlated data have been studied extensively,
the focus has been on characterizing the rate region in static memory-free

time required until nodes can successfully decode. While Gossip schemes are
practical, distributed and scalable, they have only been studied for
uncorrelated data.

gossip in (dynamic) networks with correlated data. We give a clean framework

continuum have measured spectral indices values which are significantly lower
than what is found in the diffuse interstellar medium. Under the assumption
that mm-wave emission of disks is mostly optically thin, these data have been
generally interpreted as evidence for the presence of mm/cm-sized pebbles in
the disk outer regions. In this work we investigate the effect of possible
local optically thick regions on the mm-wave emission of protoplanetary disks
without mm/cm-sized grains. A significant local increase of the optical depth
in the disk can be caused by the concentration of solid particles, as predicted
to result from a variety of proposed physical mechanisms. We calculate the
filling factors and implied overdensities these optically thick regions would
need to significantly affect the millimeter fluxes of disks, and we discuss
their plausibility. We find that optically thick regions characterized by
relatively small filling factors can reproduce the mm-data of young disks
without requesting emission from mm/cm-sized pebbles. However, these optically
thick regions require dust overdensities much larger than what predicted by any
of the physical processes proposed in the literature to drive the concentration
of solids. We find that only for the most massive disks it is possible and
plausible to imagine that the presence of optically thick regions in the disk
is responsible for the low measured values of the mm spectral index. For the
majority of the disk population, optically thin emission from a population of
large mm-sized grains remains the most plausible explanation. The results of
this analysis further strengthen the scenario for which the measured low
spectral indices of protoplanetary disks at mm wavelengths are due to the
presence of large mm/cm-sized pebbles in the disk outer regions.

(Paper\,I), by focusing on the influence of their average ISM properties on the
total molecular gas mass estimates via the so-called X_{co}=M(H_2)/L_{co,1-0}
factor. One-phase radiative transfer models of the global CO Spectral Line
Energy Distributions (SLEDs) yield an X_{co} distribution with:
<X_{co}>\sim(0.6+/-0.2) M_{sol}(K km s^{-1} pc^2)^{-1} over a significant range
of average gas densities, temperatures and dynamical states. The latter emerges
as the most important parameter in determining X_{co}, with unbound states
yielding low values and self-gravitating states the highest ones. Nevertheless
in many (U)LIRGs where available higher-J CO lines (J=3--2, 4--3, and/or
J=6--5) or HCN line data from the literature allow a separate assessment of the
gas mass at high densities (>=10^{4} cm^{-3}) rather than a simple one-phase
analysis we find that {\it near-Galactic X_{co} (3-6)\,
M_sol\,(K\,km^{-1}\,pc^2)^{-1} values become possible.} We further show that in
the highly turbulent molecular gas in ULIRGs a high-density component will be
common and can be massive enough for its high X_{co} to dominate the average
value for the entire galaxy. .........
  ...this may have thus resulted to systematic underestimates of molecular gas
mass in ULIRGs.

on matrix product states. The virtual parallelization is accomplished by
representing bits with matrices and by evolving these matrices from an initial
product state that encodes multiple inputs. Matrix evolution follows from the
sequential application of gates, as in a logical circuit. The action by
classical probabilistic one-bit and deterministic two-bit gates such as NAND
are implemented in terms of matrix operations and, as opposed to quantum
computing, it is possible to copy bits. We present a way to explore this method
of computation to solve search problems and count the number of solutions. We
argue that if the classical computational cost of testing solutions (witnesses)
requires less than $O(n^2)$ local two-bit gates acting on $n$ bits, the search
problem can be fully solved in subexponential time. Therefore, for this
restricted type of search problem, the virtual parallelization scheme is faster
than Grover's quantum algorithm

greater than or equal to the dimension divided by two, a fundamental solution
for the polyharmonic equation has logarithmic behavior. We give two approaches

The first approach is algebraic and relies upon the construction of
two-parameter polynomials. We describe some of the properties of these
polynomials, and use them to derive the Fourier expansion for a logarithmic
fundamental solution of the polyharmonic equation. The second approach depends
on the computation of parameter derivatives of Fourier series for a power-law

canonical (Liouville) measure on the space of solutions. In ordinary
statistical physics, the Liouville measure is used to compute probabilities of
macrostates, and it would seem natural to use the similar measure arising in
general relativity to compute probabilities in cosmology, such as the
probability that the universe underwent an era of inflation. Indeed, a number
of authors have used the restriction of this measure to the space of
homogeneous and isotropic universes with scalar field matter
(minisuperspace)---namely, the Gibbons-Hawking-Stewart measure---to make
arguments about the likelihood of inflation. We argue here that there are at
least four major difficulties with using the measure of general relativity to
make probability arguments in cosmology: (1) Equilibration does not occur on
cosmological length scales. (2) Even in the minisuperspace case, the measure of
phase space is infinite and the computation of probabilities depends very
strongly on how the infinity is regulated. (3) The inhomogeneous degrees of
freedom must be taken into account (we illustrate how) even if one is
interested only in universes that are very nearly homogeneous. The measure
depends upon how the infinite number of degrees of freedom are truncated, and
how one defines ""nearly homogeneous."" (4) In a universe where the second law of
thermodynamics holds, one cannot make use of our knowledge of the present state
of the universe to ""retrodict"" the likelihood of past conditions.

stellar continuum emission for a sample of 57 galaxies with rest-frame Halpha
equivalent widths >100 Angstroms in the 3D-HST grism survey. We find that the
Halpha emission broadly follows the rest-frame R-band light but that it is
typically somewhat more extended and clumpy. We quantify the spatial
distribution with the half-light radius. The median Halpha effective radius
r_e(Halpha) is 4.2+-0.1 kpc but the sizes span a large range, from compact
objects with r_e(Halpha) ~ 1.0 kpc to extended disks with r_e(Halpha) ~ 15 kpc.
Comparing Halpha sizes to continuum sizes, we find
<r_e(Halpha)/r_e(R)>=1.3+-0.1 for the full sample. That is, star formation, as
traced by Halpha, typically occurs out to larger radii than the rest-frame
R-band stellar continuum; galaxies are growing their radii and building up from
the inside out. This effect appears to be somewhat more pronounced for the
largest galaxies. Using the measured Halpha sizes, we derive star formation
rate surface densities. We find that they range from ~0.05 Msun yr^{-1}
kpc^{-2} for the largest galaxies to ~5 Msun yr^{-1} kpc^{-2} for the smallest
galaxies, implying a large range in physical conditions in rapidly star-forming
z~1 galaxies. Finally, we infer that all galaxies in the sample have very high
gas mass fractions and stellar mass doubling times < 500 Myr. Although other
explanations are also possible, a straightforward interpretation is that we are
simultaneously witnessing the rapid formation of compact bulges and large disks
at z~1.

magnetically coupled to the electronic spin of a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV)

is achieved by synchronizing pulsed spin-addressing protocols (involving
optical and radiofrequency fields) to the motion of the driven oscillator,
which allows coherent mechanical manipulation of both the population and phase

demonstrate applications of this coherent mechanical spin-control technique to

later core collapse supernovae. Thus, constraining the near-core conditions in
this class of stars can place tighter constraints on the size, mass and
chemical composition of supernova remnants. Asteroseismology of these massive
stars is one possible approach into such investigations. Recently, Moravveji et
al. (2012, hereafter Paper I) extracted 19 significant frequencies from a
6-year radial velocity monitoring or Rigel (\beta Ori, B8 Ia). The periods they
determined broadly range from 1.22 to 74.74 days. Based on our differentially
rotating stellar structure and evolution model, Rigel, at it's current
evolutionary state, is undergoing core He burning and shell H burning. Linear
fully non-adiabatic non-radial stability analyses result in the excitation of a
dense spectrum of non-radial gravity-dominated mixed modes. The fundamental
radial mode (\ell=0) and its overtones are all stable. When the hydrogen
burning shell is located even partially in the radiative zone, a favorable
condition for destabilization of g-modes through the so-called
\epsilon-mechanism becomes viable. Only those g-modes that have high relative
amplitudes in the hydrogen burning (radiative) zone can survive the strong
radiative damping. From the entire observed range of variability periods of
Rigel (found in Paper I), and based on our model, only those modes with periods
ranging between 21 to 127 days can be theoretically explained by the
\epsilon-mechanism. The origin of the short-period variations (found in Paper
I) still remain unexplained. Because Rigel is similar to other massive BA
supergiants, we believe that the \epsilon-mechanism may be able to explain the
long-period variations in \alpha Cygni class of pulsating stars.

emission to obtain a total HI mass estimate. Opacity-corrected images of the
nearest external galaxies have been used to form a robust z=0 distribution
function of HI, f(N_HI,X,z=0), the probability of encountering a specific HI
column density per unit comoving distance. This is contrasted with previously
published determinations of f(N_HI,X) at z=1 and 3. A systematic decline of
moderate column density (18<log(N_HI)<21) HI is observed that corresponds to a
decline in surface area of such gas by a factor of five since z=3. The number
of equivalent DLA absorbers (log(N_HI)>20.3) has also declined systematically
over this redshift interval by a similar amount, while the cosmological mass
density in such systems has declined by only a factor of two to its current,
opacity corrected value of Omega_HI^DLA(z=0) = 5.4 +/- 0.9x10^-4.
  We utilize the tight, but strongly non-linear dependence of 21cm absorption
opacity on column density at z=0 to transform our HI images into ones of 21cm
absorption opacity. These images are used to calculate distribution and
pathlength functions of integrated 21cm opacity. The incidence of deep 21cm
absorption systems is predicted to show very little evolution with redshift,
while that of faint absorbers should decline by a factor of five between z=3

background sources that are extended relative to the 100pc intervening absorber
size scale. Future surveys of 21cm absorption will require very high angular

We have performed a detailed abundance analysis of 20 Herbig stars (three of

that half the stars in our sample show lambda Boo chemical peculiarities to
varying degrees, only one star shows weak Ap/Bp peculiarities, and all the

formation is a natural explanation for the remarkably large number of lambda
Boo stars in our sample. We also find that the magnetic Herbig stars do not
exhibit a range of chemical compositions remarkably different from the normal
stars: one magnetic star displays lambda Boo chemical peculiarities (HD

electrostatic fields could exist inside superconductors, and this assumption
was incorporated into conventional London electrodynamics. Yet the London
brothers themselves initially (in 1935) had proposed an electrodynamic theory
of superconductors that allowed for static electric fields in their interior,
which they unfortunately discarded a year later. I argue that the Meissner
effect in superconductors necessitates the existence of an electrostatic field
in their interior, originating in the expulsion of negative charge from the
interior to the surface when a metal becomes superconducting. The theory of
hole superconductivity predicts this physics, and associated with it a
macroscopic spin current in the ground state of superconductors (""Spin Meissner
effect""), qualitatively different from what is predicted by conventional
BCS-London theory. A new London-like electrodynamic description of
superconductors is proposed to describe this physics. Within this theory
superconductivity is driven by lowering of quantum kinetic energy, the fact
that the Coulomb repulsion strongly depends on the character of the charge
carriers, namely whether electron- or hole-like, and the spin-orbit
interaction. The electron-phonon interaction does not play a significant role,
yet the existence of an isotope effect in many superconductors is easily
understood. In the strong coupling regime the theory appears to favor local
charge inhomogeneity. The theory is proposed to apply to all superconducting
materials, from the elements to the high $T_c$ cuprates and pnictides, is
highly falsifiable, and explains a wide variety of experimental observations.

an efficient control parameter to induce the critical end point of the
first-order valence transition. Metamagnetism and non-Fermi liquid behavior
caused by this mechanism are discussed by comparing favorably with CeIrIn5,
YbAgCu4, and YbIr2Zn20. The interplay of the magnetic order and valence
fluctuations offers a key concept for understanding Ce- and Yb-based systems.
It is shown that suppression of the magnetic order by enhanced valence
fluctuations gives rise to the coincidence of the magnetic-transition point and
valence-crossover point at absolute zero as a function of pressure or magnetic
field. The interplay is shown to resolve the outstanding puzzle in CeRhIn5 in a

consequence of the reduced positional uncertainty and the detection of
modulated gamma-ray emission on the corresponding orbital periods. An analysis
of new data from the LAT, comprising 30 months of observations, identifies a
change in the gamma-ray behavior of LS I +61\degree 303. An increase in flux is
detected in March 2009 and a steady decline in the orbital flux modulation is
observed. Significant emission up to 30GeV is detected by the LAT; prior
datasets led to upper limits only. Contemporaneous TeV observations no longer
detected the source, or found it -in one orbit- close to periastron, far from
the phases at which the source previously appeared at TeV energies. The
detailed numerical simulations and models that exist within the literature do
not predict or explain many of these features now observed at GeV and TeV
energies. New ideas and models are needed to fully explain and understand this

exponential cutoff spectrum along each analyzed portion of the system's orbit.

to rapid inward migration. Recent work has shown that modeling the
thermodynamics without the assumption of local isothermality reveals regions
where the net torque on an embedded planet is positive, leading to outward
migration of the planet. When a region with negative torque lies directly
exterior to this, planets in the inner region migrate outwards and planets in
the outer region migrate inwards, converging where the torque is zero. We
incorporate the torques from an evolving non-isothermal disk into an N-body
simulation to examine the behavior of planets or planetary embryos interacting
in the convergence zone. We find that mutual interactions do not eject objects
from the convergence zone. Small numbers of objects in a laminar disk settle
into near resonant orbits that remain stable over the 10 Myr periods that we
examine. However, either or both increasing the number of planets or including
a correlated, stochastic force to represent turbulence drives orbit crossings
and mergers in the convergence zone. These processes can build gas giant cores
with masses of order ten Earth masses from sub-Earth mass embryos in 2-3 Myr.

with a variety of existing measurements. By using a microscopic quasi-classical
Eilenberger equation with the identified triplet pairing function under applied
fields, we performed detailed studies of the vortex structures for three
phases, including the vortex lattice symmetry, the local density of states, and
the internal field distribution. These quantities are directly measurable
experimentally by SANS, STM/STS, and NMR, respectively. It is found that, in
the B phase of low $H$ and low $T$, the double-core vortex is stabilized over a
singular vortex. In the C phase, thermal conductivity data are analyzed to
confirm the gap structure proposed. We also give detailed comparisons of
various proposed pair functions, concluding that the present scenario of
$E_{1u}$ with the $f$-wave, which is an analogue to the triplet planar state,
is better than the $E_{2u}$ or $E_{1g}$ scenario. Finally, we discuss the

Working Database that overlap SDSS imaging fields. We assign photometric
spectral types from M0 to M6 using (r-i) and (i-z) colors for every star in our
sample. Stripe 82 stars each have 50-100 epochs of data, while 2MASS
Calibration stars have ~1900 epochs. From these data we estimate the observed
rates and theoretical detection thresholds for flares in eight photometric
bands as a function of spectral type. Optical flare rates are found to be in
agreement with previous studies, while the frequency per hour of NIR flare
detections is found to be more than two orders of magnitude lower. An excess of
small amplitude flux increases in all bands exhibits a power-law distribution,
which we interpret as the result of flares below our detection thresholds. In
order to investigate the recovery efficiency for flares in each filter, we
extend a two-component flare model into the NIR. Quiescent M0-M6 spectral
templates were used with the model to predict the photometric response of
flares from u to Ks. We determine that red optical filters are sensitive to
flares with u-band amplitudes >2 mag, and NIR filters to flares with delta
u>4.5 mag. Our model predicts that M0 stars have the best color-contrast for
J-band detections, but M4-M6 stars should show the highest rate of NIR flares

photometric variations at longer wavelengths is important for predicting the

degree of freedom has grown up and now its investigation spans the scales from
quarks to nuclei. Measurements with identified strange hadrons can provide
important information on several hot topics in hadronic physics: the strange
distribution and fragmentation functions, the nucleon tomography and quark
orbital momentum, accessible through the study of the {\it generalized} parton
distribution and the {\it transverse momentum dependent} parton distribution
functions, the quark hadronization in the nuclear medium, the hadron
spectroscopy and the search for exotic mesons.
  The CLAS12 large acceptance spectrometer in Hall B at the Jefferson
Laboratory upgraded with a RICH detector together with the 12 GeV CEBAF high
intensity, high polarized electron beam can open new possibilities to study
strangeness in hard processes allowing breakthroughs in all those areas.
  This paper summarizes the physics case for a RICH detector for CLAS12. Many
topics have been intensively discussed at the International Workshop ""Probing
Strangeness in Hard Processes"" (PSHP2010) \cite{PSHP-workshop} held in
Frascati, Italy in October 2010. The authors of this papers like to thank all

coupling in rotating and rapidly quenched spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates. Our
results show that the fractionalized Skyrmion excitation depends on the
combination of spin-orbit coupling and rotation, and it originates from a
dipole structure of spin which is always embedded in three vortices constructed
by each condensate component respectively. When spin-orbit coupling is larger
than a critical value, the fractionalized Skyrmions encircle the center with
one or several circles to form a radial lattice, which occurs even in the
strong ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic condensates. We can use both the
spin-orbit coupling and the rotation to adjust the radial lattice. The
realization and the detection of the fractionalized Skyrmions are compatible
with current experimental technology.

Yang-Mills theories in the d-dimensional case. We find a qualitatively
different behavior for d=3,4 w.r.t. d=2. In particular, considering any
(sufficiently regular) gluon propagator D(p^2) and the one-loop-corrected ghost
propagator G(p^2), we prove in the 2d case that sigma(p^2) blows up in the
infrared limit p -> 0 as -D(0)\ln(p^2). Thus, for d=2, the no-pole condition
\sigma(p^2) < 1 (for p^2 > 0) can be satisfied only if D(0) = 0. On the
contrary, in d=3 and 4, sigma(p^2) is finite also if D(0) > 0. The same results
are obtained by evaluating G(p^2) explicitly at one loop, using fitting forms
for D(p^2) that describe well the numerical data of D(p^2) in d=2,3,4 in the
SU(2) case. These evaluations also show that, if one considers the coupling
constant g^2 as a free parameter, G(p^2) admits a one-parameter family of
behaviors (labelled by g^2), in agreement with Boucaud et al. In this case the
condition sigma(0) <= 1 implies g^2 <= g^2_c, where g^2_c is a 'critical'
value. Moreover, a free-like G(p^2) in the infrared limit is obtained for any
value of g^2 < g^2_c, while for g^2 = g^2_c one finds an infrared-enhanced
G(p^2). Finally, we analyze the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) for sigma(p^2)
and show that, for infrared-finite ghost-gluon vertices, one can bound
sigma(p^2). Using these bounds we find again that only in the d=2 case does one
need to impose D(0) = 0 in order to satisfy the no-pole condition. The d=2
result is also supported by an analysis of the DSE using a spectral
representation for G(p^2). Thus, if the no-pole condition is imposed, solving
the d=2 DSE cannot lead to a massive behavior for D(p^2). These results apply
to any Gribov copy inside the so-called first Gribov horizon, i.e. the 2d
result D(0) = 0 is not affected by Gribov noise. These findings are also in
agreement with lattice data.

realizing a variant of a fractionalized Fermi liquid. We speculate on how

conductivity and demonstrate a maximum in the resistance temperature dependence
Rxx(T) at the temperature {\approx} 46K which is usually associated with the
Curie temperature Tc of ferromagnetic (FM) transition in DL. However, it is
found that the Hall effect concentration of holes pH in QW does not decrease
below TC as one ordinary expects in similar systems. On the contrary, the
dependence pH(T) experiences a minimum at T = 80-100 K depending on the spacer

interpreted in the terms of magnetic proximity effect of DL on QW, leading to
induce spin polarization of the holes in QW. Strong structural and magnetic

ion transport in charged porous media under periodic fluid flow by an
asymptotic multi-scale expansion with drift. The microscopic setting is a
two-component periodic composite consisting of a dilute electrolyte continuum
(described by standard PNP equations) and a continuous dielectric matrix, which
is impermeable to the ions and carries a given surface charge. Four new
features arise in the upscaled equations: (i) the effective ionic diffusivities
and mobilities become tensors, related to the microstructure; (ii) the
effective permittivity is also a tensor, depending on the electrolyte/matrix
permittivity ratio and the ratio of the Debye screening length to the
macroscopic length of the porous medium; (iii) the microscopic fluidic
convection is replaced by a diffusion-dispersion correction in the effective
diffusion tensor; and (iv) the surface charge per volume appears as a
continuous ""background charge density"", as in classical membrane models. The
coefficient tensors in the upscaled PNP equations can be calculated from
periodic reference cell problems. For an insulating solid matrix, all gradients
are corrected by the same tensor, and the Einstein relation holds at the
macroscopic scale, which is not generally the case for a polarizable matrix,
unless the permittivity and electric field are suitably defined. In the limit
of thin double layers, Poisson's equation is replaced by macroscopic
electroneutrality (balancing ionic and surface charges). The general form of
the macroscopic PNP equations may also hold for concentrated solution theories,
based on the local-density and mean-field approximations. These results have
broad applicability to ion transport in porous electrodes, separators,
membranes, ion-exchange resins, soils, porous rocks, and biological tissues.

(S2), is combined with the primary scintillation in Log(S2/S1) vs. S1 only as a

  We show that one can accurately model \Halpha\ line formation assuming
statistical equilibrium and complete frequency redistribution provided the
computation of the model atmosphere included non-equilibrium ionization of
hydrogen, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ and Lyman-$\beta$ line profiles are described
by Doppler profiles.
  We find that 3D radiative transfer is essential in modeling hydrogen lines
due to the low photon destruction probability in \Halpha. The \Halpha\ opacity
in the upper chromosphere is mainly sensitive to the mass density and only
weakly sensitive to temperature.
  We find that the \Halpha\ line-core intensity is correlated with the average
formation height: the larger the average formation height, the lower the
intensity. The line-core width is a measure of the gas temperature in the
line-forming region. The fibril-like dark structures seen in \Halpha\ line-core
images computed from our model atmosphere are tracing magnetic field lines.
These structures are caused by field-aligned ridges of enhanced chromospheric
mass density that raise their average formation height, and therefore makes
them appear dark against their deeper-formed surroundings. We compare with
observations, and find that the simulated line-core widths are very similar to
the observed ones, without the need for additional microturbulence.

can be measured. We construct a toy model (""isolated lens model""; ILM) for the
distribution of galaxies and associated matter to determine the measured
quantities of the two G3L correlation functions and traditional galaxy-galaxy
lensing (GGL) in a simplified context. The ILM presumes single lens galaxies to
be embedded inside arbitrary matter haloes that, however, are statistically
independent (""isolated"") from any other halo or lens position. In the ILM, the
average mass-to-galaxy number ratio of clusters of any size cannot change. GGL
and galaxy clustering alone cannot distinguish an ILM from any more complex
scenario. The lens-lens-shear correlator in combination with second-order
statistics enables us to detect deviations from a ILM, though. This can be
quantified by a difference signal defined in the paper. We demonstrate with the
ILM that this correlator picks up the excess matter distribution about galaxy
pairs inside clusters. The lens-shear-shear correlator is sensitive to
variations among matter haloes. In principle, it could be devised to constrain
the ellipticities of haloes, without the need for luminous tracers, or maybe
even random halo substructure. [Abridged]

present a UQ framework within which the observations may be small or large in

the system in operation. The UQ objectives are posed as optimization problems,
the solutions of which are optimal bounds on the quantities of interest; we
consider two typical settings, namely parameter sensitivities (McDiarmid
diameters) and output deviation (or failure) probabilities. The solutions of
these optimization problems depend non-trivially (even non-monotonically and
discontinuously) upon the specified legacy data. Furthermore, the extreme
values are often determined by only a few members of the data set; in our
principal physically-motivated example, the bounds are determined by just 2 out
of 32 data points, and the remainder carry no information and could be
neglected without changing the final answer. We propose an analogue of the
simplex algorithm from linear programming that uses these observations to offer
efficient and rigorous UQ for high-dimensional systems with high-cardinality
legacy data. These findings suggest natural methods for selecting optimal

dynamics. From numerical simulations, its evolution since bar formation is
tightly linked to the dark halo in which the bar is formed through dynamical
friction and angular momentum exchange. Observational measurements of the bar
pattern speed with redshift can restrict models of galaxy formation and bar
evolution. We aim to determine, for the first time, the bar pattern speed
evolution with redshift based on morphological measurements. We have selected a
sample of 44 low inclination ringed galaxies from the SDSS and COSMOS surveys
covering the redshift range 0 <z< 0.8 to investigate the evolution of the bar
pattern speed. We have derived morphological ratios between the deprojected
outer ring radius (R_{ring}) and the bar size (R_{bar}). This quantity is
related to the parameter {\cal R}=R_{CR}/R_{bar} used for classifiying bars in
slow and fast rotators, and allow us to investigate possible differences with
redshift. We obtain a similar distribution of $R$ at all redshifts. We do not
find any systematic effect that could be forcing this result. The results
obtained here are compatible with both, the bulk of the bar population (~70%)
being fast-rotators and no evolution of the pattern speed with redshift. We
argue that if bars are long-lasting structures, the results presented here
imply that there has not been a substantial angular momentum exchange between
the bar and halo, as predicted by numerical simulations. In consequence, this
might imply that the discs of these high surface-brightness galaxies are
maximal.

E \textbf{78},
020301(R) (2008)] based on the thermal diffusion factor $\Lambda$ of an
intruder in a heated granular gas described by the inelastic Enskog equation is
revisited. The sign of $\Lambda$ provides a criterion for the transition
between the Brazil-nut effect (BNE) and the reverse Brazil-nut effect (RBNE).
The present theory incorporates two extra ingredients not accounted for by the
previous theoretical attempt. First, the theory is based upon the second Sonine
approximation to the transport coefficients of the mass flux of intruder.
Second, the dependence of the temperature ratio (intruder temperature over that
of the host granular gas) on the solid volume fraction is taken into account in
the first and second Sonine approximations. In order to check the accuracy of
the Sonine approximation considered, the Enskog equation is also numerically
solved by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method to get the
kinetic diffusion coefficient $D_0$. The comparison between theory and
simulation shows that the second Sonine approximation to $D_0$ yields an
improvement over the first Sonine approximation when the intruder is lighter
than the gas particles in the range of large inelasticity. With respect to the
form of the phase diagrams for the BNE/RBNE transition, the kinetic theory
results for the factor $\Lambda$ indicate that while the form of these diagrams
depends sensitively on the order of the Sonine approximation considered when
gravity is absent, no significant differences between both Sonine solutions
appear in the opposite limit (gravity dominates the thermal gradient). In the
former case (no gravity), the first Sonine approximation overestimates both the
RBNE region and the influence of dissipation on thermal diffusion segregation.

also find a so-called secondary symmetrization whose direct consequence is the
extension of the sufficient stability condition obtained earlier for
non-relativistic planar current-vortex sheets to the relativistic case. As in
non-relativistic settings, this implies the local-in-time existence of
corresponding smooth nonplanar current-vortex sheets.

countries we make three assumptions which are detailed below. First, we use
logistic regressions to fit and extrapolate the HDI on a country level as a
function of time. This is mainly motivated by the fact that the HDI is bounded
between 0 and 1 and that it decelerates as it approaches 1. Second, we employ
for individual countries the correlations between CO2 per capita emissions and
HDI in order to extrapolate their emissions. This is an ergodic assumption.
Third, we let countries with incomplete data records evolve similarly as their
close neighbors (in the emissions-HDI plane, see Fig. 1 in the main text) with
complete time series of CO2 per capita emissions and HDI. Country-based
emissions estimates are obtained by multiplying extrapolated CO2 per capita
values by population numbers of three scenarios extracted from the Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment report. Finally, we propose a reduction scheme, where
countries with an HDI above the development threshold reduce their per capita
CO2 emissions with a rate that is proportional to their HDI. We estimate the
minimum proportionality constant so that the global emissions by 2050 meet the

consisting of radio sources with peak flux density $>$ 60 $\mu$Jy with deep
near-infrared data limited to $K_{\mathrm{s}}\lesssim$ 22.6. Comparing the
infrared counterparts from this procedure to those obtained when cross-matching
a set of simulated lower resolution radio catalogues indicates that degrading
the resolution from 6 arcsec to 10 and 15 arcsec decreases the completeness of
the cross-matched catalogue by approximately 3 and 7 percent respectively. When
matching against shallower infrared data, comparable to that achieved by the
VISTA Hemisphere Survey, the fraction of radio sources with reliably identified
counterparts drops from $\sim$89%, at $K_{\mathrm{s}}\lesssim$22.6, to 47% with
$K_{\mathrm{s}}\lesssim$20.0. Decreasing the resolution at this shallower
infrared limit does not result in any further decrease in the completeness
produced by the likelihood ratio matching procedure. However, we note that
radio continuum surveys with the MeerKAT and eventually the SKA, will require
long baselines in order to ensure that the resulting maps are not limited by

optimal up to endpoints. These estimates are often used in the theory of
nonlinear Dirac equations on R^{1+1}. The proof of the bilinear estimates
follows from a dyadic decomposition in the spirit of Tao [21] and D'Ancona,
Foschi, and Selberg [11]. As an application, by using the I-method of
Colliander, Keel, Staffilani, Takaoka, and Tao, we extend the work of Tesfahun
[23] on global existence below the charge class for the Dirac-Klein- Gordon
equation on R^{1+1}.

presence of body forces such that the Coriolis or the buoyancy forces, which
may render a wide range of turbulence scales anisotropic. The corresponding
statistical characterization of such effects is done in physical space using
structure functions, as well as in spectral space with spectra of two-point
correlations, providing two complementary viewpoints. In this framework,
second-order and third-order structure functions are put in parallel with
spectra of two-point second- and third-order velocity correlation functions,
using passage relations. Such relations apply in the isotropic case, or for
isotropically averaged statistics, which, however, do not reflect the actual
more complex structure of anisotropic turbulence submitted to rotation or
stratification. This complexity is demonstrated in this paper by
orientation-dependent energy and energy transfer spectra produced in both cases
by means of a two-point statistical model for axisymmetric turbulence. We show
that, to date, the anisotropic formalism used in the spectral transfer
statistics is especially well-suited to analyze the refined dynamics of
anisotropic homogeneous turbulence, and that it can help in the analysis of
isotropically computed third-order structure function statistics often used to
characterize anisotropic contexts.

generalising Alur et al.'s concept of nested pushdown trees. Nested pushdown
trees are useful representations of control flows in the verification of
programs with recursive calls of first-order functions. Higher-order nested
pushdown trees are expansions of unfoldings of graphs generated by higher-order
pushdown systems. Moreover, the class of nested pushdown trees of level n is
uniformly first-order interpretable in the class of collapsible pushdown graphs
of level n+1. The relationship between the class of higher-order pushdown
graphs and the class of collapsible higher-order pushdown graphs is not very
well understood. We hope that the further study of the nested pushdown tree
hierarchy leads to a better understanding of these two hierarchies. In this
paper, we are concerned with the first-order model checking problem on
higher-order nested pushdown trees. We show that the first-order model checking
on the first two levels of this hierarchy is decidable. Moreover, we obtain an
2-EXPSPACE algorithm for the class of nested pushdown trees of level 1. The
proof technique involves a pseudo-local analysis of strategies in the
Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse games on two identical copies of a nested pushdown tree.
Ordinary locality arguments in the spirit of Gaifman's lemma do not apply here
because nested pushdown trees tend to have small diameters. We introduce the
notion of relevant ancestors which provide a sufficient description of the FO_k
-type of each element in a higher-order nested pushdown tree. The local
analysis of these ancestors allows us to prove the existence of restricted
winning strategies in the Ehrenfeucht-Fraisse game. These strategies are then
used to create a first-order model checking algorithm.

The interaction is found to be dominated by electronic transitions, and hence
independent of the internal temperature of the molecules. The contributions
from phonon transitions, which are affected by the molecular temperature, give
rise to only a small correction. Moreover, we find that the sizeable molecular
line widths of thermal fullerenes may modify the nonretarded interaction,

ACM",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Symmetry breaking problems are among the most well studied in the field of
distributed computing and yet the most fundamental questions about their
complexity remain open. In this paper we work in the LOCAL model (where the
input graph and underlying distributed network are identical) and study the
randomized complexity of four fundamental symmetry breaking problems on graphs:
computing MISs (maximal independent sets), maximal matchings, vertex colorings,
and ruling sets. A small sample of our results includes
  - An MIS algorithm running in $O(\log^2\Delta + 2^{O(\sqrt{\log\log n})})$
time, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree. This is the first MIS algorithm to
improve on the 1986 algorithms of Luby and Alon, Babai, and Itai, when $\log n
\ll \Delta \ll 2^{\sqrt{\log n}}$, and comes close to the $\Omega(\log \Delta)$
lower bound of Kuhn, Moscibroda, and Wattenhofer.
  - A maximal matching algorithm running in $O(\log\Delta + \log^4\log n)$
time. This is the first significant improvement to the 1986 algorithm of
Israeli and Itai. Moreover, its dependence on $\Delta$ is provably optimal.
  - A method for reducing symmetry breaking problems in low
arboricity/degeneracy graphs to low degree graphs. (Roughly speaking, the
arboricity or degeneracy of a graph bounds the density of any subgraph.)
Corollaries of this reduction include an $O(\sqrt{\log n})$-time maximal
matching algorithm for graphs with arboricity up to $2^{\sqrt{\log n}}$ and an
$O(\log^{2/3} n)$-time MIS algorithm for graphs with arboricity up to $2^{(\log
n)^{1/3}}$.
  Each of our algorithms is based on a simple, but powerful technique for
reducing a randomized symmetry breaking task to a corresponding deterministic
one on a poly$(\log n)$-size graph.

laser excitation, our experiments reveal the apparition of the so-called inner
photoluminescence ring. It is characterized by a ring shaped photoluminescence
which suddenly collapses once the laser excitation is terminated. We show that
the spectrally resolved dynamics is in agreement with an excitonic origin for
the inner-ring which is formed due to a local heating of indirect excitons by
the laser excitation. To confirm this interpretation and exclude the ionization
of indirect excitons, we evaluate the excitonic density that is extracted from
the energy of the photoluminescence emission. It is shown that optically
injected carriers play a crucial role in that context as these are trapped in
our field-effect device and then vary the electrostatic potential controlling
the confinement of indirect excitons. This disruptive effect blurs the
estimation of the exciton concentration. However, it suppressed by smoothing
the electrostatic environment of the double quantum well by placing the latter
behind a super-lattice. In this improved geometry, we then estimate that the
exciton density remains one order of magnitude smaller than the critical
density for the ionization of indirect excitons (or Mott transition) in the
regime where the inner-ring is formed.

the ones of GR, scalars develop an exponential Jeans-like instability on

kinetic part. This equilibrium is defined such that its incoming velocity
moments coincide with the incoming velocity moments of the distribution
function. A consequence of this strategy is that no artificial boundary
condition is needed in the micro-macro models and the exact boundary condition
on $f$ is naturally transposed to the macro part of the model. This method
provides an 'Asymptotic preserving' numerical scheme which generates a very
good approximation of the space boundary values at the diffusive limit, without
any mesh refinement in the boundary layers. Our numerical results are in very

fitting scattering data and properties of bound states. The many-body character
of the problem is approximatively accounted for by Pauli forbidden states. An
important feature of the approach is the consideration of the dependence of the
interaction potential between the clusters on the orbital Young schemes, which
determine the permutation symmetry of the nucleon system. Proton capture on 2H,
6Li, 7Li, 12C, and 13C was analyzed in this approach. Experimental data at low
energies were described reasonably well when the phase shifts for
cluster-cluster scattering, extracted from precise data, were used. This shows
that decreasing the experimental error on differential elastic scattering cross
sections of light nuclei at astrophysical energies is very important also to
allow a more accurate phase shift analysis. A future increase in precision will
allow more definite conclusions regarding the reaction mechanisms and
astrophysical conditions of thermonuclear reactions.

Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF), namely, cannot be used as such. SMT is a
generalization of ZF: whereas ZF uses only sets as primitive objects, in the
framework of SMT finite matrices with set-valued entries are objects sui
generis, with a one-by-one set matrix [x] being identical to the set x. It is
proved that every set that can be constructed in ZF can also be constructed in
SMT: as a mathematical foundation, SMT is thus not weaker than ZF. In addition,
it is shown that SMT is more suitable han ZF for the intended application to
physics. The conclusion is that SMT, contrary to ZF, is acceptable as the
mathematical-logical foundation of the framework for physics that is determined
by the EPT.

mean large-frequency separation ($\Delta\nu$) of CHeB stars when metallicity $Z
\geq$ 0.02. The $\nu_{max}$ and $\Delta\nu$ of CHeB stars are dependent not
only on He core mass but on H-shell burning. The SRC peak is composed of the
CHeB stars with mass roughly between the critical mass M_{Hef} and M_{Hef}+0.2
while He core mass is between about 0.33 and 0.36 M_{sun}. The location of the
SRC peak can be affected by the mixing-length parameter $\alpha$, metallicity
$Z$, and overshooting parameter $\delta_{ov}$. A decrease in $\alpha$ or
increase in $Z$ or $\delta_{ov}$ leads to a movement of the SRC peak towards a
lower frequency. However, the change in $Z$ and $\alpha$ only slightly affects
the value of M_{Hef} but the variation in $\delta_{ov}$ can significantly
affects the value of M_{Hef}. Thus the SRC peak might aid in determining the
value of M_{Hef} and calibrating $\delta_{ov}$. In addition, the effects of
convective acceleration of SRC stars and the $\nu_{max}$ of `semi-degenerate'
stars decreasing with mass result in the appearance of a shoulder between about
40 and 50 $\mu$hz in the \dnu{} distribution. However, the convective
acceleration of stars with M < M_{Hef} leads to the deficit in the $\nu_{max}$
distribution between about 9 and 20 $\mu$hz{}. Moreover, the value of the
parameter $b$ of the relation between $\nu_{max}$ and $\Delta\nu$ for the

transmission of data in the network. The existing schemes consider homogeneous
sensor networks which have poor performance and scalability. Due to many-to-one
traffic pattern, sensors may communicate with small portion of its neighbours.
Key management is the critical process in sensor nodes to secure the data. Most
existing schemes establish shared keys for all the sensors no matter whether
they are communicating or not. Hence it leads to large storage overhead.
Another problem in sensor network is compromised node attack and denial of
service attack which occurs because of its wireless nature. Existing multi path
routing algorithms are vulnerable to these attacks. So once an adversary
acquires the routing algorithm, it can compute the same routes known to the
source, and hence endanger all information sent over these routes. If an
adversary performs node compromise attack, they can easily get the encryption/
decryption keys used by that node and hence they can intercept the information
easily. In this paper we are proposing a key management scheme which only
establishes shared keys with their communicating neighbour and a mechanism to
generate randomized multipath routes for secure transmission of data to the
sink. Here we are adopting heterogeneous sensor networks and we are utilizing
elliptic curve cryptography for efficient key management which is more
efficient, scalable, and highly secure and reduces communication overhead. The
routes generated by our mechanism are highly dispersive, energy efficient and
making them quite capable of bypassing the back holes at low energy cost.

state, local data queue state and local energy queue state only. In turn, we
consider two delay optimization formulations, namely the decentralized
partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) and Non-cooperative
partially observable stochastic game (POSG). In DEC-POMDP formulation, we
derive a decentralized online learning algorithm to determine the control
actions and Lagrangian multipliers (LMs) simultaneously, based on the policy
gradient approach. Under some mild technical conditions, the proposed
decentralized policy gradient algorithm converges almost surely to a local
optimal solution. On the other hand, in the non-cooperative POSG formulation,
the transmitter nodes are non-cooperative. We extend the decentralized policy
gradient solution and establish the technical proof for almost-sure convergence
of the learning algorithms. In both cases, the solutions are very robust to
model variations. Finally, the delay performance of the proposed solutions are
compared with conventional baseline schemes for interference networks and it is
illustrated that substantial delay performance gain and energy savings can be
achieved.

to the classroom, the Hands on Universe (HOU) developed a set of exercises and
platform using real data obtained by some of the most advanced ground and space
observatories. The backbone of this endeavour is a new free software Web tool -
Such a Lovely Software for Astronomy based on Image J (Salsa J). It is
student-friendly and developed specifically for the HOU project and targets
middle and high schools. It allows students to display, analyze, and explore
professionally obtained astronomical images, while learning concepts on
gravitational dynamics, kinematics, nuclear fusion, electromagnetism. The
continuous evolving set of exercises and tutorials is being completed with real
(professionally obtained) data to download and detailed tutorials. The
flexibility of the Salsa J platform tool enables students and teachers to
extend the exercises with their own observations. The software developed for
the HOU program has been designed to be a multi-platform, multi-lingual
experience for image manipulation and analysis in the classroom. Its design
enables easy implementation of new facilities (extensions and plugins), minimal
in-situ maintenance and flexibility for exercise plugin. Here, we describe some
of the most advanced exercises about astrophysics in the classroom, addressing
particular examples on gravitational dynamics, concepts currently introduced in
most sciences curricula in middle and high schools.

Eldar and Zvi Friedman","Compressed Beamforming in Ultrasound Imaging","14 pages, 11 figures",,"10.1109/TSP.2012.2200891",,"cs.IT cs.CV math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Emerging sonography techniques often require increasing the number of
transducer elements involved in the imaging process. Consequently, larger
amounts of data must be acquired and processed. The significant growth in the
amounts of data affects both machinery size and power consumption. Within the
classical sampling framework, state of the art systems reduce processing rates
by exploiting the bandpass bandwidth of the detected signals. It has been
recently shown, that a much more significant sample-rate reduction may be
obtained, by treating ultrasound signals within the Finite Rate of Innovation
framework. These ideas follow the spirit of Xampling, which combines classic
methods from sampling theory with recent developments in Compressed Sensing.
Applying such low-rate sampling schemes to individual transducer elements,
which detect energy reflected from biological tissues, is limited by the noisy
nature of the signals. This often results in erroneous parameter extraction,
bringing forward the need to enhance the SNR of the low-rate samples. In our
work, we achieve SNR enhancement, by beamforming the sub-Nyquist samples
obtained from multiple elements. We refer to this process as ""compressed
beamforming"". Applying it to cardiac ultrasound data, we successfully image
macroscopic perturbations, while achieving a nearly eight-fold reduction in
sample-rate, compared to standard techniques.

Technology (ICT) is the emergence of E-Learning. Considering the importance and
need of E-Learning, recent years have seen a drastic change of learning
methodologies in Higher Education. Undoubtedly, the three main entities of
E-Learning system can be considered as Student, Teacher & Controlling Authority
and there will be different level, but a good E-Learning system needs total
integrity among all entities in every level. Apart from integrity enforcement,
security enforcement in the whole system is the other crucial way to organize
the it. As internet is the backbone of the entire system which is inherently
insecure, during transaction of message in E-Learning system, hackers attack by
utilising different loopholes of technology. So different security measures are
required to be imposed on the system. In this paper, emphasis is given on
different risks called e-risks and their remedies called e-remedies to build
trust in the minds of all participants of E-Learning system.

network topologies using tools from algebraic graph theory. Each agent in the
network acts in a decentralized fashion by updating its state in accordance
with a nearest-neighbor averaging rule, known as the consensus dynamics. In
order to control the system, external control inputs are injected into the so
called leader nodes, and the influence is propagated throughout the network.
Our main result is a tight topological lower bound on the rank of the
controllability matrix for such systems with arbitrary network topologies and
possibly multiple leaders.
