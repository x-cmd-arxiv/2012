rare event and the mean time for such passage increases indefinitely as the
bottleneck's radius shrinks to zero. Its calculation reveals the effect of
geometry and smoothness on the flux through the bottleneck. We find new
behavior of the narrow escape time through bottlenecks in planar and spatial
domains and on a surface. Some applications are discussed.

photonic quantum fields in a one-dimensional waveguide. Specifically, we
consider a three-level or four-level system for the atom. Photon-photon bound
states emerge as a manifestation of the strong photon-photon correlation
mediated by the atom. Effective repulsive or attractive interaction between
photons can be produced, causing either suppressed multiphoton transmission
(photon blockade) or enhanced multiphoton transmission (photon-induced
tunneling). As a result, nonclassical light sources can be generated on demand
by sending coherent states into the proposed system. We calculate the
second-order correlation function of the transmitted field and observe bunching
and antibunching caused by the bound states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
the proposed system can produce photon pairs with a high degree of spectral
entanglement, which have a large capacity for carrying information and are
important for large-alphabet quantum communication.

consider large deviations from the Manakov limit illustrating that this

Carlo technique is used to efficiently determine this steady state. The hybrid
model predicts features in the pair correlation function arising from

a C*-algebra A. This action satisfies an ""almost inner"" property which ensures
affiliation of the generators of the derivations {\delta} with A, and is
expressed in terms of corresponding pseudo-resolvents. In particular, for an
abelian Lie algebra X acting on a primitive C*-algebra A, it is shown that
there is a central extension of X which determines algebraic relations of the
underlying pseudo- resolvents. If the Lie action {\delta} is ergodic, i.e. the
only elements of A on which all the derivations in {\delta}_x vanish are
multiples of the identity, then this extension is given by a (non-degenerate)
symplectic form {\sigma} on X. Moreover, the algebra generated by the
pseudo-resolvents coincides with the resolvent algebra based on the symplectic
space (X, {\sigma}). Thus the resolvent algebra of the canonical commutation
relations, which was recently introduced in physically motivated analyses of
quantum systems, appears also naturally in the representation theory of Lie
algebras of derivations acting on C*-algebras.

in coincident operation, with a total observation time of 207 days. The
analysis searches for transients of duration < 1 s over the frequency band
64-5000 Hz, without other assumptions on the signal waveform, polarization,
direction or occurrence time. All identified events are consistent with the
expected accidental background. We set frequentist upper limits on the rate of
gravitational-wave bursts by combining this search with the previous LIGO-Virgo
search on the data collected between November 2005 and October 2007. The upper
limit on the rate of strong gravitational-wave bursts at the Earth is 1.3
events per year at 90% confidence. We also present upper limits on source rate
density per year and Mpc^3 for sample populations of standard-candle sources.
As in the previous joint run, typical sensitivities of the search in terms of
the root-sum-squared strain amplitude for these waveforms lie in the range 5
10^-22 Hz^-1/2 to 1 10^-20 Hz^-1/2. The combination of the two joint runs
entails the most sensitive all-sky search for generic gravitational-wave bursts

interferometric detectors.

there exists an inherent clash between truthfulness and computational
tractability: in particular, whether polynomial-time truthful mechanisms for
combinatorial auctions are provably weaker in terms of approximation ratio than
non-truthful ones. This question was very recently answered for universally
truthful mechanisms for combinatorial auctions \cite{D11}, and even for
truthful-in-expectation mechanisms \cite{DughmiV11}. However, both of these
results are based on information-theoretic arguments for valuations given by a
value oracle, and leave open the possibility of polynomial-time truthful
mechanisms for succinctly described classes of valuations.
  This paper is the first to prove {\em computational hardness} results for
truthful mechanisms for combinatorial auctions with succinctly described
valuations. We prove that there is a class of succinctly represented submodular
valuations for which no deterministic truthful mechanism provides an
$m^{1/2-\epsilon}$-approximation for a constant $\epsilon>0$, unless $NP=RP$
($m$ denotes the number of items). Furthermore, we prove that even
truthful-in-expectation mechanisms cannot approximate combinatorial auctions
with certain succinctly described submodular valuations better than within
$n^\gamma$, where $n$ is the number of bidders and $\gamma>0$ some absolute
constant, unless $NP \subseteq P/poly$. In addition, we prove computational
hardness results for two related problems.

Abraham claimed that Einstein borrowed his equations; however, it was actually
Abraham who needed Einstein's ideas and not the other way round. Einstein
thought that Abraham converted to his theory of static fields while Abraham
presumed exactly the opposite. Einstein then moved to Zurich and switched to
new mathematical tools. He examined various candidates for generally covariant
field equations, and already considered the field equations of his general
theory of relativity about three years before he published them in November
1915. However, he discarded these equations only to return to them more than
three years later. Einstein's 1912 theory of static fields finally led him to
reject the generally covariant field equations and to develop limited generally
covariant field equations.

construct a monotone submodular function $f$ with a high value $f(S)$ for every
set $S \in {\cF}$ (a ""peak""), and a low value on every set that does not
intersect significantly any set in $\cF$.
  We use this construction to show that a better than
$(1-\frac{1}{2e})$-approximation ($\simeq 0.816$) for welfare maximization in
combinatorial auctions with submodular valuations is (1) impossible in the
communication model, (2) NP-hard in the computational model where valuations
are given explicitly. Establishing a constant approximation hardness for this
problem in the communication model was a long-standing open question. The
valuations we construct for the hardness result in the computational model
depend only on a constant number of items, and hence the result holds even if
the players can answer arbitrary queries about their valuation, including
demand queries.
  We also study two other related problems that received some attention
recently: max-min allocation (for which we also get hardness of $(1-\frac 1

can explain most of the 1 - 40 keV spectral variation by change of the partial
covering fraction, similar to the one proposed by Miller et al. (2008). Our
spectral model is composed of three continuum components; (1) a direct
power-law component, (2) a heavily absorbed power-law component by mildly
ionized intervening matter, and (3) a cold disk reflection component far from
the black hole with moderate solid-angle ({\Omega}/2{\pi} \approx 0.3)
accompanying a narrow fluorescent iron line. The first two components are
affected by the surrounding highly ionized thin absorber with N_H \approx
10^{23.4}cm-2 and log {\xi} \approx 3.4. The heavy absorber in the second
component is fragmented into many clouds, each of which is composed of radial
zones with different ionization states and column densities, the main body (N_H
\approx 10^24.2cm-2, log {\xi} \approx 1.6), the envelope (N_H \approx
10^22.1cm-2, log {\xi} \approx 1.9) and presumably a completely opaque core.
These parameters of the ionized absorbers, as well as the intrinsic spectral
shape of the X-ray source, are unchanged at all. The central X-ray source is
moderately extended, and its luminosity is not significantly variable. The
observed flux and spectral variations are mostly explained by variation of the
geometrical partial covering fraction of the central source from 0 (uncovered)
to \sim0.63 by the intervening ionized clouds in the line of sight. The ionized
iron K-edge of the heavily absorbed component explains most of the seemingly
broad line-like feature, a well-known spectral characteristic of MCG-6-30-15.
The direct component and the absorbed component anti-correlate, cancelling
their variations each other, so that the fractional spectral variation becomes
the minimum at the iron energy band; another observational characteristic of
MCG-6-30-15 is thus explained.

the aid of the evolution equation for entanglement given by Konrad et al. [Nat.

entanglement, we classify the ansatz states in our investigation by the amount
of robustness, and consequently derive the most fragile states. For the
two-sided channel, the pure states are the most robust for a fixed concurrence.
Under the uniform channel, the most fragile states have the minimal negativity
when the concurrence is given in the region [1/2,1]. For a given negativity,
the most robust states are the ones with the maximal concurrence, and the most
fragile ones are the pure states with minimum of concurrence. When the
entanglement approaches zero, the most fragile states under general nonuniform
channels tend to the ones in the uniform channel. Influences on robustness by
entanglement, degree of mixture, and asymmetry between the two qubits are
discussed through numerical calculations. It turns out that the concurrence and
negativity are major factors for the robustness. When they are fixed, the
impact of the mixedness becomes obvious. In the nonuniform channels, the most
fragile states are closely correlated with the asymmetry, while the most robust
ones with the degree of mixture.

HARPS and Kepler surveys. We compare the statistical properties of planets in
systems with m.sin i >5-10 M_Earth and R>2 R_Earth. If we assume that the
underlying population has the same characteristics, the different detection
sensitivity to the orbital inclination relative to the line of sight allows us
to probe the planets' mutual inclination.
  Methods. We considered the frequency of systems with one, two and three
planets as dictated by HARPS data. We used Kepler's planetary period and host
mass and radii distributions (corrected from detection bias) to model planetary
systems in a simple yet physically plausible way. We then varied the mutual
inclination between planets in a system according to different prescriptions
(completely aligned, Rayleigh distributions and isotropic) and compared the
transit frequencies with one, two or three planets with those measured by
Kepler.
  Results. The results show that the two datasets are compatible, a remarkable
result especially because there are no tunable knobs other than the assumed
inclination distribution. For m.sin i cutoffs of 7-10 M_Earth, which are those
expected to correspond to the radius cutoff of 2 R_Earth, we conclude that the
results are better described by a Rayleigh distribution with mode of 1 deg or
smaller. We show that the best-fit scenario only becomes a Rayleigh
distribution with mode of 5 deg if we assume a rather extreme mass-radius
relationship for the planetary population.
  Conclusions. These results have important consequences for our understanding
of the role of several proposed formation and evolution mechanisms. They
confirm that planets are likely to have been formed in a disk and show that
most planetary systems evolve quietly without strong angular momentum exchanges

between the source and selected relay for retransmitting of the source data
toward the destination if needed, using space-time codes or beamforming
techniques. We analyze the performance of the system. We first derive the
cumulative density function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the
selected relay HARQ channels. Then, the CDF and PDF are used to determine the
outage probability in the $l$-th round of HARQ. The outage probability is
required to compute the throughput-delay performance of this half-duplex
opportunistic relaying protocol. The packet delay constraint is represented by
$L$, the maximum number of HARQ rounds. An outage is declared if the packet is
unsuccessful after $L$ HARQ rounds. Furthermore, closed-form upper-bounds on
outage probability are derived and subsequently are used to investigate the
diversity order of the system. Based on the derived upper-bound expressions, it
is shown that the proposed schemes achieve the full spatial diversity order of

is in polytypical superlattices, the proposed model was applied to a single
quantum well of InP to extract the physics of the wurtzite/zincblend
polytypism. By the analysis of our results, some trends can be predicted:
spatial carriers' separation, predominance of perpendicular polarization (xy
plane) in the luminescence spectra and interband transition blueshifts with
strain. A possible range of values for the WZ InP spontaneous polarization was
suggested.

Method of Multipliers (D-ADMM), for solving separable optimization problems in
networks of interconnected nodes or agents. In a separable optimization problem
there is a private cost function and a private constraint set at each node. The
goal is to minimize the sum of all the cost functions, constraining the
solution to be in the intersection of all the constraint sets. D-ADMM is proven
to converge when the network is bipartite or when all the functions are
strongly convex, although in practice, convergence is observed even when these
conditions are not met. We use D-ADMM to solve the following problems from
signal processing and control: average consensus, compressed sensing, and
support vector machines. Our simulations show that D-ADMM requires less
communications than state-of-the-art algorithms to achieve a given accuracy
level. Algorithms with low communication requirements are important, for
example, in sensor networks, where sensors are typically battery-operated and
communicating is the most energy consuming operation.

radius R for a set of 'mono-abundance' sub-populations of stars with very
similar elemental abundances [\alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H]. We find that all

decrease of the vertical velocity dispersion: \sigma_z (z,R|[\alpha/Fe],[Fe/H])
~ \sigma_z ([\alpha/Fe],[Fe/H]) x \exp (-(R-R_0)/7 kpc}). The characteristic
velocity dispersions of these components vary from ~ 15 km/s for chemically
young, metal-rich stars, to >~ 50 km/s for metal poor stars. The mean \sigma_z
gradient away from the mid plane is only 0.3 +/- 0.2 km/s/kpc. We find a
continuum of vertical kinetic temperatures (~\sigma^2_z) as function of
([\alpha/Fe],[Fe/H]), which contribute to the stellar surface mass density as
\Sigma_{R_0}(\sigma^2_z) ~ \exp(-\sigma^2_z). The existence of isothermal
mono-abundance populations with intermediate dispersions reject the notion of a
thin-thick disk dichotomy. This continuum of disks argues against models where
the thicker disk portions arise from massive satellite infall or heating;
scenarios where either the oldest disk portion was born hot, or where internal
evolution plays a major role, seem the most viable. The wide range of \sigma_z
([\alpha/Fe],[Fe/H]) combined with a constant \sigma_z(z) for each abundance
bin provides an independent check on the precision of the SEGUE abundances:
\delta_[\alpha/Fe] ~ 0.07 dex and \delta_[Fe/H] ~ 0.15 dex. The radial decline
of the vertical dispersion presumably reflects the decrease in disk
surface-mass density. This measurement constitutes a first step toward a purely
dynamical estimate of the mass profile the disk in our Galaxy. [abridged]

color-magnitude diagram position: the stars with higher metallicity and
relative s-process abundances define a fainter SGB, while stars with lower
metallicity and s-process content reside on a relatively brighter SGB. This
result has implications for the relative ages of the two stellar groups of M22.
In particular, it is inconsistent with a large spread in ages of the two SGBs.
By accounting for the chemical content of the two stellar groups, isochrone

LLRs at high SNRs. We employ an LLR-domain SPA decoder that does not saturate
near-certain messages and find the error rates of our decoder to be lower by at
least several orders of magnitude. We study the behavior of trapping sets (or
near-codewords) that are the dominant cause of the reported error floors.
  We develop a refined linear model, based on the work of Sun and others, that

superconductivity in iron-pnictide superconductors, a central question has been
whether magnetism in these materials arises from weakly correlated electrons,
as in the case of spin-density-wave in pure chromium, requires strong electron
correlations, or can even be described in terms of localized electrons such as
the AF insulating state of copper oxides. Here we use inelastic neutron
scattering to determine the absolute intensity of the magnetic excitations
throughout the Brillouin zone in electron-doped superconducting
BaFe$_{1.9}$Ni$_{0.1}$As$_{2}$ ($T_c=20$ K), which allows us to obtain the size
of the fluctuating magnetic moment $<m^2>$, and its energy distribution. We
find that superconducting BaFe$_{1.9}$Ni$_{0.1}$As$_{2}$ and AF BaFe$_2$As$_2$
both have fluctuating magnetic moments $<m^2>\approx3.2\ \mu_B^2$ per Fe(Ni),
which are similar to those found in the AF insulating copper oxides. The common
theme in both classes of high temperature superconductors is that magnetic
excitations have partly localized character, thus showing the importance of
strong correlations for high temperature superconductivity.

enough budget. Our job is to price the items to maximize the revenue. This
problem can also be defined on higher dimensions. We call this problem the
geometric pricing problem.
  In this paper, we study a new class of problems arising from a geometric
aspect of the pricing problem. It intuitively captures typical real-world
assumptions that have been widely studied in marketing research, healthcare
economics, etc. It also helps classify other well-known pricing problems, such
as the highway pricing problem and the graph vertex pricing problem on planar
and bipartite graphs. Moreover, this problem turns out to have close
connections to other natural geometric problems such as the geometric versions
of the unique coverage and maximum feasible subsystem problems.
  We show that the low dimensionality arising in this pricing problem does lead
to improved approximation ratios, by presenting sublinear-approximation
algorithms for two central versions of the problem: unit-demand uniform-budget
min-buying and single-minded pricing problems. Our algorithm is obtained by
combining algorithmic pricing and geometric techniques. These results suggest
that considering geometric aspect might be a promising research direction in
obtaining improved approximation algorithms for such pricing problems. To the
best of our knowledge, this is one of very few problems in the intersection
between geometry and algorithmic pricing areas. Thus its study may lead to new
algorithmic techniques that could benefit both areas.

radiative corrections, a la Coleman-Weinberg. When a certain correlation among
the superpotential parameters is present, a local supersymmetry-breaking
minimum is found in the effective potential of a gauge non-singlet field, in a
region where the tree-level potential is almost flat. Supersymmetry breaking is
then transmitted to the MSSM through gauge and chiral messenger loops, thus
avoiding the suppression of gaugino masses characteristic of direct gauge
mediation models. The use of a single field ensures that no dangerous tachyonic
scalar masses are generated at the one-loop level. We illustrate this mechanism
with an explicit example based on an SU(5) model with a single adjoint. An
interesting feature of the scenario is that the GUT scale is increased with
respect to standard unification, thus allowing for a larger colour Higgs

the magnetic anisotropic stress, which depends quadratically on non-helical and

new rate coefficients for the collisional excitation of CO (Yang et al. 2010),
the excitation of warm astrophysical CO is revisited with the use of numerical
and analytic methods. For the case of an isothermal medium, results have been
obtained for a wide range of gas temperatures (100 to 5000 K) and H2 densities
(1E+3 to 1E+9 cm-3), and presented in the form of rotational diagrams, in which
the logarithm of the column density per magnetic substate, log (N[J]/g[J]), is
plotted for each state, as a function of its energy, E[J]. For rotational
transitions in the wavelength range accessible to Herschel/PACS, such diagrams
are nearly linear when n(H2) > 1E+8 cm-3. When log10(n[H2]) = 6.8 to 8, they
exhibit significant negative curvature, whereas when log10(n[H2]) < 4.8 the
curvature is uniformly positive throughout the PACS-accessible range. Thus, the
observation of a positively-curved CO rotational diagram does not NECESSARILY
require the presence of multiple temperature components. Indeed, for some
sources observed with Herschel/PACS, the CO rotational diagrams show a modest
positive curvature that can be explained by a single isothermal component.
Typically, the required physical parameters are H2 densities in the 1E+4 to
1E+5 cm-3 range and temperatures, T, close to the maximum at which CO can
survive. Other sources exhibit rotational diagrams with more curvature than can
be accounted for by a single temperature component. For the case of a medium
with a power-law distribution of gas temperatures, with dN/dT proportional to T
to the power -b, results have been obtained for H2 densities 1E+3 to 1E+9 cm-3
and power-law indices, b, in the range 1 to 5; such a medium can account for a
CO rotational diagram that is more positively curved than any resulting from an
isothermal medium.

Our method quantifies these differences as a function of both the stellar mass

the precise functional form of the mass function. We applied our technique to
data taken from the ACS Survey for Globular Clusters, from which we obtained
completeness-corrected stellar mass functions in the mass range 0.25-0.75

evolution spanning a range of initial mass functions, total numbers of stars,
concentrations, and virial radii.
  We show that the present-day mass functions of the clusters in our sample can
be reproduced by assuming an universal initial mass function for all clusters,
and that the cluster-to-cluster differences are consistent with what is
expected from two-body relaxation. A more complete exploration of the initial
cluster conditions will be needed in future studies to better constrain the
precise functional form of the initial mass function. This study is a first
step toward using our technique to constrain the dynamical histories of a large
sample of old Galactic star clusters and, by extension, star formation in the

primordial power spectra are parametrized with amplitudes and spectral indices,
and a slow-roll two-field inflation approach where slow-roll parameters are
used as primary parameters. In the phenomenological case, with CMB data, the
upper limit to the CDM isocurvature fraction is \alpha<6.4% at k=0.002Mpc^{-1}

contribution to the CMB temperature variance is -0.030<\alpha_T<0.049.
Including the supernova (or large-scale structure, LSS) data, these limits
become: \alpha<7.0%, 13.7%, and -0.048<\alpha_T< 0.042 (or \alpha<10.2%, 16.0%,

r<0.26 at k=0.01Mpc^{-1}, is not affected by the nonadiabatic modes. In the
slow-roll two-field inflation approach, the spectral indices are constrained
close to 1. This leads to tighter limits on the isocurvature fraction, with the
CMB data \alpha<2.6% at k=0.01Mpc^{-1}, but the constraint on \alpha_T is not
much affected, -0.058<\alpha_T<0.045. Including SN (or LSS) data, these limits
become: \alpha< 3.2% and -0.056<\alpha_T<0.030 (or \alpha<3.4% and
-0.063<\alpha_T<-0.008). When all spectral indices are close to each other the
isocurvature fraction is somewhat degenerate with the tensor-to-scalar ratio.
In addition to the generally correlated models, we study also special cases
where the perturbation modes are uncorrelated or fully (anti)correlated. We
calculate Bayesian evidences (model probabilities) in 21 different cases for
our nonadiabatic models and for the corresponding adiabatic models, and find
that in all cases the data support the pure adiabatic model.

computed evolutionary models covering a broad range in chemical compositions

neglecting or by including a moderate convective core overshooting (beta=0.2)
during central H-burning phases. Models were also constructed either by
neglecting or by assuming a canonical (eta=0.4,0.8) or an enhanced (eta=4) mass
loss rate. The solutions were computed in three different planes:
luminosity-temperature, mass-radius and gravity-temperature. By using the Bayes
Factor, we found that the most probable solutions were obtained in the
gravity-temperature plane with a Gaussian mass prior distribution. The
evolutionary models constructed by assuming a moderate convective core
overshooting (beta=0.2) and a canonical mass loss rate (eta=0.4) give stellar
masses for the primary Cepheid M=4.14^{+0.04}_{-0.05} M_sun and for the
secondary M=4.15^{+0.04}_{-0.05} M_sun that agree at the 1% level with
dynamical measurements. Moreover, we found ages for the two components and for
the combined system t=151^{+4}_{-3} Myr that agree at the 5% level. The
solutions based on evolutionary models that neglect the mass loss attain
similar parameters, while those ones based on models that either account for an
enhanced mass loss or neglect convective core overshooting have lower Bayes
Factors and larger confidence intervals. The dependence on the mass loss rate
might be the consequence of the crude approximation we use to mimic this
phenomenon. By using the isochrone of the most probable solution and a Gaussian
prior on the LMC distance, we found a distance modulus 18.53^{+0.02}_{-0.02}

each energy bin the measured angular power takes approximately the same value

mass, stellar surface mass density, NUV-r colour, and g-i colour gradient. It
is calibrated using samples of nearby galaxies (0.025<z<0.05) with HI line
detections from the GASS and ALFALFA surveys, and it is demonstrated to provide
unbiased M_HI/M_* estimates even for HI-rich galaxies. We apply this estimator
to a sample of ~24,000 galaxies from the SDSS/DR7 in the same redshift range.
We then bin these galaxies by stellar mass and HI mass fraction and compute
projected two point cross-correlation functions with respect to a reference
galaxy sample. Results are compared with predictions from current semi-analytic
models of galaxy formation. The agreement is good for galaxies with stellar
masses larger than 10^10 M_sun, but not for lower mass systems. We then extend
the analysis by studying the bias in the clustering of HI-poor or HI-rich
galaxies with respect to galaxies with normal HI content on scales between 100
kpc and ~5 Mpc. For the HI-deficient population, the strongest bias effects
arise when the HI-deficiency is defined in comparison to galaxies of the same
stellar mass and size. This is not reproduced by the semi-analytic models,
where the quenching of star formation in satellites occurs by ""starvation"" and
does not depend on their internal structure. HI-rich galaxies with masses
greater than 10^10 M_sun are found to be anti-biased compared to galaxies with

matter cosmologies (CWDM). We study their dependence on the fraction and
velocity dispersion of the warm particle, keeping the free-streaming scale
fixed. To this end we consider three models with the same free-streaming: (1) a
mixture of 90% of CDM and 10% of WDM with the mass 1 keV; (2) a mixture of 50%
of CDM and 50% of WDM with the mass 5 keV; and (3) pure WDM with the mass 10
keV. ""Warm"" particles have rescaled Fermi-Dirac spectrum of primordial
velocities (as non-resonantly produced sterile neutrinos would have). We
compare the properties of halos among these models and with a LCDM with the
same cosmological parameters. We demonstrate, that although these models have
the same free-streaming length and the suppression of matter spectra are
similar at scales probed by the Lyman-alpha forest comoving wave-numbers k<3-5
h/Mpc), the resulting properties of halos with masses below 1e11 Msun are
different due to the different behaviour of matter power spectra at smaller
scales. In particular, we find that while the number of galaxies remains the
same as in LCDM case, their density profiles become much less concentrated, and
hence in better agreement with current observational constraints. Our results
imply that a single parameter (e.g. free streaming length) description of these
models is not enough to fully capture their effects on the structure formation
process.

their strange abundance patterns to a combination of pollution from progenitor
stars and in situ extra mixing. In this hybrid theory a first generation of
stars imprint abundance patterns into the gas from which a second generation
forms. The hybrid theory suggests that extra mixing is operating in both
populations and we use the variation of [C/Fe] with luminosity to examine how
efficient this mixing is. We investigate the observed red giant branches of M3,
M13, M92, M15 and NGC 5466 as a means to test a theory of thermohaline mixing.
The second parameter pair M3 and M13 are of intermediate metallicity and our
models are able to account for the evolution of carbon along the RGB in both
clusters. Although, in order to fit the most carbon-depleted main-sequence
stars in M13 we require a model whose initial [C/Fe] abundance leads to a
carbon abundance lower than is observed. Furthermore our results suggest that
stars in M13 formed with some primary nitrogen (higher C+N+O than stars in M3).
In the metal-poor regime only NGC 5466 can be tentatively explained by
thermohaline mixing operating in multiple populations. We find thermohaline
mixing unable to model the depletion of [C/Fe] with magnitude in M92 and M15.
It appears as if extra mixing is occurring before the luminosity function bump
in these clusters. To reconcile the data with the models would require first
dredge-up to be deeper than found in extant models.

method to approximate the full posterior has been developed recently, which

the largest contribution to the likelihood. In this article, we present an
improved algorithm for detecting candidate sources using optimal filters, and
apply it to detect candidate bubble collision signatures in WMAP 7-year

medium (IGM) of the Stephan's Quintet (SQ) group of galaxies. Extremely bright
mid-IR H2 rotational line emission from warm molecular gas has been detected by
Spitzer in the kpc-scale shock created by a galaxy collision. We detect in the
IGM CO(1-0), (2-1) and (3-2) line emission with complex profiles, spanning a
velocity range of 1000 km/s. The spectra exhibit the pre-shock recession
velocities of the two colliding gas systems (5700 and 6700 km/s), but also
intermediate velocities. This shows that much of the molecular gas has formed
out of diffuse gas accelerated by the galaxy-tidal arm collision. A total H2
mass of 5x10^9 Msun is detected in the shock. The molecular gas carries a large
fraction of the gas kinetic energy involved in the collision, meaning that this
energy has not been thermalized yet. The turbulent kinetic energy of the H2 gas
is at least a factor of 5 greater than the thermal energy of the hot plasma
heated by the collision. The ratio between the warm H2 mass derived from
Spitzer IRS spectroscopy and the H2 mass derived from CO fluxes is ~0.3 in the
IGM of SQ, which is 10-100 times higher than in star-forming galaxies. In the
shocked region, the ratio of the PAH-to-CO surface luminosities, commonly used
to measure the star formation efficiency of the H2 gas, is lower (up to a
factor 75) than the observed values in star-forming galaxies. We suggest that
turbulence fed by the galaxy-tidal arm collision maintains a high heating rate
within the H2 gas. This interpretation implies that the velocity dispersion on
the scale of giant molecular clouds in SQ is one order of magnitude larger than
the Galactic value. The high amplitude of turbulence may explain why this gas
is not forming stars efficiently. [abridged version]

restored along certain scaling directions in moduli space. We propose that it
is these symmetry restoring directions, associated with the R-symmetry of the

magnetic gauge bosons as the rho-mesons of the electric theory, colour-flavour
locking allows a simple determination of the parameter ""a"". Its value
continuously interpolates between a=2 on the baryonic branch of moduli space -
corresponding to ""vector meson dominance"" - and a=1 on the mesonic branch. Both
limiting values are consistent with previous results in the literature. The HLS
formalism is further applied to SO and Sp groups, where the usual Seiberg duals
are recovered, as well as adjoint SQCD. Finally we discuss some possible future
applications, including (naturally) the unitarisation of composite W
scattering, blended Higgs/technicolour models, real world QCD and
non-supersymmetric dualities.

chirality of the charge carriers prevents the opening of a band gap and instead
new Dirac points appear in the electronic structure of the material. Graphene
on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) exhibits a rotation dependent Moir\'e pattern.
In this letter, we show experimentally and theoretically that this Moir\'e

models are constructed that include gas-grain interactions. Models including
accretion of gas-phase species onto dust grains and cosmic-ray-induced
desorption of atoms are able to reproduce the observed anion-to-neutral ratios,
as well as the absolute abundances of anionic and neutral carbon chains, with a
reasonable degree of accuracy. Due to their destructive effects, the depletion
of oxygen atoms onto dust results in substantially greater polyyne and anion
abundances in high-density gas (with n_{H_2} >~ 10^5 cm^{-3}). The large
abundances of carbon-chain-bearing species observed in the envelopes of
protostars such as L1527 can thus be explained without the need for warm
carbon-chain chemistry. The C6H- anion-to-neutral ratio is found to be most
sensitive to the atomic O and H abundances and the electron density. Therefore,
as a core evolves, falling atomic abundances and rising electron densities are
found to result in increasing anion-to-neutral ratios. Inclusion of cosmic-ray
desorption of atoms in high-density models delays freeze-out, which results in
a more temporally-stable anion-to-neutral ratio, in better agreement with
observations. Our models include reactions between oxygen atoms and
carbon-chain anions to produce carbon-chain-oxide species C6O, C7O, HC6O and

that the composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) with energies
above $10^{19}$ eV may be dominated by heavy nuclei. An important question is
whether the distribution of arrival directions for such UHECR nuclei can
exhibit observable anisotropy or positional correlations with their
astrophysical source objects despite the expected strong deflections by
intervening magnetic fields. For this purpose, we have simulated the
propagation of UHECR nuclei including models for both the extragalactic
magnetic field and the Galactic magnetic field. Assuming that only iron nuclei
are injected steadily from sources with equal luminosity and spatially
distributed according to the observed large scale structure in the local
Universe, at the number of events published by the PAO so far, the arrival
distribution of UHECRs would be consistent with no auto-correlation at 95%
confidence if the mean number density of UHECR sources $n_s >~ 10^{-6}$
Mpc$^{-3}$, and consistent with no cross-correlation with sources within 95%
errors for $n_s >~ 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. On the other hand, with 1000 events
above $5.5 \times 10^{19}$ eV in the whole sky, next generation experiments can
reveal auto-correlation with more than 99% probability even for $n_s <~
10^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$, and cross-correlation with sources with more than 99%
probability for $n_s <~ 10^{-4}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. In addition, we find that the
contribution of Centaurus A is required to reproduce the currently observed
UHECR excess in the Centaurus region. Secondary protons generated by
photodisintegration of primary heavy nuclei during propagation play a crucial
role in all cases, and the resulting anisotropy at small angular scales should
provide a strong hint of the source location if the maximum energies of the
heavy nuclei are sufficiently high.

outage probability per user, as well as a lower bound on the achievable rate.
This bound is very tight and becomes exact in the large-number-of-antennas
limit. We further study the asymptotic system performance in the regimes of
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), large number of antennas, and large number of
users per cell. We show that at high SNRs, the system is interference-limited
and hence, we cannot improve the system performance by increasing the transmit
power of each user. Instead, by increasing the number of BS antennas, the
effects of interference and noise can be reduced, thereby improving the system
performance. We demonstrate that, with very large antenna arrays at the BS, the
transmit power of each user can be made inversely proportional to the number of
BS antennas while maintaining a desired quality-of-service. Numerical results
are presented to verify our analysis.

4/3; this maximum is attained already for a simple network of two parallel

Coordination Mechanisms.
  We increase the latency functions of the edges in the network, i.e., if
$\ell_e(x)$ is the latency function of an edge $e$, we replace it by
$\hat{\ell}_e(x)$ with $\ell_e(x) \le \hat{\ell}_e(x)$ for all $x$. Then an
adversary fixes a demand rate as input. The engineered Price of Anarchy of the
mechanism is defined as the worst-case ratio of the Nash social cost in the
modified network over the optimal social cost in the original network.
Formally, if $\CM(r)$ denotes the cost of the worst Nash flow in the modified
network for rate $r$ and $\Copt(r)$ denotes the cost of the optimal flow in the
original network for the same rate then [\ePoA = \max_{r \ge 0}

Then, for the case of two parallel links, we describe an optimal mechanism; its

new behavior of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction, which is
the interaction between two magnetic moments mediated by the electrons of the

two equivalent methods both of which may be used for the calculation of the
susceptibility, one involving the integral over a product of two Green's
functions and the second that involves the excitations between occupied and
unoccupied states, which was followed in the original work of Ruderman and
Kittel. Unlike the $J \propto (2k_FR)^{-2} \sin (2k_FR) $ behavior of an
ordinary two-dimensional (2D) metal, $J$ in graphene falls off as $1/R^3$,
shows the $1 + \cos ((\bm{K}-\bm{K'}).\bm{R})$-type of behavior, which contains
an interference term between the two Dirac cones, and it oscillates for certain
directions and not for others. Quite interestingly, irrespective of any
oscillations, the RKKY interaction in graphene is always ferromagnetic for
moments located on the same sublattice and antiferromagnetic for moments on the
opposite sublattices, a result that follows from particle-hole symmetry.

measure of effectiveness in information retrieval, particularly in the legal,

relevance assessment, recall can be estimated by assessing a random sample of
documents; but an indication of the reliability of this estimate is also
required. In this article, we examine several methods for estimating two-tailed
recall confidence intervals. We find that the normal approximation in current

its inappropriate symmetry. Analytic and Bayesian methods based on the ratio of
binomials are generally more accurate, but are inaccurate on small populations.
The method we recommend derives beta-binomial posteriors on retrieved and
unretrieved yield, with fixed hyperparameters, and a Monte Carlo estimate of
the posterior distribution of recall. We demonstrate that this method gives
mean coverage at or near the nominal level, across several scenarios, while
being balanced and stable. We offer advice on sampling design, including the
allocation of assessments to the retrieved and unretrieved segments, and
compare the proposed beta-binomial with the officially reported normal

Pb(Zr$_{0.54}$Ti$_{0.46}$)O$_3$ at the Zr-rich side of the morphotropic phase
boundary at which both intrinsic and extrinsic contributions to

two-phase (rhombohedral $R3c$+monoclinic $Cm$ at room temperature and
$R3c+P4mm$ above 1 GPa pressures) system were studied by high-pressure neutron
powder diffraction technique. The experiments show that applying pressure
favors the $R3c$ phase, whereas the $Cm$ phase transforms continuously to the
$P4mm$, which is favored at elevated temperatures due to the competing entropy
term. The $Cm\rightarrow R3c$ phase transformation is discontinuous. The
transformation contributes to the extrinsic piezoelectricity. An important
contribution to the intrinsic piezoelectricity was revealed: a large
displacement of the $B$ cations (Zr and Ti) with respect to the oxygen anions
is induced by pressure. Above 600 K a phase transition to a cubic phase took
place. Balance between the competing terms dictates the curvature of the phase
boundary. After high-pressure experiments the amount of rhombohedral phase was
larger than initially, suggesting that on the Zr-rich side of the phase
boundary the monoclinic phase is metastable.

spectral information on high redshift Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAE) and quasars
(QSOs). Although LAEs have been proposed as reionization probes, their use is
hampered by the fact their Ly{\alpha} line is damped not only by intergalactic
HI but also internally by dust. Our method allows to overcome such degeneracy.
First, we carefully calibrate a reionization simulation with QSO absorption
line experiments. Then we identify LAEs in two simulation boxes at z=5.7 and
z=6.6 and we build synthetic images/spectra of a prototypical LAE. At redshift
5.7, we find that the Ly{\alpha} transmissivity (T_LAE) ~ 0.25, almost
independent of the halo mass. This constancy arises from the conspiracy of two
effects: (i) the intrinsic Ly{\alpha} line width and (ii) the infall peculiar
velocity. At higher redshift, z=6.6, where the transmissivity is instead
largely set by the local HI abundance and LAE transmissivity consequently
increases with halo mass from 0.15 to 0.3. Although outflows are present, they
are efficiently pressure-confined by infall in a small region around the LAE;
hence they only marginally affect transmissivity. Finally, we cast LOS
originating from background QSOs passing through foreground LAEs at different
impact parameters, and compute the quasar transmissivity (T_QSO). At smaller
impact parameters, d < 1 cMpc, a positive correlation between T_QSO and halo
mass is found at z = 5.7, which tends to become less pronounced (i.e. flatter)
at larger distances. By cross-correlating T_LAE and T_QSO, we can obtain a HI
density estimate unaffected by dust. At z= 5.7, the cross-correlation is
relatively weak,whereas at z = 6.6 we find a clear positive correlation. We
conclude by briefly discussing the perspectives for the application of the
method to existing and forthcoming data.

smaller than the maximum achieved in carbon nanotubes. We show that by
replacing SiO2 with synthetic diamond one can substantially increase the
current-carrying capacity of graphene to as high as ~18 uA/nm2 even at ambient
conditions. Our results indicate that graphene's current-induced breakdown is
thermally activated. We also found that the current carrying capacity of
graphene can be improved not only on the single-crystal diamond substrates but
also on an inexpensive ultrananocrystalline diamond, which can be produced in a
process compatible with a conventional Si technology. The latter was attributed
to the decreased thermal resistance of the ultrananocrystalline diamond layer
at elevated temperatures. The obtained results are important for graphene's

we have obtained Keck/DEIMOS spectra of the compact elliptical (cE) satellite
M32. This is the first resolved-star kinematical study of any cE galaxy. In
contrast to previous studies that extended out to r<30""~1Re~100pc, we measure
the rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile out to r~250"" and higher
order Gauss-Hermite moments out to r~70"". We achieve this by combining
integrated-light spectroscopy at small radii (where crowding/blending are
severe) with resolved stellar spectroscopy at larger radii, using spatial and
kinematical information to statistically account for M31 contamination. The
rotation curve and velocity dispersion profile extend well beyond the radius
(r~150"") where the isophotes are distorted. Unlike NGC 205, another close dwarf
companion of M31, M32's kinematic are regular and symmetric and do not show
obvious sharp gradients across the region of isophotal elongation and twists.
We interpret M32's kinematics using three-integral axisymmetric dynamical
equilibrium models constructed using Schwarzschild's orbit superposition
technique. Models with a constant M/L can fit the data remarkably well.
However, since such a model requires an increasing tangential anisotropy with
radius, invoking the presence of an extended dark halo may be more plausible.
Such an extended dark halo is definitely required to bind a half-dozen
fast-moving stars observed at the largest radii, but these stars may not be an
equilibrium component of M32. The observed regularity of the stellar
kinematics, as well as the possible detection of an extended dark halo, are
unexpected if M31 tides are significant at large radii. While these findings by
themselves do not rule out tidal models for cE formation, they suggest that
tidal stripping may not be as significant for shaping cE galaxies as has often
been argued.

of image subtraction or coaddition. Such methods use a linear decomposition of
the kernel on a series of basis functions. The correct choice of these basis
functions is fundamental to the efficiency and effectiveness of the matching -
the chosen bases should represent the underlying signal using a reasonably
small number of shapes, and/or have a minimum number of user-adjustable tuning
parameters. We examine methods whose bases comprise multiple Gauss-Hermite
polynomials, as well as a form free basis composed of delta-functions. Kernels
derived from delta-functions are unsurprisingly shown to be more expressive;
they are able to take more general shapes and perform better in situations
where sum-of-Gaussian methods are known to fail. However, due to its many
degrees of freedom (the maximum number allowed by the kernel size) this basis
tends to overfit the problem, and yields noisy kernels having large variance.
We introduce a new technique to regularize these delta-function kernel
solutions, which bridges the gap between the generality of delta-function
kernels, and the compactness of sum-of-Gaussian kernels. Through this
regularization we are able to create general kernel solutions that represent
the intrinsic shape of the PSF-matching kernel with only one degree of freedom,
the strength of the regularization lambda. The role of lambda is effectively to
exchange variance in the resulting difference image with variance in the kernel
itself. We examine considerations in choosing the value of lambda, including
statistical risk estimators and the ability of the solution to predict
solutions for adjacent areas. Both of these suggest moderate strengths of
lambda between 0.1 and 1.0, although this optimization is likely dataset
dependent.

three Pb-p orbitals and three Ca-dx2y2 orbitals. Taking these Pb-p and Ca-dx2y2
orbitals as basis wave functions, a tight-binding model is constructed. With
the appropriate choice of the hopping integrals and the strength of the
spin-orbit coupling, the constructed model sucessfully captures important
features of the band structure around the Fermi energy obtained in the
first-principles calculation. By applying the suitable basis transformation and
expanding the matrix elements in the series of the momentum measured from a
Dirac point, the low-energy effective Hamiltonian of this model is explicitely
derived and proved to be a Dirac Hamiltonain. The origin of the mass term is
also discussed. It is shown that the spin-orbit coupling and the orbitals other
than Pb-p and Ca-dx2y2 orbitals play important roles in making the mass term
finite. Finally, the surface band structures of Ca_3PbO for several types of
surfaces are investigated using the constructed tight-binding model. We find

  802.11",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network calculus is a powerful methodology of characterizing queueing
processes and has wide applications, but few works on applying it to 802.11 by
far. In this paper, we take one of the first steps to analyze the backlog
bounds of an 802.11 wireless LAN using stochastic network calculus. In
particular, we want to address its effectiveness on bounding backlogs. We model
a wireless node as a single server with impairment service based on two
best-known models in stochastic network calculus: Jiang's and Ciucu's.
Interestingly, we find that the two models can derive equivalent stochastic
service curves and backlog bounds in our studied case. We prove that the
network-calculus bounds imply stable backlogs as long as the average rate of
traffic arrival is less than that of service, indicating the theoretical
effectiveness of stochastic network calculus in bounding backlogs. From A.
Kumar's 802.11 model, we derive the concrete stochastic service curve of an
802.11 node and its backlog bounds. We compare the derived bounds with ns-2
simulations and find that the former are very loose and we discuss the reasons.
And we show that the martingale and independent case analysis techniques can
improve the bounds significantly. Our work offers a good reference to applying
stochastic network calculus to practical scenarios.

Although CDTs provide a powerful tool for analysing and manipulating ASTs, they
lack a convenient representation of variable binders. In this paper we remedy
this deficiency by combining the framework of CDTs with Chlipala's parametric
higher-order abstract syntax (PHOAS). We show how a generalisation from
functors to difunctors enables us to capture PHOAS while still maintaining the
features of the original implementation of CDTs, in particular its modularity.
Unlike previous approaches, we avoid so-called exotic terms without resorting
to abstract types: this is crucial when we want to perform transformations on
CDTs that inspect the recursively computed CDTs, e.g. constant folding.

of the ${}^{13}$C nuclei. Due to the valley and spin degrees of freedom four
bounded states exist for any given longitudinal mode in the quantum dot. At
zero magnetic field the spin-orbit coupling and the valley mixing split those
four states into two Kramers doublets. The valley mixing term for a given dot
is determined by the intra-dot disorder and therefore the states in the Kramers
doublets belonging to different dots are different. We show how nonzero
single-particle interdot tunneling amplitudes between states belonging to
different doublets give rise to new avoided crossings, as a function of
detuning, in the relevant two particle spectrum, crossing over from the two
electrons in one dot states configuration, $(0,2)$, to the one electron in each

Landau-Zener processes affect the separation and the joining stages of each
single-shot measurement and they affect the outcome of the measurement in a way
that strongly depends on the initial state. We find that a well-defined return
probability experiment is realized when, at each single-shot cycle, the (0,2)
ground state is prepared. In this case, valley mixing increases the saturation
value of the measured return probability, whereas the probability to return to
the (0,2) ground state remains unchanged. Finally, we study the effect of the
valley mixing in the high magnetic field limit; for a parallel magnetic field
the predictions coincide with a clean nanotube, while the disorder effect is
always relevant with a magnetic field perpendicular to the nanotube axis.

medium, metals (elements heavier than helium), and dust. We start from a review
of time-evolutionary equations of the four components, and then, we present
simple recipes for the stellar remnant mass and yields of metal and dust based
on models of stellar nucleosynthesis and dust formation. After calibrating some
model parameters with the data from the solar neighborhood, we have confirmed a
shortage of the stellar dust production rate relative to the dust destruction
rate by supernovae if the destruction efficiency suggested by theoretical works
is correct. If the dust mass growth by material accretion in molecular clouds
is active, the observed dust amount in the solar neighborhood is reproduced. We
present a clear analytic explanation of the mechanism for determining dust
content in galaxies after the activation of accretion growth: a balance between
accretion growth and supernova destruction. Thus, the dust content is
independent of the uncertainty of the stellar dust yield after the growth
activation. The timing of the activation is determined by a critical metal mass
fraction which depends on the growth and destruction efficiencies. The solar
system formation seems to have occurred well after the activation and plenty of

boundary force particles, and the turbulence is initiated by a set of gaussian
vortices. In the case of fixed boxes we recover the results of Clercx and his
colleagues obtained using both a high accuracy spectral method and experiments.
Our results for fixed boxes are also in close agreement with those of Monaghan1
and Robinson and Monaghan2 obtained using SPH. A feature of decaying turbulence
in no-slip, square, fixed boundaries is that the angular momentum of the fluid
varies with time because of the reaction on the fluid of the viscous stresses
on the boundary. We find that when the box is allowed to rotate freely, so that
the total angular momentum of box and fluid is constant, the change in the
angular momentum of the fluid is a factor ~ 500 smaller than is the case for
the fixed box, and the final vorticity distribution is different. We also
simulate the behaviour of the turbulence when the box is forced to rotate with
small and large Rossby number, and the turbulence is initiated by gaussian
vortices as before. If the rotation of the box is maintained after the
turbulence is initiated we find that in the rotating frame the decay of kinetic
energy, enstrophy and the vortex structure is insensitive to the angular
velocity of the box. On the other hand, If the box is allowed to rotate freely
after the turbulence is initiated, the evolved vortex structure is completely
different.

  Binary Joint Network-Channel Coding","Submitted to Eurasip Journ. on Wir. Comm. and Netw",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Joint network-channel codes (JNCC) can improve the performance of
communication in wireless networks, by combining, at the physical layer, the
channel codes and the network code as an overall error-correcting code. JNCC is
increasingly proposed as an alternative to a standard layered construction,
such as the OSI-model. The main performance metrics for JNCCs are scalability
to larger networks and error rate. The diversity order is one of the most
important parameters determining the error rate. The literature on JNCC is
growing, but a rigorous diversity analysis is lacking, mainly because of the
many degrees of freedom in wireless networks, which makes it very hard to prove
general statements on the diversity order. In this paper, we consider a network
with slowly varying fading point-to-point links, where all sources also act as
relay and additional non-source relays may be present. We propose a general
structure for JNCCs to be applied in such network. In the relay phase, each
relay transmits a linear transform of a set of source codewords. Our main
contributions are the proposition of an upper and lower bound on the diversity
order, a scalable code design and a new lower bound on the word error rate to
asses the performance of the network code. The lower bound on the diversity
order is only valid for JNCCs where the relays transform only two source
codewords. We then validate this analysis with an example which compares the
JNCC performance to that of a standard layered construction. Our numerical
results suggest that as networks grow, it is difficult to perform significantly
better than a standard layered construction, both on a fundamental level,
expressed by the outage probability, as on a practical level, expressed by the
word error rate.

T dependence is roughly linear below 2 K and tends to saturate at higher T.
Perpendicular magnetic fields on the order of a few 10 mT suppress the

applications including wavelength conversion [4], optical regeneration [5,6],
optical delay [7], time-domain demultiplexing[8], temporal cloaking[9] and
negative refraction[10]. Although FWM has been observed in several media
including chalcogenides [11,12,13,14], silicon[15, 16], bismuth [17] and silica
[18,19], there is a continued quest for devices that realize efficient and
broadband FWM while offering compactness, low-power consumption and
compatibility with optical fibers. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of 10

watt threshold (70-370 mW) wavelength conversion with a 12 dB bandwidth as

is the first evidence of CP violation in charm system, which may indicate new
physics beyond the Standard Model. Motivated by this measurement, we review
rare processes in charmonium decay, especially, the weak decay, $C$ or $P$
violated decay and lepton flavor violated decays. In case the new physics
appears in charm sector, these rare decays of charmonium states will provide
opportunity to search for significant contributions from physics beyond the

normal state properties of unconventional superconductors. In particular, it
may sensitively detect Fermi surface reconstructions which are connected to a
charge or spin density wave (SDW) ordered state, and even fluctuating forms of
such a state. Here we summarize recent results for the Nernst effect of the
iron pnictide superconductor $\rm LaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$, whose ground state evolves
upon doping from an itinerant SDW to a superconducting state, and the cuprate
superconductor $\rm La_{1.8-x}Eu_{0.2}Sr_xCuO_4$ which exhibits static stripe
order as a ground state competing with the superconductivity. In $\rm
LaO_{1-x}F_xFeAs$, the SDW order leads to a huge Nernst response, which allows
to detect even fluctuating SDW precursors at superconducting doping levels
where long range SDW order is suppressed. This is in contrast to the impact of
stripe order on the normal state Nernst effect in $\rm
La_{1.8-x}Eu_{0.2}Sr_xCuO_4$. Here, though signatures of the stripe order are
detectable in the temperature dependence of the Nernst coefficient, its overall
temperature dependence is very similar to that of $\rm La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$,
where stripe order is absent. The anomalies which are induced by the stripe
order are very subtle and the enhancement of the Nernst response due to static
stripe order in $\rm La_{1.8-x}Eu_{0.2}Sr_xCuO_4$ as compared to that of the
pseudogap phase in $\rm La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$, if any, is very small.

American authors. By investigating the collective dimensions of these works,
this paper sheds light on the tension between the tacit and the explicit in the
ways some groups of texts hold together, thereby constituting some shared
algebraic cultures. Although prominent algebraists such as Dickson made
extensive references to papers published in France, and despite the roles
played by algebra and arithmetic in the development of the American
mathematical community, our knowledge of the circulations of knowledge between
France and the United States at the beginning of the 20th century is still very
limited. It is my aim to tackle such issues through the case study of a
specific collective approach to finite group theory at the turn of the 20th
century. This specific approach can be understood as a shared algebraic culture
based on the long run circulation of some specific procedures of decompositions
of the analytic forms of substitutions. In this context, the general linear
group was introduced as the maximal group in which an elementary abelian group
(i.e., the multiplicative group of a Galois field) is a normal subgroup.

baryons in galaxies with gas are partitioned into stars, atomic and molecular
gas as a function of galaxy stellar mass and surface density. The models do not
reproduce the tight observed relation between stellar surface density and
bulge-to-disk ratio for this population. We then turn to an analysis of
the""quenched"" population of galaxies without detectable cold gas. The current
implementation of radio-mode feedback in the models disagrees strongly with the
data. In the models, gas cooling shuts down in nearly all galaxies in dark
matter halos above a mass of 10**12 M_sun. As a result, stellar mass is the
observable that best predicts whether a galaxy has little or no neutral gas. In
contrast, our data show that quenching is largely independent of stellar mass.
Instead, there are clear thresholds in bulge-to-disk ratio and in stellar
surface density that demarcate the location of quenched galaxies. We propose
that processes associated with bulge formation play a key role in depleting the
neutral gas in galaxies and that further gas accretion is suppressed following
the formation of the bulge, even in dark matter halos of low mass.

the line defined by any two points of an ovoid is skew-symmetric, as is the
nucleus of the conic defined by any three points of an ovoid. Each ovoid thus
yields 36/84 elements of the former/latter type, accounting for all 120
skew-symmetric elements of the group. There are a number of notable types of
ovoid-associated subgeometries of the group, of which we mention the following:
a subset of 12 skew-symmetric elements lying on four mutually skew lines that
span the whole ambient space, a subset of 15 symmetric elements that
corresponds to two ovoids sharing three points, a subset of 19 symmetric
elements generated by two ovoids on a common point, a subset of 27 symmetric
elements that can be partitioned into three ovoids in two unique ways, a subset
of 27 skew-symmetric elements that exhibits a 15 + 2 x 6 split reminding that
exhibited by an elliptic quadric of PG(5,2), and a subset of seven
skew-symmetric elements formed by the nuclei of seven conics having two points

ground-state to ground-state transitions and physical interpretation of these
probabilities are discussed. Probabilities are often calculated by
approximating both ground states, of the initial nucleus A and of the final
nucleus A\pm 2 by the same quasiparticle vacuum. We analyze two improvements of
this approach. First, the effect of using two different ground states with
average numbers of particles A and A\pm2 is quantified. Second, by using
projection techniques, the role of particle number restoration is analyzed. Our
analysis shows that the improved treatment plays a role close to magicity,
leading to an enhancement of the pair-transfer probability. In mid-shell
regions, part of the error made by approximating the initial and final ground
states by a single vacuum is compensated by projecting onto good particle
number. Surface effects are analyzed by using pairing interactions with a
different volume-to-surface mixing. Finally, a simple expression of the
pair-transfer probability is given in terms of occupation probabilities in the
canonical basis. We show that, in the canonical basis formulation, surface
effects which are visible in the transfer probability are related to the
fragmentation of single-particle occupancies close to the Fermi energy. This
provides a complementary interpretation with respect to the standard
quasiparticle representation where surface effects are generated by the
integrated radial profiles of the contributing wave functions.

et al proposed differentiated planetesimals that were formed in the region of
1-2 AU during the first 1.5 Myr, as the parent bodies, and suggested that these
objects and their fragments were scattered into the asteroid belt as a result
of interactions with planetary embryos. Although viable, this model does not
include the effect of a giant planet that might have existed or been growing in
the outer regions. We present the results of a concept study where we have
examined the effect of a planetary body in the orbit of Jupiter on the early
scattering of planetesimals from terrestrial region into the asteroid belt. We
integrated the orbits of a large battery of planetesimals in a disk of
planetary embryos, and studied their evolutions for different values of the
mass of the planet. Results indicate that when the mass of the planet is
smaller than 10 Earth-masses, its effects on the interactions among
planetesimals and planetary embryos is negligible. However, when the planet
mass is between 10 and 50 Earth-masses, simulations point to a transitional
regime with ~50 Earth-mass being the value for which the perturbing effect of
the planet can no longer be ignored. Simulations also show that further
increase of the mass of the planet strongly reduces the efficiency of the
scattering of planetesimals from the terrestrial planet region into the
asteroid belt. We present the results of our simulations and discuss their
possible implications for the time of giant planet formation.

induced from random acceleration on LISA proof mass in the frequency domain.
The drift must be cleaned from LISA time series data in advance of any further
analysis. The cleaning is usually performed in the time domain by using a
quadratic function to fit the time series data, and then removing the fitted
part from the data. Having Fourier transformed the residuals, and then
convolved with LISA transfer function, LISA sensitivity curve can be obtained.
However, cosmic gravitational-wave background cannot be retrieved with this
approach due to its random nature. Here we provide a new representation of
power spectrum given by discrete Fourier transform, which is applied to find
the function of the drift power for the cleaning in the frequency domain. We
also give the probability distribution used to analyze the data in the
frequency domain. We combine several techniques, including Markov Chain Monte
Carlo method, simulated annealing, and Gelman & Rubin's method, with Baye's
theorem to build the algorithm. The algorithm is utilized to analyze 24
simulations of LISA instrumental noise. We prove that the LISA sensitivity can
be recovered through this approach. It can help us to build algorithms for some
tasks which are must accomplished in the frequency domain for LISA data
analysis. This method can be applied to other space-borne interferometers if
charges on their proof masses cannot be perfectly cancelled.

studied via properties of the density matrix's partial transpose,
$\rho_{12}^{T_2}$. The density of states of $\rho_{12}^{T_2}$ is close to the
semicircle law when both subsystems have dimensions which are not too small and
are of the same order. A simple random matrix model for the partial transpose
is found to capture the entanglement properties well, including a transition
across a critical dimension. Log-negativity is used to quantify entanglement
between subsystems and analytic formulas for this are derived based on the
simple model. The skewness of the eigenvalue density of $\rho_{12}^{T_2}$ is
derived analytically, using the average of the third moment over the ensemble
of random pure states. The third moment after partial transpose is also shown
to be related to a generalization of the Kempe invariant. The smallest
eigenvalue after partial transpose is found to follow the extreme value
statistics of random matrices, namely the Tracy-Widom distribution. This
distribution, with relevant parameters obtained from the model, is found to be
useful in calculating the fraction of entangled states at critical dimensions.
These results are tested in a quantum dynamical system of three coupled
standard maps, where one finds that if the parameters represent a strongly
chaotic system, the results are close to those of random states, although there
are some systematic deviations at critical dimensions.

  Aims. To find simple recipes to compute the radiative energy balance in the
dominant lines under solar chromospheric conditions.
  Methods. We use detailed calculations in time-dependent and 2D MHD snapshots
to derive empirical formulae for the radiative cooling and heating.
  Results. The radiative cooling in neutral hydrogen lines and the Lyman
continuum, the H and K and intrared triplet lines of singly ionized calcium and
the h and k lines of singly ionized magnesium can be written as a product of an
optically thin emission (dependent on temperature), an escape probability
(dependent on column mass) and an ionization fraction (dependent on
temperature). In the cool pockets of the chromosphere the same transitions
contribute to the heating of the gas and similar formulae can be derived for
these processes. We finally derive a simple recipe for the radiative heating of
the chromosphere from incoming coronal radiation. We compare our recipes with

and the Loschmidt echo is established, holding for a two-level system (qubit)
undergoing pure dephasing due to a coupling with a many-body environment. We
show that the Loschmidt echo is intimately related to the information flowing
out from and occasionally back into the system. This, in turn, determines the
non-Markovianity of the reduced dynamics. In particular, we consider a central
qubit coupled to a quantum Ising ring in the transverse field. In this context,
the information flux between system and environment is strongly affected by the
environmental criticality; the qubit dynamics is shown to be Markovian exactly
and only at the critical point. Therefore non-Markovianity is an indicator of
criticality in the model considered here.

causes high radio congestions and severe access delay. To address this issue,
we propose a Fast Adaptive S-ALOHA (FASA) scheme for M2M communication systems

the tracking process of network status. Furthermore, the fast convergence

demonstrate that the proposed FASA scheme achieves near-optimal performance in
reducing access delay, which outperforms that of traditional additive schemes
such as PB-ALOHA. Moreover, compared to multiplicative schemes, FASA shows its
robustness even under heavy traffic load in addition to better delay
performance.

flux. For sources of the local universe we use forward tracking through
realistic matter distributions and magnetic fields resulting from explicit
simulations of large-scale structure formation. From the calculations and the
forward tracking we generate maps of the probability to observe a particle with
a given energy from a discrete direction. To account for deflections in the
galactic field, these probability maps are transformed by matrices calculated
from backtracking of antiparticles through field parameterizations. Based on
the combined probability maps, Monte Carlo production of individual UHECR data
is performed which are then used in comparisons with UHECR measurements. The
simulated UHECR data serves for optimizing the analysis techniques used in
UHECR measurements as well as for constraining the parameter space of the
underlying source and magnetic field models.

interactions. Elucidating network properties that distinguish disease from the
healthy cellular state is therefore of critical importance for gaining
systems-level insights into disease mechanisms and ultimately for developing
improved therapies. By integrating gene expression data with a protein
interaction network to induce a stochastic dynamics on the network, we here
demonstrate that cancer cells are characterised by an increase in the dynamic
network entropy, compared to cells of normal physiology. Using a fundamental
relation between the macroscopic resilience of a dynamical system and the
uncertainty (entropy) in the underlying microscopic processes, we argue that
cancer cells will be more robust to random gene perturbations. In addition, we
formally demonstrate that gene expression differences between normal and cancer
tissue are anticorrelated with local dynamic entropy changes, thus providing a
systemic link between gene expression changes at the nodes and their local
network dynamics. In particular, we also find that genes which drive
cell-proliferation in cancer cells and which often encode oncogenes are
associated with reductions in the dynamic network entropy. In summary, our
results support the view that the observed increased robustness of cancer cells
to perturbation and therapy may be due to an increase in the dynamic network
entropy that allows cells to adapt to the new cellular stresses. Conversely,
genes that exhibit local flux entropy decreases in cancer may render cancer
cells more susceptible to targeted intervention and may therefore represent
promising drug targets.

explain the current existence of cosmological magnetic fields. Assuming
conformal invariance to be restored after inflation, their energy density
decreases as radiation during the decelerating eras of the universe, and in
particular during reheating. Without making any assumptions on inflation, on
the magnetogenesis mechanism and on how the reheating proceeded, we show that
requiring large scale magnetic fields to remain subdominant after inflation
gives non-trivial constraints on both the reheating equation of state parameter
and the reheating energy scale. In terms of the so-called reheating parameter,
we find that ln(Rrad) > -10.1 for large scale magnetic fields of the order 5 x
10^(-15) Gauss today. This bound is then compared to those already derived from
Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data by assuming a specific inflationary
model. Avoiding magnetic field backreaction is always complementary to CMB and
can give more stringent limits on reheating for all high energy models of
inflation. For instance, a large field matter dominated reheating cannot take
place at an energy scale lower than typically 500 GeV if the magnetic field
strength today is Bo = 5 x 10^(-15) G, this scale going up to 10^(10) GeV if Bo
= 10^(-9) G.

highlighted in the recent financial crisis. Defaults tend to cluster around
times of economic stress due to poor macro-economic conditions, {\em but also}
by directly triggering each other through contagion. Although credit default
swaps have radically altered the dynamics of contagion for more than a decade,
models quantifying their impact on systemic risk are still missing. Here, we
examine contagion through credit default swaps in a stylized economic network
of corporates and financial institutions. We analyse such a system using a
stochastic setting, which allows us to exploit limit theorems to exactly solve
the contagion dynamics for the entire system. Our analysis shows that, by
creating additional contagion channels, CDS can actually lead to greater
instability of the entire network in times of economic stress. This is
particularly pronounced when CDS are used by banks to expand their loan books
(arguing that CDS would offload the additional risks from their balance
sheets). Thus, even with complete hedging through CDS, a significant loan book
expansion can lead to considerably enhanced probabilities for the occurrence of
very large losses and very high default rates in the system. Our approach adds
a new dimension to research on credit contagion, and could feed into a rational
underpinning of an improved regulatory framework for credit derivatives.

air shower array, the surface component of the IceCube Neutrino Observatory at
the South Pole. The data used in this analysis were taken between June and
October, 2007, with 26 surface stations operational at that time, corresponding
to about one third of the final array. The fiducial area used in this analysis
was 0.122 km^2. The analysis investigated the energy spectrum from 1 to 100 PeV
measured for three different zenith angle ranges between 0{\deg} and 46{\deg}.
Because of the isotropy of cosmic rays in this energy range the spectra from
all zenith angle intervals have to agree. The cosmic-ray energy spectrum was
determined under different assumptions on the primary mass composition. Good
agreement of spectra in the three zenith angle ranges was found for the
assumption of pure proton and a simple two-component model. For zenith angles
{\theta} < 30{\deg}, where the mass dependence is smallest, the knee in the
cosmic ray energy spectrum was observed between 3.5 and 4.32 PeV, depending on
composition assumption. Spectral indices above the knee range from -3.08 to
-3.11 depending on primary mass composition assumption. Moreover, an indication
of a flattening of the spectrum above 22 PeV were observed.

of activity of the symbiotic binary Z And from 2006 to 2010. We estimate the
temperature of the hot component of Z And to be \approx 150000 - 170000 K at
minimum brightness, decreasing to \approx 90000 K at the brightness maximum.
Our estimate of the electron density in the gaseous nebula is
N_{e}=10^{10}-10^{12} cm^{-3} in the region of formation of lines of neutral
helium and 10^6-10^7 cm^{-3} in the region of formation of the [OIII] and
[NeIII] nebular lines. A trend for the gas density derived from helium lines to
increase and the gas density derived from [OIII] and [NeIII] lines to
simultaneously decrease with increasing brightness of the system was observed.
Our estimates show that the ratios of the theoretical and observed fluxes in
the [OIII] and [NeIII] lines agree best when the O/Ne ratio is similar to its
value for planetary nebulae. The model spectral energy distribution showed
that, in addition to a cool component and gaseous nebula, a relatively cool
pseudophotosphere (5250-11 500 K) is present in the system. The simultaneous
presence of a relatively cool pseudophotosphere and high-ionization spectral
lines is probably related to a disk-like structure of the pseudophotosphere.
The pseudophotosphere formed very rapidly, over several weeks, during a period
of increasing brightness of Z And. We infer that in 2009, as in 2006, the
activity of the system was accompanied by a collimated bipolar ejection of
matter. In contrast to the situation in 2006, the jets were detected even
before the system reached its maximum brightness. Moreover, components with
velocities close to 1200 km/s disappeared at the maximum, while those with
velocities close to 1800 km/s appeared.

same universality class as the model of surface relaxation to the minimum

broadness $\lambda$, the steady state of the fluctuations scales with the
system size $N$ as a constant for $\lambda \geq 3$ and has a logarithmic
divergence for $\lambda < 3$ [Pastore y Piontti {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. E {\bf

the fluctuations for the SRAM model scale as in the SRM model. We also derive
analytically the evolution equation for this model for any kind of complex
graphs and find that, as in the SRM model, non-linear terms appear due to the
heterogeneity and the lack of symmetry of the network. In spite of that, the
two models have the same scaling, but the SRM model is more efficient to

C17O(2-1) with APEX. Selected positions were also observed in the 13CO(2-1),
SiO(5-4), and CH3OH(5_k-4_k) transitions at ~1 mm wavelength. The C17O lines
were detected towards all target positions at similar radial velocities,
indicating that G304.74 is a coherent filamentary structure. CO does not appear
to be significantly depleted in the clumps. Two- to three methanol 5_k-4_k
lines near ~241.8 GHz were detected towards all selected target positions,
whereas SiO(5-4) was seen in only one of these positions. The 13CO(2-1) lines
show blue asymmetric profiles, indicating large-scale infall motions. The
clumps show trans- to supersonic non-thermal motions, and virial-parameter
analysis suggests that most of them are gravitationally bound. The external
pressure may also play a non-negligible role in the dynamics. This is
qualitatively consistent with our earlier suggestion that the filament was
formed by converging supersonic turbulent flows. The analysis suggests that the
fragmentation of the filament into clumps is caused by ""sausage""-type
instability, in agreement with results from other IRDCs. The star-formation
activity in the cloud, such as outflows, is likely responsible in releasing CO
from the icy grain mantles back into the gas phase. Shocks related to outflows
may have also injected CH3OH, SiO, and DCN into the gas-phase in SMM 3.

BEC scheme where we found a quantum synchronism condition providing an
effective Hamiltonian of magnon qubit. It has the form of well-known
superconducting Josephson qubit. The possibilities for coherent magnon BEC
qubit rotation are analyzed. Implementations of the magnon BEC qubit are
considered for small samples and thin ferromagnetic films. Advantages of the

existence of sources (the soft gamma repeaters and the anomalous X-ray pulsars)
hosting an ultra-magnetized neutron star (or magnetar) has been recognized in
the past few decades. Magnetars are believed to be powered by magnetic energy
and not by rotation, as with normal radio pulsars. Until recently, the radio
quietness and magnetic fields typically above the quantum critical value
(Bq~4.4x10^{13} G), were among the characterizing properties of magnetars. The
recent discovery of radio pulsed emission from a few of them, and of a low
dipolar magnetic field soft gamma repeater, weakened further the idea of a
clean separation between normal pulsars and magnetars. In this Letter we show
that radio emission from magnetars might be powered by rotational energy,
similarly to what occurs in normal radio pulsars. The peculiar characteristics
of magnetars radio emission should be traced in the complex magnetic geometry
of these sources. Furthermore, we propose that magnetar radio activity or
inactivity can be predicted from the knowledge of the star's rotational period,
its time derivative and the quiescent X-ray luminosity.

World Wide Web, social and biological networks are often characterized by
degree-degree {dependencies} between neighbouring nodes. One of the problems
with the commonly used Pearson's correlation coefficient (termed as the
assortativity coefficient) is that {in disassortative networks its magnitude
decreases} with the network size. This makes it impossible to compare mixing
patterns, for example, in two web crawls of different size.
  We start with a simple model of two heavy-tailed highly correlated random
variable $X$ and $Y$, and show that the sample correlation coefficient
converges in distribution either to a proper random variable on $[-1,1]$, or to
zero, and if $X,Y\ge 0$ then the limit is non-negative. We next show that it is
non-negative in the large graph limit when the degree distribution has an
infinite third moment. We consider the alternative degree-degree dependency
measure, based on the Spearman's rho, and prove that it converges to an
appropriate limit under very general conditions. We verify that these
conditions hold in common network models, such as configuration model and
Preferential Attachment model. We conclude that rank correlations provide a
suitable and informative method for uncovering network mixing patterns.

ionization structure in the [SII]/[OIII] ratio and Ha surface brightness. The
luminosity functions from these catalogs generally agree with those from
Ha-only surveys. We then use ionization-parameter mapping to crudely classify
all the nebulae into optically thick vs optically thin categories, yielding
fundamental new insights into Lyman continuum radiation transfer. We find that
in both galaxies, the frequency of optically thin objects correlates with Ha
luminosity, and that the numbers of these objects dominate above log L\geq37.0.
The frequencies of optically thin objects are 40% and 33% in the LMC and SMC,
respectively. Similarly, the frequency of optically thick regions correlates
with H I column density, with optically thin objects dominating at the lowest
N(HI). The integrated escape luminosity of ionizing radiation is dominated by
the largest regions, and corresponds to luminosity-weighted, ionizing escape
fractions from the H II region population of \geq0.42 and \geq0.40 in the LMC
and SMC, respectively. These values correspond to global galactic escape
fractions of 4% and 11%, respectively. This is sufficient to power the
ionization rate of the observed diffuse ionized gas in both galaxies. Our
results suggest the possibility of significant galactic escape fractions of

relations defining the Planck's mass, length, and time), then the gravitational
constant and permitivity of vacuum can be eliminated from the equation. In
addition, the equation becomes dimensionless containing only the ratios of
distances, velocities, masses, and electric charges. The ratios of masses and
charges can further be replaced with the ratios of wave-lengths or frequencies.
The corresponding equation of motion implies that the fundamental physical
constants as the gravitational constant, permitivity of vacuum, and Planck
constant are, likely, mere the transformation constants between artificial
quantities as mass and electric charge, which were established by man to
communicate some concerning things and events in every-day life, and natural
physical quantities as wave-length or frequency of oscillations of waving
space-time.
