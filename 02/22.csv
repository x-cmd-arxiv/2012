equilibrium dynamics of a half-filled Hubbard-Holstein model of correlated
electrons interacting with local phonons. Inspired by pump-probe experiments,
where intense light pulses selectively induce optical excitations that trigger
a transient out-of-equilibrium dynamics, here we inject energy in the Hubbard
bands by a non-equilibrium population of empty and doubly-occupied sites. We
first consider the case of a global perturbation, acting over the whole sample,
and find evidence of a mean-field dynamical transition where the lattice gets
strongly distorted above a certain energy threshold, despite the weak strength
of the electron-phonon coupling by comparison with the Hubbard repulsion. Next,
we address a slab geometry for a correlated heterostructure and study the
relaxation dynamics across the system when the perturbation acts locally on the
first layer. While for weak deviations from equilibrium the excited surface is
able to relax by transferring its excess energy to the bulk, for large
deviations the excess energy stays instead concentrated into the surface layer.
This self-trapping occurs both in the absence as well as in the presence of
electron-phonon coupling. Phonons actually enforce the trapping by distorting
at the surface.

attention. The approach that addresses the reconstruction of the dimensionless
coordinate distance and its two first derivatives using a polynomial fit in
different redshift windows is well developed
\cite{DalyDjorgovski1,DalyDjorgovski2,DalyDjorgovski3}. In this work we offer
new insights into the problem by focusing on two types of observational probes:
SNeIa and GRBs. Our results allow to highlight some of the intrinsic weaknesses
of the method. One of the directions we follow is to consider updated
observational samples. Our results indicate than conclusions on the main dark
energy features as drawn from this method are intimately related to the
features of the samples themselves (which are not quite ideal). This is
particularly true of GRBs, which manifest themselves as poor performers in this
context. In contrast to original works, we conclude they cannot be used for
cosmological purposes, and the state of the art does not allow to regard them
on the same quality basis as SNeIa. The next direction we contribute to is the
question of how the adjusting of some parameters (window width, overlap,
selection criteria) affect the results. We find again there is a considerable
sensitivity to these features. Then, we try to establish what is the current
redshift range for which one can make solid predictions on dark energy
evolution. Finally, we strengthen the former view that this model is modest in
the sense it provides only a picture of the global trend. But, on the other
hand, we believe it offers an interesting complement to other approaches given
that it works on minimal assumptions.

interactions to the lipid head groups. Depending on the parameters, we observe
four classes of dynamical trajectories: particle adhesion to the membrane,
stalled partially wrapped states, budding followed by scission, and membrane
rupture. In most regions of parameter space we find that the elastic theory
agrees nearly quantitatively with the simulated phase behavior as a function of
adhesion strength, membrane bending rigidity, and particle radius. However, at
parameter values near the transition between particle adhesion and budding, we
observe long-lived partially wrapped states which are not captured by existing
elastic theories. These states could constrain the accessible system parameters
for those enveloped viruses or drug delivery vehicles which rely on exo- or
endocytosis for membrane transport.

Long-term Swift monitoring allow us to examine correlations between the UV,

general theory of stochastic processes [A. Plyasunov and A. P. Arkin, J. Comp.
Phys. 221, 724 (2007)]. We build on these results to show how the method can be
used to compute steady-state sensitivity coefficients from a single simulation
run, and we present various efficiency improvements. For models of biochemical
signaling networks the method has a particularly simple implementation. We
demonstrate its application to a signaling network showing stochastic focussing
and to a bistable genetic switch, and present exact results for models with
linear propensity functions.

B",,"10.1103/PhysRevB.85.115412",,"cond-mat.mes-hall physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An exact method to compute the entire equilibrium reduced density matrix for
systems characterized by a system-bath Hamiltonian is presented. The approach
is based upon a stochastic unraveling of the influence functional that appears
in the imaginary time path integral formalism of quantum statistical mechanics.
This method is then applied to study the effects of thermal noise, static
disorder, and temperature on the coherence length in excitonic systems. As
representative examples of biased and unbiased systems, attention is focused on
the well-characterized light harvesting complexes of FMO and LH2, respectively.
Due to the bias, FMO is completely localized in the site basis at low
temperatures, whereas LH2 is completely delocalized. In the latter, the
presence of static disorder leads to a plateau in the coherence length at low
temperature that becomes increasingly pronounced with increasing strength of
the disorder. The introduction of noise, however, precludes this effect. In
biased systems, it is shown that the environment may increase the coherence
length, but only decrease that of unbiased systems. Finally it is emphasized
that for typical values of the environmental parameters in light harvesting
systems, the system and bath are entangled at equilibrium in the single
excitation manifold. That is, the density matrix cannot be described as a
product state as is often assumed, even at room temperature. The reduced
density matrix of LH2 is shown to be in precise agreement with the steady state
limit of previous exact quantum dynamics calculations.

aspects of the quantities that are used to implement a game. If a game is to be
played, it has to be played with objects and actions that have some physical
existence. We call such games playable. By focusing on the notion of
playability for games we can more clearly see the distinction between classical
and quantum games and tackle the thorny issue of what it means to quantize a
game. The approach we take can more properly be thought of as gaming the
quantum rather than quantizing a game and we find that in this perspective we
can think of a complete quantum game, for a given set of preferences, as
representing a single family of quantum games with many different playable
versions. The versions of Quantum Prisoners Dilemma presented in the literature
can therefore be thought of specific instances of the single family of Quantum
Prisoner's Dilemma with respect to a particular measurement. The conditions for
equilibrium are given for playable quantum games both in terms of expected
outcomes and a geometric approach. We discuss how any quantum game can be
simulated with a classical game played with classical coins as far as the
strategy selections and expected outcomes are concerned.

range of waveforms and amplitudes. This variety is a result of different
physical conditions affecting the ion currents through a cellular membrane. The
transmembrane currents are often considered by macroscopic membrane models as
essentially a homogeneous process. However, this assumption is doubtful, since
ions move through ion channels, which are scattered within the membrane.
Accounting for this fact, the present work proposes a theoretical model of
heterogeneous membrane conductivity. The model is based on the hypothesis that
both potential and charge are distributed inhomogeneously on the membrane
surface, concentrated near channel pores, as the direct consequence of the
inhomogeneous transmembrane current. A system of continuity equations having
non-stationary and quasi-stationary forms expresses this fact mathematically.
The present work performs mathematical analysis of the proposed equations,
following by the synthesis of the equivalent electric element of a
heterogeneous membrane current. This element is further used to construct a
model of the cell-surface electric junction in a form of the equivalent
electrical circuit. After that a study of how the heterogeneous membrane
conductivity affects parameters of the extracellular electrical signal is
performed. As the result it was found that variation of the passive
characteristics of the cell-surface junction, conductivity of the cleft and the
cleft height, could lead to different shapes of the extracellular signals.

with the results from our CP asymmetry measurements in B_s -> J/psi phi decays,
we conclude that the B_s mass eigenstate that is almost CP =+1 is lighter and
decays faster than the mass eigenstate that is almost CP =-1. This determines
the sign of the decay width difference DeltaGamma_s == Gamma_L -Gamma_H to be
positive. Our result also resolves the ambiguity in the past measurements of
the CP violating phase phi_s to be close to zero rather than pi. These
conclusions are in agreement with the Standard Model expectations.

could be due to an obscuring high-altitude haze of an unknown composition or a
significantly sub-solar NaI abundance hiding the line wings beneath a H2
Rayleigh signature. We compare the spectral absorption profile over 5.5 scale
heights with model spectral absorption profiles and constrain the temperature
at different atmospheric regions, allowing us to construct a vertical
temperature profile. We identify two temperature regimes; a 1280 +/- 240 K
region derived from the NaI doublet line wings corresponding to altitudes below
~ 500 km, and a 2800 +/- 400 K region derived from the NaI doublet line cores
corresponding to altitudes from ~ 500-4000 km. The zero altitude is defined by
the white-light radius of Rp/Rstar=0.15628 +/- 0.00009. The temperature rises
with altitude, which is likely evidence of a thermosphere. The absolute
pressure scale depends on the species responsible for the Rayleigh signature
and its abundance. We discuss a plausible scenario for this species, a
high-altitude silicate haze, and the atmospheric temperature-pressure profile
that results. In this case, the high altitude temperature rise for HD 189733b
occurs at pressures of 10^-5 to 10^-8 bar.

signaling in response to antigen increases with affinity, a process known as

cell surface dynamics and signaling to show that affinity discrimination can
arise from the formation of BCR oligomers. It is known that BCRs form oligomers
upon encountering antigen, and that the size and rate of formation of these
oligomers increase with affinity. In our simulation, we have introduced a
requirement that only BCR-antigen complexes that are part of an oligomer can
engage cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as Src-family kinases. Our
simulation shows that as affinity increases, not only does the number of
collected antigen increases, but so does signaling activity. Our results are
also consistent with the existence of an experimentally-observed threshold
affinity of activation (no signaling activity below this affinity value) and
affinity discrimination ceiling (no affinity discrimination above this affinity
value). Comparison with experiments shows that the time scale of dimer
formation predicted by our model (less than 10 s) is well within the time scale
of experimentally observed association of BCR with Src-family kinases (10-20
s).

that the character of the flow where one evaluates the gas properties is

hot virialised gas with zero angular momentum and negligible radiative cooling
is the Bondi-Hoyle solution relevant. In the opposite extreme, where the gas is
in a state of free-fall at the evaluation radius due to efficient cooling and
the dominant gravity of the surrounding halo, the Bondi-Hoyle formalism can be
erroneous by orders of magnitude in either direction. This may impose
artificial trends with halo mass in cosmological simulations by being wrong by
different factors for different halo masses. We propose an expression for the
sub-grid accretion rate which interpolates between the free-fall regime and the
Bondi-Hoyle regime, therefore taking account of the contribution of the halo to

greater than in the $[110]$ directions. The Bain transformation, which is a

Binaries (HMXBs) and so we have investigated the possibility of an HMXB
population in Phoenix with the intention of furthering the understanding of the
HMXB-star formation rate relation. The data from the combined European Photon
Imaging Cameras (EPIC) were used to distinguish between different source
classes (foreground stars, background galaxies, AGN and supernova remnants)
using EPIC hardness ratios and correlations with optical and radio catalogues.
Of the 81 X-ray sources in the field of view, six are foreground stars, four
are galaxies and one is an AGN. The remaining sources with optical counterparts
have log($\frac{f_X}{f_{opt}}$) consistent with AGN in the local universe.
Further investigation of five sources in the field of view suggests they are
all background AGN. Their position behind the gas cloud associated with Phoenix
makes them a possible tool for further probing the metallicity of this region.
We find no evidence for any HMXBs in Phoenix at this time. This rules out the
existence of the X-ray persistent supergiant X-ray binary systems. However the
transient nature of the Be/X-ray binaries means we cannot rule out a population
of these sources but can conclude that it is not extensive.

microscopic and phenomenological approaches of the nuclear equation of state.
The microscopic ones include the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approximation, the
well known variational equation of state of Akmal, Pandharipande and Ravenhall,
and a parametrization of recent Auxiliary Field Diffusion Monte Carlo
calculations. For the phenomenological approaches, we use several Skyrme forces
and relativisic mean field models. Our results show that the {\it r}-mode
instability region is smaller for those models which give larger values of $L$.
The reason is that both bulk ($\xi$) and shear ($\eta$) viscosities increase
with $L$ and, therefore, the damping of the mode is more efficient for the
models with larger $L$. We show also that the dependence of both viscosities on
$L$ can be described at each density by simple power-laws of the type
$\xi=A_{\xi}L^{B_\xi}$ and $\eta=A_{\eta}L^{B_\eta}$. Using the measured spin
frequency and the estimated core temperature of the pulsar in the low-mass
X-ray binary 4U 1608-52, we conclude that observational data seem to favor
values of $L$ larger than $\sim 50$ MeV if this object is assumed to be outside
the instability region, its radius is in the range $11.5-12$($11.5-13$) km, and

also be optimal in certain special cases. This paper is dedicated to high-SNR
analysis of MIMO linear precoding. The Diversity-Multiplexing Tradeoff (DMT) of
a number of linear precoders is analyzed. Furthermore, since the diversity at
finite rate (also known as the fixed-rate regime, corresponding to multiplexing
gain of zero) does not always follow from the DMT, linear precoders are also
analyzed for their diversity at fixed rates. In several cases, the diversity at
multiplexing gain of zero is found not to be unique, but rather to depend on
spectral efficiency. The analysis includes the zero-forcing (ZF), regularized
ZF, matched filtering and Wiener filtering precoders. We calculate the DMT of
ZF precoding under two common design approaches, namely maximizing the
throughput and minimizing the transmit power. It is shown that regularized ZF
(RZF) or Matched filter (MF) suffer from error floors for all positive
multiplexing gains. However, in the fixed rate regime, RZF and MF precoding
achieve full diversity up to a certain spectral efficiency and zero diversity
at rates above it. When the regularization parameter in the RZF is optimized in
the MMSE sense, the structure is known as the Wiener precoder which in the
fixed-rate regime is shown to have diversity that depends not only on the
number of antennas, but also on the spectral efficiency. The diversity in the
presence of both precoding and equalization is also analyzed.

(individually stigmatizing) statistic on a population. In our model,
individuals are concerned about their privacy, and experience some cost as a
function of their privacy loss. Nevertheless, they would be willing to

These cost functions are not publicly known, however, nor do we make Bayesian

misreport their costs for privacy if doing so is in their best interest. Ghosh
and Roth recently showed in this setting, when costs for privacy loss may be
correlated with private types, if individuals value differential privacy, no
individually rational direct revelation mechanism can compute any non-trivial
estimate of the population statistic. In this paper, we circumvent this
impossibility result by proposing a modified notion of how individuals
experience cost as a function of their privacy loss, and by giving a mechanism
which does not operate by direct revelation. Instead, our mechanism has the
ability to randomly approach individuals from a population and offer them a
take-it-or-leave-it offer. This is intended to model the abilities of a
surveyor who may stand on a street corner and approach passers-by.

The number of photons can be chosen, as it is determined by the Zeeman

deterministic generation of a free-propagating Fock state of $1\leq n\leq2F$
photons is achieved, when a circularly polarized laser pulse completely

different numbers of photons by using different transitions of the same atom.
We show also that this technique provides a deterministic source of a train of

field theory (EFT) which takes the form of a multipole expansion. Its action is
given by a derivative expansion where higher order terms are suppressed by
powers of the ratio of the size of the source over the wavelength. In order to
determine the Wilson coefficients of the EFT, i.e. the multipole moments, one
needs the mapping between a linear source term action and the multipole
expansion form of the action of the EFT. In this paper we perform the multipole
expansion to all orders by Taylor expanding the field in the source term and
then decomposing the action into symmetric trace free tensors which form
irreducible representations of the rotation group. We work at the level of the
action, and we obtain the action to all orders in the multipole expansion and
the exact expressions for the multipole moments for a scalar field,
electromagnetism and linearized gravity. Our results for the latter two cases
are manifestly gauge invariant. We also give expressions for the energy flux

the theorem such that the wavelet correlation spectrum between long memory

the two phenomena share the inherent complexity of particle trajectories, the
scale free spatial patterns and the power law statistics of fluctuations. The
origin of the apparently chaotic and at the same time highly correlated
microscopic response in plasticity remains hidden behind conventional
engineering models which are based on smooth fitting functions. To regain
access to fluctuations, we study in this paper a minimal mesoscopic model whose
goal is to elucidate the origin of scale free behavior in plasticity. We limit
our description to fcc type crystals and leave out both temperature and rate
effects. We provide simple illustrations of the fact that complexity in rate
independent athermal plastic flows is due to marginal stability of the
underlying elastic system. Our conclusions are based on a reduction of an
over-damped visco-elasticity problem for a system with a rugged elastic energy
landscape to an integer valued automaton. We start with an overdamped one
dimensional model and show that it reproduces the main macroscopic
phenomenology of rate independent plastic behavior but falls short of
generating self similar structure of fluctuations. We then provide evidence
that a two dimensional model is already adequate for describing power law
statistics of avalanches and fractal character of dislocation patterning. In
addition to capturing experimentally measured critical exponents, the proposed
minimal model shows finite size scaling collapse and generates realistic shape
functions in the scaling laws.

the IMF is required to become more top-heavy the lower the cluster metallicity
and the larger the pre-GC cloud-core density are. The deduced trends are in
qualitative agreement with theoretical expectation. The results are consistent
with estimates of the shape of the high-mass end of the IMF in the Arches

constrained for ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs). The latter suggests that
GCs and UCDs might have formed along the same channel or that UCDs formed via

(141 absorbers) provided evidence for a smaller alpha in the distant absorption
clouds. Upon combining the samples an apparent variation of alpha across the
sky emerges which is well represented by an angular dipole model pointing in
the direction RA=(17.3 +/- 1.0) hr, dec. = (-61 +/- 10) deg, with amplitude
(0.97 +0.22/-0.20) x 10^(-5). The dipole model is required at the 4.1 sigma
statistical significance level over a simple monopole model where alpha is the
same across the sky (but possibly different to the current laboratory value).
The data sets reveal a number of remarkable consistencies: various data cuts
are consistent and there is consistency in the overlap region of the Keck and
VLT samples. Assuming a dipole-only (i.e. no-monopole) model whose amplitude
grows proportionally with `lookback-time distance' (r=ct, where t is the
lookback time), the amplitude is (1.1 +/- 0.2) x 10^(-6) GLyr^(-1) and the
model is significant at the 4.2 sigma confidence level over the null model
[Delta alpha]/alpha = 0). We apply robustness checks and demonstrate that the
dipole effect does not originate from a small subset of the absorbers or
spectra. We present an analysis of systematic effects, and are unable to
identify any single systematic effect which can emulate the observed variation
in alpha.

concomitant Fermi surface reconstruction, has recently been shown to be
strongly coupled in two spatial dimensions. The onset of unconventional
superconductivity near this critical point is reviewed: it involves a subtle
interplay between the breakdown of fermionic quasiparticle excitations on the
Fermi surface, and the strong pairing glue provided by the antiferromagnetic
fluctuations. The net result is a logarithm-squared enhancement of the pairing
vertex for generic Fermi surfaces, with a universal dimensionless co-efficient
independent of the strength of interactions, which is expected to lead to
superconductivity at the scale of the Fermi energy. We also discuss the
possibility that the antiferromagnetic critical point can be replaced by an
intermediate `fractionalized Fermi liquid' phase, in which there is Fermi
surface reconstruction but no long-range antiferromagnetic order. We discuss
the relevance of this phase to the underdoped cuprates and the heavy-fermion

three environmental: galaxy stellar mass (M_*), total group stellar
mass(M_{*,grp}, a proxy for group halo mass), normalized group-centric radius
(r_grp), and local galaxy density (Sigma_5). We find that M_* is the dominant
parameter such that there is a strong correlation between f_red and galaxy
stellar mass. Furthermore, the dependence of f_red on the environmental
parameters is also a strong function of M_*. Massive galaxies (M_* > 10^11
M_sun) show little dependence of f_red on r_grp, M_{*,grp}, and Sigma_5 over
the redshift range. The dependence of f_red on these parameters is primarily
seen for galaxies with lower masses, especially for M_* < 10^{10.6} M_{sun}. We
observe an apparent `group down-sizing' effect, in that galaxies in lower-mass
halos, after controlling for galaxy stellar mass, have lower f_red. We find a
dependence of \fred on both \rgrp and \SigmaF after the other parameters are

local Fundamental Metallicity Relation (FMR), taking into account the physical
processes of star formation, inflow of metal-poor intergalactic medium (IGM)
gas, and the outflow of metal rich interstellar medium (ISM) gas. We show that
the physics of the FMR can be summarised as follows: for massive galaxies with
stellar mass M_* >= 10^11 solar masses, ISM metal enrichment due to star
formation is compensated by inflow of metal poor IGM gas, leading to a constant
value of the gas metallicity with star formation rate (SFR); outflows are
rendered negligible as a result of the large potential wells of these galaxies.
On the other hand, as a result of their smaller SFR, less massive galaxies
produce less heavy elements that are also more efficiently ejected due to their
shallow potential wells; as a result, for a given M_*, the gas metallicity
decreases with SFR. For such galaxies, the outflow efficiency determines both
the slope, and the knee of the metallicity-SFR relation. Without changing any
parameters, this simple model is also successfully matched to the gas fraction
- gas metallicity relation observed for a sample of about 260 nearby galaxies.

In the weak field approximation, the conformal variations of the internal space
volume generate the admixture of the Yukawa potential to the usual Newton's
gravitational potential. For sufficiently large Yukawa masses, such admixture
is negligible and the metric coefficients of the external spacetime coincide
with the corresponding expressions of General Relativity. Then, these models
satisfy the classical gravitational tests. However, we show that gravitating
masses acquire effective relativistic pressure in the external space. Such
pressure contradicts the observations of compact astrophysical objects (e.g.,
the Sun). The equality $\Omega =-1/2$ (i.e. tension) is the only possibility to
preserve the dustlike equation of state in the external space. Therefore, in

density-functional theory (TDDFT). Evidence has been given in the literature
that TDDFT can produce bound as well as continuum excitons for specific
systems, but there are still many unresolved basic questions concerning the
role of dynamical exchange and correlation (xc). In particular, the role of the
long spatial range and the frequency dependence of the xc kernel $f_{\rm xc}$
for excitonic binding are still not very well explored. We present a minimal
model for excitons in TDDFT, consisting of two bands from a one-dimensional
Kronig-Penney model and simple approximate xc kernels, which allows us to
address these questions in a transparent manner. Depending on the system, it is
found that adiabatic xc kernels can produce a single bound exciton, and
sometimes two bound excitons, where the long spatial range of $f_{\rm xc}$ is
not a necessary condition. It is shown how the Wannier model, featuring an
effective electron-hole interaction, emerges from TDDFT. The collective,
many-body nature of excitons is explicitly demonstrated.

states, so called doublons. Such states may be created by dynamically tuning
the interaction strength, e.g. using a Feshbach resonance, from attraction to
repulsion. We study the doublon production efficiency as a function of the
tuning rate at which the on-site interaction is varied. An expectation based on
the Landau- Zener law suggests that exponentially few doublons are created in
the adiabatic limit. Contrary to such an expectation, we found that the number
of produced doublons scales as a power law of the tuning rate with the exponent
dependent on the dimensionality of the lattice. The physical reason for this
anomaly is the effective decoupling of doublons from the two-particle continuum
for center of mass momenta close to the corners of the Brillouin zone. The
study of doublon production may be a sensitive tool to extract detailed

populations, we constrain the contribution of thermally-pulsing asymptotic

near-infrared (NIR) luminosities of 23 nearby galaxies. The TP-AGB phase
contributes as much as 17% of the integrated F160W flux, even when the red
giant branch is well populated. The RHeB population contribution can match or
even exceed the TP-AGB contribution, providing as much as 21% of the integrated
F160W light. The NIR mass-to-light (M/L) ratio should therefore be expected to
vary significantly due to fluctuations in the star formation rate over
timescales from 25 Myr to several Gyr. We compare our observational results to
predictions based on optically derived star formation histories and stellar
population synthesis (SPS) models, including models based on the Padova
isochrones (used in popular SPS programs). The SPS models generally reproduce
the expected numbers of TP-AGB stars in the sample. The same SPS models,
however, give a larger discrepancy in the F160W flux contribution from the
TP-AGB stars, over-predicting the flux by a weighted mean factor of 2.3 +/-0.8.
This larger offset is driven by the prediction of modest numbers of high
luminosity TP-AGB stars at young (<300 Myrs) ages. The best-fit SPS models
simultaneously tend to under-predict the numbers and fluxes of stars on the
RHeB sequence, typically by a factor of 2.0+/-0.6 for galaxies with significant
numbers of RHeBs. Coincidentally, over-prediction of the TP-AGB and
under-prediction of the RHeBs result in a NIR M/L ratio largely unchanged for a
rapid star formation rate. However, the NIR-to-optical flux ratio of galaxies
could be significantly smaller than AGB-rich models would predict, an outcome
that has been observed in some intermediate redshift post-starburst galaxies.

of astrophysics. For the correct modeling of the resonance lines, which are
among the key diagnostics of stellar mass-loss, the stellar wind clumping
turned out to be very important. In order to incorporate clumping into
radiative transfer calculation, 3-D models are required. Various properties of
the clumps may have strong impact on the resonance line formation and,
therefore, on the determination of empirical mass-loss rates. We incorporate
the 3-D nature of the stellar wind clumping into radiative transfer
calculations and investigate how different model parameters influence the
resonance line formation. We develop a full 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer
code for inhomogeneous expanding stellar winds. The number density of clumps
follows the mass conservation. For the first time, realistic 3-D models that
describe the dense as well as the tenuous wind components are used to model the
formation of resonance lines in a clumped stellar wind. At the same time,
non-monotonic velocity fields are accounted for. The 3-D density and velocity
wind inhomogeneities show very strong impact on the resonance line formation.
The different parameters describing the clumping and the velocity field results
in different line strengths and profiles. We present a set of representative
models for various sets of model parameters and investigate how the resonance
lines are affected. Our 3-D models show that the line opacity is reduced for
larger clump separation and for more shallow velocity gradients within the
clumps. Our new model demonstrates that to obtain empirically correct mass-loss
rates from the UV resonance lines, the wind clumping and its 3-D nature must be
taken into account.

range v_lsr = -6 to -1 km/s (-3 km/s clouds), our observations reveal two new
ambient molecular cloud components: small (~ 1') bright clouds in v_lsr = -8 to
-3 km/s (SCs), and diffuse clouds in v_lsr = +3 to +10 km/s (+5 km/s clouds).
Our data also reveal the detailed kinematics of the shocked molecular gas in
IC443, however the focus of this paper is the physical relationship between the
shocked clumps and the ambient cloud components. We find strong evidence that
the SCs are associated with the shocked clumps. This is supported by the
positional coincidence of the SCs with shocked clumps and other tracers of
shocks. Furthermore, the kinematic features of some shocked clumps suggest that
these are the ablated material from the SCs upon the impact of the SNR shock.
The SCs are interpreted as dense cores of parental molecular clouds that
survived the destruction by the pre-supernova evolution of the progenitor star
or its nearby stars. We propose that the expanding SNR shock is now impacting
some of the remaining cores and the gas is being ablated and accelerated
producing the shocked molecular gas. The morphology of the +5 km/s clouds
suggests an association with IC443. On the other hand, the -3 km/s clouds show
no evidence for interaction.

Both the HI morphology and kinematics are suggestive of tidal interactions. In
NGC 7332, we do not find any directly-associated HI. Instead, NGC 7339, a
neighbour of a comparable size at about 10 kpc, is found with 8.9e8 Msun of HI
gas. More recently in a single dish observation, however, another group
discovered a large HI structure which seems to be an extension of NGC 7339's HI
disc and also covers NGC 7332. All these observations thus suggest that HI gas
is being accreted in these three galaxies from their companions, which is
likely responsible for the kinematically-decoupled gas component present in
their central region. Considering the incompleteness of existing studies of the
faint dwarf galaxy population both in the optical and in HI, accretion from

these data can be quantitatively fit to a 'skin effect' model that accounts for
the increased exposure of molecules near the top of irradiated gel slices. The
results indicate that 200-nucleotide RNAs subjected to 20 seconds or less of UV
shadowing can incur damage to 20% of molecules, and the molecule-by-molecule

which undergo chi-squared cutoff but in which total variation mixing occurs
substantially earlier and without cutoff is produced. These results resolve a

  Probabilistic Min(Max) Polynomial Bellman Equations",,,,,"cs.CC cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We show that one can approximate the least fixed point solution for a
multivariate system of monotone probabilistic max(min) polynomial equations,
referred to as maxPPSs (and minPPSs, respectively), in time polynomial in both
the encoding size of the system of equations and in log(1/epsilon), where
epsilon > 0 is the desired additive error bound of the solution. (The model of
computation is the standard Turing machine model.) We establish this result
using a generalization of Newton's method which applies to maxPPSs and minPPSs,
even though the underlying functions are only piecewise-differentiable. This
generalizes our recent work which provided a P-time algorithm for purely
probabilistic PPSs.
  These equations form the Bellman optimality equations for several important
classes of infinite-state Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Thus, as a
corollary, we obtain the first polynomial time algorithms for computing to
within arbitrary desired precision the optimal value vector for several classes
of infinite-state MDPs which arise as extensions of classic, and heavily
studied, purely stochastic processes. These include both the problem of
maximizing and mininizing the termination (extinction) probability of
multi-type branching MDPs, stochastic context-free MDPs, and 1-exit Recursive
MDPs.
  Furthermore, we also show that we can compute in P-time an epsilon-optimal
policy for both maximizing and minimizing branching, context-free, and
1-exit-Recursive MDPs, for any given desired epsilon > 0. This is despite the
fact that actually computing optimal strategies is Sqrt-Sum-hard and
PosSLP-hard in this setting.
  We also derive, as an easy consequence of these results, an FNP upper bound
on the complexity of computing the value (within arbitrary desired precision)
of branching simple stochastic games (BSSGs).

implementation is performed using a fully-correlated, Breit-Pauli R-matrix

resonances gives rise to a resonant photoionization cross section that is
significantly lower than the total photoabsorption cross section. Furthermore,
the radiation-damped photoionization cross section is found to be in good
agreement with recent experimental results once a global shift in energy of
$\approx -3.5$ eV is applied. These findings have important implications.
Firstly, the presently available synchrotron experimental data are applicable
only to photoionization processes and not to photoabsorption; the latter is
required in opacity calculations. Secondly, our computed cross section, for
which the L-shell ionization threshold is aligned with the NIST value, shows a
series of $2p \rightarrow nd$ Rydberg resonances that are uniformly 3-4 eV
higher in energy than the corresponding experimental profiles, indicating that
the L-shell threshold energy values currently recommended by NIST are likely in
error.

based on the Thomas-Fermi approximation, is introduced for the wavefunction. We
show that g_max becomes a function of R_0 sqrt(V_0) for various one-, two-, and
three-dimensional defect shapes with depths V_0 and characteristic lengths R_0.
Our explicit calculations show surprising agreement with this crude model over
a wide range of V_0 and R_0. A scaling rule is also found for the wavefunction
for the ground state at the threshold at which the localized states approach
delocalization. The implication is that two defects with the same product R_0
sqrt(V_0) will thus be related to each other with the same g_max and will have
the same (reduced) density profile in the free-direction/s.

(FG) candidates identified in our previous work using SDSS and RASS data. Four
candidates (out of six) exhibit extended X-ray emission, confirming them as
true FGs. For the other two groups, the RASS emission has its origin as either
an optically dull/X-ray bright AGN, or the blending of distinct X-ray sources.
Using SDSS-DR7 data, we confirm, for all groups, the presence of an r-band
magnitude gap between the seed elliptical and the second-rank galaxy. However,
the gap value depends, up to 0.5mag, on how one estimates the seed galaxy total
flux, which is greatly underestimated when using SDSS (relative to Sersic)
magnitudes. This implies that many FGs may be actually missed when using SDSS
data, a fact that should be carefully taken into account when comparing the
observed number densities of FGs to the expectations from cosmological
simulations. The similarity in the properties of seed--FG and non-fossil
ellipticals, found in our previous study, extends to the sample of X-ray
confirmed FGs, indicating that bright ellipticals in FGs do not represent a
distinct population of galaxies. For one system, we also find that the velocity
distribution of faint galaxies is bimodal, possibly showing that the system
formed through the merging of two groups. This undermines the idea that all
selected FGs form a population of true fossils.

network generation - that is, how can we create synthetic networks that match
characteristics traditionally found in most real world networks? Important
characteristics that are present in social networks include a power law degree
distribution, small diameter and large amounts of clustering; however, most
current network generators, such as the Chung Lu and Kronecker models, largely
ignore the clustering present in a graph and choose to focus on preserving
other network statistics, such as the power law distribution. Models such as
the exponential random graph model have a transitivity parameter, but are
computationally difficult to learn, making scaling to large real world networks
intractable. In this work, we propose an extension to the Chung Lu ran- dom
graph model, the Transitive Chung Lu (TCL) model, which incorporates the notion
of a random transitive edge. That is, with some probability it will choose to
connect to a node exactly two hops away, having been introduced to a 'friend of
a friend'. In all other cases it will follow the standard Chung Lu model,
selecting a 'random surfer' from anywhere in the graph according to the given
invariant distribution. We prove TCL's expected degree distribution is equal to
the degree distribution of the original graph, while being able to capture the
clustering present in the network. The single parameter required by our model
can be learned in seconds on graphs with millions of edges, while networks can
be generated in time that is linear in the number of edges. We demonstrate the
performance TCL on four real- world social networks, including an email dataset
with hundreds of thousands of nodes and millions of edges, showing TCL
generates graphs that match the degree distribution, clustering coefficients
and hop plots of the original networks.

falsify any assumed cosmological model without putting priors on the underlying
actual model of the universe and its parameters, hence the issue of dark energy
parametrization is resolved. It will be also shown that the sensitivity of the

important characteristic of the method in testing cosmological models dealing

observations of the semi-detached binary system SZ Herculis and proposed the
existence of two hierarchical cirumbinary companions. Based on the light-travel
time effect, the two low-mass M-dwarf companions are found to orbit the binary
pair on moderate to high eccentric orbits. The derived periods of these two
companions are close to a 2:1 mean-motion orbital resonance. We have studied
the stability of the system using the osculating orbital elements as presented
by Lee et al. Results indicate an orbit-crossing architecture exhibiting
short-term dynamical instabilities leading to the escape of one of the proposed
companions. We have examined the system's underlying model parameter-space by
following a Monte Carlo approach and found an improved fit to the timing data.
A study of the stability of our best-fitting orbits also indicates that the
proposed system is generally unstable. If the observed anomalous timing
variations of the binary period is due to additional circumbinary companions,
then the resulting system should exhibit a long-term stable orbital
configuration much different from the orbits suggested by Lee et al. We,
therefore, suggest that based on Newtonian-dynamical considerations, the
proposed quadruple system cannot exist. To uncover the true nature of the
observed period variations of this system, we recommend future photometric
follow-up observations that could further constrain eclipse-timing variations
and/or refine light-travel time models.

charge transport properties of the metallic phase of the overdoped cuprate
superconductors. The self-energy is the sum of two terms with characteristic
dependencies on temperature, frequency, location on the Fermi surface, and
doping. The first term is isotropic over the Fermi surface, independent of
doping, and has the frequency and temperature dependence characteristic of a
Fermi liquid. The second term is anisotropic over the Fermi surface (vanishing
at the same points as the superconducting energy gap), strongly varies with
doping (scaling roughly with $T_c$, the superconducting transition
temperature), and has the frequency and temperature dependence characteristic
of a marginal Fermi liquid. Previously it has been shown this self-energy can
describe a range of experimental data including angle-dependent
magnetoresistance (ADMR) and quasi-particle renormalisations determined from
specific heat, quantum oscillations, and angle-resolved photo-emission
spectroscopy (ARPES). Without introducing new parameters and neglecting vertex
corrections we show that this model self-energy can give a quantitative
description of the temperature and doping dependence of a range of reported
transport properties of Tl2201 samples. These include the intra-layer
resistivity, the frequency dependent optical conductivity, the intra-layer
magnetoresistance, and the Hall coefficient. The temperature dependence of the
latter two are particularly sensitive to the anisotropy of the scattering rate
and to the shape of the Fermi surface. In contrast, the temperature dependence
of the Hall angle is dominated by the Fermi liquid contribution to the
self-energy that determines the scattering rate in the nodal regions of the
Fermi surface.

equations may then be obtained in an exact parametric form in terms of the
parameter representing the conformal factor. This provides the possibility of
studying the behavior of the angular velocity of a test particle moving in a

Elevation of seismic stations in the US is strongly anti-correlated with

theorem prover PVS and the SMT solver Yices to discharge as many of the
verification conditions as possible without user interaction. In this paper, we
first describe the Socos environment from a user and systems level perspective;
we then exemplify the IBP workflow by building a verified implementation of
heapsort in Socos. The case study highlights the role of both automatic and
interactive theorem proving in three sequential stages of the IBP workflow:
developing the background theory, formulating the program specification and
invariants, and proving the correctness of the final implementation.

""Lucas Interpretation"". This has been implemented in a prototype, which has
been proved useful in educational practice and has gained academic relevance
with an emerging generation of educational mathematics assistants (EMA) based
on Computer Theorem Proving (CTP).
  Automated Theorem Proving (ATP), i.e. deduction, is the most reliable
technology used to check user input. However ATP is inherently weak in
automatically generating solutions for arbitrary problems in applied
mathematics. This weakness is crucial for EMAs: when ATP checks user input as
incorrect and the learner gets stuck then the system should be able to suggest
possible next steps.
  The key idea of Lucas Interpretation is to compute the steps of a calculation
following a program written in a novel CTP-based programming language, i.e.
computation provides the next steps. User guidance is generated by combining
deduction and computation: the latter is performed by a specific language
interpreter, which works like a debugger and hands over control to the learner
at breakpoints, i.e. tactics generating the steps of calculation. The
interpreter also builds up logical contexts providing ATP with the data
required for checking user input, thus combining computation and deduction.
  The paper describes the concepts underlying Lucas Interpretation so that open
questions can adequately be addressed, and prerequisites for further work are
provided.

fixed prior to actually performing the formal verification. More concretely,

the variations of $n_{ch}$ in nucleus-nucleus collisions with respect to the

propose a phenomenological model based on the constituent quark-quark

pseudorapidity density at mid-rapidity ($(dn_{ch}/d\eta)_{\eta=0}$) of charged
hadrons at various center-of-mass energies $(\sqrt{s_{NN}})$ for

$n_{ch}^{pp}$ and $(dn_{ch}/d\eta)^{pp}_{\eta=0}$ in $p-p$ interactions based
on some initial inputs which fit the experimental data very well. We further
extend this parametrization by using simple phenomenological assumptions
regarding mean number of participating quarks and mean number of collisions to
obtain the $n_{ch}$ and $(dn_{ch}/d\eta)_{\eta=0}$ for $A-A$ collisions and
show their dependencies on the mass number of colliding nuclei as well as on
$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. We also compare the results obtained from our model with the

difference between the two formalisms. Finally, we compare the charged hadron

observations of the peculiar Type IIn supernova (SN) 2011ht in UGC 5460. The UV
observations of the rise to peak are only the second ever recorded for a Type
IIn SN and are by far the most complete. The SN, first classified as a SN
impostor, slowly rose to a peak of M_V \sim -17 in \sim55 days. In contrast to
the \sim2 magnitude increase in the v-band light curve from the first
observation until peak, the UV flux increased by >7 magnitudes. The optical
spectra are dominated by strong, Balmer emission with narrow peaks (FWHM\sim600
km/s), very broad asymmetric wings (FWHM\sim4200 km/s), and blue shifted
absorption (\sim300 km/s) superposed on a strong blue continuum. The UV spectra
are dominated by FeII, MgII, SiII, and SiIII absorption lines broadened by
\sim1500 km/s. Merged X-ray observations reveal a
L_(0.2-10)=(1.0+/-0.2)x10^(39) erg/s. Some properties of SN 2011ht are similar
to SN impostors, while others are comparable to Type IIn SNe. Early spectra
showed features typical of luminous blue variables at maximum and during giant
eruptions. However, the broad emission profiles coupled with the strong UV flux
have not been observed in previous SN impostors. The absolute magnitude and
energetics (~2.5x10^(49) ergs in the first 112 days) are reminiscent of normal
Type IIn SN, but the spectra are of a dense wind. We suggest that the mechanism
for creating this unusual profile could be a shock interacting with a shell of
material that was ejected a year before the discovery of the SN.

which the dependent variable is scalar while the covariate is a function, and
the conditional quantile for each fixed quantile index is modeled as a linear
functional of the covariate. Here we suppose that covariates are discretely
observed and sampling points may differ across subjects, where the number of
measurements per subject increases as the sample size. Also, we allow the
quantile index to vary over a given subset of the open unit interval, so the
slope function is a function of two variables: (typically) time and quantile
index. Likewise, the conditional quantile function is a function of the
quantile index and the covariate. We consider an estimator for the slope
function based on the principal component basis. An estimator for the
conditional quantile function is obtained by a plug-in method. Since the
so-constructed plug-in estimator not necessarily satisfies the monotonicity
constraint with respect to the quantile index, we also consider a class of
monotonized estimators for the conditional quantile function. We establish
rates of convergence for these estimators under suitable norms, showing that
these rates are optimal in a minimax sense under some smoothness assumptions on
the covariance kernel of the covariate and the slope function. Empirical choice
of the cutoff level is studied by using simulations.

standard photometry was obtained with the Stromgren Automatic Telescope. The
broadening function formalism was applied on spectra observed with HERMES at
the Mercator telescope in La Palma, to obtain radial velocity curves. Masses
and radii with a precision of 0.6% and 1.0% respectively have been established
for both components of EF Aqr. The active 0.956 M_sol secondary shows star
spots and strong Ca II H and K emission lines. The 1.224 M_sol primary shows
signs of activity as well, but at a lower level. An [Fe/H] abundance of
0.00+-0.10 is derived with similar abundances for Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co,
and Ni. Solar calibrated evolutionary models such as Yonsei-Yale,
Victoria-Regina and BaSTI isochrones and evolutionary tracks are unable to
reproduce EF Aqr, especially for the secondary, which is 9% larger and 400 K
cooler than predicted. Models adopting significantly lower mixing length
parameters l/H_p remove these discrepancies, as seen in other solar type
binaries. For the observed metallicity, Granada models with a mixing length of
l/H_p=1.30 (primary) and 1.05 (secondary) reproduce both components at a common
age of 1.5+-0.6 Gyr. Observations of EF Aqr suggests that magnetic activity,
and its effect on envelope convection, is likely to be the cause of
discrepancies in both radius and temperature, which can be removed by adjusting
the mixing length parameter of the models downwards.

diagonalization (BD) is a practical linear precoding scheme which achieves the

regime due to the transmit power boost problem. In this paper, we propose an
improved linear precoding scheme over BD with a so-called
""effective-SNR-enhancement"" technique. The transmit covariance matrices are
obtained by firstly solving a power minimization problem subject to the minimum
rate constraint achieved by BD, and then properly scaling the solution to
satisfy the power constraints. It is proved that such approach equivalently
enhances the system SNR, and hence compensates the transmit power boost problem
associated with BD. The power minimization problem is in general non-convex. We
therefore propose an efficient algorithm that solves the problem heuristically.
Simulation results show significant sum rate gains over the optimal BD and the
existing minimum mean square error (MMSE) based precoding schemes.

the situation that a charged particle plunges from the innermost stable
circular orbit (ISCO) and collides with another particle near the horizon.
Recently, Frolov [Phys. Rev. D 85, 024020 (2012)] proposed that the CM energy
can be arbitrarily high if the magnetic field is arbitrarily strong, when a
particle collides with a charged particle orbiting the ISCO with finite energy
near the horizon of a uniformly magnetized Schwarzschild black hole. We show
that the charged particle orbiting the ISCO around a spinning black hole needs
arbitrarily high energy in the strong field limit. This suggests that Frolov's
process is unstable against the black hole spin. Nevertheless, we see that
magnetic fields may substantially promote the capability of rotating black
holes as particle accelerators in astrophysical situations.

typically operate in unlicensed frequency bands that are subject to external
interference from devices transmitting at much higher power. Communication
protocols should therefore be designed to be robust against such interference.
A critical building block of many protocols at all layers is agreement on a
piece of information among a set of nodes. At the MAC layer, nodes may need to
agree on a new time slot or frequency channel; at the application layer nodes
may need to agree on handing over a leader role from one node to another.
Message loss caused by interference may break agreement in two different ways:
none of the nodes use the new information (time slot, channel, leader) and
stick with the previous assignment, or - even worse - some nodes use the new
information and some do not. This may lead to reduced performance or failures.
In this paper we investigate the problem of agreement under interference and
point out the limitations of the traditional message-based n-way handshake
approach. We propose novel protocols that use jamming instead of message
transmissions and show that they outperform the n-way handshake in terms of
agreement probability, energy consumption, and time-to-completion both in the
unicast case (two neighboring nodes agree) as well as in the broadcast case
(any number of neighboring nodes agree).

large filament first rose slowly at a speed of 8 km/s for 23 minutes and then
it was accelerated to 102 km/s. Finally, this filament erupted successfully and
caused a coronal mass ejection. During the slow rising phase, various evidence
for breakout-like external reconnection has been identified at high and low
temperature lines. The eruption of the small filament started around the end of
the large filament's slow rising. This filament erupted partially and no
associating coronal mass ejection could be detected. Based on a potential field
extrapolation, we find that the topology of the three-dimensional coronal field
above the source region is composed of three low-lying lobes and a large
overlying flux system, and a null point located between the middle lobe and the
overlying antiparallel flux system. We propose a possible mechanism within the
framework of the magnetic breakout model to interpret the sympathetic filament
eruptions, in which the magnetic implosion mechanism is thought to be a
possible linkage between the sympathetic eruptions, and the external
reconnection at the null point transfers field lines from the middle lobe to
the lateral lobes and thereby leads to the full (partial) eruption of the
observed large (small) filament. Other possible mechanisms are also discussed
briefly. We conclude that the structural properties of coronal fields are
important for producing sympathetic eruptions.

proteomic separation techniques. However, controlling technological variability

is mandatory for data analysis to take into account the complexity of the
analysed mixture, to improve the measurement reliability and to make the
technology user friendly. Therefore we develop a hierarchical parametric
probabilistic model of the LC-MS analytical chain including the technological
variability. We introduce a Bayesian reconstruction methodology to recover the
protein biomarkers content in a robust way. We will focus on the digestion step
since it brings a major contribution to technological variability. Method : In
this communication, we introduce a hierarchical model of the LC-MS analytical
chain. Such a chain is a cascade of molecular events depicted by a graph
structure, each node being associated to a molecular state such as protein,
peptide and ion and each branch to a molecular processing such as digestion,
ionisation and LC-MS separation. This molecular graph defines a hierarchical
mixture model. We extend the Bayesian statistical framework we have introduced
previously [1] to this hierarchical description. As an example, we will
consider the digestion step. We describe the digestion process on a pair of
peptides within the targeted protein as a Bernoulli random process associated
with a cleavage probability controlled by the digestion kinetic law.

synthesis models, which are stellar evolution, stellar atmospheres, the IMF,

and IGM. The chapter focusses in particular on issues of importance for
predictions of metal-poor and Population III dominated galaxies.
  We review recent predictions for the main physical properties and related
observables of star-forming galaxies based on up-to-date inputs. The predicted
metallicity dependence of these quantities and their physical causes are
discussed. The predicted observables include in particular the restframe
UV-to-optical domain with continuum emission from stars and the ionized ISM, as
well as emission lines from H, He, and metals.
  Based on these predictions we summarize the main observational signatures
(emission line strengths, colors etc.), which can be used to distinguish
""normal"" stellar populations from very metal-poor objects or even Pop III.
  Evolutionary synthesis models provide an important and fundamental tool for
studies of galaxy formation and evolution, from the nearby Universe back to
first galaxies. They are used in many applications to interpret existing
observations, to predict and guide future missions/instruments, and to allow
direct comparisons between state-of-the-art galaxy simulations and

of caches that employ the Random replacement policy. Assuming that requests are
independent and identically distributed, general expressions of miss
probabilities for a single Random cache are provided as well as exact results
for specific popularity distributions. Moreover, for any Zipf popularity
distribution with exponent $\alpha$ > 1, we obtain asymptotic equivalents for
the miss probability in the case of large cache size. We extend the analysis to
networks of Random caches, when the topology is either a line or a homogeneous
tree. In that case, approximations for miss probabilities across the network
are derived by assuming that miss events at any node occur independently in
time; the obtained results are compared to the same network using the
Least-Recently-Used discipline, already addressed in the literature. We further
analyze the case of a mixed tandem cache network where the two nodes employ
either Random or Least-Recently-Used policies. In all scenarios, asymptotic
formulas and approximations are extensively compared to simulations and shown
to perform very well. Finally, our results enable us to propose recommendations

'hard lags', in that the variations at harder energies follow variations at
softer energies, with a time-lag \tau depending on frequency \nu approximately
as \tau \propto \nu^{-0.7}. Several models have so far been proposed to explain
this time delay, including fluctuations propagating through an accretion flow,
spectral variations during coronal flares, Comptonisation in the extended hot
corona or a jet, or time-delays due to large-scale reflection from the
accretion disc. In principle these models can be used to predict the shape of
the energy spectrum as well as the frequency-dependence of the time-lags,
through the construction of energy-dependent response functions which map the
emission as a function of time-delay in the system. Here we use this approach
to test a simple reflection model for the frequency-dependent lags seen in the
hard state of GX 339-4, by simultaneously fitting the model to the
frequency-dependent lags and energy spectrum measured by XMM-Newton in 2004 and
2009. Our model cannot simultaneously fit both the lag and spectral data, since
the relatively large lags require an extremely flared disc which subtends a
large solid angle to the continuum at large radii, in disagreement with the
observed Fe K\alpha emission. Therefore, we consider it more likely that the
lags > 2 keV are caused by propagation effects in the accretion flow, possibly
related to the accretion disc fluctuations which have been observed previously.

contemporary to the giant planets. The actual process producing the first
generation of asteroids is uncertain, strongly depending on the physical
characteristics of the Solar Nebula, and the different scenarios produce very
diverse initial size-frequency distributions. In this work we investigate the
implications of the formation of Jupiter, plausibly the first giant planet to
form, on the evolution of the primordial asteroid belt. The formation of
Jupiter triggered a short but intense period of primordial bombardment,
previously unaccounted for, which caused an early phase of enhanced collisional
evolution in the asteroid belt. Our results indicate that this Jovian Early
Bombardment caused the erosion or the disruption of bodies smaller than a
threshold size, which strongly depends on the size-frequency distribution of
the primordial planetesimals. If the asteroid belt was dominated by
planetesimals less than 100 km in diameter, the primordial bombardment would
have caused the erosion of bodies smaller than 200 km in diameter. If the
asteroid belt was instead dominated by larger planetesimals, the bombardment
would have resulted in the destruction of bodies as big as 500 km.

in the internal syntax understood by the kernel of the ITP. In particular, it
acts as a type inference algorithm when all the binders are untyped. The
proposed algorithm is bi-directional: given a term in external syntax and a
type expected for the term, it propagates as much typing information as
possible towards the leaves of the term. Traditional mono-directional
algorithms, instead, proceed in a bottom-up way by inferring the type of a
sub-term and comparing (unifying) it with the type expected by its context only
at the end. We propose some novel bi-directional rules for CIC that are
particularly effective. Among the benefits of bi-directionality we have better
error message reporting and better inference of dependent types. Moreover,
thanks to bi-directionality, the coercion system for sub-typing is more
effective and type inference generates simpler unification problems that are
more likely to be solved by the inherently incomplete higher order unification
algorithms implemented. Finally we introduce in the external syntax the notion
of vector of placeholders that enables to omit at once an arbitrary number of
arguments. Vectors of placeholders allow a trivial implementation of implicit

parameter delta_{RR}^{13} can open the decay channel K -> e nu_tau and enhance
R_K over its Standard-Model value. In the region of the parameter space probed
by NA62 the contribution from a bino-stau loop diagram is numerically dominant
and the mixing between left-handed and right-handed staus is important. For
large values of the stau mixing angle theta_tau the commonly adopted mass
insertion approximation is not accurate. We therefore express the
supersymmetric contribution to R_K in terms of the mass of the lightest stau
eigenstate, the mixing angle theta_tau, and other relevant MSSM parameter such
as tan(beta) and the charged-Higgs boson mass M_H and plot the parameter
regions constrained by R_K. We further study to which extent R_K can be
depleted through MSSM contributions interfering destructively with the SM
amplitude for K -> e nu_e. This lepton-flavour conserving (LFC) mechanism
involves the parameter combination |delta_{LL}^{13} delta_{RR}^{13}|, which can
be constrained with a naturalness consideration for the electron mass or with
the measurement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. The LFC
effect on R_K is marginal, an NA62 measurement of R_K significantly below the

interacting electrons can be characterized by its density operator. This gives
a direct access to the ground-state energy or, at finite temperatures, to the
free energy of the system as well as to other static physical quantities.
Elementary excitations of the system, on the other hand, are described within
the language of Green's functions, i.e. time- or frequency-dependent dynamic
quantities which give a direct access to the linear response of the system
subjected to a weak time-dependent external perturbation. A typical example is
angle-revolved photoemission spectroscopy which is linked to the
single-electron Green's function. Since usually both, the static as well as the
dynamic physical quantities, cannot be obtained exactly for lattice fermion
models like the Hubbard model, one has to resort to approximations. Opposed to
more ad hoc treatments, variational principles promise to provide consistent
and controlled approximations. Here, the Ritz principle and a generalized
version of the Ritz principle at finite temperatures for the static case on the
one hand and a dynamical variational principle for the single-electron Green's
function or the self-energy on the other hand are introduced, discussed in
detail and compared to each other to show up conceptual similarities and
differences. In particular, the construction recipe for non-perturbative
dynamic approximations is taken over from the construction of static mean-field
theory based on the generalized Ritz principle. Within the two different
frameworks, it is shown which types of approximations are accessible, and their
respective weaknesses and strengths are worked out. Static Hartree-Fock theory
as well as dynamical mean-field theory are found as the prototypical

investigated in two dictionaries; Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Wavelet
Transform (WT). The CMB power spectrum can be recovered with only a few
percentage of the coefficients in both of these dictionaries and hence is very
compressible in these dictionaries. We study the performance of these
dictionaries in smoothing a set of simulated power spectra. Based on this, we
develop a technique that estimates the true underlying CMB power spectrum from
data, i.e. without a need to know the cosmological parameters. This smooth
estimated spectrum can be used to simulate CMB maps with similar properties to
the true CMB simulations with the correct cosmological parameters. This allows
us to make Monte Carlo simulations in a given project, without having to know

large tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and tunneling electroresistance (TER)

symmetry-driven spin filtering provided by the insulating BaTiO3 barrier to the
electrons injected from SrRuO3. In contrast the TER is possible only when a
thin SrTiO3 layer is intercalated at one of the SrRuO3/BaTiO3 interfaces. As
the complex band-structure of SrTiO3 has the same symmetry than that of BaTiO3,
the inclusion of such an intercalated layer does not negatively alter the TMR
and in fact increases it. Crucially, the magnitude of the TER also scales with
the thickness of the SrTiO3 layer. The SrTiO3 thickness becomes then a single
control parameter for both the TMR and the TER effect. This protocol offers a
practical way to the fabrication of four-state memory cells.

optical spectrum in quiescence is a composite of a hot white dwarf with Teff =
30000 +- 5000 K and a M3-4 secondary star with narrow emission lines (mainly of
the Balmer series and HeI) superposed. We associate these narrow profiles with
an origin on the donor star. Analysis of the radial velocity curve of the
H-alpha emission from the donor star allowed the measurement of an orbital
period of 0.154095 +- 0.000003 d (3.69828 +- 0.00007 h), different from all
previous estimates. We detected episodic accretion events which veiled the
spectra of both stars and radically changed the line profiles within a
timescale of tens of minutes. This shows that accretion is not completely
quenched in the low state. During these accretion episodes the line wings are
stronger and their radial velocity curve is delayed by ~ 0.2 cycle, similar to
that observed in SW Sex and AM Her stars in the high state, with respect to the
motion of the white dwarf. Two scenarios are proposed to explain the extra
emission: impact of the material on the outer edge of a cold, remnant accretion
disc, or the combined action of a moderately magnetic white dwarf (B1 <~ 5 MG)

dynamics play an essential role. Due to this ubiquity, a multitude of
mathematical models has been developed to describe these processes. While the
simplest models only consider the size of the overall populations, others take
division numbers and labeling of the cells into account. In this work, we
present a modeling and computational framework for proliferating cell
population undergoing symmetric cell division. In contrast to existing models,
the proposed model incorporates both, the discrete age structure and continuous
label dynamics. Thus, it allows for the consideration of division number
dependent parameters as well as the direct comparison of the model prediction
with labeling experiments, e.g., performed with Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl
ester (CFSE). We prove that under mild assumptions the resulting system of
coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) can be decomposed into a system
of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a set of decoupled PDEs, which
reduces the computational effort drastically. Furthermore, the PDEs are solved
analytically and the ODE system is truncated, which allows for the prediction
of the label distribution of complex systems using a low-dimensional system of
ODEs. In addition to modeling of labeling dynamics, we link the label-induced
fluorescence to the measure fluorescence which includes autofluorescence. For
the resulting numerically challenging convolution integral, we provide an
analytical approximation. This is illustrated by modeling and simulating a
proliferating population with division number dependent proliferation rate.

for all filling factors. As the interaction strength increases, it is stable
close to filling factors $n=0$ or $n=1$, and phase separation takes place in

We find the peculiar velocities of the main galaxies, and use principal
component analysis to characterise our results. More than 80% of the clusters
in our sample have substructure according to 3D normal mixture modelling, the
Dressler-Shectman (DS) test shows substructure in about 70% of the clusters.
The median value of the peculiar velocities of the main galaxies in clusters is
206 km/s (41% of the rms velocity). The velocities of galaxies in more than 20%
of the clusters show significant non-Gaussianity. While multidimensional normal
mixture modelling is more sensitive than the DS test in resolving substructure
in the sky distribution of cluster galaxies, the DS test determines better
substructure expressed as tails in the velocity distribution of galaxies.
Richer, larger, and more luminous clusters have larger amount of substructure
and larger (compared to the rms velocity) peculiar velocities of the main
galaxies. Principal component analysis of both the substructure indicators and
the physical parameters of clusters shows that galaxy clusters are complicated
objects, the properties of which cannot be explained with a small number of
parameters or delimited by one single test. The presence of substructure, the
non-Gaussian velocity distributions, as well as the large peculiar velocities
of the main galaxies, shows that most of the clusters in our sample are

four business verticals scattered in Europe, United States and Asia. The
services of Software Quality Analyst (SQA) from different vendors were
leveraged to facilitate implementation of processes which was referred to as
the Quality Management System (QMS). To co-ordinate and support QMS
implementation, a Software Quality Assurance Group (SQAG) was established at
the organizational level. Considering the large number of applications, the
business verticals proposed that process implementation should be owned and
managed by practitioners themselves so that the mass deployment of QMS can be
achieved at a faster rate with the same SQA capacity. This called for a need to
devise an innovative implementation solution before moving to a process
implementation model which proposed Project Managers implementing processes
themself. While there are process models and frameworks available in the market
for establishing processes in an organization, there is no model that
elaborates activities to be performed by the SQA for effective implementation
of processes. SQA service maturity model was proposed as a solution based on
CMMI\textregistered and developed to eventually proceed towards a 'Process
Implementation Model proposing Project Managers implementing processes

  SQA Service Maturity Model is a Software Quality Assurance implementation
framework that enables organisations to increase Efficiencies in Software
Quality Assurance, reduce the Cost of Defects and ultimately Increasing Return

We focus our attention on factorization of the hard-collinear scale $\sim

leading order jet functions and find that the convolution integrals over the
soft fractions are logarithmically divergent. This divergency is the
consequence of the boost invariance and does not depend on the model of the
soft correlation function describing the soft spectator quarks. Using as
example a two-loop diagram we demonstrated that such a divergency corresponds
to the overlap of the soft and collinear regions. As a result one obtains large
rapidity logarithm which must be included in the correct factorization
formalism. We conclude that a consistent description of the factorization for
$F_{1}$ implies the end-point collinear divergencies in the hard and soft
spectator contributions, i.e. convolution integrals with respect to collinear
fractions are not well-defined. Such scenario can only be realized when the
twist-3 nucleon distribution amplitude has specific end-point behavior which
differs from one expected from the evolution of the nucleon distribution
amplitude. Such behavior leads to the violation of the collinear factorization
for the hard spectator scattering contribution. We suggest that the soft
spectator scattering and chiral symmetry breaking provide the mechanism
responsible for the violation of collinear factorization in case of form factor

We consider natural Markov chains for sampling uniformly from the set of

3-orientations of a fixed triangulation that reverses the orientation of the
edges around a triangle in each move. It was shown previously that this chain
connects the state space and we show that (i) when restricted to planar
triangulations of maximum degree six, the Markov chain is rapidly mixing, and
(ii) there exists a triangulation with high degree on which this Markov chain
mixes slowly. Next, we consider an ""edge-flipping"" chain on the larger state
space consisting of 3-orientations of all planar triangulations on a fixed
number of vertices. It was also shown previously that this chain connects the
state space and we prove that the chain is always rapidly mixing. The
triangle-reversing and edge-flipping Markov chains both arise in the context of

investigated. The pump has no moving parts and consists of a thermal resistor
placed asymmetrically within a straight channel connecting two reservoirs.
Using numerical simulations, the net flow is studied as a function of channel
geometry, resistor location, vapor bubble strength, fluid viscosity, and
surface tension. Two major regimes of behavior are identified: axial and
non-axial. In the axial regime, the drive bubble either remains inside the
channel or continues to grow axially when it reaches the reservoir. In the
non-axial regime the bubble grows out of the channel and in all three
dimensions while inside the reservoir. The net flow in the axial regime is
parabolic with respect to the hydraulic diameter of the channel cross-section
but in the non-axial regime it is not. From numerical modeling, it is
determined that the net flow is maximal when the axial regime crosses over to
the non-axial regime. To elucidate the basic physical principles of the pump, a
phenomenological one-dimensional model is developed and solved. A linear array
of micropumps has been built using silicon-SU8 fabrication technology, and
semi-continuous pumping across a 2 mm-wide channel has been demonstrated
experimentally. Measured variation of the net flow with fluid viscosity is in

a novel phenomenological quark-neutrino (N+1)-color and 3 mixing angle

related to the fine structure constant one empirical small parameter, that
benchmark pattern determines realistic quark and neutrino mixing angles in good

quantum level using as a guiding examples some systems where a particle is
constrained to move on a radial symmetric, but non planar, surface. In
particular, two systems are studied: the case of a cone with an arbitrary
contour or dunce hat billiard and the rectangular billiard with an inner
Gaussian surface.

frictional interfaces (contact areas developments). Here, we analyze the
dynamics of static friction. We found, under the correlation measure, the
fraction of triangles correlates with the detachment fronts. Also, for all
types of the loops (such as triangles), there is a universal power law between
nodes' degree and motifs where motifs frequency follow a power law. This shows
high energy localization is characterized by fast variation of the loops
fraction. Also, this proves that the congestion of loops occurs around hubs.
Furthermore, the motif distributions and modularity space of networks -in terms
of within-module degree and participation coefficient- show universal trends,
indicating an in common aspect of energy flow in shear ruptures. Moreover, we
confirmed that slow ruptures generally hold small localization, while regular
ruptures carry a high level of energy localization. We proposed that
assortativity, as an index to correlation of node's degree, can uncover
acoustic features of the interfaces. We showed that increasing assortativity
induces a nearly silent period of fault's activities. Also, we proposed that
slow ruptures resulted from within-module developments rather than
extra-modules of the networks. Our approach presents a completely new
perspective of the evolution of shear ruptures.

accordingly, in order to improve power transmission and distribution. For the
grids to operate effectively, it is critical to collect readings from
massively-installed smart meters to control centers in an efficient and secure
manner. In this paper, we propose a secure compressed reading scheme to address
this critical issue. We observe that our collected real-world meter data
express strong temporal correlations, indicating they are sparse in certain
domains. We adopt Compressed Sensing technique to exploit this sparsity and
design an efficient meter data transmission scheme. Our scheme achieves
substantial efficiency offered by compressed sensing, without the need to know
beforehand in which domain the meter data are sparse. This is in contrast to
traditional compressed-sensing based scheme where such sparse-domain
information is required a priori. We then design specific dependable scheme to
work with our compressed sensing based data transmission scheme to make our
meter reading reliable and secure. We provide performance guarantee for the
correctness, efficiency, and security of our proposed scheme. Through analysis
and simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes and compare
their performance to prior arts.

measuring device on the experiment. The consideration of these facts led, in
thermodynamics, to a new one-parameter family of ideal gases. In turn, this
leads to a new approach to probability theory (including the new notion of
independent events). As applied to economics, this gives the correction, based
on Friedman's rule, to Irving Fisher's ""Main Law of Economics"" and enables us
to consider the theory of debt crisis.
