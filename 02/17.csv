caricature of a Maxwellian gas to inelastic particles. We show that the
probability distribution, solution of the relative Cauchy problem, converges
weakly to a probability distribution if and only if the symmetrized initial
distribution belongs to the standard domain of attraction of a symmetric stable
law, whose index $\alpha$ is determined by the so-called degree of
inelasticity, $p>0$, of the particles: $\alpha=\frac{2}{1+p}$. This result is
then used: (1) To state that the class of all stationary solutions coincides
with that of all symmetric stable laws with index $\alpha$. (2) To determine
the solution of a well-known stochastic functional equation in the absence of

forms: that due to Aquinas, and the revised version of the Kalam Cosmological
Argument more recently advocated by William Lane Craig. We formulate these two
arguments in such a way that each conclusion follows in first-order logic from
the corresponding assumptions. Our analysis shows that the conclusion which
follows for Aquinas is considerably weaker than what his aims demand. With
formalizations that are logically valid in hand, we reinterpret the natural
language versions of the premises and conclusions in terms of concepts of
causality consistent with (and used in) recent work in cosmology done by
physicists. In brief: the Kalam argument commits the fallacy of equivocation in
a way that seems beyond repair; two of the premises adopted by Aquinas seem
dubious when the terms `cause' and `causality' are interpreted in the context
of contemporary empirical science. Thus, while there are no problems with
whether the conclusions follow logically from their assumptions, the Kalam
argument is not viable, and the Aquinas argument does not imply a caused
origination of the universe. The assumptions of the latter are at best less
than obvious relative to recent work in the sciences. We conclude with mention
of a new argument that makes some positive modifications to an alternative
variation on Aquinas by Le Poidevin, which nonetheless seems rather weak.

want to identify jet-driving protostars as a tracer of the currently forming
generation of stars in the Carina Nebula, which is one of the most massive
galactic star-forming regions and which is characterised by particularly high
levels of massive-star feedback on the surrounding clouds.
  Methods: We used archive data to construct large (> 2 deg x 2 deg) Spitzer
IRAC mosaics of the Carina Nebula and performed a spatially complete search for
objects with excesses in the 4.5 micron band, typical of shock-excited
molecular hydrogen emission. We also identified the mid-infrared point sources
that are the likely drivers of previously discovered Herbig-Haro jets and
molecular hydrogen emission line objects. We combined the Spitzer photometry
with our recent Herschel far-infrared data to construct the spectral energy
distributions, and used the Robitaille radiative-transfer modelling tool to
infer the properties of the objects.
  Results: The radiative-transfer modelling suggests that the jet sources are
protostars with masses between ~1 M_sol and ~10 M_sol that are surrounded by
circumstellar disks and embedded in circumstellar envelopes.
  Conclusions: The estimated protostar masses < 10 M_sol suggest that the
current star-formation activity in the Carina Nebula is restricted to low- and
intermediate-mass stars. More optical than infrared jets can be observed,
indicating that star formation predominantly takes place close to the surfaces
of clouds.

implies the presence of waves in a topologically varied magnetic environment.
Here, the interaction of waves with topological features such as null points is
inevitable and potentially important for energetics. The low resistivity of the
solar coronal plasma implies that non-MHD effects should be considered in
studies of magnetic energy release in this environment. This paper investigates
the role of the Hall term in the propagation and dissipation of waves, their
interaction with 2D magnetic X-points and the nature of the resulting
reconnection. A Lagrangian remap shock-capturing code (Lare2d) is used to study
the evolution of an initial fast magnetoacoustic wave annulus for a range of
values of the ion skin depth in resistive Hall MHD. A magnetic null-point
finding algorithm is also used to locate and track the evolution of the
multiple null-points that are formed in the system. Depending on the ratio of
ion skin depth to system size, our model demonstrates that Hall effects can
play a key role in the wave-null interaction. In particular, the initial
fast-wave pulse now consists of whistler and ion-cyclotron components; the
dispersive nature of the whistler wave leads to (i) earlier interaction with
the null, (ii) the creation of multiple additional, transient nulls and, hence,
an increased number of energy release sites. In the Hall regime, the relevant
timescales (such as the onset of reconnection and the period of the oscillatory
relaxation) of the system are reduced significantly, and the reconnection rate
is enhanced.

The NFT decorrelates signal degrees-of-freedom in such models, in much the same
way that the Fourier transform does for linear systems. In this three-part
series of papers, this observation is exploited for data transmission over
integrable channels such as optical fibers, where pulse propagation is governed
by the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. In this transmission scheme, which can
be viewed as a nonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
commonly used in linear channels, information is encoded in the nonlinear
frequencies and their spectral amplitudes. Unlike most other fiber-optic
transmission schemes, this technique deals with both dispersion and
nonlinearity directly and unconditionally without the need for dispersion or

short-range magnetic correlations choose the ordering vector (pi,0) over the
equivalent (0,pi) and thus break the fourfold rotation symmetry of the
underlying lattice without inducing long-range magnetic order. In excellent
agreement with angle resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES), we find that
the yz bands at X move to higher energies. When onsite Coulomb repulsion brings
the system close to a spin--density-wave (SDW) and renormalizes the band width
by a factor of approx. 2, even small anisotropic couplings of 10 to 15 meV
strongly distort the bands, splitting the formerly degenerate states at X and Y
by approx. 70 meV and shifting the yz states at X above the chemical potential.
This similarity to the SDW bands is in excellent agreement with ARPES. An
important difference to the SDW bands is that the yz bands still cross the
Fermi level, again in agreement with experiment. We find that orbital weights
near the Fermi surface provide a better characterization than overall orbital
densities and orbital polarization.

rank analysis. We find the sizes of our Plutinos to range from 150 to 730 km
and geometric albedos to vary between 0.04 and 0.28. The average albedo of the

Jupiter Family comets and other Trans-Neptunian Objects. We were able to
calibrate the Plutino size scale for the first time and find the cumulative
Plutino size distribution to be best fit using a cumulative power law with q =

our sample. There is qualitative evidence that icy Plutinos have higher albedos
than the average of the sample.

wide range of applications. As a model problem for clustering, we consider the
densest k-disjoint-clique problem, whose goal is to identify the collection of
k disjoint cliques of a given weighted complete graph maximizing the sum of the
densities of the complete subgraphs induced by these cliques. In this paper, we
establish conditions ensuring exact recovery of the densest k cliques of a
given graph from the optimal solution of a particular semidefinite program. In
particular, the semidefinite relaxation is exact for input graphs corresponding
to data consisting of k large, distinct clusters and a smaller number of
outliers. This approach also yields a semidefinite relaxation for the
biclustering problem with similar recovery guarantees. Given a set of objects
and a set of features exhibited by these objects, biclustering seeks to
simultaneously group the objects and features according to their expression
levels. This problem may be posed as partitioning the nodes of a weighted
bipartite complete graph such that the sum of the densities of the resulting
bipartite complete subgraphs is maximized. As in our analysis of the densest
k-disjoint-clique problem, we show that the correct partition of the objects

experiments supporting these theoretical guarantees is also provided.

decay of the time autocorrelation function of the first normal mode. We found
that the friction coefficient at small slip velocities exhibits a distinct
maximum which appears due to shear-induced alignment of semiflexible chain
segments in contact with solid walls. At large slip velocities the decay of the
friction coefficient is independent of the chain stiffness. The data for the
friction coefficient and shear viscosity are used to elucidate main trends in
the nonlinear shear rate dependence of the slip length. The influence of chain
stiffness on the relationship between the friction coefficient and the

is a limiting case of the magneto-elliptic instability (MEI). This limit is
obtained for horizontal modes in the presence of rotation and an external
vertical magnetic field, when the aspect ratio of the elliptic streamlines
tends to infinite. In this paper we unveil the link between these previously
unconnected mechanisms, explaining both the MEI and the MRI as different
manifestations of the same Magneto-Elliptic-Rotational Instability (MERI). The
growth rates are found and the influence of the magnetic and rotational effects
is explained, in particular the effect of the magnetic field on the range of
negative Rossby numbers at which the horizontal instability is excited.
Furthermore, we show how the horizontal rotational MEI in the rotating shear
flow limit links to the MRI by the use of the local shearing box model,
typically used in the study of accretion discs. In such limit the growth rates
of the two instability types coincide for any power-type background angular
velocity radial profile with negative exponent corresponding to the value of
the Rossby number of the rotating shear flow. The MRI requirement for
instability is that the background angular velocity profile is a decreasing
function of the distance from the centre of the disk which corresponds to the
horizontal rotational MEI requirement of negative Rossby numbers. Finally a
physical interpretation of the horizontal instability, based on a balance
between the strain, the Lorentz force and the Coriolis force is given.

admit such a decomposition with B_1, ..., B_p having independent images. We
give a simple intrinsic characterization of this class of states, and starting
with a density matrix in this class, describe a procedure to find such a

this to the facial structure of the set of separable states.
  A special subclass of such separable states are those for which the rank of
the matrix matches one marginal rank. Such states have arisen in previous
studies of separability (e.g., they are known to be a class for which the PPT
condition is equivalent to separability).

terrestrial bow shock into a region known as the electron foreshock. Previously
observed electron spectra at low energies are consistent with a fast Fermi
mechanism, based on the adiabatic conservation of the magnetic moment ({\mu})
of the accelerated electrons. At higher energies, suprathermal power law tails
are observed beyond the level predicted by fast Fermi. The SWEA and STE
electron detectors on STEREO enable measurements of foreshock electrons with
good energy resolution and sensitivity over the entire foreshock beam. We
investigate the electron acceleration mechanism by comparing observed STEREO
electron spectra with predictions based on a Liouville mapping of upstream
electrons through a shock encounter. The foreshock electron beam extends up to
several tens of keV, energies for which the Larmor radii of electrons is tens
of km or greater. These radii are comparable to the scale sizes of the shock,
and {\mu} conservation no longer applies. We show that the observed enhancement
in the foreshock beam beyond fast Fermi levels begins at energies where this
assumption breaks down. We also demonstrate, using the Liouville mapping
technique, that the strahl plays an important role in the formation of the bump
on tail instability. We discuss this in the context of recent observations in
the foreshock and in solar wind magnetic holes.

be competitive while optimizing their resource usage to keep costs down. Richer
service offerings include new resource request models involving bandwidth
guarantees between virtual machines (VMs). Thus we consider the following
problem: given a VM request graph (where nodes are VMs and edges represent
virtual network connectivity between the VMs) and a real data center topology,
find an allocation of VMs to servers that satisfies the bandwidth guarantees
for every virtual network edge---which maps to a path in the physical
network---and minimizes congestion of the network.
  Previous work has shown that for arbitrary networks and requests, finding the
optimal embedding satisfying bandwidth requests is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard.
However, in most data center architectures, the routing protocols employed are
based on a spanning tree of the physical network. In this paper, we prove that
the problem remains $\mathcal{NP}$-hard even when the physical network topology
is restricted to be a tree, and the request graph topology is also restricted.
We also present a dynamic programming algorithm for computing the optimal
embedding in a tree network which runs in time $O(3^kn)$, where $n$ is the
number of nodes in the physical topology and $k$ is the size of the request
graph, which is well suited for practical requests which have small $k$. Such
requests form a large class of web-service and enterprise workloads. Also, if
we restrict the requests topology to a clique (all VMs connected to a virtual
switch with uniform bandwidth requirements), we show that the dynamic
programming algorithm can be modified to output the minimum congestion
embedding in time $O(k^2n)$.

thus the limit of the solution is not in the state space of integrable

The focus of this paper is to extend the analysis to include the long-time

finite signed Borel measures are asymptotically closed. This means that if the
initial condition is a finite signed Borel measure and if the asymptotic limit
of the model solution exists, then it will be a measure (note that function
spaces such as L1(Q) and C(Q) do not have this property). We also establish
permanence results for the full replicator mutator model. Then, we study the
asymptotic analysis in the case where there is more than one strategy of a
given fitness (a continuum of strategies of a given fitness), a case that often
arises in applications. To study this case our mathematical structure must
include the ability to demonstrate the convergence of the model solution to a
measure supported on a continuum of strategies. For this purpose, we
demonstrate how to perform completions of the space of measures and how to use
these completions to formulate weak (generalized) asymptotic limits. In
particular, we show that for the pure replicator dynamics the (weak) solution

evidence of rotations and permanent deformations in structures were observed.
To analyze these aspects and study the source properties from the near field,
the displacement time histories were obtained including the static component at
Lorca station. Displacement time histories were computed by an appropriate
double time integration procedure of accelerograms. Using these data, the
foreshock and mainshock slip distributions were calculated by means of a
complete waveform kinematic inversion. To study the dynamic deformations, the
3D tensor of displacement gradients at Lorca station was first estimated by a
single station method. Using the finite fault inversion results and by means of
a first order finite difference approach, the dynamic deformations tensor at
surface was calculated at the recording site. In order to estimate the
distribution of the peak dynamic deformations, the calculation was extended to
the close neighboring area of the town. The possible influence of the
near-field deformations on the surface structures was analyzed.

their infrared emissions are consistent with warm dust produced by the tidal

to 53 and 38 respectively. It also nearly doubles the number of metal-polluted

the increased statistics for both atmospheric types with circumstellar dust, we
derive a typical disk lifetime of log[t_{disk} (yr)] = 5.6+-1.1 (ranging from
3*10^4 - 5*10^6 yr). This assumes a relatively constant rate of accretion over
the timescale where dust persists, which is uncertain. We find that the
fraction of highly metal-polluted helium-rich white dwarfs that have an
infrared excess detected by Spitzer is only 23 per cent, compared to 48 per
cent for metal-polluted hydrogen-rich white dwarfs, and we conclude from this
difference that the typical lifetime of dusty disks is somewhat shorter than
the diffusion time scales of helium-rich white dwarf. We also find evidence for
higher time-averaged accretion rates onto helium-rich stars compared to the
instantaneous accretion rates onto hydrogen-rich stars; this is an indication
that our picture of evolved star-planetary system interactions is incomplete.

distributions of star spots. Our aim is to determine if, with continuous
observation (such as the data that will be provided by the Kepler mission), we
can in addition measure the rate of drift of the spot belts. We begin by
simulating magnetic cycles suitable for the Sun and more active stars,
incorporating both flux emergence and surface transport. This provides the
radial magnetic field distribution on the stellar surface as a function of
time. We then model the transit of a planet whose orbital axis is misaligned
with the stellar rotation axis. Such a planet could occult spots at a range of
latitudes. This allows us to complete the forward modelling of the shape of the
transit lightcurve. We then attempt the inverse problem of recovering spot
locations from the transit alone. From this we determine if transit lightcurves
can be used to measure spot belt locations as a function of time. We find that
for low-activity stars such as the Sun, the 3.5 year Kepler window is
insufficient to determine this drift rate. For more active stars, it may be
difficult to distinguish subtle differences in the nature of flux emergence,
such as the degree of overlap of the ""butterfly wings"". The rate and direction
of drift of the spot belts can however be determined for these stars. This
would provide a critical test of dynamo theory.

Survey first data release, we investigate the interplay between the brightest
cluster galaxy (BCG), its black hole, and the intra-cluster/group medium (ICM).
It appears that for groups and clusters with a BCG likely to host significant
AGN feedback, gas cooling dominates in those with Tx > 2 keV while AGN feedback
dominates below. This may be understood through the sub-unity exponent found in
the scaling relation we derive between the BCG mass and cluster mass over the
halo mass range 10^13 < M500 < 10^15Msol and the lack of correlation between
radio luminosity and cluster mass, such that BCG AGN in groups can have
relatively more energetic influence on the ICM. The Lx - Tx relation for
systems with the most massive BCGs, or those with BCGs co-located with the peak
of the ICM emission, is steeper than that for those with the least massive and
most offset, which instead follows self-similarity. This is evidence that a
combination of central gas cooling and powerful, well fuelled AGN causes the
departure of the ICM from pure gravitational heating, with the steepened
relation crossing self-similarity at Tx = 2 keV. Importantly, regardless of
their black hole mass, BCGs are more likely to host radio-loud AGN if they are
in a massive cluster (Tx > 2 keV) and again co-located with an effective fuel
supply of dense, cooling gas. This demonstrates that the most massive black
holes appear to know more about their host cluster than they do about their
host galaxy. The results lead us to propose a physically motivated, empirical
definition of 'cluster' and 'group', delineated at 2 keV.

primordial white dwarf material and its relation to SN Ia explosion scenarios
and mechanisms. In this paper, we search for C absorption features in 188
optical spectra of 144 low-redshift (z < 0.1) SNe Ia with ages <3.6 d after
maximum brightness. These data were obtained as part of the Berkeley SN Ia
Program (BSNIP; Silverman et al. 2012) and represent the largest set of SNe Ia
in which C has ever been searched. We find that ~11 per cent of the SNe studied
show definite C absorption features while ~25 per cent show some evidence for C
II in their spectra. Also, if one obtains a spectrum at t < -5 d, then there is
a better than 30 per cent chance of detecting a distinct absorption feature
from C II. SNe Ia that show C are found to resemble those without C in many
respects, but objects with C tend to have bluer optical colours than those
without C. The typical expansion velocity of the C II {\lambda}6580 feature is
measured to be 12,000-13,000 km/s, and the ratio of the C II {\lambda}6580 to
Si II {\lambda}6355 velocities is remarkably constant with time and among
different objects with a median value of ~1.05. While the pseudo-equivalent
widths (pEWs) of the C II {\lambda}6580 and C II {\lambda}7234 features are
found mostly to decrease with time, we see evidence of a significant increase
in pEW between ~12 and 11 d before maximum brightness, which is actually
predicted by some theoretical models. The range of pEWs measured from the BSNIP

and color correlations and parton-exchange interference terms contribute, even
for unpolarized beams. Soft radiation effects are nontrivial for the color
correlation and interference contributions, and are described by
non-perturbative soft functions. We provide a field-theoretic definition of the
quark dPDFs and study some of their basic properties, including discrete
symmetries and their interpretation in a non-relativistic quark model. We
calculate the renormalization group evolution of the quark dPDFs and of the
soft functions. The evolution receives contributions from both ultraviolet and
rapidity divergences. We find that color correlation and interference effects
are Sudakov suppressed, greatly reducing the number of dPDFs needed to describe
double parton scattering at high energy experiments.

direct CP asymmetry in D0 -> K+ K- and D0 -> pi+ pi- decays can be accommodated
in the Standard Model (SM) or extensions with a constrained flavour sector, for
instance from a sequential 4th generation of quarks (4G). From the comparison
with D0 -> K- pi+ branching ratios, we establish large U-spin symmetry (d <->
s) breaking effects with large strong phases between different interfering
amplitudes. On the basis of conservative estimates on amplitude ratios - which
are supported by an analysis of the breaking of a (c <-> u) symmetry in
non-leptonic B0 decays - we find that, in the SM, direct CP asymmetries in the
pi+ pi- or K+ K- modes (or in their difference) of the order of several per
mille are still plausible. Due to the constraints on the new CP phases in the
4G model, only moderate effects compared to the SM estimates are possible. We
suggest CP studies at LHCb as well as at (Super)B-factories of several
distinctive modes, such as D+ -> Kbar(*)0 pi+, phi pi+ and Ds -> K(*)0 pi+, phi
pi+ (K+) etc., which should shed more light on the short- and long-distance

modeled with a first order reaction of the Butler-Volmer type. The equations

derived under the assumption that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide occurs
mainly without inducing an electric current. We find that the swimming speed
increases linearly with hydrogen peroxide concentration for small

a concave shape of the function of speed vs. hydrogen peroxide concentration.
The compact layer of ions on the particle diminishes the reaction rate and
consequently reduces the speed. Our results are consistent with published

theoretical approach to flavour physics, with special attention to cosmological
applications. Neutrino flavour oscillation is nowadays a fairly
well-established experimental fact. However, the formulation of flavour
oscillations in a relativistic field theoretical framework presents non-trivial
difficulties. A nonperturbative approach for building flavour states has been
proposed by Blasone, Vitiello and coworkers. The formalism implies a
non-trivial physical vacuum (called ""flavour vacuum""), which might act as a
source of Dark Energy. Furthermore, such a vacuum has been recognized as the
effective vacuum state arising in the low energy limit of a string theoretical
model, D-particle Foam Model. In the attempt of probing the observable
phenomenology of the D-particle foam model, a simple toy model (two scalars
with mixing \`a la Blasone & Vitiello on a adiabatically expanding background)
has been studied, proving that the flavour vacuum might behave as Dark Energy
under certain assumptions. The first work presented in this thesis represents a
development of this approach. A more realistic model is considered, which
includes two flavoured Dirac fermions on a generic Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
universe. In this framework we show that the flavour vacuum presents different
features, which are incompatible with Dark Energy. Motivated by this
discrepancy, we next embark on the analysis of a simple supersymmetric model in
flat spacetime (free Wess-Zumino), proving that the bosonic component of
flavour vacuum acts as Dark Energy, whereas the fermionic as a source of Dark
Matter. Finally we develop a new method of calculation that open the way to a
nonperturbative extension of these results for interactive theories.

photon waste associated with lucky imaging by combining this method with
shift-and-add.
  A simple probabilistic model for the dark output of an EMCCD is developed.
Fitting this model with the expectation-maximization algorithm allows us to
estimate the bias, readout noise, amplification, and spurious charge rate per
pixel and thus correct for these phenomena. To investigate the stability of the
photometry, corrected frames of a crowded field are reduced with a PSF fitting
photometry package, where a lucky image is used as a reference.
  We find that it is possible to develop an algorithm that elegantly reduces
EMCCD data and produces stable photometry at the 1% level in an extremely
crowded field.

three (possibly four) stars around [Fe/H] =-2.7 that are highly clustered in a
multi-dimensional chemical abundance space. The estimated initial stellar mass
of the cluster is M*,init = 1.9^+1.5_-0.9 (1.6^+1.2_-0.8)*10^5 Msol assuming a
Salpeter (Kroupa) initial mass function (IMF). If corroborated by follow-up
spectroscopy, this ancient star cluster at [Fe/H] =-2.7 is the most metal-poor
system identified to date. Inspired by this finding, we also present a new way
to interpret the cumulative metallicity functions of dwarf galaxies. From
available observational data, we speculate that the ultra-faint dwarf galaxy
population, or a significant fraction thereof, and the more luminous, classical
dwarf spheroidal population were formed in different environments and would
thus be distinct in origin.

the infinite-dimensional model in which $[x,p]=i$ holds on the nose. This

finite-dimensionality entails the relation $UV^{-1}UV=V^{-1}UVU$; this

are not designed to explore the trade-offs between the competing objectives
between the tumor and normal tissues. Our goal was to develop an efficient
multiobjective optimization algorithm that was flexible enough to handle any
form of objective function and that resulted in a set of Pareto optimal plans.
  Methods: We developed a hierarchical evolutionary multiobjective algorithm
designed to quickly generate a diverse Pareto optimal set of IMRT plans that
meet all clinical constraints and reflect the trade-offs in the plans. The top
level of the hierarchical algorithm is a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm
(MOEA). The genes of the individuals generated in the MOEA are the parameters
that define the penalty function minimized during an accelerated deterministic
IMRT optimization that represents the bottom level of the hierarchy. The MOEA
incorporates clinical criteria to restrict the search space through protocol
objectives and then uses Pareto optimality among the fitness objectives to
select individuals.
  Results: Acceleration techniques implemented on both levels of the
hierarchical algorithm resulted in short, practical runtimes for optimizations.
The MOEA improvements were evaluated for example prostate cases with one target
and two OARs. The modified MOEA dominated 11.3% of plans using a standard
genetic algorithm package. By implementing domination advantage and protocol
objectives, small diverse populations of clinically acceptable plans that were
only dominated 0.2% by the Pareto front could be generated in a fraction of an
hour.
  Conclusions: Our MOEA produces a diverse Pareto optimal set of plans that
meet all dosimetric protocol criteria in a feasible amount of time. It
optimizes not only beamlet intensities but also objective function parameters
on a patient-specific basis.

studies. Ultimately, constraining spatial and temporal properties of an
exoplanet atmosphere will provide further insight into its physics. For
tidally-locked hot Jupiters that transit and are eclipsed by their host star,
the first steps are now possible.
  Our aim is to constrain an exoplanet's shape, brightness distribution (BD)
and system parameters from its light curve. Notably, we rely on the eclipse
scanning.
  We use archived Spitzer 8-{\mu}m data of HD189733 (6 transits, 8 secondary
eclipses, and a phase curve) in a global MCMC procedure for mitigating
systematics. We also include HD189733's out-of-transit radial velocity
measurements.
  We find a 6-{\sigma} deviation from the expected occultation of a
uniformly-bright disk. This deviation emerges mainly from HD189733b's thermal
pattern, not from its shape. We indicate that the correlation of the orbital
eccentricity, e, and BD (uniform time offset) does also depend on the stellar
density, \rho*, and the impact parameter, b (e-b-\rho*-BD correlation). For
HD189733b, we find that relaxing the e-constraint and using more complex BDs
lead to lower stellar/planetary densities and a more localized and
latitudinally-shifted hot spot. We obtain an improved constraint on the upper
limit of HD189733b's orbital eccentricity, e<0.011 (95%), when including the RV
measurements.
  Our study provides new insights into the analysis of exoplanet light curves
and a proper framework for future eclipse-scanning observations. Observations
of the same exoplanet at different wavelengths will improve the constraints on
its system parameters while ultimately yielding a large-scale time-dependent 3D
map of its atmosphere. Finally, we discuss the perspective of extending our
method to observations in the visible, in particular to better understand
exoplanet albedos.

pseudogap is closely connected to the superconducting gap, indicating the
possibility of its being a precursor of superconductivity. The doping
dependence of the gaps is also supportive of such a scenario.

computational biology. Especially powerful are models which take account of the
heterogeneous nature of sequence evolution according to the ""grammar"" of the
encoded gene features. However, beyond a modest level of model complexity,
manual coding of models becomes prohibitively labor-intensive. We demonstrate,
via a set of case studies, the new built-in model-prototyping capabilities of
XRate (macros and Scheme extensions). These features allow rapid implementation
of phylogenetic models which would have previously been far more
labor-intensive. XRate's new capabilities for lineage-specific models,
ancestral sequence reconstruction, and improved annotation output are also
discussed. XRate's flexible model-specification capabilities and computational
efficiency make it well-suited to developing and prototyping phylogenetic
grammar models. XRate is available as part of the DART software package:

Spectrometer, we have conducted a snap-shot survey of pulsars previously
undetected in X-rays. We detected 12 pulsars and established deep flux limits
for 11 pulsars. Using these new results, we revisit the relationship between
the X-ray luminosity, L_psr_x, and spin-down power, Edot. We find that the
obtained limits further increase the extremely large spread in the non-thermal
X-ray efficiencies, eta_psr_x=L_psr_x/Edot, with some of them being now below
1e-5. Such a spread cannot be explained by poorly known distances or by beaming
of pulsar radiation. We also find evidence of a break in the dependence of
L_psr_x on Edot, such that pulsars become more X-ray efficient at Edot<~
1e34-1e35 erg/s. We examine the relationship between the gamma-ray luminosity,
L_psr_g, and Edot, which exhibits a smaller scatter compared to that in X-rays.
This confirms that the very large spread in the X-ray efficiencies cannot be
explained just by beaming because the gamma-ray emission is generally expected
to be beamed stronger than the X-ray emission. Intriguingly, there is also an
indication of a break in the L_psr_g(Edot) dependence at Edot~1e35 erg/s, with
lower-Edot pulsars becoming less gamma-ray efficient. We also examine the
distance-independent L_psr_f/L_psr_x ratio as a function of Edot for a sample
of gamma-ray pulsars observed by Chandra and find that it peaks at Edot~1e35
erg/s, showing that the breaks cannot originate from poorly measured distances.
We discuss the implications of our findings for existing models of
magnetospheric emission and venues for further exploration.

vector meson-baryon (VB) interaction, which we studied with the motivation of
finding dynamical generation of resonances in the corresponding systems. We
started our study by building a formalism based on the hidden local symmetry
and calculating the leading order contributions to the scattering equations by
summing the diagrams with: (a) a vector meson exchange in the t-channel (b) an
octet baryon exchange in the s-, u-channels and (c) a contact interaction
arising from the part of the vector meson-baryon Lagrangian which is related to
the anomalous magnetic moment of the baryons. We find the contribution from all
these sources, except the s-channel, to be important. The amplitudes obtained
by solving the coupled channel Bethe-Salpeter equations for the systems with
total strangeness zero, show generation of one isospin 3/2, spin 1/2 resonance
and three isospin 1/2 resonances: two with spin 3/2 and one with spin 1/2. We
identify these resonances with $\Delta$ (1900) $S_{31}$, $N^*$(2080) $D_{13}$,
$N^*$(1700) $D_{13}$, and $N^*$(2090) $S_{11}$, respectively.
  We have further extended our study by including pseudoscalar meson-baryon
(PB) as the coupled channels of VB systems. For this, we obtain the PB
$\rightarrow$ VB amplitudes by using the Kroll-Ruddermann term where,
considering the vector meson dominance phenomena, the photon is replaced by a
vector meson. The calculations done within this formalism reveal a very strong
coupling of the VB channels to the low-lying resonances like $\Lambda$(1405)
and $\Lambda$(1670), which can have important implications on certain reactions
producing them. In addition to this, we find that the effect of coupling the
higher mass states to the lighter channels is not restricted to increasing the
width of those states, it can be far more strong.

of hadronization is in good agreement with the measurements even at forward

partonic effects are smaller than that at RHIC energy, based on the comparison
of the measured photon v_{2} with those from the AMPT default and UrQMD model
calculations. We find that if the measurements in RHIC beam energy scan (BES)

the AMPT models, then the observed longitudinal scaling of v_{2} at top RHIC
energies (19.6-200 GeV) will be violated. We also discuss the relation between
the inclusive photon v_{2} and those of their parent \pi^{0}'s for the beam

on the system in pure classical envi- ronment, while others study the system in

interacting system in composite environments made up of both classical and
quantized field. In this letter, we analyze a quantum system composed of two
interacting spins, of which one is in classical magnetic field and the other is
in quantized field. First, classical magnetic field driven Berry phases for the
whole system and subsystem are studied. The effect of couplings between
particles and photon on these phases are analyzed. In comparison with the
dynamical quantized field, We find that even a static quantized field in its
vacuum state can also have an effect on Berry phase. Second, quantized field
driven Berry phases for the whole system and sub- system are formulated,
including both one and two mode of this field. The vacuum induced effects are
elaborated, moreover compared with the constant vacuum induced phases in former
papers, the counterpart in this letter varies according to classical magnetic
field, couplings and other pa- rameters. For the two mode quantized field, the
rigorous relationship between the concurrence and Berry phase for subsystem are
built up.

coherent tangent bundles on 22-dimensional manifolds were proven, and several

one of these two Gauss-Bonnet formulas can be generalized to an index formula

applications to hypersurface theory. Moreover, as an application for intrinsic

used in iterative linear solvers. The same sparse matrix is multiplied by a
dense vector repeatedly in these solvers. Matrices with irregular sparsity
patterns make it difficult to utilize cache locality effectively in SpMxV
computations. In this work, we investigate single- and multiple-SpMxV
frameworks for exploiting cache locality in SpMxV computations. For the
single-SpMxV framework, we propose two cache-size-aware top-down
row/column-reordering methods based on 1D and 2D sparse matrix partitioning by
utilizing the column-net and enhancing the row-column-net hypergraph models of
sparse matrices. The multiple-SpMxV framework depends on splitting a given
matrix into a sum of multiple nonzero-disjoint matrices so that the SpMxV
operation is performed as a sequence of multiple input- and output- dependent
SpMxV operations. For an effective matrix splitting required in this framework,
we propose a cache- size-aware top-down approach based on 2D sparse matrix
partitioning by utilizing the row-column-net hypergraph model. For this
framework, we also propose two methods for effective ordering of individual
SpMxV operations. The primary objective in all of the three methods is to
maximize the exploitation of temporal locality. We evaluate the validity of our
models and methods on a wide range of sparse matrices using both cache-miss
simulations and actual runs by using OSKI. Experimental results show that
proposed methods and models outperform state-of-the-art schemes.

the recently proposed citation impact indicators I3(6PR) and R(6,k) behave
inconsistently when additional papers or citations are taken into
consideration. Three simple examples are presented, in which the indicators
fluctuate strongly and the ranking of scientists in the evaluated group is
sometimes completely mixed up by minor changes in the data base. The erratic
behavior is traced to the specific way in which weights are attributed to the
six percentile rank classes, specifically for the tied papers. For 100
percentile rank classes the effects will be less serious. For the 6 classes it
is demonstrated that a different way of assigning weights avoids these
problems, although the non-linearity of the weights for the different
percentile rank classes can still lead to (much less frequent) changes in the
ranking. This behavior is not undesired, because it can be used to correct for
differences in citation behavior in different fields. Remaining deviations from
the theoretical value R(6,k) = 1.91 can be avoided by a new scoring rule, the
fractional scoring. Previously proposed consistency criteria are amended by
another property of strict independence which a performance indicator should
aim at.

as a simplified tool to study synchronisation in a fluid at low Reynolds

hydrodynamic interactions on the slow dynamics of two oscillators and show that
they can lead to synchronisation. Furthermore, we find that synchronisation is
strongly enhanced when the oscillators are non-isochronous, which on the limit
cycle means the oscillations have an amplitude-dependent frequency.
Non-isochronity is determined by a nonlinear coupling $\alpha$ being non-zero.
We find that its ($\alpha$) sign determines if they synchronise in- or
anti-phase. We then study an infinite array of oscillators in the long
wavelength limit, in presence of noise. For $\alpha > 0$, hydrodynamic
interactions can lead to a homogeneous synchronised state. Numerical
simulations for a finite number of oscillators confirm this and, when $\alpha
<0$, show the propagation of waves, reminiscent of metachronal coordination.

discovery in 1995. These experiments unveil the elementary mechanisms coupling
the electrons' temperature to their spin order. Even though first quantitative
models describing ultrafast demagnetization have just been published within the
past year, new calculations also suggest alternative mechanisms.
Simultaneously, the application of fast demagnetization experiments has been
demonstrated to provide key insight into technologically important systems such
as high spin polarization metals, and consequently there is broad interest in
further understanding the physics of these phenomena. To gain new and relevant
insights, we perform ultrafast optical pump-probe experiments to characterize
the demagnetization processes of highly spin-polarized magnetic thin films on a
femtosecond time scale. Previous studies have suggested shifting the Fermi
energy into the center of the gap by tuning the number of electrons and thereby
to study its influence on spin-flip processes. Here we show that choosing
isoelectronic Heusler compounds (Co2MnSi, Co2MnGe and Co2FeAl) allows us to
vary the degree of spin polarization between 60% and 86%. We explain this
behavior by considering the robustness of the gap against structural disorder.
Moreover, we observe that Co-Fe-based pseudo gap materials, such as partially
ordered Co-Fe-Ge alloys and also the well-known Co-Fe-B alloys, can reach
similar values of the spin polarization. By using the unique features of these
metals we vary the number of possible spin-flip channels, which allows us to
pinpoint and control the half metals electronic structure and its influence
onto the elementary mechanisms of ultrafast demagnetization.

optical modules that detect Cherenkov light induced by charged secondary
particles (typically muons) coming from neutrino interactions. As these lines
are flexible structures fixed to the sea bed and held taut by a buoy, sea
currents cause the lines to move and the storeys to rotate. The knowledge of
the position of the optical modules with a precision better than 10cm is
essential for a good reconstruction of particle tracks. In this paper the
ANTARES positioning system is described. It consists of an acoustic positioning
system, for distance triangulation, and a compass-tiltmeter system, for the
measurement of the orientation and inclination of the storeys. Necessary
corrections are discussed and the results of the detector alignment procedure
are described.

stylized facts observed in the statistics of microstructure returns, including
the short-ranged correlation of returns, the long-ranged correlations of

microstructure noise effect, volatility is a decreasing function of the time
scale used to estimate it. Paradoxically, the Epps effect states that cross
correlations between asset returns are increasing functions of the time scale
at which the returns are estimated. The microstructure noise is explained as
the result of the negative return correlations inherent in the definition of
the bid-ask bounce component (ii). In the presence of a genuine correlation
between the returns of two assets, the Epps effect is due to an average

so-called isoscalar spin-aligned $np$ pair mode. Shell model calculations
reveal that the ground and low-lying yrast states of the $N = Z$ nuclei
$^{92}$Pd and $^{96}$Cd may mainly be built upon such spin-aligned $np$ pairs
each carrying the maximum angular momentum $J = 9$ allowed by the shell
$0g_{9/2}$ which is dominant in this nuclear region.

and anticommuting variables has been introduced recently. The construction
relies on certain orthogonality and triangularity relations. Although many
superpolynomials were constructed as solutions of highly over-determined
system, the existence issue was left open. This is resolved here: we
demonstrate that the underlying construction has a (unique) solution. The proof
uses, as a starting point, the definition of the Macdonald superpolynomials in
terms of the Macdonald non-symmetric polynomials via a non-standard
(anti)symmetrization and a suitable dressing by anticommuting monomials. This
relationship naturally suggests the form of two family of commuting operators
that have the defined superpolynomials as their common eigenfunctions. These
eigenfunctions are then shown to be triangular and orthogonal. Up to a
normalization, these two conditions uniquely characterize these
superpolynomials. Moreover, the Macdonald superpolynomials are found to be
orthogonal with respect to a second (constant-term-type) scalar product and its
norm is evaluated. The latter is shown to match (up to a q-power) the
conjectured norm with respect to the original scalar product. Finally, we
recall the super-version of the Macdonald positivity conjecture and present two
new conjectures which both provide a remarkable relationship between the new
(q,t)-Kostka coefficients and the usual ones.

Can we measure an evolution of the

Motivated by these questions, we revisit a suggestion published recently and
debated in the ""New Scientist"" that the historical distribution of
time-to-proof's, i.e., of waiting times between formulation of a mathematical
conjecture and its proof, can be quantified and gives meaningful insights in
the future development of still open conjectures. We find however evidence that
the mathematical process of creation is too much non-stationary, with too
little data and constraints, to allow for a meaningful conclusion. In
particular, the approximate unsteady exponential growth of human population,
and arguably that of mathematicians, essentially hides the true distribution.
Another issue is the incompleteness of the dataset available. In conclusion we
cannot really reject the simplest model of an exponential rate of conjecture
proof with a rate of 0.01/year for the dataset that we have studied,
translating into an average waiting time to proof of 100 years. We hope that
the presented methodology, combining the mathematics of recurrent processes,
linking proved and still open conjectures, with different empirical
constraints, will be useful for other similar investigations probing the
productivity associated with mankind growth and creativity.

unpredictable process. We establish a formula of integration by parts, the
existence of a continuous modification and give an expression of the increasing
process.

old unsolved problems in relativistic kinetic theory and in relativistic
statistical mechanics. In particular a definition of the relativistic
micro-canonical partition function is given strictly in terms of the Poincar\'e
generators of an interacting N-particle system both in the inertial and
non-inertial rest frames. The non-relativistic limit allows a definition of
both the inertial and non-inertial micro-canonical ensemble strictly in terms
of the Galilei generators. Also the one-particle relativistic distribution
function is defined and a new approach to the relativistic Boltzmann equation
is delineated. Finally there are some comments on relativistic dissipative
fluids.
