lensing tomography can be harnessed to constrain the three-dimensional (3D)
matter power spectrum over a range of redshift and physical scale. By combining
galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering, this can be extended to probe the
3D galaxy-matter and galaxy-galaxy power spectrum or, alternatively, galaxy
biasing parameters. To achieve this aim, this paper introduces and discusses
minimum variance estimators and a more general Bayesian approach to
statistically invert a set of noisy tomography 2-point correlation functions,
measured within a confined opening angle. Both methods are constructed such
that they probe deviations of the power spectrum from a fiducial power
spectrum, thereby enabling both a direct comparison of theory and data, and in
principle the identification of the physical scale and redshift of deviations.
By devising a new Monte Carlo technique, we quantify the measurement noise in
the correlators for a fiducial survey, and test the performance of the
inversion techniques. We conclude that a shear tomography analysis of near
future weak lensing surveys promises fruitful insights into the effect of
baryons on the nonlinear matter power spectrum at z<~0.3 around k~2 h/Mpc, and
into galaxy biasing (z<~0.5). However, a proper treatment of anticipated
systematics -- not included in the mock analysis but discussed here -- is
likely to reduce the signal-to-noise in the analysis so that a robust
assessment of the 3D matter power spectrum probably asks for a survey area of
at least 1000 sdeg. [Abridged]

in a two qubit system. If the 2 \times 2 unitary matrix is special unitary (has
unit determinant), the controlled-unitary gate operation can be realized in a
single pulse operation. The pulse, in our scheme, will constitute varying one
of the parameters of the system between an arbitrarily maximum and a
""calculated"" minimum value. This parameter will constitute the variable
parameter of the system while the other parameters, which include the coupling
between the two qubits, will be treated as fixed parameters. The values of the
parameters are what we solve for using our approach in order to realize an
arbitrary controlled-unitary operation. We further show that the computational
complexity of the operation is no greater than that required for a
Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. Since conventional schemes realize a
controlled-unitary operation by breaking it into a sequence of single-qubit and
CNOT gate operations, our method is an improvement because we not only require
lesser time duration, but also fewer control lines, to implement the same
operation. To demonstrate improvement over other schemes, we show, as examples,
how two controlled-unitary operations, one being the controlled-Hadamard gate,
can be realized in a single pulse operation using our scheme. Furthermore, our
method can be applied to a wide range of coupling schemes and can be used to
realize gate operations between two qubits coupled via Ising, Heisenberg and
anisotropic interactions.

hyperfine states of $^{87}$Rb condensates, we show that there are two
experimentally relevant stationary state configurations: the one in which the
components form a dark-bright symbiotic pair (the ground state of the system),
and the one in which the components are segregated (first excited state). For
each of these two configurations, we show numerically that far from resonances
the Faraday waves excited in the two components are of similar periods, emerge
simultaneously, and do not impact the dynamics of the bulk of the condensate.
We derive analytically the period of the Faraday waves using a variational
treatment of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations combined with a
Mathieu-type analysis for the selection mechanism of the excited waves.
Finally, we show that for a modulation frequency close to twice that of the
radial trapping, the emergent surface waves fade out in favor of a forceful
collective mode that turns the two condensate components miscible.

formation of a double-shock structure with observed signatures from radio to
X-rays. We study the structure and stability of the colliding wind region as it
turns into a spiral due to orbital motion. We focus on adiabatic winds, where
mixing between the two winds is expected to be restricted to the
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI). Mixing of the Wolf-Rayet wind with
hydrogen-rich material is important for dust formation in pinwheel nebulae such
as WR 104, where the spiral structure has been resolved in infrared. We use the
hydrodynamical code RAMSES with an adaptive grid. A wide range of binary
systems with different wind velocities and mass loss rates are studied with 2D
simulations. A specific 3D simulation is performed to model WR 104. Orbital
motion leads to the formation of two distinct spiral arms where the KHI
develops differently. We find that the spiral structure is destroyed when there
is a large velocity gradient between the winds, unless the collimated wind is
much faster. We argue that the KHI plays a major role in maintaining or not the
structure. We discuss the consequences for various colliding wind binaries.
When stable, there is no straightforward relationship between the spatial step
of the spiral, the wind velocities, and the orbital period. Our 3D simulation
of WR 104 indicates that the colder, well-mixed trailing arm has more
favourable conditions for dust formation than the leading arm. The single-arm
infrared spiral follows more closely the mixing map than the density map,
suggesting the dust-to-gas ratio may vary between the leading and trailing
density spirals. However, the density is much lower than what dust formation
models require. Including radiative cooling would lead to higher densities, and
also to thin shell instabilities whose impact on the large structure remains
unknown.

along RG flows. A sufficient condition required for this monotonic flow is that
the stress tensor of the matter fields driving the holographic RG flow must
satisfy the null energy condition over the holographic surface used to
calculate the entanglement entropy. In the case where the bulk theory is
described by Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the latter condition alone is not sufficient
to establish the monotonic flow of the c-function. We also observe that for
certain holographic RG flows, the entanglement entropy undergoes a 'phase

The filaments are first detected on Meudon Spectroheliograph H{\alpha} images

(Solar phys. 227, 61, 2005). This technique combines cleaning processes, image
segmentation based on region growing, and morphological parameter ex- traction,
including the determination of filament skeletons. The coordinates of the
skeleton pixels, given in a heliocentric system, are then converted to a more
appropriate reference frame that follows the rotation of the Sun surface. In
such a frame, a co-rotating filament is always located around the same
position, and its skeletons (extracted from each image) are thus spatially
close, forming a group of adjacent features. In a third step, the shape of each
skeleton is compared with its neighbours using a curve-matching algorithm. This
step will permit us to define the probability [P ] that two close filaments in
the co-rotating frame are actually the same one observed on two different
images. At the end, the pairs of features, for which the corresponding
probability is greater than a threshold value, are associated using tracking
identification indexes.On a representative sample of filaments, the good
agreement between automated and manual tracking confirms the reliability of the
technique to be applied on large data sets. Especially, this code is already
used in the framework of the Heliophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) to
populate a catalogue dedicated to solar and heliospheric features (HFC). An
extension of this method to others filament observations, and possibly the

sought-after goal with important applications in deep tissue imaging. Although
being the focus of numerous works, this goal was considered impractical until
recently. Adaptive-optics techniques which are effective in correcting weak
wavefront aberrations, were deemed inadequate for turbid samples, where complex
speckle patterns arise and light is scattered to a large number of modes that
greatly exceeds the number of degrees of control. This conception changed after
the demonstration of focusing coherent light through turbid media by
wavefront-shaping, using a spatial-light-modulator (SLM). Here we show that
wavefront-shaping enables widefield real-time imaging through scattering media
with both coherent or incoherent illumination, in transmission and reflection.
In contrast to the recently introduced schemes for imaging through turbid
media, our technique does not require coherent sources, interferometric
detection, raster scanning, or off-line image reconstruction. Our results bring
wavefront-shaping closer to practical applications, and realize the vision of
looking 'through walls' and 'around corners'.

In this problem, given a graph G=(V,E) representing clients in a broadcast
network, each of which initially hold a (not necessarily disjoint) set of
information packets; one wishes to design a communication scheme in which
eventually all clients will hold all the packets of the network. Communication
is performed in rounds, where in each round a single client broadcasts a single
(possibly encoded) information packet to its neighbors in G. The objective is
to design a broadcast scheme that satisfies all clients with the minimum number
of broadcast rounds.
  The coded cooperative data exchange problem has seen significant research
over the last few years; mostly when the graph G is the complete broadcast
graph in which each client is adjacent to all other clients in the network, but
also on general topologies, both in the fractional and integral setting. In
this work we focus on the integral setting in general undirected topologies G.
We tie the data exchange problem on G to certain well studied combinatorial
properties of G and in such show that solving the problem exactly or even
approximately within a multiplicative factor of \log{|V|} is intractable (i.e.,
NP-Hard). We then turn to study efficient data exchange schemes yielding a
number of communication rounds comparable to our intractability result. Our
communication schemes do not involve encoding, and in such yield bounds on the
""coding advantage"" in the setting at hand.

service rate and global Poisson arrival rate $N \lambda$. Upon arrival each
customer chooses a number of queues to be sampled uniformly at random and joins
the least loaded sampled queue. Customers are assumed to have cost for both
waiting and sampling, and they want to minimize their own expected total cost.
  We study the supermarket game in a mean field model that corresponds to the
limit as $N$ converges to infinity in the sense that (i) for a fixed symmetric
customer strategy, the joint equilibrium distribution of any fixed number of
queues converges as $N \to \infty$ to a product distribution determined by the
mean field model and (ii) a Nash equilibrium for the mean field model is an
$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the finite $N$ model with $N$ sufficiently
large. It is shown that there always exists a Nash equilibrium for $\lambda <1$
and the Nash equilibrium is unique with homogeneous waiting cost for $\lambda^2

customers has a positive externality on the other customers in the mean field

adjacent miniijets can be as much as from single jets for meson production, and
even more so for proton, but never dominant over other components. In
3-shower-parton recombination the ratio of 2-jet to 1-jet contributions

motivated by discovery processes in large-scale distributed networks like
peer-to-peer or social networks.
  A well-studied problem in peer-to-peer networks is the resource discovery
problem. There, the goal for nodes (hosts with IP addresses) is to discover the
IP addresses of all other hosts. In social networks, nodes (people) discover
new nodes through exchanging contacts with their neighbors (friends). In both
cases the discovery of new nodes changes the underlying network - new edges are
added to the network - and the process continues in the changed network.
Rigorously analyzing such dynamic (stochastic) processes with a continuously
self-changing topology remains a challenging problem with obvious applications.
  This paper studies and analyzes two natural gossip-based discovery processes.
In the push process, each node repeatedly chooses two random neighbors and puts
them in contact (i.e., ""pushes"" their mutual information to each other). In the
pull discovery process, each node repeatedly requests or ""pulls"" a random
contact from a random neighbor. Both processes are lightweight, local, and
naturally robust due to their randomization.
  Our main result is an almost-tight analysis of the time taken for these two
randomized processes to converge. We show that in any undirected n-node graph
both processes take O(n log^2 n) rounds to connect every node to all other
nodes with high probability, whereas Omega(n log n) is a lower bound. In the
directed case we give an O(n^2 log n) upper bound and an Omega(n^2) lower bound
for strongly connected directed graphs. A key technical challenge that we
overcome is the analysis of a randomized process that itself results in a
constantly changing network which leads to complicated dependencies in every
round.

inversely on the writing speed, hence forming a regular array of oriented grain

systematically study the role of large-angle grain boundaries in carrier
transport and charge trapping in thin film transistors. The effective mobility
scales with the grain size, leading to an estimate of the potential drop at
individual large-angle grain boundaries of more than one volt. This result
indicates that the structure of grain boundaries is not molecularly abrupt,
which may be a general feature of solution processed small molecule organic
semiconductor thin films where relatively high energy grain boundaries are
typically formed. This may be due to the crystal Transient measurements after
switching from positive to negative gate bias or between large and small

order of 10 s, and trap densities that are correlated with grain boundary
density. We suggest that charge diffusion along grain boundaries and other

game-theoretic scenario in which competing advertisers want to target initial
adopters in a social network. Each advertiser wishes to maximize the resulting
cascade of influence, modeled by a general network diffusion process. However,
competition between products may adversely impact the rate of adoption for any
given firm. The resulting framework gives rise to complex preferences that
depend on the specifics of the stochastic diffusion model and the network
topology.
  We study this model from the perspective of a central mechanism, such as a
social networking platform, that can optimize seed placement as a service for
the advertisers. We ask: given the reported demands of the competing firms, how
should a mechanism choose seeds to maximize overall efficiency? Beyond the
algorithmic problem, competition raises issues of strategic behaviour: rational
agents should not be incentivized to underreport their budget demands.
  We show that when there are two players, the social welfare can be
$2$-approximated by a polynomial-time strategyproof mechanism. Our mechanism is
defined recursively, randomizing the order in which advertisers are allocated
seeds according to a particular greedy method. For three or more players, we
demonstrate that under additional assumptions (satisfied by many existing
models of influence spread) there exists a simpler strategyproof
$\frac{e}{e-1}$-approximation mechanism; notably, this second mechanism is not
necessarily strategyproof when there are only two players.

On the basis of one-loop scattering amplitudes for the quasi-one-dimensional
electron gas, the integration of the renormalization group equations for the
two-loop single particle Matsubara self-energy leads to a nonFermi-liquid
temperature downturn of the momentum-resolved quasi-particle weight over most
part of the Fermi surface. The amplitude of the downturn correlates with the
entire instability line for superconductivity, defining an extended quantum
critical region of the phase diagram as a function of nesting deviations of the
Fermi surface. One also extracts the downward renormalization of interchain
hopping amplitudes at arbitrary low temperature in the normal phase. By means
of analytical continuation of the Matsubara self-energy, one-particle spectral
functions are obtained with respect to both energy and temperature and their
anomalous features analyzed in connection with the sequence of instability
lines of the phase diagram. The quasi-particle scattering rate is found to
develop an unusual temperature dependence, which is best described by the
superimposition of a linear and quadratic $T$ dependences. The nonFermi-liquid
linear-$T$ component correlates with the temperature scale $T_c$ of the
superconducting instability over an extended range of nesting deviations,
whereas its anisotropy along the Fermi surface is predicted to parallel the
momentum profile of a d-wave pairing gap on the Fermi surface. We examine the
implications of our results for low dimensional unconventional superconductors,
in particular the Bechgaard salts series of quasi-1D organic conductors, but
also the pnictide and cuprate superconductors where several common features are

13 to 100 kpc and thus reside in rather remote environments. Ten of the
clusters are classical globulars, while four are from the Huxor et al. (2005,
2008) population of extended, old clusters. For most clusters, contamination by
M31 halo stars is slight, and so the profiles can be mapped reliably to large
radial distances from their centres. We find that the extended clusters are
well fit by analytic King (1962) profiles with ~20 parsec core radii and ~100
parsec photometric tidal radii, or by Sersic profiles of index ~1 (i.e.
approximately exponential). Most of the classical globulars also have large
photometric tidal radii in the range 50-100 parsec, however the King profile is
a less good fit in some cases, particularly at small radii. We find 60% of the
classical globular clusters exhibit cuspy cores which are reasonably well
described by Sersic profiles of index ~2-6. Our analysis also reinforces the
finding that luminous classical globulars, with half-light radii <10 parsec,
are present out to radii of at least 100 kpc in M31, which is in contrast to
the situation in the Milky Way where such clusters (other than the unusual
object NGC 2419) are absent beyond 40 kpc.

show that irrespective of the order of the function, nonlocality leads to the
following properties for black hole spacetimes: i) horizon extremization also
in the neutral, non rotating case; ii) black hole phase transition from a
Schwarzschild phase to a positive heat capacity cooling down phase; iii) zero
temperature remnant formation at the end of the evaporation process; iv)
negligible quantum back reaction due to the presence of an upper bound for the

and the gauge fields are not frame-invariant in order to define a `QCD-frame',
where the scalar is not coupled to the gluons. We show that this frame is a
natural generalization of the `Jordan frame' in the case of non-metric theories
and that it is particularly convenient for gravitational phenomenology: test
bodies have trajectories that are as close as possible to geodesics with
respect to such a metric and equivalence principle violations are directly
proportional to the scalar coupling parameters written in this frame. We show
how RG flow and decoupling work in metric and non-metric theories. RG-running
commutes with the operation of switching between frames at different scales.
When only matter loops are considered, our analysis confirms that metricity is
stable under radiative corrections and shows that approximate metricity is
natural in a technical sense.

the levitation and pair annihilation effect, indicating that the delocalized

Secondly, the Z2 invariant is computed via twisted boundary conditions using an

quantized and non-fluctuating even after the spectral gap becomes filled with

stochastically-sampled, initial mass function (IMF) is preferred over the
truncated IMF, because there are low mass stellar clusters (10^{2-3}Msun) that
host massive O-type stars; that (2) the standard Salpeter IMF and a simple
aging effect explain the counts of FUV-bright and Halpha-bright clusters with
masses >10^3Msun; and that (3) the Halpha to FUV flux ratio over the XUV disk
supports the standard IMF. The Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam) covers a
large area even outside the XUV disk -- far beyond the detection limit of the

lines on an accelerated contact discontinuity in a weakly collisional plasma.
We first perform a linear stability analysis similar to that used to derive the
Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) dispersion relation. We find that anisotropic
conduction is only important for compressible modes, as incompressible modes
are isothermal. Modes grow faster in the presence of anisotropic conduction,
but growth rates do not change by more than a factor of order unity. We next
run fully non-linear numerical simulations of a contact discontinuity with
anisotropic conduction. The non-linear evolution can be thought of as a
superposition of three physical effects: temperature diffusion due to vertical
conduction, the RTI, and the heat flux driven buoyancy instability (HBI). In
simulations with RTI-stable contact discontinuities, the temperature
discontinuity spreads due to vertical heat conduction. This occurs even for
initially horizontal magnetic fields due to the initial vertical velocity
perturbation and numerical mixing across the interface. The HBI slows this
temperature diffusion by reorienting initially vertical magnetic field lines to
a more horizontal geometry. In simulations with RTI-unstable contact
discontinuities, the dynamics are initially governed by temperature diffusion,
but the RTI becomes increasingly important at late times. We discuss the
possible application of these results to supernova remnants, solar prominences,
and cold fronts in galaxy clusters.

most extensively observed source of a small group of nearby, thermally emitting
isolated neutron stars, of which at least one member (RX J0720.4-3125, Hohle et
al., 2010) has shown long term variability. A detailed analysis of the data
obtained with the EPIC-pn camera in the 0.15-1.2 keV energy range reveals small
variations in the temperature derived with a single blackbody fit (of the order
of 1% around kT^inf \sim 61 eV). Such variations are correlated with the
position of the source on the detector and can be ascribed to an instrumental
effect, most likely a spatial dependence of the channel to energy relation. For
the sampled instrumental coordinates, we quantify this effect as variations of
\sim 4% and \sim 15 eV in the gain slope and offset, respectively. Selecting
only a homogeneous subset of observations, with the source imaged at the same
detector position, we find no evidence for spectral or flux variations of RX
J1856.5-3754 from March 2005 to present-day, with limits of Delta kT^inf < 0.5%
and Delta f_X < 3% (0.15-1.2 keV), with 3sigma confidence. A slightly higher
temperature (kT^inf \sim 61.5 eV, compared to kT^\inf \sim 61 eV) was instead
measured in April 2002. If this difference is not of instrumental origin, it
implies a rate of variation \sim -0.15 eV yr^-1 between April 2002 and March
2005. The high-statistics spectrum from the selected observations is best
fitted with the sum of two blackbody models, with temperatures kT_h^inf =
62.4_{-0.4}^{+0.6} eV and kT_s^\inf = 38.9_{-2.9}^{+4.9} eV, which account for

flows, the excursion-set formalism can be used to calculate the statistics of
self-gravitating objects over a wide range of scales. On the largest
self-gravitating scales ('first crossing'), these correspond to GMCs, and on
the smallest non-fragmenting self-gravitating scales ('last crossing'), to
protostellar cores. Here, we extend this formalism to rigorously calculate the
auto and cross-correlation functions of cores (and by extension, young stars)
as a function of spatial separation and mass, in analogy to the cosmological
calculation of halo clustering. We show that this generically predicts that
star formation is very strongly clustered on small scales: stars form in
clusters, themselves inside GMCs. Outside the binary-star regime, the projected
correlation function declines as a weak power-law, until a characteristic scale
which corresponds to the characteristic mass scale of GMCs. On much larger
scales the clustering declines such that star formation is not strongly biased
on galactic scales, relative to the actual dense gas distribution. The precise
correlation function shape depends on properties of the turbulent spectrum, but
its qualitative behavior is quite general. The predictions agree well with
observations of young star and core autocorrelation functions over ~4 dex in
radius. Clustered star formation is a generic consequence of supersonic
turbulence if most of the power in the velocity field, hence the contribution
to density fluctuations, comes from large scales. The distribution of
self-gravitating masses near the sonic length is then imprinted by fluctuations
on larger scales. We similarly show that the fraction of stars formed in
'isolated' modes should be small (\lesssim10%).

detected by MAGIC in the Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasar PKS 1222+216. The minimum
distance from the jet origin at which this flare could be produced is 0.5 pc. A
moderate Doppler factor of the VHE source, D_{VHE} ~ 20, is allowed by all
opacity constraints. The concurrent High-Energy (HE) emission observed by Fermi
provides estimates of the total jet power and the jet magnetic field strength.
Energetic constraints for the VHE flare are extremely tight: for an isotropic
particle distribution they require a huge co-moving energy density in the
emitting region and a very efficient radiative process. We disfavor hadronic
processes due to their low radiative efficiency, as well as the synchrotron
scenario recently proposed for the case of HE flares in the Crab Nebula, since
the parameters needed to overcome the radiative losses are quite extreme. The
VHE emission can be explained by the Synchrotron Self-Compton (SSC) mechanism
for D_{VHE} ~ 20 or by the External Radiation Compton (ERC) mechanism involving
the infrared radiation of the dusty torus for D_{VHE} ~ 50. After discussing
several alternative scenarios, we propose that the extreme energy density
constraint can be satisfied when the emission comes from highly anisotropic
short-lived bunches of particles formed by the kinetic beaming mechanism in
magnetic reconnection sites. By focusing the emitting particles into very
narrow beams, this mechanism allows one to relax the causality constraint on
the source size, decreasing the required energy density by 4 orders of
magnitude.

stars on so-called centrophilic orbits that interact with the binary and thus
avoid the FPP. In this paper, using a set of direct N-body simulations of
mergers of initially spherically symmetric galaxies with different mass ratios,
we show that the merger-induced triaxiality is able to drive unequal-mass SMBH
binaries to coalescence. The binary hardening rates are high and depend only
weakly on the mass ratios of SMBHs for a wide range of mass ratios q. The
hardening rates are significantly higher for galaxies having steep cusps in
comparison with those having shallow cups at centers. The evolution of the
binary SMBH leads to relatively shallower inner slopes at the centers of the
merger remnants. The stellar mass displaced by the SMBH binary on its way to
coalescence is ~ 1-5 times the combined mass of binary SMBHs. The coalescence
times for SMBH binary with mass ~ million solar masses are less than 1 Gyr and
for those at the upper end of SMBH masses (~ billion solar masses) are 1-2 Gyr
for less eccentric binaries whereas less than 1 Gyr for highly eccentric
binaries. SMBH binaries are thus expected to be promising sources of
gravitational waves at low and high redshifts.

the depth and resolution of the COSMOS HST images, we detect satellites up to
eight magnitudes fainter than the host galaxies and as close as 0.3 (1.4)
arcseconds (kpc). Describing the number density profile of satellite galaxies
to be a projected power law such that $P(R)\propto R^{\rpower}$, we find
$\rpower=-1.1\pm 0.3$. We find no dependency of $\rpower$ on host stellar mass,
redshift, morphology or satellite luminosity. Satellites of early-type hosts
have angular distributions that are more flattened than the host light profile
and are aligned with its major axis. No significant average alignment is
detected for satellites of late-type hosts. The number of satellites within a
fixed magnitude contrast from a host galaxy is dependent on its stellar mass,
with more massive galaxies hosting significantly more satellites. Furthermore,
high-mass late-type hosts have significantly fewer satellites than early-type
galaxies of the same stellar mass, likely a result of environmental
differences. No significant evolution in the number of satellites per host is
detected. The cumulative luminosity function of satellites is qualitatively in
good agreement with that predicted using subhalo abundance matching techniques.
However, there are significant residual discrepancies in the absolute
normalization, suggesting that properties other than the host galaxy luminosity
or stellar mass determine the number of satellites.

discovered to exhibit comet-like activity by the Pan-STARRS1 survey telescope
using automated point-spread-function analyses performed by PS1's Moving Object

antisolar dust tail and a longer (\sim 60"") dust trail aligned with the
object's orbit plane, similar to the morphology observed for another main-belt
comet, P/2010 R2 (La Sagra), and other well-established comets, implying the
action of a long-lived, sublimation-driven emission event. Photometry showing
the brightness of the near-nucleus coma remaining constant over \sim 30 days
provides further evidence for this object's cometary nature, suggesting it is
in fact a main-belt comet, and not a disrupted asteroid. A spectroscopic search
for CN emission was unsuccessful, though we find an upper limit CN production
rate of Q_CN < 1.3x10^24 mol/s, from which we infer a water production rate of
Q_H2O < 10^26 mol/s. We also find an approximately linear optical spectral
slope of 7.2%/1000A, similar to other cometary dust comae. Numerical
simulations indicate that P/2006 VW139 is dynamically stable for > 100 Myr,
while a search for a potential asteroid family around the object reveals a
cluster of 24 asteroids within a cutoff distance of 68 m/s. At 70 m/s, this

good proxies for SN colour. We also employ a combination of light-curve
parameters (specifically the SALT2 stretch and colour parameters x_1 and c,
respectively) and spectral measurements to calculate distance moduli. The
residuals from these models are then compared to the standard model which uses
only light-curve stretch and colour. Our investigations show that a distance
model that uses x_1, c, and the velocity of the Si II 6355 feature does not
lead to a decrease in the Hubble residuals. We also find that distance models
with flux ratios alone or in conjunction with light-curve information rarely
perform better than the standard (x_1,c) model. However, when adopting a
distance model which combines the ratio of fluxes near ~3750 Ang. and ~4550
Ang. with both x_1 and c, the Hubble residuals are decreased by ~10 per cent,
which is found to be significant at about the 2-sigma level. The weighted
root-mean-square of the residuals using this model is 0.130 +/- 0.017 mag (as
compared with 0.144 +/- 0.019 mag when using the same sample with the standard

experiments that require extremely low levels of radioactive backgrounds such
as direct dark matter searches and neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments.
Unmeasured neutron scattering cross sections are often accounted for
incorrectly in Monte Carlo simulations. Purpose: Determine partial gamma-ray
production cross sections for (n,xng) reactions in natural argon for incident
neutron energies between 1 and 30 MeV. Methods: The broad spectrum neutron beam
at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) was used used for the
measurement. Neutron energies were determined using time-of-flight and
resulting gamma rays from neutron-induced reactions were detected using the
GErmanium Array for Neutron Induced Excitations (GEANIE). Results: Partial
gamma-ray cross sections were measured for six excited states in Ar-40 and two
excited states in Ar-39. Measured (n,xng) cross sections were compared to the
TALYS and CoH3 nuclear reaction codes. Conclusions: These new measurements will
help to identify potential backgrounds in neutrinoless double-beta decay and
dark matter experiments that use argon as a detection medium or shielding. The
measurements will also aid in the identification of neutron interactions in
these experiments through the detection of gamma rays produced by (n,xng)
reactions.

considers degenerate particles with non-zero total momentum. We focus on the

The reliable extraction of S-wave phase shift is much more challenging since
delta(l=0) is always accompanied by delta(l=1) in the phase shift relations,

the reciprocal character of their synapses with the principal mitral cells --
are sufficient to restructure the network and to alter its encoding of odor

respect to various types of perturbations of the reciprocity. The model
parsimoniously captures the experimentally observed role of neurogenesis in

galactic nuclei. These lines allowed to discover the cosmological nature of
quasars, and at present these lines allow for convenient method of weighting
the black holes residing in their nuclei. However, a question remains why such
strong lines form there in the first place. Specifically, in the case of Low
Ionization Lines, there must be a mechanism which leads to an efficient rise of
the material from the surface of the accretion disk surrounding a black hole
but at the same time should not give a strong signature of the systematic
outflow, as the Balmer lines are not significantly shifted with respect to the
Narrow Line Region. We determine the effective temperature of the accretion
disk underlying the H$\beta$ line at the basis of the time delay measured from
reverberation and the simple Shakura-Sunyaev theory of accretion disks. We
obtain that this temperature is universal, and equal $995 \pm 74$ K,
independently from the black hole mass and accretion rate of the source. This
result suggests to us that the dust formation in the disk atmosphere is
responsible for the strong rise of the material. However, as the material gains
height above the disk it becomes irradiated, the dust evaporates, the radiation
pressure force suddently drops and the material fall back again at the disk.
Therefore, a failed wind forms. In the simple version of the model the disk
irradiation is neglected, but in the present paper we also discuss this
irradiation and we use the observed variation of the Broad Line Region in NGC
5548 to constrain the character of this non-local non-stationary phenomenon.
The current instruments cannot resolve the Broad Line Region but future
instrumentation may allow to test the model directly.

physically meaningful evidence (e.g., the holographic principle) has
accumulated that the BG entropy $S_{BG}$ of a $(3+1)$ black hole is
proportional to its area $L^2$ ($L$ being a characteristic linear length), and
not to its volume $L^3$. Similarly it exists the \emph{area law}, so named
because, for a wide class of strongly quantum-entangled $d$-dimensional
systems, $S_{BG}$ is proportional to $\ln L$ if $d=1$, and to $L^{d-1}$ if
$d>1$, instead of being proportional to $L^d$ ($d \ge 1$). These results
violate the extensivity of the thermodynamical entropy of a $d$-dimensional
system. This thermodynamical inconsistency disappears if we realize that the
thermodynamical entropy of such nonstandard systems is \emph{not} to be
identified with the BG {\it additive} entropy but with appropriately
generalized {\it nonadditive} entropies. Indeed, the celebrated usefulness of
the BG entropy is founded on hypothesis such as relatively weak probabilistic
correlations (and their connections to ergodicity, which by no means can be
assumed as a general rule of nature). Here we introduce a generalized entropy
which, for the Schwarzschild black hole and the area law, can solve the

designed and conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of
visual features for CTR prediction, ranking and performance classification.
Based on the evaluation results, we selected a subset of features that have the
most important impact on CTR. We believe that the findings presented in this
paper will be very useful for the online advertising industry in designing
high-performance creatives. It also provides the research community with the
first ever data set, initial insights into visual appearance's effect on user
response propensity, and evaluation benchmarks for further study.

inversion (PEXSI) technique to Kohn-Sham density function theory (DFT)
electronic structure calculations that are based on atomic orbital
discretization. We give analytic expressions for evaluating the charge density,
the total energy, the Helmholtz free energy and the atomic forces (including
both the Hellman-Feynman force and the Pulay force) without using the
eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian. We also show how to
update the chemical potential without using Kohn-Sham eigenvalues. The
advantage of using PEXSI is that it has a much lower computational complexity
than that associated with the matrix diagonalization procedure. We demonstrate
the performance gain by comparing the timing of PEXSI with that of
diagonalization on insulating and metallic nanotubes. For these quasi-1D
systems, the complexity of PEXSI is linear with respect to the number of atoms.
This linear scaling can be observed in our computational experiments when the
number of atoms in a nanotube is larger than a few hundreds. Both the wall
clock time and the memory requirement of PEXSI is modest. This makes it even
possible to perform Kohn-Sham DFT calculations for 10,000-atom nanotubes with a
sequential implementation of the selected inversion algorithm. We also perform
an accurate geometry optimization calculation on a truncated (8,0)
boron-nitride nanotube system containing 1024 atoms. Numerical results indicate
that the use of PEXSI does not lead to loss of accuracy required in a practical
DFT calculation.

  Machine Learning (ICML 2012), Jun 2012, Edinburgh, United Kingdom",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scene parsing, or semantic segmentation, consists in labeling each pixel in
an image with the category of the object it belongs to. It is a challenging
task that involves the simultaneous detection, segmentation and recognition of
all the objects in the image.
  The scene parsing method proposed here starts by computing a tree of segments
from a graph of pixel dissimilarities. Simultaneously, a set of dense feature
vectors is computed which encodes regions of multiple sizes centered on each
pixel. The feature extractor is a multiscale convolutional network trained from
raw pixels. The feature vectors associated with the segments covered by each
node in the tree are aggregated and fed to a classifier which produces an
estimate of the distribution of object categories contained in the segment. A
subset of tree nodes that cover the image are then selected so as to maximize
the average ""purity"" of the class distributions, hence maximizing the overall
likelihood that each segment will contain a single object. The convolutional
network feature extractor is trained end-to-end from raw pixels, alleviating
the need for engineered features. After training, the system is parameter free.
  The system yields record accuracies on the Stanford Background Dataset (8
classes), the Sift Flow Dataset (33 classes) and the Barcelona Dataset (170
classes) while being an order of magnitude faster than competing approaches,
producing a 320 \times 240 image labeling in less than 1 second.

in recent years since they offer tremendous benefits for remote health
monitoring and continuous, real-time patient care. However, as with any
wireless communication, data security in WBANs is a challenging design issue.
Since such networks consist of small sensors placed on the human body, they
impose resource and computational restrictions, thereby making the use of
sophisticated and advanced encryption algorithms infeasible. This calls for the
design of algorithms with a robust key generation / management scheme, which
are reasonably resource optimal. This paper presents a security suite for
WBANs, comprised of IAMKeys, an independent and adaptive key management scheme
for improving the security of WBANs, and KEMESIS, a key management scheme for
security in inter-sensor communication. The novelty of these schemes lies in
the use of a randomly generated key for encrypting each data frame that is
generated independently at both the sender and the receiver, eliminating the
need for any key exchange. The simplicity of the encryption scheme, combined
with the adaptability in key management makes the schemes simple, yet secure.
The proposed algorithms are validated by performance analysis.

highly biased by the limited sensitivity of {\it Swift} to detect SGRBs. We
account for the dominant biases to calculate a realistic SGRB rate density out
to $z\approx0.5$ using the {\it Swift} sample of peak fluxes, redshifts, and
those SGRBs with a beaming angle constraint from X-ray/optical observations. We
find an SGRB lower rate density of $8^{+5}_{-3}$
$\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ (assuming isotropic emission), and a
beaming corrected upper limit of $1100^{+700}_{-470} $
$\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Assuming a significant fraction of binary
neutron star mergers produce SGRBs, we calculate lower and upper detection rate
limits of $(1-180)$ yr$^{-1}$ by an aLIGO and Virgo coincidence search. Our
detection rate is similar to the lower and realistic rates inferred from
extrapolations using Galactic pulsar observations and population synthesis.

only when needed. Hardware-in-the-loop simulations confirm that convergence of

concentrated to a maximally entangled pair with only an ancillary single photon

partially entangled pairs at least. Our first protocol is implemented with
linear optics and the second one is implemented with cross-Kerr nonlinearities.
Compared with other ECPs, they do not need to know the accurate coefficients of
the initial state. With linear optics, it is feasible with current experiment.
With cross-Kerr nonlinearities, it does not require the sophisticated
single-photon detectors and can be repeated to get a higher success
probability. Moreover, the second protocol can get the higher entanglement
transformation efficiency and it maybe the most economical one by far.
Meanwhile, both of protocols are more suitable for multi-photon system
concentration, because they need less operations and classical communications.
All these advantages make two protocols be useful in current long-distance

redshift (z > 3) quasars are presented. The core and jet brightness
temperatures are found through modelling the self-calibrated uv-data with
Gaussian components, which provide reliable estimates of the flux density and
size of individual components. The observed high core brightness temperatures
(median $T_{\rm b,\,core}=4\times10^{11}$ K) are consistent with Doppler
boosted emission from a relativistic jet orientated close to the line-of-sight.
This can also explain the dramatic jet bends observed for some of our sources
since small intrinsic bends can be significantly amplified due to projection
effects in a highly beamed relativistic jet. We also model-fit the polarized
emission and, by taking the minimum angle separation between the model-fitted
polarization angles at 5 and 8.4 GHz, we calculate the minimum inferred Faraday
rotation measure (RM$_{\rm min}$) for each component. We also calculate the
minimum intrinsic RM in the rest frame of the AGN (RM$_{\rm min}^{\rm intr}$ =
RM$_{\rm min} (1+z)^2$), first subtracting the integrated (presumed foreground)
RM in those cases where we felt we could do this reliably. The resulting mean
core $|$RM$_{\rm min}^{\rm intr}|$ is 5580 rad m$^{-2}$, with a standard
deviation of 3390 rad m$^{-2}$, for four high-z quasars for which we believe we
could reliably remove the foreground RM. We find relatively steep core and jet
spectral index values, with a median core spectral index of -0.3 and a median
jet spectral index of -1.0. Comparing our results with RM observations of more
nearby Active Galactic Nuclei at similar emitted frequencies does not provide

Vector Quantization (LVQ) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). This efficiency is
gained with no compromises: accuracy is maintained, while estimates of the

accuracy of an estimate in the absence of its true value, but also to
re-calibrate a retrieved image and as a proxy for a discretized continuum

clusters but conflicting results, ranging from solar values to overabundances
of up to five orders of magnitude, have been found. The reasons for this
disagreement are not well-understood. As these Na overabundances can be the
result of deep mixing, their proper understanding has consequences for models
of stellar evolution. As discussed in the literature, part of this disagreement
comes from the adoption of different corrections for non-LTE effects and from
the use of different atomic data for the same set of lines. However, a clear
picture of the Na behaviour in giants is still missing. To contribute in this
direction, this work presents a careful redetermination of the Na abundances of
the Hyades giants, motivated by the recent measurement of their angular
diameters. An average of [Na/Fe] = +0.30, in NLTE, has been found. This
overabundance can be explained by hydrodynamical models with high initial
rotation velocities. This result, and a trend of increasing Na with increasing
stellar mass found in a previous work, suggests that there is no strong
evidence of Na overabundances in red giants beyond those values expected by
evolutionary models of stars with more than ~ 2 Msun.

$\bar{\psi}\eps\gamma_j\psi B_k$ of the $1^{-+}$ meson on the lattice and
compare them to the corresponding matrix elements of the ordinary mesons to
discern if it is a hybrid. For the charmoniums and strange quarkoniums, we find
that the matrix elements of $1^{-+}$ are comparable in size as compared to
other known $q\bar{q}$ mesons. They are particularly similar to those of the
$2^{++}$ meson, since their dimension-4 operators are in the same Lorentz
multiplet.
  Based on these observations, we find no evidence to support the notion that
the lowest $1^{-+}$ mesons in the $c\bar{c}$ and $s\bar{s}$ regions are
hybrids. As for the exotic quantum number is concerned, the non-relativistic
reduction reveals that the leading terms in the dimension-4 and dimension-5
operators of $1^{-+}$ are identical up to a proportional constant and it
involves a center-of-mass momentum operator of the quark-antiquark pair. This
explains why $1^{-+}$ is an exotic quantum number in the constituent quark
model where the center of mass of the $q\bar{q}$ is not a dynamical degree of
freedom. Since QCD has gluon fields in the context of the flux-tube which is
appropriate for heavy quarkoniums to allow the valence $q\bar{q}$ to recoil
against them, it can accommodate such states as $1^{-+}$. By the same token,
hadronic models with additional constituents besides the quarks can also
accommodate the $q\bar{q}$ center-of-mass motion. To account for the quantum
numbers of these $q\bar{q}$ mesons in QCD and hadron models in the
non-relativistic case, the parity and total angular momentum should be modified
to $P = (-)^{L + l +1}$ and $\vec{J} = \vec{L} + \vec{l} + \vec{S}$, where $L$
is the orbital angular momentum of the $q\bar{q}$ pair in the meson.

strategic game between the agents. The possibility of not choosing any product
results in two special types of (pure) Nash equilibria.
  We show that such games may have no Nash equilibrium and that determining the

situation changes when the underlying graph of the social network is a DAG, a
simple cycle, or has no source nodes. For these three classes we determine the
complexity of establishing whether a (special type of) Nash equilibrium exists.
  We also clarify for these categories of games the status and the complexity
of the finite improvement property (FIP). Further, we introduce a new property
of the uniform FIP which is satisfied when the underlying graph is a simple
cycle, but determining it is co-NP-hard in the general case and also when the
underlying graph has no source nodes. The latter complexity results also hold
for verifying the property of being a weakly acyclic game.

number (Ec). The model we use is an extension of the classical Lorenz-63 model
with 4 kinematic and 6 thermal degrees of freedom. The conservative parts of
the dynamical equations which include all nonlinearities satisfy Liouville's
theorem and permit a conserved Hamiltonian H for arbitrary Ec. For Ec=0 two
independent conserved Casimir functions exist, one of these is associated with
unavailable potential energy and is also present in the Lorenz-63 truncation.
This Casimir C is used to construct a Nambu representation of the conserved
part of the dynamical system. The thermal heating effect can be represented
either by a second canonical Hamiltonian or as a gradient (metric) system using
the time derivative of the Casimir. The results demonstrate the impact of
viscous heating in the total energy budget and in the Lorenz energy cycle for
kinetic and available potential energy.

model of nature than that with orthonomal bases. Studies about the signal
recovery associated with such sparsity models have been one of major focuses in
compressed sensing. In such settings, one important and widely used signal
recovery approach is known as $\ell_1$-synthesis (or Basis Pursuit). We present
in this article a more effective performance analysis (than what are available)
of this approach in which the dictionary $\Dbf$ may be highly, and even
perfectly correlated. Under suitable conditions on the sensing matrix $\Phibf$,
an error bound of the recovered signal $\hat{\fbf}$ (by the $\ell_1$-synthesis
method) is established. Such an error bound is governed by the decaying
property of $\tilde{\Dbf}_{\text{o}}^*\fbf$, where $\fbf$ is the true signal
and $\tilde{\Dbf}_{\text{o}}$ denotes the optimal dual frame of $\Dbf$ in the
sense that $\|\tilde{\Dbf}_{\text{o}}^*\hat{\fbf}\|_1$ produces the smallest
$\|\tilde{\Dbf}^*\tilde{\fbf}\|_1$ in value among all dual frames
$\tilde{\Dbf}$ of $\Dbf$ and all feasible signals $\tilde{\fbf}$. This new
performance analysis departs from the usual description of the combo
$\Phibf\Dbf$, and places the description on $\Phibf$. Examples are demonstrated
to show that when the usual analysis fails to explain the working performance

The theory predicts a fluctuation-dissipation relation known to be satisfied at

an effective temperature defined by the center of mass kinetic energy. To test
the validity of the fluctuation-dissipation relation, we performed extensive
and accurate event-driven molecular dynamics simulations for the model system

Gaussian interference channel (GIC), with the interference treated as Gaussian
noise, is a key problem in wireless communication. However, due to the users'
mutual interference, this problem is in general non-convex and thus cannot be
solved directly by conventional convex optimization techniques. In this paper,
by jointly utilizing the monotonic optimization and rate profile techniques, we
develop a new framework to obtain the globally optimal power control and/or
beamforming solutions to the WSR maximization problems for the GICs with
single-antenna transmitters and single-antenna receivers (SISO), single-antenna
transmitters and multi-antenna receivers (SIMO), or multi-antenna transmitters
and single-antenna receivers (MISO). Different from prior work, this paper
proposes to maximize the WSR in the achievable rate region of the GIC directly
by exploiting the facts that the achievable rate region is a ""normal"" set and
the users' WSR is a ""strictly increasing"" function over the rate region.
Consequently, the WSR maximization is shown to be in the form of monotonic
optimization over a normal set and thus can be solved globally optimally by the
existing outer polyblock approximation algorithm. However, an essential step in
the algorithm hinges on how to efficiently characterize the intersection point
on the Pareto boundary of the achievable rate region with any prescribed ""rate
profile"" vector. This paper shows that such a problem can be transformed into a
sequence of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) feasibility
problems, which can be solved efficiently by existing techniques. Numerical
results validate that the proposed algorithms can achieve the global WSR
maximum for the SISO, SIMO or MISO GIC.

the modified rotation curved is not in agreement with the data. Making a step
forward, we here include also the contribution from a dark matter halo in order
to see whether this helps fitting the rotation curve data. As a test case, we
consider a sample of spiral galaxies with smooth baryon matter distribution and
well measured circular velocity profiles. It turns out that, although a
marginal agreement with the data can be found, this can only be obtained if the
dark matter halo has an unrealistically small virial mass and incredibly large
concentration. Such results can be interpreted as a strong evidence against the
reliability of the gravitational potential obtained in the modified version of

energy deposition in the target can be reduced by using a stack of thin target

to a small number of reaction channels and enables new combinations of target
isotope and final radioisotope. The narrow-bandwidth gamma excitation may make
use of collective resonances in gamma-width, leading to increased cross
sections. (gamma,gamma') isomer production via specially selected gamma
cascades allows to produce high specific activity in multiple excitations,
where no back-pumping of the isomer to the ground state occurs. The produced
isotopes will open the way for completely new clinical applications of
radioisotopes. For example ^195mPt could be used to verify the patient's

exposed to the turbulent atmospheric flows. As the response time of wind
turbine is typically in the range of seconds, they are affected by the small
scale intermittent properties of the turbulent wind. Consequently, basic
features which are known for small-scale homogeneous isotropic turbulence, and
in particular the well-known intermittency problem, have an important impact on
the wind energy conversion process. We report on basic research results
concerning the small-scale intermittent properties of atmospheric flows and
their impact on the wind energy conversion process. The analysis of wind data
shows strongly intermittent statistics of wind fluctuations. To achieve
numerical modeling a data-driven superposition model is proposed. For the
experimental reproduction and adjustment of intermittent flows a so-called
active grid setup is presented. Its ability is shown to generate reproducible
properties of atmospheric flows on the smaller scales of the laboratory
conditions of a wind tunnel. As an application example the response dynamics of
different anemometer types are tested. To achieve a proper understanding of the
impact of intermittent turbulent inflow properties on wind turbines we present
methods of numerical and stochastic modeling, and compare the results to
measurement data. As a summarizing result we find that atmospheric turbulence
imposes its intermittent features on the complete wind energy conversion
process. Intermittent turbulence features are not only present in atmospheric
wind, but are also dominant in the loads on the turbine, i.e. rotor torque and
thrust, and in the electrical power output signal. We conclude that profound
knowledge of turbulent statistics and the application of suitable numerical as

decrease of collisional coupling, a net relative motion appears between the

This results in a significant enhancement of current dissipation as compared to
the classical MHD case. We propose that the current dissipation in this

strong outflows are detected in the [FeII]1.64 \mu m emission line in a compact
region at 0.9 kpc from the nucleus. The derived mechanical energy release is
consistent with a supernova rate of 0.05-0.1 yr$^{-1}$. The apex of the
outflowing gas spatially coincides with the strongest [FeII] emission peak and
with the dominant component of the extranuclear hard X-ray emission. All these
features provide evidence for a plausible direct physical link between
supernova-driven outflows and the hard X-ray emitting gas in a LIRG. This
result is consistent with model predictions of starbursts concentrated in small
volumes and with high thermalization efficiencies. A single high-mass X-ray
binary (HMXB) as the major source of the hard X-ray emission although not
favoured, cannot be ruled out. Outside the AGN, the hard X-ray emission in NGC
5135 appears to be dominated by the hot ISM produced by supernova explosions in
a compact star-forming region, and not by the emission due to HMXB. If this
scenario is common to U/LIRGs, the hard X-rays would only trace the most
compact (< 100 pc) regions with high supernova and star formation densities,
therefore a lower limit to their integrated star formation. The SFR derived in
NGC 5135 based on its hard X-ray luminosity is a factor of two and four lower
than the values obtained from the 24 \mu m and soft X-ray luminosities,
respectively.

pinning by native deep donors. The model based on shallow donor compensation of
native acceptors was dismissed based on the assumption that it is practically
impossible to control the shallow donor doping level so precisely that the free
carrier density can be brought below the desired value suitable for radiation
detection applications. In this paper, we present our calculations on carrier
statistics and energetics of shallow donors and native defects in CdTe. Our
results show that the shallow donor can be used to reliably obtain high

treat the debiased population of the known transneptunian objects (TNOs) as
parent bodies and generate the dust with our collisional code. The resulting
dust distributions are modified to take into account the influence of
gravitational scattering and resonance trapping by planets on migrating dust
grains as well as the effect of sublimation. A difficulty is that the amount
and distribution of dust are largely determined by sub-kilometer-sized bodies.
These are directly unobservable, and their properties cannot be accessed by
collisional modeling, because objects larger than 10...60m in the present-day
EKB are not in a collisional equilibrium. To place additional constraints, we
use in-situ measurements of the New Horizons spacecraft within 20AU. We show
that the TNO population has to have a break in the size distribution at s<70km.
However, even this still leaves us with several models that all correctly
reproduce a nearly constant dust impact rates in the region of giant planet
orbits and do not violate the constraints from the non-detection of the EKB
dust thermal emission by the COBE spacecraft. The modeled EKB dust disks, which
conform to the observational constraints, can either be transport-dominated or
intermediate between the transport-dominated and collision-dominated regime.
The in-plane optical depth of such disks is tau(r>10AU)~10^-6 and their
fractional luminosity is f_d~10^-7. Planets and sublimation are found to have
little effect on dust impact fluxes and dust thermal emission. The spectral
energy distribution of an EKB analog, as would be seen from 10pc distance,
peaks at wavelengths of 40...50\mum at F~0.5mJy, which is less than 1% of the

covers the entire free space in a sweeping fashion and as such relies on the
use of robot formations. The geometry of the robot group is a lateral line
formation, which is allowed to split and rejoin when passing obstacles. It is
our main goal to exploit this formation structure in order to reduce robot
resources to a minimum. Each robot has a limited and finite amount of memory
available. No information of the topography is recorded. Communication between
two robots is only possible up to a maximum inter-robot distance, and if the
line-of-sight between both robots is not obstructed. Broadcasting capabilities
and indirect communication are not allowed. Supervisory control is prohibited.
The number of robots equipped with GPS is kept as small as possible.
Applications of the algorithm are mine field clearance, search-and-rescue
missions, and intercept missions. Simulations are included and made available
on the internet, demonstrating the flexibility of the algorithm.

mean fields dynamics associated to the widely used quasi-particle model. The
latter, able to describe lattice QCD thermodynamics, implies a ""chemical""
equilibrium ratio between quarks and gluons strongly increasing as
$T\rightarrow T_c$, the phase transition temperature. Accordingly we see in
realistic simulations of uRHIC's a rapid evolution from a gluon dominated
initial state to a quark dominated plasma close to $T_c$. The quark to gluon
ratio can be modified by about a factor of $\sim 20$ in the bulk of the system
and appears to be large also in the high $p_T$ region.
  We discuss how this aspect, often overflown, can be important for a
quantitative study of several key issues in the QGP physics: shear viscosity,
jet quenching, quarkonia suppression. Furthermore a bulk plasma made by more
than $80\%$ of quarks plus antiquarks provides a theoretical basis for
hadronization via quark coalescence.

probabilities of C, S, and X complex membership for each asteroid. For an
individual asteroid, these probabilities are rather evenly distributed over all
of the complexes, thus preventing meaningful classification. We then present

taxonomic complex preponderance for asteroid families given the distribution of
G12 in each family. For certain asteroid families, the probabilistic prediction
of taxonomic complex preponderance can clearly be made. The Nysa-Polana family
shows two distinct regions in the proper element space with different G12
values dominating in each region. We conclude that the G12-based probabilistic
distribution of taxonomic complexes through the main belt agrees with the
general view of C complex asteroid proportion increasing towards the outer

determining taxonomic complex for individual asteroids, but it can be utilized
in the statistical treatment of asteroid families and different regions of the

Specializing to the case where the ideals are unmixed of codimension two, we
show that (a) every even liaison class, $\mathcal L$, contains numerically ACM

required to build a VPL are presented, with an emphasis on a novel method of

and guiding the programmer in the right direction using constraints. These
methods are demonstrated on an example of vIDE, a VPL based on the Eclipse
integrated development environment (IDE). The design of vIDE with respect to
the Eclipse Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) is described. The concept of a

and C-type AGB stars. Because of their peculiar chemical composition, one may
expect a strong influence of the stellar C/O ratio on the molecular chemistry
and the mineralogy of the circumstellar dust. In this paper, we present a large
sample of 87 intrinsic galactic S-type AGB stars, observed at infrared
wavelengths with the Spitzer Space Telescope, and supplemented with
ground-based optical data. On the one hand, we derive the stellar parameters
from the optical spectroscopy and photometry, using a grid of model
atmospheres. On the other, we decompose the infrared spectra to quantify the
flux-contributions from the different dust species. Finally, we compare the
independently determined stellar parameters and dust properties. For the stars
without significant dust emission, we detect a strict relation between the
presence of SiS absorption in the Spitzer spectra and the C/O ratio of the
stellar atmosphere. These absorption bands can thus be used as an additional
diagnostic for the C/O ratio. For stars with significant dust emission, we
define three groups, based on the relative contribution of certain dust species
to the infrared flux. We find a strong link between group-membership and C/O
ratio. We show that these groups can be explained by assuming that the
dust-condensation can be cut short before silicates are produced, while the
remaining free atoms and molecules can then form the observed magnesium
sulfides or the carriers of the unidentified 13 and 20 micron features.
Finally, we present the detection of emission features attributed to molecules
and dust characteristic to C-type stars, such as molecular SiS, hydrocarbons
and magnesium sulfide grains. We show that we often detect magnesium sulfides
together with molecular SiS and we propose that it is formed by a reaction of
SiS molecules with Mg.

undergoes a first order phase transition in order to generate the observed
baryon asymmetry in the universe, provide a viable dark matter candidate and
explain the observed baryon-to-dark matter ratio of relic abundances
[arXiv:1003.0899]. We now provide a model in which a copy of the electroweak
gauge group is added to the Standard Model. We spontaneously break this new
gauge group to the diagonal Z_2 center which is used to stabilize a dark matter
candidate. In addition to the dark matter candidate, anomaly free messenger
fermions are included which transform non-trivially under all the gauge groups.
In analogy to electroweak baryogenesis, the model generates an excess of
messenger ""baryons"". These ""baryons"" subsequently decay to the Standard Model
and dark matter to generate an excess of Standard Model baryons. The
baryon-to-dark matter number density ratio is ultimately due to the requirement
of gauge anomaly freedom. Dark sphalerons generate operators which violate B -
L but preserves B + L. Thus, the asymmetry is not washed out by the Standard
Model. The model radiatively generates a dark matter mass of order of the
electroweak vacuum expectation value suppressed by a loop factor therefore
setting the dark matter-to-baryon relic abundance. We outline some distinctive
experimental signatures and ensure these models are consistent with existing
constraints. As first discussed in [arXiv:0907.3142], these dark matter
scenarios feature long-lived particles which can be observed at colliders. We
finally show how approximate global symmetries in the higgs sector stabilize
both the dark and electroweak scales thereby mitigating the hierarchy problem.
Light dark higgses are needed to ensure the correct relic abundance. Thus, by
construction the SM and dark higgses generate masses at two- and three-loops,
respectively.

inspired from the mammalians retina. Our coder accounts for the time-dependent
and also nondeterministic behavior of the actual retina. The present work
brings two main contributions: As a first step, (i) we design a deterministic
image coder mimicking most of the retinal processing stages and then (ii) we
introduce a retinal noise in the coding process, that we model here as a dither
signal, to gain interesting perceptual features. Regarding our first
contribution, our main source of inspiration will be the biologically plausible
model of the retina called Virtual Retina. The main novelty of this coder is to
show that the time-dependent behavior of the retina cells could ensure, in an
implicit way, scalability and bit allocation. Regarding our second
contribution, we reconsider the inner layers of the retina. We emit a possible
interpretation for the non-determinism observed by neurophysiologists in their
output. For this sake, we model the retinal noise that occurs in these layers
by a dither signal. The dithering process that we propose adds several
interesting features to our image coder. The dither noise whitens the
reconstruction error and decorrelates it from the input stimuli. Furthermore,
integrating the dither noise in our coder allows a faster recognition of the
fine details of the image during the decoding process. Our present paper goal
is twofold. First, we aim at mimicking as closely as possible the retina for
the design of a novel image coder while keeping encouraging performances.
Second, we bring a new insight concerning the non-deterministic behavior of the
retina.

arise from the joint spectral radius and restricted spectral radius approaches,
which were shown in Charina (Charina, 2011) to characterize $W^k_p-$regularity

spectral radius and the $(k,p)-$restricted spectral radius are equal. We show
that the corresponding numerical methods in the univariate scalar and vector
cases even yield the same upper estimate for the $(k,\infty)-$joint spectral
radius for a certain choice of a matrix norm. The difference between the two
approaches becomes apparent in the multivariate case and we confirm that they
indeed offer different numerical schemes for estimating the regularity of

identifying the most efficient and robust TCP version(s) for different MANET

the analysis, namely TCP Reno, TCP New Reno and TCP Selective Acknowledgment

increases in the node velocity sometimes help the TCP to attain a better
performance. The study also reveals that out of the three variants, TCP SACK
