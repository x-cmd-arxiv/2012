order superintegrable, with a symmetry algebra that closes polynomially under
Poisson brackets. This polynomial closure is typical for 2nd order
superintegrable systems in 2D and for 2nd order systems in 3D with
nondegenerate (4-parameter) potentials. However the degenerate 3-parameter
potential for the 3D extended Kepler-Coulomb system (also 2nd order
superintegrable) is an exception, as its quadratic symmetry algebra doesn't
close polynomially. The 3D 4-parameter potential for the extended
Kepler-Coulomb system is not even 2nd order superintegrable. However, Verrier
and Evans (2008) showed it was 4th order superintegrable, and Tanoudis and
Daskaloyannis (2011) showed that in the quantum case, if a second 4th order
symmetry is added to the generators, the double commutators in the symmetry
algebra close polynomially. Here, based on the Tremblay, Turbiner and
Winternitz construction, we consider an infinite class of classical extended
Kepler-Coulomb 3- and 4-parameter systems indexed by a pair of rational numbers
$(k_1,k_2)$ and reducing to the usual systems when $k_1=k_2=1$. We show these
systems to be superintegrable of arbitrarily high order and work out explicitly
the structure of the symmetry algebras determined by the 5 basis generators we
have constructed. We demonstrate that the symmetry algebras close rationally;
only for systems admitting extra discrete symmetries is polynomial closure
achieved. Underlying the structure theory is the existence of raising and
lowering constants of the motion, not themselves polynomials in the momenta,
that can be employed to construct the polynomial symmetries and their structure
relations.

the capacity region of the Cognitive Interference Channel (C-IFC), where
cognition can be obtained from either causal or non-causal generalized
feedback. For this purpose, we introduce the Causal Cognitive Interference
Channel With Delay (CC-IFC-WD) in which the cognitive user's transmission can
depend on $L$ future received symbols as well as the past ones. We show that
the CC-IFC-WD model is equivalent to a classical Causal C-IFC (CC-IFC) with
link delays. Moreover, CC-IFC-WD extends both genie-aided and causal cognitive
radio channels and bridges the gap between them. First, we derive an outer
bound on the capacity region for the arbitrary value of $L$ and specialize this
general outer bound to the strong interference case. Then, under strong
interference conditions, we tighten the outer bound. To derive the achievable
rate regions, we concentrate on three special cases: 1) Classical CC-IFC (L=0),
2) CC-IFC without delay (L=1), and 3) CC-IFC with unlimited look-ahead in which
the cognitive user non-causally knows its entire received sequence. In each
case, we obtain a new inner bound on the capacity region. Moreover, we show
that the coding strategy which we use to derive an achievable rate region for
the classical CC-IFC achieves the capacity for the classes of degraded and
semi-deterministic classical CC-IFC under strong interference conditions.
Furthermore, we extend our achievable rate regions to the Gaussian case.
Providing some numerical examples for Gaussian CC-IFC-WD, we compare the
performances of the different strategies and investigate the rate gain of the
cognitive link for different delay values.

Each pool is then tested to identify the defective items, which are usually

where pools are selected randomly and independently of the test outcomes. We
also consider a model where noisy measurements allow for both some false
negative and some false positive test outcomes (and also allow for asymmetric
noise, and activation noise). We consider three classes of algorithms for the
group testing problem (we call them specifically the ""Coupon Collector

sample-complexity bounds -- with all constants expressly computed -- for these
algorithms as a function of the desired error probability; the noise
parameters; the number of items; and the size of the defective set (or an upper
bound on it). We also compare the bounds to information-theoretic lower bounds

the multiple-scattering series, which is defined as the sum of all diagrams
where the meson scatters back and forth between a pair of static nucleons
before leaving the nucleus. In particular, the sum of this series is needed for
an accurate description of kaon-deuteron scattering, and appears as part of the
nucleon-nucleon potential. In this article we present some
effective-field-theory (EFT)-based insights into this series in the case of
two-nucleon systems. In particular, we discuss the fact that, if meson-nucleon
scattering is approximated by the scattering-length term, individual terms of
the series are divergent, and enhanced with respect to the straightforward
expectation from chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT). This apparently
indicates the presence of similarly enhanced counterterms. However, we show
that when the series is resummed the divergences cancel, such that no
additional information on short-range interactions is needed to obtain
predictions for observables after resummation. We discuss the conditions under
which this resummation is justified. We show that the same issues arise in the
$NN$ potential, where the resummed series produces poles whose appearance
indicates the breakdown scale of the $\chi$PT expansion for that quantity. This
demonstrates unequivocally that $\chi$PT cannot be applied to compute $V(r)$
for distances smaller than $r \sim 1$ fm at least in the theory without
explicit Delta(1232) degrees of freedom. We briefly discuss whether this bound
can be lowered if the Delta resonance is included in the EFT as an explicit

confirmed by numerical computation of the eigenvalues of the corresponding

the case of a uniformly distributed delay kernel, for sufficiently large width
of the delay distribution it is possible to achieve amplitude death for an

has a value in the appropriate range. For a gamma distribution of delay,
amplitude death is also possible for an arbitrary value of the average time

sufficiently smooth function, models for quadrature rules are developed using a
given {\it panel} of $n (n\geq 2)$ equally spaced points. These models arise
from the undetermined coefficients method, using a Newton's basis for
polynomials. Although part of the final product is algebraically equivalent to
the well known closed Newton-Cotes rules, the algorithms obtained are not the
classical ones.
  In the basic model the most simple quadrature rule $Q_n$ is adopted (the
so-called left rectangle rule) and a correction $\tilde E_n$ is constructed, so
that the final rule $S_n=Q_n+\tilde E_n$ is interpolatory. The correction
$\tilde E_n$, depending on the divided differences of the data, might be
considered a {\em realistic correction} for $Q_n$, in the sense that $\tilde
E_n$ should be close to the magnitude of the true error of $Q_n$, having also
the correct sign. The analysis of the theoretical error of the rule $S_n$ as
well as some classical properties for divided differences suggest the inclusion
of one or two new points in the given panel. When $n$ is even it is included
one point and two points otherwise. In both cases this approach enables the
computation of a {\em realistic error} $\bar E_{S_n}$ for the {\it extended or
corrected} rule $S_n$. The respective output $(Q_n,\tilde E_n, S_n, \bar
E_{S_n})$ contains reliable information on the quality of the approximations
$Q_n$ and $S_n$, provided certain conditions involving ratios for the
derivatives of the function $f$ are fulfilled. These simple rules are easily
converted into {\it composite} ones. Numerical examples are presented showing
that these quadrature rules are useful as a computational alternative to the

forests, this paper studies the theoretical foundations of a novel motion
planning problem: high-speed navigation through a randomly-generated obstacle
field when only the statistics of the obstacle generating process are known a
priori. Resembling a planar forest environment, the obstacle generating process
is assumed to determine the locations and sizes of disk-shaped obstacles. When
this process is ergodic, and under mild technical conditions on the dynamics of
the bird, it is shown that the existence of an infinite collision-free
trajectory through the forest exhibits a phase transition. On one hand, if the
bird flies faster than a certain critical speed, then, with probability one,
there is no infinite collision-free trajectory, i.e., the bird will eventually
collide with some tree, almost surely, regardless of the planning algorithm
governing the bird's motion. On the other hand, if the bird flies slower than
this critical speed, then there exists at least one infinite collision-free
trajectory, almost surely. Lower and upper bounds on the critical speed are
derived for the special case of a homogeneous Poisson forest considering a
simple model for the bird's dynamics. For the same case, an equivalent
percolation model is provided. Using this model, the phase diagram is
approximated in Monte-Carlo simulations. This paper also establishes novel
connections between robot motion planning and statistical physics through
ergodic theory and percolation theory, which may be of independent interest.

galaxies can be dramatic, but such processes are often neglected in
considerations of their structure and evolution. Particle acceleration
associated with high mass star formation and AGN activity not only leads to
very broad band (radio-\gamma-ray) emission, but may also produce very
significant feedback effects on galaxies and their environment. The recent
detections of starburst galaxies at GeV and TeV energies suggest that
\gamma-ray instruments have now reached the critical level of sensitivity to
probe the connection between particle acceleration and star-formation in
galaxies. In this paper we will try to summarise this recent progress, put it
into a multi-wavelength context and also discuss the prospects for more precise
and sensitive \gamma-ray measurements with the upcoming CTA observatory.

astronomical images - such as Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) - are constantly
improving, visual detection still has a role to play especially when the fixed
background is cluttered with stars. Color intensity projections (CIPs) using
hue cycling - which combines a sequence of greyscale images into a single color
image - aids in the visual detection of moving objects by highlighting them
using color in an intuitive way. To demonstrate the usefulness of CIPs in
detecting faint moving objects a sequence of 16 images from the SuprimeCam
camera of the Subaru telescope were combined into a CIPs image. As well has
making even faint moving objects easier to visually detect against a cluttered
background, CCD artefacts were also more easily recognisable. The new Hyper
SuprimeCam for the Subaru telescope - which will allow many short exposure
images to be acquired with little dead time between images - should provide
ideal data for use with the CIPs algorithm. In addition, the current search for
KBOs to be targeted by the New Horizon's spacecraft after its flyby of Pluto
provides an excellent test case for the state of the art in faint moving object
detection against a cluttered background.

probe lower H-alpha luminosities, are augmented with multi-wavelength
(rest-frame 1000AA--1.5 microns) coverage, and a large fraction (20%) of our
samples has already been spectroscopically confirmed. Our spectra allow us to
measure the Balmer decrement for nearly 60 galaxies with H-beta detected above
5-sigma. The Balmer decrements indicate an average extinction of
A(H-alpha)=0.7^{+1.4}_{-0.7} mag. We find that the Balmer decrement
systematically increases with higher H-alpha luminosities and with larger
stellar masses, in agreement with previous studies with sparser samples. We
find that the SFRs estimated from modeling the spectral energy distribution
(SED) is reliable---we derived an ""intrinsic"" H-alpha luminosity which is then
reddened assuming the color excess from SED modeling. The SED-predicted H-alpha
luminosity agrees with H-alpha narrow-band measurements over 3 dex (rms of 0.25
dex). We then use the SED SFRs to test different statistically-based dust
corrections for H-alpha and find that adopting one magnitude of extinction is
inappropriate: galaxies with lower luminosities are less reddened. We find that
the luminosity-dependent dust correction of Hopkins et al. yields consistent
results over 3 dex (rms of 0.3 dex). Our comparisons are only possible by
assuming that stellar reddening is roughly half of nebular reddening. The
strong correspondence argue that with SED modeling, we can derive reliable
intrinsic SFRs even in the absence of H-alpha measurements at z~0.5.

measured along a QSO line of sight, though typical of what is seen in GRB-DLAs.

factors ([Zn/Fe]=0.72, [Zn/Cr]=0.49) are consistent with (and only marginally

SFR=25 Msun/yr. The Ly-a line is double-peaked and is spatially extended. More
strikingly, the blue and red Ly-a peaks arise from distinct regions extended
over a few kpc on either side of the star-forming region. We propose that this
is the consequence of Ly-a transfer in outflowing gas. The presence of
starburst-driven outflows is also in agreement with the large SFR together with
a small size and low mass of the galaxy (Mvir~10^10 Msun). From the stellar UV
continuum luminosity of the galaxy, we estimate an age of at most a few 10^7
yr, again consistent with a recent starburst scenario. We interpret the data as
the observation of a young, gas rich, compact starburst galaxy, from which
material is expelled through collimated winds powered by the vigorous star
formation activity. We substantiate this picture by modelling the radiative
transfer of Ly-a photons in the galactic counterpart. Though our model (a
spherical galaxy with bipolar outflowing jets) is a simplistic representation
of the true gas distribution and velocity field, the agreement between the
observed and simulated properties is particularly good. [abridged]

optical transient from a massive (M > 40Msun) star during which the star ejects
a dense shell of material. Dust formed in the ejecta then obscures the star. In
this picture, the geometric expansion of the shell leads to clear predictions
for the evolution of the optical depths and hence the evolution of the optical
through mid-IR emissions. Here we review the theory of this standard model and
then examine the impostors SN1954J, SN1997bs, SN1999bw, SN2000ch, SN2001ac,
SN2002bu, SN2002kg and SN2003gm, as well as the potential archetype eta
Carinae. SN1999bw, SN2000ch, SN2001ac, SN2002bu and SN2003gm all show mid-IR
emission indicative of dust, and the luminosities of SN1999bw, SN2001ac,
SN2002bu and SN2003gm are dominated by dust emission. The properties of these
sources are broadly inconsistent with the predictions of the canonical model.
There are probably two classes of sources. In one class (eta Carinae, SN1954J,
SN1997bs, and (maybe) SN2003gm), the optical transient is a signal that the
star is entering a phase with very high mass loss rates that must last far
longer than the visual transient. The second class (SN1999bw, SN2001ac,
SN2002bu and (maybe) SN2003gm) has the different physics of SN2008S and the
2008 NGC300 transient, where they are obscured by dust re-forming in a
pre-existing wind after it was destroyed by an explosive transient. There are
no cases where the source at late times is significantly fainter than the
progenitor star. All these dusty transients are occurring in relatively low
mass (M < 25Msun) stars rather than high mass (M > 40Msun) stars radiating near
the Eddington limit like eta Carinae. The durations and energetics of these
transients cannot be properly characterized without near/mid-IR observations.

host cluster age. We used population synthesis to calculate the energetic
feedback and ejection of $^{26}$Al from the winds of the massive stars and
their supernova explosions. We used 7 years of INTEGRAL observations to measure
the $^{26}$Al signal from the region. The INTEGRAL $^{26}$Al signal is not
significant with a best-fit value of about 1.5e-5 ph/cm^2/s, approximately half
of the published Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) result, but in agreement
with the latest CGRO estimates. Our analysis of the stellar populations in the
young clusters leads to an expected signal of half the observed value, but the
results are consistent within 2 sigma. We find that the fraction of $^{26}$Al
ejected in Wolf-Rayet winds is high, and the observed signal is unlikely to be
caused by $^{26}$Al ejected in supernovae alone, indicating a strong wind
ejection of $^{26}$Al. Due to the lack of prominent O stars, regions with ages
$\gtrsim$10 Myr are often neglected in studies of OB associations. We find that
in the Carina region such clusters contribute significantly to the stellar mass

annihilation to tt* can affect indirect detection, notably by competing with

Kaluza-Klein reduction ansatz. In particular, the flux sources a warp factor
which also depends on the torus directions of the compactification fourfold.
This dependence is crucial in the derivation of the four-dimensional action,
although the torus fiber is auxiliary in F-theory. In M-theory the 7-branes are
described by an infinite array of Taub-NUT spaces. We use the explicit metric
on this geometry to derive the locally corrected warp factor and M-theory
three-from as closed expressions. We focus on contributions to the 7-brane
gauge coupling function from this M-theory back-reaction and show that terms
quadratic in the internal seven-brane flux are induced. The real part of the
gauge coupling function is modified by the M-theory warp factor while the
imaginary part is corrected due to a modified M-theory three-form potential.
The obtained contributions match the known weak string coupling result, but
also yield additional terms suppressed at weak coupling. This shows that the
completion of the M-theory reduction opens the way to compute various
corrections in a genuine F-theory setting away from the weak string coupling

sensitively on the radial profile slope of the lens mass distribution;
consequently, the lens slope must be accurately constrained for cosmological

two-component sources provided the separation between the image components can
be measured with milliarcsecond precisions, which is not feasible in most

source galaxy in two-image systems break the radial slope degeneracy and allow
D_dt to be measured with uncertainties of a few percent. Deep and
high-resolution imaging of the lens systems are needed to reveal the extended

using spectra obtained with NIRSPEC at the W. M. Keck Observatory. Radial
velocity precisions of 50 m/s are achieved for old field mid-M dwarfs using
telluric features for precise wavelength calibration. Using this technique, 20
young stars in the {\beta} Pic (age ~12 Myr) and TW Hya (age ~8 Myr)
Associations were monitored over several years to search for low mass
companions; we also included the chromospherically active field star GJ 873 (EV
Lac) in this survey. Based on comparisons with previous optical observations of
these young active stars, radial velocity measurements at infrared wavelengths
mitigate the radial velocity noise caused by star spots by a factor of ~3.
Nevertheless, star spot noise is still the dominant source of measurement error
for young stars at 2.3 {\mu}m, and limits the precision to ~77 m/s for the
slowest rotating stars (v sin i < 6 km/s), increasing to ~168 m/s for rapidly
rotating stars (v sin i > 12 km/s). The observations reveal both GJ 3305 and
TWA 23 to be single-lined spectroscopic binaries; in the case of GJ 3305, the
motion is likely caused by its 0.09"" companion, identified after this survey
began. The large amplitude, short-timescale variations of TWA 13A are
indicative of a hot Jupiter-like companion, but the available data are
insufficient to confirm this. We label it as a candidate radial velocity
variable. For the remainder of the sample, these observations exclude the
presence of any 'hot' (P < 3 days) companions more massive than 8 MJup, and any
'warm' (P < 30 days) companions more massive than 17 MJup, on average. Assuming
an edge-on orbit for the edge-on disk system AU Mic, these observations exclude
the presence of any hot Jupiters more massive than 1.8 MJup or warm Jupiters
more massive than 3.9 MJup.

model. It asserts that $H$, the transfer matrix which couples the $m_t$ inputs
into $m_r$ outputs, is a sub-matrix of an $m\times m$ random (Haar-distributed)
unitary matrix. The (squared) singular values of $H$ follow the law of the
classical Jacobi ensemble of random matrices; hence the name of the channel.
One motivation to define such a channel comes from multimode/multicore optical
fiber communication. It turns out that this model can be qualitatively
different than the Rayleigh model, leading to interesting practical and
theoretical results. This work first evaluates the ergodic capacity of the
channel. Then, it considers the non-ergodic case, where it analyzes the outage
probability and the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff. In the case where
$k=m_t+m_r-m > 0$ it is shown that at least $k$ degrees of freedom are
guaranteed not to fade for any channel realization, enabling a zero outage
probability or infinite diversity order at the corresponding rates. A simple
scheme utilizing (a possibly outdated) channel state feedback is provided,
attaining the no-outage guarantee. Finally, noting that as $m$ increases, the
Jacobi model approaches the Rayleigh model, the paper discusses the
applicability of the model in other communication scenaria.

cavities of low density relativistic plasma and drive shock and sound waves
into the intracluster medium. When these waves overrun previously inflated
cavities, they form a differentially rotating vortex through the
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability. The dissipation of energy captured in the vortex
can contribute to the feedback of energy into the atmospheres of cool core
clusters. Using a series of hydrodynamic simulations we investigate the
efficiency of this process: we calculate the kinetic energy in the vortex by
decomposing the velocity field into its irrotational and solenoidal parts.
Compared to the two-dimensional case, the 3-dimensional Richtmyer-Meshkov
instability is about a factor of 2 more efficient. The energy in the vortex
field for weak shocks is E_vortex ~ rho_ICM v_shock^2 V_bubble (with dependence
on the geometry, density contrast, and shock width). For strong shocks, the
vortex becomes dynamically unstable, quickly dissipating its energy via a
turbulent cascade. We derive a number of diagnostics for observations and
laboratory experiments of shock-bubble interactions, like the shock-vortex
standoff distance, which can be used to derive lower limits on the Mach number.
The differential rotation of the vortex field leads to viscous dissipation,
which is sufficiently efficient to react to cluster cooling and to dissipate
the vortex energy within the cooling radius of the cluster for a reasonable
range of vortex parameters. For sufficiently large filling factors (of order a
few percent or larger), this process could thus contribute significantly to AGN
feedback in galaxy clusters.

characterize completely the biconnectivity properties of undirected networks:
articulation points, bridges, and connected and biconnected components. The
motivation of our work was the development of a real-time algorithm to monitor
the connectivity of the Autonomous Systems (AS) Network, but the solution
provided is general enough to be applied to any network.
  The network structure is represented by a graph, and the algorithm is
analyzed in the datastream framework. Here, as in the \emph{on-line} model, the
input graph is revealed one item (i.e., graph edge) after the other, in an
on-line fashion; but, if compared to traditional on-line computation, there are
stricter requirements for both memory occupation and per item processing time.
Our algorithm works by properly updating a forest over the graph nodes. All the
graph (bi)connectivity properties are stored in this forest. We prove the
correctness of the algorithm, together with its space ($O(n\,\log n)$, with $n$
being the number of nodes in the graph) and time bounds.
  We also present the results of a brief experimental evaluation against
real-world graphs, including many samples of the AS network, ranging from
medium to massive size. These preliminary experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach.

irregularities. In cases where this statistics is approximately the same over
the entire landscape, or where non-local moves couple distant parts of the
landscape, single-temperature MC will outperform any other MC algorithm with
the same move set. We also find that in strongly anisotropic Coulomb spin glass
and traveling salesman problems, the only relevant statistics (which we use to
assign a single MC temperature) is that of irregularities in low-energy
funnels. Our results may explain why protein folding in nature is efficient at
room temperatures.

components of the Universe - dark matter and dark energy - are accounted for by
a single ""dark fluid"" have drawn increasing attention and interest. Amongst
many proposals, Unified Dark Matter (UDM) cosmologies are promising candidates
as effective theories. In these models, a scalar field with a non-canonical
kinetic term in its Lagrangian mimics both the accelerated expansion of the
Universe at late times and the clustering properties of the large-scale
structure of the cosmos. However, UDM models also present peculiar behaviours,
the most interesting one being the fact that the perturbations in the
dark-matter component of the scalar field do have a non-negligible speed of
sound. This gives rise to an effective Jeans scale for the Newtonian potential,
below which the dark fluid does not cluster any more. This implies a growth of
structures fairly different from that of the concordance LCDM model. In this
paper, we demonstrate that forthcoming large-scale surveys will be able to
discriminate between viable UDM models and LCDM to a good degree of accuracy.
To this purpose, the planned Euclid satellite will be a powerful tool, since it
will provide very accurate data on galaxy clustering and the weak lensing
effect of cosmic shear. Finally, we also exploit the constraining power of the
ongoing CMB Planck experiment. Although our approach is the most conservative,
with the inclusion of only well-understood, linear dynamics, in the end we also
show what could be done if some amount of non-linear information were included.

halo of the Galaxy for the first time. Both the Galaxy and the LMC are modeled
as N-body particles in our models so that the dynamical influences of the LMC
on the Galaxy can be investigated in a fully self-consistent manner.
Furthermore, the orbital parameters for the LMC are carefully chosen such that
the present location of the LMC in the Galaxy can be rather precisely
reproduced in our simulations. We particularly investigate the influences of
the LMC on the precession rate, the outer stellar and gaseous structures, and
the star formation history of the Galaxy. Our principals results are summarized
as follows. The LMC-Galaxy dynamical interaction can cause ""pole shift"" (or
irregular precession/nutation) of the Galaxy and the typical rate of pole shift
(dot {\theta}_{d}) is ~2 degree Gyr^{-1} corresponding to ~ 7 muas yr^{-1}. The
LMC-Galaxy interaction induces the formation of the outer warp structures of
the Galaxy, which thus confirms the results of previous numerical simulations
on the formation of the Galactic warp. The LMC-Galaxy interaction also induces
the formation of outer (R>20 kpc) spiral arms and increases the vertical
velocity dispersion of the outer disk significantly. The mean star formation
rate of the Galaxy for the last several Gyrs can be hardly influenced by the
LMC's tidal force. The age and metallicity distribution of stars in the
solar-neighborhood (7 kpc < R < 10 kpc) for the last several Gyr can be only
slightly changed by the past LMC-Galaxy interaction. Based on these results, we
discuss how the possible ongoing Galactic pole shift with 10 muas yr^{-1} can
be detected by future observational studies by GAIA.

  By ""harden"" we mean that certain error-checking if-conditionals in a given

semi-automatic program analysis techniques to reason about the hardened program
paths and thus cannot discover as-yet-unknown errors along those paths, except
perhaps through black-box dictionary attacks or random testing (which we can
never prevent).
  Other than these unpreventable attack methods, we can make program analysis
aimed at error-finding ""provably hard"" for a resource-bounded attacker, in the
same sense that cryptographic schemes are hard to break. Unlike
security-through-obscurity, in Cryptographic Path Hardening we use
provably-secure crypto devices to hide errors and our mathematical arguments of
security are the same as the standard ones used in cryptography.
  One application of Cryptographic Path Hardening is that software patches or
filters often reveal enough information to an attacker that they can be used to
construct error-revealing inputs to exploit an unpatched version of the
program. By ""hardening"" the patch we make it difficult for the attacker to
analyze the patched program to construct error-revealing inputs, and thus
prevent him from potentially constructing exploits.

In particular, it is shown that for a local ring $(R, \cal{M})$, the following

cyclic $R$-modules; (2) ${\cal{M}}=\bigoplus_{\lambda\in \Lambda}Rw_{\lambda}$

unicast communication over a layered wireless relay network with directed links
is considered. A relay node performing analog network coding scales and
forwards the signals received at its input. Recently this problem has been
considered under two assumptions: (A) each relay node scales its received
signal to the upper bound of its transmit power constraint, (B) the relay nodes
in specific subsets of the network operate in the high-SNR regime. We establish
that assumption (A), in general, leads to suboptimal end-to-end rate. We also
characterize the performance of analog network coding in class of symmetric
layered networks without assumption (B).
  The key contribution of this work is a lemma that states that a globally
optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes in a layered relay network that
maximizes the end-to-end rate can be computed layer-by-layer. Specifically, a
rate-optimal set of scaling factors for the nodes in a layer is the one that
maximizes the sum-rate of the nodes in the next layer. This critical insight
allows us to characterize analog network coding performance in network
scenarios beyond those that can be analyzed using the existing approaches. We
illustrate this by computing the maximum rate achievable with analog network
coding in one particular layered network, in various communication scenarios.

Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism taking into account the contribution of the

study of the temperature dependence of this phonon mode as a function of Se $x$
and excess Fe $y$ concentrations. In parent compound Fe$_{1+y}$Te, we observe
an unconventional broadening of the phonon between room temperature and
magnetic ordering temperature $T_N$. The situation smoothly evolves towards a
regular anharmonic behavior as Te is substituted for Se and long range magnetic
order is replaced by superconductivity. Irrespective to Se contents, excess Fe
is shown to provide an additional damping channel for the B$_{1g}$ phonon at
low temperatures. We performed Density Functional Theory (DFT) ab-initio
calculations within the local density approximation (LDA) to calcuate the
phonon frequencies including magnetic polarization and Fe non-stoichiometry in
the Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA). We obtained a good agreement with the
measured phonon frequencies in the Fe-deficient samples, while the effects of
Fe excess are poorly reproduced. This may be due to excess Fe-induced local
magnetism and low energy magnetic fluctuations that can not be treated
accurately within these approaches. As recently revealed by neutron scattering
and $\mu$-SR studies, these phenomena occur in the temperature range where
anomalous decay of the B$_{1g}$ phonon is observed, and suggests a peculiar

photon pairs born in different place of the inhomogeneous PCF are coherently
superposed, and a modulation in the broadened spectrum of phase matching
function will appear, which prevents the realization of spectral factorable
photon pairs. In particular, the inhomogeneity induced modulation can be
examined by measuring the spectrum of individual signal or idler field when the
asymmetric group velocity matching is approximately fulfilled. Our experiments
are performed by tailoring the spectrum of pulsed pump to satisfy the specified
phase matching condition. The observed spectra of individual signal photons,
which are produced from different segments of the 1.9 m inhomogeneous PCF,
agree with the theoretical predictions. The investigations are not only useful

domain wall (DW) by a ferromagnetic Josephson junction, which is composed of a
ferromagnetic wire with DW and two superconducting electrodes. The
current-voltage curve exhibits stepwise structures, only when DW oscillates in
the ferromagnetic wire. The voltage step appears at V = n(\hbar/2e)\omega_DW
with the fundamental constant \hbar/e, integer number n, and the DW frequency
\omega_DW. Since V can be determined in the order of 10^9 accuracy, the
oscillatory DW will be measured more precisely than present status by
conventional method.

survey (Hi-GAL) to study 3171 infrared-dark cloud (IRDC) candidates that were

'Spitzer-dark' regions). They all lie in the range l=300 - 330 \circ and |b| 6
1 \circ. Of these, only 1205 were seen in emission in the far-infrared (250-500

that a dense cloud will not only be seen in absorption in the mid-infrared, but
will also be seen in emission in the far-infrared at the longest Herschel
wavebands (250-500 {\mu}m). If a region is dark at all wavelengths throughout
the mid-infrared and far-infrared, then it is most likely to be simply a region
of lower background infrared emission (a 'hole in the sky'). Hence, it appears
that previous surveys, based on Spitzer and other mid-infrared data alone, may
have over-estimated the total IRDC population by a factor of 2. This has
implications for estimates of the star formation rate in IRDCs in the Galaxy.We
studied the 1205 Herschel-bright IRDCs at 250 {\mu}m, and found that 972 of
them had at least one clearly defined 250-{\mu}m peak, indicating that they

comparison to that expected according to the Drude model. The real part,

addition of extra conductivity without any dissipations in the Drude-type
conductivity. The origin of this ultralow-dissipative conductivity is found to

Accepted by ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/749/1/65",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While the selection of strongly lensed galaxies with 500{\mu}m flux density
S_500>100 mJy has proven to be rather straightforward (Negrello et al. 2010),
for many applications it is important to analyze samples larger than the ones
obtained when confining ourselves to such a bright limit. Moreover, only by
probing to fainter flux densities is possible to exploit strong lensing to
investigate the bulk of the high-z star-forming galaxy population. We describe
HALOS (the Herschel-ATLAS Lensed Objects Selection), a method for efficiently
selecting fainter candidate strongly lensed galaxies, reaching a surface
density of ~1.5-2 deg^-2, i.e. a factor of about 4 to 6 higher than that at the
100 mJy flux limit. HALOS will allow the selection of up to ~1000 candidate
strongly lensed galaxies (with amplifications \mu>2) over the full H-ATLAS
survey area. Applying HALOS to the H-ATLAS Science Demonstration Phase field
(~14.4 deg^2) we find 31 candidate strongly lensed galaxies, whose candidate
lenses are identified in the VIKING near-infrared catalog. Using the available
information on candidate sources and candidate lenses we tentatively estimate a
~72% purity of the sample. The redshift distribution of the candidate lensed
sources is close to that reported for most previous surveys for lensed
galaxies, while that of candidate lenses extends to substantially higher
redshifts than found in the other surveys. The counts of candidate strongly
lensed galaxies are also in good agreement with model predictions (Lapi et al.
2011). Even though a key ingredient of the method is the deep near-infrared
VIKING photometry, we show that H-ATLAS data alone allow the selection of a
similarly deep sample of candidate strongly lensed galaxies with an efficiency
close to 50%; a slightly lower surface density (~1.45 deg^-2) can be reached
with a ~70% efficiency.

results compare well for times when measured fluxes are dominated by NISHe (and
contributions from other species are small). Differences between simulations

neutral helium, likely produced by interaction of interstellar helium with
plasma in the outer heliosheath. Interstellar neutral parameters are
statistically different from previous in situ results obtained mostly from the
GAS/Ulysses experiment, but they do agree with the local interstellar flow
vector obtained from studies of interstellar absorption: the newly-established
flow direction is ecliptic longitude 79.2 deg, latitude -5.1 deg, the velocity
is \sim 22.8 km/s, and the temperature is 6200 K. These new results imply a
markedly lower absolute velocity of the gas and thus significantly lower
dynamic pressure on the boundaries of the heliosphere and different orientation
of the Hydrogen Deflection Plane compared to prior results from Ulysses. A
different orientation of this plane also suggests a new geometry of the
interstellar magnetic field and the lower dynamic pressure calls for a
compensation by other components of the pressure balance, most likely a higher
density of interstellar plasma and strength of interstellar magnetic field.

we address the main issues obstructing the application of this powerful

frequency independent perfectly matched layers to simulate the extension to

rational approximation of the square root are implemented leading to perfectly
matched layers with a controlled accuracy over a complete spectral interval of
interest. A new Krylov-based solution method via stability-corrected operator
exponents is presented which allows us to construct reduced-order models (ROMs)
that respect the delicate spectral properties of the original scattering
problem. The ROMs are unconditionally stable and are based on a renormalized
bi-Lanczos algorithm. We give a theoretical foundation of our method and
illustrate its performance through a number of numerical examples in which we
simulate 2D electromagnetic wave propagation in unbounded domains, including a
photonic waveguide example. The new algorithm outperforms the conventional
finite-difference time domain method for problems on large time intervals.

the difference between network partitions produced by community detection

solution, the underlying stochastic process used to compare partitions is
extended to deal with covers, and the random variables of the new process are
simply fed into the usual definition of mutual information. With partitions,
our extended process behaves exactly as the conventional approach for
partitions, and thus, the mutual information values obtained are the same. We
also describe how to perform sampling and do error estimation for our extended

population. A mutant with relative fitness $r$ is introduced into a population
and the system evolves, either reaching fixation (in which every individual is
a mutant) or extinction (in which none is). In a widely cited paper (Nature,
2005), Lieberman, Hauert and Nowak generalize the model to populations on the
vertices of graphs. They describe a class of graphs (called ""superstars""), with
a parameter $k$. Superstars are designed to have an increasing fixation
probability as $k$ increases. They state that the probability of fixation tends
to $1-r^{-k}$ as graphs get larger but we show that this claim is untrue as
stated. Specifically, for $k=5$, we show that the true fixation probability (in
the limit, as graphs get larger) is at most $1-1/j(r)$ where
$j(r)=\Theta(r^4)$, contrary to the claimed result. We do believe that the
qualitative claim of Lieberman et al.\ --- that the fixation probability of
superstars tends to 1 as $k$ increases --- is correct, and that it can probably
be proved along the lines of their sketch. We were able to run larger computer
simulations than the ones presented in their paper. However, simulations on
graphs of around 40,000 vertices do not support their claim. Perhaps these
graphs are too small to exhibit the limiting behaviour.

wind nebula and X-ray-radio plerion associated with an extended TeV source HESS
J1356-645. We present our deep optical observations with the Very Large
Telescope to search for an optical counterpart of the pulsar and its nebula. We
detect a point-like source in V, R, and I bands whose position is within the
1-sigma error circle of the X-ray position of the pulsar, and whose colours are
distinct from those of ordinary stars. We consider it as a candidate optical
counterpart of the pulsar. If it is indeed the counterpart, its 5-sigma offset
from the radio pulsar position, measured about 9 yr earlier, implies that the
transverse velocity of the pulsar is in the range of 1600--2000 km s^{-1} at
the distance of 2--2.5 kpc, making it the fastest moving pulsar known. The
direction of the estimated proper motion coincides with the extension of the
pulsar's X-ray tail, suggesting that this is a jet. The tentative optical
luminosity and efficiency of the pulsar are similar to those of the Vela
pulsar, which also supports the optical identification. However, the candidate
undergoes an unusually steep dereddened flux increase towards the infrared with
a spectral index of about 5, that is not typical of optical pulsars. It implies
a strong double-knee spectral break in the pulsar emission between the optical
and X-rays. The reasons for the spectral steepness are unclear. It may be
caused by a nebula knot projected onto the jet and strongly overlapping with
the pulsar, as observed for the Crab, where the knot has a significantly
steeper spectrum than the pulsar. We find no other signs of the pulsar nebula
in the optical. Alternatively, the detected source may be a faint AGN, that has
not yet been seen at other wavelengths.

Their variability and possible association were studied. In this talk we will
focus on the results of extensive observations of the Carina Region during the
time period 2007 July - 2009 January, for a total livetime of ~130 days. The
region is extremely complex, hosting massive star formation, with the
remarkable colliding wind binary Eta Carinae, massive star clusters and HII
regions (e.g. NGC 3324, RCW49, Westerlund II) and a giant molecular cloud
extending over 150 pc (between l=284.7 and l=289). The Carina Nebula itself is
the largest and IR highest surface brightness nebula of the Southern emisphere.
We monitored several gamma ray sources in the Carina Region. In particular we
detect a gamma ray source (1AGL J1043-5931) consistent with the position of Eta
Carinae and report a remarkable 2-days gamma-ray flaring episode from this
source on 2008 Oct 11-13. If 1AGL J1043-5931 is associated with the Eta Car
system, our data provides the long sought first detection above 100 MeV of a
colliding wind binary.

Mearth orbiting well within the canonical definition of the star's liquid water
habitable zone, this is, the region around the star at which an Earth-like
planet could sustain liquid water on its surface. Still, the ultimate water
supporting capability of this candidate depends on properties that are unknown

among a potential 91-day signal, and the likely rotation period of the star at

bounds, and invariant regions for a class of switching continuous-time linear
systems with perturbation bounds that may depend nonlinearly on a delayed
state. The main advantage of the method is its componentwise nature, i.e. the
fact that it allows each component of the perturbation vector to have an
independent bound and that the bounds and sets obtained are also given
componentwise. This componentwise method does not employ a norm for bounding
either the perturbation or state vectors, avoids the need for scaling the
different state vector components in order to obtain useful results, and may
also reduce conservativeness in some cases. We give conditions for the derived
bounds to be of local or semi-global nature. In addition, we deal with the case
of perturbation bounds whose dependence on a delayed state is of affine form as
a particular case of nonlinear dependence for which the bounds derived are
shown to be globally valid. A sufficient condition for practical stability is
also provided. The present paper builds upon and extends to switching systems
with delayed-state-dependent perturbations previous results by the authors. In
this sense, the contribution is three-fold: the derivation of the
aforementioned extension; the elucidation of the precise relationship between
the class of switching linear systems to which the proposed method can be
applied and those that admit a common quadratic Lyapunov function (a question
that was left open in our previous work); and the derivation of a technique to
compute a common quadratic Lyapunov function for switching linear systems with
perturbations bounded componentwise by affine functions of the absolute value
of the state vector components.

galaxies in 20 HCGs with available atomic hydrogen (HI) VLA maps, covering a
wide range of HI deficiencies and evolutionary phases of the groups, and
containing at least one spiral galaxy. We derived the far-infrared (FIR)
luminosity (\lfir) from IRAS data and used it as a tracer of the SFR. We
calculated the HI mass, \lfir and \mhtwo deficiencies. The mean deficiencies of
\lfir and \mhtwo of spiral galaxies in HCGs are close to 0, indicating that
their average SFR and molecular gas content are similar to those of isolated
galaxies. However, there are indications of an excess in \mhtwo\($\sim$ 50%) in
spiral galaxies in HCGs which can be interpreted as either an enhanced
molecular gas content or as a higher concentration of \mhtwo towards the center
in comparison to galaxies in lower density environments. In contrast, the mean
\mhi of spiral galaxies in HCGs is only 12% of the expected value. The specific
star formation rate (sSFR= SFR/stellar mass) tends to be lower for galaxies
with a higher \mhtwo\ or \mhi\ deficiency. This trend is not seen for the star
formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/\mhtwo). We found tentative indications for an
enhancement of \mhtwo\ in spiral galaxies in HCGs in an early evolutionary
phase and a decrease in later phases. We suggest that this might be due to an
enhancement of the conversion from atomic to molecular gas due to on-going
tidal interactions in an early evolutionary phase, followed by HI stripping and
a decrease of the molecular gas content because of lack of replenishment.

radio devices that are observing the availability pattern of a number of
primary users(PUs), to cooperate and use \emph{Bayesian nonparametric}
techniques to estimate the distributions of the PUs' activity pattern, assumed
to be completely unknown. In the proposed model, each cognitive node may have
its own individual view on each PU's distribution, and, hence, seeks to find
partners having a correlated perception. To address this problem, a coalitional
game is formulated between the cognitive devices and an algorithm for
cooperative coalition formation is proposed. It is shown that the proposed
coalition formation algorithm allows the cognitive nodes that are experiencing
a similar behavior from some PUs to self-organize into disjoint, independent
coalitions. Inside each coalition, the cooperative cognitive nodes use a
combination of Bayesian nonparametric models such as the Dirichlet process and
statistical goodness of fit techniques in order to improve the accuracy of the
estimated PUs' activity distributions. Simulation results show that the
proposed algorithm significantly improves the estimates of the PUs'
distributions and yields a performance advantage, in terms of reduction of the
average achieved Kullback-Leibler distance between the real and the estimated
distributions, reaching up to 36.5% relative the non-cooperative estimates. The
results also show that the proposed algorithm enables the cognitive nodes to
adapt their cooperative decisions when the actual PUs' distributions change due
to, for example, PU mobility.

nitrogen atoms. The decoupling efficiency of various DD schemes is studied,
including both periodic and periodic pulse sequences. For ideal control pulses,
we find that the DD protocols with the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) timing
of the pulses provides best performance. We show that, as the number of control
pulses increases, the decoupling fidelity scaling differs qualitatively from
the predictions of the Magnus expansion, and explain the origin of this
difference. In particular, more advanced symmetrized or concatenated protocols
do not improve the DD performance. Next, we investigate the impact of the
systematic instrumental pulse errors in different periodic and aperiodic pulse
sequences. The DD protocols with the single-axis control do not preserve all
spin components in the presence of the pulse errors, and the two-axis control
is needed. We demonstrate that the two-axis control sequence with the CPMG
timing is very robust with respect to the pulse errors. The impact of the pulse
errors can be diminished further by symmetrizing this protocol. For all
protocols studied here, we present a detailed account of the pulse error
parameters which make strongest impact on the DD performance. In conclusion, we

the costs in terms of the delay due to multi-hop transmission. For forming the
tree structure, a distributed myopic algorithm is devised. Using the proposed
algorithm, each RS can individually select the path that connects it to the BS
through other RSs while optimizing its utility. We show the convergence of the
algorithm into a Nash tree network, and we study how the RSs can adapt the
network's topology to environmental changes such as mobility or the deployment
of new mobile stations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm
presents significant gains in terms of average utility per mobile station which
is at least 17.1% better relatively to the case with no RSs and reaches up to
40.3% improvement compared to a nearest neighbor algorithm (for a network with
10 RSs). The results also show that the average number of hops does not exceed
3 even for a network with up to 25 RSs.

radiative corrections to single W hadroproduction in the POWHEG BOX framework,
treating soft and collinear photon emissions on the same ground as coloured
parton emissions. This framework can be easily extended to more complex
electroweak processes. We describe how next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak
corrections are combined with the NLO QCD calculation, and show how they are
interfaced to QCD and QED shower Monte Carlo. The resulting tool fills a gap in
the literature and allows to study comprehensively the interplay of QCD and
electroweak effects to W production using a single computational framework.
Numerical comparisons with the predictions of the electroweak generator HORACE,
as well as with existing results on the combination of electroweak and QCD

reliability and accuracy of the approach

~10^17 eV, including secondary neutral particles and in particular neutrinos.
The most important open questions are related to the mass composition and sky
distributions of these particles as well as on the location and nature of their
sources. High energy neutrinos at GeV energies and above from extra-terrestrial
sources have not yet been detected and experimental upper limits start to put
strong contraints on the sources and the acceleration mechanism of very high
energy cosmic rays.

an inherent tradeoff between spectrum sensing and spectrum access. Although
each SU has an incentive to sense the primary user (PU) channels for locating
spectrum holes, this exploration of the spectrum can come at the expense of a
shorter transmission time, and, hence, a possibly smaller capacity for data
transmission. This paper investigates the impact of this tradeoff on the
cooperative strategies of a network of SUs that seek to cooperate in order to
improve their view of the spectrum (sensing), reduce the possibility of
interference among each other, and improve their transmission capacity
(access). The problem is modeled as a coalitional game in partition form and an
algorithm for coalition formation is proposed. Using the proposed algorithm,
the SUs can make individual distributed decisions to join or leave a coalition
while maximizing their utilities which capture the average time spent for
sensing as well as the capacity achieved while accessing the spectrum. It is
shown that, by using the proposed algorithm, the SUs can self-organize into a
network partition composed of disjoint coalitions, with the members of each
coalition cooperating to jointly optimize their sensing and access performance.
Simulation results show the performance improvement that the proposed algorithm
yields with respect to the non-cooperative case. The results also show how the
algorithm allows the SUs to self-adapt to changes in the environment such as
the change in the traffic of the PUs, or slow mobility.

used to construct variational principles for symmetric equilibrium

condition, which allows the description in terms of a magnetic flux function,
is exploited to deduce a symmetric form of the noncanonical Poisson bracket of

Equilibria are obtained from an energy-Casimir principle and reduced forms of
this variational principle are obtained by the elimination of algebraic

theoretical framework to explain the apparent violations of the standard
Lorentz code (SLC), the possible manifestations of which arise in a similar way
in all particle sectors. We argue that in the ELC-framework the propagation of
the superluminal particle, which implies the modified dispersion relation,
could be consistent with causality. Furthermore, in this framework, we give a
justification of forbiddance of Vavilov-Cherenkov (VC)-radiation/or analog
processes in vacuum. To be consistent with the SN1987A and OPERA data, we
identify the neutrinos from SN1987A and the light as so-called {\it 1-th type}
particles carrying the {\it individual Lorentz motion code} with the velocity
of light $c_{1}\equiv c$ in vacuum as maximum attainable velocity for all the
1-th type particles. Thereby, we treat superluminal muon neutrinos as so-called
{\it 2-nd type} particles carrying the individual Lorentz motion code with the
velocity $c_{2}$ as maximum attainable velocity for all the 2-nd type

velocity $(v_{\nu 2}-c)/c= 2.48\times 10^{-5}$, and expected finite rest mass

dielectric with refraction index n (S.Antoci, et.al, 2007), we suggest
generalization of the Einstein-Plank-Richardson law for the value of the light
energy quantum in medium:E=h*nu*n, where h is the Plank's constant, and nu is
the light frequency. By use of this new quantum law, we resolve the famous
contradiction between de Broglie and Einstein's theories, related with the old
Abraham-Minkowski dilemma in the definition of the photon momentum value p (in
the medium for n>1). We show that the same value p=p_a=E/(c*n)(c is the speed
of light in vacuum) follows now from the both theories of de Broglie and
Einstein, which complies with the theory of Abraham, but not with the theory of
Minkowski (where p=p_m=E*n/c). Based on the corpuscular approach with p=p_a and
E=h*nu*n^2, we give new inference for the Snellius refraction law and resolve
more old corresponding corpuscular-wave Newton-Huygens dilemma. We show that
even for n-1<<1 the Abraham and Minkowski theories (with different p=p_a and
p=p_m)may lead to very different conclusions. Thus, only the theory with p=p_a,
contrary to the theory with p=p_m, allows the conclusion about the
Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation realization in the photon gas of the background
cosmic radiation, for which n-1=10^(-42) in the current epoch.
