by obscure components (dark matter and dark energy) for ~95% of its energy
budget. In particular, almost all the matter content in the Universe is given
by dark matter, which dominates the mass budget and drives the dynamics of
galaxies and clusters of galaxies. Unfortunately, dark matter and dark energy
have not been detected and no direct or indirected observations have allowed to
prove their existence and amount. For this reason, some authors have suggested
that a modification of Einstein Relativity or the change of the Newton's
dynamics law (within a relativistic and classical framework, respectively)
could allow to replace these unobserved components. We will start discussing
the role of dark matter in the early-type galaxies, mainly in their central
regions, investigating how its content changes as a function of the mass and
the size of each galaxy and few considerations about the stellar Initial mass
function have been made. In the second part of the paper we have described, as
examples, some ways to overcome the dark matter hypothesis, by fitting to the
observations the modified dynamics coming out from general relativistic
extended theories and the MOdyfied Newtonian dynamics (MOND).

this scenario is difficult to be directly tested with collider experiments. In

to calculate the location of a special trajectory, called a maximal canard, in

with controllable energy gaps in different Landau levels. It also allows one to

exploration and exploitation, and must be able to rapidly generalize from
observations. While in the past a number of related sample efficient RL
algorithms have been proposed, to allow theoretical analysis, mainly
model-learners with weak generalization capabilities were considered. Here, we
separate function approximation in the model learner (which does require
samples) from the interpolation in the planner (which does not require
samples). For model-learning we apply Gaussian processes regression (GP) which
is able to automatically adjust itself to the complexity of the problem (via
Bayesian hyperparameter selection) and, in practice, often able to learn a
highly accurate model from very little data. In addition, a GP provides a
natural way to determine the uncertainty of its predictions, which allows us to
implement the ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" principle used to
efficiently control exploration. Our method is evaluated on four common

local universe, especially in denser environments. To investigate the fate of
such massive galaxies identified at z~2 we analyse the evolution of their
properties in three cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that form
virialised galaxy groups of mass ~10^13 Msun hosting a central massive
elliptical/S0 galaxy by redshift zero. We find that at redshift ~2 the
population of galaxies with M_*> 2 10^10 Msun is diverse in terms of mass,
velocity dispersion, star formation and effective radius, containing both very
compact and relatively extended objects. In each simulation all the compact
satellite galaxies have merged into the central galaxy by redshift 0 (with the
exception of one simulation where one of such satellite galaxy survives).
Satellites of similar mass at z = 0 are all less compact than their high
redshift counterparts. They form later than the galaxies in the z = 2 sample
and enter the group potential at z < 1, when dynamical friction times are
longer than the Hubble time. Also, by z = 0 the central galaxies have increased
substantially their characteristic radius via a combination of in situ star
formation and mergers. Hence in a group environment descendants of compact
galaxies either evolve towards larger sizes or they disappear before the
present time as a result of the environment in which they evolve. Since the
group-sized halos that we consider are representative of dense environments in
the LambdaCDM cosmology, we conclude that the majority of high redshift compact
massive galaxies do not survive until today as a result of the environment.

substantial progress was achieved: (i) For the TAUOLA Monte Carlo generator of
tau-lepton decays, automated and simultaneous use of many versions of form
factors for the calculation of optional weights for fits was developed and
checked to work in the Belle and BaBar software environment. Alternative
parameterizations of hadronic currents based on the Resonance Chiral approach
are available now. This was achieved for more than 88% of the total tau
hadronic width. (ii) the TAUOLA universal interface based on HepMC (the C++
event record) is available. This is the case for C++ users of PHOTOS Monte
Carlo for radiative corrections in decays, as well. An algorithm for weighted
events to explore spin effects in analysis of hard processes was prepared.
(iii) Kernels featuring a complete first-order matrix element are available now
for PHOTOS users interested in decays of Z and W bosons. New tests with
different options of matrix elements for those and for Kl3 decays are available
as well. Presented results illustrate the status of the projects performed in

O(n^((d-2)/d) / log n) communication rounds is presented. For the special case
that M_d is a triangle, we present a probabilistic algorithm that requires an
expected O(ceil(n^(1/3) / (t^(2/3) + 1))) rounds of communication, where t is
the number of triangles in the graph, and O(min{n^(1/3) log^(2/3) n / (t^(2/3)

  We also present deterministic algorithms specially suited for sparse graphs.
In any graph of maximum degree Delta, we can test for arbitrary subgraphs of
diameter D in O(ceil(Delta^(D+1) / n)) rounds. For triangles, we devise an
algorithm featuring a round complexity of O(A^2 / n + log_(2+n/A^2) n), where A

investigators have repeatedly observed a so-called ""wisdom of crowds"" effect,
which roughly says that the average of participants performs much better than
the average participant. The market price---an average or at least aggregate of
traders' beliefs---offers a better estimate than most any individual trader's
opinion. In this paper, we ask a stronger question: how does the market price
compare to the best trader's belief, not just the average trader. We measure
the market's worst-case log regret, a notion common in machine learning theory.
To arrive at a meaningful answer, we need to assume something about how traders
behave. We suppose that every trader optimizes according to the Kelly criteria,
a strategy that provably maximizes the compound growth of wealth over an
(infinite) sequence of market interactions. We show several consequences.
First, the market prediction is a wealth-weighted average of the individual
participants' beliefs. Second, the market learns at the optimal rate, the
market price reacts exactly as if updating according to Bayes' Law, and the
market prediction has low worst-case log regret to the best individual
participant. We simulate a sequence of markets where an underlying true
probability exists, showing that the market converges to the true objective
frequency as if updating a Beta distribution, as the theory predicts. If agents
adopt a fractional Kelly criteria, a common practical variant, we show that
agents behave like full-Kelly agents with beliefs weighted between their own
and the market's, and that the market price converges to a time-discounted
frequency. Our analysis provides a new justification for fractional Kelly
betting, a strategy widely used in practice for ad-hoc reasons. Finally, we
propose a method for an agent to learn her own optimal Kelly fraction.

results showing that this scenario could account for the short baseline and
reactor anomalies and is consistent with the observed masses and mixings of the
three active neutrinos. We also show that this scenario could arise naturally
from an effective theory containing a TeV-scale VEV, which could be related to
other TeV-scale physics. The minimal version of the mini-seesaw relates the
active-sterile mixings to five real parameters and favors an inverted
hierarchy. It has the interesting property that the effective Majorana mass for
neutrinoless double beta decay vanishes, while the effective masses relevant to
tritium beta decay and to cosmology are respectively around 0.2 and 2.4 eV. The
second scenario contains only one eV-scale sterile neutrino but with an
effective non-unitary mixing matrix between the light sterile and active
neutrinos. We find that though this may explain the anomalies, if the
non-unitarity originates from a heavy sterile neutrino with a large
(fine-tuned) mixing angle, this scenario is highly constrained by cosmological

sufficient.
  Our result holds for so-called simple PO-checkable graph optimisation

vertex covers, edge covers, matchings, independent sets, dominating sets, and
edge dominating sets. We focus on the case of bounded-degree graphs and show
that if a local algorithm finds a constant-factor approximation of a simple

(KPCA) combined with k = 1 nearest neighbour algorithm (1NN) as a framework for

light curve is classified one at a time. This allows us to update the principal

method provide good purity results in all data sample analysed, when
SNR$\geq$5. As a consequence, we can state that if a sample as the post-SNPCC
was available today, we would be able to classify $\approx 15%$ of the initial
data set with purity $\gtrsim$ 90% (D$_{7}$+SNR3). Results from the original
SNPCC sample, reported as a function of redshift, show that our method provides
high purity (up to $\approx 97%$), specially in the range of $0.2\leq z < 0.4$,
when compared to results from the SNPCC, while maintaining a moderate figure of
merit ($\approx 0.25$). We also present results for SNe photometric
classification using only pre-maximum epochs, obtaining 63% purity and 77%
successful classification rates (SNR$\geq$5). Results are sensitive to the
information contained in each light curve, as a consequence, higher quality
data points lead to higher successful classification rates. The method is
flexible enough to be applied to other astrophysical transients, as long as a

regime is considered when the likelihood function of the observation time
stamps is Gaussian, exponential or log-normally distributed. A parametrized
solution to the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation of clock offset, based on
convex optimization, is presented, which differs from the earlier approaches
where the likelihood function is maximized graphically. In order to capture the
imperfections in node oscillators, which may render a time-varying nature to
the clock offset, a novel Bayesian approach to the clock offset estimation is
proposed by using a factor graph representation of the posterior density.
Message passing using the max-product algorithm yields a closed form expression
for the Bayesian inference problem. Several lower bounds on the variance of an
estimator are derived for arbitrary exponential family distributed likelihood
functions which, while serving as stepping stones to benchmark the performance
of the proposed clock offset estimators, can be useful in their own right in
classical as well Bayesian parameter estimation theory. To corroborate the
theoretical findings, extensive simulation results are discussed for classical
as well as Bayesian estimators in various scenarios. It is observed that the
performance of the proposed estimators is fairly close to the fundamental
limits established by the lower bounds.

biases related to dust reddening. No SN Ia cosmological results have yet made a
correction for the ""velocity-color"" relation. To test the existence of such a
relation and constrain its properties at high redshift, we examine a sample of
75 SNe Ia discovered and observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-II (SDSS-II)

measure ejecta velocities at maximum brightness for the Ca H&K and Si II 6355
features, v_Ca^0 and v_Si^0, respectively. Using SN light-curve parameters, we
determine the intrinsic B_max - V_max for each SN. Similar to what was found at
low-redshift, we find that SNe Ia with higher ejecta velocity tend to be
intrinsically redder than SNe Ia with lower ejecta velocity. The distributions
of ejecta velocities for SNe Ia at low and high redshift are similar,
indicating that current cosmological results should have little bias related to
the velocity-color relation. Additionally, we find a slight (2.4-sigma
significant) trend between SN Ia ejecta velocity and host-galaxy mass such that
SNe Ia in high-mass host galaxies tend to have lower ejecta velocities as
probed by v_Ca^0. These results emphasize the importance of spectroscopy for SN

affected by our ignorance of other cosmological parameters, including the
curvature of the universe, running of the spectral index, primordial helium
abundance, evolving late-time dark energy, and early dark energy. In a combined
analysis of the effective number of neutrinos and sum of neutrino masses, we
find mild (2.2 sigma) preference for additional light degrees of freedom.
However, the effective number of neutrinos is consistent with the canonical
expectation of 3 massive neutrinos and no extra relativistic species to within
1 sigma when allowing for evolving dark energy and relaxing the strong
inflation prior on the curvature and running. The agreement improves with the
possibility of an early dark energy component, itself constrained to be less
than 5% of the critical density (95% CL) in our expanded parameter space. In
extensions of the standard cosmological model, the derived amplitude of linear
matter fluctuations sigma_8 is found to closely agree with low-redshift cluster
abundance measurements. The sum of neutrino masses is robust to assumptions of
the effective number of neutrinos, late-time dark energy, curvature, and
running at the level of 1.2 eV (95% CL). The upper bound degrades to 2.0 eV
(95% CL) when further including the early dark energy density and primordial
helium abundance as additional free parameters. Even in extended cosmological

that the usual quadratic action is renormalizable but is not unitary because of
the presence of a ghost in the theory (pole with negative residue in the
propagator). The new theory is instead ghost-free since an entire function (or
form factor) is introduced in the model without involving new poles in the
propagator. The local high derivative theory is recovered expanding the entire
functions to the lowest order in the mass scale of the theory. Any truncation
of the entire function gives rise to unitarity violation. The theory is
divergent at one loop and finite from two loops upwards: the theory is then
super-renormalizable. Using the modified graviton propagator, we demonstrate
the regularity of the gravitational potential in r=0.

understanding cosmic reionization and galaxy formation. Two common
complementary approaches are Lyman-Break-Galaxy (LBG) surveys for large samples
and Gamma-Ray-Burst (GRB) observations for sensitivity to SFR in small
galaxies. The z>4 GRB-inferred SFR is higher than the LBG rate, but this
difference is difficult to understand, as both methods rely on several modeling
assumptions. Using a physically motivated galaxy luminosity function model,
with star formation in dark-matter halos with virial temperature Tvir>2e4 K
(M_DM>2e8 M_sun), we show that GRB and LBG-derived SFRs are consistent if GRBs
extend to faint galaxies (M_AB<-11). To test star formation below the detection
limit L_lim~0.05L^*_{z=3} of LBG surveys, we propose to measure the fraction
f_det(L>L_lim,z) of GRB hosts with L>L_lim. This fraction quantifies the
missing star formation fraction in LBG surveys, constraining the
mass-suppression scale for galaxy formation, with weak dependence on modeling
assumptions. Because f_det(L>L_lim,z) corresponds to the ratio of star
formation rates derived from LBG and GRB surveys, if these estimators are
unbiased, measuring f_det(L>L_lim,z) also constrains the redshift evolution of
the GRB production rate per unit mass of star formation. Our analysis predicts
significant success for GRB host detections at z~5 with f_det(L>L_lim,z)~0.4,
but rarer detections at z>6. By analyzing the upper limits on host-galaxy
luminosities of six z>5 GRBs from literature data, we infer that galaxies with
M_AB>-15 were present at z>5 at 95% confidence, demonstrating the key role
played by very faint galaxies during reionization.

a debated issue. Theoretical models predict that self-incompatibility systems
break down according to the intensity of inbreeding depression and number of
S-alleles. Other studies have explored the function of asexual reproduction in
the maintenance of self-incompatibility. However, the population genetics of
partially asexual, self-incompatible populations are poorly understood and
previous studies have failed to consider all possible effects of asexual
reproduction or could only speculate on those effects. In this study, we
investigated how partial asexuality may affect genetic diversity at the S-locus
and fitness in small self-incompatible populations. A genetic model including
an S-locus and a viability locus was developed to perform forward simulations
of the evolution of populations of various sizes. Drift combined with partial
asexuality produced a decrease in the number of alleles at the S-locus. In
addition, an excess of heterozygotes was present in the population, causing an
increase in mutation load. This heterozygote excess was enhanced by the
self-incompatibility system in small populations. In addition, in highly
asexual populations, individuals produced asexually had some fitness advantages
over individuals produced sexually, because sexual reproduction produces
homozygotes of the deleterious allele, contrary to asexual reproduction. Our
results suggest that future research on the function of asexuality for the
maintenance of self-incompatibility will need to (1) account for whole-genome
fitness (mutation load generated by asexuality, self-incompatibility and drift)
and (2) acknowledge that the maintenance of self-incompatibility may not be
independent of the maintenance of sex itself.

In the fully nonhomogeneous case, we establish the local well-posedness in

large data with positive initial temperature. Our analysis strongly relies on
the use of a modified divergence-free velocity which allows to reduce the
system to a nonlinear coupling between a parabolic equation and some
evolutionary Stokes system. The Lebesgue exponents of the Besov spaces for the

to consider initial data in Besov spaces with a negative index of regularity.

assuming that such rates decay exponentially with the distance that separates
the individuals. Such distribution is also considered for the ER and BA models,
where we observe topological effects on the correlations. In the case of the

directly proportional to the seat availability. Among both the theoretical and

heating commences when the planet is hot (high entropy); and second, that it
commences after the planet has cooled. In the former case, we use analytical
scalings and numerical experiments to confirm that Ohmic heating is capable of
suspending the cooling as long as a few percent of the stellar irradiation is
converted into Ohmic heating, and the planet has a surface wind that extends to
pressures of ~10 bar or deeper. For these parameters, the radii at which
cooling is stalled are consistent with (or larger than) the observed radii of
most planets. The only two exceptions are WASP-17b and HAT-P-32b. In contrast
to the high entropy case, we show that Ohmic heating cannot significantly
re-inflate planets after they have already cooled. This leads us to suggest
that the diversity of radii observed in hot jupiters may be partially explained

the SZ effect in the hot galaxy cluster RX J1347.5-1145 with Z-Spec, an R ~ 300
grating spectrometer sensitive between 185 and 305 GHz. These data comprise a
high spectral resolution measurement around the null of the SZ effect and
clearly exhibit the transition from negative to positive dT_CMB over the Z-Spec
band. The SZ null position is measured to be nu_0 = 225.8 \pm 2.5 (stat.) \pm
1.2 (sys.) GHz, which differs from the canonical null frequency by 3.0 sigma
and is evidence for modifications to the canonical thermal SZ effect shape.
Assuming the measured shift in nu_0 is due only to relativistic corrections to
the SZ spectrum, we place the limit T_e = 17.1 \pm 5.3 keV from the zero-point
measurement alone. By simulating the response of the instrument to the sky, we
are able to generate likelihood functions in {y_0, T_e, v_pec} space. For v_pec
= 0 km/s, we measure the best fitting SZ model to be y_0 = 4.6 (+0.6, -0.9) x
10^-4, T_e,0 = 15.2 (+12,-7.4) keV. When v_pec is allowed to vary, a most
probable value of v_pec = +450 \pm 810 km/s is found.

focus of Working Group 2 of this workshop was to evaluate how the different
linac options being considered impact the potential realization of Muon

group charge was, ""to investigate the use of a multi-megawatt proton linac to
target, phase rotate and collect muons to support a muon collider and neutrino

identified early on, to serve as a reference: 1) What are the proton source
requirements for muon colliders and neutrino factories? 2) What are the issues
with respect to realizing the required muon collider and neutrino factory
proton sources? a. General considerations b. Considerations specific to the two
linac configurations identified by Project-X. 3) What things need to be done
before we can be reasonably confident that ICD1/ICD2 can be upgraded to provide
the neutrino factory / muon collider needs? A number of presentations were
given, and are available at the workshop web-site. This paper does not
summarize the individual presentations, but rather addresses overall findings

measure the average X-ray properties of the ETG population, we use X-ray
stacking analyses with a subset of 158 passive ETGs (148 of which were
individually undetected in X-ray). This ETG subset was constructed to span the
redshift ranges of z = 0.1-1.2 in the ~4 Ms CDF-S and ~2 Ms CDF-N and z =
0.1-0.6 in the ~250 ks E-CDF-S where the contribution from individually
undetected AGNs is expected to be negligible in our stacking. We find that 55
of the ETGs are detected individually in the X-rays, and 12 of these galaxies
have properties consistent with being passive hot-gas dominated systems (i.e.,
systems not dominated by an X-ray bright Active Galactic Nucleus; AGN). On the
basis of our analyses, we find little evolution in the mean 0.5-2 keV to B-band
luminosity ratio (L_X/L_B proportional to [1 + z]^1.2) since z~1.2, implying
that some heating mechanism prevents the gas from cooling in these systems. We
consider that feedback from radio-mode AGN activity could be responsible for
heating the gas. We select radio AGNs in the ETG population using their
far-infrared/radio flux ratio. Our radio observations allow us to constrain the
duty cycle history of radio AGN activity in our ETG sample. We estimate that if
scaling relations between radio and mechanical power hold out to z~1.2 for the
ETG population being studied here, the average mechanical power from AGN
activity is a factor of ~1.4-2.6 times larger than the average radiative
cooling power from hot gas over the redshift range z~0-1.2. The excess of
inferred AGN mechanical power from these ETGs is consistent with that found in
the local Universe for similar types of galaxies.

terminations of alumina bond with graphene, leading to the opening of a band
gap. Significant charge transfer is seen between the graphene layer and the
oxide in the latter cases. Additionally, we review the work of others regarding
the effect of various substrates on the electronic properties of graphene.
Confining graphene to form nanoribbons also results in the opening of a band

measure for gene equivalence. It is common practice in genome-wide studies to
rank genes according to observed gene-specific P-values or adjusted P-values,
which are assumed to measure the strength of evidence against the null
hypothesis of no differential gene expression. We show here, both empirically
and formally, that the equivalence P-value does not satisfy the basic
consistency requirements for a valid strength of evidence measure for
equivalence. This means that the widely-used q-value (Storey, 2002) defined for
each gene to be the minimum positive false discovery rate that would result in
the inclusion of the corresponding P-value in the discovery set, cannot be
translated to the equivalence testing framework. However, when represented as a
posterior probability, we find that the q-value does satisfy some basic
consistency requirements needed to be a credible measure of evidence for
equivalence. We propose a simple estimate for the q-value from posterior
probabilities of equivalence, and analyse data from a mouse stem cell
microarray experiment which demonstrate the theory and methods presented here.

owing to weaker influence of pinning in high-quality crystals. Related
indicators for pinning perturbations such as non-monotonic H dependence of

anomalies in c-axis components of {\sigma}, which reflect nodeless gap

amplitude maximum (antinode) of a surface standing wave. A few identical
floaters therefore organize into antinode clusters. However, beyond a
transitional value of the floater concentration $\phi$, we observe that the
same spheres spontaneously accumulate at the nodal lines, completely inverting
the self-organized particle pattern on the wave. From a potential energy
estimate we show (i) that at low $\phi$ antinode clusters are energetically
favorable over nodal ones and (ii) how this situation reverses at high $\phi$,
in agreement with the experiment.

relaxing the condition on the local particle dimension. The resulting code is
well-defined when the local Hilbert space dimension is prime. These codes can
be divided into two different classes: the local stabilizer generators are
either symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to the inversion operation.
These is a nontrivial correspondence between these two classes. For any
symmetric code without string logical operator, there exists a complementary
antisymmetric code with the same property and vice versa. We derive a
sufficient condition for the absence of string logical operator in terms of the

fluid due to diffusion of photons inevitably creates spectral distortions in
the CMB. With the proposed CMB experiment PIXIE it might become possible to
measure these distortions and thereby constrain the primordial power spectrum
at comoving wavenumbers 50 Mpc^{-1} < k < 10^4 Mpc^{-1}. Since primordial
fluctuations in the CMB on these scales are completely erased by Silk damping,
these distortions may provide the only way to shed light on otherwise
unobservable aspects of inflationary physics. A consistent treatment of the
primordial dissipation problem requires going to second order in perturbation
theory, while thermalization of these distortions necessitates consideration of
second order in Compton scattering energy transfer. Here we give a full 2x2
treatment for the creation and evolution of spectral distortions due to the
acoustic dissipation process, consistently including the effect of polarization
and photon mixing in the free streaming regime. We show that 1/3 of the total
energy (9/4 larger than previous estimates) stored in small-scale temperature
perturbations imprints observable spectral distortions, while the remaining 2/3
only raises the average CMB temperature, an effect that is unobservable. At
high redshift dissipation is mainly mediated through the quadrupole
anisotropies, while after recombination peculiar motions are most important.
During recombination the damping of the higher multipoles is also significant.
We compute the average distortion for several examples using CosmoTherm,
analyzing their dependence on parameters of the primordial power spectrum. For
one of the best fit WMAP7 cosmologies, with n_S=1.027 and n_run=-0.034, the
cooling of baryonic matter practically compensates the heating from acoustic
dissipation in the mu-era. (abridged)

by the advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAF), in which collisions among
the clumps are neglected. We start from the collisionless Boltzmann equation
and assume that interaction between the clumps and the ADAF is responsible for
transporting angular momentum of clumps outward. The inner edge of the
clumpy-ADAF is set to be the tidal radius of the clumps. We consider strong and
weak coupling cases, in which the averaged properties of clumps follow the ADAF
dynamics and mainly determined by the black hole potential, respectively. We
get the analytical solution of the dynamics of clumps for the two cases. The
velocity dispersion of clumps is one magnitude higher than the ADAF for the
strong coupling case. For the weak coupling case, we find that the mean radial
velocity of clumps is linearly proportional to the coefficient of the drag
force. We show that the tidally disrupted clumps would lead to accumulation of
the debris to form a debris disk in the Shakura-Sunyaev regime. The entire hot
ADAF will be efficiently cooled down by photons from the debris disk, giving
rise to collapse of the ADAF and quench the clumpy accretion. Subsequently,
evaporation of the collapsed ADAF drives resuscitate of a new clumpy-ADAF,
resulting in an oscillation of the global clumpy-ADAF. Applications of the
present model are briefly discussed to X-ray binaries, ionization nuclear

dominated accretion disk in quasars. The warm skins of the SF disk are governed
by the radiation from the inner part of the accretion disk to form Compton
atmosphere (CAS). The CAS are undergoing four phases to form broad line
regions. Phase I is the duration of pure accumulation supplied by the SF disk.
During phase II clouds begin to form due to line cooling and sink to the SF
disk. Phase III is a period of preventing clouds from sinking to the SF disk
through dynamic interaction between clouds and the CAS. Finally, phase IV is an
inevitable collapse of the entire CAS through line cooling. This CAS evolution
drives the episodic appearance of BLRs. Geometry and dynamics of BLRs can be
self-consistently derived from the thermal instability of the CAS during phases
II and III by linear analysis. The metallicity gradient of SF disk gives rise
to different properties of clouds from outer to inner part of BLRs. We find
that clouds have column density N_H < 10^22cm^{-2} in the metal-rich regions
whereas they have N_H > 10^22 cm^{-2} in the metal-poor regions. The metal-rich
clouds compose the high ionization line (HIL) regions whereas the metal-poor
clouds are in low ionization line (LIL) regions. Metal-rich clouds in HIL
regions will be blown away by radiation pressure, forming the observed
outflows. The LIL regions are episodic due to the mass cycle of clouds with the
CAS in response to continuous injection by the SF disk, giving rise to
different types of AGNs. Based on SDSS quasar spectra, we identify a spectral
sequence in light of emission line equivalent width from Phase I to IV. A key
phase in the episodic appearance of the BLRs is bright type II AGNs with no or
only weak BLRs. We discuss observational implications and tests of the
theoretical predictions of this model.

coronal energy using the number of field lines connecting regions of positive
and negative photospheric flux. This information is quantified by the net flux
connecting pairs of opposing regions in a connectivity matrix. Changes in the
coronal magnetic field, due to processes such as magnetic reconnection,
manifest themselves as changes in the connectivity matrix. However, the
connectivity matrix will also change when flux sources emerge or submerge
through the photosphere, as often happens in active regions. We have developed
an algorithm to estimate the changes in flux due to emergence and submergence
of magnetic flux sources. These estimated changes must be accounted for in
order to quantify storage and release of magnetic energy in the corona. To
perform this calculation over extended periods of time, we must additionally
have a consistently labeled connectivity matrix over the entire observational
time span. We have therefore developed an automated tracking algorithm to
generate a consistent connectivity matrix as the photospheric source regions
evolve over time. We have applied this method to NOAA Active Region 11112,

Submitted to ACS - Advances in Complex Systems",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose a framework inspired by interacting particle physics
and devised to perform clustering on multidimensional datasets. To this end,
any given dataset is modeled as an interacting particle system, under the
assumption that each element of the dataset corresponds to a different particle
and that particle interactions are rendered through gaussian potentials.
Moreover, the way particle interactions are evaluated depends on a parameter
that controls the shape of the underlying gaussian model. In principle,
different clusters of proximal particles can be identified, according to the
value adopted for the parameter. This degree of freedom in gaussian potentials
has been introduced with the goal of allowing multiresolution analysis. In
particular, upon the adoption of a standard community detection algorithm,
multiresolution analysis is put into practice by repeatedly running the
algorithm on a set of adjacency matrices, each dependent on a specific value of
the parameter that controls the shape of gaussian potentials. As a result,
different partitioning schemas are obtained on the given dataset, so that the
information thereof can be better highlighted, with the goal of identifying the
most appropriate number of clusters. Solutions achieved in synthetic datasets
allowed to identify a repetitive pattern, which appear to be useful in the task
of identifying optimal solutions while analysing other synthetic and real

the theory's first-principles prediction of a wide range of internal STZ

Newtonian viscosity to be strongly temperature dependent; and I propose that it
is this temperature dependence, rather than any heterogeneity-induced
enhancement of diffusion, that is responsible for Stokes-Einstein violations
near $T_g$. I also show that stretched-exponential relaxation of density
fluctuations emerges naturally from the same distribution of STZ transition
rates that predicts the viscoelastic behavior. To be consistent with

SDSS DR7 LRG sample, sharpening the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature
and achieving a 1.9% measurement of the distance to z=0.35. This is the first
application of reconstruction of the BAO feature in a galaxy redshift survey.
We update the reconstruction algorithm of Eisenstein et al, 2007 to account for
the effects of survey geometry as well as redshift-space distortions and
validate it on 160 LasDamas simulations. We demonstrate that reconstruction
sharpens the BAO feature in the angle averaged galaxy correlation function,
reducing the nonlinear smoothing scale \Sigma_nl from 8.1 Mpc/h to 4.4 Mpc/h.
Reconstruction also significantly reduces the effects of redshift-space
distortions at the BAO scale, isotropizing the correlation function. This
sharpened BAO feature yields an unbiased distance estimate (< 0.2%) and reduces
the scatter from 3.3% to 2.1%. We demonstrate the robustness of these results
to the various reconstruction parameters, including the smoothing scale, the
galaxy bias and the linear growth rate. Applying this reconstruction algorithm
to the SDSS LRG DR7 sample improves the significance of the BAO feature in
these data from 3.3 sigma for the unreconstructed correlation function, to 4.2
sigma after reconstruction. We estimate a relative distance scale D_V/r_s to
z=0.35 of 8.88+/-0.17, where r_s is the sound horizon and D_V = (D_A^2/H)^{1/3}

In particular, it is not known if isentropic gas dynamics admits an a priori

  In this paper we consider strictly hyperbolic $2\times 2$-systems and derive
a representation result for scalar fields that are TVD across all pairwise wave

function (PSF), detector pixelization, and observing strategy. The PSF and
pixel response describe the spatial blurring of the source, the pixel scale
describes the spatial sampling of a single exposure, and the observing strategy
determines the set of dithered exposures with pointing offsets from which the
source flux is inferred. In a wide-field imaging survey, sources of interest
are randomly distributed within the field of view and hence are centered
randomly within a pixel. A given hardware configuration and observing strategy
therefore have a distribution of photometric uncertainty for sources of fixed
flux that fall in the field. In this article we explore the ensemble behavior
of photometric and position accuracies for different PSFs, pixel scales, and
dithering patterns. We find that the average uncertainty in the flux
determination depends slightly on dither strategy, whereas the position
determination can be strongly dependent on the dithering. For cases with pixels
much larger than the PSF, the uncertainty distributions can be non-Gaussian,
with rms values that are particularly sensitive to the dither strategy. We also
find that for these configurations with large pixels, pointings dithered by a
fractional pixel amount do not always give minimal average uncertainties; this
is in contrast to image reconstruction for which fractional dithers are
optimal. When fractional pixel dithering is favored, a pointing accuracy of
better than $\sim 0.15$ pixel width is required to maintain half the advantage
over random dithers.

the frequencies of their luminosity variations are modulated by the Doppler
effect caused by orbital motion. For each pulsation frequency this manifests
itself as a multiplet separated by the orbital frequency in the Fourier
transform of the light curve of the star. We derive the theoretical relations
to exploit data from the Fourier transform to derive all the parameters of a
binary system traditionally extracted from spectroscopic radial velocities,
including the mass function which is easily derived from the amplitude ratio of
the first orbital sidelobes to the central frequency for each pulsation
frequency. This is a new technique that yields radial velocities from the
Doppler shift of a pulsation frequency, thus eliminates the need to obtain
spectra. For binary stars with pulsating components, an orbital solution can be
obtained from the light curve alone. We give a complete derivation of this and
demonstrate it both with artificial data, and with a case of a hierarchical
eclipsing binary with {\it Kepler} mission data, KIC 4150611 (HD 181469). We
show that it is possible to detect Jupiter-mass planets orbiting $\delta$ Sct

numerically analyse virus dynamics and humoral response in a host during
primary and secondary dengue infection for long periods using micro-epidemic

enhancement (ADE), a dynamic switch and a correlation factor between different
DENV serotypes. We find that the viral load goes down to undetectable levels

primary infection, the stability analysis of steady states shows interesting
dependence on the time delay involved in the production of antibodies from
plasma cells. We demonstrate the existence of a critical value for the immune
response parameter, beyond which the infection gets completely cured. For
secondary infections with a different serotype, the homologous antibody
production is enhanced due to the influence of heterologous antibodies. The
antibody production is also controlled by the correlation factor, which is a
measure of similarities between the different DENV serotypes involved. Our
results agree with clinically observed humoral responses for primary and

have been mosaic imaged at a radio frequency of 1.4 GHz with $6\arcsec$ angular
resolution and 72 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ rms noise. The images (centered at RA:
$00^{h}\ 35^{m}\ 00^{s}$, DEC: $-67^{\circ}\ 00^{'}\ 00^{""}$ and RA: $00^{h}\
59^{m}\ 17^{s}$, DEC: $-67^{\circ}\ 00^{'}\ 00^{""}$ (J2000 epoch)) cover 8.42
square degrees sky area and have no artifacts or imaging errors above the image
thermal noise. Multi-resolution radio and optical r-band images (made using the
4-m CTIO Blanco telescope) were used to recognize multi-component sources and
prepare a source list; the detection threshold was 0.38 mJy in a low resolution
radio image made with beam FWHM of $50\arcsec$. Radio source counts in the flux
density range 0.4-8.7 mJy are estimated, with corrections applied for noise
bias, effective area correction and resolution bias. The resolution bias is
mitigated using low resolution radio images, while effects of source confusion
are removed by using high resolution images for identifying blended sources.
Below 1 mJy the ATLBS counts are systematically lower than the previous
estimates. Showing no evidence for an upturn down to 0.4 mJy, they do not
require any changes in the radio source population down to the limit of the
survey. The work suggests that automated image analysis for counts may be
dependent on the ability of the imaging to reproduce connecting emission with
low surface brightness and on the ability of the algorithm to recognize
sources, which may require that source finding algorithms effectively work with
multi-resolution and multi-wavelength data. The work underscores the importance
of using source lists-as opposed to component lists-and correcting for the
noise bias in order to precisely estimate counts close to the image noise and
determine the upturn at sub-mJy flux density.

decidability in doubly exponential alternating time with linearly many

uniformly decidable on level 2 collapsible pushdown graphs. Moreover, nested
pushdown trees are first-order interpretable in collapsible pushdown graphs of
level 2. This interpretation can be extended to an interpretation of the class
of higher-order nested pushdown trees in the collapsible pushdown graph

it is known that the no-signaling polytope is the polyhedral dual (polar) of
the Bell polytope. Computational evidence suggests that this duality also holds
for three parties. Using ideas of Werner, Wolf, \.Zukowski and Brukner, we
prove this for any number of parties by describing a simple linear bijection
mapping (tight) Bell inequalities to (extremal) no-signaling boxes and vice
versa. Furthermore, a symmetry-based technique for extending Bell inequalities
(resp. no-signaling boxes) with two binary observables from n parties to n+1
parties is described; the Mermin-Klyshko family of Bell inequalities arises in
this way, as well as 11 of the 46 classes of tight Bell inequalities for 3
parties. Finally, we ask whether the set of quantum correlations is self-dual
with respect to our transformation. We find this not to be the case in general,
although it holds for 2 parties on the level of correlations. This self-duality
implies Tsirelson's bound for the CHSH inequality.

effect. Consequently the whole system is separated into two bulk regions like

local charge neutrality is approximately attained, so that the equation of

that there is no possibility for the density discontinuity to appear in

features are important when considering astrophysical phenomena such as
supernova explosions or radiation of the gravitational wave from protoneutron

by the spatially averaged pair-potential, which is purely harmonic in the de

lattice generate, at low temperatures, large erratically oscillating (i.e.

dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), loaded into a deep one-dimensional
(1D) optical lattice (OL), by means of analytical and numerical methods in the
tight-binding limit. The patterns featuring multiple periodicities are
generated by the modulational instability of the continuous-wave (CW) state,
whose period is identical to that of the OL. The DPP and TPP emerge via phase
transitions of the second and first kind, respectively. The emerging patterns
may be stable provided that the dipole-dipole (DD) interactions are repulsive
and sufficiently strong, in comparison with the local repulsive nonlinearity.
Within the set of the considered states, the TPPs realize a minimum of the free
energy. Accordingly, a vast stability region for the TPPs is found in the
parameter space, while the DPP\ stability region is relatively narrow. The same
mechanism may create stable density-wave patterns in other physical media
featuring nonlocal interactions, such as arrayed optical waveguides with

the distance scale issue, as the relations have potential to derive the Hubble

Consequently, we have derived the MIR P-L relations for Cepheids in the Large

We also compared currently empirical P-L relations for Cepheids in the
Magellanic Clouds to the synthetic MIR P-L relations derived from pulsational
models. For the study of multi-phase P-L relations, we present convincing
evidence that the Cepheid P-L relations in the Magellanic Clouds are highly
dynamic quantities that vary significantly when considered as a function of
pulsational phase. We found that there is a difference in P-L relations as a
function of phase between the Cepheids in each of the Clouds; the most likely
cause for this is the metallicity difference between the two galaxies. We also
investigated the dispersion of the multi-phase P-L relations, and found that
the minimum dispersion do not differ significantly from the mean light P-L

existence could have considerable implications for the strong-CP problem of QCD
as well as the dark matter problem in cosmology. Specifically, such light
bosons may be detected with a much greater sensitivity, over a broad particle
mass range, than is currently achievable by terrestrial experiments, and using
indirect astrophysical considerations. The observable effect was discussed in
Chelouche & Guendelman (2009), and is akin to the Stern-Gerlach experiment: the
splitting of a photon beam naturally arises when finite coupling exists between
the electro-magnetic field and the axion field. The splitting angle of the
light beams linearly depends on the photon wavelength, the size of the
magnetized region, and the magnetic field gradient in the transverse direction
to the propagation direction of the photons. If radio emission in radio-loud
magnetars is beamed and originates in regions with strong magnetic field
gradients, then splitting of individual pulses may be detectable. We quantify
the effect for a simplified model for magnetars, and search for radio beam
splitting in the 2\,GHz radio light curves of the radio loud magnetar

polynomial interpolation. The polynomial interpolant is expressed in terms of
function values using the so-called barycentric weights, which depend on the
interpolation points. Few explicit formulae for these barycentric weights are
known. In [H. Wang and S. Xiang, Math. Comp., 81 (2012), 861--877], the authors
have shown that the barycentric weights of the roots of Legendre polynomials
can be expressed explicitly in terms of the weights of the corresponding
Gaussian quadrature rule. This idea was subsequently implemented in the Chebfun
package [L. N. Trefethen and others, The Chebfun Development Team, 2011] and in
the process generalized by the Chebfun authors to the roots of Jacobi, Laguerre
and Hermite polynomials. In this paper, we explore the generality of the link
between barycentric weights and Gaussian quadrature and show that such
relationships are related to the existence of lowering operators for orthogonal
polynomials. We supply an exhaustive list of cases, in which all known formulae
are recovered and also some new formulae are derived, including the barycentric
weights for Gauss-Radau and Gauss-Lobatto points. Based on a fast ${\mathcal
O}(n)$ algorithm for the computation of Gaussian quadrature, due to Hale and
Townsend, this leads to an ${\mathcal O}(n)$ computational scheme for
barycentric weights.

clear lobe structures are observed in visible-light imaging of the X-point
region. These lobes or manifold structures, that were predicted previously,
have been observed for the first time in a range of discharges and their
appearance is correlated with the effect of RMPs on the plasma i.e. they only
appear above a threshold when a density pump out is observed or when the ELM
frequency is increased. They appear to be correlated with the RMPs penetrating
the plasma and may be important in explaining why the ELM frequency increases.
The number and location of the structures observed can be well described using
vacuum modelling. Differences in radial extent and poloidal width from vacuum
modelling are likely to be due to a combination of transport effects and plasma
screening.

locally, are potential locations for energy conversion in the solar corona. The
fact that the magnetic field is identically zero at these points suggests that
for the study of current sheet formation and of any subsequent resistive
dissipation phase, a finite beta plasma should be considered, rather than
neglecting the plasma pressure as has often been the case in the past. The
rapid dissipation of a finite current layer in non-force-free equilibrium is
investigated numerically, after the sudden onset of an anomalous resistivity.
The aim of this study is to determine how the energy is redistributed during
the initial diffusion phase, and what is the nature of the outward transmission
of information and energy. The resistivity rapidly diffuses the current at the
null point. The presence of a plasma pressure allows the vast majority of the
free energy to be transferred into internal energy. Most of the converted
energy is used in direct heating of the surrounding plasma, and only about 3%
is converted into kinetic energy, causing a perturbation in the magnetic field
and the plasma which propagates away from the null at the local fast
magnetoacoustic speed. The propagating pulses show a complex structure due to
the highly non-uniform initial state. It is shown that this perturbation
carries no net current as it propagates away from the null. The fact that,
under the assumptions taken in this paper, most of the magnetic energy released
in the reconnection converts internal energy of the plasma, may be highly
important for the chromospheric and coronal heating problem.

settles a conjecture by Zheng & Tse (2002) in the affirmative. The
capacity-achieving input signal, which we refer to as Beta-variate space-time

polynomial map to an algebraic variety. This is of first importance since the
global minimum of such a map is reached at a critical point. Thus, these points
appear naturally in non-convex polynomial optimization which occurs in a wide
range of scientific applications (control theory, chemistry, economics,...).
Critical points also play a central role in recent algorithms of effective real
algebraic geometry. Experimentally, it has been observed that Gr\""obner basis
algorithms are efficient to compute such points. Therefore, recent software
based on the so-called Critical Point Method are built on Gr\""obner bases
engines. Let $f_1,..., f_p$ be polynomials in $ \Q[x_1,..., x_n]$ of degree
$D$, $V\subset\C^n$ be their complex variety and $\pi_1$ be the projection map
$(x_1,.., x_n)\mapsto x_1$. The critical points of the restriction of $\pi_1$
to $V$ are defined by the vanishing of $f_1,..., f_p$ and some maximal minors
of the Jacobian matrix associated to $f_1,..., f_p$. Such a system is
algebraically structured: the ideal it generates is the sum of a determinantal
ideal and the ideal generated by $f_1,..., f_p$. We provide the first
complexity estimates on the computation of Gr\""obner bases of such systems
defining critical points. We prove that under genericity assumptions on
$f_1,..., f_p$, the complexity is polynomial in the generic number of critical
points, i.e. $D^p(D-1)^{n-p}{{n-1}\choose{p-1}}$. More particularly, in the
quadratic case D=2, the complexity of such a Gr\""obner basis computation is
polynomial in the number of variables $n$ and exponential in $p$. We also give
experimental evidence supporting these theoretical results.

used for example to control the motion of electrons on the atomic scale or to

  Here we discuss a detection scheme for time-resolving high-energy gamma ray

attosecond streak imaging, but instead of conversion of photons into electrons
in a nonlinear medium, the high-energy process of electron-positron pair
creation is utilized. These pairs are produced in vacuum through the collision
of a test pulse to be characterized with an intense laser pulse, and they
acquire additional energy and momentum depending on their phase in the
streaking pulse at the moment of production. A coincidence measurement of the
electron and positron momenta after the interaction provides information on the
pair production phase within the streaking pulse. We examine the limitations
imposed by quantum radiation reaction in multiphoton Compton scattering on this
detection scheme, and discuss other necessary conditions to render the scheme
feasible in the upcoming Extreme Light Infrastructure (ELI) laser facility.

structures in the Universe. As predicted by General Relativity, given their
masses, clusters strongly deform space-time in their vicinity. Clusters act as
some of the most powerful gravitational lenses in the Universe. Light rays
traversing through clusters from distant sources are hence deflected, and the
resulting images of these distant objects therefore appear distorted and
magnified. Lensing by clusters occurs in two regimes, each with unique
observational signatures. The strong lensing regime is characterized by effects
readily seen by eye, namely, the production of giant arcs, multiple-images, and
arclets. The weak lensing regime is characterized by small deformations in the
shapes of background galaxies only detectable statistically. Cluster lenses
have been exploited successfully to address several important current questions
in cosmology: (i) the study of the lens(es) - understanding cluster mass
distributions and issues pertaining to cluster formation and evolution, as well
as constraining the nature of dark matter; (ii) the study of the lensed objects
- probing the properties of the background lensed galaxy population - which is
statistically at higher redshifts and of lower intrinsic luminosity thus
enabling the probing of galaxy formation at the earliest times right up to the
Dark Ages; and (iii) the study of the geometry of the Universe - as the
strength of lensing depends on the ratios of angular diameter distances between
the lens, source and observer, lens deflections are sensitive to the value of
cosmological parameters and offer a powerful geometric tool to probe Dark
Energy. In this review, we present the basics of cluster lensing and provide a
current status report of the field.

coefficients for any number of users, antennas and streams per user; and
propose a polynomial-time test for this problem. Combining algebraic geometry
techniques with differential topology ones, we first prove a result that
generalizes those previously published on this topic. Specifically, we consider
the input set (complex projective space of MIMO interference channels), the
output set (precoder and decoder Grassmannians) and the solution set (channels,
decoders and precoders satisfying the IA polynomial equations), not only as
algebraic sets but also as smooth compact manifolds. Using this mathematical
framework, we prove that the linear alignment problem is feasible when the
algebraic dimension of the solution variety is larger than or equal to the
dimension of the input space and the linear mapping between the tangent spaces
of both smooth manifolds given by the first projection is generically
surjective. If that mapping is not surjective, then the solution variety
projects into the input space in a singular way and the projection is a
zero-measure set. This result naturally yields a simple feasibility test, which
amounts to checking the rank of a matrix. We also provide an exact arithmetic
version of the test, which proves that testing the feasibility of IA for
generic MIMO channels belongs to the bounded-error probabilistic polynomial
(BPP) complexity class.

an interior point in which the three strategies coexist, the corresponding
basin of attraction decreasing with increasing number of players, whereas we
have not been able to locate such a point for n = 5. We analytically show that
in the infinite n limit no interior points can arise. We conclude by discussing
the implications of this theoretical approach on the behavior observed in

to develop an efficient method to in-paint the CMB sky map, while still
preserving statistical properties. In this letter, we consider Monte-Carlo

the highest alignment in the V band map, which has less foreground
contamination than other bands. Therefore, we find it hard to attribute the
alignment to residual foregrounds. Our method will be complementary to other
efforts on in-painting or reconstructing the masked CMB data, and of great use

intricate web of the interactions among the units of the related systems (e.g.,
proteins, computers, people). Consequently, one of the most successful recent
approaches to capturing the fundamental features of the structure and dynamics
of complex systems has been the investigation of the networks associated with
the above units (nodes) together with their relations (edges). Most complex
systems have an inherently hierarchical organization and, correspondingly, the
networks behind them also exhibit hierarchical features. Indeed, several papers
have been devoted to describing this essential aspect of networks, however,
without resulting in a widely accepted, converging concept concerning the
quantitative characterization of the level of their hierarchy. Here we develop
an approach and propose a quantity (measure) which is simple enough to be
widely applicable, reveals a number of universal features of the organization
of real-world networks and, as we demonstrate, is capable of capturing the
essential features of the structure and the degree of hierarchy in a complex
network. The measure we introduce is based on a generalization of the m-reach
centrality, which we first extend to directed/partially directed graphs. Then,
we define the global reaching centrality (GRC), which is the difference between
the maximum and the average value of the generalized reach centralities over
the network. We investigate the behavior of the GRC considering both a
synthetic model with an adjustable level of hierarchy and real networks.
Results for real networks show that our hierarchy measure is related to the
controllability of the given system. We also propose a visualization procedure
for large complex networks that can be used to obtain an overall qualitative
picture about the nature of their hierarchical structure.

the fine-tuning problem are studied. The results are applied to the Standard
Model and Standard Model extension with additional singlet scalar field. The
correlation between the Higgs mass and the scale at which new physics is
expected to occur is studied based on a fine-tuning arguments, such as the
Veltman condition.

quantum dots. The theory is based on the Keldysh field integral in the spin
channel of the quantum dot described by the single impurity Anderson
Hamiltonian. The effective Keldysh action is a functional of the
Hubbard-Stratonovich magnetization field decoupling the quantum dot spin
channel. We expand this action up to the second order with respect to the
magnetization field, which allows to describe nonequilibrium interacting
quantum dots at low temperatures and weak electron-electron interactions,up to
the contacts-dot coupling energy. Besides its simplicity, an additional
advantage of the theory is that it correctly describes the unitary limit giving
the correct result for the conductance maximum. Thus our theory establishes an
alternative simple method relevant for investigation of weakly interacting
nonequilibrium nanodevices.

g_{j,s,lambda}(n - s - g_{j,s,lambda}(n-j)) + \lambda j. For particular choices
of the initial conditions, we show that the solution of the recursion is a
non-slow monotone sequence for which we can provide a combinatorial
interpretation in terms of a weighted count of the leaves of a certain labeled
infinite tree. We discover that more than one such tree interpretation is
possible, leading to different choices of the initial conditions and
alternative solutions that are closely related. In the case lambda=1 the
initial conditions for these alternative tree interpretations coincide and we
derive explicit closed forms for the solution sequence and its frequency
function.

studied in the vicinity of the global stability threshold R_g below which
laminar flow ultimately prevails. Appropriately tailored direct numerical
simulations are performed to manage systems extended enough to accommodate
several bands. The initial state or germ is an oblique turbulent patch of
limited extent. The growth is seen to result from several competing processes:
(i) nucleation of turbulent patches close to or at the extremities of already
formed band segments, with the same obliquity as the germ or the opposite one,
and (ii) turbulence collapse similar to gap formation for band decay. Growth
into a labyrinthine pattern is observed as soon as spanwise expansion is
effective. An ideally aligned pattern is usually obtained at the end of a long
and gradual regularisation stage when R is large enough. Stable isolated bands
can be observed slightly above R_g. When growth rates are not large enough, the
germ decays at the end of a long transient, similar to what was observed in
experiments. Local continuous growth/decay microscopic mechanisms are seen to
compete with large deviations which are the cause of mesoscopic nucleation
events (turbulent patches or laminar gaps) controlling the macroscopic
behaviour of the system (pattern). Implications of these findings are discussed
in the light of Pomeau's proposals based on directed percolation and
first-order phase transitions in statistical physics.
