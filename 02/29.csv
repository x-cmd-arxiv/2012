interest in several applications, such as the estimation of species abundance
distribution in ecology. In this paper we study the least squares estimator of
a discrete distribution under the constraint of convexity. We show that this
estimator exists and is unique, and that it always outperforms the classical
empirical estimator in terms of the $\ell_{2}$-distance. We provide an
algorithm for its computation, based on the support reduction algorithm. We
compare its performance to those of the empirical estimator, on the basis of a
simulation study.

gas-like phase observed for high and low densities, a novel cluster phase is
reported at intermediate densities. This takes the form of a stationary
assembly of dense aggregates, with an average size which grows with activity as
a linear function of the self-propelling velocity. While different possible
scenarii can be considered to account for these observations - such as a
generic velocity weakening instability recently put forward -, we show that the
experimental results are reproduced by a chemotactic aggregation mechanism,
originally introduced to account for bacterial aggregation, and accounting here
for diffusiophoretic chemical interaction between colloidal swimmers.

Given a Neumann-Zagier datum (comprising the shapes together with the gluing
equations in a particular canonical form) we define a formal power series with
coefficients in the invariant trace field of $M$ that should (a) agree with the
asymptotic expansion of the Kashaev invariant to all orders, and (b) contain
the nonabelian Reidemeister-Ray-Singer torsion of $M$ as its first subleading
""1-loop"" term. As a case study, we prove topological invariance of the 1-loop
part of the constructed series and extend it into a formal power series of
rational functions on the $\PSL(2,\BC)$ character variety of $M$. We provide a
computer implementation of the first three terms of the series using the
standard {\tt SnapPy} toolbox and check numerically the agreement of our
torsion with the Reidemeister-Ray-Singer for all 59924 hyperbolic knots with at
most 14 crossings. Finally, we explain how the definition of our series follows
from the quantization of 3d hyperbolic geometry, using principles of
Topological Quantum Field Theory. Our results have a straightforward extension
to any 3-manifold $M$ with torus boundary components (not necessarily
hyperbolic) that admits a regular ideal triangulation with respect to some

stem or progenitor state to a mature cell is critically important. We develop a
theoretical framework to quantify the underlying potential landscape and
biological paths for cell development and differentiation. We propose a new
mechanism of differentiation and development through binding/unbinding of
regulatory proteins to the gene promoters. We found indeed the differentiated
states can emerge from the slow promoter binding/unbinding processes.
Furthermore, under slow promoter binding/unbinding, we found multiple
meta-stable differentiated states. This can explain the origin of multiple
states observed in the recent experiments. In addition, the kinetic time
quantified by mean first passage transition time for the differentiation and
reprogramming strongly depends on the time scale of the promoter
binding/unbinding processes. We discovered an optimal speed for differentiation
for certain binding/unbinding rates of regulatory proteins to promoters. More
experiments in the future might be able to tell if cells differentiate at at
that optimal speed. In addition, we quantify kinetic pathways for the
differentiation and reprogramming. We found that they are irreversible. This
captures the non-equilibrium dynamics in multipotent stem or progenitor cells.
Such inherent time-asymmetry as a result of irreversibility of state transition
pathways as shown may provide the origin of time arrow for cell development.

this end, we consider Ne$^{8+}$ exposed to deterministic and chaotic ensembles
of intense x-ray pulses. The time-dependent configuration-interaction singles
(TDCIS) method is used to quantitatively describe nonlinear ionization of
Ne$^{8+}$ induced by coherent intense ultrashort x-ray laser pulses. The impact
of the bandwidth of a chaotic ensemble of x-ray pulses on the effective
two-photon ionization cross section is studied within the lowest nonvanishing
order of perturbation theory. We find that, at a bandwidth of 11 eV, the

respectively. We show that the enhancement obtained for a chaotic ensemble of
pulses originates from the presence of the one-photon 1$s^2$--1$s4p$ resonance
located at 1127 eV. Using the TDCIS approach, we also show that, for currently
available radiation intensities, two-photon ionization of a 1$s$ electron in

anomalous extinction or variable reddening that could be due to a possible
contamination by dense clouds or circumstellar effects. The extinction law (Rv)
was evaluated by adopting two methods: (i) the use of theoretical expressions
based on the colour-excess of stars with known spectral type, and (ii) the
analysis of two-colour diagrams, where the slope of observed colours
distribution is compared to the normal distribution. An algorithm to reproduce
the zero age main sequence (ZAMS) reddened colours was developed in order to
derive the average visual extinction (Av) that provides the best fitting of the
observational data. The structure of the clouds was evaluated by means of
statistical fractal analysis, aiming to compare their geometric structure with
the spatial distribution of the cluster members. The cluster NGC 6530 is the
only object of our sample showing anomalous extinction. In average, the other
clusters are suffering normal extinction, but several of their members, mainly
in NGC 2264, seem to have high Rv, probably due to circumstellar effects. The
ZAMS fitting provides Av values that are in good agreement with those found in
the literature. The fractal analysis shows that NGC 6530 has a centrally
concentrated distribution of stars that is different of the sub-structures
found in the density distribution of the cloud projected in the Av map,
suggesting that the original cloud has been changed with the cluster formation.
On the other hand, the fractal dimension and the statistical parameters of
Berkeley 86, NGC 2244, and NGC 2264 indicate a good cloud-cluster correlation,
when compared to other works based on artificial distribution of points.

Optical Coherence Tomography (FF-OCT) is used to image human breast tissue and
is evaluated to assess its ability to aid the pathologist's management of

routinely prepared histopathological material. The compact device used for this
study provides a 2 {\mu}m-lateral and a 1 {\mu}m-axial resolution, and is able
to scan a 1.5cm^2 specimen in about 7 minutes. 75 breast specimens obtained
from 22 patients have been imaged. Because the contrast in the images is
generated by endogenous tissue components, no biological, contrast agents or
specimen preparation is required. We characterized the major architectural
features and tissue structures of benign breast tissue, including adipocytes,
fibrous stroma, lobules and ducts. We subsequently characterized features
resulting from their pathological modification and developed a decision tree
for diagnosis. Two breast pathologists applied these criteria, resulting in a
demonstrable ability to distinguish between normal or benign tissue, in situ
and invasive carcinomas using FF-OCT images, with a sensitivity of 97% and 90%,
respectively, and specificity of 74% and 77% respectfully. FF-OCT shows great
potential for the evaluation of human tissue and its characterization as
normal/benign vs. lesional, for numerous ex-vivo clinical use-cases. Its high
imaging accuracy for in-situ and invasive carcinoma paves the way for
applications where a fast architectural assessment could improve the core
needle biopsy workflow, tumor margin assessments, and provides quality
assurance for tissue acquired for clinical care and research.

requires simulation, or approximation, of L\'{e}vy areas. In this paper,
through the construction of a suitable antithetic multilevel correction
estimator, we are able to avoid the simulation of L\'{e}vy areas and still
achieve an $O(\Delta t^2)$ multilevel correction variance for smooth payoffs,

gauge boson to bound the mentioned coupling. The most restrictive bounds come
from the calculation of the three-body decay. For this case, it was found that
the most restrictive result is provided by a vector-like coupling, denoted as
$|\Omega_{\mu\tau}|^2$, for the $Z_\chi$ case, finding around $10^{-2}$ for a

branching ratio for the $Z^\prime\to\tau\mu$ decay. According to the analyzed

instantaneous field view in hundreds or thousands of spectral channels with
higher spectral resolution than multispectral cameras. Imaging spectrometers
are therefore often referred to as hyperspectral cameras (HSCs). Higher
spectral resolution enables material identification via spectroscopic analysis,
which facilitates countless applications that require identifying materials in
scenarios unsuitable for classical spectroscopic analysis. Due to low spatial
resolution of HSCs, microscopic material mixing, and multiple scattering,
spectra measured by HSCs are mixtures of spectra of materials in a scene. Thus,
accurate estimation requires unmixing. Pixels are assumed to be mixtures of a
few materials, called endmembers. Unmixing involves estimating all or some of:
the number of endmembers, their spectral signatures, and their abundances at
each pixel. Unmixing is a challenging, ill-posed inverse problem because of
model inaccuracies, observation noise, environmental conditions, endmember
variability, and data set size. Researchers have devised and investigated many

In particular, we show that, during the radiation era, the root-mean-square

non-interacting cosmic string networks scales as $L \propto a^{3/2}$ ($a$ is

backreaction is taken into account. We demonstrate, however, that a small
non-vanishing constant loop chopping efficiency parameter $\tilde c$ leads to a
linear scaling solution with constant $L H \ll 1$ ($H$ is the Hubble parameter)

cosmologically relevant cosmic string role even in the case of light strings.

the compression and estimation of correlated signals transmitted over directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs). An LTN is a DAG network with multiple source and
receiver nodes. Source nodes transmit subspace projections of random correlated
signals by applying reduced-dimension linear transforms. The subspace
projections are linearly processed by multiple relays and routed to intended
receivers. Each receiver applies a linear estimator to approximate a subset of
the sources with minimum mean squared error (MSE) distortion. The model is
extended to include noisy networks with power constraints on transmitters. A
key task is to compute all local compression matrices and linear estimators in
the network to minimize end-to-end distortion. The non-convex problem is solved
iteratively within an optimization framework using constrained quadratic
programs (QPs). The proposed algorithm recovers as special cases the regular

distortion region of multi-source, multi-receiver networks are given for linear
coding based on convex relaxations. Cut-set lower bounds are also given for any

effective Newton constant is determined by the scale of noncommutativity and

according to list of choices, in a large number of national elections in
different countries. Considering 11 countries without compulsory voting
(Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Poland,
Romania, Spain and Switzerland), a stylized fact emerges for the most populated
cities when one computes the entropy associated to the three ratios, which we
call the entropy of civic involvement of the electorate. The distribution of
this entropy (over all elections and countries) appears to be sharply peaked
near a common value. This almost common value is typically shared since the
1970's by electorates of the most populated municipalities, and this despite
the wide disparities between voting systems and types of elections. Performing
different statistical analyses, we notably show that this stylized fact reveals
particular correlations between the blank/null votes and abstentionists ratios.
  We suggest that the existence of this hidden regularity, which we propose to
coin as a `weak law on recent electoral behavior among urban voters', reveals
an emerging collective behavioral norm characteristic of urban citizen voting
behavior in modern democracies. Analyzing exceptions to the rule provide
insights into the conditions under which this normative behavior can be
expected to occur.

diffusion axes in a local, field-aligned frame. We reexamine the transformation
for the diffusion tensor from this local to a global frame, in which the Parker
transport equation for energetic particles is usually formulated and solved.
Particularly, we generalize the transformation formulas to allow for an
explicit choice of two principal local perpendicular diffusion axes. This
generalization includes the 'traditional' diffusion tensor in the special case
of isotropic perpendicular diffusion. For the local frame, we motivate the
choice of the Frenet-Serret trihedron which is related to the intrinsic
magnetic field geometry. We directly compare the old and the new tensor
elements for two heliospheric magnetic field configurations, namely the hybrid
Fisk and the Parker field. Subsequently, we examine the significance of the
different formulations for the diffusion tensor in a standard 3D model for the
modulation of galactic protons. For this we utilize a numerical code to
evaluate a system of stochastic differential equations equivalent to the Parker
transport equation and present the resulting modulated spectra. The computed
differential fluxes based on the new tensor formulation deviate from those
obtained with the 'traditional' one (only valid for isotropic perpendicular
diffusion) by up to 60% for energies below a few hundred MeV depending on

quarters of Kepler data and reported by Batalha et al. (2013). These data show
899 transiting planet candidates in 365 multiple-planet systems and provide a
powerful means to study the statistical properties of planetary systems. Using
a generic mass-radius relationship, we find that only two pairs of planets in
these candidate systems (out of 761 pairs total) appear to be on Hill-unstable

interpreted as true systems. We find that planet pairs show little statistical
preference to be near mean-motion resonances. We identify an asymmetry in the
distribution of period ratios near first-order resonances (e.g., 2:1, 3:2),
with an excess of planet pairs lying wide of resonance and relatively few lying
narrow of resonance. Finally, based upon the transit duration ratios of
adjacent planets in each system, we find that the interior planet tends to have
a smaller transit impact parameter than the exterior planet does. This finding
suggests that the mode of the mutual inclinations of planetary orbital planes
is in the range 1.0-2.2 degrees, for the packed systems of small planets probed

of nonequivalent Fock representations of the canonical commutation relations
and, therefore, of inequivalent quantum theories. A context in which this kind
of ambiguities arises and prevents the derivation of robust results is, e.g.,
in the quantum analysis of cosmological perturbations. In these situations,
typically, a suitable scaling of the field by a time dependent function leads
to a description in an auxiliary static background, though the nonstationarity
still shows up in a time dependent mass. For such a field description, and
assuming the compactness of the spatial sections, we recently proved in three
or less spatial dimensions that the criteria of a natural implementation of the
spatial symmetries and of a unitary time evolution are able to select a unique
class of unitarily equivalent vacua, and hence of Fock representations. In this
work, we succeed to extend our uniqueness result to the consideration of all
possible field descriptions that can be reached by a time dependent canonical
transformation which, in particular, involves a scaling of the field by a
function of time. This kind of canonical transformations modify the dynamics of
the system and introduce a further ambiguity in its quantum description,
exceeding the choice of a Fock representation. Remarkably, for any compact
spatial manifold in less than four dimensions, we show that our criteria
eliminate any possible nontrivial scaling of the field other than that leading
to the description in an auxiliary static background. Besides, we show that
either no time dependent redefinition of the field momentum is allowed or, if
this may happen, the redefinition does not introduce any Fock representation
that cannot be obtained by a unitary transformation.

photometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability, its
field lacks optical photometry complete to the confusion limit of the Kepler
instrument necessary for selecting various classes of targets. For this reason,
we follow the observing strategy and data reduction method used in the IPHAS

reaching down to a 10-sigma limit of around 20th mag in the Vega system.
Observations covering around 50 deg2, thus about half of the field, passed our
quality control thresholds and constitute this first data release. We derive a
global photometric calibration by placing the KIS magnitudes as close as
possible to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) photometry. The initial data release

excitons (FXn=1 A -mLO, m= 1,2,3) respectively. Peak intensity of D1XA and
FXn=1 A -1LO transition increases non-linearly with increase of excitation
intensity due to exciton-exciton scattering. Peak position of D1XA shows red
shift while FXn=1 A -1LO shows blue shift with increase of excitation
intensity. Fraction of exciton taking part in emission process and radiative
lifetime of exciton decreases with decrease of temperature .Threshold value of
excitation for D1XA decreases exponentially with decrease of temperature upto
100K. Whereas, below 100K no functional behaviour is observed. Threshold for

present models in 5D warped spacetime, in which supersymmetry breaking and

and the top multiplets are localized to the infrared brane. The hierarchy of
the Yukawa matrices can be obtained while keeping near flavor degeneracy
between the first two generation sfermions, avoiding stringent constraints from
flavor and CP violation. Through the AdS/CFT correspondence, the models can be
interpreted as purely 4D theories in which the top and Higgs multiplets are
composites of some strongly interacting sector exhibiting nontrivial dynamics
at a low energy. Because of the compositeness of the Higgs and top multiplets,
Landau pole constraints for the Higgs and top couplings apply only up to the
dynamical scale, allowing for a relatively heavy Higgs boson, including m_h =
125 GeV as suggested by the recent LHC data. We analyze electroweak symmetry
breaking for a well-motivated subset of these models, and find that fine-tuning
in electroweak symmetry breaking is indeed ameliorated. We also discuss a flat

conditions, with the top multiplets localized to a brane while other matter
multiplets delocalized in the bulk.

have been increasing in many countries at alarming levels. A difficulty in the
conception of policies to reverse these trends is the identification of the
drivers behind the global epidemics. Here, we implement a spatial spreading
analysis to investigate whether diabetes, obesity and cancer show spatial
correlations revealing the effect of collective and global factors acting above
individual choices. We adapt a theoretical framework for critical physical
systems displaying collective behavior to decipher the laws of spatial
spreading of diseases. We find a regularity in the spatial fluctuations of
their prevalence revealed by a pattern of scale-free long-range correlations.
The fluctuations are anomalous, deviating in a fundamental way from the weaker
correlations found in the underlying population distribution. This collective
behavior indicates that the spreading dynamics of obesity, diabetes and some
forms of cancer like lung cancer are analogous to a critical point of
fluctuations, just as a physical system in a second-order phase transition.
According to this notion, individual interactions and habits may have
negligible influence in shaping the global patterns of spreading. Thus, obesity
turns out to be a global problem where local details are of little importance.
Interestingly, we find the same critical fluctuations in obesity and diabetes,
and in the activities of economic sectors associated with food production such
as supermarkets, food and beverage stores--- which cluster in a different
universality class than other generic sectors of the economy. These results
motivate future interventions to investigate the causality of this relation
providing guidance for the implementation of preventive health policies.

that achieves this target in large, random networks obtained by ""erasing"" a

We show that this problem is equivalent to the so-called Anderson model of
electron motion in dirty metals which has been used extensively in the analysis
of diffusion in random environments. A standard approximation to this model is
the so-called coherent potential approximation (CPA) method which we apply to
evaluate the first and second order intra-sample statistics of the optimal
power vector in one- and two-dimensional systems. This approach is equivalent
to traditional techniques from random matrix theory and free probability, but
while generally accurate (and in agreement with numerical simulations), it
fails to fully describe the system: in particular, results obtained in this way
fail to predict when power control becomes infeasible. In this regard, we find
that the infinite system is always unstable beyond a certain value of the
target SINR, but any finite system only has a small probability of becoming
unstable. This instability probability is proportional to the tails of the
eigenvalue distribution of the system which are calculated to exponential
accuracy using methodologies developed within the Anderson model and its ties
with random walks in random media. Finally, using these techniques, we also
calculate the tails of the system's power distribution under power control and
the rate of convergence of the Foschini-Miljanic power control algorithm in the

developments among the lattice kinetic schemes for computational fluid
dynamics. A key element in this approach is the use of central moments to
specify collision process and forcing, and thereby naturally maintaining
Galilean invariance, an important characteristic of fluid flows. When the
different central moments are relaxed at different rates like in a standard
multiple relaxation time (MRT) formulation based on raw moments, it is endowed
with a number of desirable physical and numerical features. Since the collision
operator exhibits a cascaded structure, this approach is also known as the
cascaded LBM. While the cascaded LBM has been developed sometime ago, a
systematic study of its numerical properties, such as accuracy, grid
convergence and stability for well defined canonical problems is lacking and
the present work is intended to fulfill this need. We perform a quantitative
study of the performance of the cascaded LBM for a set of benchmark problems of
differing complexity, viz., Poiseuille flow, decaying Taylor-Green vortex flow
and lid-driven cavity flow. We first establish its grid convergence and
demonstrate second order accuracy under diffusive scaling for both the velocity
field and its derivatives, i.e. components of the strain rate tensor, as well.
The method is shown to quantitatively reproduce steady/unsteady analytical
solutions or other numerical results with excellent accuracy. Numerical
experiments further demonstrate that the central moment MRT LBM results in
significant stability improvements when compared with certain existing
collision models at moderate additional computational cost.

negligible. If perturbation theory is used to find such solutions, the
expansion generally breaks down as the Vainshtein radius is approached from the

complementary, or classically dual, description of the same theory -- one in
which non-perturbative regions become accessible perturbatively. We consider a
few examples of classical solutions with various symmetries, and find that in
all the cases the dual formulation makes it rather simple to study regimes in
which the original perturbation theory fails to work. As an illustration, we
reproduce by perturbative calculations some of the already known
non-perturbative results, for a point-like source, cosmic string, and domain

constancy of the fundamental constants of physics. We have investigated
potential changes in the fine-structure constant, alpha, and the
proton-to-electron mass ratio, mu.
  The many-multiplet method allows one to use optical fine-structure
transitions to constrain (Delta alpha)/alpha at better than the 10^(-5) level.
We present a new analysis of 154 quasar absorbers with 0.2 < z <3.7 in VLT/UVES
spectra. From these absorbers we find 2.2 sigma evidence for angular variations
in alpha under a dipole+monopole model. Combined with previous Keck/HIRES
observations, we find 4.1 sigma evidence for angular (and therefore spatial)
variations in alpha, with maximal increase of alpha occurring in the direction
RA=(17.3 +/- 1.0) hr, dec=(-61 +/- 10) deg. Under a model where the observed
effect is proportional to the lookback-time distance the significance increases
to 4.2 sigma. Dipole models fitted to the VLT and Keck samples and models
fitted to z<1.6 and z>1.6 sub-samples independently yield consistent estimates
of the dipole direction, which suggests that the effect is not caused by
telescope systematics. We consider a number of systematic effects and show that
they are unable to explain the observed dipole effect.
  We have used spectra of the quasars Q0405-443, Q0347-383 and Q0528-250 from
VLT/UVES to investigate the absorbers at z=2.595, 3.025 and 2.811 in these
spectra respectively. We find that (Delta mu)/mu=(10.1 +/- 6.6) x 10^(-6), (8.2
+/- 7.5) x 10^(-6) and (-1.4 +/- 3.9) x 10^(-6) in these absorbers
respectively. A second spectrum of Q0528-250 provides an additional constraint
of (Delta mu)/mu=(0.2 +/- 3.2_stat +/- 1.9_sys) x 10^(-6). The weighted mean of
these values yields (Delta mu)/mu=(1.7 +/- 2.4) x 10^(-6), the most precise
constraint on evolution in mu at z>1.

siderophile element (HSE) abundance patterns inferred for the terrestrial
planets and the Moon suggest that a total of about 0.01 M_Earth of chondritic
material was delivered as `late veneer' by planetesimals to the terrestrial
planets after the end of giant impacts. Here we combine these two independent
lines of evidence for a leftover population of planetesimals and show that: 1)
A residual planetesimal population containing 0.01 M_Earth is able to damp the
eccentricities of the terrestrial planets after giant impacts to their observed
values. 2) At the same time, this planetesimal population can account for the
observed relative amounts of late veneer added to the Earth, Moon and Mars
provided that the majority of the late veneer was delivered by small
planetesimals with radii <10m. These small planetesimal sizes are required to
ensure efficient damping of the planetesimal's velocity dispersion by mutual
collisions, which in turn ensures that the planets' accretion cross sections
are significantly enhanced by gravitational focusing above their geometric
values. Specifically we find, in the limit that the relative velocity between
the terrestrial planets and the planetesimals is significantly less than the
terrestrial planets' escape velocities, that gravitational focusing yields an
accretion ratio Earth/Mars~17, which agrees well with the accretion ratio
inferred from HSEs of 12-23. For the Earth-Moon system, we find an accretion
ratio of ~200, which is consistent with estimates of 150-700 derived from HSE
abundances that include the lunar crust as well as mantle component. (Abridged)

and photometric measurements simultaneous with a long se gmented exposure using
the CHANDRA satellite. Contemporaneous optical photometry from WASP-S indicates
a 4.74 day period was present during this time. Absence of a similar
periodicity in the H-alpha flux and the total X-ray flux points to a different
source of photometric variations. The H-alpha emission line appears
intrinsically broad and symmetric, and both the profile and its variability
suggest an origin in the post-shock cooling region. An accretion event,
signaled by soft X-rays, is traced spectroscopically for the first time through
the optical emission line profiles. After the accretion event, downflowing
turbulent material observed in the H-alpha and H-beta lines is followed by He I
(5876A) broadening. Optical veiling increases with a delay of about 2 hours
after the X-ray accretion event. The response of the stellar coronal emission
to an increase in the veiling follows about 2.4 hours later, giving direct
evidence that the stellar corona is heated in part by accretion. Subsequently,
the stellar wind becomes re-established. We suggest a model that incorporates
this sequential series of events: an accretion shock, a cooling downflow in a
supersonically turbulent region, followed by photospheric and later, coronal
heating. This model naturally explains the presence of broad optical and
ultraviolet lines, and affects the mass accretion rates determined from
emission line profiles.

stellar and gas disc, enveloped in a static dark matter halo. Similar to what
is found in our pure N-body simulation of a non-barred galaxy in Grand et. al.

speeds decrease with radius, in such a way that the pattern speed is similar to
the rotation of star particles. Compared to the non-barred case, we find that
the spiral arm pattern speed is slightly faster than the rotation speed of star
particles: the bar appears to boost the pattern speed ahead of the rotational

and demonstrate that there are star particles that are drawn towards and join
the arm from behind (in front of) the arm and migrate toward the outer (inner)
regions of the disc until the arm disappears as a result of their transient
nature. We see this migration over the entire radial range analysed, which is a
consequence of the spiral arm rotating at similar speeds to star particles at
all radii, which is inconsistent with the prediction of classical density wave
theory. The bar does not prevent this systematic radial migration, which is
shown to largely preserve circular orbits. We also demonstrate that there is no
significant offset of different star forming tracers across the spiral arm,

defining features of chaos is the tendency of a system to lose memory of its
initial conditions (more precisely, of the distribution of its initial
conditions). For a dynamical system preserving a probability measure, this
property is named `mixing' and is equivalent to the decay of correlations for
observables in phase space. For the class of dynamical systems preserving
infinite measures, this probabilistic connection is lost and no completely
satisfactory definition has yet been found which expresses the idea of losing
track of the initial state of a system due to its chaotic dynamics. This is
actually on open problem in the field of infinite ergodic theory. Virtually all
the definitions that have been attempted so far use ""local observables"", that
is, functions that essentially only ""see"" finite portions of the phase space.
In this note we introduce the concept of ""global observable"", a function that
gauges a certain quantity throughout the phase space. This concept is based on
the notion of infinite-volume average, which plays the role of the expected
value of a global observable. Endowed with these notions, whose rigorous
definition is to be specified on a case-by-case basis, we give a number of
definitions of infinite mixing. These fall in two categories: global-global
mixing, which expresses the ""decorrelation"" of two global observables, and
global-local mixing, where a global and a local observable are considered
instead. These definitions are tested on two types of
infinite-measure-preserving dynamical systems, the random walks and the Farey
map.

sometimes called the BICM capacity, is investigated at low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), i.e., in the wideband regime. A new linear transform that depends
on bits' probabilities is introduced. This transform is used to prove the
asymptotical equivalence between certain BICM systems with uniform and
nonuniform input distributions. Using known results for BICM systems with a
uniform input distribution, we completely characterize the combinations of
input alphabet, input distribution, and binary labeling that achieve the
Shannon limit -1.59 dB. The main conclusion is that a BICM system achieves the
Shannon limit at low SNR if and only if it can be represented as a zero-mean
linear projection of a hypercube, which is the same condition as for uniform
input distributions. Hence, probabilistic shaping offers no extra degrees of
freedom to optimize the low-SNR mutual information of BICM systems, in addition
to what is provided by geometrical shaping. These analytical conclusions are
confirmed by numerical results, which also show that for a fixed input
alphabet, probabilistic shaping of BICM can improve the mutual information in
the low and medium SNR range over any coded modulation system with a uniform
input distribution.

between Cartan bimodule algebras A_1 and A_2 extends uniquely to a normal
*-isomorphism of the von Neumann algebras generated by A_1 and A_2 [13,
Corollary 4.3]. Mercer's argument relied upon the Spectral Theorem for
Bimodules of Muhly, Saito and Solel [15, Theorem 2.5]. Unfortunately, the
arguments in the literature supporting [15, Theorem 2.5] contain gaps, and
hence Mercer's proof is incomplete.
  In this paper, we use the outline in [16, Remark 2.17] to give a proof of
Mercer's Theorem under the additional hypothesis that the given Cartan bimodule
isomorphism is weak-* continuous. Unlike the arguments contained in [13, 15],
we avoid the use of the Feldman-Moore machinery from [8]; as a consequence, our
proof does not require the von Neumann algebras generated by the algebras A_i
to have separable preduals. This point of view also yields some insights on the
von Neumann subalgebras of a Cartan pair (M,D), for instance, a strengthening
of a result of Aoi [1].
  We also examine the relationship between various topologies on a von Neumann
algebra M with a Cartan MASA D. This provides the necessary tools to
parametrize the family of Bures-closed bimodules over a Cartan MASA in terms of
projections in a certain abelian von Neumann algebra; this result may be viewed
as a weaker form of the Spectral Theorem for Bimodules, and is a key ingredient
in the proof of our version of Mercer's theorem. Our results lead to a notion
of spectral synthesis for weak-* closed bimodules appropriate to our context,
and we show that any von Neumann subalgebra of M which contains D is synthetic.
  We observe that a result of Sinclair and Smith shows that any Cartan MASA in
a von Neumann algebra is norming in the sense of Pop, Sinclair and Smith.

systems to models of geometrically thin, optically thick disks, and find that
we are able to match the measured SEDs to within 3 sigma of the uncertainties,

better fit than those below the dust sublimation temperature. Possible
explanations for the dearth of dust around SDSS1043+0855 are briefly discussed.

the left kernel of E, L(C,D), is the unique closed two-sided ideal of C maximal
with respect to having trivial intersection with D. When L(C,D)=0, we show the
MASA D norms C. We apply these results to extend existing results in the
literature on isometric isomorphisms of norm-closed subalgebras which lie
between D and C.
  The map E can be used as a substitute for a conditional expectation in the
construction of coordinates for C relative to D. Coordinate constructions of
Kumjian and Renault may partially be extended to settings where no conditional
expectation exists.
  As an example, we consider the situation in which C is the reduced crossed
product of a unital abelian C*-algebra D by an arbitrary discrete group acting
as automorphisms of D. We characterize when the relative commutant, D', of D in
C is abelian in terms of the dynamics of the action of the group and show that
when D' is abelian, L(C,D')=0. This setting produces examples where no
conditional expectation of C onto D' exists.
  When C is separable, and D is a regular MASA in C, we show the set of pure
states on D with unique state extensions to C is dense in D. We introduce a new
class of well behaved state extensions, the compatible states; we identify
compatible states when D is a MASA in C in terms of groups constructed from
local dynamics near a pure state on D.
  A particularly nice class of regular inclusions is the class of C*-diagonals.
We show that the pair (C,D) regularly embeds into a C*-diagonal precisely when

The general ""Lifshitz"" configuration of parallel semi-infinite dielectric slabs

This was indirectly confirmed in the 1970s, and more directly by Capasso's
group recently. It has also been known for many years that electrically and
magnetically polarizable bodies can experience a repulsive quantum vacuum
force. More amenable to practical application are situations where repulsion
could be achieved between ordinary conducting and dielectric bodies in vacuum.
The status of the field of Casimir repulsion with emphasis on recent
developments will be surveyed. Here, stress will be placed on analytic
developments, especially of Casimir-Polder (CP) interactions between
anisotropically polarizable atoms, and CP interactions between anisotropic
atoms and bodies that also exhibit anisotropy, either because of anisotropic

based on following geodesic curves in a manifold of possible sensor
configurations. This perspective arises by observing that, given a parameter
estimation problem to be addressed through management of sensor assets, any
particular sensor configuration corresponds to a Riemannian metric on the
parameter manifold. With this perspective, managing sensors involves navigation
on the space of all Riemannian metrics on the parameter manifold, which is
itself a Riemannian manifold. Existing work assumes the metric on the parameter
manifold is one that, in statistical terms, corresponds to a Jeffreys prior on
the parameter to be estimated. It is observed that informative priors, as arise
in sensor management, can also be accommodated. Given an initial sensor
configuration, the trajectory along which to move in sensor configuration space
to gather most information is seen to be locally defined by the geodesic
structure of this manifold. Further, divergences based on Fisher and Shannon
information lead to the same Riemannian metric and geodesics.

contemporaneous supernova. The model light curve based on other GRB-SN events

There are three (possibly) different types of nondeterminism in quantum
computation: i) strong, ii) weak with classical proofs, and iii) weak with
quantum proofs. Here we focus on the first one. A strong quantum
nondeterministic protocol accepts a correct input with positive probability,
and rejects an incorrect input with probability 1. In this work we relate
strong quantum nondeterministic multiparty communication complexity to the rank
of the communication tensor in the Number-On-Forehead and Number-In-Hand
models. In particular, by extending the definition proposed by de Wolf to {\it
nondeterministic tensor-rank} ($nrank$), we show that for any boolean function
$f$ when there is no prior shared entanglement between the players, 1) in the
Number-On-Forehead model, the cost is upper-bounded by the logarithm of
$nrank(f)$; 2) in the Number-In-Hand model, the cost is lower-bounded by the
logarithm of $nrank(f)$. Furthermore, we show that when the number of players
is $o(\log\log n)$ we have that $NQP\nsubseteq BQP$ for Number-On-Forehead

Salt depletion leads to a large electric field which expels water co-ions,
causing the membrane to discharge and lose its selectivity. Since salt co-ions
and water ions contribute to OLC, CIMD interferes with electrodialysis (salt
counter-ion removal) but could be exploited for current-assisted ion exchange
and pH control. CIMD also suppresses the extended space charge that leads to
EOI, so it should be reconsidered in both models and experiments on OLC.

time-slotted wireless network. However, there exists an adversary, Carol, who
aims to prevent the transmission of $m$ by jamming the communication channel.
There is a per-slot cost of $1$ to send, receive or jam $m$ on the channel, and
we are interested in how much Alice and Bob need to spend relative to Carol in
order to guarantee communication.
  Our approach is to design an algorithm in the framework of
resource-competitive analysis where the cost to correct network devices (i.e.,
Alice and Bob) is parameterized by the cost to faulty devices (i.e., Carol). We
present an algorithm that guarantees the successful transmission of $m$ and has
the following property: if Carol incurs a cost of $T$ to jam, then both Alice
and Bob have a cost of $O(T^{\varphi - 1} + 1)=O(T^{.62}+1)$ in expectation,
where $\varphi = (1+ \sqrt{5})/2$ is the golden ratio. In other words, it
possible for Alice and Bob to communicate while incurring asymptotically less
cost than Carol. We generalize to the case where Alice wishes to send $m$ to
$n$ receivers, and we achieve a similar result.
  Our findings hold even if (1) $T$ is unknown to either party; (2) Carol knows
the algorithms of both parties, but not their random bits; (3) Carol can jam

interface formation has been, for the first time, fully incorporated into a
numerical code based on the finite element method and applied, as a test case,
to the problem of capillary rise. The motivation for this work comes from the
fact that, as discovered experimentally more than a decade ago, the key
variable in dynamic wetting flows -the dynamic contact angle - depends not just
on the velocity of the three-phase contact line but on the entire flow
field/geometry. Hence, to describe this effect, it becomes necessary to use the
mathematical model that has this dependence as its integral part. A new
physical effect, termed the `hydrodynamic resist to dynamic wetting', is
discovered where the influence of the capillary's radius on the dynamic contact
angle, and hence on the global flow, is computed. The capabilities of the
numerical framework are then demonstrated by comparing the results to
experiments on the unsteady capillary rise, where excellent agreement is
obtained. Practical recommendations on the spatial resolution required by the
numerical scheme for a given set of non-dimensional similarity parameters are
provided, and a comparison to asymptotic results available in limiting cases
confirms that the code is converging to the correct solution. The appendix

a further study of our previous work, both the isoscalar and isovector vector
interactions are included in the Polyakov loop modified Nambu--Jona-Lasinio
model (PNJL) for the quark phase. The relevance of the exchange (Fock) terms is
stressed and suitably accounted for. The calculation shows that the isovector
vector interaction delays the phase transition to higher densities and the
range of the mixed phase correspondingly shrinks. Meanwhile the asymmetry
parameter of quark matter in the mixed phase decreases with the strengthening
of this interaction channel. This leads to some possible observation signals
being weakened, although still present. We show that these can be rather
general effects of a repulsion in the quark phase due to the symmetry energy.
This is also confirmed by a simpler calculation with the MIT--Bag model.
However, the asymmetry parameter of quark matter is slightly enhanced with the
inclusion of the isoscalar vector interaction, but the phase transition will be
moved to higher densities. The largest uncertainty on the phase transition lies
in the undetermined coupling constants of the vector interactions. In this
respect new data on the mixed phase obtained from Heavy Ion Collisions at
Intermediate Energies appear very important.

both the Spitzer GLIMPSE and 1.1 mm BGPS survey catalogs. The observed sources
satisfy both the GLIMPSE mid-IR criteria of [3.6]-[4.5]>1.3, [3.6]-[5.8]>2.5,
[3.6]-[8.0]>2.5 and 8.0 um magnitude less than 10, and also have an associated
1.1 mm BGPS source. Class I methanol maser emission was detected in 63 sources,
corresponding to a detection rate of 29% for this survey. For the majority of
detections (43), this is the first identification of a class I methanol maser
associated with these sources. We show that the intensity of the class I
methanol maser emission is not closely related to mid-IR intensity or the
colors of the GLIMPSE point sources, however, it is closely correlated with
properties (mass and beam-averaged column density) of the BGPS sources.
Comparison of measures of star formation activity for the BGPS sources with and
without class I methanol masers indicate that the sources with class I methanol
masers usually have higher column density and larger flux density than those
without them. Our results predict that the criteria
log(S_{int})<-38.0+1.72log(N_{H_{2}}^{beam}) and log(N_{H_{2}}^{beam})>22.1,
which utilizes both the integrated flux density (S_{int}) and beam-averaged
column density (N_{H_{2}}^{beam}) of the BGPS sources, are very efficient for
selecting sources likely to have an associated class I methanol maser. Our
expectation is that searches using these criteria will detect 90% of the
predicted number of class I methanol masers from the full BGPS catalog (~
1000), and do so with a high detection efficiency (~75%).

spatial multivariate data: summarizing covariation structures and identifying
spatial patterns. In practice, achieving both goals simultaneously is a
statistical challenge, and a range of methods have been developed that offer
trade-offs between these two objectives. In an applied context, this
methodological question has been and remains a major issue in community
ecology, where species assemblages (i.e., covariation between species
abundances) are often driven by spatial processes (and thus exhibit spatial
patterns). In this paper we review a variety of methods developed in community

test the linear bias model with weak-lensing and galaxy clustering measurements

bias of galaxies between redshifts z=0.2 and z=1, and over correlation scales
between R=0.2 h^-1 Mpc and R=15 h^-1 Mpc. We focus on three galaxy samples,
selected in flux (simultaneous cuts I_814W < 26.5 and K_s < 24), and in
stellar-mass (10^9 < M_* < 10^10 h^-2 Msun and 10^10 < M^*< 10^11 h^-2 Msun).
At scales R > 2 h^-1 Mpc, our measurements support a model of bias increasing
with redshift. The Tinker et al. (2010) fitting function provides a good fit to
the data. We find the best fit mass of the galaxy halos to be log(M_200 h^-1
Msun) = 11.7^+0.6_-1.3 and log(M_200 h^-1 Msun) = 12.4^+0.2_-2.9 respectively
for the low and high stellar-mass samples. In the halo model framework, bias is
scale-dependent with a change of slope at the transition scale between the one
and the two halo terms. We detect a scale-dependence of bias with a turn-down
at scale R=2.3\pm1.5 h^-1 Mpc, in agreement with previous galaxy clustering
studies. We find no significant amount of stochasticity, suggesting that a

of zero temperatures and for selected parametrization of the nuclear models.
The solutions lead to a new structure of the star: a positively charged core at
supranuclear densities surrounded by an electronic distribution of thickness
$\sim \hbar/(m_e c)$ of opposite charge, as well as a neutral crust at lower
densities. Inside the core there is a Coulomb potential well of depth $\sim
m_\pi c^2/e$. The constancy of the Klein potentials in the transition from the
core to the crust, impose the presence of an overcritical electric field $\sim
(m_\pi/m_e)^2 E_c$, the critical field being $E_c=m^2_e c^3/(e \hbar)$. The

When spun in the preferred direction, it spins smoothly, whereas in the other
direction it starts to oscillate wildly. The oscillation soon dies out and the
rattleback starts to spin in the preferred way. We will construct and go
through an analytical model capable of explaining this behaviour in a simple

both the genetic markers and gene expression data on the same subjects. The
gene expression levels are often treated as quantitative traits and are subject
to standard genetic analysis in order to identify the gene expression
quantitative loci (eQTL). However, the genetic architecture for many gene
expressions may be complex, and poorly estimated genetic architecture may
compromise the inferences of the dependency structures of the genes at the
transcriptional level. In this paper we introduce a sparse conditional Gaussian
graphical model for studying the conditional independent relationships among a
set of gene expressions adjusting for possible genetic effects where the gene
expressions are modeled with seemingly unrelated regressions. We present an
efficient coordinate descent algorithm to obtain the penalized estimation of
both the regression coefficients and the sparse concentration matrix. The
corresponding graph can be used to determine the conditional independence among
a group of genes while adjusting for shared genetic effects. Simulation
experiments and asymptotic convergence rates and sparsistency are used to
justify our proposed methods. By sparsistency, we mean the property that all
parameters that are zero are actually estimated as zero with probability
tending to one. We apply our methods to the analysis of a yeast eQTL data set
and demonstrate that the conditional Gaussian graphical model leads to a more
interpretable gene network than a standard Gaussian graphical model based on
gene expression data alone.

with non local aggregative coupling on the circle, that exhibits a transition
from an uncoherent state to a coherent one when the coupling strength is
increased. We show first that all solutions of the equation converge to the set
of equilibria, second that the set of equilibria undergoes a bifurcation
representing the transition to coherence when the coupling strength is
increased. These two properties are similar to the situation with linear
diffusion. Nevertheless nonlinear diffusion alters the transition scenari,
which are different when the diffusion is sub-quadratic and when the diffusion
is super-quadratic. When the diffusion is super-quadratic, it results in a
multistability region that preceeds the pitchfork bifurcation at which the
uncoherent equilibrium looses stability. When the diffusion is quadratic the
pitchfork bifurcation at the onset of coherence is infinitely degenerate and a
disk of equilibria exist for the critical value of the coupling strength.
Another impact of nonlinear diffusion is that coherent equilibria become
localized when advection is strong enough, a phenomenon that is preculded when
the diffusion is linear.

Typical covering factors of individual features at the 1 K.km/s level were 20%.
2) CO-H2 conversion factors as much as 4-5 times below the mean value N(H2)/Wco

of the conversion factor on arcminute scales are due primarily to CO chemistry
and need not represent unresolved variations in reddening or total column
density. Hence, like FERMI and PLANCK we see some gas that is dark in CO and
other gas in which CO is overluminous per H2. A standard CO-H2 conversion

be a powerful design that increases the efficiency of estimation based on data
that is censored due to an instrument's lower limit of detection (LLOD).
However, there are situations when the pooling design strongly aggravates the
detection limit problem. To combine the benefits of pooled assays and
individual assays, hybrid designs that involve taking a sample of both pooled
and individual specimens have been proposed. We examine the efficiency of these
hybrid designs in estimating parameters of two systems subject to a LLOD: (1)
normally distributed biomarker with normally distributed measurement error and
pooling error; (2) Gamma distributed biomarker with double exponentially
distributed measurement error and pooling error. Three-assay design and

pooling error. The Maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the

charge, necessary for the luminosity performance of the collider. To limit the
beam emittance blow-up due to oscillations, the pulse power modulators for the
damping ring kickers must provide extremely flat, high-voltage pulses:
specifications call for a 160 ns duration and a flattop of 12.5 kV, 250 A, with
a combined ripple and droop of not more than \pm0.02 %. The stripline design is
also extremely challenging: the field for the damping ring kicker system must
be homogenous to within \pm0.01 % over a 1 mm radius, and low beam coupling
impedance is required. The solid-state modulator, the inductive adder, is a
very promising approach to meeting the demanding specifications for the field

the energy range 70 - 400 GeV from the flat spectrum radio quasar PKS 1222+216
represents a challenge for all interpretative scenarios. Indeed, in order to
avoid absorption of \gamma rays in the dense ultraviolet radiation field of the
broad line region (BLR), one is forced to invoke some unconventional
astrophysical picture, like for instance the existence of a very compact (r\sim
10^{14} cm) emitting blob at a large distance (R \sim10^{18} cm) from the jet
base. We offer the investigation of a scenario based on the standard blazar
model for PKS 1222+216 where \gamma rays are produced close to the central
engine, but we add the new assumption that inside the source photons can
oscillate into axion-like particles (ALPs), which are a generic prediction of
several extensions of the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions.
As a result, a considerable fraction of very-high-energy photons can escape
absorption from the BLR through the mechanism of photon-ALP oscillations much
in the same way as they largely avoid absorption from extragalactic background
light when propagating over cosmic distances in the presence of large-scale
magnetic fields in the nG range. In addition we show that the above MAGIC
observations and the simultaneous Fermi/LAT observations in the energy range
0.3 - 3 GeV can both be explained by a standard spectral energy distribution
for experimentally allowed values of the model parameters. In particular, we
need a very light ALP just like in the case of photon-ALP oscillations in
cosmic space. Moreover, we find it quite tantalizing that the most favorable
value of the photon-ALP coupling happens to be the same in both situations.
Although our ALPs cannot contribute to the cold dark matter, they are a viable
candidate for the quintessential dark energy. [abridged]

stars form in very large numbers. Most attractive places for catching low-mass
star formation in the act are young stellar clusters and associations, still
(half-)embedded in star-forming regions. The low-mass stars in such regions are
still in their pre--main-sequence (PMS) evolutionary phase. The peculiar nature
of these objects and the contamination of their samples by the evolved
populations of the Galactic disk impose demanding observational techniques for
the detection of complete numbers of PMS stars in the Milky Way. The Magellanic
Clouds, the companion galaxies to our own, demonstrate an exceptional star
formation activity. The low extinction and stellar field contamination in
star-forming regions of these galaxies imply a more efficient detection of
low-mass PMS stars than in the Milky Way, but their distance from us make the
application of special detection techniques unfeasible. Nonetheless, imaging
with the Hubble Space Telescope yield the discovery of solar and sub-solar PMS
stars in the Magellanic Clouds from photometry alone. Unprecedented numbers of
such objects are identified as the low-mass stellar content of their
star-forming regions, changing completely our picture of young stellar systems
outside the Milky Way, and extending the extragalactic stellar IMF below the
persisting threshold of a few solar masses. This review presents the recent
developments in the investigation of PMS stars in the Magellanic Clouds, with
special focus on the limitations by single-epoch photometry that can only be
circumvented by the detailed study of the observable behavior of these stars in
the color-magnitude diagram. The achieved characterization of the low-mass PMS
stars in the Magellanic Clouds allowed thus a more comprehensive understanding
of the star formation process in our neighboring galaxies.

user-selected parameters and for selecting a ""best"" model. For example, the
method of $k$-nearest neighbors requires the user to choose $k$, the number of
neighbors, and a neural network has several tuning parameters controlling the
network complexity. Once such parameters are optimized for a particular data
set, the next step is often to compare the various optimized models and choose
the method with the best predictive performance. Both tuning and model
selection boil down to comparing models, either across different values of the
tuning parameters or across different classes of statistical models and/or sets
of explanatory variables. For multiple large sets of data, like the PubChem
drug discovery cheminformatics data which motivated this work, reliable CV
comparisons are computationally demanding, or even infeasible. In this paper we
develop an efficient sequential methodology for model comparison based on CV.
It also takes into account the randomness in CV. The number of models is
reduced via an adaptive, multiplicity-adjusted sequential algorithm, where poor
performers are quickly eliminated. By exploiting matching of individual
observations, it is sometimes even possible to establish the statistically
significant inferiority of some models with just one execution of CV.

signal (CMB) from millimeter/submillimeter observations is the pollution by
emission from the Milky Way: synchrotron, free-free, and thermal dust emission.
To extract the fundamental cosmological parameters from CMB signal, it is
mandatory to minimize this pollution since it will create systematic errors in
the CMB power spectra. In previous investigations, it has been demonstrated
that the neural network method provide high quality CMB maps from temperature
data. Here the analysis is extended to polarization maps. As a concrete
example, the WMAP 7-year polarization data, the most reliable determination of
the polarization properties of the CMB, has been analysed. The analysis has
adopted the frequency maps, noise models, window functions and the foreground
models as provided by the WMAP Team, and no auxiliary data is included. Within
this framework it is demonstrated that the network can extract the CMB
polarization signal with no sign of pollution by the polarized foregrounds. The
errors in the derived polarization power spectra are improved compared to the

variable primarily due to the occurrence of blueward migrating discrete
absorption components (DACs). Empirical (SEI) line-synthesis modelling is used
to determine the range of fluctuations in radial optical depth, which are
assigned to the temporal changes in large-scale wind structures. We argue that
DACs are common in CSPN winds, and their empirical properties are akin to those

filamentous actin (F-actin) is studied using a coarse-grained model and
molecular dynamics simulation. Real diameter size, helically ordered charge
distribution and twist rigidity of F-actin are taken into account in our model.
The attraction between parallel F-actins induced by multivalent counterions is
studied in detail and it is found that the maximum attraction occurs between
their closest charged domains. The model F-actins aggregate due to the
like-charge attraction and form closely packed bundles. Counterions are mostly
distributed in the narrowest gaps between neighboring F-actins inside the
bundles and the channels between three adjacent F-actins correspond to low
density of the counterions. Density of the counterions varies periodically with
a wave length comparable to the separation between consecutive G-actin monomers
along the actin polymers. Long-lived defects in the hexagonal order of F-actins
in the bundles are observed that their number increases with increasing the
bundles size. Combination of electrostatic interactions and twist rigidity has
been found not to change the symmetry of F-actin helical conformation from the
native 13/6 symmetry. Calculation of zero-temperature energy of hexagonally
ordered model F-actins with the charge of the counterions distributed as
columns of charge domains representing counterion charge density waves has
shown that helical symmetries commensurate with the hexagonal lattice
correspond to local minima of the energy of the system. The global minimum of
energy corresponds to 24/11 symmetry with the columns of charge domains
arranged in the narrowest gaps between the neighboring F-actins.

of its four components can be explained by two separate eclipsing binaries. In

previous parallel, two-way merge algorithms based on binary search and
sequential merge in parallel. First, it is shown that the additional merge step
of distinguished elements as found in previous algorithms is not necessary,
thus simplifying the implementation and reducing constant factors. Second, by
fixating the requirements to the binary search, the merge algorithm becomes
stable, provided that the sequential merge subroutine is stable. The stable,
parallel merge algorithm can easily be used to implement a stable, parallel
merge sort.
  For ordered sequences with $n$ and $m$ elements, $m\leq n$, the simplified
merge algorithm runs in $O(n/p+\log n)$ operations using $p$ processing
elements. It can be implemented on an EREW PRAM, but since it requires only a
single synchronization step, it is also a candidate for implementation on other
parallel, shared-memory computers.

However, as far as these processes depend differently on the coating thickness,

production of neutron-rich trans-iron elements, that form the bulk of the
""heavy nuclides"" (i.e. nuclides more massive than the iron-group nuclei) in the
solar-system composition, considered as ""standard of reference"" dataset for
cosmic abundances. In particular, the s-process produces about half of all the
trans-iron isotopes by moving along the ""valley of stability"" through a series
of neutron capture reactions and beta decays. More than one s-process
""component"" (i.e. a nucleosynthesis event with a single set of physical
conditions like neutron exposure, initial abundances and neutron density) is
required in order to explain the observed solar distribution of s-nuclei
abundances. Current views on the subject suggest the existence of several
components that, in terms of stellar environments, correspond to distinct
categories of stars in different evolutionary phases. Aims: The purpose of the
chapter is to review the s-process nucleosynthesis occurring in massive stars
(so-called weak component of s-process), pointing particular attention on the
recent studies devoted to analyze how the uncertainties due to stellar
evolution modeling and, specifically, due to convective overshooting affect the
efficiency of this nucleosynthesis process.

scenarios are considered: (1) A_0 = 0 GeV and tan(beta)=10 and (2) A_0 = -500
GeV and tan(beta)=40. In each case, the universal scalar mass parameter m_0
varies in the range [40,3000] GeV, while the universal gaugino mass parameter
m_{1/2} varies in the range [100,1000] GeV. We delineate notable regions in
parameter space, including the region with a charged LSP (stau), the LEP2
reach, and the cosmologically preferred region with 100% neutralino dark
matter. The templates also show mass contours for a few key particles (gluino,
squark and Higgs boson). The mass spectrum is calculated with the
SoftSusy-3.2.4 package, while the neutralino relic density is obtained with
MicrOMEGAs version 2.4.

Psygnosis in 1991, in which the player has to guide a tribe of lemming
creatures to safety through a hazardous landscape, by assigning them specific
skills that modify their behavior in different ways. In this paper we study the
optimization problem of saving the highest number of lemmings in a given
landscape with a given number of available skills.
  We prove that the game is PSPACE-complete, even if there is only one lemming
to save, and only Builder and Basher skills are available. We thereby settle an
open problem posed by Cormode in 2004, and again by Forisek in 2010. However we
also prove that, if we restrict the game to levels in which the available
Builder skills are only polynomially many (and there is any number of other
skills), then the game is solvable in NP. Similarly, if the available Basher,
Miner, and Digger skills are polynomially many, the game is solvable in NP.
  Furthermore, we show that saving the maximum number of lemmings is APX-hard,
even when only one type of skill is available, whatever this skill is. This
contrasts with the membership in P of the decision problem restricted to levels
with no ""deadly areas"" (such as water or traps) and only Climber and Floater
skills, as previously established by Cormode.

solid surfaces is a challenge in lab-on-chip technologies, DNA analysis, and
heat exchangers. The best-known mechanism, a wettability gradient, does not
move droplets rapidly enough for most purposes and cannot move droplets smaller
than a critical size defined by the contact angle hysteresis. Here we report on
a mechanism using curvature gradients, which we show is particularly effective
at accelerating small droplets, and works for both hydrophilic and hydrophobic
surfaces. Experiments for water droplets on glass cones in the sub-millimeter
range show a maximum speed of 0.28 m/s, two orders of magnitude higher than
obtained by wettability gradient. From simple considerations of droplet surface
area change, we show that the force exerted on a droplet on a conical surface
scales as the curvature gradient. This force therefore diverges for small
droplets near the tip of a cone. We illustrate this using molecular dynamics
simulations, and describe nanometer-scale droplets moving spontaneously at over
100 m/s on nano-cones.

non-commutative Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m geometry. Using the Israel
criteria, equation of motion for the polytropic matter shell is derived. In
order to explore the physical aspects of this equation, the most general
equation of state, $p=k{\rho}^{({1+\frac{1}{n}})}$, has been used for finite
and infinite values of $n$. The effective potentials corresponding to the
equation of motion have been used to explain different states of the matter
shell collapse. The numerical solution of the equation of motion predicts
collapse as well as expansion depending on the choice of initial data. Further,
in order to include the non-commutative correction, we modify the matter
components and re-formulate the equation of motion as well as the corresponding
effective potentials by including non-commutative factor and charge parameter.
It is concluded that charge reduces the velocity of the expanding or collapsing
matter shell but does not bring the shell to static position. While the
non-commutative factor with generic matter favors the formation of black hole.

and octonions by using the relation between quaternion basis elements with
Pauli matrices and Octonions with Gell Mann \lambda matrices. Connection
between the unitary groups of GUTs and the normed division algebra has been
established to re-describe the SU(5)gauge group. We have thus described the
SU(5)gauge group and its subgroup SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times U(1) by using
quaternion and octonion basis elements. As such the connection between U(1)
gauge group and complex number, SU(2) gauge group and quaternions and SU(3) and
octonions is established. It is concluded that the division algebra approach to
the the theory of unification of fundamental interactions as the case of GUTs
leads to the consequences towards the new understanding of these theories which
incorporate the existence of magnetic monopole and dyon.

only partly account for the effect on the Universe dynamics of that part of the

  The generalized Einstein equations are used to derive the cosmological
Friedman's equations describing the dynamics of a homogeneous isotropic

cosmological model of the universe based on these equations. Application of the
