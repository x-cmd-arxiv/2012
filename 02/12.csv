here if the TAWI can also grow in a curved rarefaction wave. The expansion of
an initially unmagnetized circular plasma cloud, which consists of protons and
hot electrons, into a vacuum is modelled for this purpose with a
two-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. It is shown that the
momentum transfer from the electrons to the radially accelerating protons can
indeed trigger a TAWI. Radial current channels form and the aperiodic growth of
a magnetowave is observed, which has a magnetic field that is oriented
orthogonal to the simulation plane. The induced electric field implies that the
electron density gradient is no longer parallel to the electric field. Evidence
is presented here for that this electric field modification triggers a second
magnetic instability, which results in a rotational low-frequency magnetowave.
The relevance of the TAWI is discussed for the growth of small-scale magnetic
fields in astrophysical environments, which are needed to explain the
electromagnetic emissions by astrophysical jets. It is outlined how this

for a total of respectively 67 and 179 Radial Velocity measurements for Gl433

and our main conclusion about both planetary systems. One of the three planets,
Gl667Cc, has a mass of only M2.sin(i)~4.25 M_earth and orbits in the central
habitable zone of its host star. It receives just 10% less stellar energy from
Gl667C than the Earth receives from the Sun. However planet evolution in
habitable zone can be very different if the host star is a M dwarf or a
solar-like star, without necessarily questioning the presence of water. The two
other planets, Gl433b and Gl667Cb, both have M2.sin(i) of ~5.5 M_earth and
periods of ~7 days. The Radial Velocity measurements of both stars contain
longer time scale signals, which we fit as longer period Keplerians. For Gl433
that signal probably originates in a Magnetic Cycle, while a longer time span
will be needed to conclude for Gl667C. The metallicity of Gl433 is close to
solar, while Gl667C is metal poor with [Fe/H] ~ -0.6. This reinforces the
recent conclusion that the occurence of Super-Earth planets does not strongly
correlate with stellar metallicity.

typically obtained from a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) having a state space of 2^n
hidden states where n is the number of meioses or edges in the pedigree. There
have been several attempts to speed up this calculation by reducing the
state-space of the HMM. One of these methods has been automated in a
calculation that is more efficient than the naive HMM calculation; however,
that method treats a special case and the efficiency gain is available for only
those rare pedigrees containing long chains of single-child lineages. The other
existing state-space reduction method treats the general case, but the existing
algorithm has super-exponential running time.
  We present three formulations of the state-space reduction problem, two
dealing with groups and one with partitions. One of these problems, the maximum
isometry group problem was discussed in detail by Browning and Browning. We
show that for pedigrees, all three of these problems have identical solutions.
Furthermore, we are able to prove the uniqueness of the solution using the
algorithm that we introduce. This algorithm leverages the insight provided by
the equivalence between the partition and group formulations of the problem to
quickly find the optimal state-space reduction for general pedigrees.
  We propose a new likelihood calculation which is a two-stage process: find
the optimal state-space, then run the HMM forward-backward algorithm on the
optimal state-space. In comparison with the one-stage HMM calculation, this new
method more quickly calculates the exact pedigree likelihood.

molecular hydrogen formation, which is a key reaction in the InterStellar

on amorphous silicate surfaces experimentally and theoretically, we extrapolate
the results to the sticking coefficient of atoms and propose a formulae that
gives the sticking coefficients of H and D on both silicates and icy dust
grains. In our experiments, we used the King and Wells method for measuring the
sticking coefficients of H2 and D2 molecules on a silicate surface held at 10
K. It consists of measuring with a QMS (quadrupole mass spectrometer) the
signals of H2 and D2 molecules reflected by the surface during the exposure of
the sample to the molecular beam at a temperature ranging from 20 K to 340 K.
We tested the efficiency of a physical model, developed previously for sticking
on water-ice surfaces. We applied this model to our experimental results for
the sticking coefficients of H2 and D2 molecules on a silicate surface and
estimated the sticking coefficient of atoms by a single measurement of atomic
recombination and propose an extrapolation. Sticking of H, D, HD, H2, and D2 on
silicates grains behaves the same as on icy dust grains. The sticking decreases
with the gas temperature, and is dependent on the mass of the impactor. The
sticking coefficient for both surfaces and impactors can be modeled by an
analytical formulae S(T), which describes both the experiments and the thermal
distribution expected in an astrophysical context. The parameters S0 and T0 are
summarized in a table. Previous estimates for the sticking coefficient of H
atoms are close to the new estimation; however, we find that, when isotopic
effects are taken into account, the sticking coefficient variations can be as
much as a factor of 2 at T=100 K.

momentum formalism. To simplify the source terms of the transport equations, a
methodology of multiflavour neutrino leakage scheme is partly employed. Our
newly developed code is designed to evolve the Einstein field equation together
with the GR radiation hydrodynamic equations. We follow the dynamics starting
from the onset of gravitational core-collapse of a 15 $M_{\odot}$ star, through
bounce, up to about 100 ms postbounce in this study to study how the spacial
multi-dimensionality and GR would affect the dynamics in the early postbounce
phase. Our 3D results support the anticipation in previous 1D results that the
neutrino luminosity and average neutrino energy of any neutrino flavor in the
postbounce phase increase when switching from SR to GR hydrodynamics. This is
because the deeper gravitational well of GR produces more compact core
structures, and thus hotter neutrino spheres at smaller radii. By analyzing the
residency timescale to the neutrino-heating timescale in the gain region, we
show that the criterion to initiate neutrino-driven explosions can be most
easily satisfied in 3D models, irrespective of SR or GR hydrodynamics. Our
results suggest that the combination of GR and 3D hydrodynamics provides the
most favorable condition to drive a robust neutrino-driven explosion.

vice-versa. Focusing on the case of a mean input current density $\mu=6.8$ at
which repetitive firing occurs and ISR had been found to be pronounced, some of
the properties of the corresponding stable equilibrium point are found. A
linearized approximation around this point has oscillatory solutions from whose
maxima spikes tend to occur. A one dimensional diffusion is also constructed
for small noise based on the correlations between the pairs of HH variables and
the small magnitudes of the fluctuations in two of them.
  Properties of the basin of attraction of the limit cycle (spike) are
investigated heuristically and also the nature of distribution of spikes at
very small noise corresponding to trajectories which do not ever enter the
basin of attraction of the equilibrium point. Long term trials of duration
500000 ms are carried out for values of the noise parameter $\sigma$ from 0 to
2.0, with results appearing in Section 3. The graph of mean spike count versus
$\sigma$ is divided into 4 regions $R_1,...,R_4,$ where $R_3$ contains the
minimum associated with ISR.

and adapts to foreign challenges through complex intracellular and
intercellular signaling networks. Endotoxin tolerance and priming elicited by
macrophages are classic examples of the complex adaptation of innate immune
cells. Upon repetitive exposures to different doses of bacterial endotoxin
(lipopolysaccharide) or other stimulants, macrophages show either suppressed or
augmented inflammatory responses compared to a single exposure to the
stimulant. Endotoxin tolerance and priming are critically involved in both
immune homeostasis and the pathogenesis of diverse inflammatory diseases.
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. By means
of a computational search through the parameter space of a coarse-grained
three-node network with a two-stage Metropolis sampling approach, we enumerated
all the network topologies that can generate priming or tolerance. We
discovered three major mechanisms for priming (pathway synergy, suppressor
deactivation, activator induction) and one for tolerance (inhibitor
persistence). These results not only explain existing experimental
observations, but also reveal intriguing test scenarios for future experimental
studies to clarify mechanisms of endotoxin priming and tolerance.

dependences of the spin lifetime in the case of short inter-pulse spacing
coincide with those of the momentum scattering time in the low temperature
regime, where nonmonotonic behaviors can appear. The origin of this feature is
that the scattering under the quick rephasing manipulation mainly performs as
the source of the dephasing channel instead of the key to suppress the
inhomogeneous broadening.

subjects were periodically swapped while maintaining the global coloring state
of the network. In the second variant, participants completed a series of

point. We report on the game dynamics and average completion times for the

infrastructures allows applications deployed in a cloud environment to
automatically increase and decrease the amount of used resources. This
capability is called auto-scaling and its main purpose is to automatically
adjust the scale of the system that is running the application to satisfy the
varying workload with minimum resource utilization. The need for auto-scaling
is particularly important during workload peaks, in which applications may need
to scale up to extremely large-scale systems.
  Both the research community and the main cloud providers have already
developed auto-scaling solutions. However, most research solutions are
centralized and not suitable for managing large-scale systems, moreover cloud
providers' solutions are bound to the limitations of a specific provider in
terms of resource prices, availability, reliability, and connectivity.
  In this paper we propose DEPAS, a decentralized probabilistic auto-scaling
algorithm integrated into a P2P architecture that is cloud provider
independent, thus allowing the auto-scaling of services over multiple cloud
infrastructures at the same time. Our simulations, which are based on real
service traces, show that our approach is capable of: (i) keeping the overall
utilization of all the instantiated cloud resources in a target range, (ii)
maintaining service response times close to the ones obtained using optimal

Software industry has an option to choose suitable methodology/process model
for its current needs to provide solutions to give problems. Though some
companies have their own customized methodology for developing their software
but majority agrees that software methodologies fall under two categories that
are heavyweight and lightweight. Heavyweight methodologies (Waterfall Model,
Spiral Model) are also known as the traditional methodologies, and their
focuses are detailed documentation, inclusive planning, and extroverted design.
Lightweight methodologies (XP, SCRUM) are, referred as agile methodologies.
Light weight methodologies focused mainly on short iterative cycles, and rely
on the knowledge within a team. The aim of this paper is to describe the
characteristics of popular heavyweight and lightweight methodologies that are
widely practiced in software industries. We have discussed the strengths and
weakness of the selected models. Further we have discussed the strengths and
weakness between the two opponent methodologies and some criteria is also
illustrated that help project managers for the selection of suitable model for
their projects.

virtues as far as software design is concerned is faced by lack of

In this paper, we report on progress on ongoing research by our group toward
putting together a platform as a testbed used for NGN application development.
We examine a novel component based development model used for SIP based mobile
applications. The developed model is to be used as framework for general

methods inspired by biological mechanisms of evolution. The methods catalogued
in this area use the Darwinian principles of life evolution to produce
algorithms that returns high quality solutions to hard-to-solve optimization
problems. The main strength of EC is precisely that they provide good solutions
even if the computational resources (e.g., running time) are limited. Astronomy
and Astrophysics are two fields that often require optimizing problems of high
complexity or analyzing a huge amount of data and the so-called complete
optimization methods are inherently limited by the size of the problem/data.
For instance, reliable analysis of large amounts of data is central to modern
astrophysics and astronomical sciences in general. EC techniques perform well
where other optimization methods are inherently limited (as complete methods
applied to NP-hard problems), and in the last ten years, numerous proposals
have come up that apply with greater or lesser success methodologies of
evolutional computation to common engineering problems. Some of these problems,
such as the estimation of non-lineal parameters, the development of automatic
learning techniques, the implementation of control systems, or the resolution
of multi-objective optimization problems, have had (and have) a special
repercussion in the fields. For these reasons EC emerges as a feasible
alternative for traditional methods. In this paper, we discuss some promising
applications in this direction and a number of recent works in this area; the
paper also includes a general description of EC to provide a global perspective
to the reader and gives some guidelines of application of EC techniques for
future research

formulas (QBF). The first type is a message passing based heuristics that can
prove unsatisfiability of the QBF by assigning the universal variables in such
a way that the remaining formula is unsatisfiable. In the second type, we use
message passing to guide branching heuristics of a Davis-Putnam
Logemann-Loveland (DPLL) complete solver. Numerical experiments show that on
random QBFs our branching heuristics gives robust exponential efficiency gain
with respect to the state-of-art solvers. We also manage to solve some
previously unsolved benchmarks from the QBFLIB library. Apart from this our
study sheds light on using message passing in small systems and as subroutines
in complete solvers.

in their lowest energy state, forming a time analogue of crystalline spatial
order. Challenges facing that idea are identified and overcome. We display
arbitrary orbits of an angular variable as lowest-energy trajectories for
nonsingular Lagrangian systems. Dynamics within orbits of broken symmetry
provide a natural arena for formation of time crystals. We exhibit models of
that kind, including a model with traveling density waves.

in a Kerr medium. The collapse is suppressed compared to a non- vortex Airy
beam in a Kerr medium as a result of the existence of vortex fields. The
locations of collapse depend sensitively on the initial power, vortex order,
and modulation parameters. Unlike the collapses reported before for any beam,
the collapse may occur in a position where the initial field is nearly zero
while no collapse appears in the region where the initial field is mainly
distributed. This study sheds light on how to control and manipulate the
location of collapse based on the initial power, vortex order and modulation
parameter.

which have been studied in recent years, including the landing of flocks of
birds. We investigate the collective decision making scenario where a flock of
birds decides the optimal time of landing in the absence of a global leader. We
introduce a simple phenomenological model in the spirit of the statistical
mechanics-based self-propelled particles (SPP-s) approach to interpret this
process. We expect that our model is applicable to a larger class of
spatiotemporal decision making situations than just the landing of flocks
(which process is used as a paradigmatic case). In the model birds are only
influenced by observable variables, like position and velocity. Heterogeneity
is introduced in the flock in terms of a depletion time after which a bird
feels increasing bias to move towards the ground. Our model demonstrates a
possible mechanism by which animals in a large group can arrive at an
egalitarian decision about the time of switching from one activity to another
in the absence of a leader. In particular, we show the existence of a
paradoxical effect where noise enhances the coherence of the landing process.

  fields",,,,,"math.NT math.CA math.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider generalised root identities for zeta functions of curves over
finite fields, \zeta_{k}, and compare with the corresponding analysis for the
Riemann zeta function. We verify numerically that, as for \zeta, the \zeta_{k}
do satisfy the generalised root identities and we investigate these in detail
for the special cases of \mu=0,-1\:\&\:-2. Unlike for \zeta, however, we show
that in the setting of zeta functions of curves over finite fields the \mu=-2
root identity is consistent with the Riemann hypothesis (RH) proved by Weil.
Comparison of this analysis with the corresponding calculations for \zeta
illuminates the fact that, even though both \zeta and \zeta_{k} have both Euler
and Hadamard product representations, it is the detailed structure of the
counting function, N(T), which drives the Cesaro computations on the root side
of these identities and thereby determines the implications of the root
identities for RH in each setting.

lyrics on the most recent IT hype: your software should ascend to the clouds.
There are many clouds and the stake is high. Distractedly, many of us became
assiduous users of the cloud, but perhaps due to the legacy systems and legacy
knowledge, IT professionals, mainly those many that work in business
information systems for the long tail, are not as much plunged into producing
cloud-based systems for their clients.
  This keynote will delve into several aspects of this cloud paradigm, from
more generic concerns regarding security and value for money, to more specific
worries that reach software engineers in general. Do we need a different
software development process? Are development techniques and tools mature
enough? What about the role of open-source in the cloud? How do we assess the
quality in cloud-based development? Please stay tuned for more!

the term 'item fairness'. In this paper a continuous measure of item unfairness
is proposed. The more the unfairness measure deviates from zero, the less fair
the item is. If the measure exceeds the cutoff value, the item is identified as
definitely unfair. The new approach can identify unfair items that would not be
identified with conventional procedures. The results are in accord with
experts' judgments on the item qualities. Since no assumptions about scores
distributions and/or correlations are assumed, the method is applicable to any
educational test. Its performance is illustrated through application to scores
of a real test.
