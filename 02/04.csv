algebras with integrals). Assume that $B$ is a right $A$-module algebra and
that $A$ is a left $B$-comodule coalgebra. If the action and coaction are
matched, it is possible to define a coproduct $\Delta_#$ on the smash product
$A # B$ making the pair $(A # B,\Delta_#)$ into an algebraic quantum group. In
this paper, we continue the study of these objects. First, we study the various
data of the bicrossproduct $A # B$, such as the modular automorphisms, the
modular elements, ... and obtain formulas in terms of the data of the
components $A$ and $B$. Secondly, we look at the dual of $A # B$ (in the sense
of algebraic quantum groups) and we show it is itself a bicrossproduct (of the
second type) of the duals $\hatA$ and $\hatB$. The result is immediate for
finite-dimensional Hopf algebras and therefore it is expected also for
algebraic quantum groups. However, it turns out that some aspects involve a
careful argument, mainly due to the fact that coproducts and coactions have
ranges in the multiplier algebras of the tensor products and not in the tensor
product itself. Finally, we also treat some examples in this paper. We have
included some of the examples that are known for finite-dimensional Hopf
algebras and show how they can also be obtained for more general algebraic
quantum groups. We also give some examples that are more typical for algebraic
quantum groups. In particular, we focus on the extra structure, provided by the
integrals and associated objects. It should be mentioned that with examples of
bicrossproducts of algebraic quantum groups, we do get examples that are
essentially different from those commonly known in Hopf algebra theory.

to as a group of Menger's paths from $S_i$ to $R_i$ in this paper. Although
within the same group they are edge-disjoint, the Menger's paths from different

paths appropriately, the number of mergings among different groups of Menger's
paths is always bounded by a constant, which is independent of the size and the
topology of $G$. The tightest such constant for the all the above-mentioned

related to the network encoding complexity for a variety of networks, such as
multicast networks, two-way networks and networks with multiple sessions of

to derive infrared luminosities and dust temperatures, we measure a dust
emissivity spectral index for SMGs of beta=2.0+/-0.2. Our results unveil the
diversity of the SMG population. Some SMGs exhibit extreme infrared
luminosities of ~10^13 Lsun and relatively warm dust components, while others
are fainter (~10^12 Lsun) and are biased towards cold dust temperatures. The
extreme infrared luminosities of some SMGs (LIR>10^12.7 Lsun, 26/61 systems)
imply SFRs of >500Msun yr^-1. Such high SFRs are difficult to reconcile with a
secular mode of star formation, and may instead correspond to a merger-driven
stage in the evolution of these galaxies. Another observational argument in
favour of this scenario is the presence of dust temperatures warmer than that
of SMGs of lower luminosities (~40K as opposed to ~25K), consistent with
observations of local ULIRGs triggered by major mergers and with results from
hydrodynamic simulations of major mergers combined with radiative transfer
calculations. Luminous SMGs are also offset from normal star-forming galaxies
in the stellar mass-SFR plane, suggesting that they are undergoing starburst
events with short duty cycles, compatible with the major merger scenario. On
the other hand, a significant fraction of the low infrared luminosity SMGs have
cold dust temperatures, are located close to the main sequence of star
formation, and thus might be evolving through a secular mode of star formation.

electron and positron beams are polarized. The positron source planned for the
International Linear Collider (ILC) is based on a helical undulator system and
can deliver a polarised beam with positron polarization of 60%. To ensure that
no significant polarization is lost during the transport of the electron and
positron beams from the source to the interaction region, spin tracking has to
be included in all transport elements which can contribute to a loss of
polarization. These are the positron source, the damping ring, the spin
rotators, the main linac and the beam delivery system. In particular, the
dynamics of the polarized positron beam is required to be investigated. The
results of positron spin tracking and depolarization study at the
Positron-Linac-To-Ring (PLTR) beamline are presented.

gravitational torques exerted by density fluctuations in the surrounding
turbulence. In particular, planetesimals in a disc supporting fully developed
magneto-rotational turbulence are readily excited to velocity dispersions above
the threshold for catastrophic disruption, halting planet formation. We aim to
examine the stirring of planetesimals lying instead in a magnetically-decoupled
midplane dead zone, stirred only by spiral density waves propagating out of the
disc's magnetically-coupled turbulent surface layers. We extend previous
studies to include a wider range of disc models, and explore the effects of
varying the disc column density and external magnetic field strength. [...] The
strength of the stirring is found to be independent of the gas surface density,
which is contrary to the increase with disc mass expected from a simple linear
wave picture. The discrepancy arises from the shearing out of density waves as
they propagate into the dead zone, resulting in density structures near the
midplane that exert weaker stochastic torques on average. We provide a simple
analytic fit to our numerically obtained torque amplitudes that accounts for
this effect. The stirring on the other hand depends sensitively on the net
vertical magnetic flux, up to a saturation level above which magnetic forces
dominate in the turbulent layers. For the majority of our models, the
equilibrium planetesimal velocity dispersions lie between the thresholds for
disrupting strong and weak aggregates, suggesting that collision outcomes will
depend on material properties. However, discs with relatively weak magnetic
fields yield reduced stirring, and their dead zones provide safe-havens even
for the weakest planetesimals against collisional destruction.

examine the Fe K spectral region in more detail and find support for two
distinct velocity components in the highly ionized absorber, with values
corresponding to the putative fast wind (~ 0.12c) and the post-shock flow (v ~
5000-7000 km/s). The Fe K absorption line structure is seen to vary on a
orbit-to-orbit timescale, apparently responding to both a short term increase
in ionizing flux and - perhaps more generally - to changes in the soft X-ray
(and simultaneous UV) luminosity. The latter result is particularly interesting
in providing independent support for the existence of shocked gas being cooled
primarily by Compton scattering of accretion disc photons. The Fe K emission is
represented by a narrow fluorescent line from near-neutral matter, with a weak

quasi-constant throughout the 45-day 2009 campaign, but is resolved, with a

also apply to the Sun. Indeed, observations and numerical simulations have
shown that strong heating at footpoints of loops, as is the case for active
regions, puts their coronae out of thermal equilibrium, which can lead to a
phenomenon known as catastrophic cooling. Following local pressure loss in the
corona, hot plasma locally condenses in these loops and dramatically cools down
to chromospheric temperatures. These blobs become bright in H-alpha and Ca II H
in time scales of minutes, and their dynamics seem to be subject more to
internal pressure changes in the loop rather than to gravity. They thus become
trackers of the magnetic field, which results in the spectacular coronal rain
that is observed falling down coronal loops. In this work we report on high
resolution observations of coronal rain with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT)
on Hinode and CRISP at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST). A statistical study
is performed in which properties such as velocities and accelerations of
coronal rain are derived. We show how this phenomenon can constitute a
diagnostic tool for the internal physical conditions inside loops. Furthermore,
we analyze transverse oscillations of strand-like condensations composing
coronal rain falling in a loop, and discuss the possible nature of the wave.
This points to the important role that coronal rain can play in the fields of
coronal heating and coronal seismology.

feedback in star-forming galaxies, injecting radiative and mechanical
luminosity into the ISM. H II regions may prove more important than supernovae
as triggers of star formation through localized compression of cold cloud
cores. In this review, I give a broad overview of the structure and
time-evolution of H II regions, emphasizing complications to the theoretical

mixtures of self-propelled particles. We consider two particle species, each of
which consisting of pointlike objects that propel with a velocity of constant
magnitude. Within each species, the particles try to achieve polar alignment of
their velocity vectors, whereas we analyze the cases of preferred polar,
antiparallel, as well as perpendicular alignment between particles of different
species. Our focus is on the effect that the interplay between the two species
has on the threshold densities for the onset of collective motion and on the
nature of the solutions above onset. For this purpose, we start from suitable
Langevin equations in the particle picture, from which we derive mean field
equations of the Fokker-Planck type and finally macroscopic continuum field
equations. We perform particle simulations of the Langevin equations, linear
stability analyses of the Fokker-Planck and macroscopic continuum equations,
and we numerically solve the Fokker-Planck equations. Both, spatially
homogeneous and inhomogeneous solutions are investigated, where the latter
correspond to stripe-like flocks of collectively moving particles. In general,
the interaction between the two species reduces the threshold density for the
onset of collective motion of each species. However, this interaction also
reduces the spatial organization in the stripe-like flocks. The most
interesting behavior is found for the case of preferred perpendicular alignment
between different species. There, a competition between polar and truly nematic
orientational ordering of the velocity vectors takes place within each particle
species. Finally, depending on the alignment rule for particles of different
species and within certain ranges of particle densities, identical and inverted
spatial density profiles can be found for the two particle species.

necessary to interpret its nucleosynthetic history, we seek to measure relative
abundance ratios of key elements (carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine) best
studied, or only available, using high-resolution spectra at infrared
wavelengths. High-resolution (R = 50,000) and high S/N infrared spectra were
acquired of nine red giant stars with Phoenix at the Gemini-South telescope.
Chemical abundances were calculated through a standard 1D local thermodynamic
equilibrium analysis using Kurucz model atmospheres. We derive [Fe/H] = -1.87
to -1.44, confirming at infrared wavelengths that M22 does present a [Fe/H]
spread. We also find large C and N abundance spreads, which confirm previous
results in the literature but based on a smaller sample. Our results show a
spread in A(C+N+O) of ~ 0.7 dex. Similar to mono-metallic GCs, M22 presents a
strong [Na/Fe]-[O/Fe] anticorrelation as derived from Na and CO lines in the K
band. For the first time we recover F abundances in M22 and find that it
exhibits a 0.6 dex variation. We find tentative evidence for a flatter
A(F)-A(O) relation compared to higher metallicity GCs. Our study confirms and
expands upon the chemical diversity seen in this complex stellar system. All
elements studied to date show large abundance spreads which require
contributions from both massive and low mass stars.

The flash memories have rather different properties compared with the rotary

systems. In this paper, we consider the problem of coding efficiency. We define
the ""coding-efficiency"" as the amount of information that one flash memory cell
can be used to record per cost. Because each flash memory cell can endure a
roughly fixed number of erases, the cost of data recording can be well-defined.
We define ""payload"" as the amount of information that one flash memory cell can
represent at a particular moment. By using information-theoretic arguments, we
prove a coding theorem for achievable coding rates. We prove an upper and lower
bound for coding efficiency. We show in this paper that there exists a
fundamental trade-off between ""payload"" and ""coding efficiency"". The results in

the propagation of erroneous data from a single corrupted node to the rest of

high-quality, moderate energy ion beams at low cost. Modeling of these
structures is challenging with conventional beam tracking codes because of the
large radial excursions of the beam and the significance of fringe field
effects. Numerous tune resonances are crossed during the acceleration, which
would lead to beam instability and loss in a storage ring. In a non-scaling
FFAG, the hope is that these resonances can be crossed sufficiently rapidly to
prevent beam loss. Simulations are required to see if this is indeed the case.
Here we simulate a non-scaling FFAG which accelerates protons from 31 to 250
MeV. We assume only that the bending magnets have mid-plane symmetry, with
specified vertical bending field in the mid-plane (y=0). The magnetic field can
be obtained everywhere using a power series expansion, and we develop
mathematical tools for calculating this expansion to arbitrary order when the
longitudinal field profile is given by an Enge function. We compare the use of
a conventional hard-edge fringe with a more accurate, soft-edge fringe field
model. The tune 1/3 resonance is the strongest, and crossing it in the
hard-edge fringe model results in a 21% loss of the beam. Using the soft-edge

focus on the variant with 45_H+126_H in the Higgs sector and show that there
are several regions in the parameter space of this model that can support
stable unifying configurations with the B-L breaking scale as high as 10^14
GeV, well above the previous generic estimates based on the minimal survival
hypothesis. This admits for a renormalizable implementation of the canonical
seesaw and makes the simplest potentially realistic scenario of this kind a
good candidate for a minimal SO(10) grand unification. Last, but not least,
this setting is likely to be extensively testable at future large-volume
facilities such as Hyper-Kamiokande.

predicted by Einstein's General Relativity. Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) are
well poised to detect low frequency ($10^{-9}$ -- $10^{-7}$ Hz) GWs in the near
future. There has been a significant amount of research into the detection of a
stochastic background of GWs from supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs).
Recent work has shown that single continuous sources standing out above the
background may be detectable by PTAs operating at a sensitivity sufficient to
detect the stochastic background. The most likely sources of continuous GWs in
the pulsar timing frequency band are extremely massive and/or nearby SMBHBs. In
this paper we present detection strategies including various forms of matched
filtering and power spectral summing. We determine the efficacy and
computational cost of such strategies. It is shown that it is computationally
infeasible to use an optimal matched filter including the poorly constrained
pulsar distances with a grid based method. We show that an Earth-term-matched
filter constructed using only the correlated signal terms is both
computationally viable and highly sensitive to GW signals. This technique is
only a factor of two less sensitive than the computationally unrealizable
optimal matched filter and a factor of two more sensitive than a power spectral
summing technique. We further show that a pairwise matched filter, taking the
pulsar distances into account is comparable to the optimal matched filter for
the single template case and comparable to the Earth-term-matched filter for
many search templates. Finally, using simulated data optimal quality, we place
a theoretical minimum detectable strain amplitude of $h>2\times 10^{-15}$ from
continuous GWs at frequencies on the order $\sim1/T_{\rm obs}$.

retain predictive power. Resummation follows after one factorizes the cross
section into the rele- vant modes. The class of observables which are sensitive
to soft recoil effects are particularly challenging to factorize and resum
since they involve rapidity logarithms. In this paper we will present a
formalism which allows one to factorize and resum the perturbative series for
such observables in a systematic fashion through the notion of a ""rapidity
renormalization group"". That is, a Collin-Soper like equation is realized as a
renormalization group equation, but has a more universal applicability to
observables beyond the traditional transverse momentum dependent parton
distribution functions (TMDPDFs) and the Sudakov form factor. This formalism
has the feature that it allows one to track the (non-standard) scheme
dependence which is inherent in any scenario where one performs a resummation
of rapidity divergences. We present a pedagogical introduction to the formalism
by applying it to the well-known massive Sudakov form factor. The formalism is
then used to study observables of current interest. A factorization theorem for
the transverse momentum distribution of Higgs production is presented along
with the result for the resummed cross section at NLL. Our formalism allows one
to define gauge invariant TMDPDFs which are independent of both the hard
scattering amplitude and the soft function, i.e. they are uni- versal. We
present details of the factorization and resummation of the jet broadening

neutrino-driven supernova explosions. This outcome and the time evolution of
the models basically agree with results previously obtained with the PROMETHEUS
hydro solver including an approximative treatment of relativistic effects by a
modified Newtonian potential. However, GR models exhibit subtle differences in
the neutrinospheric conditions compared to Newtonian and pseudo-Newtonian
simulations. These differences lead to significantly higher luminosities and
mean energies of the radiated electron neutrinos and antineutrinos and
therefore to larger energy-deposition rates and heating efficiencies in the
gain layer with favorable consequences for strong non-radial mass motions and
ultimately for an explosion. Moreover, energy transfer to the stellar medium
around the neutrinospheres through nucleon recoil in scattering reactions of
heavy-lepton neutrinos also enhances the mentioned effects. Together with
previous pseudo-Newtonian models the presented relativistic calculations
suggest that the treatment of gravity and energy-exchanging neutrino
interactions can make differences of even 50-100% in some quantities and is
likely to contribute to a finally successful explosion mechanism on no minor

Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM), but only for a very specific
relation between the trilinear parameter and the soft scalar mass, favouring A
~ -2m for a relatively light spectrum, and sizable values of tan(beta). We
describe here a string-derived scheme in which the first condition is automatic
and the second arises as a consequence of imposing radiative EW symmetry
breaking and viable neutralino dark matter in agreement with WMAP constraints.
More specifically, we consider modulus dominated SUSY-breaking in Type II
string compactifications and show that it leads to a very predictive CMSSM-like
scheme, with small departures due to background fluxes. Imposing the above
constraints leaves only one free parameter, which corresponds to an overall
scale. We show that in this construction $A=-3\sqrt{2}m\approx -2m$ and in the
allowed parameter space tan(beta)=38-41, leading to 119 GeV < m_h < 125 GeV. We
determine the detectability of this model and show that it could start being

Surfaces in the Outer Solar System (H/WTSOSS). The purpose of this survey was
to measure the surface properties of a large number of Kuiper belt objects and
attempt to infer compositional and dynamical correlations. We find that the
Centaurs and the low-perihelion scattered disk and resonant objects exhibit
virtually identical bifurcated optical colour distributions and make up two
well defined groups of object. Both groups have highly correlated optical and
NIR colours which are well described by a pair of two component mixture models
that have different red components, but share a common neutral component. The
small, $H_{606}\gtrsim5.6$ high-perihelion excited objects are entirely
consistent with being drawn from the two branches of the mixing model
suggesting that the colour bifurcation of the Centaurs is apparent in all small
excited objects. On the other hand, objects larger than $H_{606}\sim5.6$ are
not consistent with the mixing model, suggesting some evolutionary process
avoided by the smaller objects. The existence of a bifurcation amongst all
excited populations argues that the two separate classes of object existed in
the primordial disk before the excited Kuiper belt was populated. The cold
classical objects exhibit a different type of surface which has colours that
are consistent with being drawn from the red branch of the mixing model, but
with much higher albedos.

intercept are different from previous results obtained by a variational
analysis of semi-classical surfaces. We provide a physical interpretation of
the semi-classical worldsheets driving the Regge behavior for (-t)>0 in terms
of worldsheet instantons. The latter describe the Schwinger mechanism for

Our analysis naturally explains the diffusion in the impact parameter space
encoded in the Pomeron exchange; in our picture, it is due to the Unruh
temperature of accelerated strings under the electric field. We also argue for
the existence of a ""micro-fireball"" in the middle of the transverse space due
to the soft Pomeron exchange, which may be at the origin of the thermal
character of multiparticle production in ep/pp collisions. After summing over
uncorrelated multi-Pomeron exchanges, we find that the total dipole-dipole

interpretation, but also creates the opportunity to investigate accretion into
molecular clouds and many subsequent stages of star formation, all within one
small field of view. Understanding large complexes like Cygnus X is the key to
understanding the dominant role that massive star complexes play in galaxies
across the Universe.
  The main goal of this study is to establish feasibility of a high-resolution
CO survey of the entire Cygnus X region by observing part of it as a
Pathfinder, and to evaluate the survey as a tool for investigating the
star-formation process.
  A 2x4 degree area of the Cygnus X region has been mapped in the 12CO(3-2)
line at an angular resolution of 15"" and a velocity resolution of ~0.4km/s
using HARP-B and ACSIS on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. The star formation
process is heavily connected to the life-cycle of the molecular material in the
interstellar medium. The high critical density of the 12CO(3-2) transition
reveals clouds in key stages of molecule formation, and shows processes that
turn a molecular cloud into a star.
  We observed ~15% of Cygnus X, and demonstrated that a full survey would be
feasible and rewarding. We detected three distinct layers of 12CO(3-2)
emission, related to the Cygnus Rift (500-800 pc), to W75N (1-1.8 kpc), and to
DR21 (1.5-2.5 kpc). Within the Cygnus Rift, HI self-absorption features are
tightly correlated with faint diffuse CO emission, while HISA features in the
DR21 layer are mostly unrelated to any CO emission. 47 molecular outflows were
detected in the Pathfinder, 27 of them previously unknown. Sequentially
triggered star formation is a widespread phenomenon.

a set of strongly-connected and partially overlapping cliques. We introduce a

connectivity by testing the goodness of fit of the model they learn on new

give a good description only for very large and overlapping networks. These

consideration of the possibility of hidden variables in quantum mechanics.
Since it depends on predictions of single sets of measurements on three
particles, it eliminates the sampling loophole encountered by the Bell theorem
which requires a large number of observations to obtain a small number of
useful joint measurements. In evading this problem, the GHZ theorem is believed
to have confirmed Bell's historic conclusion that local hidden variables are
inconsistent with the results of quantum mechanics. The GHZ theorem depends on
predicting the results of sets of measurements of which only one may be
performed, i.e., counterfactuals. In the present paper, the non-commutative
aspects of these unperformed measurement sequences are critically examined.
Three classical examples and two variations on the GHZ construction are
analyzed to demonstrate that combined counter factual results of non-commuting
operations are in general logically inconsistent with performable measurement
sequences that take non-commutation into account. As a consequence, negative
conclusions regarding local hidden variables do not follow from the GHZ and
Bell theorems as historically reasoned.

to unidentified sources and a diffuse excess with respect to conventional
cosmic-ray propagation models. Two of the brightest TeV sources, MGRO J2019+37
and MGRO J2031+41, are analyzed using Milagro data with a new technique, and
their emission is tested under two different spectral assumptions: a power law
and a power law with an exponential cutoff. The new analysis technique is based
on an energy estimator that uses the fraction of photomultiplier tubes in the
observatory that detect the extensive air shower. The photon spectrum is
measured in the range 1 to 200 TeV using the last 3 years of Milagro data
(2005-2008), with the detector in its final configuration. MGRO J2019+37 is
detected with a significance of 12.3 standard deviations ($\sigma$), and is
better fit by a power law with an exponential cutoff than by a simple power
law, with a probability $>98$% (F-test). The best-fitting parameters for the
power law with exponential cutoff model are a normalization at 10 TeV of
$7^{+5}_{-2}\times10^{-10}$ $\mathrm{s^{-1}\: m^{-2}\: TeV^{-1}}$, a spectral
index of $2.0^{+0.5}_{-1.0}$ and a cutoff energy of $29^{+50}_{-16}$ TeV. MGRO
J2031+41 is detected with a significance of 7.3$\sigma$, with no evidence of a
cutoff. The best-fitting parameters for a power law are a normalization of
$2.4^{+0.6}_{-0.5}\times10^{-10}$ $\mathrm{s^{-1}\: m^{-2}\: TeV^{-1}}$ and a
spectral index of $3.08^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$. The overall flux is subject to an
$\sim$30% systematic uncertainty. The systematic uncertainty on the power law
indices is $\sim$0.1. A comparison with previous results from TeV J2032+4130,
MGRO J2031+41 and MGRO J2019+37 is also presented.

Given a connected graph G with nonnegative weights assigned to its vertices,

Alice's. The vertices are to be taken according to one (or both) of the
following two rules: (T) the subgraph of G induced by the taken vertices is
connected during the whole game, (R) the subgraph of G induced by the remaining

(1-epsilon) of the total weight of the vertices. This contrasts with the
original Pizza game played on a cycle, where Alice is known to have a strategy

  We show that the problem of deciding whether Alice has a winning strategy

PSPACE-complete if condition (R) or both conditions (T) and (R) are required.
We also consider a game played on connected graphs (without weights) where the

deciding who has the winning strategy is PSPACE-complete.

purpose use is to move beyond i) complete supervision, ii) low dimensional
data, iii) a single task and single view per instance. Solving these challenges
allows working with ""Big Data"" problems that are typically high dimensional
with multiple (but possibly incomplete) labelings and views. While other work
has addressed each of these problems separately, in this paper we show how to
address them together, namely semi-supervised dimension reduction for
multi-task and multi-view learning (SSDR-MML), which performs optimization for
dimension reduction and label inference in semi-supervised setting. The
proposed framework is designed to handle both multi-task and multi-view
learning settings, and can be easily adapted to many useful applications.
Information obtained from all tasks and views is combined via reconstruction
errors in a linear fashion that can be efficiently solved using an alternating
optimization scheme. Our formulation has a number of advantages. We explicitly
model the information combining mechanism as a data structure (a
weight/nearest-neighbor matrix) which allows investigating fundamental
questions in multi-task and multi-view learning. We address one such question
by presenting a general measure to quantify the success of simultaneous
learning of multiple tasks or from multiple views. We show that our SSDR-MML
approach can outperform many state-of-the-art baseline methods and demonstrate
the effectiveness of connecting dimension reduction and learning.

The players have contrasting

values and the minimizer substitutes them for variables of his choice. When the
expression is fully instantiated, its value is compared with a certain minimax
value that would result if the players played to their optimal strategies. The
winner is declared based on this comparison.
  We use a game tree to represent the state of the game and show how the
minimax value can be computed efficiently using backward induction and
alpha-beta pruning. The efficacy of alpha-beta pruning depends on the order in
which the nodes are evaluated. Further improvements can be obtained by using
transposition tables to prevent reevaluation of the same nodes. We propose a
heuristic for node ordering. We show how the use of the heuristic and
transposition tables lead to improved performance by comparing the number of
nodes pruned by each method.
  We describe some domain-specific variants of this game. The first is a graph
theoretic formulation wherein two players share a set of elements of a graph by
coloring a related set with each player looking to maximize his share. The set
being shared could be either the set of vertices, edges or faces (for a planar
graph). An application of this is the sharing of regions enclosed by a planar
graph where each player's aim is to maximize the area of his share. Another
variant is a tiling game where the players alternately place dominoes on a $8
\times 8$ checkerboard to construct a maximal partial tiling. We show that the
size of the tiling $x$ satisfies $22 \le x \le 32$ by proving that any maximal

erasures in network, with linear network coding. Subspace codes were introduced
by Koetter and Kschischang to correct errors and erasures in networks where
topology is unknown (the noncoherent case). In a previous work, we have
developed a family of subspace codes, based upon the Koetter-Kschichang
construction, which are efficiently list decodable. Using these codes, we
achieved a better decoding radius than Koetter-Kschischiang codes at low rates.
Herein, we introduce a new family of subspace codes based upon a different
approach which leads to a linear-algebraic list-decoding algorithm. The
resulting error correction radius can be expressed as follows: for any integer
$s$, our list-decoder using $s+1$-interpolation polynomials guarantees
successful recovery of the message subspace provided the normalized dimension
of errors is at most $s(1-sR)$. The same list-decoding algorithm can be used to
correct erasures as well as errors. The size of output list is at most
$Q^{s-1}$, where $Q$ is the size of the field that message symbols are chosen
from. Rank-metric codes are suitable for error correction in the case where the
network topology and the underlying network code are known (the coherent case).
Gabidulin codes are a well-known class of algebraic rank-metric codes that meet
the Singleton bound on the minimum rank metric of a code. In this paper, we
introduce a folded version of Gabidulin codes analogous to the folded
Reed-Solomon codes of Guruswami and Rudra along with a list-decoding algorithm
for such codes. Our list-decoding algorithm makes it possible to recover the
message provided that the normalized rank of error is at most $1-R-\epsilon$,
for any $\epsilon > 0$. Notably this achieves the information theoretic bound

giant radio galaxy with intermediate FR I/II radio properties. Our pointing
direction was centered on the gamma -ray emission peak recently discovered with
Fermi-LAT around the position of the north-west radio lobe 15 arcmin offset
from the nucleus. After subtracting two ""off-source"" pointings adjacent to the
radio lobe, and removing possible contaminants in the XIS field of view, we
found significant residual X-ray emission most likely diffuse in nature. The
spectrum of the excess X-ray emission is well fit by a power law with photon
index \Gamma = 1.90 +- 0.15 and a 0.5 - 8 keV flux of 4 x 10^{-13} erg cm^{-2}
s^{-1}. We interpret this diffuse X-ray emission component as being due to
inverse-Compton up-scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons by
ultrarelativistic electrons within the lobe, with only a minor contribution
from the beamed emission of the large-scale jet. Utilizing archival radio data
for the source, we demonstrate by means of broad-band spectral modeling that
the -ray flux of the Fermi-LAT source 2FGL J1629.4+8236 may well be accounted
for by the high-energy tail of the inverse-Compton continuum of the lobe. Thus,
this claimed association of gamma-rays from the north-west lobe of NGC6251,
together with the recent Fermi-LAT imaging of the extended lobes of Centaurus
A, indicates that particles may be efficiently (re-)accelerated up to
ultrarelativistic energies within extended radio lobes of nearby radio galaxies

that the superconducting gap function develops a directional dependence in

Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph ensemble. The main contribution of our work is
a combinatorial lower bound for the accumulate distribution of the minimum cut

derived here reflects the actual statistical behavior of the minimum cut

We further show that SR can occur even in a washboard potential, where
hysteresis loops normally do not close because of average drift of particles.
Upon correcting for the drift term, the closed hysteresis loop area (input
energy loss) shows the usual SR peaking behaviour as also the signal-to-noise

electrical spin injection from Fe Schottky contacts has been demonstrated in
previous works. In order to experimentally separate the strong ordinary Hall
effect signal from the iSHE in the semiconductor channel we developed epitaxial
ultrathin-Fe/GaAs contacts allowing for Hanle spin-precession measurements in
applied in-plane magnetic fields. Electrical injection and detection is
combined in our transistor structure with electrically manipulated spin
distribution and spin current which, unlike the previously utilized electrical
manipulations of the spin-orbit field or ballistic spin transit time, is well
suited for the diffusive 3D GaAs spin channel. The magnitudes and external

simultaneous spin detection by the non-local spin valve effect and modeled by
solving the drift-diffusion and Hall-cross response equations for the

this is a robustly star-forming, moderately enriched absorber, but with
relatively low dust depletion. Fitting of the SDSS spectrum yields low
reddening for Milky Way, LMC, or SMC extinction curves. No CO absorption is
detected, and C I absorption is weak. The low dust and molecular content,
reminiscent of some SMC sight-lines, may result from the lower metallicity, and
a stronger radiation field (due to higher SFR). Finally, we compare this

types of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, spams, and botnets. To reduce
the probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in traditional
security mechanisms like anti-virus and anti-spam software, sometimes also
known as \emph{self-defense} mechanisms. However, according to security
experts, such software (and their subsequent advancements) will not completely
eliminate risk. Recent research efforts have considered the problem of residual
risk elimination by proposing the idea of \emph{cyber-insurance}. In this
regard, an important research problem is resolving information asymmetry issues
associated with cyber-insurance contracts. In this paper we propose
\emph{three} mechanisms to resolve information asymmetry in cyber-insurance.
Our mechanisms are based on the \emph{Principal-Agent} (PA) model in
microeconomic theory. We show that (1) optimal cyber-insurance contracts
induced by our mechanisms only provide partial coverage to the insureds. This
ensures greater self-defense efforts on the part of the latter to protect their
computing systems, which in turn increases overall network security, (2) the
level of deductible per network user contract increases in a concave manner
with the topological degree of the user, and (3) a market for cyber-insurance
can be made to exist in the presence of monopolistic insurers under effective
mechanism design. Our methodology is applicable to any distributed network
scenario in which a framework for cyber-insurance can be implemented.

suitable risk-management technique for enhancing security in Internet-like

between the insurer and the insured, and the inter-dependent and correlated
nature of cyber risks have contributed in a big way to the failure of
cyber-insurance markets. Security experts have argued in favor of operating
system (OS) platform switching (ex., from Windows to Unix-based OSs) or secure
OS adoption as being one of the techniques that can potentially mitigate the
problems posing a challenge to successful cyber-insurance markets. In this
regard we model OS platform switching dynamics using a \emph{social gossip}
mechanism and study three important questions related to the nature of the
dynamics, for Internet-like distributed systems: (i) which type of networks
should cyber-insurers target for insuring?, (ii) what are the bounds on the
asymptotic performance level of a network, where the performance parameter is
an average function of the long-run individual user willingness to adopt secure
OSs?, and (iii) how can cyber-insurers use the topological information of their
clients to incentivize/reward them during offering contracts? Our analysis is
important to a profit-minded cyber-insurer, who wants to target the right
network, design optimal contracts to resolve information asymmetry problems,
and at the same time promote the increase of overall network security through
increasing secure OS adoption amongst users.

two dimensional network model for porous medium and introduce a wettability
alteration mechanism. A qualitative change in the steady state flow patterns,
destabilizing the percolating and trapped clusters, is observed as the system
wettability is varied. When capillary forces are strong a finite wettability
alteration is necessary to move the system from single-phase to two-phase flow
regime. For the case of both phases being mobile we find a linear relationship
between fractional flow and wettability alteration.

  regression",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many regularization schemes for high-dimensional regression have been put
forward. Most require the choice of a tuning parameter, using model selection
criteria or cross-validation schemes. We show that a simple non-negative or
sign-constrained least squares is a very simple and effective regularization
technique for a certain class of high-dimensional regression problems. The sign
constraint has to be derived via prior knowledge or an initial estimator but no
further tuning or cross-validation is necessary. The success depends on
conditions that are easy to check in practice. A sufficient condition for our
results is that most variables with the same sign constraint are positively
correlated. For a sparse optimal predictor, a non-asymptotic bound on the
L1-error of the regression coefficients is then proven. Without using any
further regularization, the regression vector can be estimated consistently as
long as \log(p) s/n -> 0 for n -> \infty, where s is the sparsity of the
optimal regression vector, p the number of variables and n sample size. Network
tomography is shown to be an application where the necessary conditions for
success of non-negative least squares are naturally fulfilled and empirical
results confirm the effectiveness of the sign constraint for sparse recovery.

spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) in a ferromagnetic (FM) metal layer, using the

  A correlation between the Rashba spin torque and the spatial spin current is

torque in a nano-sized ferromagnetic device. When local magnetism is turned on,
the out-of-plane (Sz) Spin Hall effect (SHE) is disrupted, but rather

allows an efficient transfer of spin momentum such that a typical switching

not lead to a appreciable reduction of the $\chi^2_{min}$. The analysis of AIC

still most preferred by the current data, and the DGP model is strongly
disfavored. In addition, from the observational constraints, we also
reconstruct the evolutions of the growth factor in these models. We find that
the current available growth factor data are not enough to distinguish these MG

discrete memoryless broadcast channel. To compute Marton's inner bound one has
to solve an optimization problem over a set of joint distributions on the input
and auxiliary random variables. The optimizers turn out to be structured in
many cases. Finding properties of optimizers not only results in efficient
evaluation of the region, but it may also help one to prove factorization of
Marton's inner bound (and thus its optimality). The first part of this paper
formulates this factorization approach explicitly and states some conjectures
and results along this line. The second part of this paper focuses primarily on
the structure of the optimizers. This section is inspired by a new binary
inequality that recently resulted in a very simple characterization of the
sum-rate of Marton's inner bound for binary input broadcast channels. This
prompted us to investigate whether this inequality can be extended to larger
cardinality input alphabets. We show that several of the results for the binary
input case do carry over for higher cardinality alphabets and we present a
collection of results that help restrict the search space of probability
distributions to evaluate the boundary of Marton's inner bound in the general
case. We also prove a new inequality for the binary skew-symmetric broadcast
channel that yields a very simple characterization of the entire Marton inner
bound for this channel.

the photoelectrons of the same kinetic energy emitted at different times.
Numerically exact computations on the hydrogen atom demonstrate that the
dynamic interference spectacularly modifies the photoionization process and is
prominently manifested in the photoelectron spectrum by the appearance of a
distinct multi-peak pattern. The general theory is shown to be well
approximated by explicit analytical expressions which allow for a transparent
understanding of the discovered phenomena and for making predictions on the
