thin films show diffuse but prominent phase transitions near 450 (+/-10) K and
550 K with dielectric loss temperature dependences that suggest skin layer
effects. The 450 K anomalies are near the ""transition"" first reported by
Polomska et al. [Phys. Stat. Sol. 23, 567 (1974)]. The 550 K anomalies coincide
with the surface phase transition recently reported [Xavi et al. PRL 106,
236101 (2011)]. In addition, anomalies are found at low temperatures: After
several experimental cycles the dielectric loss shows a clear relaxor-like
phase transition near what was previously suggested to be a spin reorientation
transition (SRT) temperature (~ 201 K) for frequencies 1 kHz < f < 1MHz which
follow a nonlinear Vogel-Fulcher (V-F) relation; an additional sharp anomaly is
observed near ~180 K at frequencies below 1 kHz. As emphasized recently by
Cowley et al. [Adv. Phys. 60, 229 (2011)], skin effects are expected for all
relaxor ferroelectrics. Using the interdigital electrodes, experimental data
and a theoretical model for in-plane longitudinal and transverse direct
magnetoelectric (ME) coefficient are presented.

towards its final solution. Two versions of the

correlation, except for the Pauli principle, is taken into account, and (b)
IPSM-b, where the highly excited hole states are considered to be
quasi-stationary and are described by Breit-Wigner distributions, whose widths
are estimated from the experimental data. We evaluate the coincidence spectra
in $^{4}_\Lambda$He, $^{5}_\Lambda$He, $^{12}_\Lambda$C, $^{16}_\Lambda$O, and
$^{28}_\Lambda$Si, as a function of the sum of kinetic energies
$E_{nN}=E_n+E_N$ for $N=n,p$. The recent Brookhaven National Laboratory
experiment E788 on $^4_\Lambda$He, is interpreted within the IPSM . We found
that the shapes of all the spectra are basically tailored by the kinematics of
the corresponding phase space, depending very weakly on the dynamics, which is
gauged here by the one-meson-exchange-potential. In spite of the
straightforwardness of the approach a good agreement with data is achieved.
This might be an indication that the final-state-interactions and the
two-nucleon induced processes are not very important in the decay of this
hypernucleus. We have also found that the $\pi+K$ exchange potential with soft
vertex-form-factor cutoffs $(\Lambda_\pi\approx 0.7$ GeV, $\Lambda_K\approx

theoretical models. In particular, it allows us to test (a) the formation of an
optically thick e+e- baryon plasma self-accelerating to Lorentz factors in the
range 200 < g < 3000; (b) its transparency condition with the emission of a
component of 10^{53-54} baryons in the TeV region and (c) the collision of
these baryons with the circumburst medium clouds, characterized by dimensions
of 10^{15-16} cm. In addition, these observations offer the possibility of
testing a new understanding of the thermal and power-law components in the
early phase of this GRB. We test the fireshell model of GRBs in one of the
closest (z = 0.54) and most energetic (Eiso = 2.90 x 10^{53} ergs) GRBs, namely
GRB 090618. We analyze its emission using several spectral models, with special
attention to the thermal and power-law components. We determine the fundamental
parameters of a canonical GRB within the context of the fireshell model. We
find evidences of the existence of two different episodes in GRB 090618. The
first episode lasts 50 s and is characterized by a spectrum consisting of
thermal component, which evolves between kT = 54 keV and kT = 12 keV. The
second episode, which lasts for \sim 100s, behaves as a canonical long GRB with
a Lorentz gamma factor at transparency of g = 495, a temperature at
transparency of 29.22 keV and with characteristic masses of the surrounding
clouds of \sim 10^{22-24} g. We support the recently proposed two-component
nature of GRB 090618 by using specific theoretical analysis and illustrate that
the episode 1 cannot be considered to be either a GRB or a part of a GRB event,
but it appears to be related to the progenitor of the collapsing bare core
leading to the formation of the black hole which we call a proto-black hole.

sure. To this end, we first establish a connection between two distinct
stochastic reach-avoid problems and three classes of stochastic optimal control
problems involving discontinuous payoff functions. Subsequently, we focus on
solutions of one of the classes of stochastic optimal control problems---the
exit-time problem, which solves both the two reach-avoid problems mentioned

for the corresponding value function; in this direction our contribution
compared to the existing literature is to develop techniques that admit
discontinuous payoff functions. Moreover, based on our DPP, we provide an
alternative characterization of the value function as a solution of a partial
differential equation in the sense of discontinuous viscosity solutions, along
with boundary conditions both in Dirichlet and viscosity senses. Theoretical
justifications are also discussed to pave the way for deployment of
off-the-shelf PDE solvers for numerical computations. Finally, we validate the

into various aspects of evolutionary processes and guidance for the study of
evolution. Until recently, empirical evidence on the ruggedness of these
landscapes was lacking, but since it became feasible to construct all possible
genotypes containing combinations of a limited set of mutations, the number of
studies has grown to a point where a classification of landscapes becomes
possible. The aim of this review is to identify measures of epistasis that
allow a meaningful comparison of fitness landscapes and then apply them to the
empirical landscapes to discern factors that affect ruggedness. The various
measures of epistasis that have been proposed in the literature appear to be
equivalent. Our comparison shows that the ruggedness of the empirical landscape
is affected by whether the included mutations are beneficial or deleterious and
by whether intra- or intergenic epistasis is involved. Finally, the empirical
landscapes are compared to landscapes generated with the Rough Mt.\ Fuji model.
Despite the simplicity of this model, it captures the features of the
experimental landscapes remarkably well.

environment is a key challenge for solid-state quantum information processing.
An idle qubit can be efficiently insulated from the outside world via dynamical
decoupling, as has recently been demonstrated for individual solid-state
qubits. However, protection of qubit coherence during a multi-qubit gate poses
a non-trivial problem: in general the decoupling disrupts the inter-qubit
dynamics, and hence conflicts with gate operation. This problem is particularly
salient for hybrid systems, wherein different types of qubits evolve and
decohere at vastly different rates. Here we present the integration of
dynamical decoupling into quantum gates for a paradigmatic hybrid system, the
electron-nuclear spin register. Our design harnesses the internal resonance in
the coupled-spin system to resolve the conflict between gate operation and
decoupling. We experimentally demonstrate these gates on a two-qubit register
in diamond operating at room temperature. Quantum tomography reveals that the
qubits involved in the gate operation are protected as accurately as idle
qubits. We further illustrate the power of our design by executing Grover's
quantum search algorithm, achieving fidelities above 90% even though the
execution time exceeds the electron spin dephasing time by two orders of
magnitude. Our results directly enable decoherence-protected interface gates
between different types of promising solid-state qubits. Ultimately, quantum
gates with integrated decoupling may enable reaching the accuracy threshold for
fault-tolerant quantum information processing with solid-state devices.

a statistical weight determined by the classical action and perform a
comprehensive analysis of their properties. In particular, we examine the
extent to which these ensembles capture topological and confinement properties
of the Yang-Mills vacuum. This further allows us to test the classic picture of
meron-induced quark confinement as triggered by dimeron dissociation. At small
bare couplings, spacial, topological-charge and color correlations among the
dimerons generate a short-range order which screens topological charges. With
increasing coupling this order weakens rapidly, however, in part because the
dimerons gradually dissociate into their meron constituents. Monitoring
confinement properties by evaluating Wilson-loop expectation values, we find
the growing disorder due to these progressively liberated merons to generate a
finite and (with the coupling) increasing string tension. The short-distance
behavior of the static quark-antiquark potential, on the other hand, is
dominated by small, ""instanton-like"" dimerons. String tension, action density
and topological susceptibility of the dimeron ensembles in the physical
coupling region turn out to be of the order of standard values. Hence the above
results demonstrate without reliance on weak-coupling or low-density
approximations that the dissociating dimeron component in the Yang-Mills vacuum
can indeed produce a meron-populated confining phase. The density of
coexisting, hardly dissociated and thus instanton-like dimerons seems to remain
large enough, on the other hand, to reproduce much of the additional
phenomenology successfully accounted for by non-confining instanton vacuum
models. Hence dimeron ensembles should provide an efficient basis for a rather
complete description of the Yang-Mills vacuum.

algorithmic techniques, namely Borel-fixed ideals. We determine an algorithm
computing all the saturated Borel-fixed ideals with Hilbert polynomial assigned
and we investigate their combinatorial properties. In Chapter 3 we show a new
type of flat deformations of Borel-fixed ideals which lead us to give a new
proof of the connectedness of the Hilbert scheme. In Chapter 4 we construct
families of ideals that generalize the notion of family of ideals sharing the
same initial ideal with respect to a fixed term ordering. Some of these
families correspond to open subsets of the Hilbert scheme and can be used to a
local study of the Hilbert scheme. In Chapter 6 we deal with the problem of the
connectedness of the Hilbert scheme of locally Cohen-Macaulay curves in the
projective 3-space. We show that one of the Hilbert scheme considered a ""good""
candidate to be non-connected, is instead connected. Moreover there are three
appendices that present and explain how to use the implementations of the

local capacity framework allows us to quantify the average information rate
received by a receiver node randomly located in the network. In this article,
the basic network model and analytical tools are first discussed and applied to
a simple network to derive the local capacity of various medium access schemes.
Our goal is to identify the most optimal scheme and also to see how does it
compare with more practical medium access schemes. We analyzed grid pattern
schemes where simultaneous transmitters are positioned in a regular grid
pattern, ALOHA schemes where simultaneous transmitters are dispatched according
to a uniform Poisson distribution and exclusion schemes where simultaneous
transmitters are dispatched according to an exclusion rule such as node
coloring and carrier sense schemes. Our analysis shows that local capacity is
optimal when simultaneous transmitters are positioned in a grid pattern based
on equilateral triangles and our results show that this optimal local capacity
is at most double the local capacity of ALOHA based scheme. Our results also
show that node coloring and carrier sense schemes approach the optimal local
capacity by an almost negligible difference. At the end, we also discuss the
shortcomings in our model as well as future research directions.

also different local d-wave amplitudes. These amplitudes are of the order of
magnitude of scanning tunneling microscopy measurements and they vanish at

charge domains reveal that the superconducting interaction is likely to be
scaled by the local free energy and capture the details of $T_c(t)$. The
accurately reproduction of these apparently disconnected phenomena establishes
routes to the important physical mechanisms involved in the connection between

that sits between the weak and strong disorder regimes. We call it the
intermediate disorder regime. It is accessed by scaling the inverse temperature
parameter $\beta$ to zero as the polymer length $n$ tends to infinity. The
natural choice of scaling is $\beta_n:=\beta n^{-1/4}$. We show that the
polymer measure under this scaling has previously unseen behavior. While the
fluctuation exponents of the polymer endpoint and the log partition function
are identical to those for simple random walk ($\zeta=1/2,\chi=0$), the
fluctuations themselves are different. These fluctuations are still influenced
by the random environment, and there is no self-averaging of the polymer
measure. In particular, the random distribution of the polymer endpoint
converges in law (under a diffusive scaling of space) to a random absolutely
continuous measure on the real line. The randomness of the measure is inherited
from a stationary process $A_{\beta}$ that has the recently discovered
crossover distributions as its one-point marginals, which for large $\beta$
become the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We also prove existence of a limiting
law for the four-parameter field of polymer transition probabilities that can
be described by the stochastic heat equation. In particular, in this weak noise
limit, we obtain the convergence of the point-to-point free energy fluctuations
to the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution. We emphasize that the scaling behaviour
obtained is universal and does not depend on the law of the disorder.

massive stellar evolution as well as being the progenitors of some of the most
luminous supernovae known. In this paper we provide a multiwavelength study of
the population of (candidate) LBVs identified within M33. New spectra provide
an observational baseline of >4yr with respect to published data, which is well
suited to identifying LBV outbursts. Multi-epoch optical and mid-IR surveys of
M33 further constrain the variability of the sample and permit a search for
dusty circumstellar ejecta. Spectroscopic and photometric variability appears
common amongst the sample, although in many cases further observations will be
required to determine its physical origin. Nevertheless, we report a new
outburst of M33 Var C, while the transition of the WNLh star B517 to a cooler B
supergiant phase between 1993-2010 confirms an LBV classification.
Proof-of-concept quantitative analysis is provided for Romano's star; the
results being consistent with the finding that its bolometric luminosity varies
during its LBV excursions. The combination of the temperature and luminosity of
two stars, the B hypergiant [HS80] 110A and the cool hypergiant B324, appears
to be in violation of the empirical Humphreys-Davidson limit. Mid-IR
observations demonstrate that a number of candidates appear associated with hot
circumstellar dust, although no objects as extreme as Eta Carinae are
identified. The combined multiwavelength dataset suggests that the population
of LBVs studied is contaminated by stars demonstrating the B[e] phenomenon. Of
these, a subset of optically faint, low luminosity stars associated with hot
dust are of particular interest since they appear similar to the likely
progenitors of SN 2008S and the 2008 NGC300 transient, albeit suffering less
intrinsic extinction. [ABRIDGED]

challenge is the high dimensionality of the problem: we determine the wave
energy density both as a function of the spatial coordinate and momentum (or
direction) space. The momentum variables are expressed in separable (polar)
coordinates facilitating the use of products of univariate basis expansions.
However this is not the case for the spatial argument and so we propose to make
use of automated mesh generating routines to both localise the approximation,
allowing quadrature costs to be kept moderate, and give versatility in the code
for different geometric configurations.

been observed at L to H transition in several tokamaks. Spontaneous reversal
has also been observed in TCV beyond a threshold in the density. We develop a
model based on the following phenomenology: (1) the increase of the gradient of
the pressure triggers formation on a fast time scale of cells of convection
(similar to Rayleigh-Benard (RB), but with a single sign of vorticity); (2)
poloidal rotation is induced by the envelope of the peripheric velocity of the
convection cells; via the baroclinic term the gradients of temperature and
density sustain the poloidal rotation against the decay due to the parallel
viscosity; (3) the fast increase of poloidal flow induces a high time
derivative of the radial electric field; (4) the neoclassical polarization
creates a series of parallel accelerations (kiks on each bounce) of the trapped
ions, leading to an increase of the toroidal precession or to its reversal; the
source of energy is the work done by the radial electric field. (5) the
diffusion transfers on resistive scale the toroidal momentum from the trapped
ions to the untrapped ones. The correlated interactions are examined and the
estimated time scales are found to be compatible with the observations.

distribution of quasar magnitudes shows a surprising intensity enhancement with
a ""bulls eye"" pattern toward (alpha,delta) ~ (195{\deg}, 0{\deg}) for all
wavelengths from UV through infrared. The angular pattern and size of the
enhancement is very similar for all wavelengths, which is inconsistent with a
Doppler shift due to a large peculiar velocity toward that direction. The shift
is also too large to explain as a systematic error in the quasar magnitudes.
The general features of the anomaly can be explained by the gravitational

and with the lens subtending an angle of \pm15{\deg} on the sky. It is

that the jet quenching is in general enhanced in presence of anisotropy

direction of the moving quark and the direction along which the momentum
broadening occurs. The jet quenching is strongly enhanced for a quark moving
along the anisotropic direction and momentum broadening happens along the

in the transverse plane and the broadening occurs on the same plane. The drag
force for quark motion parallel to the anisotropy is always enhanced. For
motion in the transverse space the drag force is enhanced compared to the
isotropic case only for quarks having velocity above a critical value. Below
this critical value the force is decreased. Moreover, the drag force along the
anisotropic direction is always stronger than the force in the transverse
space. The diffusion time follows exactly the inverse relations of the drag
forces. The static potential is decreased and stronger decrease observed for

cooling to 10 uK before sympathetically cooling with ultracold, bosonic 162Dy.
The temperature of the spin-polarized 161Dy is a factor T/TF=0.2 below the
Fermi temperature TF=300 nK. The co-trapped 162Dy concomitantly cools to
approximately Tc for Bose-Einstein condensation, thus realizing a novel, nearly

events at the LHC. The method is motivated by and works for theories with heavy
squarks and Wino-like LSPs (with nearly degenerate LSP and chargino). Such
theories are well motivated and their gluinos typically have a O(50%) branching
ratio to charged Winos. Observing the track of a long lived charged Wino
produced from gluino decay could give a clear identification of a gluino event.
Charged Wino NLSPs produced in colliders can be long-lived enough to leave a
reconstructable high pT charged track before decaying into a soft pion (or a
soft lepton) and the LSP, a signature with low SM background. By supplementing
the canonical gluino search strategy with a search for these stiff chargino
tracks, our results suggest it will be possible to find gluinos with
significantly less luminosity. In addition, we describe a procedure for
obtaining a kinematic measurement of the gluino mass using the three momenta of
the reconstructed chargino tracks. With measurements of the gluino mass and
cross section, it will be possible to determine the gluino spin, and confirm
that the excess events are indeed due to a spin 1/2 superpartner. It may also
be possible to use these stiff Wino tracks to obtain an approximate measurement
of the chargino mass, and therefore the LSP (dark matter) mass.

However, at fixed group/cluster mass, the stellar masses of the fossil galaxies
are larger compared to normal BCGs, a fact that holds true over a wide range of

including loops, which are often interpreted as relics of satellite infall in
the main galaxy's potential well. In most cases, however, the residual nucleus
of the satellite is not seen, although it is predicted by numerical
simulations. We test whether such faint and extended features can be associated
to gas-rich, major mergers, which may also lead to disc rebuilding and thus be
a corner stone for the formation of spiral galaxies. Using the TreeSPH code
GADGET-2, we model the formation of an almost bulge-less galaxy similar to NGC
5907 (B/T $\le$ 0.2) after a gas-rich major merger. We indeed find that 3:1
major mergers can form features similar to the loops found in many galactic
haloes, including in NGC 5907, and can reproduce an extended thin disc, a
bulge, as well as the pronounced warp of the gaseous disc. Even though it
remains difficult to fully cover the large volume of free parameters, the
present modelling of the loops in NGC 5907 proves that they could well be the
result of a major merger. It has many advantages over the satellite infall
scenario; e.g., it solves the problem of the visibility of the satellite
remnant, and it may explain some additional features in the NGC 5907 halo, as
well as some gas properties of this system. For orbital parameters derived from
cosmological simulations, the loops in NGC 5907 can be reproduced by major
mergers (3:1 to 5:1) and possibly by intermediate mergers (5:1 to 12:1). The
major merger scenario thus challenges the minor merger one and could explain
many properties that haloes of spiral galaxies have in common, including their
red colours and the presence of faint extended features.

Using HST images we have detected the angular expansion of these knots and
derived an age of 850+280-150 yr. To investigate the spectral and spatial
properties of the soft X-ray emission detected by ROSAT, we have obtained
Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of A30. The X-ray emission from A30 can be
separated into two components: a point-source at the central star and diffuse
emission associated with the hydrogen-poor knots and the cloverleaf structure
inside the nebular shell. To help us assess the role of the current stellar
wind in powering this X-ray emission, we have determined the stellar parameters
of the central star of A 30 using a non-LTE model fit to its optical and UV
spectrum. The spatial distribution and spectral properties of the diffuse X-ray
emission is suggestive that it is generated by the post-born-again and present
fast stellar winds interacting with the hydrogen-poor ejecta of the born-again
event. This emission can be attributed to shock-heated plasma, as the
hydrogen-poor knots are ablated by the stellar winds, under which circumstances
the efficient mass-loading of the present fast stellar wind raises its density
and damps its velocity to produce the observed diffuse soft X-rays. Charge
transfer reactions between the ions of the stellar winds and material of the
born-again ejecta has also been considered as a possible mechanism for the
production of diffuse X-ray emission, and upper limits on the expected X-ray
production by this mechanism have been derived. The origin of the X-ray
emission from the central star of A 30 is puzzling: shocks in the present fast
stellar wind and photospheric emission can be ruled out, while the development
of a new, compact hot bubble confining the fast stellar wind seems implausible.

an integral-field spectrograph with a uniquely wide field of view (107x107 sq
arcsec), allowing us to achieve remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios of
~20-70 per pixel in radial bins of 2-2.5 times the effective radii of the eight
galaxies in our sample. Focusing on a sample of massive elliptical galaxies
with stellar velocity dispersions sigma* > 150 km/s, we study the radial
dependence in the equivalent widths (EWs) of key metal absorption lines. By
twice the effective radius, the Mgb EWs have dropped by ~50%, and only a weak
correlation between sigma* and Mgb EW remains. The Mgb EWs at large radii are
comparable to those seen in the centers of elliptical galaxies that are
approximately an order of magnitude less massive. We find that the well-known
metallicity gradients often observed within an effective radius continue
smoothly to 2.5R_e, while the abundance ratio gradients remain flat. Much like
the halo of the Milky Way, the stellar halos of our galaxies have low
metallicities and high alpha-abundance ratios, as expected for very old stars
formed in small stellar systems. Our observations support a picture in which
the outer parts of massive elliptical galaxies are built by the accretion of
much smaller systems whose star formation history was truncated at early times.

the two eclipsing binary systems known to date to contain stars with masses low
enough to have fully convective interiors. We are able to model satisfactorily
the system KOI-126, finding consistent solutions for the radii and surface
temperatures of all three components, using a solar-like value of the
mixing-length parameter \alpha in the convection zone, and PHOENIX NextGen 1D
model atmospheres for the surface boundary conditions. Depending on the
chemical composition, we estimate the age of the system to be in the range 3-5
Gyr. For CM Draconis, on the other hand, we cannot reconcile our models with
the observed radii and T_eff using the current metal-poor composition estimate
based on kinematics. Higher metallicities lessen but do not remove the
discrepancy. We then explore the effect of varying the mixing length parameter
\alpha. As previously noted in the literature, a reduced \alpha can be used as
a simple measure of the lower convective efficiency due to rotation and induced
magnetic fields. Our models show a sensitivity to \alpha (for \alpha < 1.0)
sufficient to partially account for the radius discrepancies. It is, however,
impossible to reconcile the models with the observations on the basis of the
effect of the reduced \alpha alone. We therefore suggest that the combined
effects of high metallicity and \alpha reduction could explain the observations
of CM Draconis. For example, increasing the metallicity of the system towards
super-solar values (i.e. Z = 2 Z_sun) yields an agreement within 2 \sigma with
\alpha = 1.0.

enhancement modulated by the orbital period, interpreted as caused by
Star-Planet Interactions (SPIs). One possible cause of SPIs is the large-scale
magnetic field of the host star in which the close-in giant planet orbits.
  In this paper we present spectropolarimetric observations of HD 179949 during
two observing campaigns (2009 September and 2007 June). We detect a weak
large-scale magnetic field of a few Gauss at the surface of the star. The field
configuration is mainly poloidal at both observing epochs. The star is found to
rotate differentially, with a surface rotation shear of dOmega=0.216\pm0.061
rad/d, corresponding to equatorial and polar rotation periods of 7.62\pm0.07
and 10.3\pm0.8 d respectively. The coronal field estimated by extrapolating the
surface maps resembles a dipole tilted at ~70 degrees. We also find that the
chromospheric activity of HD 179949 is mainly modulated by the rotation of the
star, with two clear maxima per rotation period as expected from a highly
tilted magnetosphere. In September 2009, we find that the activity of HD 179949
shows hints of low amplitude fluctuations with a period close to the beat

ages for the stars. With accompanying photometric and radio data we have
measured the structural parameters of the stellar and gaseous populations over
the full galaxy. The stellar populations show an intrinsically thick
configuration with $0.39 \leq q_{0} \leq 0.57$. The stellar rotation in WLM is
measured to be $17 \pm 1$ km s$^{-1}$, however the ratio of rotation to
pressure support for the stars is $V/\sigma \sim 1$, in contrast to the gas
whose ratio is seven times larger. This, along with the structural data and
alignment of the kinematic and photometric axes, suggests we are viewing WLM as
a highly inclined oblate spheroid. Stellar rotation curves, corrected for
asymmetric drift, are used to compute a dynamical mass of $4.3\pm
0.3\times10^{8} $M$_{\odot}$ at the half light radius ($r_{h} = 1656 \pm 49$
pc). The stellar velocity dispersion increases with stellar age in a manner
consistent with giant molecular cloud and substructure interactions producing
the heating in WLM. Coupled with WLM's isolation, this suggests that the
extended vertical structure of its stellar and gaseous components and increase
in stellar velocity dispersion with age are due to internal feedback, rather
than tidally driven evolution. These represent some of the first observational
results from an isolated Local Group dwarf galaxy which can offer important
constraints on how strongly internal feedback and secular processes modulate SF

also known as Nicolai map, topological field theory (TFT) and its relation to
localization and Morse-Smale-Floer homology, with an emphasis both on the
mathematical aspects and the physical meaning. These concepts, assembled in a
new way, enter a line of attack to the problem of the mass gap in large-N SU(N)
YM, that is reviewed as well. In the large-N limit of pure SU(N) YM the ambient
algebra of Wilson loops is known to be a type II_1 non-hyperfinite factor.
Nevertheless, for the mass gap problem at the leading 1/N order, only the
subalgebra of local gauge-invariant single-trace operators matters. The
connected two-point correlators in this subalgebra must be an infinite sum of
propagators of free massive fields, a vast simplification. It is an open
problem, determined by the grow of the degeneracy of the spectrum, whether the
aforementioned local subalgebra is in fact hyperfinite. For the mass-gap
problem, in the search of a hyperfinite subalgebra containing the scalar sector
of large-N YM, a major role is played by the existence of a TFT underlying the
large-N limit of YM, with twisted boundary conditions on a torus or, what is
the same by Morita duality, on a non-commutative torus.

branch (RGB) stars and 23 potential inner disk red clump stars located in
Plaut-s low extinction window. We also measure lithium for a super Li-rich RGB
star. The abundances were determined by spectrum synthesis of high resolution
(R~25,000), high signal-to-noise (S/N~50-100 pixel-1) spectra obtained with the
Blanco 4m telescope and Hydra multifiber spectrograph. For the bulge RGB stars,
we find a general increase in the [Na/Fe] and [Na/Al] ratios with increasing
metallicity, and a similar decrease in [La/Fe] and [Nd/Fe]. Additionally, the
[Al/Fe] and [Eu/Fe] abundance trends almost identically follow those of the
{\alpha}-elements, and the [Zr/Fe] ratios exhibit relatively little change with
[Fe/H]. The consistently low [La/Eu] ratios of the RGB stars indicate that at
least a majority of bulge stars formed rapidly (<1 Gyr) and before the main
s-process could become a significant pollution source. In contrast, we find
that the potential inner disk clump stars exhibit abundance patterns more
similar to those of the thin and thick disks. Comparisons between the abundance
trends at different bulge locations suggest that the inner and outer bulge
formed on similar timescales. However, we find evidence of some abundance
differences between the most metal-poor and metal-rich stars in various bulge
fields. The data also indicate that the halo may have had a more significant
impact on the outer bulge initial composition than the inner bulge composition.
The [Na/Fe] and to a lesser extent [La/Fe] abundances further indicate that the
metal-poor bulge, at least at ~1 kpc from the Galactic center, and thick disk
may not share an identical chemistry.

learning at a population level. Although decision-making by individual neurons
has been extensively studied, questions regarding how neurons should behave to
cooperate effectively remain largely unaddressed. Under assumptions that
capture a few basic features of cortical neurons, we show that constraining
reward maximization by metabolic cost aligns the information content of actions
with their expected reward. Thus, metabolic cost provides a mechanism whereby
neurons encode expected reward into their outputs. Further, aside from reducing
energy expenditures, imposing a tight metabolic constraint also increases the
accuracy of empirical estimates of rewards, increasing the robustness of
distributed learning. Finally, we present two implementations of metabolically
constrained learning that confirm our theoretical finding. These results
suggest that metabolic cost may be an organizing principle underlying the
neural code, and may also provide a useful guide to the design and analysis of
other cooperating populations.

dimensional space time, where we solved the effective four-dimensional
equations from the five-dimensional equations together with the junction and
boundary conditions. Four dimensional cosmic strings show some serious problems
concerning the mechanism of string smoothing related to the string mass per
unit length, $G\mu \leq 10^{-6}$. Moreover, there is no observational evidence
of axially symmetric lensing effect caused by cosmic strings. Also
super-massive cosmic strings ($G\mu\gtrsim 1$), predicted by superstring
theory, possess some problems. They are studied because the universe may have
undergone phase transitions at scales much higher than the GUT scale. But $G\mu
\gtrsim 1$ is far above observational bounds, so one needs an inflationary
scenario to smooth them out. Further, it is believed that these super-massive
strings could never have extended to macroscopic size. Brane-world models could
overcome these problems. $G\mu$ could be warped down to GUT scale, even if its
value was at the Planck scale.
  In our warped cosmic string model, where the string mass per unit length in
the bulk can be of order of the Planck scale, we find that the four dimensional
brane space time is exponential warped down. Moreover, asymptotically the
induced four dimensional space time doesn't show conical behavior. So there is
no angle deficit compared to its value in the bulk and the space time seems to
be un-physical, at least under fairly weak assumptions on the stress-energy
tensor and without a positive brane tension. The results are confirmed by
numerical solutions of the field equations.

shaping the nature of the turbulence in the interstellar medium (ISM) of our
galaxy. The heating and cooling cause it to be highly compressible, and, in
some regimes of density and temperature, to become thermally unstable, tending
to spontaneously segregate into warm/diffuse and cold/dense phases. On the
other hand, turbulence is an inherently mixing process, tending to replenish
the density and temperature ranges that would be forbidden under thermal
processes alone. The turbulence in the ionized ISM appears to be transonic
(i.e, with Mach numbers $\Ms \sim 1$), and thus to behave essentially
incompressibly. However, in the neutral medium, thermal instability causes the
sound speed of the gas to fluctuate by up to factors of $\sim 30$, and thus the
flow can be highly supersonic with respect to the dense/cold gas, although
numerical simulations suggest that this behavior corresponds more to the
ensemble of cold clumps than to the clumps' internal velocity dispersion.
Finally, coherent large-scale compressions in the warm neutral medium (induced
by, say, the passage of spiral arms or by supernova shock waves) can produce
large, dense molecular clouds that are subject to their own self-gravity, and
begin to contract gravitationally. Because they are populated by nonlinear
density fluctuations, whose local free-fall times are significantly smaller
than that of the whole cloud, the fluctuations terminate their collapse
earlier, giving rise to a regime of hierarchical gravitational fragmentation,
with small-scale collapses occurring within larger-scale ones. Thus, the
""turbulence"" in molecular clouds may be dominated by a gravitationally
contracting component at all scales.

used web applications today tend toward centralization. Control increasingly
rests with centralized service providers who, as a consequence, have also
amassed unprecedented amounts of data about the behaviors and personalities of
individuals.
  Developers, regulators, and consumer advocates have looked to alternative
decentralized architectures as the natural response to threats posed by these
centralized services. The result has been a great variety of solutions that
include personal data stores (PDS), infomediaries, Vendor Relationship
Management (VRM) systems, and federated and distributed social networks. And
yet, for all these efforts, decentralized personal data architectures have seen
little adoption.
  This position paper attempts to account for these failures, challenging the
accepted wisdom in the web community on the feasibility and desirability of
these approaches. We start with a historical discussion of the development of
various categories of decentralized personal data architectures. Then we survey
the main ideas to illustrate the common themes among these efforts. We tease
apart the design characteristics of these systems from the social values that
they (are intended to) promote. We use this understanding to point out numerous
drawbacks of the decentralization paradigm, some inherent and others
incidental. We end with recommendations for designers of these systems for
working towards goals that are achievable, but perhaps more limited in scope
and ambition.

items enters a buffer with limited capacity $k$. When the buffer is full, one

This step is repeated until the input sequence is exhausted and the buffer is
empty. The objective is to find a sequence of removals that minimizes the total

applications in computer and production systems, and is known to be NP-hard.
  We give the first constant factor approximation guarantee for RBM. Our
algorithm is based on an intricate ""rounding"" of the solution to an LP

integrality gap of this relaxation. Our results improve upon the best previous

challenge to describe deterministic finite systems which take part in networks
of nondeterministic interactions. The traditional approach to describe
processes as stepwise executable activities which are not based on the
ordinarily nondeterministic interaction shows strong centralization tendencies.
As suggested in this article, viewing processes and their interactions as
complementary can circumvent these centralization tendencies.
  The description of both, processes and their interactions is based on the
same building blocks, namely finite input output automata (or transducers).
Processes are viewed as finite systems that take part in multiple, ordinarily
nondeterministic interactions. The interactions between processes are described
as protocols.
  The effects of communication between processes as well as the necessary
coordination of different interactions within a processes are both based on the
restriction of the transition relation of product automata. The channel based
outer coupling represents the causal relation between the output and the input
of different systems. The coordination condition based inner coupling
represents the causal relation between the input and output of a single system.
  All steps are illustrated with the example of a network of resource
administration processes which is supposed to provide requesting user processes
exclusive access to a single resource.

and otherwise produces a counter-example explaining the violation. The verified
properties are formally expressed in temporal logics. Some temporal logics,
such as CTL, are branching: they allow to express facts about the whole
computation tree of the model, rather than on each single linear computation.
This branching aspect is even more critical when dealing with multi-modal
logics, i.e. logics expressing facts about systems with several transition
relations. A prominent example is CTLK, a logic that reasons about temporal and
epistemic properties of multi-agent systems. In general, model checkers produce
linear counter-examples for failed properties, composed of a single computation
path of the model. But some branching properties are only poorly and partially
explained by a linear counter-example.
  This paper proposes richer counter-example structures called tree-like
annotated counter-examples (TLACEs), for properties in Action-Restricted CTL
(ARCTL), an extension of CTL quantifying paths restricted in terms of actions
labeling transitions of the model. These counter-examples have a branching
structure that supports more complete description of property violations.
Elements of these counter-examples are annotated with parts of the property to
give a better understanding of their structure. Visualization and browsing of
these richer counter-examples become a critical issue, as the number of
branches and states can grow exponentially for deeply-nested properties.
  This paper formally defines the structure of TLACEs, characterizes adequate
counter-examples w.r.t. models and failed properties, and gives a generation
algorithm for ARCTL properties. It also illustrates the approach with examples
in CTLK, using a reduction of CTLK to ARCTL. The proposed approach has been
implemented, first by extending the NuSMV model checker to generate and export
branching counter-examples, secondly by providing an interactive graphical
interface to visualize and browse them.

Recently, it was suggested by De Pontieu et al. that there were two types of
spicules with very different dynamic properties, which were detected by space-
time plot technique in the Ca ii H line (3968 A) wavelength from Hinode/SOT
observations. 'Type I' spicule, with a 3-7 minute lifetime, undergoes a cycle
of upward and downward motion; in contrast, 'Type II' spicule fades away within
dozens of seconds, without descending phase. We are motivated by the fact that
for a spicule with complicated 3D motion, the space-time plot, which is made
through a slit on a fixed position, could not match the spicule behavior all
the time and might lose its real life story. By revisiting the same data sets,
we identify and trace 105 and 102 spicules in quiet sun (QS) and coronal hole
(CH), respectively, and obtain their statistical dynamic properties. First, we
have not found a single convincing example of 'Type II' spicules. Secondly,
more than 60% of the identified spicules in each region show a complete cycle,
i.e., majority spicules are 'Type I'. Thirdly, the lifetime of spicules in QS
and CH are 148 s and 112 s, respectively, but there is no fundamental lifetime
difference between the spicules in QS and CH reported earlier. Therefore, the
suggestion of coronal heating by 'Type II' spicules should be taken with
cautions. Subject headings: Sun: chromosphere Sun:transition region Sun:corona

data covering the period 1995-2011 are analyzed to document the transition into
a new phase of circumstellar disk activity in the classical Be-shell star 48
Lib. The long-term disk evolution is described using the V/R ratio of the
violet and red emission components of H alpha and Br gamma, radial velocities
and profiles of He I and optical metal shell lines, multi-band BVRI
polarimetry, broad-band and high-resolution interferometric visibilities and
phases. Spectroscopic signatures of disk asymmetries in 48 Lib vanished in the
late nineties but recovered some time between 2004 and 2007. Variations in the
radial velocity and line profile of conventional shell lines correlate with the
V/R behavior. They are shared by narrow absorption cores superimposed on
otherwise seemingly photospheric He I lines, which may form in high-density gas
at the inner disk close to the photosphere. Large radial velocity variations
continued also during the V/R-quiet years. The broad H-band interferometry
gives a disk diameter of (1.72+-0.2) mas (equivalent to 15 stellar radii),
position angle of the disk (50+-9) deg and a relatively low disk flattening of
1.66+-0.3. Within the errors the same disk position angle is derived from
polarimetric observations and from photocenter shifts across Br gamma. The
high-resolution interferometric visibility and phase profiles show a double or
even multiple-component structure. A preliminary estimate based on the size of
the Br gamma emitting region indicates a large diameter for the disk (tens of
stellar radii).

the V-I characteristics and the distributions of switching and retrapping
currents upon varying the shunt resistor and temperature. Theoretical analysis
of the experiments indicates that as the value of the shunt resistance is
decreased, the dynamics turns more coherent presumably due to stabilization of
phase-slip centers in the wire and furthermore the switching current approaches
the Bardeen's prediction for equilibrium depairing current. By a detailed
comparison between theory and experimental, we make headway into identifying
regimes in which the quasi-one-dimensional wire can effectively be described by
a zero-dimensional circuit model analogous to the RCSJ (resistively and

CO has not been efficiently destroyed by reactions with ionized He or the
energetic electrons created by the decay of the radiative nuclei. Our CO
detection thus implies that less carbon is available to form carbonaceous dust

loop-like prominence during its eruption. We use multi-instrument observations
from AIA/SDO, EUVI/STEREO and LASCO/SoHO. The kinematic, morphological,
geometrical, and helicity evolution of a loop-like eruptive prominence are
studied in the context of the magnetic flux rope model of solar prominences.
The prominence eruption evolved as a height expanding twisted loop with both
legs anchored in the chromosphere of a plage area. The eruption process
consists of a prominence activation, acceleration, and a phase of constant
velocity. The prominence body was composed of left-hand (counter-clockwise)
twisted threads around the main prominence axis. The twist during the eruption
was estimated at 6pi (3 turns). The prominence reached a maximum height of 526
Mm before contracting to its primary location and partially reformed in the
same place two days after the eruption. This ejection, however, triggered a CME
seen in LASCO C2. The prominence was located in the northern periphery of the
CME magnetic field configuration and, therefore, the background magnetic field
was asymmetric with respect to the filament position. The physical conditions
of the falling plasma blobs were analysed with respect to the prominence
kinematics. The same sign of the prominence body twist and writhe, as well as
the amount of twisting above the critical value of 2pi after the activation
phase indicate that possibly conditions for kink instability were present. No

Two distinct mechanisms are known for their origins: ($a$) Stochastic
single-molecule events, such as gene expression, with slow gene on-off
dynamics; and ($b$) nonlinear networks with feedbacks. These two mechanisms
yield different volume dependence for the sojourn time of an attractor. As in
the classic Arrhenius theory for temperature dependent transition rates, a
landscape perspective provides a natural framework for the system's behavior.
However, due to the nonequilibrium nature of the open chemical systems, the
landscape, and the attractors it represents, are all themselves {\em emergent
properties} of complex, mesoscopic dynamics. In terms of the landscape, we show
a generalization of Kramers' approach is possible to provide a rate theory. The
emergence of attractors is a form of self-organization in the mesoscopic
system; stochastic attractors in biochemical systems such as gene regulation

from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments. The main difference
between our approach and the traditional 14-moment approximation is that we
will not close the fluid-dynamical equations of motion by truncating the
expansion of the distribution function. Instead, we keep all terms in the
moment expansion. The reduction of the degrees of freedom is done by
identifying the microscopic time scales of the Boltzmann equation and
considering only the slowest ones. In addition, the equations of motion for the
dissipative quantities are truncated according to a systematic power-counting
scheme in Knudsen and inverse Reynolds number. We conclude that the equations
of motion can be closed in terms of only 14 dynamical variables, as long as we
only keep terms of second order in Knudsen and/or inverse Reynolds number. We
show that, even though the equations of motion are closed in terms of these 14
fields, the transport coefficients carry information about all the moments of
the distribution function. In this way, we can show that the particle-diffusion
and shear-viscosity coefficients agree with the values given by the
Chapman-Enskog expansion.

in terms of the wavelength and the frequency of the incident and the scattered
photons respectively using the familiar particle interpretation of the Compton
effect, where initially the electron is at rest and its spin is ignored. Both

Broglie wavelength, wave and clock frequency of the scattered electron are
calculated for an incident photon energy that was used in the original
experiment of Compton as a function of the scattering angle of the recoiled

for the de Broglie wavelength of the recoiled electron under these conditions,
the minimum value obtained is in the range of X-rays. The non-relativistic de
Broglie wave frequency obtained by neglecting the rest mass of the electron
leads to an underestimation of its value. The implications of de Broglie

discussed and possible extensions of the obtained mathematical formulations are
indicated. The results are useful for understanding the wave-particle duality

effect. Here we develop an analytical approach for this transition, based on
the theory of conformal restriction. This is a mathematical theory that was
recently developed within the context of the Schramm-Loewner evolution which
describes the stochastic geometry of fractal curves and other stochastic
geometrical fractal objects in 2D space. Observables elucidating the connection
with the plateau transition include the so-called point-contact conductances
(PCCs) between points on the boundary of the sample, described within the
language of the Chalker-Coddington network model. We show that the
disorder-averaged PCCs are characterized by classical probabilities for certain
geometric objects in the plane (pictures), occurring with positive statistical
weights, that satisfy the crucial restriction property with respect to changes
in the shape of the sample with absorbing boundaries. Upon combining this
restriction property with the expected conformal invariance at the transition
point, we employ the mathematical theory of conformal restriction measures to
relate the disorder-averaged PCCs to correlation functions of primary operators
in a conformal field theory (of central charge $c=0$). We show how this can be
used to calculate these functions in a number of geometries with various
boundary conditions. Since our results employ only the conformal restriction
property, they are equally applicable to a number of other critical disordered
electronic systems in 2D. For most of these systems, we also predict exact
values of critical exponents related to the spatial behavior of various
disorder-averaged PCCs.

\tau\to+\infty. Ellipticity permits to construct parametrices that are inverses

remnant of a galaxy merger. It shows a Seyfert 2 nucleus and intense star
formation according to optical spectroscopic observations. We have studied this
galaxy using new Herschel far-IR imaging data in addition to archival X-ray,
UV, optical, near-IR and mid-IR data. Mid- and far-IR data are crucial to
characterise the starburst contribution, allowing us to shed new light on its
nature and to study the coexistence of AGN and starburst activity in the local
Universe. The decomposition of the mid-IR Spitzer spectrum shows that the AGN
bolometric contribution to the mid-IR and total infrared luminosity is small
(Lbol(AGN)/LIR~0.02), which agrees with previous estimations. We have
characterised the physical nature of its strong infrared emission and
constrained it to a relatively compact emitting region of <2kpc. It is in this
obscured region where most of the current star formation activity is taking
place as expected for LIRGs. We have used Herschel imaging data for the first
time to constrain the cold dust emission with unprecedented accuracy. We have
fitted the integrated far-IR spectral energy distribution and derived the
properties of the dust, obtaining a dust mass of 3x10^7Msun. The far-IR is
dominated by emission at 35K, consistent with dust heated by the on-going star
formation activity.

area of the hippocampus. The proposed neuronal circuit includes two fast- and
two slowly-spiking cells which are interconnected by means of dynamical
synapses. On the individual level, each neuron is modeled by FitzHugh-Nagumo
equations. Three basic rhythmic patterns are observed: gamma-rhythm in which
the fast neurons are uniformly spiking, theta-rhythm in which the individual
spikes are separated by quiet epochs, and theta/gamma rhythm with repeated
patches of spikes. We analyze the influence of asymmetry of synaptic strengths
on the synchronization in the network and demonstrate that strong asymmetry
reduces the variety of available dynamical states. The model network exhibits
multistability; this results in occurrence of hysteresis in dependence on the
conductances of individual connections. We show that switching between
different rhythmic patterns in the network depends on the degree of
synchronization between the slow cells.

physics that makes the inflaton lighter than the Hubble scale during inflation
often also makes other scalars this light. These scalars can acquire
isocurvature fluctuations during inflation, and given that their VEVs determine
the mass spectrum and the coupling constants of the effective low-energy field
theory, these fluctuations give rise to couplings and masses that are modulated
from one Hubble patch to another. These seem just what is required to obtain
primordial adiabatic fluctuations through conversion into density perturbations
through the `modulation mechanism', wherein reheating takes place with
different efficiency in different regions of our Universe. Fluctuations
generated in this way can generically produce non-gaussianity larger than
obtained in single-field slow-roll inflation; potentially observable in the
near future. We provide here the first explicit example of the modulation
mechanism at work in string cosmology, within the framework of LARGE Volume
Type-IIB string flux compactifications. The inflationary dynamics involves two
light Kaehler moduli: a fibre divisor plays the role of the inflaton whose
decay rate to visible sector degrees of freedom is modulated by the primordial
fluctuations of a blow-up mode (which is made light by the use of
poly-instanton corrections). We find the challenges of embedding the mechanism
into a concrete UV completion constrains the properties of the non-gaussianity
that is found, since for generic values of the underlying parameters, the model
predicts a local bi-spectrum with fNL of order `a few'. However, a moderate
tuning of the parameters gives also rise to explicit examples with fNL O(20)

characteristics from the operator-product expansion (OPE) for field-theory
correlators, which constitutes the basis of the method of QCD sum rules. This
progress is mainly related to a deeper understanding of one of the key
ingredients of the method of sum rules -- the effective continuum threshold.
The latter determines to a great extent the numerical values of the bound-state
parameters obtained by sum rules. The understanding of properties of the
effective continuum threshold allows one to formulate a new algorithm for fixng
this quantity for various correlators and in this way gain control over the
systematic uncertainties of the bound-state parameters extracted from sum
rules. We start with examples from quantum mechanics, where bound-state
properties may be calculated independently in two ways: exactly, by solving the
Schr\""odinger equation, and approximately, by the method of dispersive sum
rules. Knowing the exact solution is crucial as it allows us to control each
step of the sum-rule extraction procedure. On the basis of this analysis, we
formulate several improvements of the standard procedures adopted in the method
of sum rules in QCD. We then show the impact of these modifications on the
extraction of the decay constants of heavy mesons.

between free space and thin films is of crucial importance for new technologies
in energy efficiency. Nanostructured materials have opened unprecedented
opportunities for light management, notably in thin-film solar cells. Efficient
coherent light trapping has been accomplished through the careful design of
plasmonic nanoparticles and gratings, resonant dielectric particles and
photonic crystals. Alternative approaches have used randomly-textured surfaces
as strong light diffusers to benefit from their broadband and wide-angle
properties. Here, we propose a new strategy for photon management in thin films
that combines both advantages of an efficient trapping due to coherent optical
effects and broadband/wide-angle properties due to disorder. Our approach
consists in the excitation of electromagnetic modes formed by multiple light
scattering and wave interference in two-dimensional random media. We show, by
numerical calculations, that the spectral and angular responses of thin films
containing disordered photonic patterns are intimately related to the in-plane
light transport process and can be tuned through structural correlations. Our
findings, which are applicable to all waves, are particularly suited for
improving the absorption efficiency of thin-film solar cells and can provide a
novel approach for high-extraction efficiency light-emitting diodes.

statistical inference is a challenging issue that calls for pragmatic
approaches that take advantage of both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The
elegance of Bayesian methodology is founded in the propagation of information
content provided by experimental data and prior assumptions to the posterior
probability distribution of model predictions. However, for complex
applications experimental data and prior assumptions potentially constrain the
posterior probability distribution insufficiently. In these situations Bayesian
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can be infeasible. From a frequentist point
of view insufficient experimental data and prior assumptions can be interpreted
as non-identifiability. The profile likelihood approach offers to detect and to
resolve non-identifiability by experimental design iteratively. Therefore, it
allows one to better constrain the posterior probability distribution until
Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can be used securely. Using an application
from cell biology we compare both methods and show that a successive
application of both methods facilitates a realistic assessment of uncertainty
in model predictions.

inertia forces in fluid dynamics with the inertia forces in electromagnetism
that are known to induce resistance forces on masses both due to acceleration
and at constant velocity. It is shown that the force exerted on a particle by
an ideal fluid produces two effects: i) resistance to acceleration and, ii) an
increase of mass with velocity. These resistance forces arise due to the fluid
dragged by the particle, where the bare mass of the particle at rest changes
when in motion (""dressed"" particle). It is demonstrated that the vector
potential created by a charged particle in motion acts as an ideal space flow
that surrounds the particle. The interaction between the particle and the
entrained space flow gives rise to the observed properties of inertia and the
relativistic increase of mass. Parallels are made between the inertia property
of matter, electromagnetism and the hydrodynamic drag in potential flow.
Accordingly, in this framework the non resistance of a particle in uniform
motion through an ideal fluid (D'Alembert's paradox) corresponds to Newton's
first law. The law of inertia suggests that the physical vacuum can be modeled
as an ideal fluid, agreeing with the space-time ideal fluid approach from
general relativity.

type is not defined only on the basis of the peak frequency of the synchrotron
component in their Spectral Energy Distribution (types L and H), but also on
the relevance of this component with respect to the brightness of the host
galaxy (types N and G, for nuclear or galaxy dominated sources). We found that
the SDSS colour index u-r=1.4 is a good separator between these two types. We
used multiband colour-colour plots to study the properties of the BL Lac
classes and found that in the X-ray to radio flux ratio vs u-r plot most of the
N (blue) sources are located in a rather narrow strip, while the G-sources
(red) are spread in a large area, and most of them are located in galaxy
clusters or interacting systems, suggesting that their X-ray emission is not
from a genuine BL Lac nucleus but it is related to their environment. Of the
about 135 sources detected in the gamma-rays by Fermi-GST, nearly all belong to
the N-type, indicating that only this type of sources should be considered as
genuine BL Lac nuclei. The J-H, H-K plot of sources detected in the 2MASS
catalogue is consistent with that of the ""bona fide"" BL Lac objects,
independently of their N or G classification from the optical indices,
indicating the existence in G-type sources of a K-band excess possibly due to a
steep, low frequency peaked emission which deserves further investigations. We
propose to use these colour plots as a further tool for searching candidate
counterparts of newly discovered high-energy sources.

coupled to a large number of fermionic degrees of freedom. As the number of
flavors is varied the gauge theory may be confining, walking or conformal. The
toy model mimicking this feature is the two dimensional O(3) sigma model with a
theta-term. For all theta the model is asymptotically free. For small theta the
model is confining in the infra red, for theta = pi the model has a non-trivial
infra red fixed point and consequently for theta slightly below pi the coupling
walks. The first step in investigating the notoriously difficult systematic
effects of the gauge theory in the toy model is to establish non-perturbatively
that the theta parameter is actually a relevant coupling. This is done by
showing that there exist quantities that are entirely given by the total
topological charge and are well defined in the continuum limit and are
non-zero, despite the fact that the topological susceptibility is divergent.
More precisely it is established that the differences of connected correlation
functions of the topological charge (the cumulants) are finite and non-zero and
consequently there is only a single divergent parameter in Z(theta) but
otherwise it is finite. This divergent constant can be removed by an
appropriate counter term rendering the theory completely finite even at theta >
0.

approximations (upstream ions, upstream neutral particles, leakage neutral

structure due to leakage neutral particles. It is shown that the upstream flow
is decelerated in the precursor region and the shock compression ratio becomes
smaller than without leakage neutral particles, but the total compression ratio
does not change. Even if leakage of neutral particles is small (a few percents
of total upstream particles), this smaller compression ratio of the shock can
explain steep gamma-ray spectra from young supernova remnants. Furthermore,

exchange constant is obtained for vectors which identifies the local
orientation of the spin of the itinerant electrons. The amplitude of the spin
vectors is an effective spin of the itinerant electrons accounting for the fact
that some sites, in the ground state, are doubly occupied or empty. Accounting
adequately for the magnon-magnon interaction the N\'{e}el temperature is
calculated. When the ratio $\frac tU$ is small enough ($\frac tU\leq 0.09$) the
effective model describes a system of localized electrons. Increasing the ratio
increases the density of doubly occupied states which in turn decreases the
effective spin and N\'{e}el temperature. The phase diagram in plane of

critical point ($T_N=0$) is reached at $\frac tU=0.9$. The magnons in the

spin physics in the condensed matter. The dynamics of this system and its
coupling to electron spins is fundamentally different from its bulk
counter-part as well as that of atoms due to increased fluctuations that result
from reduced dimensions. In recent years, the interest in studying quantum dot
nuclear spin systems and their coupling to confined electron spins has been
fueled by its direct implication for possible applications of such systems in
quantum information processing as well as by the fascinating nonlinear
(quantum-)dynamics of the coupled electron-nuclear spin system. In this

studying this mesoscopic,coupled electron-nuclear spin system and discuss how

read-out quantum dot nuclei. We discuss how such techniques have been applied
in quantum dots to efficiently establish a non-zero mean nuclear spin
polarization and, most recently, were used to reduce fluctuations of the
average quantum dot nuclear spin orientation. Both results in turn have
important implications for the preservation of electron spin coherence in
quantum dots, which we discuss. We conclude by speculating how this recently

enable experimental observation of quantum-mechanical signatures or possible
collective behavior of mesoscopic nuclear spin ensembles.

phenomenological dynamical law of evolution unraveled in the classical limit
from a timeless formulation in terms of probability amplitudes conditioned by
the values of suitably chosen internal clock variables, thereby unifying the
conditional probability interpretation (CPI) and the semiclassical approach for
the problem of time in quantum theory. Our formalism stems from an exact
factorization of the Hamiltonian eigenfunction of the clock plus system
composite, where the clock and system factors play the role of marginal and
conditional probability amplitudes, respectively. Application of the Variation
Principle leads to a pair of exact coupled pseudoeigenvalue equations for these
amplitudes, whose solution requires an iterative self-consistent procedure. The
equation for the conditional amplitude constitutes an effective ""equation of
motion"" for the quantum state of the system with respect to the clock
variables. These coupled equations also provide a convenient framework for
treating the back-reaction of the system on the clock at various levels of
approximation. At the lowest level, when the WKB approximation for the marginal
amplitude is appropriate, in the classical limit of the clock variables the
TDSE for the system emerges as a matter of course from the conditional
equation. In this connection, we provide a discussion of the characteristics
required by physical systems to serve as good clocks. This development is seen
to be advantageous over the original CPI and semiclassical approach since it
maintains the essence of the conventional formalism of quantum mechanics,
admits a transparent interpretation, avoids the use of the Born-Oppenheimer
approximation, and resolves various objections raised about them.

done either with the excision method, in which the black hole interior is
excised from the numerical grid, or with the puncture method, in which the
singular part of the conformal factor is expressed in terms of an analytical
background solution, and the Hamiltonian constraint is then solved for a
correction to the background solution that, usually, is assumed to be regular
everywhere. We discuss an alternative approach in which the Hamiltonian
constraint is solved for an inverse power of the conformal factor. This new
function remains finite everywhere, so that this approach requires neither
excision nor a split into background and correction. In particular, this method
can be used without modification even when the correction to the conformal
factor is singular itself. We demonstrate this feature for rotating black holes

distributed among the site and the right neighbour, whereas in the symmetric
version the redistribution occurs among the two neighbours. The steady state
mass distribution of the model is obtained using a perturbation method for both
parallel and random sequential updates. In most cases, this perturbation theory
provides a steady state distribution with reasonable accuracy.

several such composite pulses robust against standard experimental defects in
NRM: static or radio-frequency field miscalibration, fields inhomogeneities.
Numerical simulations show that the magic sandwich pulse sequence, a pulse
sequence that reverse the average dipolar field while applied, is plagued by
defects originating from its short initial and final \pi/2 radio-frequency

transmission delays even when packet sizes are light-tailed. Moreover, the
impact of heavy-tailed delays persists even when packets size are upper
bounded. The key question we study in this paper is how the use of coding
techniques to transmit information, together with different system
configurations, would affect the distribution of delay. To investigate this
problem, we model the underlying channel as a Markov modulated binary erasure
channel, where transmitted bits are either received successfully or erased.
Erasure codes are used to encode information prior to transmission, which
ensures that a fixed fraction of the bits in the codeword can lead to
successful decoding. We use incremental redundancy codes, where the codeword is
divided into codeword trunks and these trunks are transmitted one at a time to
provide incremental redundancies to the receiver until the information is
recovered. We characterize the distribution of delay under two different
scenarios: (I) Decoder uses memory to cache all previously successfully
received bits. (II) Decoder does not use memory, where received bits are
discarded if the corresponding information cannot be decoded. In both cases, we
consider codeword length with infinite and finite support. From a theoretical
perspective, our results provide a benchmark to quantify the tradeoff between
system complexity and the distribution of delay.

several basic parameters, the complexity status of the 3-coloring problem on
graphs with small diameter, i.e. with diameter 2 or 3, has been a longstanding
and challenging open question. For graphs with diameter 2 we provide the first
subexponential algorithm with complexity $2^{O(\sqrt{n\log n})}$, which is
asymptotically the same as the currently best known time complexity for the
graph isomorphism (GI) problem. Moreover, we prove that the graph isomorphism
problem on 3-colorable graphs with diameter 2 is GI-complete. Furthermore we
present a subclass of graphs with diameter 2 that admits a polynomial algorithm
for 3-coloring. For graphs with diameter 3 we establish the complexity of
3-coloring by proving that for every $\varepsilon \in [0,1)$, 3-coloring is
NP-complete on triangle-free graphs of diameter 3 and radius 2 with $n$
vertices and minimum degree $\delta=\Theta(n^{\varepsilon})$. Moreover,
assuming ETH, we provide three different amplifications of our hardness results
to obtain for every $\varepsilon \in [0,1)$ subexponential lower bounds for the
complexity of 3-coloring on triangle-free graphs with diameter 3 and minimum
degree $\delta=\Theta(n^{\varepsilon})$. Finally, we provide a 3-coloring
algorithm with running time
$2^{O(\min\{\delta\Delta,\frac{n}{\delta}\log\delta\})}$ for graphs with
diameter 3, where $\delta$ (resp. $\Delta $) is the minimum (resp. maximum)
degree of the input graph. To the best of our knowledge, this algorithm is the
first subexponential algorithm for graphs with $\delta=\omega(1)$ and for
graphs with $\delta=O(1)$ and $\Delta=o(n)$. Due to the above lower bounds of
the complexity of 3-coloring, the running time of this algorithm is
asymptotically almost tight when the minimum degree if the input graph is
$\delta=\Theta(n^{\varepsilon})$, where $\varepsilon \in [1/2,1)$.

self-excited dynamo action in their convective interiors. Observations reveal a
variety of field topologies ranging from large-scale, axial dipole to more
structured magnetic fields. In this article, we investigate more than 70
three-dimensional, self-consistent dynamo models obtained by direct numerical
simulations. The control parameters, the aspect ratio and the mechanical
boundary conditions have been varied to build up this sample of models. Both,
strongly dipolar and multipolar models have been obtained. We show that these
dynamo regimes can in general be distinguished by the ratio of a typical
convective length scale to the Rossby radius. Models with a predominantly
dipolar magnetic field were obtained, if the convective length scale is at
least an order of magnitude larger than the Rossby radius. Moreover, we
highlight the role of the strong shear associated with the geostrophic zonal
flow for models with stress-free boundary conditions. In this case, the above
transition disappears and is replaced by a region of bistability for which
dipolar and multipolar dynamos co-exist. We interpret our results in terms of
dynamo eigenmodes using the so-called test-field method. We can thus show that
models in the dipolar regime are characterized by an isolated 'single mode'.
Competing overtones become significant as the boundary to multipolar dynamos is
approached. We discuss how these findings relate to previous models and to
observations.

can be divided into three groups: big photospheric radius expansion (PRE)
bursts are about ten times more luminous than medium bursts, while the latter
are about ten times more luminous than small bursts. The PCA field-of-view of
these observations contains several known bursters, and hence some of the
observed bursts might not be from IGR J17498-2921. The oscillations during big

luminosity differences among various bursts are primarily due to differences in
normalizations, and not temperatures, even when we consider the effects of

those small and medium bursts, which originated from IGR J17498-2921. The low

suggest a small angle between the spin axis and the magnetic axis. We find

  galaxies since z ~ 1","Astronomy and Astrophysics, in press. 18 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables","A&A 548, A7 (2012)","10.1051/0004-6361/201219085",,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  In this paper we measure the merger fraction and rate, both minor and major,
of massive early-type galaxies (M_star >= 10^11 M_Sun) in the COSMOS field, and
study their role in mass and size evolution. We use the 30-band photometric
catalogue in COSMOS, complemented with the spectroscopy of the zCOSMOS survey,
to define close pairs with a separation 10h^-1 kpc <= r_p <= 30h-1 kpc and a
relative velocity Delta v <= 500 km s^-1. We measure both major (stellar mass
ratio mu = M_star,2/M_star,1 >= 1/4) and minor (1/10 <= mu < 1/4) merger
fractions of massive galaxies, and study their dependence on redshift and on
morphology. The merger fraction and rate of massive galaxies evolves as a
power-law (1+z)^n, with major mergers increasing with redshift, n_MM = 1.4, and
minor mergers showing little evolution, n_mm ~ 0. When split by their
morphology, the minor merger fraction for early types is higher by a factor of
three than that for spirals, and both are nearly constant with redshift. Our
results show that massive early-type galaxies have undergone 0.89 mergers (0.43
major and 0.46 minor) since z ~ 1, leading to a mass growth of ~30%. We find
that mu >= 1/10 mergers can explain ~55% of the observed size evolution of
these galaxies since z ~ 1. Another ~20% is due to the progenitor bias (younger
galaxies are more extended) and we estimate that very minor mergers (mu < 1/10)
could contribute with an extra ~20%. The remaining ~5% should come from other
processes (e.g., adiabatic expansion or observational effects). This picture
also reproduces the mass growth and velocity dispersion evolution of these
galaxies. We conclude from these results that merging is the main contributor
to the size evolution of massive ETGs at z <= 1, accounting for ~50-75% of that
evolution in the last 8 Gyr. Nearly half of the evolution due to mergers is
related to minor (mu < 1/4) events.

candidate supernova remnant (SNR) in the ROSAT All Sky Survey and the MOST
supernova remnant catalogue, in order to identify it as a SNR.
  Methods: The SNR candidate and its central sources were studied using
observations from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, SWIFT, the Australian
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 1.4 and 2.5 GHz and WISE infrared observation
at 24 $\mu$m.
  Results: We conclude that G308.4-1.4 is indeed a supernova remnant by means
of its morphology matching at X-ray, radio and infrared wavelength, its
spectral energy distribution in the X-ray band and its emission characteristics
in the radio band. G308.4-1.4 is a shell-type SNR. X-ray, radio and infrared
emission is seen only in the eastern part of the remnant. The X-ray emission
can best be described by an absorbed non-equilibrium collisional plasma with a
hydrogen density of $n_\mathrm{H}=(1.02\pm 0.04) \times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, a
plasma temperature of $6.3^{+1.2}_{-0.7}$ million Kelvin and an under-abundance
of Iron, Neon and Magnesium, as well as an overabundance in Sulfur with respect
to the solar values. The SNR has a spectral index in the radio band of
$\alpha=-0.7\pm0.2$. A detailed analysis revealed that the remnant is at a
distance of 6 to 12 kpc and the progenitor star exploded $\sim 5000$ to 7500
years ago. Two faint X-ray point sources located near to the remnant's
geometrical center are detected. Both sources have no counterpart at other
wavelengths, leaving them as candidates for the compact remnant of the
supernova explosion.

Circulation Model (NEMO-PISCES). In the model, aluminium enters the ocean by
means of dust deposition. The internal oceanic processes are described by
advection, mixing and reversible scavenging. The model has been evaluated
against a number of selected high-quality datasets covering much of the world
ocean, especially those from the West Atlantic Geotraces cruises of 2010 and
2011. Generally, the model results are in fair agreement with the observations.
However, the model does not describe well the vertical distribution of
dissolved Al in the North Atlantic Ocean. The model may require changes in the
physical forcing and the vertical dependence of the sinking velocity of
biogenic silica to account for other discrepancies. To explore the model
behaviour, sensitivity experiments have been performed, in which we changed the
key parameters of the scavenging process as well as the input of aluminium into
the ocean. This resulted in a better understanding of aluminium in the ocean,
and it is now clear which parameter has what effect on the dissolved aluminium
distribution and which processes might be missing in the model, among which
boundary scavenging and biological incorporation of aluminium into diatoms.

evidenced by the diffuse TeV emission detected from the inner $\sim$$2^\circ$
of the Galaxy. Although it is not yet entirely clear whether the origin of the
TeV photons is due to hadronic or leptonic interactions, the tight correlation
of the intensity distribution with the distribution of molecular gas along the
Galactic ridge strongly points to a pionic-decay process involving relativistic
protons. In earlier work, we concluded that point-source candidates, such as
the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A* (identified with the HESS source
J1745-290), or the pulsar wind nebulae dispersed along the Galactic plane,
could not account for the observed diffuse TeV emission from this region.
Motivated by this result, we consider here the feasibility that the cosmic rays
populating the Galactic Center (GC) region are accelerated in situ by magnetic
turbulence. Our results indicate that even in a highly conductive environment,
this mechanism is efficient enough to energize protons within the intercloud
medium to the $\ga $ TeV energies required to produce the HESS emission.

axisymmetric obscuring medium, which is commonly depicted as a torus of gas and
dust surrounding the central engine. However, a robust, dynamical model of the
torus is required in order to understand the fundamental physics of AGNs and
interpret their observational signatures. Here we explore self-similar, dusty
disk-winds, driven by both magnetocentrifugal forces and radiation pressure, as
an explanation for the torus. Using these models, we make predictions of AGN
infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 2-100 microns by
varying parameters such as: the viewing angle; the base column density of the
wind; the Eddington ratio; the black hole mass; and the amount of power in the
input spectrum emitted in the X-ray relative to that emitted in the UV/optical.
We find that models with N_H,0 = 10^25 cm^-2, L/L_Edd = 0.1, and M_BH >= 10^8
Msun are able to adequately approximate the general shape and amount of power
expected in the IR as observed in a composite of optically luminous Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars. The effect of varying the relative power
coming out in X-rays relative to the UV is a change in the emission below ~5
micron from the hottest dust grains; this arises from the differing
contributions to heating and acceleration of UV and X-ray photons. We see mass
outflows ranging from ~1-4 Msun/yr, terminal velocities ranging from ~1900-8000
km/s, and kinetic luminosities ranging from ~1x10^42-8x10^43 erg/s. Further
development of this model holds promise for using specific features of observed
IR spectra in AGNs to infer fundamental physical parameters of the systems.
