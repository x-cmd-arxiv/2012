materials under load using a fiber bundle model connected to an elastic half
space. We find that the breakdown process follows the equal load sharing fiber
bundle model without any detectable spatial correlations between the positions
of the failing fibers until localization sets in. The onset of localization is
an instability, not a phase transition. Depending on the elastic constant
describing the elastic half space, localization sets in before or after the
critical load causing the interface to fail completely, is reached. There is a
crossover between failure due to localization or failure without spatial
correlations when tuning the elastic constant, not a phase transition. Contrary
to earlier claims based on models different from ours, we find that a finite
fraction of fibers must fail before the critical load is attained, even in the
extreme localization regime, i.e.\ for very small elastic constant. We
furthermore find that the critical load remains finite for all values of the
elastic constant in the limit of an infinitely large system.

social networks, given only simple information about the target and using only
local knowledge about the topology. Sociologists conjecture that people find
routes greedily by passing the message to an acquaintance that has more in
common with the target than themselves, e.g. if a dentist in Saarbr\""ucken
wants to send a message to a specific lawyer in Munich, he may forward it to
someone who is a lawyer and/or lives in Munich. Modelling this setting,
Eppstein et al. introduced the notion of category-based routing. The goal is to
assign a set of categories to each node of a graph such that greedy routing is
possible. By proving bounds on the number of categories a node has to be in we
can argue about the plausibility of the underlying sociological model. In this
paper we substantially improve the upper bounds introduced by Eppstein et al.

requiring spherical horizons. The canonical approach for LQG favours a

argue that if the DD relation does not hold the X-ray plus SZE technique
furnishes a $H^{*}_{0}=H_{0}/\eta^{2}$. We use 25 ADD of galaxy clusters to
obtain simultaneous constraints on $H_{0}$ and possible violation of the DD
relation in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. Such a violation is parametrized by two
functions: $\eta(z) = 1 + \eta_{0}z$ and $\eta(z) = 1 + \eta_{0}z/(1+z)$, where
$\eta_0$ is a constant parameter quantifying possible departures from the
strict validity. Finally, by marginalizing on the $\eta_{0}$ in both
parameterizations, we obtain constraints on $H_0$ regardless of the validity of
the DD relation. For the linear and non linear $\eta(z)$ functions, we obtain
$H_{0}= 75^{+ 7}_{-7}$ km/s/Mpc and $H_{0}= 75^{+ 10}_{-7}$ km/s/Mpc,

the interaction between the coefficient $\beta$ of the cubic GL term and the de
Gennes distance $\Lambda$ and its influence on the temperature $T$ of the
strip. Very substantial role is played also by the carrier density $n_s$ that
naturally emerges as an integration constant of the GL equation. Physical
interpretation of the obtained results is based on the $n_s$-dependent
effective potential $V_{eff}({\bf r})$ created by the nonlinear term and its
influence on the lowest eigenvalue of the corresponding Schr\""{o}dinger
equation. In particular, for the large cubicities, the temperature $T$ becomes
$\Lambda$ independent linearly decreasing function of the growing $\beta$ since
in this limit the boundary conditions can not alter very strong $V_{eff}$. It
is shown that the temperature increase, which is produced in the linear GL
regime by the negative de Gennes distance, is wiped out by the growing
cubicity. In this case, the decreasing $T$ passes through its bulk value $T_c$
at the unique density $n_s^{(0)}$ only, and the corresponding extrapolation
length $\Lambda_{T=T_c}$ is an analytical function of $\beta$ whose properties
are discussed in detail. For the densities smaller than $n_s^{(0)}$, the
temperature stays above $T_c$ saturating for the large cubicities to the value
determined by $n_s$ and negative $\Lambda$ while for $n_s>n_s^{(0)}$ the
superconductivity is destroyed by the growing GL nonlinearity at some
temperature $T>T_c$, which depends on $\Lambda$, $n_s$ and $\beta$. It is
proved that the concentration $n_s^{(0)}$ transforms for the large cubicities

more bright sources and fewer faint sources per unit stellar mass. The XLF of

(discrete or continuous) dynamical systems, the interactions are usually
assumed to be instantaneous: the rates of change of the actual states of the
actors at given instant of time are assumed to depend on their states at the
same time. In reality the natural time delay should be included in the
corresponding models. We investigate a general class of linear models of dyadic
interactions with a constant discrete time delay. We prove that in such models
the changes of stability of the stationary points from instability to stability
or vice versa occur for various intervals of the parameters which determine the
intensity of interactions. The conditions guaranteeing arbitrary number (zero,
one ore more) of switches are formulated and the relevant theorems are proved.
A systematic analysis of all generic cases is carried out. It is obvious that
the dynamics of interactions depend both on the strength of reactions of
partners on their own states as well as on the partner's state. Results
presented in this paper suggest that the joint strength of the reactions of
partners to the partner's state, reflected by the product of the strength of
reactions of both partners, has greater impact on the dynamics of relationships
than the joint strength of reactions to their own states. The dynamics is
typically much simpler when the joint strength of reactions to the partner's
state is stronger than for their own states. Moreover, we have found that
multiple stability switches are possible only in the case of such relationships
in which one of the partners reacts with delay on their own state. Some
generalizations to triadic interactions are also presented.

Saturn formed they scattered a significant number of remnant planetesimals into
highly eccentric orbits. In this paper, we show that if there had been a
massive, extended protoplanetary disk at that time, then the disk would have
excited Kozai oscillations in some of the scattered objects, driving them into
high-inclination (i > 50 deg), low-eccentricity orbits (q > 30 AU). The
dissipation of the gaseous disk would strand a subset of objects in these
high-inclination orbits; orbits that are stable on Gyr time scales. To date,
surveys have not detected any Kuiper Belt Objects with orbits consistent with
this dynamical mechanism. Using these non-detections by the Deep Ecliptic
Survey (DES) and the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey we are able to rule
out an extended gaseous protoplanetary disk (R_D > 80 AU) in our solar system

Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will all us to further constrain the

the particle weights in an N-body system until the target observables are well
matched. Here we introduce a moving prior regularization (MPR) method for such
particle models. It is based on determining from the particles a distribution
of priors in phase-space, which are updated in parallel with the weight
adaptation. This method allows one to construct smooth models from noisy data
without erasing global phase-space gradients. We first apply MPR to a spherical
system for which the distribution function can in theory be uniquely recovered
from idealized data. We show that NMAGIC with MPR indeed converges to the true
solution with very good accuracy, independent of the initial particle model.
Compared to the standard weight entropy regularization, biases in the
anisotropy structure are removed and local fluctuations in the intrinsic
distribution function are reduced. We then investigate how the uncertainties in
the inferred dynamical structure increase with less complete and noisier
kinematic data, and how the dependence on the initial particle model also
increases. Finally, we apply the MPR technique to the two
intermediate-luminosity elliptical galaxies NGC 4697 and NGC 3379, obtaining

mechanisms are thought to contribute to the ejection of runaway stars, both
involve binarity (or higher multiplicity). In the binary supernova scenario a
runaway star receives its velocity when its binary massive companion explodes
as a supernova (SN). In the alternative dynamical ejection scenario, runaway
stars are formed through gravitational interactions between stars and binaries
in dense, compact clusters or cluster cores. Here we study the ejection
scenario. We make use of extensive N-body simulations of massive clusters, as
well as analytic arguments, in order to to characterize the expected ejection
velocity distribution of runaways stars. We find the ejection velocity
distribution of the fastest runaways (>~80 km s^-1) depends on the binary
distribution in the cluster, consistent with our analytic toy model, whereas
the distribution of lower velocity runaways appears independent of the binaries
properties. For a realistic log constant distribution of binary separations, we
find the velocity distribution to follow a simple power law; Gamma(v) goes like
v^(-8/3) for the high velocity runaways and v^(-3/2) for the low velocity ones.
We calculate the total expected ejection rates of runaway stars from our
simulated massive clusters and explore their mass function and their binarity.
The mass function of runaway stars is biased towards high masses, and depends
strongly on their velocity. The binarity of runaways is a decreasing function
of their ejection velocity, with no binaries expected to be ejected with v>150
km s^-1. We also find that hyper-runaways with velocities of hundreds of km
s^-1 can be dynamically ejected from stellar clusters, but only at very low
rates, which cannot account for a significant fraction of the observed
population of hyper-velocity stars in the Galactic halo.

At $z=3$ the dominant progenitor halos were populated with spherical model
galaxies with and without accounting for adiabatic contraction. We apply a
weighting scheme which allows us to change the relative amount of dark and
stellar material assigned to each simulation particle in order to produce
luminous properties which agree better with abundance matching arguments and
observed bulge sizes at $z=3$. This permits the study of the effect of initial
compactness on the evolution of the mass-size relation. We find that for more
compact initial stellar distributions the size of the final Brightest Cluster
Galaxy grows with mass according to $r\propto M^{2}$, whereas for more extended
initial distributions, $r\propto M$. Our results show that collisionless
mergers in a cosmological context can reduce the strength of inner dark matter
cusps with changes in logarithmic slope of 0.3 to 0.5 at fixed radius. Shallow
cusps such as those found recently in several strong lensing clusters thus do
not necessarily conflict with CDM, but may rather reflect on the initial

and ring regions of the ring galaxy NGC 1291. We detect 169 X-ray point sources
in the galaxy, 75 in the bulge and 71 in the ring, utilizing the four available
Chandra observations totaling an effective exposure of 179 ks. We report
photometric properties of these sources in a point-source catalog. There are
~40% of the bulge sources and ~25% of the ring sources showing >3\sigma
long-term variability in their X-ray count rate. The X-ray colors suggest that
a significant fraction of the bulge (~75%) and ring (~65%) sources are likely
low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). The spectra of the nuclear source indicate
that it is a low-luminosity AGN with moderate obscuration; spectral variability
is observed between individual observations. We construct 0.3-8.0 keV X-ray
luminosity functions (XLFs) for the bulge and ring XRB populations, taking into
account the detection incompleteness and background AGN contamination. We reach
90% completeness limits of ~1.5\times10^{37} and ~2.2\times10^{37} erg/s for
the bulge and ring populations, respectively. Both XLFs can be fit with a
broken power-law model, and the shapes are consistent with those expected for
populations dominated by LMXBs. We perform detailed population synthesis
modeling of the XRB populations in NGC 1291, which suggests that the observed
combined XLF is dominated by an old LMXB population. We compare the bulge and
ring XRB populations, and argue that the ring XRBs are associated with a
younger stellar population than the bulge sources, based on the relative
overdensity of X-ray sources in the ring, the generally harder X-ray color of
the ring sources, the overabundance of luminous sources in the combined XLF,
and the flatter shape of the ring XLF.

around their host stars. Theoretical studies encounter difficulties in
explaining their formation and origin. Here we propose a novel scenario for the
production of planetary systems at such orbits, through the dynamical recapture
of free floating planets (FFPs) in dispersing stellar clusters. This process is
a natural extension of the recently suggested scenario for the formation of
wide stellar binaries. We use N-body simulations of dispersing clusters with
10-1000 stars and comparable numbers of FFPs to study this process. We find
that planets are captured into wide orbits in the typical range ~100-10^6 AU,
and have a wide range of eccentricities (thermal distribution). Typically, 3-6
x (f_FFP/1) % of all stars capture a planetary companion with such properties
(where f_FFP is the number of FFP per star). The planetary capture efficiency
is comparable to that of capture-formed stellar-binaries, and shows a similar
dependence on the cluster size and structure. It is almost independent of the
specific planetary mass; planets as well as sub-stellar companions of any mass
can be captured. The capture efficiency decreases with increasing cluster size,
and for a given cluster size the it increases with the host/primary mass. More
than one planet can be captured around the same host and planets can be
captured into binary systems. Planets can also be captured into pre-existing
planetary and into orbits around black holes and massive white dwarfs, if these
formed early enough before the cluster dispersal. In particular, stellar black
holes have a high capture efficiency (>50 % and 5-10 x (f_FFP/1) % for capture
of stars and planetary companions, respectively) due to their large mass.
Finally, although rare, two FFPs or brown dwarfs can become bound and form a
FFP-binary system with no stellar host.

coupled to a set of three non-Abelian gauge fields. Our model's novel
requirement is that the gauge fields begin inflation with a rotationally
invariant vacuum expectation value (VEV) that is preserved through
identification of SU(2) gauge invariance with rotations in three dimensions.
The gauge VEV interacts with the background value of the axion, leading to an
attractor solution that exhibits slow roll inflation even when the axion decay
constant has a natural value ($<M_{\rm Pl}$). Assuming a sinusoidal potential
for the axion, we find that inflation continues until the axionic potential
vanishes. The speed at which the axion moves along its potential is modulated
by its interactions with the gauge VEV, rather than being determined by the
slope of its bare potential. For sub-Plankian axion decay constants vanishingly
small tensor to scalar ratios are predicted, a direct consequence of the Lyth
bound. The parameter that controls the interaction strength between the axion
and the gauge fields requires a technically natural tuning of
$\mathcal{O}$(100).

particular, we investigate hypotheses such as whether Groupon subscribers are
more critical than their peers, or whether some fraction of Groupon merchants
provide significantly worse service to customers using Groupons. We suggest an
additional novel hypothesis: reviews from Groupon subscribers are lower on
average because such reviews correspond to real, unbiased customers, while the
body of reviews on Yelp contain some fraction of reviews from biased or even

potentials and point charges, to sources represented by charged extended
objects (branes). The simplest example of such a CS-brane coupling is a domain
wall coupled to the electromagnetic CS three-form. This describes a
topologically charged interface where the CS form AdA is supported, separating
two three-dimensional spatial regions in 3+1 spacetime. Electrodynamics at
either side of the brane is described by the same Maxwell's equations, but
those two regions have different vacua, characterized by a different value of
the \theta-parameter multiplying the Pontryagin form F ^ F. The \theta-term is
the abelian version of the concept introduced by 't Hooft for the resolution of
the U(1) problem in QCD. We point out that CS-generalized classical
electrodynamics shows new phenomena when two neighboring regions with different
\theta-vacua are present. These topological effects result from surface effects
induced by the boundary and we explore the consequences of such boundary
effects for the propagation of the electromagnetic field in Maxwell theory.
Several features, including optical and electrostatic/magnetostatic responses,

reflection rule is replaced with a Markov transition probabilities operator P
that, at each collision of the billiard particle with the boundary of the
billiard domain, gives the probability distribution of the post-collision
velocity for a given pre-collision velocity. A random billiard with
microstructure (RBM) is a random billiard for which P is derived from a choice
of geometric/mechanical structure on the boundary of the billiard domain. RBMs
provide simple and explicit mechanical models of particle-surface interaction
that can incorporate thermal effects and permit a detailed study of
thermostatic action from the perspective of the standard theory of Markov
chains on general state spaces.
  We focus on the operator P itself and how it relates to the
mechanical/geometric features of the microstructure, such as mass ratios,
curvatures, and potentials. The main results are as follows: (1) we
characterize the stationary probabilities (equilibrium states) of P and show
how standard equilibrium distributions studied in classical statistical
mechanics, such as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and the Knudsen cosine
law, arise naturally as generalized invariant billiard measures; (2) we obtain
some basic functional theoretic properties of P. Under very general conditions,
we show that P is a self-adjoint operator of norm 1 on an appropriate Hilbert
space. In a simple but illustrative example, we show that P is a compact
(Hilbert-Schmidt) operator. This leads to the issue of relating the spectrum of
eigenvalues of P to the features of the microstructure;(3) we explore the
latter issue both analytically and numerically in a few representative
examples;(4) we present a general algorithm for simulating these Markov chains
based on a geometric description of the invariant volumes of classical
statistical mechanics.

decrease occurs through the change from Cr(III) to Cr(IV) as a result of the
charge compensation of the Ca doping. No changes are observed in the
antiferromagnetic transition temperature while strong changes are observed in
the transport measurements due to Ca content. The increase of the electrical
conductivity as well as the decrease of the activation energy are caused by the
formation of the small-polarons localized in the O-Cr-O lattice distortion. The
origin of small-polarons in the undoped sample is different in nature from the
calcium doped. ""Local non-centrosymetry"" is the source of the small-polaron
formation in undoped sample, while the change from Cr(III) to Cr(IV) through
the charge compensation of Ca(II) in the Y(III) site is the source of
small-polarons formations. The decrease of the average bond length Cr-O as well
as effective moments in the paramagnetic state and the increase of the

  Institute, Spring 2011",,,,"q-bio.PE math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phylogenetic mixture models, in which the sites in sequences undergo
different substitution processes along the same or different trees, allow the
description of heterogeneous evolutionary processes. As data sets consisting of
longer sequences become available, it is important to understand such models,
for both theoretical insights and use in statistical analyses. Some recent
articles have highlighted disturbing ""mimicking"" behavior in which a
distribution from a mixture model is identical to one arising on a different
tree or trees. Other works have indicated such problems are unlikely to occur
in practice, as they require very special parameter choices.
  After surveying some of these works on mixture models, we give several new
results. In general, if the number of components in a generating mixture is not
too large and we disallow zero or infinite branch lengths, then it cannot mimic
the behavior of a non-mixture on a different tree. On the other hand, if the
mixture model is locally over-parameterized, it is possible for a phylogenetic
mixture model to mimic distributions of another tree model. Though theoretical
questions remain, these sorts of results can serve as a guide to when the use
of mixture models in either ML or Bayesian frameworks is likely to lead to
statistically consistent inference, and when mimicking due to heterogeneity
should be considered a realistic possibility.

has been a mystery ever since the invention of quantum mechanics. In classical
physics, this entropy is believed to be the logarithm of the volume of phase
space accessible to an isolated system [1]. There is no quantum mechanical
analog to this. Instead, Von Neumann's hypothesis for the entropy [2] is most
widely used. However this gives zero for systems with a known wave function,
that is a pure state. This is because it measures the lack of information about
the system rather than the flow of heat as obtained from thermodynamic
experiments. Many arguments attempt to sidestep these issues by considering the
system of interest coupled to a large external one, unlike the classical case
where Boltzmann's approach for isolated systems is far more satisfactory. With
new experimental techniques, probing the quantum nature of thermalization is
now possible [3, 4]. Here, using recent advances in our understanding of
quantum thermalization [5-10] we show how to obtain the entropy as is measured
from thermodynamic experiments, solely from the self-entanglement of the
wavefunction, and find strong numerical evidence that the two are in agreement
for non-integrable systems. It is striking that this entropy, which is closely
related to the concept of heat, and generally thought of as microscopic chaotic
motion, can be determined for systems in energy eigenstates which are
stationary in time and therefore not chaotic, but instead have a very complex
spatial dependence.

  A new algorithm for reconstructing signals with sparse spectrum from noisy

the signal structure into account for estimating the unknown parameters which
are the frequencies and the amplitudes of linearly combined sinusoidal signals.
A high-resolution spectral estimation method is used to recover the frequencies
of the signal elements, while the amplitudes of the signal components are
estimated by minimizing the squared norm of the compressed estimation error
using the least squares technique. The Cramer-Rao bound for the given system
model is also derived. It is shown that the proposed algorithm approaches the

short-range wakefield effects are included analytically, the approach can be
much more efficient than ordinary (non-IGF) approaches in situations where the
wake function and charge density have disparate spatial scales. Two cases are
presented: one derived from the full wake including short-range effects, and
one derived from the asymptotic wake. In the latter case the algorithm contains
the same physics as others based on the asymptotic approximation, but requires
only the line charge density and not its derivative. Examples are presented
that illustrate the limitations of the asymptotic-wake approximation, and that
illustrate how microbunching can increase the CSR fields by orders of magnitude

develop two algorithms. The objective function of the problem is represented as
a product of quadratic ratios and parameterized so that its convex part (versus
the concave part) contains only one (or two) optimization variables. One of the
algorithms is called POlynomial-Time DC (POTDC) and is based on semi-definite

single parameter. The other algorithm is called RAte-maximization via
Generalized EigenvectorS (RAGES) and is based on the generalized eigenvectors
method and an iterative search over two (or one, in its approximate version)

paper deals with the basic concepts, mathematics, and design aspects of a
control for nonlinear systems that make the chattering effect lower. As
solution to this problem we will adopt as a starting point the high order
sliding mode approaches then the PID sliding surface. Simulation results show
that this control strategy can attain excellent control performance with no

and surface roughness on spherical electric double layers in electrolyte
solutions with divalent counter-ions in the setting of the primitive model. By
using Monte Carlo simulations and the image charge method, the zeta potential
profile and the integrated charge distribution function are computed for
varying surface charge strengths and salt concentrations. Systematic
comparisons were carried out between three distinct models for interfacial
charges: 1) SURF1 with uniform surface charges, 2) SURF2 with discrete point
charges on the interface, and 3) SURF3 with discrete interfacial charges and
finite excluded volume. By comparing the integrated charge distribution
function (ICDF) and potential profile, we argue that the potential at the
distance of one ion diameter from the macroion surface is a suitable location
to define the zeta potential. In SURF2 model, we find that image charge effects
strongly enhance charge inversion for monovalent interfacial charges, and
strongly suppress charge inversion for multivalent interfacial charges. For
SURF3, the image charge effect becomes much smaller. Finally, with image
charges in action, we find that excluded volumes (in SURF3) suppress charge
inversion for monovalent interfacial charges and enhance charge inversion for
multivalent interfacial charges. Overall, our results demonstrate that all
these aspects, i.e., image charges, interfacial charge discreteness, their
excluding volumes have significant impacts on the zeta potential, and thus the
structure of electric double layers.

complexity of IT systems is becoming an obstacle that hampers the
manageability, operability, and maintainability of modern computing
infrastructures. Autonomic computing popped up to provide an answer to these
ever-growing pitfalls. Fundamentally, autonomic systems are self-configuring,
self-healing, self-optimizing, and self-protecting; hence, they can automate
all complex IT processes without human intervention. This paper proposes an
autonomic HTML web-interface generator based on XML Schema and Style Sheet
specifications for self-configuring graphical user interfaces of web
applications. The goal of this autonomic generator is to automate the process
of customizing GUI web-interfaces according to the ever-changing business
rules, policies, and operating environment with the least IT labor involvement.
The conducted experiments showed a successful automation of web interfaces
customization that dynamically self-adapts to keep with the always-changing
business requirements. Future research can improve upon the proposed solution
so that it supports the selfconfiguring of not only web applications but also

extend up to \sim 11 kpc. In addition to the main lanes, several filamentary
structures of dust originating from the central starburst are also evident.
Though, the dust is surrounded by exotic environment, the average extinction
curve derived for this target galaxy is compatible with the Galactic curve,
with RV =3.05, and imply that the dust grains responsible for the optical
extinction in the target galaxy are not really different than the canonical
grains in the Milky Way. Our estimate of total dust content of NGC 1482
assuming screening effect of dust is \sim 2.7 \times 10^5 Msun, and provide
lower limit due to the fact that our method is not sensitive to the intermix
component of dust. Comparison of the observed dust in the galaxy with that
supplied by the SNe to the ISM, imply that this supply is not sufficient to
account for the observed dust and hence point towards the origin of dust in

dynamics and pattern formation of active particles. We focus on simple models
of active dynamics with a particular emphasis on nonlinear and stochastic
dynamics of such self-propelled entities in the framework of statistical
mechanics. Examples of such active units in complex physico-chemical and
biological systems are chemically powered nano-rods, localized patterns in
reaction-diffusion system, motile cells or macroscopic animals. Based on the
description of individual motion of point-like active particles by stochastic
differential equations, we discuss different velocity-dependent friction
functions, the impact of various types of fluctuations and calculate
characteristic observables such as stationary velocity distributions or
diffusion coefficients. Finally, we consider not only the free and confined
individual active dynamics but also different types of interaction between
active particles. The resulting collective dynamical behavior of large
assemblies and aggregates of active units is discussed and an overview over
some recent results on spatiotemporal pattern formation in such systems is
given.

Hamiltonian dynamical system to which a dissipation is added. Such a system is
governed by two parameters, named the perturbing and dissipative parameters,
and it depends on a drift function. Assuming that the frequency of motion
satisfies some resonance assumption, we investigate the stability of the
dynamics, and precisely the variation of the action variables associated to the
conservative model. According to the structure of the vector field, one can
find linear and exponential stability times, which are established under
smallness con- ditions on the parameters. We also provide some applications to
concrete examples, which exhibit a linear or exponential stability behavior.

the periods of 2000-2010 and proposed a classification scheme for the articles.
One thousands (1000) articles have been identified, and around 100 relevant
selected articles have been subsequently reviewed and classified based on the
major focus of each paper. Findings of this study indicated that the research
area of ANN based applications are receiving most research attention and self
organizing map based applications are second in position to be used in
segmentation. The commonly used models for market segmentation are data mining,
intelligent system etc. Our analysis furnishes a roadmap to guide future

daily realizations of a given stochastic process, we first demonstrate that the
scaling properties of the aggregated return distribution can be employed to
define a martingale stochastic model which consistently replicates conditioned
expectations of the S&P 500 high frequency data in the morning of each trading
day. Then, a more general formulation of the above scaling properties allows to
extend the model to the afternoon trading session. We finally outline an
application in which conditioned forecasting is used to implement a
trend-following trading strategy capable of exploiting linear correlations
present in the S&P dataset and absent in the model. Trading signals are
model-based and not derived from chartist criteria. In-sample and out-of-sample
tests indicate that the model-based trading strategy performs better than a
benchmark one established on an asymmetric GARCH process, and show the
existence of small arbitrage opportunities. We remark that in the absence of
linear correlations the trading profit would vanish and discuss why the trading
strategy is potentially interesting to hedge volatility risk for S&P
index-based products.

  theory for closed populations","26 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Mathematical Modelling of Natural
  Phenomena",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a unified mathematical approach to epidemiological models with
parametric heterogeneity, i.e., to the models that describe individuals in the
population as having specific parameter (trait) values that vary from one
individuals to another. This is a natural framework to model, e.g.,
heterogeneity in susceptibility or infectivity of individuals. We review, along
with the necessary theory, the results obtained using the discussed approach.
In particular, we formulate and analyze an SIR model with distributed
susceptibility and infectivity, showing that the epidemiological models for
closed populations are well suited to the suggested framework. A number of
known results from the literature is derived, including the final epidemic size
equation for an SIR model with distributed susceptibility. It is proved that
the bottom up approach of the theory of heterogeneous populations with
parametric heterogeneity allows to infer the population level description,
which was previously used without a firm mechanistic basis; in particular, the
power law transmission function is shown to be a consequence of the initial
gamma distributed susceptibility and infectivity. We discuss how the general
theory can be applied to the modeling goals to include the heterogeneous
contact population structure and provide analysis of an SI model with
heterogeneous contacts. We conclude with a number of open questions and
promising directions, where the theory of heterogeneous populations can lead to
important simplifications and generalizations.

where detailed and convincing scenes are much required, procedural scene
generation is a big helping tool for artists. A problem is that defining scene
descriptions through these procedures usually requires a knowledge in formal
language grammars, programming theory and manually editing textual files using
a strict syntax, making it less intuitive to use. Luckily, graphical user
interfaces has made a lot of tasks on computers easier to perform and out of
the belief that creating computer programs can also be one of them, visual
programming languages (VPLs) have emerged. The goal in VPLs is to shift more
work from the programmer to the integrated development environment (IDE),
making programming an user-friendlier task.
  In this thesis, an approach of using a VPL for defining procedures that
automatically generate virtual scenes is presented. The methods required to
build a VPL are presented, including a novel method of generating readable code
in a structured programming language. Also, the methods for achieving basic
principles of VPLs will be shown -- suitable visual presentation of information
and guiding the programmer in the right direction using constraints. On the
other hand, procedural generation methods are presented in the context of
visual programming -- adapting the application programming interface (API) of
these methods to better serve the user. The main focus will be on the methods
for urban modeling, such as building, city layout and details generation with
random number generation used to create non-deterministic scenes.
