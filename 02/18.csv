context of the proposed Blue Waters systems, which is planned to be the largest
NSF-funded supercomputer when it begins production use in 2012. The aim of this
report is to inform the BW project about MTC, including understanding aspects
of MTC applications that can be used to characterize the domain and
understanding the implications of these aspects to middleware and policies.
Many MTC applications do not neatly fit the stereotypes of high-performance
computing (HPC) or high-throughput computing (HTC) applications. Like HTC
applications, by definition MTC applications are structured as graphs of
discrete tasks, with explicit input and output dependencies forming the graph
edges. However, MTC applications have significant features that distinguish
them from typical HTC applications. In particular, different engineering
constraints for hardware and software must be met in order to support these
applications. HTC applications have traditionally run on platforms such as
grids and clusters, through either workflow systems or parallel programming
systems. MTC applications, in contrast, will often demand a short time to
solution, may be communication intensive or data intensive, and may comprise
very short tasks. Therefore, hardware and software for MTC must be engineered
to support the additional communication and I/O and must minimize task dispatch
overheads. The hardware of large-scale HPC systems, with its high degree of
parallelism and support for intensive communication, is well suited for MTC
applications. However, HPC systems often lack a dynamic resource-provisioning
feature, are not ideal for task communication via the file system, and have an
I/O system that is not optimized for MTC-style applications. Hence, additional
software support is likely to be required to gain full benefit from the HPC
hardware.

modulo an arbitrary constant k>1. These problems are known to be complete for
the logspace modular counting classes {Mod_k L} = {coMod_k L} in special case
that k is prime (Buntrock et al, 1992). By considering variants of standard

Gaussian copula, which offers a simple procedure for recovering the dependence
that is lost in the estimation of the ensemble BMA marginals. Our method is
applied to 48-h forecasts of a set of five weather quantities using the

recovers many well-understood dependencies between weather quantities and
subsequently improves calibration and sharpness over both the raw ensemble and
a method which does not incorporate joint distributional information.

2-dimensional projective translation equation, or PrTE,
(1-z)f(X)=f(f(Xz)(1-z)/z); here f(X)=(u(x,y),v(x,y)) is a pair of two (real or
complex) functions. Solutions of this functional equation are called projective
flows. A vector field of a rational flow is a pair of 2-homogenic rational
functions. On the other hand, only special pairs of 2-homogenic rational
functions give rise to rational flows. In this paper we are interested in all
non-singular (satisfying the boundary condition) and unramified (without
branching points, i.e. single-valued functions in C^2\{union of curves})
projective flows whose vector field is still rational. We prove that, up to
conjugation with 1-homogenic birational plane transformation, these are of 6
types: 1) the identity flow; 2) one flow for each non-negative integer N -
these flows are rational of level N; 3) the level 1 exponential flow, which is
also conjugate to the level 1 tangent flow; 4) the level 3 flow expressable in
terms of Dixonian (equianharmonic) elliptic functions; 5) the level 4 flow
expressable in terms of lemniscatic elliptic functions; 6) the level 6 flow
expressable in terms of Dixonian elliptic functions again. This reveals another
aspect of the PrTE: in the latter four cases this equation is equivalent and
provides a uniform framework to addition formulas for exponential, tangent, or
special elliptic functions (also addition formulas for polynomials and the
logarithm, though the latter appears only in branched flows). Moreover, the
PrTE turns out to have a connection with Polya-Eggenberger urn models. Another
purpose of this study is expository, and we provide the list of open problems
and directions in the theory of PrTE; for example, we define the notion of
quasi-rational projective flows which includes curves of arbitrary genus.

system of point charges, can exist in a magnetized state, and thus remain
confined, inasmuch as it is in an ordered state of motion, with the charged
particles performing gyrational motions transverse to the field. Here we give
an estimate of a threshold, beyond which transverse motion become chaotic, the
electrons being unable to perform even one gyration, so that a breakdown should
occur, with complete loss of confinement. The estimate is obtained by the
methods of perturbation theory, taking as perturbing force acting on each
electron that due to the so--called microfield, i.e., the electric field
produced by all the other charges. We first obtain a general relation for the
threshold, which involves the fluctuations of the microfield. Then, taking for
such fluctuations the fomula given by Iglesias, Lebowitz and MacGowan for the
model of a one component plasma with neutralizing background, we obtain a
definite formula for the threshold, which corresponds to a density limit
increasing as the square of the imposed magnetic field. Such a theoretical
density limit is found to fit pretty well the empirical data for collapses of
fusion machines.

immersion $W_{0}^{1,p}(\Omega)\hookrightarrow L^{q}(\Omega)$ is differentiable
at $q=p.$ Previous results on the asymptotic behavior (as $q\rightarrow p$) of
the positive solutions of the non-resonant Lane-Emden problem (i.e. with
$\lambda_{p}$ replaced by a positive $\lambda\neq\lambda_{p}$) are also
generalized to the space $C^{1}% (\bar{\Omega})$ and to arbitrary families of

obtain the first eigenpair of the $p$-Laplacian as the limit in
$C^{1}(\bar{\Omega}),$ when $q\rightarrow p$, of a suitable scaling of the pair
$(\lambda,u_{\lambda,q}).$ For computational purposes the advantage of this
approach is that $\lambda$ does not need to be close to $\lambda_{p}.$ Finally,
an explicit estimate involving $L^{\infty}$ and $L^{1}$ norms of
$u_{\lambda,q}$ is also deduced using set level techniques.

ESO/FORS2+ISAAC optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations, supported
by ATCA radio and RXTE/Swift X-ray quasi-simultaneous data. GX 339-4 was
observed at three different epochs, once in the soft state and twice in the
hard state. In the soft state, the optical and near-infrared continuum is
largely consistent with the Raleigh-Jeans tail of a thermal process. As an
explanation, we favour irradiation of the outer accretion disc by its inner
regions, enhanced by disc warping. An excess is also present at low
frequencies, likely due to a M subgiant companion star. During the first hard
state, the optical/near-infrared continuum is well-described by the optically
thin synchrotron emission of the compact jet combined with disc irradiation and
perhaps another component peaking in the ultraviolet. The spectral break where
the jet transits from the optically thick to thin regimes, located below
1.20e14 Hz, is not detected and the extension of the optically thin synchrotron
is consistent with the 3-50 keV spectrum. In contrast, the emission during the
second hard state is more difficult to understand and points toward a more
complex jet continuum. In both cases, the near-infrared continuum is found to
be variable at timescales at least as short as 20 s, although these
variabilities are smoothed out beyond a few hundred seconds. This implies rapid
variations - in flux and frequency - of the location of the spectral break,
i.e. dramatic short timescale changes of the physical conditions at the base of
the jet, such as the magnetic field and/or the base radius.

continuum single particle level density (CSPLD) contains information about the
continuum energy spectrum. The question whether one can use the Hamiltonian
with constant pairing strength for correlations in the continuum is still
unanswered. In this paper we generalize the Richardson exact solution for the
pairing Hamiltonian including correlations in the continuum. The resonant and
non-resonant continuum are included through the CSPLD. The resonant
correlations are made explicit by using the Cauchy theorem. Low lying states
with seniority zero and two are calculated for the even Carbon isotopes. We
conclude that energy levels can indeed be calculated with constant pairing in
the continuum using the CSPLD. It is found that the nucleus $^{24}$C is
unbound. The real and complex energy representation of the continuum is
developed and their differences are shown. The trajectory of the pair energies
in the continuum for the nucleus $^{28}$C is shown.

interventions that might be deployed by a search provider: blacklisting
infected web pages by removing them from search results entirely and a
generalization of blacklisting, called depreferencing, in which a website's
ranking is decreased by a fixed percentage each time period the site remains
infected. We analyze and study the trade-offs between infection exposure and
traffic loss due to false positives (the cost to a website that is incorrectly
blacklisted) for different interventions. As expected, we find that
interventions are most effective when websites are slow to remove infections.
Surprisingly, we also find that low infection or recovery rates can increase
traffic loss due to false positives. Our analysis also shows that heavy-tailed
distributions of website popularity, as documented in many studies, leads to
high sample variance of all measured outcomes. These result implies that it
will be difficult to determine empirically whether certain website

the one described in this paper have an important role to play in improving web

substantial benefits over generic least-squares fits. In particular, the
Bayesian approach takes into account the full prior distribution of the model
parameters, such as the a priori distances, and refits these parameters as part
of the process of settling on the most highly-constrained final fit.
Additionally, the Bayesian approach can naturally ingest data from multiple
wavebands and simultaneously fit the parameters of PL relations for each
waveband in a procedure that constrains the parameter posterior distributions
so as to minimize the scatter of the final fits appropriately in all wavebands.
Here we describe the generalized approach to Bayesian model fitting and then
specialize to a detailed description of applying Bayesian linear model fitting
to the mid-infrared PL relations of RR Lyrae variable stars. For this example
application we quantify the improvement afforded by using a Bayesian model fit.
We also compare distances previously predicted in our example application to
recently published parallax distances measured with the Hubble Space Telescope
and find their agreement to be a vindication of our methodology. Our intent
with this article is to spread awareness of the benefits and applicability of
this Bayesian approach and encourage future PL relation investigations to
consider employing this powerful analysis method.

spectroscopic and photometric behaviour in order to determine their
evolutionary status. The long-term datasets revealed that they are remarkably
stable over long periods (>40yr), with the possible exception of zeta Sco prior
to the 20th century, in contrast to the typical excursions that characterise
luminous blue variables (LBVs). Zeta Sco, HD190603 and BP Cru possess physical
properties intermediate between B supergiants and LBVs; we therefore suggest
that BHGs are the immediate descendants and progenitors (respectively) of such
stars (for initial masses in the range ~30-60Msun). In contrast, while the wind
properties of Cyg OB2 #12 are consistent with this hypothesis, the combination
of extreme luminosity and spectroscopic mass (~110Msun) and comparatively low
temperature means it cannot be accommodated in such a scheme. Likewise, despite
its co-location with several LBVs above the Humphreys-Davidson (HD) limit, the
lack of long term variability and its unevolved chemistry apparently excludes
such an identification. Since such massive stars are not expected to evolve to
such cool temperatures, the properties of Cyg OB2 #12 are difficult to

infer that DCN forms at a smaller radii and thus at higher temperatures than
DCO+. This is consistent with chemical network model predictions of DCO+
formation from H2D+ at T<30 K and DCN formation from additional pathways
involving CH2D+ at higher temperatures. We estimate a DCN/HCN abundance ratio

Gravitationally Confined Detonation (GCD) model of Type Ia supernovae SNe Ia.
This model is analogous to the previous GCD model reported in Jordan et
al.(2008); however, the chosen initial conditions produce a substantively
different detonation mechanism, resulting from a larger energy release during
the deflagration phase. The resulting final kinetic energy and nickel-56 yields
conform better to observational values than is the case for the ""classical"" GCD
models. In the present class of models, the ignition of a deflagration phase
leads to a rising, burning plume of ash. The ash breaks out of the surface of
the white dwarf, flows laterally around the star, and converges on the
collision region at the antipodal point from where it broke out. The amount of
energy released during the deflagration phase is enough to cause the star to
rapidly expand, so that when the ash reaches the antipodal point, the surface
density is too low to initiate a detonation. Instead, as the ash flows into the
collision region (while mixing with surface fuel), the star reaches its
maximally expanded state and then contracts. The stellar contraction acts to
increase the density of the star, including the density in the collision
region. This both raises the temperature and density of the fuel-ash mixture in
the collision region and ultimately leads to thermodynamic conditions that are
necessary for the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism to produce a detonation. We
demonstrate feasibility of this scenario with three 3-dimensional (3D), full
star simulations of this model using the FLASH code. We characterized the
simulations by the energy released during the deflagration phase, which ranged
from 38% to 78% of the white dwarf's binding energy. We show that the necessary
conditions for detonation are achieved in all three of the models.

predicted by linear theory was observed in simulations. In this paper, we try
to provide an intuitive physical understanding of why this shift occurs,
explaining in more pedagogical detail earlier perturbation theory calculations.
We find that the shift is mainly due to the following physical effect. A
measurement of the BAO scale is more sensitive to regions with long wavelength
overdensities than underdensities, because (due to non-linear growth and bias)
these overdense regions contain larger fluctuations and more tracers and hence
contribute more to the total correlation function. In overdense regions the BAO
scale shrinks because such regions locally behave as positively curved closed
universes, and hence a smaller scale than predicted by linear theory is
measured in the total correlation function. Other effects which also contribute
to the shift are briefly discussed. We provide approximate analytic expressions
for the non-linear shift including a brief discussion of biased tracers and
explain why reconstruction should entirely reverse the shift. Our expressions
and findings are in agreement with simulation results, and confirm that
non-linear shifts should not be problematic for next-generation BAO
measurements.

the peak intensities of cooler channels or spectral lines are reached at
progressively later times than hotter channels. This time lag is understood to
be the result of hot coronal loop plasma cooling through these lower respective
temperatures. However, loops typically comprise only a minority of the total
emission in active regions. Is this cooling pattern a common property of active
region coronal plasma, or does it only occur in unique circumstances,
locations, and times? The new SDO/AIA data provide a wonderful opportunity to
answer this question systematically for an entire active region. We measure the
time lag between pairs of SDO/AIA EUV channels using 24 hours of images of AR
11082 observed on 19 June 2010. We find that there is a time-lag signal
consistent with cooling plasma, just as is usually found for loops, throughout
the active region including the diffuse emission between loops for the entire
24 hour duration. The pattern persists consistently for all channel pairs and
choice of window length within the 24 hour time period, giving us confidence
that the plasma is cooling from temperatures of greater than 3 MK, and
sometimes exceeding 7 MK, down to temperatures lower than ~ 0.8 MK. This
suggests that the bulk of the emitting coronal plasma in this active region is
not steady; rather, it is dynamic and constantly evolving. These measurements

segmenting an unknown number of subspaces of unknown and varying dimensions
from sample data points. We represent the subspaces with a set of homogeneous
polynomials whose degree is the number of subspaces and whose derivatives at a
data point give normal vectors to the subspace passing through the point. When
the number of subspaces is known, we show that these polynomials can be
estimated linearly from data; hence, subspace segmentation is reduced to
classifying one point per subspace. We select these points optimally from the
data set by minimizing certain distance function, thus dealing automatically
with moderate noise in the data. A basis for the complement of each subspace is
then recovered by applying standard PCA to the collection of derivatives
(normal vectors). Extensions of GPCA that deal with data in a high- dimensional
space and with an unknown number of subspaces are also presented. Our
experiments on low-dimensional data show that GPCA outperforms existing
algebraic algorithms based on polynomial factorization and provides a good
initialization to iterative techniques such as K-subspaces and Expectation
Maximization. We also present applications of GPCA to computer vision problems
such as face clustering, temporal video segmentation, and 3D motion
segmentation from point correspondences in multiple affine views.

magnetic field from the Sun into the corona and interplanetary space. They are
the most significant drivers of adverse space weather at Earth and other
locations in the heliosphere, so it is important to understand the physics
governing their eruption and propagation. However the diffuse morphology and
transient nature of CMEs makes them difficult to identify and track using
traditional image processing techniques. In this thesis the implementation of
multiscale image processing techniques to identify and track the CME front
through coronagraph images is detailed. An ellipse characterisation of the CME
front is used to determine the CME kinematics and morphology with increased
precision as compared to techniques used in current CME catalogues, and efforts
are underway to automate this procedure for applying to a large number of CME
observations for future analysis. It was found that CMEs do not simply undergo
constant acceleration, but rather tend to show a higher acceleration early in
their propagation. The angular width of CMEs was also found to change as they
propagate, normally increasing with height from the Sun. However these results
were derived from plane-of-sky measurements with no correction for how the true
CME geometry and direction affect the kinematics and morphology observed. With
the advent of the unique dual perspectives of the STEREO spacecraft, the
multiscale methods were extended to an elliptical tie-pointing technique in
order reconstruct the front of a CME in three-dimensions. Applying this
technique to the Earth-directed CME of 12 December 2008 allowed an accurate
determination of its true kinematics and morphology, and the CME was found to
undergo early acceleration, non-radial motion, angular width expansion, and
aerodynamic drag in the solar wind as it propagated towards Earth.

model of flavor for quarks and leptons was proposed with two 10 and one 126
contributing to fermion masses. An important aspect of this model is that
Yukawa couplings emerge dynamically from minimization of the flavon potential,
thereby reducing the number of parameters considerably. We make a detailed
numerical analysis of this model for fermion mixings including SUSY threshold
effects at the TeV scale and type-I corrections to a type-II dominant seesaw
for neutrino masses. This is a single-step breaking model with SUSY SO(10)
broken at the Grand Unified Theory (GUT)-scale of 2x10^16 GeV to the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). The minimal model has only 11 parameters,
and therefore, the charged fermion fits predict the masses (up to an overall
scale) and mixings in the neutrino sector. We present correlations for the
different predictions in the neutrino mixing parameters. The recent
experimental ""large"" \theta_{13} value of \sim 9 degrees can be obtained by a
simple extension of the minimal model. We also find that proton decay mode p ->
K^+\bar{\nu}_\mu has a partial lifetime of \sim10^34 yrs, which is within reach
of the next round of planned proton decay searches. The successful fit for
fermion masses requires the Higgs mass to be below 129 GeV in this model. If
the Higgs mass lies between 120-128 GeV, as suggested by the recent LHC data,
we find a lower limit on the light stop mass of 755 (211) GeV for \mu>0 (<0).

  We also leverage mechanisms from Quire to allow the remote server to validate

this work, the prospects of detecting inspiral signals prior to coalescence,

exhibiting the properties of neutralino (WIMP) cold dark matter (CDM). However,
the recent evidence from Atlas and CMS on a light Higgs scalar with mass
m_h\simeq 125 GeV highly constrains the superparticle mass spectrum, which in
turn constrains the neutralino annihilation mechanisms in the early universe.
We find that stau and stop co-annihilation mechanisms -- already highly
stressed by the latest Atlas/CMS results on SUSY searches -- are nearly
eliminated if indeed the light Higgs scalar has mass m_h\simeq 125 GeV.
Furthermore, neutralino annihilation via the A-resonance is essentially ruled
out in mSUGRA so that it is exceedingly difficult to generate
thermally-produced neutralino-only dark matter at the measured abundance. The
remaining possibility lies in the focus-point region which now moves out to
m_0\sim 10-20 TeV range due to the required large trilinear soft SUSY breaking
term A_0. The remaining HB/FP region is more fine-tuned than before owing to
the typically large top squark masses. We present updated direct and indirect
detection rates for neutralino dark matter, and show that ton scale noble
liquid detectors will either discover mixed higgsino CDM or essentially rule
out thermally-produced neutralino-only CDM in the mSUGRA model.

interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar gas and radiation fields of
the Milky Way. Observations of these diffuse emissions provide a tool to study
cosmic-ray origin and propagation, and the interstellar medium. We present
measurements from the first 21 months of the Fermi-LAT mission and compare with
models of the diffuse gamma-ray emission generated using the GALPROP code. The
models are fitted to cosmic-ray data and incorporate astrophysical input for
the distribution of cosmic-ray sources, interstellar gas and radiation fields.
To assess uncertainties associated with the astrophysical input, a grid of
models is created by varying within observational limits the distribution of
cosmic-ray sources, the size of the cosmic-ray confinement volume (halo), and
the distribution of interstellar gas. An all-sky maximum-likelihood fit is used
to determine the Xco-factor, the ratio between integrated CO-line intensity and
molecular hydrogen column density, the fluxes and spectra of the gamma-ray
point sources from the first Fermi-LAT catalogue, and the intensity and
spectrum of the isotropic background including residual cosmic rays that were
misclassified as gamma rays, all of which have some dependency on the assumed
diffuse emission model. The models are compared on the basis of their maximum
likelihood ratios as well as spectra, longitude, and latitude profiles. We also
provide residual maps for the data following subtraction of the diffuse
emission models. The models are consistent with the data at high and
intermediate latitudes but under-predict the data in the inner Galaxy for
energies above a few GeV. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are
discussed, including the contribution by undetected point source populations
and spectral variations of cosmic rays throughout the Galaxy. [Abridged]

recently discovered two distinct populations in scatter plots of this ratio
must not bee interpreted in terms of 'uncollapsed' and 'collapsed' fields but
they stem from weak granular magnetic fields and weak canopy fields located at
the boundaries between granules and the intergranular space. Based on new
simulation runs, we reaffirm earlier findings of a predominance of the
horizontal field components over the vertical one, particularly in the upper
photosphere and at the base of the chromosphere.

varieties of general type. Using Landau-Ginzburg mirrors as motivation, we
describe the mirror of a hypersurface of general type (and more generally
varieties of non-negative Kodaira dimension) as the critical locus of the zero
fibre of a certain Landau-Ginzburg potential. The critical locus carries a
perverse sheaf of vanishing cycles. Our main results shows that one obtains the
interchange of Hodge numbers expected in mirror symmetry. This exchange is
between the Hodge numbers of the hypersurface and certain Hodge numbers defined
using a mixed Hodge structure on the hypercohomology of the perverse sheaf.
This exchange can be anticipated from an analysis of Hochschild homology of the
relevant categories arising in homological mirror symmetry in this case; we
also conjecture that a similar, but different, exchange of dimensions arises
from Hochschild cohomology, relating the cohomology of sheaves of polyvector
fields on the hypersurface to the cohomology of the critical locus.

important for two reasons: it plays a role in the facial reduction algorithm of
Borwein and Wolkowicz, and the question whether the linear image of a nice cone

  We prove several characterizations of nice cones and show a strong connection

fluctuation of photon noise, shot noise of faint sources, and Galactic cirrus.
The fluctuations at a few arcminutes scales at short mid-infrared wavelengths

ignites the research of the nonlocality distillation. The first protocol
presented in Ref[Phys. Rev. Lett. 102, 120401] shows that the nonlocality of
bipartite binary-input and binary-output nonsignaling correlated boxes could be
amplified by 'wiring' two copies of weaker-nonlocality boxes. Several optimized
distillation protocols were presented later for bipartite binary-input and
binary-output nonsignaling correlated boxes. In this paper, we focus on the
bipartite binary-input and multi-nary-output nonsignaling correlated
boxes---high-dimensional boxes, and design comparators-based protocols to
achieve the distillation of high-dimensional nonlocality. The results show that
the high-dimensional nonlocality can be distilled in different ways, and we
find that the efficiencies of the protocols are influenced not only by the
wirings but also by the classes the initial nonlocality boxes belongs to. Here,
the initial nonlcalities may have the same violation of the high-dimensional
Bell-type inequality, but they can fall into different classes, which shows
that the value of the violation of the high-dimensional Bell-type inequality is
not the only representation of nonlocality, and the combination manner(classes)
in the expression of the correlated boxes is another important nonlocal
representation too. The current protocols are compatible with the previous
two-dimensional nonlocality distillation protocols, but our protocols are more
powerful and universal than previous ones in the sense that the current
protocols can be applied to the system with any dimension rather than the only
two-dimension system in the previous protocols.

gravity with $T$ being the torsion scalar. We reconstruct a model of $f(T)$
gravity with realizing the finite-time future singularities. In addition, it is
explicitly shown that a power-low type correction term $T^\beta$ ($\beta>1$)
such as a $T^2$ term can remove the finite-time future singularities in $f(T)$
gravity. Moreover, we study $f(T)$ models with realizing inflation in the early
universe, the $\Lambda$CDM model, Little Rip cosmology and Pseudo-Rip
cosmology. It is demonstrated that the disintegration of bound structures for
Little Rip and Pseudo-Rip cosmologies occurs in the same way as in gravity with
corresponding dark energy fluid. We also discuss that the time-dependent matter
instability in the star collapse can occur in $f(T)$ gravity. Furthermore, we
explore thermodynamics in $f(T)$ gravity and illustrate that the second law of
thermodynamics can be satisfied around the finite-time future singularities for
the universe with the temperature inside the horizon being the same as that of
the apparent horizon.

which is based on coding theory. Theoretically, every linear code can be used
to construct secret sharing schemes. However, in general, determining the
access structures of the schemes based on linear codes is very hard. This paper
proposed the concept of minimal linear code, which makes the determination of
the access structures of the schemes based on the duals of minimal linear codes
easier. It is proved that the shortening codes of minimal linear codes are also
minimal ones. Then the conditions whether several types of irreducible cyclic
codes are minimal linear codes are presented. Furthermore, the access
structures of secret sharing schemes based on the duals of minimal linear codes
are studied, and these access structures in specific examples are obtained
through programming.

cover many theoretical dark energy models. After constraining the parameter
space of this parametrization by using the current cosmological observations,

\sum_{i=1}^m C_i^p for a fixed value of p such that 0<p<\infty. For p>1 the
minimization problem is equivalent to the well-known problem of minimizing the
\ell_p norm of the vector of the completion times of the machines, and for
0<p<1 the maximization problem is of interest. Our main result is an efficient
polynomial time approximation scheme (EPTAS) for each one of these problems.
Our schemes use a non-standard application of the so-called shifting technique.
We focus on the work (total size of jobs) assigned to each machine and
introduce intervals of forbidden work. These intervals are defined so that the
resulting effect on the goal function is sufficiently small. This allows the
partition of the problem into sub-problems (with subsets of machines and jobs)
whose solutions are combined into the final solution using dynamic programming.
Our results are the first EPTAS's for this natural class of load balancing

positive sizes no larger than 1 into a minimum number of subsets (called bins)
each having a total size of at most 1. In bin packing games, an item has a
positive weight, and given a valid packing or partition of the items, each item
has a cost or a payoff associated with it. We study a class of bin packing
games where the payoff of an item is the ratio between its weight and the total
weight of items packed with it, that is, the cost sharing is based linearly on
the weights of items. We study several types of pure Nash equilibria: standard
Nash equilibria, strong equilibria, strictly Pareto optimal equilibria, and
weakly Pareto optimal equilibria. We show that any game of this class admits
all these types of equilibria. We study the (asymptotic) prices of anarchy and
stability (PoA and PoS) of the problem with respect to these four types of
equilibria, for the two cases of general weights and of unit weights. We show
that while the case of general weights is strongly related to the well-known
First Fit algorithm, and all the four PoA values are equal to 1.7, this is not
true for unit weights. In particular, we show that all of them are strictly
below 1.7, the strong PoA is equal to approximately 1.691 (another well-known
number in bin packing) while the strictly Pareto optimal PoA is much lower. We
show that all the PoS values are equal to 1, except for those of strong
equilibria, which is equal to 1.7 for general weights, and to approximately
1.611824 for unit weights. This last value is not known to be the (asymptotic)
approximation ratio of any well-known algorithm for bin packing. Finally, we
study convergence to equilibria.

eigenvalues of the angular velocity matrix are pairwise distinct. However, if
some eigenvalues of the angular velocity matrix of a stationary rotation

The search is sensitive to both the standard model Higgs boson and to the

standard model (MSSM). No excess of events is observed in the tau-pair
invariant-mass spectrum. For a standard model Higgs boson in the mass range of

production cross section 3.2 times of that predicted by the standard model. In
the MSSM, upper limits on the neutral Higgs boson production cross section
times branching fraction to tau pairs, as a function of the pseudoscalar Higgs
boson mass, m(A), sets stringent new bounds in the parameter space, excluding
