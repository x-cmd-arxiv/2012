understanding of fluid systems. Contour advection simulations provide a good
model of the phenomenon by tracking the evolution of one or more contours or
isolines of a trace substance to a high level of precision. The most accurate
method of validating an advected contour is to divide the tracer concentration
into discrete ranges and perform a maximum likelihood classification, a method
that we term, ""isoline retrieval."" Conditional probabilities generated as a
result provide excellent error characterization.
  In this study, a water vapour isoline of 0.001 mass-mixing-ratio is advected
over five days in the upper troposphere and compared with high-resolution AMSU
(Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) satellite retrievals. The goal is to find
the same fine-scale, chaotic mixing in the isoline retrievals as seen in the
advection simulations. Some of the filaments generated by the simulations show
up in the conditional probabilities as areas of reduced probability. By
rescaling the probabilities, the filaments may be revealed in the isoline
retrievals proper with little effect on the overall accuracy. Limitations
imposed by the specific context, i.e. water-vapour retrieved with AMSU in the
upper troposphere, are discussed. Nonetheless, isoline retrieval is shown to be
a highly effective technique for atmospheric sounding, showing good agreement
with both ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts)
assimilation data and radiosonde measurements.

the open loop zeros of the equivalent PID controller towards greater damping

excitation energies is analyzed as a function of the density-dependence of the
symmetry energy for a set of relativistic effective interactions. The
occurrence of PDS is predicted in the response to both the isovector and
isoscalar dipole operators, and its strength is enhanced with the increase of
the symmetry energy at saturation and the slope of the symmetry energy. In both
channels the PDS exhausts a relatively small fraction of the energy-weighted
sum rule but a much larger percentage of the inverse energy-weighted sum rule.
For the isovector dipole operator the reduced transition probability $B(E1)$ of
the PDS is generally small because of pronounced cancellation of neutron and
proton partial contributions. The isoscalar reduced transition amplitude is
predominantly determined by neutron particle-hole configurations, most of which
add coherently, and this results in a collective response of the PDS to the
isoscalar dipole operator.

general tensor networks such as the multi-scale entanglement renormalization
ansatz (MERA). In this paper, the focus is on the application of the
non-abelian framework within the NRG. A detailed analysis is given for a fully
screened spin-3/2 three-channel Anderson impurity model in the presence of
conservation of total spin, particle-hole symmetry, and SU(3) channel symmetry.
The same system is analyzed using several alternative symmetry scenarios. This
includes the more traditional symmetry setting SU(2)^4, the larger symmetry
SU(2)*U(1)*SU(3), and their much larger enveloping symplectic symmetry
SU(2)*Sp(6). These are compared in detail, including their respective dramatic
gain in numerical efficiency. In the appendix, finally, an extensive
introduction to non-abelian symmetries is given for practical applications,
together with simple self-contained numerical procedures to obtain

of stable minimum/non-minimum phase higher order processes is introduced and
its advantage in frequency domain tuning of FOPID controllers is also
presented. The time domain optimal tuning of FOPID controllers have also been
carried out to handle these higher order processes by performing optimization

sample with a parametric estimate of the cumulative distribution function is
known as the empirical process with estimated parameters and has been
extensively employed in the literature for goodness-of-fit testing. The
simplest way to carry out such goodness-of-fit tests, especially in a
multivariate setting, is to use a parametric bootstrap. Although very easy to
implement, the parametric bootstrap can become very computationally expensive
as the sample size, the number of parameters, or the dimension of the data
increase. An alternative resampling technique based on a fast weighted
bootstrap is proposed in this paper, and is studied both theoretically and
empirically. The outcome of this work is a generic and computationally
efficient multiplier goodness-of-fit procedure that can be used as a
large-sample alternative to the parametric bootstrap. In order to approximately
determine how large the sample size needs to be for the parametric and weighted
bootstraps to have roughly equivalent powers, extensive Monte Carlo experiments
are carried out in dimension one, two and three, and for models containing up
to nine parameters. The computational gains resulting from the use of the
proposed multiplier goodness-of-fit procedure are illustrated on trivariate

large global velocity by deforming the spacetime in a bubble around the

massive particles with a range of initial velocities from -c to c interacting
with an Alcubierre warp bubble travelling at a range of globally subluminal and
superluminal velocities on both constant and variable velocity paths. The key
results for null particles match what would be expected of massive test
particles as they approach +/- c. The increase in energy for massive and null
particles is calculated in terms of v_s, the global ship velocity, and v_p, the
initial velocity of the particle with respect to the rest frame of the
origin/destination of the ship. Particles with positive v_p obtain extremely
high energy and velocity and become ""time locked"" for the duration of their
time in the bubble, experiencing very little proper time between entering and
eventually leaving the bubble. When interacting with an accelerating bubble,
any particles within the bubble at the time receive a velocity boost that
increases or decreases the magnitude of their velocity if the particle is
moving towards the front or rear of the bubble respectively. If the bubble is
decelerating, the opposite effect is observed. Thus Eulerian matter is
unaffected by bubble accelerations/decelerations. The magnitude of the velocity
boosts scales with the magnitude of the bubble acceleration/deceleration.

For the series of experimentally available biphenyl molecules, alkyl side
chains allow us to gradually adjust the torsion angle \phi\ between the two
phenyl rings from 0 to 90{\deg} and to control in this way the degree of
\pi-electron conjugation. Studying different anchoring groups and binding
positions, our theory predicts that the absolute values of the thermopower
decrease slightly towards larger torsion angles, following an a+b*cos^{2}\phi\
dependence. The anchoring group determines the sign of Q and a,b,
simultaneously. Sulfur and amine groups give rise to Q,a,b>0, while for cyano
Q,a,b<0. The different binding positions can lead to substantial variations of
the thermopower mostly due to changes in the alignment of the frontier
molecular orbital levels and the Fermi energy. We explain our ab-initio results
in terms of a \pi-orbital tight-binding model and a minimal two-level model,
which describes the pair of hybridizing frontier orbital states on the two

flows a set of self similar solutions are presented. In this paper, we have
actually tried to re-check the solution presented by Abbassi et al. (2008)

constrain that limits answers presented by Abbassi et al. 2008. In that paper
the parameter space in which it is established in the new constrain was
plotted. However, the new requirement makes up only a small parameter space
with physically acceptable solutions. And now in this manuscript we have
followed the idea with more effort, and tried to find out how thermal
conduction influences the structur of the disks in a physical parameter space.
We have found out that the existence of thermal conduction will lead to
reduction of accretion and radial and azimuthal velocities as well as the
vertical thickness of the disk, which is slightly reduced. Moreover, the
surface density of the disk will increase when the thermal conduction becomes
important in the hot magnetized flow.

cosmology, is defined for a free particle quantum wavefunction. By considering
the universe as an initial single Gaussian quantum wavepacket whose mass is
that of present-day observable universe and whose size is that of the Planck
Length at the Planck Time, it is demonstrated that this quantum expansion
parameter has a value at the present epoch of the same order as the value of
the Hubble constant. The coincidence suggests examining the effect of including
this type of quantum wave expansion in traditional general relativistic
cosmology and a sample model illustrating this is presented here. Using
standard Einstein-de Sitter cosmology ($\Omega$m = 1) it is found that cosmic
acceleration (aka dark energy) arises naturally during cosmic history. The time
at which the universe switched from deceleration to acceleration
(observationally ~7 Gyr before the present epoch) yields a value for the mass
of the wavepacket representing the universe at the Planck Time and its present
age. This same mass may then be used to obtain a curve for the cosmic expansion
rate versus z. This curve is well fit to observational data. The model is used
also to obtain an estimate of the inflationary expansion factor.

analysis of the four-point correlation function of stress-tensor multiplets,
which has been recently constructed up to six loops. The Konishi operator gives
the leading contribution to the singlet SU(4) channel of this OPE. Its
anomalous dimension is the coefficient of the leading single logarithmic
singularity of the logarithm of the correlation function in the double
short-distance limit, in which the operator positions coincide pairwise. We
regularize the logarithm of the correlation function in this singular limit by
a version of dimensional regularization. At any loop level, the resulting
singularity is a simple pole whose residue is determined by a finite two-point
integral with one loop less. This drastically simplifies the five-loop
calculation of the Konishi anomalous dimension by reducing it to a set of known
four-loop two-point integrals and two unknown integrals which we evaluate
analytically. We obtain an analytic result at five loops in the planar limit
and observe perfect agreement with the prediction based on integrability in
AdS/CFT.

between statistical-mechanical parameters - or even simpler: A phantom effect
resulting from the misinterpretation of experimental data. Here, we review EEC
from a new standpoint using the notion of correlation which is essential for
the method of factor analysis, but is not conventional in physics and
chemistry. We conclude that the EEC may be rationalized in terms of hidden (not
directly measurable with the help of the current experimental set-up) but
physically real factors, implying a Carnot-cycle model in which a micro-phase
transition (MPT) plays a crucial role. Examples of such MPTs underlying
physically valid EEC should be typically cooperative processes in
supramolecular aggregates, like changes of structured water at hydrophobic
surfaces, conformational transitions upon ligand-biopolymer binding, and so on,
so forth. The MPT notion could help rationalize the occurrence of EEC in
connection with hydration and folding of proteins,enzymatic reactions,
functioning of molecular motors, DNA de- and rehybridization, as well as
similar phenomena.

surprisingly, is expected to exhibit extreme thermal isolation. Here we
demonstrate an ultra-sensitive, wide-bandwidth measurement scheme to probe the
thermal transport and thermodynamic properties of the electron gas of graphene.
We employ Johnson noise thermometry at microwave frequency to sensitively
measure the temperature of the electron gas with resolution of $4 mK/\sqrt{Hz}$
and a bandwidth of 80 MHz. We have measured the electron-phonon coupling from
2-30 K at a charge density of $2\cdot 10^{11} cm^{-2}$. Utilizing bolometric
mixing, we have sensed temperature oscillations with period of 430 ps and have
determined the heat capacity of the electron gas to be $2\cdot 10^{-21}
J/(K\cdot \mu m^2)$ at 5 K which is consistent with that of a two dimensional,
Dirac electron gas. These measurements suggest that graphene-based devices
together with wide bandwidth noise thermometry can generate substantial
advances in the areas of ultra-sensitive bolometry, calorimetry, microwave and
terahertz photo-detection, and bolometric mixing for applications in areas such
as observational astronomy and quantum information and measurement.

prototypical Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. Using Herschel-PACS, we have detected
11 transitions in the J_upper=14-30 (E_upper/k_B = 580-2565 K) range, all of
which are consistent with arising from within the central 10"" (700 pc). The
detected transitions are modeled as arising from 2 different components: a
moderate excitation (ME) component close to the galaxy systemic velocity, and a
high excitation (HE) component that is blueshifted by ~80 km s^{-1}. We employ
a large velocity gradient (LVG) model and derive n_H2~10^{5.6} cm^{-3},
T_kin~170 K, and M_H2~10^{6.7} M_sun for the ME component, and n_H2~10^{6.4}
cm^{-3}, T_kin~570 K, and M_H2~10^{5.6} M_sun for the HE component, although
for both components the uncertainties in the density and mass are plus/minus
(0.6-0.9) dex. We compare the CO line profiles with those of other molecular
tracers observed at higher spatial and spectral resolution, and find that the
ME transitions are consistent with these lines arising in the ~200 pc diameter
ring of material traced by H_2 1-0 S(1) observations. The blueshift of the HE
lines may also be consistent with the bluest regions of this H_2 ring, but a
better kinematic match is found with a clump of infalling gas ~40 pc north of
the AGN. We discuss the prospects of placing the HE component near the AGN, and
conclude that while the moderate thermal pressure precludes an association with
the ~1 pc radius H_2O maser disk, the HE component could potentially be located
only a few parsecs more distant from the AGN, and might then provide the
N_H~10^{25} cm^{-2} column obscuring the nuclear hard X-rays. Finally, we also
report sensitive upper limits extending up to J_upper=50, which place
constraints on a previous model prediction for the CO emission from the X-ray

coupling. Free electrons on the lattice have dispersionless flat bands, and the
ground state is highly degenerate when each lattice site is occupied averagely
by one electron, i.e., the system is at half filling. The on-site Coulomb
interaction can remove the degeneracy and give rise to the ferrimagnetism,
which is the coexistence of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic long-range
orders. On the other hand the spin-orbit coupling makes the band structure
topologically non-trivial, and produces the quantum spin Hall effect with a
pair of helical edge states around the system boundary. Based on the rigorous
results for the Hubbard model, we found that the Coulomb interaction can
provide an effective staggered potential and turn the quantum spin Hall phase
into a quantum anomalous Hall phase.

operators that map the 5D space-time manifold into a 4D Lorentzian space-time
are explicitly given in matrix form. It is emphasized that the concept of
proper time is the criterion for the projection. A homogeneous 5D
energy-momentum manifold produces naturally the uncertainty principle, and from
which we obtained the 5D metric operator, together with the 5D vector and
mass-less spinor fields. A naturally coupled product of these two fields is
also a solution of the 5D metric operator. Thus the coupling constant is
identified as the unit charge. The charged mass-less spinor is coined as the
e-trino. Hence the vector field generated by such e-trinos is derived, such
that in the 4x1 Hilbert space this vector potential can be identified as the
Maxwell monopole potential. Through gauge invariance the concept of charge per
unit mass is introduced, which then leads to the mapping of the 5D
energy-momentum into that of SU(2)xL and SU(3)xL via the time-shift projection
P0 and the conformal space projection P1, respectively. The P1 projection gives
us the fractional charged quarks. These quark currents generate both the meson

one-dimensional NLS-like equations of focusing type, namely for the classical
integrable Nonlinear Schrodinger equation (1), nonintegrable NLS equation
accounting for dumping (linear dissipation, two- and three-photon absorption)
and pumping terms (2) and generalized NLS equation accounting for six-wave
interactions, dumping and pumping terms (3). All additional terms beyond the
classical NLS equation are small. As initial conditions we choose seeded by
noise modulationally unstable solutions of the considered systems in the form
of (a) condensate for systems (1)-(3) and (b) cnoidal wave for the classical
NLS equation (1). We observe 'strange' results for the classical NLS equation
(1) with condensate initial condition including peak at zeroth harmonic in
averaged over ensemble spectra, non-decaying spacial correlation functions and
a 'breathing' region on the PDFs for medium waves amplitudes where frequency of
waves appearance oscillates with time, while the far-tails of the PDFs remain
Rayleigh ones. Addition of small dumping and pumping terms in model (2) breaks
integrability that results in absence of the peak at zeroth harmonic in
spectra, spacial correlation functions decaying to zero level and strictly
Rayleigh PDFs for waves amplitudes. For the classical NLS equation (1) with
cnoidal wave initial condition PDFs turn out to be significantly different from
Rayleigh ones with 'fat tails' in the region of large amplitudes where higher
waves appear more frequently, while for generalized NLS equation with six-wave
interactions, dumping and pumping terms (3) we demonstrate absence of
non-Rayleigh addition to the PDFs for zeroth six-wave interactions coefficient
and increase of non-Rayleigh addition with six-wave interactions term.

are described to evolve on a predefined background cosmology, commonly taken as
the homogeneous-isotropic solutions of Einstein's field equations
(Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies). In order to make
physical sense, this background cosmology must provide a reasonable description
of the effective, i.e. spatially averaged, evolution of structure
inhomogeneities also in the nonlinear regime. Guided by the insights that (i)
the average over an inhomogeneous distribution of matter and geometry is in
general not given by a homogeneous solution of general relativity, and that
(ii) the class of FLRW cosmologies is not only locally but also globally
gravitationally unstable in relevant cases, we here develop a perturbation
approach that describes the evolution of inhomogeneities on a general
background being defined by the spatially averaged evolution equations. This
physical background interacts with the formation of structures. We derive and
discuss the resulting perturbation scheme for the matter model `irrotational
dust' in the Lagrangian picture, restricting our attention to scalar
perturbations.

to simulate heavy ion collisions in broad energy ranges. It consists of various
components to implement the different physical processes underlying the
transport approach. A major building block are the shared tables of constants,
implementing the baryon masses and widths. Unfortunately, many of these input
parameters are not well known experimentally. In view of the upcoming physics
program at FAIR, it is therefore of fundamental interest to explore the
stability of the model results when these parameters are varied. We perform a
systematic variation of particle masses and widths within the limits proposed
by the particle data group (or up to 10%). We find that the model results do
only weakly depend on the variation of these input parameters. Thus, we
conclude that the present implementation is stable with respect to the
modification of not yet well specified particle parameters.

systemic features exhibited by adaptive immune systems. The lymphocyte network
made by B-cells and T-cells is modeled by a bipartite spin-glass, where,
following biological prescriptions, links connecting B-cells and T-cells are
sparse. Interestingly, the dilution performed on links is shown to make the
system able to orchestrate parallel strategies to fight several pathogens at
the same time; this multitasking capability constitutes a remarkable, key
property of immune systems as multiple antigens are always present within the
host. We also define the stochastic process ruling the temporal evolution of
lymphocyte activity, and show its relaxation toward an equilibrium measure
allowing statistical mechanics investigations. Analytical results are compared
with Monte Carlo simulations and signal-to-noise outcomes showing overall
excellent agreement. Finally, within our model, a rationale for the
experimentally well-evidenced correlation between lymphocytosis and
autoimmunity is achieved; this sheds further light on the systemic features
exhibited by immune networks.

Therefore, you can always preserve the second law by default. Here, we
