The correct Weyl divergences, depending on the volume, surface area, and the

correct. Because there is no curvature, the finite part of the quantum energy
may be unambiguously extracted. Cubic, rectangular parallelepipedal, triangular

the energy in terms of geometric invariants for these different cavities is

suggest a possible way to connect the temperature dependence of its molar
excess entropy to that of its viscosity by constructing a macroscopic model,
where the deeply supercooled liquid is assumed to be a mixture of solid-like
and liquid-like micro regions. In this model, we assume that the mole fraction
x of the liquid-like micro regions tends to zero as the temperature T of the
liquid is decreased and extrapolated to a temperature Tg*, which we assume to
be below but close to the lowest glass transition temperature Tg attainable
with the slowest possible cooling rate for the liquid. Without referring to any
specific microscopic nature of the solid-like and liquid-like micro regions, we
also assume that near Tg, the molar enthalpy of the solid-like micro regions is
lower than that of the liquid-like micro regions. We then show that the
temperature dependence of x is directly related to that of the molar excess
entropy. Close to Tg, we assume that an activated motion of the solid-like
micro regions controls the viscosity and that this activated motion is a
collective motion involving practically all of the solid-like micro-regions so
that the molar activation free energy for the activated motion is proportional
to the mole fraction, 1-x, of the solid-like micro regions. The temperature
dependence of the viscosity is thus connected to that of the molar excess
entropy through the temperature dependence of the mole fraction x. As an
example, we apply our model to a class of glass formers for which the molar
excess entropy at temperatures near Tg is proportional to 1-T/TK with TK < Tg
\sim Tg* and find their viscosities to be well approximated by the
Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman equation for temperatures very close to Tg. We estimate
the values of three parameters in our model for three glass formers in this
class.

given by the cross-ambiguity function of the transmit pulse train and the pulse
train used in the receive filter, is essentially free of range sidelobes inside
a Doppler interval around the zero-Doppler axis. The transmit pulse train is
constructed by coordinating the transmission of a pair of Golay complementary
waveforms across time according to zeros and ones in a binary sequence P. The
pulse train used to filter the received signal is constructed in a similar way,
in terms of sequencing the Golay waveforms, but each waveform in the pulse
train is weighted by an element from another sequence Q. We show that a
spectrum jointly determined by P and Q sequences controls the size of the range
sidelobes of the cross-ambiguity function and by properly choosing P and Q we
can clear out the range sidelobes inside a Doppler interval around the zero-

analysis are in reality questions about this social space, raising the question
of inverting the process: Given a social network, how accurately can we
reconstruct the social structure of similarities and dissimilarities?
  We begin to address this problem formally. Observed social networks are
usually multiplex, in the sense that they reflect (dis)similarities in several
different ""categories,"" such as geographical proximity, kinship, or similarity
of professions/hobbies. We assume that each such category is characterized by a
latent metric capturing (dis)similarities in this category. Each category gives
rise to a separate social network: a random graph parameterized by this metric.
For a concrete model, we consider Kleinberg's small world model and some
variations thereof. The observed social network is the unlabeled union of these
graphs, i.e., the presence or absence of edges can be observed, but not their
origins. Our main result is an algorithm which reconstructs each metric with
provably low distortion.

model requires that the dissipated energy is small with respect to the
variation (work) of the conservative forces. The sample paths are sufficiently
smooth space-time tubes with suitable width allowing correct evaluation of

producing, e.g., radio emission of the magnetized planets and cool substellar
objects. Diagnosing the parameters of astrophysical radio sources requires
comprehensive nonlinear simulations of the radiation process. We simulate the
electron-cyclotron maser instability in a very low-beta plasma. The model used
takes into account the radiation escape from the source region and the particle
flow through this region. We developed a kinetic code to simulate the time
evolution of an electron distribution in a radio emission source. The model
includes the terms describing the particle injection to and escape from the
emission source region. The spatial escape of the emission from the source is
taken into account by using a finite amplification time. The unstable electron
distribution of the horseshoe type is considered. A number of simulations were
performed for different parameter sets typical of the magnetospheres of planets
and ultracool dwarfs. The generated emission (corresponding to the fundamental
extraordinary mode) has a frequency close to the electron cyclotron frequency
and propagates across the magnetic field. Shortly after the onset of a
simulation, the electron distribution reaches a quasi-stationary state. If the
emission source region is relatively small, the resulting electron distribution
is similar to that of the injected electrons; the emission intensity is low. In
larger sources, the electron distribution may become nearly flat due to the
wave-particle interaction, while the conversion efficiency of the particle
energy flux into waves reaches 10-20%. We found good agreement of our model
with the in situ observations in the source regions of auroral radio emissions
of the Earth and Saturn. The expected characteristics of the electron
distributions in the magnetospheres of ultracool dwarfs were obtained.

vector magnetogram using a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) model. NLFFF
extrapolation needs a considerable effort to be devoted for its numerical
realization. In this paper we present a new implementation of the
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)-relaxation method for NLFFF extrapolation. The
magneto-frictional approach which is introduced for speeding the relaxation of
the MHD system is novelly realized by the spacetime conservation-element and
solution-element (CESE) scheme. A magnetic field splitting method is used to
further improve the computational accuracy. The bottom boundary condition is
prescribed by changing the transverse field incrementally to match the
magnetogram, and all other artificial boundaries of the computational box are
simply fixed. We examine the code by two types of NLFFF benchmark tests, the
Low & Lou (1990) semi-analytic force-free solutions and a more realistic
solar-like case constructed by van Ballegooijen et al. (2007). The results show
that our implementation are successful and versatile for extrapolations of
either the relatively simple cases or the rather complex cases which need
significant rebuilding of the magnetic topology, e.g., a flux rope. We also
compute a suite of metrics to quantitatively analyze the results and
demonstrate that the performance of our code in extrapolation accuracy
basically reaches the same level of the present best-performing code, e.g.,
that developed by Wiegelmann (2004).

proceeds by approximating the actual Hamiltonian of the quantum system by a
quadratic function of its observables which corresponds to the Hamiltonian of a
quantum harmonic oscillator. This approximation is carried out in a mean square
optimal sense with respect to a Gaussian reference quantum state and leads to a
self-consistent linearization procedure where the mean vector and quantum
covariance matrix of the system observables evolve in time according to the
effective linear dynamics. We demonstrate the proposed Hamiltonian-based

properties of short-range resonating valence bond (RVB) wave functions using
Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) on kagome and square lattices on
(quasi-)infinite cylinders with generalized boundary conditions (and perimeters
with up to 20 lattice spacings). Making use of disconnected topological sectors
in the space of dimer lattice coverings, we explicitly derive (orthogonal)
""minimally entangled"" PEPS RVB states. For the kagome lattice, we obtain, using
the quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet as a reference model, the finite size
scaling of the energy separations between these states. In particular, we
extract two separate (vanishing) energy scales corresponding (i) to insert a
vison line between the two ends of the cylinder and (ii) to pull out and freeze
a spin at either end. We also investigate the relations between bulk and
boundary properties and show that, for a bipartition of the cylinder, the
boundary Hamiltonian defined on the edge can be written as a product of a
highly non-local projector with an emergent (local) su(2)-invariant
one-dimensional (superfluid) t--J Hamiltonian, which arises due to the symmetry
properties of the auxiliary spins at the edge. This multiplicative structure, a
consequence of the disconnected topological sectors in the space of dimer
lattice coverings, is characteristic of the topological nature of the states.
For minimally entangled RVB states, it is shown that the entanglement spectrum,
which reflects the properties of the edge modes, is a subset (half for kagome
RVB) of the spectrum of the local Hamiltonian, providing e.g. a simple argument
on the origin of the topological entanglement entropy S0=-ln 2 of Z2 spin
liquids. We propose to use these features to probe topological phases in
microscopic Hamiltonians and some results are compared to existing DMRG data.

account in the approximation of a cellular model of a gas-droplet suspension
whereby a suspension is viewed as a periodic structure consisting of the
identical spherical cells with periodic boundary conditions at the cell

the concentration of the soluble trace gas in a gaseous phase and in a droplet

shown that scavenging of highly soluble gases by cloud droplets leads to
essential decrease of soluble trace gas concentration in the interstitial air.
We found that scavenging coefficient for gas absorption by cloud droplets
remains constant and sharply decreases only at the final stage of absorption.
In the calculations we employed gamma size distribution of cloud droplets. It
was shown that despite of the comparable values of Henry's law constants for
the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and the nitric acid (HNO3), the nitric acid is
scavenged more effectively by cloud than the hydrogen peroxide due to a major

largely due to compelling advantages over traditional local applications. From
a user perspective, these include zero-maintenance of software, the always-on
nature of such services, mashups of different applications and the networking
effect with other users. Associated disadvantages are known, but effective
means and tools to limit their effect are not yet well-established and not yet
generally available to service users. We propose (1) a user-centric model of
cloud elements beyond the conventional <SPI>aaS layers, including activities
across trust zones, and (2) a personal control console for all individual and
collaborative user activities in the cloud.

local Universe. Remarkably, much of this size evolution appears to take place
in a short (1.8 Gyr) time span between z=2.2 and z=1.3, which poses a serious
challenge to hierarchical galaxy formation models where mergers occurring on a
similar timescale are the main mechanism for galaxy growth. We compute the
merger-driven redshift evolution of stellar mass Mstar\propto(1+z)^aM,
half-mass radius Re\propto(1+z)^aR and velocity-dispersion
sigma0\propto(1+z)^asigma predicted by concordance Lambda cold dark matter for
a typical massive ETG in the redshift range z=1.3-2.2. Neglecting dissipative
processes, and thus maximizing evolution in surface density, we find
-1.5<aM<-0.6, -1.9<aR<-0.7 and 0.06<asigma<0.22, under the assumption that the
accreted satellites are spheroids. It follows that the predicted z=2.2
progenitors of z=1.3 ETGs are significantly less compact (on average a factor
of 2 larger Re at given Mstar) than the quiescent galaxies observed at z>2.
Furthermore, we find that the scatter introduced in the size-mass correlation
by the predicted merger-driven growth is difficult to reconcile with the
tightness of the observed scaling law. We conclude that - barring unknown
systematics or selection biases in the current measurements - minor and major
mergers with spheroids are not sufficient to explain the observed size growth
of ETGs within the standard model.

  Problem","51 pages, 4 figures",,,,"math.CA math-ph math.DS math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We carry out a sequence of coordinate changes for the planar three-body
problem which successively eliminate the translation and rotation symmetries,
regularize all three double collision singularities and blow-up the triple
collision. Parametrizing the configurations by the three relative position
vectors maintains the symmetry among the masses and simplifies the
regularization of binary collisions. Using size and shape coordinates
facilitates the reduction by rotations and the blow-up of triple collision
while emphasizing the role of the shape sphere. By using homogeneous
coordinates to describe Hamiltonian systems whose configurations spaces are
spheres or projective spaces, we are able to take a modern, global approach to
these familiar problems. We also show how to obtain the reduced and regularized
differential equations in several convenient local coordinates systems.
