designing and evaluating such systems. The evaluation process uses the Equal
Error Rate (EER) metric proposed by the International Organization for
Standardization (ISO/IEC). The EER metric is a powerful metric which allows
easily comparing and evaluating biometric systems. However, the computation
time of the EER is, most of the time, very intensive. In this paper, we propose
a fast method which computes an approximated value of the EER. We illustrate
the benefit of the proposed method on two applications: the computing of non
parametric confidence intervals and the use of genetic algorithms to compute
the parameters of fusion functions. Experimental results show the superiority
of the proposed EER approximation method in term of computing time, and the
interest of its use to reduce the learning of parameters with genetic
algorithms. The proposed method opens new perspectives for the development of
secure multibiometrics systems by speeding up their computation time.

completed the sample with globular clusters of M31. We used a multivariate
statistical technique (K-Means clustering), together with a new algorithm (Gap
Statistics) for finding the optimum number of homogeneous sub-groups in the
sample, using a total of six parameters (absolute magnitude, effective radius,
virial mass-to-light ratio, stellar mass-to-light ratio and metallicity). We
found six groups. FK1 and FK5 are composed of high- and low-mass elliptical
galaxies respectively. FK3 and FK6 are composed of high-metallicity and
low-metallicity objects, respectively, and both include globular clusters and
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies. Two very small groups, FK2 and FK4, are composed
of Local Group dwarf spheroidals. Our groups differ in their mean masses and
virial mass-to-light ratios. The relations between these two parameters are
also different for the various groups. The probability density distributions of
metallicity for the four groups of galaxies is similar to that of the globular
clusters and UCDs. The brightest low-metallicity globular clusters and
ultra-compact dwarf galaxies tend to follow the mass-metallicity relation like
elliptical galaxies. The objects of FK3 are more metal-rich per unit effective
luminosity density than high-mass ellipticals.

0.09 and r_0 = 3.3 +0.3, -0.2 h^{-1} Mpc, reinforcing the understanding that
gas-rich galaxies represent the most weakly clustered galaxy population known;
we also observe a departure from a pure power law shape at intermediate scales,
as predicted in \Lambda CDM halo occupation distribution models. Furthermore,
we measure the bias parameter for the \alpha.40 galaxy sample and find that HI
galaxies are severely antibiased on small scales, but only weakly antibiased on
large scales. The robust measurement of the correlation function for gas-rich
galaxies obtained via the \alpha.40 sample constrains models of the
distribution of HI in simulated galaxies, and will be employed to better
understand the role of gas in environmentally-dependent galaxy evolution.

When the activity of the source is high, a physical phenomenon known as pileup

standard estimators of the source activities used so far in the field. We show
in this paper that the problem of counting rate estimation can be interpreted

no theoretical conditions can guarantee consistency in sparsity of LASSO,
because the dictionary is not ideal and the signal is sampled. We therefore
derive theoretical conditions and bounds which illustrate that the proposed

diffusion rate ($d\le 0.5$), the leading corrections-to-scaling term is found

to be $\sim t^{-0.5}$. After finding the strength of corrections to scaling,
effective exponents are systematically analyzed to conclude that the value of

should be compared with the critical decay exponent of the directed
percolation, 0.1595. In addition, we study two types of crossover. At $d=0$,
the phase boundary is discontinuous and the crossover from the pair contact
process to the PCPD is found to be described by the crossover exponent $\phi =
2.6(1)$. We claim that the discontinuity of the phase boundary cannot be

PCPD should belong to the DP. At $d=1$, the crossover from the mean field PCPD
to the PCPD is described by $\phi = 2$ which is argued to be exact.

be energetically dominant over the initial sub-second spike. In this paper we
develop an electromagnetic model of short GRBs that explains the two stages of
the energy release, the prompt spike and the prompt tail. The key ingredient of
the model is the recent discovery that an isolated black hole can keep its open
magnetic flux for times much longer than the collapse time and, thus, can
spin-down electromagnetically, driving the relativistic wind.
  First, the merger is preceded by an electromagnetic precursor wind. If a
fraction of the wind power is converted into pulsar-like coherent radio
emission, this may produce an observable radio burst of few milliseconds.
  At the active stage of the merger, two neutron stars produces a black hole
surrounded by an accretion torus in which the amplified magnetic field extracts
the rotational energy of the black hole and drives an axially-collimated
electromagnetic wind. For observers nearly aligned with the orbital normal this
is seen as a classical short GRB.
  After the accretion of the torus, the isolated black hole keeps the open
magnetic flux and drives the equatorially (not axially) collimated outflow,
which is seen by an observer at intermediate polar angles as a prompt tail. The
tail carries more energy than the prompt spike, but its emission is de-boosted
for observers along the orbital normal. Observers in the equatorial plane miss
the prompt spike and interpret the prompt tail as an energetic supernova-less
long GRB.
  We also demonstrate that episodic accretion onto the BH of magnetized clouds
that carry non-zero magnetic flux can be highly efficient in extracting the
spin energy of the BH, producing the outflows with the power exceeding the
average accretion power.

certain absolute continuity properties of the measure and its translation, we
recover the characterization on absolutely continuous measures $g\, dx$ with

particular representation of partition functions: a peculiar sum over all DV
phases in the first case and hiding the deformation parameters in a
sophisticated potential in the second case, i.e. essentially a reformulation of
some questions in the new theory in the language of the old one. It is at best
obscure if this treatment can be made consistent with the AGT relations and
even with the quantization of the underlying integrable systems in the
Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, which seem to require a full-scale beta-deformation
of individual DV partition functions. Thus, it is unclear if the story of
integrability is indeed closed by these recent considerations.

problems on social networks. We focus on sequential algorithms for which the
network topology is initially unknown and is revealed only within a local
neighborhood of vertices that have been irrevocably added to the output set.
The distinguishing feature of this setting is that locality is necessitated by
constraints on the network information visible to the algorithm, rather than
being desirable for reasons of efficiency or parallelizability. In this sense,
changes to the level of network visibility can have a significant impact on
algorithm design.
  We study a range of problems under this model of algorithms with local
information. We first consider the case in which the underlying graph is a
preferential attachment network. We show that one can find the node of maximum
degree in the network in a polylogarithmic number of steps, using an
opportunistic algorithm that repeatedly queries the visible node of maximum
degree. This addresses an open question of Bollob{\'a}s and Riordan. In
contrast, local information algorithms require a linear number of queries to
solve the problem on arbitrary networks.
  Motivated by problems faced by recruiters in online networks, we also
consider network coverage problems such as finding a minimum dominating set.
For this optimization problem we show that, if each node added to the output
set reveals sufficient information about the set's neighborhood, then it is
possible to design randomized algorithms for general networks that nearly match
the best approximations possible even with full access to the graph structure.
We show that this level of visibility is necessary.
  We conclude that a network provider's decision of how much structure to make
visible to its users can have a significant effect on a user's ability to
interact strategically with the network.

gains of cooperative approaches are well known, the combinatorial nature of
these schemes makes it difficult to design efficient polynomial-time algorithms
for joint routing, scheduling and power control. This becomes more so when
there is more than one flow in the network. It has been conjectured by many
authors, in the literature, that the multiflow problem in cooperative networks
is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we formulate the problem, as a
combinatorial optimization problem, for a general setting of $k$-flows, and
formally prove that the problem is not only NP-hard but it is
$o(n^{1/7-\epsilon})$ inapproxmiable. To our knowledge*, these results provide
the first such inapproxmiablity proof in the context of multiflow cooperative
wireless networks. We further prove that for a special case of k = 1 the
solution is a simple path, and devise a polynomial time algorithm for jointly
optimizing routing, scheduling and power control. We then use this algorithm to
establish analytical upper and lower bounds for the optimal performance for the
general case of $k$ flows. Furthermore, we propose a polynomial time heuristic
for calculating the solution for the general case and evaluate the performance
of this heuristic under different channel conditions and against the analytical
upper and lower bounds.

propagators (Green's functions) of particle pairs obtained from discontinuous
molecular dynamics simulations. At distances exceeding 3 molecular diameters,
the calculated pair diffusion coefficients are in excellent agreement with
predictions from exact macroscopic hydrodynamic theory for large Brownian
particles suspended in a solvent bath, as well as the Oseen approximation.
However, the asymptotic 1/r distance dependence of D(r) associated with
hydrodynamic effects emerges only after the pair distance dynamics has been
followed for relatively long times, indicating non-negligible memory effects in
the pair diffusion at short times. Deviations of the calculated D(r) from the
hydrodynamic models at short distances r reflect the underlying many-body fluid
structure, and are found to be correlated to differences in the local available
volume. The procedure used here to determine the pair diffusion coefficients
can also be used for single-particle diffusion in confinement with spherical
symmetry.

N V 1240, Si IV 1400, and C IV 1550 present weaker P-Cygni profiles (less
absorption) in the new data, while N IV 1718 absorption is deeper, without the
clear wind signature evident in the high state. Such changes contrast with
those found in other magnetic massive stars, where more absorption is observed
in the resonance doublets when the sightline is close to the plane of the
magnetic equator. The new data show also that the photospheric Fe IV forest, at
1600--1700 angstroms, has strengthened compared to previous observations. The
ultraviolet variability is large compared to that found in typical,
non-magnetic O stars, but moderate when compared to the high-/low-state changes
reported in the optical spectrum of HD 108 over several decades. We use non-LTE
expanding-atmosphere models to analyze the new STIS observations. Overall, the
results are in accord with a scenario in which the optical variability is
mainly produced by magnetically constrained gas, close to the photosphere. The
relatively modest changes found in the main ultraviolet wind lines suggest that
the stellar wind is not substantially variable on a global scale. Nonetheless,
multidimensional radiative-transfer models may be needed to understand some of
the phenomena observed.

visual representation of the network structure at each time step, the sequence

allow a human to interpret the temporal evolution of the network. In this
paper, we propose a framework for dynamic network visualization in the on-line
setting where only present and past graph snapshots are available to create the
present layout. The proposed framework creates regularized graph layouts by
augmenting the cost function of a static graph layout algorithm with a grouping
penalty, which discourages nodes from deviating too far from other nodes
belonging to the same group, and a temporal penalty, which discourages large
node movements between consecutive time steps. The penalties increase the
stability of the layout sequence, thus preserving the mental map. We introduce
two dynamic layout algorithms within the proposed framework, namely dynamic
multidimensional scaling (DMDS) and dynamic graph Laplacian layout (DGLL). We
apply these algorithms on several data sets to illustrate the importance of
both grouping and temporal regularization for producing interpretable
visualizations of dynamic networks.

a spectrum rich with ionized absorption lines from elements ranging from O to
Ni (Miller et al. 2006a, 2008; Kallman et al. 2009), indicative of an outflow
too dense and too ionized to be driven by radiation or thermal pressure. To
date, this spectrum is the only definitive evidence of an ionized wind driven
off the accretion disk by magnetic processes in a black hole X-ray binary. Here
we present our detailed spectral analysis of the first Chandra observation,
nearly three weeks earlier, in which the only signature of the wind is the Fe
XXVI absorption line. Comparing the broadband X-ray spectra via photoionization
models, we argue that the differences in the Chandra spectra cannot possibly be
explained by the changes in the ionizing spectrum, which implies that the
properties of the wind cannot be constant throughout the outburst. We explore
physical scenarios for the changes in the wind, which we suggest may begin as a
hybrid MHD/thermal wind, but evolves over the course of weeks into two distinct
outflows with different properties. We discuss the implications of our results
for the links between the state of the accretion flow and the presence of

thermodynamical evolution of the ordinary, baryonic matter. On one hand,
radiative emission drastically decreases the thermal energy content of the
interstellar plasma (ISM), inducing a slow cooling flow toward the centre. On
the other hand, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) struggles to prevent the
runaway cooling catastrophe, injecting huge amount of energy in the ISM. The
present study intends to deeply investigate the role of mechanical AGN feedback
in (isolated or massive) elliptical galaxies, extending and completing the mass
range of tested cosmic environments. Our previously successful feedback models,
in galaxy clusters and groups, demonstrated that AGN outflows, self-regulated
by cold gas accretion, are able to properly quench the cooling flow, without
destroying the cool core. Via 3D hydrodynamic simulations (FLASH 3.3),
including also stellar evolution, we show that massive mechanical AGN outflows
can indeed solve the cooling flow problem for the entire life of the galaxy, at
the same time reproducing typical observational features and constraints, such
as buoyant underdense bubbles, elliptical shock cocoons, sonic ripples,
dredge-up of metals, subsonic turbulence, and extended filamentary or nuclear
cold gas. In order to avoid overheating and totally emptying the isolated
galaxy, the frequent mechanical AGN feedback should be less powerful and
efficient (~1.e-4), compared to the heating required for more massive and bound
ellipticals surrounded by the intragroup medium (efficiency ~1.e-3).

Our results cover a large range of scales from ~0.5 to ~90 Mpc/h. We compare
these estimates with the expectations of the flat LCDM cosmological model with
parameters compatible with WMAP7 data. We use the MultiDark cosmological
simulation together with a simple halo abundance matching technique, to
estimate galaxy correlation functions, power spectra, abundance of subhaloes
and galaxy biases. We find that the LCDM model gives a reasonable description
to the observed correlation functions at z~0.5, which is a remarkably good
agreement considering that the model, once matched to the observed abundance of
BOSS galaxies, does not have any free parameters. However, we find a deviation
(>~10%) in the correlation functions for scales less than ~1 Mpc/h and ~10-40
Mpc/h. A more realistic abundance matching model and better statistics from
upcoming observations are needed to clarify the situation. We also estimate
that about 12% of the ""galaxies"" in the abundance-matched sample are satellites
inhabiting central haloes with mass M>~1e14 M_sun/h. Using the MultiDark
simulation we also study the real space halo bias b(r) of the matched catalogue
finding that b=2.00+/-0.07 at large scales, consistent with the one obtained
using the measured BOSS projected correlation function. Furthermore, the linear
large-scale bias depends on the number density n of the abundance-matched
sample as b=-0.048-(0.594+/-0.02)*log(n/(h/Mpc)^3). Extrapolating these results
to BAO scales we measure a scale-dependent damping of the acoustic signal

wavenumbers k>~0.1 h/Mpc in the linear large-scale bias.

0.05 < z < 0.55. We show that modifying the (g'-r'), m_r' and K-correction used

function of redshift (GDR = alpha * z + beta) with a best fit slope of alpha =
0.88 +/- 0.15 and normalization beta = 0.44 +/- 0.03. Contrary to claims of a
large intrinsic scatter, we find that the GDR data can be fully accounted for
using observational errors alone. Consistently, we find no evidence for a
correlation between GDR and cluster mass (via Tx or weak lensing). Lastly, the
data suggest that the evolution of the GDR at z < 0.2 is driven primarily by
dry merging of the massive giant galaxies, which when considered with previous

simultaneously produced both populations. We explore a general Kuiper belt
assembly model that forms hot classical KBOs interior to Neptune and delivers
them to the classical region, where the cold population forms in situ. First,
we present evidence that the cold population is confined to eccentricities well
below the limit dictated by long-term survival. Therefore Neptune must deliver
hot KBOs into the long-term survival region without excessively exciting the
eccentricities of the cold population. Imposing this constraint, we explore the
parameter space of Neptune's eccentricity and eccentricity damping, migration,
and apsidal precession. We rule out much of parameter space, except where
Neptune is scattered to a moderately eccentric orbit (e > 0.15) and
subsequently migrates a distance Delta aN=1-6 AU. Neptune's moderate
eccentricity must either damp quickly or be accompanied by fast apsidal
precession. We find that Neptune's high eccentricity alone does not generate a
chaotic sea in the classical region. Chaos can result from Neptune's
interactions with Uranus, exciting the cold KBOs and placing additional
constraints. Finally, we discuss how to interpret our constraints in the

important scatter in the number of bright satellites, even when the Aquarius

to show that (i) the BHB eccentricity growth found previously is a general
result, independent of the accretion and the adopted thermodynamics; (ii) the
semi-major axis decay depends both on the T_g and on the interplay with the
disc-binary L-transfer due to accretion; (iii) the spectral structure of the
T_g is predominately caused by disc edge overdensities and spiral arms
developing in the body of the disc and, in general, does not reflect directly
the period of the binary; (iv) the net T_g changes sign across the BHB
corotation radius. We quantify the relative importance of the two, which appear
to depend on the thermodynamical properties of the instreaming gas, and which
is crucial in assessing the disc-binary L-transfer; (v) the net torque
manifests as a purely kinematic (non-resonant) effect as it stems from the
cavity, where the material flows in and out in highly eccentric orbits. Both
accretion onto the black holes and the interaction with gas streams inside the
cavity must be taken into account to assess the fate of the BHB. Moreover, the
total torque exerted by the disc affects L(BHB) by changing all the elements

prescriptions equating tidal torque to semi-major axis shrinking might
therefore be poor approximations for real astrophysical systems.

systematically higher metallicities and younger stellar populations than the
discs. This correlation is consistent with a picture in which S0 formation
comprises the shutting down of star formation in the disc accompanied by a
final burst of star formation in the bulge. The variation in spatial-fit
parameters with wavelength also allows us to measure approximate colour
gradients in the individual components. Such gradients were detected separately
in both bulges and discs, in the sense that redder light is systematically more
centrally concentrated in all components. However, a search for radial
variations in the absorption line strengths determined for the individual
components revealed that they are absent from the vast majority of S0 discs and
bulges. The absence of gradients in line indices for most galaxies implies that
the colour gradient cannot be attributed to age or metallicity variations, and
is therefore most likely associated with varying degrees of obscuration by
dust.

the compactification to be the observed cosmological scale beyond which the
accelerated expansion starts. We derive the induced corrections to the Newton's
gravitational potential and we find that for distances smaller than the
S^1-radius the leading 1/r-term is corrected by convergent power series of
multipole form in the polar angle making explicit the induced anisotropy by the
compactified third dimension. On the other hand, for distances larger than the
compactification scale the asymptotic behavior of the potential exhibits a
logarithmic dependence with exponentially small corrections. The change of
Newton's force from 1/r^2 to 1/r behavior implies a weakening of the
deceleration for the expanding universe. Such topologies can also be created
locally by standard Newtonian axially symmetric mass distributions with
periodicity along the symmetry axis. In such cases we can use our results to
obtain measurable modifications of Newtonian orbits for small distances and
flat rotation spectra, for large distances at the galactic level.

lattice Boltzmann equation that rigorously maintains Galilean invariance of
forces to simulate inertial frame independent flow fields. In this regard, the
central moments, i.e. moments shifted by the local fluid velocity, of the
discrete source terms of the lattice Boltzmann equation are obtained by
matching those of the continuous full Boltzmann equation of various orders.
This results in an exact hierarchical identity between the central moments of
the source terms of a given order and the components of the central moments of
the distribution functions and sources of lower orders. The corresponding
source terms in velocity space are then obtained from an exact inverse
transformation due to a suitable choice of orthogonal basis for moments.
Furthermore, such a central moment based kinetic model is further extended by
incorporating reduced compressibility effects to represent incompressible flow.
Moreover, the description and simulation of fluid turbulence for full or any
subset of scales or their averaged behavior should remain independent of any
inertial frame of reference. Thus, based on the above formulation, a new
approach in lattice Boltzmann framework to incorporate turbulence models for
simulation of Galilean invariant statistical averaged or filtered turbulent
fluid motion is discussed.

derived. Two main elements are the local attractors in the collision term and
the source terms representing the effect of external and/or self-consistent
internal forces. For suitable choices of the orthogonal moment basis for the
three-dimensional, twenty seven velocity (D3Q27), and, its subset, fifteen
velocity (D3Q15) lattice models, attractors are expressed in terms of
factorization of lower order moments as suggested in an earlier work; the
corresponding source terms are specified to correctly influence lower order
hydrodynamic fields, while avoiding aliasing effects for higher order moments.
These are achieved by successively matching the corresponding continuous and
discrete central moments at various orders, with the final expressions written
in terms of raw moments via a transformation based on the binomial theorem.
Furthermore, to alleviate the discrete effects with the source terms, they are
treated to be temporally semi-implicit and second-order, with the implicitness
subsequently removed by means of a transformation. As a result, the approach is
frame-invariant by construction and its emergent dynamics describing fully 3D
fluid motion in the presence of force fields is Galilean invariant. Numerical
experiments for a set of benchmark problems demonstrate its accuracy.

fiber for beam transference. However, optical fibers induce nonlinear effects,
especially self-phase modulation (SPM). We studied SPM in our photonic crystal
fiber (PCF). SPM broadens the spectrum of a laser beam and decrease the
efficiency of bright laser guide star generation. We measured the spectrum
width using a spectrum analyzer. We found a spectrum width of 8.4 GHz at full
width at half maximum (FWHM). The original FWHM of our laser spectrum was 1.4
GHz. This was equivalent to a 70 % loss in laser energy. We also measured the
brightness of the sodium cell and evaluated its performance as a function of
laser wavelength. The cell's brightness showed a peculiar tendency;
specifically, it did not extinguish even though the wavelength varied by more
than 5 pm. To reduce the impact of SPM, we developed an optical system that
divides one laser pulse into four lower-power pulses. The laser peak power
after passing through the new optical system was decreased to one-fourth the
original, reducing the impact of SPM on the sodium cell. An actual laser guide
star created with the new system was 0.41 mag brighter than the laser guide

intermediate- and low-frequency peaked blazars suggests that gamma-gamma
absorption and pair cascading might occur in those objects. In previous papers,
we investigated the Compton emission from VHE gamma-ray induced pair cascades,
deflected by moderate magnetic fields, in a largely model-independent way, and
demonstrated that this emission can explain the Fermi fluxes and spectra of the
radio galaxies Cen A and NGC 1275. In this paper, we describe a generalization
of our Monte-Carlo cascade code to include the angle-dependent synchrotron
output from the cascades, allowing for the application to situations with
non-negligible magnetic fields, leading to potentially observable synchrotron
signatures, but still not dominating the radiative energy loss of cascade
particles. We confirm that the synchrotron radiation from the cascades in NGC
1275 and Cen A are negligible for the parameters used in our previous works. We
demonstrate that the magnetic field can not be determined from a fit of the
cascade emission to the gamma-ray spectrum alone, and the degeneracy can only
be lifted if the synchrotron emission from the cascades is observed as well. We
illustrate this fact with the example of NGC 1275. We point out that the

Extended abstract in RANDOM 2013",,,,"cs.IT cs.CC math.CO math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study certain combinatorial aspects of list-decoding, motivated by the
exponential gap between the known upper bound (of $O(1/\gamma)$) and lower
bound (of $\Omega_p(\log (1/\gamma))$) for the list-size needed to decode up to
radius $p$ with rate $\gamma$ away from capacity, i.e., $1-\h(p)-\gamma$ (here
$p\in (0,1/2)$ and $\gamma > 0$). Our main result is the following:
  We prove that in any binary code $C \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ of rate
$1-\h(p)-\gamma$, there must exist a set $\mathcal{L} \subset C$ of
$\Omega_p(1/\sqrt{\gamma})$ codewords such that the average distance of the
points in $\mathcal{L}$ from their centroid is at most $pn$. In other words,
there must exist $\Omega_p(1/\sqrt{\gamma})$ codewords with low ""average
radius."" The standard notion of list-decoding corresponds to working with the
maximum distance of a collection of codewords from a center instead of average
distance. The average-radius form is in itself quite natural and is implied by
the classical Johnson bound.
  The remaining results concern the standard notion of list-decoding, and help
clarify the combinatorial landscape of list-decoding:
  1. We give a short simple proof, over all fixed alphabets, of the
above-mentioned $\Omega_p(\log (\gamma))$ lower bound. Earlier, this bound
followed from a complicated, more general result of Blinovsky.
  2. We show that one {\em cannot} improve the $\Omega_p(\log (1/\gamma))$
lower bound via techniques based on identifying the zero-rate regime for list
decoding of constant-weight codes.
  3. We show a ""reverse connection"" showing that constant-weight codes for list
decoding imply general codes for list decoding with higher rate.
  4. We give simple second moment based proofs of tight (up to constant
factors) lower bounds on the list-size needed for list decoding random codes
and random linear codes from errors as well as erasures.

collision operators aiming to improve numerical stability. It achieves this and
distinguishes from other collision operators, such as in the standard single or
multiple relaxation time approaches, by performing relaxation process due to
collisions in terms of moments shifted by the local hydrodynamic fluid
velocity, i.e. central moments, in an ascending order-by-order at different
relaxation rates. In this paper, we propose and derive source terms in the
Cascaded-LBM to represent the effect of external or internal forces on the
dynamics of fluid motion. This is essentially achieved by matching the
continuous form of the central moments of the source or forcing terms with its
discrete version. Different forms of continuous central moments of sources,
including one that is obtained from a local Maxwellian, are considered in this
regard. As a result, the forcing terms obtained in this new formulation are
Galilean invariant by construction. The method of central moments along with
the associated orthogonal properties of the moment basis completely determines
the expressions for the source terms as a function of the force and macroscopic
velocity fields. In contrast to the existing forcing schemes, it is found that
they involve higher order terms in velocity space. It is shown that the
proposed approach implies ""generalization"" of both local equilibrium and source
terms in the usual lattice frame of reference, which depend on the ratio of the
relaxation times of moments of different orders. An analysis by means of the
Chapman-Enskog multiscale expansion shows that the Cascaded-LBM with forcing
terms is consistent with the Navier-Stokes equations. Computational experiments
with canonical problems involving different types of forces demonstrate its
accuracy.

challenges fundamental assumptions at the heart of continuum models of
population dynamics based on mean densities (local or global) only.
Individual-based models (IBM's) were introduced over the last decade in an
attempt to overcome this limitation by following explicitly each individual in
the population. Although the IBM approach has been quite insightful, the
capability to follow each individual usually comes at the expense of analytical
tractability, which limits the generality of the statements that can be made.
For the specific case of spatial structure in populations of sessile (and
identical) organisms, space-time point processes with local regulation seem to
cover the middle ground between analytical tractability and a higher degree of
biological realism. Continuum approximations of these stochastic processes
distill their fundamental properties, but they often result in infinite
hierarchies of moment equations. We use the principle of constrained maximum
entropy to derive a closure relationship for one such hierarchy truncated at
second order using normalization and the product densities of first and second
orders as constraints. The resulting `maxent' closure is similar to the
Kirkwood superposition approximation, but it is complemented with previously
unknown correction terms that depend on on the area for which third order
correlations are irreducible. This region also serves as a validation check,
since it can only be found if the assumptions of the closure are met.
Comparisons between simulations of the point process, alternative heuristic
closures, and the maxent closure show significant improvements in the ability
of the maxent closure to predict equilibrium values for mildly aggregated
spatial patterns.

significant angle ($i_B$) with respect to the binary disk plane. Our focus is
on the Lidov-Kozai mechanism and the evolution of planetesimal eccentricity and
inclination. Using both analytical and numerical methods, we find that, on one
hand, the disk gravity generally narrows down the Kozai-on region, i.e., the
Lidov-Kozai effect can be suppressed in certain parts of (or even the whole of)
the disk, depending on various parameters. In the Kozai-off region,
planetesimals would move on orbits close to the mid-plane of gas-disk, with the
relative angle ($i^{'}$) following a small amplitude periodical oscillation. On
the other hand, when we include the effects of disk gravity, we find that the
Lidov-Kozai effect can operate even at arbitrarily low inclinations ($i_B$),
although lower $i_B$ leads to a smaller Kozai-on region. Furthermore, in the
Kozai-on region, most planetesimals' eccentricities can be excited to extremely
high values ($\sim 1$), and such extreme high eccentricities usually accompany
orbital flipping, i.e., planetesimal orbit flips back and forth between
anterograde and retrograde. Once a planetesimal reaches very high orbital
eccentricity, gas drag damping will shrink the planetesimal orbit, forming a
""hot planetesimal"" on a near circular orbit very close to the primary star.
Such a mechanism, if replacing the planetesimals and gas drag damping with
Jupiters and tidal damping respectively, may lead to frequent production of
hot-Jupiters.

enforces such a notion of smoothness by requiring that temporal patterns belong
in low-dimensional Hilbert spaces V_l spanned by the leading l Laplace-Beltrami
eigenfunctions on M. These eigenfunctions can be evaluated efficiently in high
ambient-space dimensions using sparse graph-theoretic algorithms. Moreover,
they provide orthonormal bases to expand a family of linear maps, whose
singular value decomposition leads to sets of spatiotemporal patterns at
progressively finer resolution on the data manifold. The Riemannian measure of

navigation, but the biophysical mechanism of magnetoreception has remained
enigmatic. This paper presents a special biophysical model that consists of
magnetite-based and radical-pair-based mechanisms for avian magnetoreception.
The amplitude of the resultant magnetic field around the magnetic particles
corresponds to the geomagnetic field direction and affects the yield of
singlet/triplet state products in the radical-pair reactions. Therefore, in the
proposed model, the singlet/triplet state product yields are related to the
geomagnetic field information for orientational detection. The resultant
magnetic fields corresponding to two materials with different magnetic
properties were analyzed under different geomagnetic field directions. The
results showed that ferromagnetic particles in organisms can provide more
significant changes in singlet state products than superparamagnetic particles,
and the period of variation for the singlet state products with an included
angle in the geomagnetic field is approximately 180{\deg} when the magnetic
particles are ferromagnetic materials, consistent with the experimental results
obtained from avian magnetic compass. Further, the calculated results of the
singlet state products in a reception plane showed that the proposed model can
explain the avian magnetoreception mechanism with an inclination compass.

connected graphs embedded on a known surface of genus $g$. The algorithm
transports $O(g\log n)$ memory and finishes in time $O(g^2n^2)$, where $n$ is
the size of the graph. It requires access to a homology basis for the surface.
This algorithm, GFR, may be viewed as a suitable generalization of Face Routing
(FR), the well-known algorithm for plane graphs, which we previously showed
does {\it not} guarantee delivery in graphs embedded on positive genus
surfaces. The problem for such surfaces is the potential presence of
homologically non-trivial closed walks which may be traversed by the right-hand
rule. We use an interesting mathematical property of homology bases (proven in
Lemma \ref{lem:connectFaceBdr}) to show that such walks will not impede GFR. FR
is at the base of most routing algorithms used in modern (2D) ad hoc networks:
these algorithms all involve additional local techniques to deal with
edge-crossings so FR may be applied. GFR should be viewed in the same light, as
a base algorithm which could for example be tailored to sensor networks on
surfaces in 3D. Currently there are no known efficient local, logarithmic
memory algorithms for 3D ad hoc networks. From a theoretical point of view our
work suggests that the efficiency advantages from which FR benefits are related
to the codimension one nature of an embedded graph in a surface rather than the
flatness of that surface (planarity).

of a slave spin and an auxiliary fermion operator. For non-degenerate
multi-orbital models, our U(1) approach is advantageous in that it captures the
non-interacting limit at the mean-field level. For systems with either a single
orbital or degenerate multiple orbitals, the U(1) and $Z_2$ slave-spin
approachs yield the same results in the slave-spin-condensed phase. In general,
the U(1) slave-spin approach contains a U(1) gauge redundancy, and properly
describes a Mott insulating phase. We apply the U(1) slave-spin approach to
study the metal-to-insulator transition in a five-orbital model for parent iron
pnictides. We demonstrate a Mott transition as a function of the interactions
in this model. The nature of the Mott insulating state is influenced by the
interplay between the Hund's rule coupling and crystal field splittings. In the
metallic phase, when the Hund's rule coupling is beyond a threshold, there is a
crossover from a weakly correlated metal to a strongly correlated one, through
which the quasiparticle speactral weight rapidly drops. The existence of such a
strongly correlated metallic phase supports the incipient Mott picture of the
parent iron pnictides. In the parameter regime for this phase and in the
vicinity of the Mott transition, we find that an orbital selective Mott state
has nearly as competitive a ground state energy.

regular input-output transition systems (IOTSs) in which quiescence is
represented explicitly, via quiescent transitions. Four carefully crafted rules
on the use of quiescent transitions ensure that our QTSs naturally capture
quiescent behaviour.
  We present the building blocks for a comprehensive theory on QTSs supporting
parallel composition, action hiding and determinisation. In particular, we
prove that these operations preserve all the aforementioned rules.
Additionally, we provide a way to transform existing IOTSs into QTSs, allowing
even IOTSs as input that already contain some quiescent transitions. As an
important application, we show how our QTS framework simplifies the fundamental
model-based testing theory formalised around ioco.

Galactocentric distance of the Sun $R_0$ has been evaluated using all the

studies, our analysis of these results showed no statistically significant
trend in $R_0$ during this period. However we revealed a statistically valuable
improvement in the $R_0$ uncertainties with time of about 0.2 kpc for 20 years.
Several statistical techniques have been used and compared to obtain the most
reliable common mean of 52 determinations made in 1992--2011 and its realistic
uncertainty. The statistical methods used include unweighted mean, seven
variants of the weighted mean, and two variants of median technique. The $R_0$
estimates obtained with these methods range from 7.91 to 8.06 kpc with
uncertainties varying from 0.05 to 0.08 kpc. The final value derived in this
analysis is $R_0 = 7.98 \pm 0.15\,|_{stat} \pm 0.20\,|_{syst}$ kpc, which can
be recommended as the current best estimate of the Galactocentric distance of

have discovered two small-scale spiral structures lying within 0.5"" (~70AU). We
present models for the spiral structures using the spiral density wave theory,
and derive a disk aspect ratio of h~0.1, which is consistent with previous
sub-mm observations. This model can potentially give estimates of the
temperature and rotation profiles of the disk based on dynamical processes,
independently from sub-mm observations. It also predicts the evolution of the
spiral structures, which can be observable on timescales of 10-20 years,
providing conclusive tests of the model. While we cannot uniquely identify the
origin of these spirals, planets embedded in the disk may be capable of
exciting the observed morphology. Assuming that this is the case, we can make
predictions on the locations and, possibly, the masses of the unseen planets.

rate up to multigigabit/ sec, which makes analog-to-digital (ADC) become a key
bottleneck for the implementation of digital receivers due to its high
complexity and large power consumption. Therefore, monobit receivers for BPSK
have been proposed to address this problem. In this work, QPSK modulation is
considered for higher data rate. First, the optimal receiver based on monobit
ADC with Nyquist sampling is derived, and its corresponding performance in the
form of deflection ratio is calculated. Then a suboptimal but more practical
monobit receiver is obtained, along with iterative demodulation and small
sample removal. The effect of the imbalances between the In-phase (I) and
Quadrature-phase (Q) branches, including the amplitude and phase imbalances, is
carefully investigated too. To combat the performance loss caused by IQ
imbalances, monobit receivers based on double training sequences are proposed.
Numerical simulations show that the low-complexity suboptimal receiver suffers
only 3dB signal to noise ratio (SNR) loss in AWGN channels and 1dB SNR loss in
multipath static channels compared with the matched filter based monobit
receiver with full channel state information (CSI). The impact of the phase
difference between the transmitter and receiver is presented. It is observed
that the performance degradation caused by the amplitude imbalance is
negligible. Receivers based on double training sequences can efficiently
compensate the performance loss in AWGN channel. Thanks to the diversity
offered by the multipath, the effect of imbalances on monobit receivers in
fading channels is slight. I

using the infinite matrix product state representation, we calculate a
long-range string order. In the XY phase, the string correlations decay within
a relatively very large lattice distance, which makes a finite-size study
difficult to verify the non-existence of the string order. Thus, in the Haldane
phase, the non-vanishing string correlations in the limit of a very large
distance allow to characterize the phase boundaries to the XY phase and the
Neel phase, which implies that the transverse long-range string order is the
order parameter for the Haldane phase. In addition, the singular behaviors of
the von Neumann entropy and the fidelity per lattice site are shown to capture
clearly the phase transition points that are consistent with the results from
the string order. The estimated critical points including a BKT transition from
the XY phase to the Haldane phase agree well with the previous results:
$\Delta_{c2} = 0$ for the XY-Haldane phase transition and $\Delta_{c3} = 1.185$
for the Haldane-N'eel phase transition from the density renormalization group.
From a finite-entanglement scaling of the von Neumann entropy with respect to
the truncation dimension, the central charges are found to be $c \simeq 1.0$ at
$\Delta_{c2} = 0$ and $c \simeq 0.5$ at $\Delta_{c3} = 1.185$, respectively,
which shows that the XY-Haldane phase transition at $\Delta_{c2} = 0$ belongs
to the Heisenberg universality class, while the Haldane-Neel phase transition
at $\Delta_{c2} = 1.185$ belongs to the two-dimensional classical Ising
universality class. It is also shown that, the long-range order parameters and
the von Neumann entropy, as well as the fidelity per site approach, can be
applied to characterize quantum phase transitions as a universal phase
transition indicator for one-dimensional lattice many-body systems.

interplay between the span-wise vorticity and the planar divergent components.
For high Reynolds numbers the structure of the optimal perturbations in
Couette, Poiseuille, and mixing layer shear profiles is robust and resembles
localized plane-waves in regions where the background shear is large. The waves
are tilted with the shear when the span-wise vorticity and the planar
divergence fields are in (out of) phase when the background shear is positive
(negative). A minimal model is derived to explain how this configuration
enables simultaneous growth of the two fields, and how this mutual
amplification reflects on the optimal energy growth. This perspective provides
an understanding of the three dimensional growth solely from the two

degenerate nonlinear second order diffusion. The Hamiltonian of strain
G-equation is also non-convex. Numerical computation is performed based on
monotone discretization and weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO)
approximation of transformed G-equations on a fixed periodic domain. The
advection field in the computation is a two dimensional Hamiltonian flow
consisting of a periodic array of counter-rotating vortices, or cellular flows.
Depending on whether the evolution is predominantly in the hyperbolic or
parabolic regimes, suitable explicit and semi-implicit time stepping methods
are chosen. The turbulent flame speeds are computed as the linear growth rates
of large time solutions. A new nonlinear parabolic PDE is proposed for the
reinitialization of level set functions to prevent piling up of multiple
bundles of level sets on the periodic domain. We found that the turbulent flame
speed $s_T$ of the curvature G-equation is enhanced as the intensity $A$ of
cellular flows increases, at a rate between those of the inviscid and viscous
G-equations. The $s_T$ of the strain G-equation increases in small $A$,
decreases in larger $A$, then drops down to zero at a large enough but finite
value $A_{*}$. The flame front ceases to propagate at this critical intensity
$A_*$, and is quenched by the cellular flow.

mathematical theory of general artificial intelligence. This theory of
Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI) has made significant contributions to
many theoretical, philosophical, and practical AI questions. In a series of
papers culminating in book (Hutter, 2005), an exciting sound and complete
mathematical model for a super intelligent agent (AIXI) has been developed and
rigorously analyzed. While nowadays most AI researchers avoid discussing
intelligence, the award-winning PhD thesis (Legg, 2008) provided the
philosophical embedding and investigated the UAI-based universal measure of
rational intelligence, which is formal, objective and non-anthropocentric.
Recently, effective approximations of AIXI have been derived and experimentally
investigated in JAIR paper (Veness et al. 2011). This practical breakthrough
has resulted in some impressive applications, finally muting earlier critique
that UAI is only a theory. For the first time, without providing any domain
knowledge, the same agent is able to self-adapt to a diverse range of
interactive environments. For instance, AIXI is able to learn from scratch to
play TicTacToe, Pacman, Kuhn Poker, and other games by trial and error, without
even providing the rules of the games.
  These achievements give new hope that the grand goal of Artificial General
Intelligence is not elusive.
  This article provides an informal overview of UAI in context. It attempts to
gently introduce a very theoretical, formal, and mathematical subject, and
discusses philosophical and technical ingredients, traits of intelligence, some
social questions, and the past and future of UAI.

covering the last 120 years of its history. During the first 32 years the
system was in a quiescence state. Around the year 1922 the star's quiescence
luminosity brightened by 0.29 mag. The last 82 years of the light curve (LC)
are characterized by a series of outbursts of 1-2 magnitude in brightness and
about 100 days in duration. The outbursts are distributed along the time axis
in 6 clusters with a quasi-periodic cycle of some 5300 days. The time intervals
among the outbursts themselves are integral numbers of the period 373.5 days.
During quiescence states the LC oscillates with the binary period of the system
of 550 d. The LC contains also a weak periodic signal with a period of 350 d,
attributed to pulsations of the giant star. Another period of 1160 d is also
present in the light curve, being the sidereal rotation period of the giant
star. We suggest that the outbursts are events of intense mass transfer from
the giant onto the hot component. These are modulated by an interplay between a
solar-like magnetic dynamo cycle operating in the outer layers of the giant,
and a tidal deformation of these layers that circulates the surface of the
giant with the synodic diurnal period of 373.5 Earth days. AG Dra is the 5th
symbiotic system with a light curve that reflects such an intense magnetic and
magnetically modulated activity. (Abridged)

on the resampling stage. While standard multinomial and stratified resamplers
require a sum of importance weights computed collectively between threads, a
Metropolis resampler favourably requires only pair-wise ratios between weights,
computed independently by threads, and can be further tuned for performance by
adjusting its number of iterations. While achieving respectable results for the
stratified and multinomial resamplers, we demonstrate that a Metropolis
resampler can be faster where the variance in importance weights is modest, and
so is worth considering in a performance-critical context, such as particle
Markov chain Monte Carlo and real-time applications.

the application of PDF protocols. In this paper, we propose a PDF protocol and
MIMO precoder designs at the source and relay nodes. The precoder designs are
adapted based on statistical channel state information for correlated MIMO

occulted by the pulsating M-giant companion with two sources of the nebular
emission; one is an unocculted nebula of the M-giant's cool-wind origin and the
other is a partially occulted nebula associated to the WD. We confirmed our

as the performance measure, two source and channel coding schemes with power
adaptive transmission are presented. The first one is optimized for fixed rate
transmission, and hence enjoys simplicity of implementation. The second one is
a high performance scheme, which also benefits from optimized rate adaptation
with respect to source and channel states. In high SNR regime, the performance
scaling laws in terms of outage distortion exponent and asymptotic outage
distortion gain are derived, where two schemes with fixed transmission power
and adaptive or optimized fixed rates are considered as benchmarks for
comparisons. Various analytical and numerical results are provided which
demonstrate a superior performance for source and channel optimized rate and
power adaptive scheme. It is also observed that from a distortion outage
perspective, the fixed rate adaptive power scheme substantially outperforms an
adaptive rate fixed power scheme for delay-limited transmission of
quasi-stationary sources over wireless block fading channels. The effect of the
characteristics of the quasi-stationary source on performance, and the
implication of the results for transmission of stationary sources are also

natural fertility, but it remains a mystery what properties distinguish the
tens of cells which find an egg from the millions of cells ejaculated. To reach
the site of fertilization, sperm must traverse narrow and convoluted channels,
filled with viscous fluids. To elucidate individual and group behaviors that
may occur in the complex three-dimensional female tract environment, we examine
the behavior of migrating sperm in assorted micro-channel geometries. Cells
rarely swim in the central part of the channel cross-section, instead traveling
along the intersection of the channel walls (`channel corners'). When the
channel turns sharply, cells leave the corner, continuing ahead until hitting
the opposite wall of the channel, with a distribution of departure angles, the
latter being modulated by fluid viscosity. If the channel bend is smooth, cells
depart from the inner wall when the curvature radius is less than a threshold
value close to 150 micron. Specific wall shapes are able to preferentially
direct motile cells. As a consequence of swimming along the corners, the domain
occupied by cells becomes essentially 1-dimensional. This leads to frequent
collisions and needs to be accounted for when modeling the behavior of
populations of migratory cells and considering how sperm populate and navigate
the female tract. The combined effect of viscosity and three-dimensional
architecture should be accounted for in future in vitro studies of sperm
chemoattraction.

metric. We describe an approach in which GR becomes an SU(2) gauge theory. We
start at the linearised level and show how a gauge theoretic Lagrangian for
non-interacting massless spin two particles (gravitons) takes a much more
simple and compact form than in the standard metric description. Moreover, in
contrast to the GR situation, the gauge theory Lagrangian is convex. We then
proceed with a formulation of the full non-linear theory. The equivalence to
the metric-based GR holds only at the level of solutions of the field
equations, that is, on-shell. The gauge-theoretic approach also makes it clear
that GR is not the only interacting theory of massless spin two particles, in
spite of the GR uniqueness theorems available in the metric description. Thus,
there is an inifnite-parameter class of gravity theories all describing just
two propagating polarisations of the graviton. We describe how matter can be
coupled to gravity in this formulation and, in particular, how both the gravity
and Yang-Mills arise as sectors of a general diffeomorphism invariant gauge
theory. We finish by outlining a possible scenario of the UV completion of
quantum gravity within this approach.

Contrary to previous works, our model captures all phases of the prominence
formation, including the loss of thermal equilibrium, its successive growth in
height and width to macroscopic dimensions, and the gradual bending of the
arched loops into dipped loops, as a result of the mass accumulation. Our
2.5-dimensional, fully thermodynamically and magnetohydrodynamically consistent
model mimics the magnetic topology of normal-polarity prominences above a
photospheric neutral line, and results in a curtain-like prominence above the
neutral line through which the ultimately dipped magnetic field lines protrude
at a finite angle. The formation results from concentrated heating in the
chromosphere, followed by plasma evaporation and later rapid condensation in
the corona due to thermal instability, as verified by linear instability
criteria. Concentrated heating in the lower atmosphere evaporates plasma from
below to accumulate at the top of coronal loops and supply mass to the later
prominence constantly. This is the first evaporation-condensation model study
where we can demonstrate how the formed prominence stays in a force balanced
state, which can be compared to the Kippenhahn-Schluter type magnetohydrostatic
model, all in a finite low-beta corona.

structure that has been successfully hydrodynamically interpreted as a bow
shock and tail of ram-pressure-stripped material. Even the narrow tail,
initially difficult to model, has been understood as the effect of the passage
of Mira from a warm neutral medium into a hot, low-density medium, postulated
to be the Local Bubble. However, no model to date has explained the observed
kink and associated general curvature of the tail. We test the hypothesis that
before entering the Local Bubble, Mira was travelling through a shear flow with
approximately 1/3 Mira's own velocity at an angle of ~30degrees to Mira's
proper motion. The hypothesis reproduces the kinked nature of Mira's tail and
predicts recompression and reheating of the tail material to the same or
greater levels of density and temperature predicted in the shock. This provides
a heat source for the FUV emission, allowing for an extended lifetime of the
FUV emission in line with other estimates of the age of the tail. The
uniqueness of Mira's situation implies that the chances of observing other FUV
tails behind AGB stars is highly unlikely.

transiting exoplanets have now been discovered for which the mass, radius,
semi-major axis, host star metallicity and stellar effective temperature are
known. We use multivariate regression models to determine the dependence of
planetary radius on planetary equilibrium temperature T_eq, planetary mass M_p,
stellar metallicity [Fe/H], orbital semi-major axis a, and tidal heating rate
H_tidal, for 119 transiting planets in three distinct mass regimes. We
determine that heating leads to larger planet radii, as expected, increasing
mass leads to increased or decreased radii of low-mass (<0.5R_J) and high-mass
(>2.0R_J) planets, respectively (with no mass effect on Jupiter-mass planets),
and increased host-star metallicity leads to smaller planetary radii,
indicating a relationship between host-star metallicity and planet heavy
element content. For Saturn-mass planets, a good fit to the radii may be
obtained from log(R_p/R_J)=-0.077+0.450 log(M_p/M_J)-0.314[Fe/H]+0.671
log(a/AU)+0.398 log(T_eq/K). The radii of Jupiter-mass planets may be fit by
log(R_p/R_J)=-2.217+0.856 log(T_eq/K)+0.291 log(a/AU). High-mass planets' radii
are best fit by log(R_p/R_J)=-1.067+0.380 log(T_eq/K)-0.093
log(M_p/M_J)-0.057[Fe/H]+0.019 log(H_tidal/1x10^{20}). These equations produce
a very good fit to the observed radii, with a mean absolute difference between
fitted and observed radius of 0.11R_J. A clear distinction is seen between the

to a need for specialized methods for the analysis of digital gene expression
data. While gene expression data measured on a microarray take on continuous
values and can be modeled using the normal distribution, RNA sequencing data
involve nonnegative counts and are more appropriately modeled using a discrete
count distribution, such as the Poisson or the negative binomial. Consequently,
analytic tools that assume a Gaussian distribution (such as classification
methods based on linear discriminant analysis and clustering methods that use
Euclidean distance) may not perform as well for sequencing data as methods that
are based upon a more appropriate distribution. Here, we propose new approaches
for performing classification and clustering of observations on the basis of
sequencing data. Using a Poisson log linear model, we develop an analog of
diagonal linear discriminant analysis that is appropriate for sequencing data.
We also propose an approach for clustering sequencing data using a new
dissimilarity measure that is based upon the Poisson model. We demonstrate the
performances of these approaches in a simulation study, on three publicly
available RNA sequencing data sets, and on a publicly available chromatin
immunoprecipitation sequencing data set.

SEDs by using whatever pre-existing model SED libraries or their linear
combinations. The artificial neural networks (ANNs), principal component
analysis (PCA) and multimodal nested sampling (MultiNest) techniques are
employed to allow a highly efficient sampling of posterior distribution and the
calculation of Bayesian evidence. As a demonstration, we apply this tool to a
sample of hyperluminous infrared galaxies (HLIRGs). The Bayesian evidences
obtained for a pure Starburst, a pure AGN, and a linear combination of
Starburst+AGN models show that the Starburst+AGN model have the highest
evidence for all galaxies in this sample. The Bayesian evidences for the three
models and the estimated contributions of starburst and AGN to infrared
luminosity show that HLIRGs can be classified into two groups: one dominated by
starburst and the other dominated by AGN. Other parameters and corresponding
uncertainties about starburst and AGN are also estimated by using the model
with the highest Bayesian evidence. We found that the starburst region of the
HLIRGs dominated by starburst tends to be more compact and has a higher
fraction of OB star than that of HLIRGs dominated by AGN. Meanwhile, the AGN
torus of the HLIRGs dominated by AGN tend to be more dusty than that of HLIRGs
dominated by starburst. These results are consistent with previous researches,
but need to be tested further with larger samples. Overall, we believe that
BayeSED could be a reliable and efficient tool for exploring the nature of
complex systems such as dust-obscured starburst-AGN composite systems from
decoding their SEDs.

Ising universality class with symmetry breaking boundary conditions. We focus
on the effect of corrections to scaling and probe numerically the universality
of our results. In particular we check our hypothesis that corrections are well
described by an effective thickness L_{0,eff}=L_0+c (L_0+L_s)^{1-\omega} +L_s,
where c and L_s are system specific parameters and \omega\approx 0.8 is the
exponent of the leading bulk correction. We simulate the improved Blume-Capel
model and the Ising model on the simple cubic lattice. First we analyse the
behaviour of various quantities at the critical point. Taking into account
corrections \propto L_0^{-\omega} in the case of the Ising model, we find good
consistency of results obtained from these two different models. In particular
we get from the analysis of our data for the Ising model for the difference of
Casimir amplitudes \Delta_{+-}-\Delta_{++}=3.200(5), which nicely compares with
\Delta_{+-}-\Delta_{++}=3.208(5) obtained by studying the improved Blume-Capel
model. Next we study the behaviour of the thermodynamic Casimir force for large
values of the scaling variable x=t [L_0/\xi_0]. This behaviour can be obtained
up to an overall amplitude by expressing the partition function of the film in
terms of eigenvalues and eigenstates of the transfermatrix and boundary states.
Here we show how this overall amplitude can be computed with high accuracy.
Finally we discuss our results for the scaling functions \theta_{+-} and
\theta_{++} of the thermodynamic Casimir force for the whole range of the

fluid-solid interface is an active fundamental research area, motivated by its
potential for significant energy savings and reduced emissions in the transport
sector. Customarily, the performance of drag reduction techniques in internal
flows is evaluated under two alternative flow conditions, i.e. at constant mass
flow rate or constant pressure gradient. Successful control leads to reduction
of drag and pumping power within the former approach, whereas the latter leads
to an increase of the mass flow rate and pumping power. In practical
applications, however, money and time define the flow control challenge: a
compromise between the energy expenditure (money) and the corresponding
convenience (flow rate) achieved with that amount of energy has to be reached
so as to accomplish a goal which in general depends on the specific
application. Based on this idea, we derive two dimensionless parameters which
quantify the total energy consumption and the required time (convenience) for
transporting a given volume of fluid through a given duct. Performances of
existing drag reduction strategies as well as the influence of wall roughness
are re-evaluated within the present framework; how to achieve the
(application-dependent) optimum balance between energy consumption and
convenience is addressed. It is also shown that these considerations can be
extended to external flows.

gauge potential field which we determine quantum mechanically for two parallel

vacuum causes a cloud of virtual pairs. We calculate the virtual pair
production rate from quantum electrodynamics and estimate the virtual pair
cloud density, pair current and Lorentz force density acting on the field lines
via the pair cloud. These properties of field line dynamics become important in
collisionless reconnection, consistently explaining why and how reconnection
can spontaneously set on in the field-free centre of a current sheet below the

Aims. We present a detailed analysis of HD 150136 to confirm the triple nature
of this system. In addition, we investigate the physical properties of the
individual components of this system. Methods. We analysed high-resolution,
high signal-to-noise data collected through multi-epoch runs spread over ten
years. We applied a disentangling program to refine the radial velocities and
to obtain the individual spectra of each star. With the radial velocities, we
computed the orbital solution of the inner system, and we describe the main
properties of the orbit of the outer star such as the preliminary mass ratio,
the eccentricity, and the orbital-period range. With the individual spectra, we
determined the stellar parameters of each star by means of the CMFGEN
atmosphere code. Results. We offer clear evidence that HD 150136 is a triple
system composed of an O3V((f\ast))-3.5V((f+)), an O5.5-6V((f)), and an
O6.5-7V((f)) star. The three stars are between 0-3 Myr old. We derive dynamical
masses of about 64, 40, and 35 Msun for the primary, the secondary and the
third components by assuming an inclination of 49{\deg}. It currently
corresponds to one of the most massive systems in our galaxy. The third star
moves with a period in the range of 2950 to 5500 d on an outer orbit with an
eccentricity of at least 0.3. This discovery makes HD 150136 the first
confirmed triple system with an O3 primary star. However, because of the long
orbital period, our dataset is not sufficient to constrain the orbital solution
of the tertiary component with high accuracy.

properties of learning algorithms for multiclass classification problems. The
originality of our work is that we propose to use the confusion matrix of a
classifier as a measure of its quality; our contribution is in the line of work
which attempts to set up and study the statistical properties of new evaluation
measures such as, e.g. ROC curves. In the confusion-based learning framework we
propose, we claim that a targetted objective is to minimize the size of the
confusion matrix C, measured through its operator norm ||C||. We derive
generalization bounds on the (size of the) confusion matrix in an extended
framework of uniform stability, adapted to the case of matrix valued loss.
Pivotal to our study is a very recent matrix concentration inequality that
generalizes McDiarmid's inequality. As an illustration of the relevance of our
theoretical results, we show how two SVM learning procedures can be proved to
be confusion-friendly. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the
first that focuses on the confusion matrix from a theoretical point of view.

standard Analytical Mechanics, but still in fully classical terms, the behavior
of classical monochromatic wave beams in stationary media is shown to be ruled
by a dispersive ""Wave Potential"" function, encoded in the structure of the
Helmholtz equation. An exact, ray-based Hamiltonian description, revealing a
strong ray coupling due to the Wave Potential, and reducing to the geometrical
optics approximation when this function is neglected, is shown to hold even for
typically wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference. Recalling,
then, that the time-independent Schroedinger equation (associating the quantum
motion of mono-energetic particles with stationary monochromatic matter waves)
is itself a Helmholtz-like equation, the mathematical treatment holding in the
classical case is extended, without resorting to statistical concepts, to the
exact, trajectory-based, Hamiltonian quantum dynamics of point-like particles.
The particle trajectories and motion laws turn out to be coupled, in this case,
by a function strictly analogous to the Wave Potential and formally assuming
the familiar form of Bohm's ""Quantum Potential"", which is therefore not so much
a ""quantum"" as a ""wave"" property - in whose absence the quantum particle
dynamics reduces to the classical one. The time-independent Schroedinger
equation is argued to be not a trivial particular case of the time-dependent
one, but the exact quantum dynamical ground on which Schroedinger's
time-dependent statistical description (representing particles as travelling
wave-packets) is based. It provides indeed the (exact) link between classical
particle dynamics and Bohm's hydrodynamics.

the Hard X-ray Detector (34 ks) to obtain a 0.35-40 keV spectrum
simultaneously. Spectral characteristics suggest that the source was in the
X-ray quiescent state despite being in the rising phase of an outburst in the
optical band. The spectrum shows a clear signature of circumstellar absorption
in excess of interstellar absorption and the reprocessed emission features of
Fe fluorescence and Compton scattering. The extra absorption is explained due
to partial coverage by either neutral or ionized matter. We found a spectral
change during the observation, which is attributable only to the change in the
circumstellar absorption. Such an X-ray spectral variation is reported for the
first time in dwarf novae. We speculate that the variation in the circumstellar
absorption is interpreted as a time-varying disk wind or geometrically flaring
disk around the white dwarf during the propagation of a heat wave inward along
the accretion disk at the beginning of the outburst, in which optical outburst
and X-ray quiescent states co-exist.

  finding passive galaxies using SDSS-I/II and SDSS-III","Matches version accepted by MNRAS after minor corrections and

Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) up to z ~ 0.7 with the specific goal of
identifying and characterising a population of galaxies that has evolved
without significant merging. We compute a likelihood that each BOSS galaxy is a
progenitor of the Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) sample, targeted by SDSS-I/II up
z ~ 0.5, by using the fossil record of LRGs and their inferred star-formation
histories, metallicity histories and dust content. We determine merger rates,
luminosity growth rates and the evolution of the large-scale clustering between
the two surveys, and we investigate the effect of using different stellar
population synthesis models in our conclusions. We demonstrate that our sample
is slowly evolving (of the order of 2 +/- 1.5% per Gyr by merging). Our
conclusions refer to the bright and massive end of the galaxy population, with
Mi0.55 < -22, and M* > 1E11.2 Msolar, corresponding roughly to 95% and 40% of
the LRGs and BOSS galaxy populations, respectively. Our analysis further shows
that any possible excess of flux in BOSS galaxies, when compared to LRGs, from
potentially unresolved targets at z ~ 0.55 must be less than 1% in the
r0.55-band (approximately equivalent to the g-band in the rest-frame of
galaxies at z=0.55). When weighting the BOSS galaxies based on the predicted
properties of the LRGs, and restricting the analysis to the reddest BOSS
galaxies, we find an evolution of the large-scale clustering that is consistent
with dynamical passive evolution, assuming a standard cosmology. We conclude
that our likelihoods give a weighted sample that is as clean and as close to
passive evolution (in dynamical terms, i.e. no or negligible merging) as
possible, and that is optimal for cosmological studies.

sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy, but almost
independent of the incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter. By
identifying the lowest-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in giant flares
observed from soft gamma-ray repeaters as the fundamental torsional mode and
allowing for the dependence of the calculated frequency on stellar models, we
provide a lower limit of the density derivative of the symmetry energy as
$L\simeq 50$ MeV.

voting body on collective decisions a priori. Their nonlinearity and
discontinuity makes it difficult to compute inverse images, i.e., to determine
a voting system which induces a power distribution as close as possible to a
desired one. This paper considers approximations and exact solutions to this
inverse problem for the Penrose-Banzhaf index, which are obtained by
enumeration and integer linear programming techniques. They are compared to the
results of three simple solution heuristics. The heuristics perform well in
absolute terms but can be improved upon very considerably in relative terms.
The findings complement known asymptotic results for large voting bodies and
may improve termination criteria for local search algorithms.

coherent x-ray scattering in the far field from such disordered systems and
perform the angular cross-correlation analysis of calculated diffraction data.
The results of our simulations show the relation between the Fourier series
representation of the cross-correlation functions (CCFs) and different types of
correlations in disordered systems. The dependence of structural information
extracted by XCCA on the density of disordered systems and the degree of
orientational disorder of clusters is investigated. The statistical nature of
the fluctuations of the CCFs in the model `single-shot' experiments is
demonstrated and the potential of extracting structural information from the
analysis of CCFs averaged over a set of diffraction patterns is discussed. We
also demonstrate the effect of partial coherence of x-rays on the results of
XCCA.

Gunn g and r, and Johnson I filters. Two more transit events were observed
through a Gunn r filter. We detect a substantially larger planetary radius in

of gaseous planets. This phenomenon is most likely to be due to systematic
errors present in the u-band photometry, stemming from variations in the
transparency of Earth's atmosphere at these short wavelengths. We use our data

probabilities and observation probabilities. Finding powers of a matrix is done
by using the computationally efficient diagonalization method thereby reducing
the overall computational effort for evaluating the Evaluation problem of

found that evaluating matrix power by diagnolisation method is more suitable

we define and prove several properties of the metric $d_*$. Especially, $d_*$
satisfies a Kantorovich-Rubinstein type duality formula and can be
characterized by using disintegrations. In the second part, we characterize the

effects of anharmonicity on the steady-state thermal conductance of a mono and
diatomic molecular junctions. We also study molecules being confined in a
double-well potential. We find that when the molecules have a non-linear
on-site potential the low-temperature thermal conductance is dramatically
affected by the strength of non-linearity, whereas for the diatomic molecule
connected by an anharmonic spring the strength of anharmonicity plays almost no
role in the low-temperature regime. In case of the molecules confined in a
double-well potential we find that the height of the barrier greatly affects
the thermal conductance; once the molecules can feel the effect of the barrier
we observe negative differential thermal conductance at both high and low
temperatures.
