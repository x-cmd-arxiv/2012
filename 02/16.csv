interaction tuned by a Fano-Feshbach resonance, in the presence of mass and
density imbalance between the two species. By using many-body diagrammatic
methods, we first study the finite-temperature phase diagram for the specific
case of the mass-imbalanced mixture $^{87}$Rb $-^{40}$K for different values of
the density imbalance. We then analyse the quantum phase transition associated
with the disappearance at zero temperature of the boson condensate above a
critical boson-fermion coupling. We find a pronounced dependence of the
critical coupling on the mass ratio and a weak dependence on the density
imbalance. For a vanishingly small boson density, we derive, within our
approximation, the asymptotic expressions for the critical coupling in the
limits of small and large mass ratios. These expressions are relevant also for
the polaron-molecule transition in a Fermi mixture at small and large mass
ratios. The analysis of the momentum distribution functions at sufficiently
large density imbalances shows an interesting effect in the bosonic momentum
distribution due to the simultaneous presence of composite fermions and
unpaired fermions.

$\approx{}3\cdot{}10^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$ and a virial radius of $\approx{}$270
kpc. The simulations in a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology also include radiative
cooling, star formation, supernova feedback and the description of non-ideal
MHD. A primordial magnetic seed field ranging from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-34}$ G
in strength agglomerates together with the gas within filaments and
protohaloes. There, it is amplified within a couple of hundred million years up
to equipartition with the corresponding turbulent energy. The magnetic field
strength increases by turbulent small-scale dynamo action. The turbulence is
generated by the gravitational collapse and by supernova feedback.
Subsequently, a series of halo mergers leads to shock waves and amplification
processes magnetizing the surrounding gas within a few billion years. At first,
the magnetic energy grows on small scales and then self-organizes to larger
scales. Magnetic field strengths of $\approx{}10^{-6}$ G are reached in the
center of the halo and drop to $\approx{}10^{-9}$ G in the IGM. Analyzing the
saturation levels and growth rates, the model is able to describe the process
of magnetic amplification notably well and confirms the results of the

differences between coherent emission effects in different domains produce very
different results. Unified general treatment of the entire photon spectrum
makes basic physics intelligible to all. In the optical region the mean
distance between the scattering atoms is much longer than the photon wave
length, Dicke superradiant scattering is isotropic and multiple scattering,
Fano couplings are important and the lifetimes of intermediate stats are
sufficiently short to be negligible. In X-ray scattering the mean distance
between atoms is comparable to the photon wave length, Dicke superradiance is
concentrated in a forward peak, multiple scattering and Fano effects are

Using the PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), we
study transversely polarized p+p collisions. Results from PHENIX and other

due to contributions from both the Sivers and the Collins effects. Studying the

certain restrictions of first-order logic formulae. In contrast to Straubing's
model-theoretic approach, our notion of a logical fragment is purely syntactic

and standard stellar physics. The isotopic ratios such as ^{17,18}O and
^{25,26}Mg may require a refinement of modelling of supernova and asymptotic
giant branch stars. The recent observation of the Carbon-rich damped Lyman
\alpha system can be reproduced only with faint core-collapse supernovae. This
suggests that chemical enrichment by the first stars in the first galaxies is
driven not by pair-instability supernovae but by core-collapse supernovae (\sim
20-50M_\odot). The observed F abundances can be reproduced with the neutrino
processes of core-collapse supernovae. As in F, the observations of elemental
abundances in small systems may requires further complications of chemical
enrichment. In globular clusters the relative contribution from low-mass
supernovae is likely to be smaller than in the field, while the contribution
from massive supernovae seems smaller in dwarf spheroidal galaxies than in the

rough analogy to origami folding. Dark matter occupies a three-dimensional
'sheet' of free- fall observers, non-intersecting in six-dimensional
velocity-position phase space. At early times, the sheet was flat like an
origami sheet, i.e. velocities were essentially zero, but as time passes, the
sheet folds up to form cosmic structure. The present paper further illustrates
this analogy, and clarifies a Lagrangian definition of caustics and streams:
caustics are two-dimensional surfaces in this initial sheet along which it
folds, tessellating Lagrangian space into a set of three-dimensional regions,
i.e. streams. The main scientific result of the paper is that streams may be
colored by only two colors, with no two neighbouring streams (i.e. streams on
either side of a caustic surface) colored the same. The two colors correspond
to positive and negative parities of local Lagrangian volumes. This is a severe
restriction on the connectivity and therefore arrangement of streams in
Lagrangian space, since arbitrarily many colors can be necessary to color a
general arrangement of three-dimensional regions. This stream two-colorability
has consequences from graph theory, which we explain. Then, using N-body
simulations, we test how these caustics correspond in Lagrangian space to the
boundaries of haloes, filaments and walls. We also test how well outer caustics

order to optimize the track reconstruction and to fully exploit the data of
forthcoming directional detectors, we present a likelihood method dedicated to

drift axis. This opens the possibility to perform a fiducialization of
directional detectors. The angular resolution is shown to range between
20$^\circ$ to 80$^\circ$, depending on the recoil energy, which is however
enough to achieve a high significance discovery of Dark Matter. On the
contrary, we show that sense recognition capability of directional detectors
depends strongly on the recoil energy and the drift distance, with small
efficiency values (50%-70%). We suggest not to consider this information either
for exclusion or discovery of Dark Matter for recoils below 100 keV and then to

simultaneously models an organism's intrinsic movement behavior (e.g. Levy

the gradient flow, we find that only articles adopting the Hubble slowroll
expansion are on the right track, and a correct condition can be found in a
recent book by Liddle and Lyth. We further analyze this condition and show that
the gradient flow requirement is stronger than just asking for a slowly
changing, quasi-de Sitter solution. Therefore it is possible to have a
multifield slowroll model that does not follow the gradient flow. Consequently,
it no longer requires the gradient to be small. It even bypasses the first
slowroll condition and some related no-go theorems from string theory. We
provide the ""spiral inflation"" as a generic blueprint of such inflation model

Green's functions (NEGF) technique. The total current at one interface (the

inelastic scattering events occurring in the left lead. We show how this term
can be negligible or even vanish due to the pseudo-equilibrium statistical
properties of the lead in the thermodynamic limit. The expressions for the
different Green's functions needed for practical calculations of the current
are also provided. We determine the constraints imposed by the physical
condition of current conservation. The corresponding equation imposed on the
different self-energy quantities arising from the current conservation is
derived. We discuss in detail its physical interpretation and its relation with

photo-z's to BLAGN and QSOs based on their ALHAMBRA very-low-resolution
optical-NIR spectroscopy. A sample of 170 spectroscopically identified BLAGN
and QSOs have been used together with a library of templates (including SEDs
from AGN, normal, starburst galaxies and stars) in order to fit the 23
photometric data points provided by ALHAMBRA in the optical and NIR (20
medium-band optical filters plus the standard JHKs). We find that the ALHAMBRA
photometry is able to provide an accurate photo-z and spectral classification
for ~88% of the spectroscopic sources over 2.5 deg^2 in different areas of the
survey, all of them brighter than m678=23.5 (equivalent to r(SLOAN)~24.0). The
derived photo-z accuracy is better than 1% and comparable to the most recent
results in other cosmological fields. The fraction of outliers (~12%) is mainly
caused by the larger photometric errors for the faintest sources and the
intrinsic variability of the BLAGN/QSO population. A small fraction of outliers
may have an incorrectly assigned spectroscopic redshift. The definition of the
ALHAMBRA survey in terms of the number of filters, filter properties, area
coverage and depth is able to provide photometric redshifts for BLAGN/QSOs with
a precision similar to any previous survey that makes use of medium-band
optical photometry. In agreement with previous literature results, our analysis
also reveals that, in the 0<z<4 redshift interval, very accurate photo-z can be
obtained without the use of near-IR broadband photometry at the expense of a
slight increase of outliers. The NIR importance is expected to increase at
higher redshifts (z>4). These results are relevant for the design of future
optical follow-ups of surveys with a large fraction of BLAGN, as it is the case
for X-rays or radio surveys.

adding complex correlated noise adapted to a specified workload.
  Our main result is a novel lower bound on the minimum total error required to

was ""Secular Evolution of Galaxies"" and my task was to present the underlying

chemical evolution, so these topics are avoided here. We start with an account
of the connections between isolating integrals, quasiperiodicity and
angle-action variables - these variables played a unifying role throughout the
lectures. This leads on to the phenomenon of resonant trapping and how this can
lead to chaos in cuspy potentials and phase-space mixing in slowly evolving
potentials. Surfaces of section and frequency analysis are introduced as
diagnostics of phase-space structure. Real galactic potentials include a
fluctuating part that drives the system towards unattainable thermal
equilibrium. Two-body encounters are only one source of fluctuations, and all
fluctuations will drive similar evolution. We derive the orbit-averaged
Fokker-Planck equation and relations that hold between the second-order
diffusion coefficients and both the power spectrum of the fluctuations and the
first-order diffusion coefficients. From the observed heating of the solar
neighbourhood we show that the second-order diffusion coefficients must scale
as J^{1/2}. We show that periodic spiral structure shifts angular momentum
outwards, heating at the Lindblad resonances and mixing at corotation. The
equation that would yield the normal modes of a stellar disc is first derived
and then used to discuss the propagation of tightly-wound spiral waves. The
winding up of such waves is explains why cool stellar discs are responsive
systems that amplify ambient noise. An explanation is offered of why the
Lin-Shu-Kalnajs dispersion relation and even global normal-mode calculations
provide a very incomplete understanding of the dynamics of stellar discs.

this problem. We refer to this approach as precoding-based network alignment
(PBNA). Similar to the wireless setting, PBNA asymptotically achieves half the
minimum cut; different from the wireless setting, its feasibility depends on
the graph structure. Das et al. provided a set of feasibility conditions for
PBNA with respect to a particular precoding matrix. However, the set consisted
of an infinite number of conditions, which is impossible to check in practice.
Furthermore, the conditions were purely algebraic, without interpretation with
regards to the graph structure. In this paper, we first prove that the set of
conditions provided by Das. et al are also necessary for the feasibility of
PBNA with respect to any precoding matrix. Then, using two graph-related
properties and a degree-counting technique, we reduce the set to just four
conditions. This reduction enables an efficient algorithm for checking the

of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in these galaxies. We carry out a pilot spectral
synthesis study using a combination of both population and evolutionary
synthesis models. Their outputs are in qualitative agreement, strongly
suggesting a formation history dominated by starbursts. In agreement with the
presence of WR stars, these models show that these GPs currently undergo a
major starburst producing between ~4% and ~20% of their stellar mass. However,
as models imply, they are old galaxies having had formed most of their stellar
mass several Gyr ago. The presence of old stars has been spectroscopically
verified in one of the galaxies by the detection of Mg I 5167, 5173 absorption
line. Additionally, we perform a surface photometry study based on HST data,
that indicates that the three galaxies posses an exponential low-surface
brightness envelope. If due to stellar emission, the latter is structurally
compatible to the evolved hosts of luminous BCD/HII galaxies, suggesting that
GPs are identifiable with major episodes in the assembly history of local BCDs.
These conclusions highlight the importance of these objects as laboratories for

unique toric structure provided that $r,s\geq 2$. In contrast, the product $\bC
P^r \times \bC P^1$ can be given infinitely many distinct toric structures,
though only a finite number of these are compatible with each given symplectic

possible toric structures on a toric symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ with
$\dim H^2(M)=2$. In particular, all such manifolds are $\bC P^r$ bundles over
$\bC P^s$ for some $r,s$. We show that there is a unique toric structure if
$r<s$, and also that if $r,s\geq 2$ then $M$ has at most finitely many distinct
toric structures that are compatible with any symplectic structure on $M$.
Thus, in this case the finiteness result does not depend on fixing the
symplectic structure. We will also give other examples where $(M,\omega)$ has a
unique toric structure, such as the case where $(M,\omega)$ is monotone.

scattering from targets with size parameters 2*pi*aeff/lambda < 25 provided the

includes support for MPI, OpenMP, and the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL).
  DDSCAT 7.2 supports calculations for a variety of target geometries (e.g.,
ellipsoids, regular tetrahedra, rectangular solids, finite cylinders, hexagonal

IceCube limits on neutrino capture and annihilation in the Sun and how
potential future conflicts between IceCube constraints and direct detection or

telescope guiding precision by a factor of ~5-7, significantly reducing the
correlated systematics in the measured light curves. This results in the
detection of a secondary eclipse with depth of 0.181%\pm0.020% (9-{\sigma}) - a
significant improvement in WIRC's photometric precision and a demonstration of
the capability of Palomar/WIRC to produce high quality measurements of
exoplanetary atmospheres. Our measured eclipse depth cannot be explained by
model atmospheres with heat redistribution but favor a pure radiative
equilibrium case with no redistribution across the surface of the planet. Our
measurement also gives an eclipse phase center of 0.5045\pm0.0020,
corresponding to an ecos{\omega} of 0.0070\pm0.0032. This result is consistent
with a circular orbit, although it also suggests the planet's orbit might be
slightly eccentric. The possible non-zero eccentricity provides insight into
the tidal circularization process of the star-planet system, but also might
have been caused by a second low-mass planet in the system, as suggested by a
previous transit timing variation study. More secondary eclipse observations,

significantly as log[L*(z)]=0.45z+log[L*(z=0)]. This is the first time Ha has
been used to trace SF activity with a single homogeneous survey at z=0.4-2.23.
Overall, the evolution seen in Ha is in good agreement with the evolution seen
using inhomogeneous compilations of other tracers of star formation, such as
FIR and UV, jointly pointing towards the bulk of the evolution in the last 11
Gyrs being driven by a strong luminosity increase from z~0 to z~2.2. Our
uniform analysis reveals an Ha star formation history of the Universe which can
be simply parameterised by log(SFRD)=-2.1/(1+z) for z<2.23. Both the shape and
normalisation of the Ha star formation history are consistent with the
measurements of the stellar mass density growth, confirming that our Ha
analysis traces the bulk of the formation of stars in the Universe up to z~2.2.
Star formation activity since z~2.2 is responsible for ~95% of the total
stellar mass density observed locally today (with half being assembled between
z=1.2-2.2, and the rest since z<1.2).

shock breakouts from stars surrounded by thick winds. In such events the
interaction with the wind powers the observed luminosity, and predictions
include observable hard X-rays. Wind breakouts on timescales of a day or longer
are currently the most probable for detection. Here we study the signal that
follows such events. We start from the breakout of the radiation mediated
shock, finding that the breakout temperature can vary significantly from one
event to another ($10^4 - 5 \times 10^6$ K) due to possible deviation from
thermal equilibrium. In general, events with longer breakout pulse duration,
$t_{bo}$, are softer. We follow the observed radiation through the evolution of
the collisionless shock which forms after the breakout of the radiation
mediated shock. We restrict the study of the collisionless shock evolution to
cases where the breakout itself is in thermal equilibrium, peaking in
optical/UV. In these cases the post-breakout emission contains two spectral
components - soft (optical/UV) and hard (X-rays and possibly soft
$\gamma$-rays). Right after the breakout pulse X-rays are strongly suppressed,
and they carry only a small fraction of the total luminosity. The hard
component becomes harder and its luminosity rises quickly afterwards, gaining
dominance at $\sim 10-50 \,t_{bo}$. The ratio of the peak optical/UV to the
peak X-ray luminosity depends mostly on the breakout time. In terms of
prospects for X-ray and soft gamma-ray detections, it is best to observe
100-500 days after explosions with breakout timescales between a week and a
month.

Fundamental Plane can all be written as simple combinations of a and b because
the distribution of I is much broader than that of Sigma, and Sigma and I are
only weakly correlated. Why this should be so for galaxies is a fundamental
open question about the physics of early-type galaxy formation. If luminosity
evolution is differential, and Rs and Sigmas do not evolve, then this is just
an accident: Sigma and I must have been correlated in the past. On the other
hand, if the (lack of) correlation is similar to that at the present time, then
differential luminosity evolution must have been accompanied by structural
evolution. A model in which the luminosities of low-L galaxies evolve more
rapidly than do those of higher-L galaxies is able to produce the observed
decrease in a (by a factor of 2 at z~1) while having b decrease by only about
20 percent. In such a model, the Mdyn/L ratio is a steeper function of Mdyn at

conduction in the intracluster medium (ICM) of cool-core galaxy clusters. The
ICM is a high-beta, weakly collisional plasma in which the transport of
momentum and heat is aligned with the magnetic field. The anisotropy of heat
conduction, in particular, gives rise to instabilities that can access energy
stored in a temperature gradient of either sign. We focus on the heat-flux
buoyancy-driven instability (HBI), which feeds on the outwardly increasing
temperature profile of cluster cool cores. Our aim is to elucidate how the
global structure of a cluster impacts on the growth and morphology of the
linear HBI modes when in the presence of Braginskii viscosity, and ultimately
on the ability of the HBI to thermally insulate cores. We employ an idealised
quasi-global model, the plane-parallel atmosphere, which captures the essential
physics -- e.g. the global radial profile of the cluster -- while letting the
problem remain analytically tractable. Our main result is that the dominant HBI
modes are localised to the the innermost (~<20%) regions of cool cores. It is
then probable that, in the nonlinear regime, appreciable field-line insulation
will be similarly localised. Thus, while radio-mode feedback appears necessary
in the central few tens of kpc, heat conduction may be capable of offsetting
radiative losses throughout most of a cool core over a significant fraction of
the Hubble time. Finally, our linear solutions provide a convenient numerical
test for the nonlinear codes that tackle the saturation of such convective
instabilities in the presence of anisotropic transport.

photoionization, star formation, supernova II feedback, but exclude supernova
driven winds and AGN feedback. The simulated galaxies assemble in two phases,
with the initial growth dominated by compact (r<r_eff) in situ star formation
fueled by cold, low entropy gas streams resulting in a very similar mean
assembly redshift of z_{f,ins}~2.5 for the in situ stellar component in all
galaxies. The late growth is dominated by accretion of old stars formed in
subunits outside the main galaxy (r>r_eff) resulting in an assembly redshift of
z_{f,acc}~0.5-1.5 with much larger scatter. We find a positive correlation
between the fraction of accreted stars and the final mass of our galaxies. We
show that gravitational feedback strongly suppresses late star formation in
massive galaxies contributing to the observed galaxy color bimodality. The
accretion of stellar material is also responsible for the observed size growth
of early-type galaxies. In addition, we find that the dark matter fractions
within the stellar half-mass radii continuously increase towards lower redshift
from about f_DM~0.05 at z~3 to f_DM~0.1-0.3 at z=0. Furthermore, the
logarithmic slope of the total density profile is nearly isothermal at the
present-day (gamma'~1.9-2.2). Finally, the input of gravitational heating
lowers the central dark matter densities in the galaxies, with the effect being
smaller compared to simulations without supernova feedback.

plasma in which the transport of heat and momentum occurs primarily along

instabilities to be driven by temperature gradients of either sign, the
magnetothermal instability (MTI) in the outskirts of non-isothermal clusters
and the heat-flux buoyancy-driven instability (HBI) in their cooling cores. We
employ the Athena MHD code to investigate the nonlinear evolution of these
instabilities, self-consistently including the effects of anisotropic viscosity
(i.e. Braginskii pressure anisotropy), anisotropic conduction, and radiative
cooling. We highlight the importance of the microscale instabilities that
inevitably accompany and regulate the pressure anisotropies generated by the
HBI and MTI. We find that, in all but the innermost regions of cool-core
clusters, anisotropic viscosity significantly impairs the ability of the HBI to
reorient magnetic-field lines orthogonal to the temperature gradient. Thus,
while radio-mode feedback appears necessary in the central few tens of kpc,
conduction may be capable of offsetting radiative losses throughout most of a
cool core over a significant fraction of the Hubble time. Magnetically-aligned
cold filaments are then able to form by local thermal instability. Viscous
dissipation during the formation of a cold filament produces accompanying hot
filaments, which can be searched for in deep Chandra observations of nearby
cool-core clusters. In the case of the MTI, anisotropic viscosity maintains the
coherence of magnetic-field lines over larger distances than in the inviscid
case, providing a natural lower limit for the scale on which the field can
fluctuate freely. In the nonlinear state, the magnetic field exhibits a folded
structure in which the field-line curvature and field strength are
anti-correlated.

average PDS was also obtained in a common source-frame energy band to account
for the dependence of time profiles on energy. Previous results obtained on
BATSE GRBs with unknown redshift showed that the average spectrum in the
25-2000 keV band could be modelled with a power-law with a 5/3 index over
nearly two decades of frequency with a break at ~1 Hz. Depending on the
normalisation and on the subset of GRBs considered, our results show analogous
to steeper slopes (between 1.7 and 2.0) of the power-law. However, no clear
evidence for the break at ~1 Hz was found, although the softer energy band of
BAT compared with BATSE might account for that. We instead find a break at
lower frequency corresponding to a typical source rest frame characteristic
time of a few seconds. We furthermore find no significant differences between
observer and source rest frames. Notably, no distinctive PDS features are found
for GRBs with different intrinsic properties of the prompt emission either.
Finally, the average PDS of GRBs at higher redshifts shows possibly shallower
power-law indices than that of low-z GRBs. It is not clear whether this is due
to an evolution with z of the average PDS.

since they require little more than a procedure for rewiring edges. If a
rewiring procedure exists for generating new graphs with specified statistical
properties, then a Markov chain sampler can generate an ensemble of graphs with
prescribed characteristics. However, successive graphs in a Markov chain cannot
be used when one desires independent draws from the distribution of graphs; the
realizations are correlated. Consequently, one runs a Markov chain for N
iterations before accepting the realization as an independent sample. In this
work, we devise two methods for calculating N. They are both based on the
binary ""time-series"" denoting the occurrence/non-occurrence of edge (u, v)
between vertices u and v in the Markov chain of graphs generated by the
sampler. They differ in their underlying assumptions. We test them on the
generation of graphs with a prescribed joint degree distribution. We find the N
proportional |E|, where |E| is the number of edges in the graph. The two
methods are compared by sampling on real, sparse graphs with 10^3 - 10^4

contribution for each task receives some high reward, while all remaining
contributions receive an identical, lower reward irrespective of their actual
qualities. Suppose a mechanism designer (site owner) wishes to optimize an
objective that is some function of the number and qualities of received
contributions. When potential contributors are strategic agents, who decide
whether to contribute or not to selfishly maximize their own utilities, is such
a ""best contribution"" mechanism, M_B, adequate to implement an outcome that is
optimal for the mechanism designer?
  We first show that in settings where a contribution's value is determined
primarily by an agent's expertise, and agents only strategically choose whether
to contribute or not, contests can implement optimal outcomes: for any
reasonable objective, the rewards for the best and remaining contributions in
M_B can always be chosen so that the outcome in the unique symmetric
equilibrium of M_B maximizes the mechanism designer's utility. We also show how
the mechanism designer can learn these optimal rewards when she does not know
the parameters of the agents' utilities, as might be the case in practice. We
next consider settings where a contribution's value depends on both the
contributor's expertise as well as her effort, and agents endogenously choose
how much effort to exert in addition to deciding whether to contribute. Here,
we show that optimal outcomes can never be implemented by contests if the
system can rank the qualities of contributions perfectly. However, if there is
noise in the contributions' rankings, then the mechanism designer can again
induce agents to follow strategies that maximize his utility. Thus imperfect
rankings can actually help achieve implementability of optimal outcomes when
effort is endogenous and influences quality.

an ongoing challenge. In this Paper we consider a minimal model of
self-propelled particles with variable speed. Inspired by experimental data
from schooling fish, we introduce a power-law dependency of the speed of each
particle on the degree of polarization order in its neighborhood. We derive
analytically a coarse-grained continuous approximation for this model and find
that, while the variable speed rule does not change the details of the ordering
transition leading to collective motion, it induces an inverse power-law
correlation between the speed or the local polarization order and the local
density. Using numerical simulations, we verify the range of validity of this
continuous description and explore regimes beyond it. We discover, in
disordered states close to the transition, a phase-segregated regime where most
particles cluster into almost static groups surrounded by isolated high-speed
particles. We argue that the mechanism responsible for this regime could be
present in a wide range of collective motion dynamics.

explicitly compute the scattering amplitude off a helical molecular model of

scattering. For elastic scattering, we find that at least double scattering
events must take place for longitudinal polarization to arise. We predict
energy windows for strong polarization, determined by the energy dependences of

mechanism for polarization amplification is proposed, that increases the
polarization linearly with the number of helix turns, consistent with recent
experiments on DNA SAMs.

  Many multivariate functions encountered in practice vary primarily along a
few directions in the space of input parameters. When these directions
correspond with coordinate directions, one may apply global sensitivity
measures to determine the parameters with the greatest contribution to the
function's variability. However, these methods perform poorly when the
directions of variability are not aligned with the natural coordinates of the
input space. We present a method for detecting the directions of variability of
a function using evaluations of its derivative with respect to the input
parameters. We demonstrate how to exploit these directions to construct a
surrogate function that depends on fewer variables than the original function,
thus reducing the dimension of the original problem. We apply this procedure to
an exercise in uncertainty quantification using an elliptic PDE with a model
for the coefficients that depends on 250 independent parameters. The dimension
reduction procedure identifies a 5-dimensional subspace suitable for
constructing surrogates.

which move along with the structural relaxation, we employ the minimum local
density for each particle in a time window whose width is set along with the
structural relaxation time. Particles subject to free volumes correspond well
to the configuration rearranging region of dynamical heterogeneity. While the
correlation length for dynamical heterogeneity grows with temperature decrease,
no growth in the correlation length of heterogeneity in the minimum local
density distribution takes place. A comparison of these results with those of
normal mode analysis reveals that superpositions of lower-frequency soft modes
extending over the free volumes exhibit spatial correlation with the broken

facilitate the interactions between fragile regions represented by free
volumes, to induce dynamical correlations at a large scale.

paper and consider a practical power model, i.e., taking into account a
transmit independent power which is related to the number of active transmit
antennas. Under this setup, we propose a new optimization approach, in which
the transmit covariance is optimized under fixed active transmit antenna sets,
and then active transmit antenna selection (ATAS) is utilized. During the
transmit covariance optimization, we propose a globally optimal energy
efficient iterative water-filling scheme through solving a series of concave
fractional programs based on the block-coordinate ascent algorithm. After that,
ATAS is employed to determine the active transmit antenna set. Since activating
more transmit antennas can achieve higher sum-rate but at the cost of larger
transmit independent power consumption, there exists a tradeoff between the
sum-rate gain and the power consumption. Here ATAS can exploit the best
tradeoff and thus further improve the EE. Optimal exhaustive search and
low-complexity norm based ATAS schemes are developed. Through simulations, we
discuss the effect of different parameters on the EE of the MIMO-BC.

is to demonstrate technology for GW observation in space, DPF still has a
chance of detecting GW signals and performing astrophysical observations. With
an observable range up to 50 kpc, its main targets are GW signals from galactic
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) binaries. By using inspiral-merger-ringdown
phenomenological waveforms, we perform both pattern-averaged analysis and Monte
Carlo simulations including the effect of detector motion to find that the
masses and (effective) spins of the IMBHs could be determined with errors of a
few percent, should the signals be detected. Since GW signals from IMBH
binaries with masses above $10^4 M_\odot$ cannot be detected by ground-based
detectors, these objects can be unique sources for DPF. If the inspiral signal
of a $10^3M_\odot$ IMBH binary is detected with DPF, it can give alert to the
ringdown signal for the ground-based detectors $10^2$--$10^3$s before
coalescence. We also estimate the possible bound on the graviton Compton
wavelength from a possible IMBH binary in $\omega$ Centauri. We obtain a

  Downsizing of Spin Evolution","To appear in the ApJ, 11 pages and 9 figures",,"10.1088/0004-637X/749/2/187",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spin is an important but poorly constrained parameter for describing
supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Using the continuity equation of SMBH number
density, we explicitly obtain the mass-dependent cosmological evolution of the
radiative efficiency for accretion, which serves as a proxy for SMBH spin. Our
calculations make use of the SMBH mass function of active and inactive galaxies
(derived in the first paper of this series), the bolometric luminosity function
of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), corrected for the contribution from
Compton-thick sources, and the observed Eddington ratio distribution. We find
that the radiative efficiency generally increases with increasing black hole
mass at high redshifts (z>~1), roughly as \eta \propto M_bh^0.5, while the
trend reverses at lower redshifts, such that the highest efficiencies are
attained by the lowest mass black holes. Black holes with M_bh>~10^8.5M_sun
maintain radiative efficiencies as high as \eta~0.3-0.4 at high redshifts, near
the maximum for rapidly spinning systems, but their efficiencies drop
dramatically (by an order of magnitude) by z~0. The pattern for lower mass
holes is somewhat more complicated but qualitatively similar. Assuming that the
standard accretion disk model applies, we suggest that the accretion history of
SMBHs and their accompanying spins evolve in two distinct regimes: an early
phase of prolonged accretion, plausibly driven by major mergers, during which
the black hole spins up, then switching to a period of random, episodic
accretion, governed by minor mergers and internal secular processes, during
which the hole spins down. The transition epoch depends on mass, mirroring
other evidence for ""cosmic downsizing"" in the AGN population; it occurs at z~2
for high-mass black holes, and somewhat later, at z~1, for lower-mass systems.

557 supernova Ia data, the baryon acoustic oscillation results from the SDSS
DR7 and the cosmic microwave background radiation data from the WMAP7, we show
that the model gives the minimal $\chi^2_{min}=546.273$, which is comparable to
$\chi^2_{\Lambda{\rm CDM}}=544.616$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. The single
parameter $d$ concerned in the model is found to be $d=0.232\pm 0.006\pm
0.009$. Since the fractional density of dark energy $\Omega_{de}\sim d^2a^2$ at
$a \ll 1$, the fraction of dark energy is naturally negligible in the early
universe, $\Omega_{de} \ll 1$ at $a \ll 1$. The resulting constraints on the
present fractional energy density of matter and the equation of state are
$\Omega_{m0}=0.286^{+0.019}_{-0.018}^{+0.032}_{-0.028}$ and
$w_{de0}=-1.240^{+0.027}_{-0.027}^{+0.045}_{-0.044}$ respectively. The model
leads to a slightly larger fraction of matter comparing to the $\Lambda$CDM
model. We also provide a systematic analysis on the cosmic evolutions of the
fractional energy density of dark energy, the equation of state of dark energy,
the deceleration parameter and the statefinder. It is noticed that the equation
of state crosses from $w_{de}>-1$ to $w_{de}<-1$, the universe transits from
decelerated expansion ($q>0$) to accelerated expansion ($q<0$) recently, and
the statefinder may serve as a sensitive diagnostic to distinguish the CHDE
model with the $\Lambda$CDM model.

differs from the F5B algorithm in the insertion strategy on which the
F5-rewritten criterion is based. Exploring the potential ordering of
sig-polynomials computed by the original F5 algorithm, we propose an F5GEN

evolution from the beginning of the wall motion, the dominant,
oscillation-related term in the turbulent enstrophy is shown to cause the
turbulent dissipation to be enhanced in absolute terms, before the slow drift
towards the new quasi-equilibrium condition. This mechanism is found to be
responsible for the increase in mass flow rate. We finally show that the
time-average volume integral of the dominant term relates linearly to the drag
reduction.

In a previous paper we showed that semi-Markov processes are more appropriate

high order model should be used. In this work we introduce an indexed
semi-Markov process that is able to fit real data. We downloaded a database,

also present an extension of the logic to the modal mu-calculus, and an
axiomatization for the single-agent version of this logic. Examples and

feedback induce multiple firing coherence resonances at sufficiently strong
coupling strengths, thus giving rise to tongues of coherency in the
corresponding delay-strength parameter plane. If only inhibitory synapses are
used, however, appropriately tuned delays also give rise to multiresonant
responses, yet the successive delays warranting an optimal coherence of
excitations obey different relations with regards to the inherent time scales
of neuronal dynamics. This leads to denser coherence resonance patterns in the
delay-strength parameter plane. The robustness of these findings to the
introduction of delay in the excitatory feedback, to noise, and to the number
of coupled neurons is determined. Mechanisms underlying our observations are
revealed, and it is suggested that the regularity of spiking across neuronal

for understanding how the Sun affects the Earth's climate.
  Aims: Full-disk continuum images and magnetograms are now available for three
full solar cycles. We investigate how modelled TSI compares with direct
observations by building a consistent modelled TSI dataset. The model, based
only on changes in the photospheric magnetic flux can then be tested on
rotational, cyclical and secular timescales.
  Methods: We use Kitt Peak and SoHO/MDI continuum images and magnetograms in
the SATIRE-S model to reconstruct TSI over cycles 21-23. To maximise
independence from TSI composites, SORCE/TIM TSI data are used to fix the one
free parameter of the model. We compare and combine the separate data sources
for the model to estimate an uncertainty on the reconstruction and prevent any
additional free parameters entering the model.
  Results: The reconstruction supports the PMOD composite as being the best
historical record of TSI observations, although on timescales of the solar
rotation the IRMB composite provides somewhat better agreement. Further to
this, the model is able to account for 92% of TSI variations from 1978 to 2009
in the PMOD composite and over 96% during cycle 23. The reconstruction also
displays an inter-cycle, secular decline of 0.20 (+0.12 / -0.09) Wm-2 between
cycle 23 minima, in agreement with the PMOD composite.
  Conclusions: SATIRE-S is able to recreate TSI observations on all timescales
of a day and longer over 31 years from 1978. This is strong evidence that
changes in photospheric magnetic flux alone are responsible for almost all
solar irradiance variations over the last three solar cycles.

lattice results of the BMW, LHPC, PACS and HSC groups is achieved. From a
global fit we determine the axial coupling constants $F\simeq 0.45$ and $D
\simeq 0.80 $ in agreement with their values extracted from semi-leptonic
decays of the baryons. Moreover, various flavor symmetric limits of baron octet

the octet and decuplet ground states at different strange quark masses.

these systems is to obtain information about the equation of state of neutron
star matter via the measurement of the tidal polarizability parameters of
neutron stars. To extract this piece of information will require to have
accurate analytical descriptions of both the motion and the radiation of
tidally interacting binaries. We improve the analytical description of the late
inspiral dynamics by computing the next-to-next-to-leading order relativistic
correction to the tidal interaction energy. Our calculation is based on an
effective-action approach to tidal interactions, and on its transcription
within the effective-one-body formalism. We find that second-order relativistic
effects (quadratic in the relativistic gravitational potential $u=G(m_1
+m_2)/(c^2 r)$) significantly increase the effective tidal polarizability of
neutron stars by a distance-dependent amplification factor of the form $1 +
\alpha_1 \, u + \alpha_2 \, u^2 +...$ where, say for an equal-mass binary,
$\alpha_1=5/4=1.25$ (as previously known) and $\alpha_2=85/14\simeq6.07143$ (as

resumming them. We recommend to test our results by comparing

drawn from a suite of hydrodynamical simulations in which the IGM thermal state
and cosmological parameters are varied. From the wavelet analysis we obtain
estimates of the IGM thermal state that are in good agreement with other
recent, independent wavelet-based measurements. We also perform a reanalysis of
the same data set using the Lyman alpha forest flux probability distribution
function (PDF), which has previously been used to measure the IGM
temperature-density relation. This provides an important consistency test for
measurements of the IGM thermal state, as it enables a direct comparison of the
constraints obtained using these two different methodologies. We find the
constraints obtained from wavelets and the flux PDF are formally consistent
with each other, although in agreement with previous studies, the flux PDF
constraints favour an isothermal or inverted IGM temperature-density relation.
We also perform a joint analysis by combining our wavelet and flux PDF
measurements, constraining the IGM thermal state at z=2.1 to have a temperature
at mean density of T0/[10^3 K]=17.3 +/- 1.9 and a power-law temperature-density

ultraviolet, rather than trapped Ly$\alpha$ photons. This shell is itself

length is determined by measuring the visibility of quantum interferences in a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer as a function of temperature, in the quantum Hall
regime at filling factor two. The temperature dependence of the coherence
length can be varied by a factor of two. The strengthening of the phase
coherence at finite temperature is shown to arise from a reduction of the
coupling between co-propagating edge states. This opens the way for a strong
improvement of the phase coherence of Quantum Hall systems. The decoupling gate
also allows us to investigate how inter-edge state coupling influence the
quantum interferences' dependence on the injection bias. We find that the
finite bias visibility can be decomposed into two contributions: a Gaussian
envelop which is surprisingly insensitive to the coupling, and a beating
component which, on the contrary, is strongly affected by the coupling.

was designed as readout chip for future ATLAS Pixel Detectors and its first

benefits from its well understood design, which is kept as similar as possible
to the design of the current ATLAS Pixel Detector sensor. The second approach
of the new three dimensional (3D) silicon sensor technology benefits from the
shorter charge carrier drift distance to the electrodes, which completely
penetrate the sensor bulk. Prototype modules of both sensor concepts have been
build and tested in laboratory and test beam environment before and after
irradiation. Both concepts show very high performance even after irradiation to
5centerdot1015 1 MeV neqcm-2 and meet the IBL specifications in terms of hit
efficiency being larger than 97%. Lowest operational threshold studies have
been effected and prove independent of the used sensor concept the excellent

modeling. Our model describes the expansion of a SNR through a magnetized
interstellar medium (ISM), including the initial clumping of ejecta and the
effects on shock dynamics due to back-reaction of accelerated CRs. The model
predictions are compared to the observations of SN 1006. We found that the
back-reaction of accelerated CRs alone cannot reproduce the observed separation
between the forward shock (FS) and the contact discontinuity (CD) unless the
energy losses through CR acceleration and escape are very large and independent
of the obliquity angle. On the contrary, the clumping of ejecta can naturally
reproduce the observed small separation and the occurrence of protrusions
observed in SN 1006, even without the need of accelerated CRs. We conclude that
FS-CD separation is a probe of the ejecta structure at the time of explosion
rather than a probe of the efficiency of CR acceleration in young SNRs.

vs. \ (r-i)$ diagram is characterized by showing only minor $(g-r)$ variation
for the M dwarfs. The $(g-r) \ vs. \ (r-i)$ reddening vector has a slope almost
identical to the slope of the main sequence earlier than $\approx$M2, meaning
that dwarfs later than $\sim$M2 are not contaminated by reddened dwarfs of
earlier type. Chemical composition, stellar activity and evolution have only
minor effects on the location of the M2$-$M7 dwarfs in the $(g-r) \ vs. \
(r-i)$ diagram implying that reddening may be isolated in a rather unique way.
From $r$, $M_{r,(r-i)_0}$ and $E_{g-r}$ we may construct distance vs. $A_r$
diagrams. This purely photometric method is applied on SDSS DR8 data in the MBM
12 region. We derive individual stellar distances with a precision
$\approx20-26$%. For extinctions in the $r-band$ the estimate is better than
0.2 mag for $\approx 67%$ and between 0.3 and 0.4 for the remaining $\approx
33%$. The extinction discontinuities noticed in the distance vs. $A_r$ diagrams
suggest that MBM 12 is at $\approx$160 pc and MBM 16 at a somewhat smaller
distance $\approx$100 pc. The distance for which $\Delta (A_r)/\sigma
(\Delta(A_r))$ = 3, where $\Delta (A_r)$ refers to $\bar{A_{r, on}}-\bar{A_{r,
off}}$, may possibly be used as an indicator for the cloud distance as well:
For MBM 12 and 16 these distance estimates equal 160 and 100 pc, respectively

spatial and temporal resolution. Our intention is to model the coronal magnetic
field above active regions with the help of a nonlinear force-free
extrapolation code. Our code is based on an optimization principle and has been
tested extensively with semi-analytic and numeric equilibria and been applied
before to vector magnetograms from Hinode and ground based observations.
Recently we implemented a new version which takes measurement errors in
photospheric vector magnetograms into account. Photospheric field measurements
are often due to measurement errors and finite nonmagnetic forces inconsistent
as a boundary for a force-free field in the corona. In order to deal with these
uncertainties, we developed two improvements: 1.) Preprocessing of the surface
measurements in order to make them compatible with a force-free field 2.) The
new code keeps a balance between the force-free constraint and deviation from
the photospheric field measurements. Both methods contain free parameters,
which have to be optimized for use with data from SDO/HMI. Within this work we
describe the corresponding analysis method and evaluate the force-free
equilibria by means of how well force-freeness and solenoidal conditions are
fulfilled, the angle between magnetic field and electric current and by
comparing projections of magnetic field lines with coronal images from SDO/AIA.
We also compute the available free magnetic energy and discuss the potential
influence of control parameters.

H-mode plasmas and thus enable stationary H-mode. On the other hand in a future
device ELMs may cause divertor power flux densities far in excess of tolerable
material limits. The size of the energy loss per ELM is determined by
saturation effects in the non-linear phase of the ELM, which at present is
hardly understood. Solitary magnetic perturbations (SMPs) are identified as
dominant features in the radial magnetic fluctuations below 100kHz. They are
typically observed close (+-0.1ms) to the onset of pedestal erosion. SMPs are
field aligned structures rotating in the electron diamagnetic drift direction
with perpendicular velocities of about 10km/s. A comparison of perpendicular
velocities suggests that the perturbation evoking SMPs is located at or inside
the separatrix. Analysis of very pronounced examples showed that the number of
peaks per toroidal turn is 1 or 2, which is clearly lower than corresponding
numbers in linear stability calculations. In combination with strong peaking of
the magnetic signals this results in a solitary appearance resembling modes
like palm tree modes, edge snakes or outer modes. This behavior has been
quantified as solitariness and correlated to main plasma parameters. SMPs may
be considered as a signature of the non-linear ELM-phase originating at the
separatrix or further inside. Thus they provide a handle to investigate the
transition from linear to non-linear ELM phase. By comparison with data from
gas puff imaging processes in the non-linear phase at or inside the separatrix
and in the scrape-off-layer (SOL) can be correlated. A connection between the
passing of an SMP and the onset of radial filament propagation has been found.
Eventually the findings related to SMPs may contribute to a future quantitative
understanding of the non-linear ELM evolution.

give successful theoretical predictions for these processes, at successive
collider energies. The BSW model involves a combination of integrals that,
while computable numerically at fairly high energies, require some mathematical
analysis to reveal the high-energy asymptotic behavior. In this paper we
present a high-energy asymptotic representation of the scattering amplitude at
moderate momentum transfer, for the leading order in an expansion parameter
closely related to the logarithm of the center-of-mass energy. The fact that
the expansion parameter goes as the logarithm of the energy means that the
asymptotic behavior is accurate only for energies greatly beyond any
foreseeable experiment. However, we compare the asymptotic representation
against the numerically calculated model for energies in a less extreme region
of energy. The asymptotic representation is given by a simple formula which, in
particular, exhibits the oscillations of the differential cross section with
momentum transfer. We also compare the BSW asymptotic behavior with the
Singh-Roy unitarity upper bound for the diffraction peak.

network science during the last decade. A persistent problem with this approach
is the inherent uncertainty and noisy nature of the data. One of the cases in
which this situation is more marked is that of transcriptional regulatory
networks (TRNs) in bacteria. The datasets are incomplete because regulatory
pathways associated to a relevant fraction of bacterial genes remain unknown.
Furthermore, direction, strengths and signs of the links are sometimes unknown
or simply overlooked. Finally, the experimental approaches to infer the
regulations are highly heterogeneous, in a way that induces the appearance of
systematic experimental-topological correlations. And yet, the quality of the
available data increases constantly. In this work we capitalize on these
advances to point out the influence of data (in)completeness and quality on
some classical results on topological analysis of TRNs, specially regarding
modularity at different levels. In doing so, we identify the most relevant
factors affecting the validity of previous findings, highlighting important
caveats to future prokaryotic TRNs topological analysis.

steady states in networks of interacting species. A network is modeled as a
system of ordinary differential equations in which the form of the species
formation rate function is restricted by the reactions of the network and how
the species influence each reaction. We characterize families of so-called
power-law kinetics for which the associated species formation rate function is
injective within each stoichiometric class and thus the network cannot exhibit
multistationarity. The criterion for power-law kinetics is derived from the
determinant of the Jacobian of the species formation rate function. Using this
characterization we further derive similar determinant criteria applicable to
general sets of kinetics. The criteria are conceptually simple, computationally
tractable and easily implemented. Our approach embraces and extends previous
work on multistationarity, such as work in relation to chemical reaction
networks with dynamics defined by mass-action or non-catalytic kinetics, and
also work based on graphical analysis of the interaction graph associated to
the system. Further, we interpret the criteria in terms of circuits in the

a close-in exoplanet causes small but measurable variability in the cores of a
few lines in the spectra of several stars which corresponds to the orbital
period of the exoplanet. Stars with and without exoplanets may have different
properties. The main goal of our study is to search for influence which
exoplanets might have on atmospheres of their host stars. Unlike the previous
studies, we do not study changes in the spectrum of a host star or differences
between stars with and without exoplanets. We aim to study a large number of
stars with exoplanets, current level of their chromospheric activity and look
for a possible correlation with the exoplanetary properties. To analyse the
chromospheric activity of stars we exploit our own (2.2m ESO/MPG telescope) and
publicly available archival spectra (Keck Observatory Archive), measure the
equivalent widths of the cores of Ca II H and K lines and use them as a tracer
of their activity. Subsequently, we search for their dependence on the orbital
parameters and mass of the exoplanet. We found a statistically significant
evidence that the equivalent width of the Ca II K line emission and log R'_{HK}
activity parameter of the host star varies with the semi-major axis and mass of
the exoplanet. Stars with T_eff <= 5500 K having exoplanets with semi-major
axis a <= 0.15 AU (P_orb <= 20 days) have a broad range of Ca II K emissions
and much stronger emission in general than stars at similar temperatures but
with higher values of semi-major axes. Ca II K emission of cold stars (T_eff <=
5500 K) with close-in exoplanets (a <= 0.15 AU) is also more pronounced for
more massive exoplanets. The overall level of the chromospheric activity of
stars may be affected by their close-in exoplanets. Stars with massive close-in

thus we assume that the RAID consists of $N$ data drives and $M$ check drives.
The RAID fails only if the combined number of failed drives and sector errors
exceeds $M$, a property of Reed-Solomon codes.
  We review a number of models considered in the literature and build upon them
to construct models usable for a large number of data and check drives. We
attempt to account for a significant number of factors that affect RAID
reliability, such as drive replacement or lack thereof, mistakes during service
such as replacing the wrong drive, delayed repair, and the finite duration of
RAID reconstruction. We evaluate the impact of sector failures that do not
result in drive replacement.
  The reader who needs to consider large $M$ and $N$ will find applicable
mathematical techniques concisely summarized here, and should be able to apply
them to similar problems. Most methods are based on the theory of continuous
time Markov chains, but we move beyond this framework when we consider the
fixed time to rebuild broken hard drives, which we model using systems of delay
and partial differential equations.
  One universal statement is applicable across various models: increasing the
number of check drives in all cases increases the reliability of the system,
and is vastly superior to other approaches of ensuring reliability such as
mirroring.

the uniqueness problems are solved at once for all reference frames. We discuss
