some novel physical properties. We give the bulk-edge correspondence theory of
the star lattice and study the edge states and their topological orders in
different spin liquid phases. The bulk and edge-state energy structures and
Chern number depend on the spin liquid phases and hopping parameters because
the local spontaneous magnetic flux in the spin liquid phase breaks the time
reversal and space inversion symmetries. We give the characteristics of bulk
and edge energy structures and their corresponding Chern numbers in the
uniform, nematic and chiral spin liquids. In particular, we obtain analytically
the phase diagram of the topological orders for the chiral spin liquid states
SL[\phi,\phi,-2\phi], where \phi is the magnetic flux in two triangles and a
dodecagon in the unit cell. Moreover, we find the topological invariance for
the spin liquid phases, SL[\phi_{1},\phi_{2},-(\phi_{1}+\phi_{2})] and
SL[\phi_{2},\phi_{1},-(\phi_{1}+\phi_{2})]. The results reveal the relationship

galaxies in the local Universe clusters Coma, A1367, A779, and A634. The aim of
this work is to search for the imprint of the environment on the chemical
evolution of these galaxies. Galaxy chemical evolution is linked to the star
formation history (SFH), as well as to the gas interchange with the
environment, and low-mass galaxies are well known to be vulnerable systems to
environmental processes affecting both these parameters. For our study we have
used spectra from the SDSS-III DR8. We have examined the mass-metallicity
relation of cluster galaxies finding well defined sequences. The slope of these
sequences, for galaxies in low-mass clusters and galaxies at large
cluster-centric distances, follows the predictions of recent hydrodynamic
models. A flattening of this slope has been observed for galaxies located in
the core of the two more massive clusters of the sample, principally in Coma,
suggesting that the imprint of the cluster environment on the chemical
evolution of SF galaxies should be sensitive to both the galaxy mass and the
host cluster mass. The HI gas content of Coma and A1367 galaxies indicate that
low-mass SF galaxies, located at the core of these clusters, have been severely
affected by ram-pressure stripping. The observed mass-dependent enhancement of
the metal content of low-mass galaxies in dense environments seems plausible,
according to hydrodynamic simulations. This enhanced metal enrichment could be
produced by the combination of effects such as wind reaccretion, due to
pressure cofinement by the intra-cluster medium (ICM), and the truncation of
gas infall, as a result of the ram-pressure stripping. Thus, the properties of
the ICM should play an important role in the chemical evolution of low-mass
galaxies in clusters.

attempted solution to this paradox reveals a potential uncertainty in judging
the matter thus supporting the skeptical view of the problem. Moreover,
relating perception to intelligence, the same uncertainty is inherited by
judging the level of intelligence of an agent compared to others not
necessarily from the same kind (e.g. machine intelligence compared to human
intelligence). Using a proposed simple mathematical model for perception and

we show that for general MDPs the expected number of iterations is constant and

between the hidden and the ordinary sector is very weak, of the order of the
gravitational one. The approach to the vacuum energy problem presented here is
a quintessence like mechanism, in which it is assumed that the true vacuum
density energy is zero for some unknown reason, except for the contribution of
the light axion. As consequence of the weakness of this interaction, the hidden
Higgs is long lived and may act as a super heavy component of the dark matter
at present times.

describe the spatial distributions of the photospheric magnetic changes
associated with this flare, including the abrupt changes in the field vector,
vertical electric current and Lorentz force vector. We also trace these
parameters' temporal evolution. The abrupt magnetic changes were concentrated
near the neutral line and in two neighboring sunspots. Near the neutral line,
the field vectors became stronger and more horizontal during the flare and the
shear increased. This was due to an increase in strength of the horizontal
field components near the neutral line, most significant in the horizontal
component parallel to the neutral line but the perpendicular component also
increased in strength. The vertical component did not show a significant,
permanent overall change at the neutral line. The increase in total flux at the
neutral line was accompanied by a compensating flux decrease in the surrounding
volume. In the two sunspots near the neutral line the azimuthal flux abruptly
decreased during the flare but this change was permanent in only one of the
spots. There was a large, abrupt, downward vertical Lorentz force change during
the flare, consistent with results of past analyses and recent theoretical
work. The horizontal Lorentz force acted in opposite directions along each side
of neutral line, with the two sunspots at each end subject to abrupt torsional
forces. The shearing forces were consistent with field contraction and decrease
of shear near the neutral line, whereas the field itself became more sheared as
a result of the flux collapsing towards the neutral line from the surrounding
volume.

the work on successive standardization (or normalization) that is studied
earlier by the same authors in Olshen and Rajaratnam (2010) and Olshen and
Rajaratnam (2011). Thus, we deal with successive iterations applied to
rectangular arrays of numbers, where to avoid technical difficulties an array
has at least three rows and at least three columns. Without loss, an iteration
begins with operations on columns: first subtract the mean of each column; then
divide by its standard deviation. The iteration continues with the same two
operations done successively for rows. These four operations applied in
sequence completes one iteration. One then iterates again, and again, and
again,.... In Olshen and Rajaratnam (2010) it was argued that if arrays are
made up of real numbers, then the set for which convergence of these successive
iterations fails has Lebesgue measure 0. The limiting array has row and column
means 0, row and column standard deviations 1. A basic result on convergence
given in Olshen and Rajaratnam (2010) is true, though the argument in Olshen
and Rajaratnam (2010) is faulty. The result is stated in the form of a theorem
here, and the argument for the theorem is correct. Moreover, many graphics
given in Olshen and Rajaratnam (2010) suggest that but for a set of entries of
any array with Lebesgue measure 0, convergence is very rapid, eventually
exponentially fast in the number of iterations. Because we learned this set of
rules from Bradley Efron, we call it ""Efron's algorithm"". More importantly, the
rapidity of convergence is illustrated by numerical examples.

of each WD. For J1741, the star's radius must exceed 0.074 Rsun. For J2119, the
radius exceeds 0.10 Rsun. These indirect radius measurements are comparable to
the radius measurements for the bloated WD companions to A-stars found by the
Kepler spacecraft, and they constitute some of the largest radii inferred for
any WD. Surprisingly, J1741 also appears to show a 0.23 \pm 0.06% reflection
effect, and we discuss possible sources for this excess heating. Both J1741 and
J2119 are strong gravitational wave sources, and the time-of-minimum of the
ellipsoidal variations can be used to detect the orbital period decay. This may
be possible on a timescale of a decade or less.

1978K is associated with 1.3 x 10^{-3} Msun of silicate dust. We show that,
among several mechanisms, the shocked circumstellar dust is the most probable
emission source to explain the IR emission observed for CSM-rich SN 1978K. IR
emission from the other 5 objects is not detected. Our current observations are
sensitive to IR luminosity of > 10^{38} erg s^{-1}, and the non-detection of SN
1962M excludes the existence of the shocked circumstellar dust for a high gas

proposed for robust face recognition (FR). In SRC, the testing image is coded
as a sparse linear combination of the training samples, and the representation
fidelity is measured by the l2-norm or l1-norm of the coding residual. Such a
sparse coding model assumes that the coding residual follows Gaussian or
Laplacian distribution, which may not be effective enough to describe the
coding residual in practical FR systems. Meanwhile, the sparsity constraint on
the coding coefficients makes SRC's computational cost very high. In this
paper, we propose a new face coding model, namely regularized robust coding
(RRC), which could robustly regress a given signal with regularized regression
coefficients. By assuming that the coding residual and the coding coefficient
are respectively independent and identically distributed, the RRC seeks for a
maximum a posterior solution of the coding problem. An iteratively reweighted
regularized robust coding (IR3C) algorithm is proposed to solve the RRC model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on representative face databases demonstrate
that the RRC is much more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art sparse
representation based methods in dealing with face occlusion, corruption,
lighting and expression changes, etc.

consider the continuous-time quantum walk on the cycle with an additional link.
We find that the additional link in cycle indeed cause a very different
dynamical behavior compared to the dynamical behavior on the cycle. We
analytically treat this problem and calculate the Laplacian spectrum for the
first time, and approximate the eigenvalues and eigenstates using the Chebyshev
polynomial technique and perturbation theory. It is found that the probability
evolution exhibits a similar behavior like the cycle if the exciton starts far
away from the two ends of the added link. We explain this phenomenon by the
eigenstate of the largest eigenvalue. We prove symmetry of the long-time
averaged probabilities using the exact determinant equation for the eigenvalues
expressed by Chebyshev polynomials. In addition, there is a significant
localization when the exciton starts at one of the two ends of the extra link,
we show that the localized probability is determined by the largest eigenvalue
and there is a significant lower bound for it even in the limit of infinite
system. Finally, we study the problem of trapping and show the survival
probability also displays significant localization for some special values of
network parameters, and we determine the conditions for the emergence of such
localization. All our findings suggest that the different dynamics caused by
the extra link in cycle is mainly determined by the largest eigenvalue and its
corresponding eigenstate. We hope the Laplacian spectral analysis in this work
provides a deeper understanding for the dynamics of quantum walks on networks.

compression factors <0.9 and/or changes in viewing angles by >10 deg. An

  The core to our approach is to consider not only the Physical phenomena of

of sound, such as the human brain. In particular we derive the following three
fundamental phenomena of music:
  * the Major Scale,
  * the Standard Chord Dictionary, and
  * the difference in feeling between the Major and Minor Triads.
  While the Major Scale has been independently derived before by others in a
similar manner [Helmholtz1863, Birkhoff1933], I believe the derivation of the
Standard Chord Dictionary as well as the difference in feeling between the
Major and Minor Triads to be original.
  We show to be incomplete the theory of the heretofore agreed-upon authority
on this subject, 19th-century Physicist Hermann Helmholtz [Helmholtz1863]: he
says notes are in ""concord"" because the sound playing them together is ""less
worse"" than that of some other notes. But note that, in this theory, more notes
can only penalize, some merely less than others, and so the most harmonious
sound should be a single note by itself(!) and harmony would not exist as a
phenomenon of music at all.

During embryonic development of starfish and sea urchins, the position and the
developmental sequence of each arm are fixed, implying an auxological
anterior/posterior axis. Starfish also possess the Hox gene cluster, which
controls symmetrical development. Overall, echinoderms are thought to have a
bilateral developmental mechanism and process. In this article, we focused on
adult starfish behaviors to corroborate its bilateral tendency. We weighed
their central disk and each arm to measure the position of the center of
gravity. We then studied their turning-over behavior, crawling behavior and
fleeing behavior statistically to obtain the center of frequency of each
behavior. By joining the center of gravity and each center of frequency, we
obtained three behavioral symmetric planes. These behavioral bilateral
tendencies might be related to the A/P axis during the embryonic development of
the starfish. It is very likely that the adult starfish is, to some extent,
bilaterian because it displays some bilateral propensity and has a definite

allowing for a small parameter, which is meant to characterise the quantum loop

modelled the energy-dependent diffusion of cosmic-ray protons accelerated by

magnetic field values. We find that for considerably suppressed diffusion
coefficients (factors \chi=10^{-3} down to 10^{-5} the galactic average), low
energy cosmic-rays can be prevented from entering the inner core region. Such
an effect could lead to characteristic spectral behaviour in the GeV to TeV
gamma-ray and multi-keV X-ray fluxes across the core. These features may be
measurable with future gamma-ray and multi-keV telescopes offering arcminute or
better angular resolution, and can be a novel way to understand the level of

solution is necessary.
  We obtain the approximate solution and asymptotic solution of the turbulent
convection model in the overshooting region, and find some important properties
of the convective overshooting:
  I. The overshooting region can be partitioned into three parts: a thin region
just outside the convective boundary with high efficiency of turbulent heat
transfer, a power law dissipation region of turbulent kinetic energy in the
middle, and a thermal dissipation area with rapidly decreasing turbulent
kinetic energy. The decaying indices of the turbulent correlations $k$,
$\bar{u_{r}'T'}$, and $\bar{T'T'}$ are only determined by the parameters of the
TCM, and there is an equilibrium value of the anisotropic degree $\omega$.
  II. The overshooting length of the turbulent heat flux $\bar{u_{r}'T'}$ is
about $1H_k$($H_k=|\frac{dr}{dlnk}|$).
  III. The value of the turbulent kinetic energy at the convective boundary
$k_C$ can be estimated by a method called \textsl{the maximum of diffusion}.
Turbulent correlations in the overshooting region can be estimated by using
$k_C$ and exponentially decreasing functions with the decaying indices.

of two NBDs indeed explain the distribution data better at the highest
available LHC energy and in large interval of phase space. The two-NBD

distribution of the ""soft"" component of particle production in hadronic
collisions is valid at LHC also, as it is at RHIC and Tevatron. We analyze the

For homogeneous networks, there always exists a dominant nucleating cluster to
which relatively small clusters are attached gradually to form the critical
nucleus. For heterogeneous ones, many small isolated nucleating clusters emerge
at the early stage of the nucleation process, until suddenly they form the
critical nucleus through a sharp merging process. By analyzing the properties

believed to be triggered by tidal disruption of a star by a rapidly spinning
supermassive black hole (SMBH). For such events, the outer disk is very likely
misaligned with respect to the equatorial plane of the spinning SMBH, since the
incoming star before disruption most likely has an inclined orbital plane. The
tilted disk is subject to the Lense-Thirring torque, which tends to twist and
warp due to the Bardeen-Petterson effect. The inner disk tends to align with
the SMBH spin, while the outer region tends to remain in the stellar orbital
plane, with a transition zone around the Bardeen-Petterson radius. The
relativistic jet launched from the spinning SMBH would undergo precession. The
5-30 day X-ray lightcurve of Sw J1644+57 shows a quasi-periodic (2.7-day)
variation with noticeable narrow dips. We numerically solve a warped disk and
propose a jet-precessing model by invoking a Blandford-Znajek jet collimated by
a wind launched near the Bardeen-Petterson radius. Through simulations, we show
that the narrow dips in the X-ray lightcurve can be reproduced for a range of
geometric configurations. From data we infer that the inclination angle of the
initial stellar orbit is in the range of $10^{\circ}-20^{\circ}$ from the SMBH
equatorial plane, that the jet should have a moderately high Lorentz factor,
and that the inclination angle, jet opening angle, and observer's viewing angle
are such that the duty cycle of the line-of-sight sweeping the jet cone is
somewhat less than 0.5.

In the current study we show and discuss the evolution of broad-band radio
spectra, which are measured at ten frequencies between 2.64 and 142 GHz using
the Effelsberg 100-m and the IRAM 30-m telescopes. It is shown that any of the
78 sources studied can be classified in terms of their variability
characteristics in merely 5 types of variability. It is argued that these can
be attributed to only two classes of variability mechanisms. The first four
types are dominated by spectral evolution and can be described by a simple
two-component system composed of: (a) a steep quiescent spectral component from
a large scale jet and (b) a time evolving flare component following the
""Shock-in-Jet"" evolutionary path. The fifth type is characterised by an
achromatic change of the broad band spectrum, which could be attributed to a
different mechanism, likely involving differential Doppler boosting caused by
geometrical effects. Here we present the classification, the assumed physical
scenario and the results of calculations that have been performed for the
spectral evolution of flares.

occurrence of a centrifugal instability near the oscillating boundary, leading
to the so-called Taylor-G\""ortler vortices. A viscous stability criterion is
derived and compared to numerical results obtained for various libration
frequencies and Ekman numbers. The strongly nonlinear regime well above the

spontaneous generation of inertial waves in the bulk could exist when the
sidewall boundary layer becomes turbulent. Then, we analyse the librating flow
below the instability threshold and characterize the mean zonal flow correction
induced by the nonlinear interaction of the boundary layer flow with itself. In
the frequency regime where inertial modes are not excited, we show that the
mean flow correction in the bulk is a uniform rotation, independent of the
Ekman number and cylinder aspect ratio, in perfect agreement with the
analytical results of Wang [J. Fluid. Mech., 41, pp. 581 - 592, 1970]. When
inertial modes are resonantly excited, the mean flow correction is found to

from both intrinsic and cascade emissions produced by blazars using a simple
semi- analysis method for two models of the blazar gamma-ray luminosity
function (GLF). For the cascade emission, we consider two possible
contributions: one is due to that the flux of the cascade emission is lower
than the Fermi LAT sensitivity (case I), which is independent on the
extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF), another is due to the fact that the flux
of the cascade emission is larger than the Fermi LAT sensitivity but the
emission angle is larger than LAT point-spread-function (PSF) angle (case II),
which depends on the EGMF. Our results indicate that (1) blazar contribution to
the EGRB is dominant although it depends on the GLF model and the EGMF; (2) the
EGMF plays an important role in estimating the contribution from the cascade
emission produced by blazars, the contribution from the cascade emission will
significantly alter the EGRB spectrum when the strength of the EGMF is large
enough (say BEGMF > 10-12 G); and (3) since the cascade emission in case II
reaches a saturation when the strength of the EGMF is ? 10-11 G, it is very
possible that the contribution from the cascade emission produced by blazars
can be considered as another method to probe the upper limit of the strength of
the EGMF.

immune functions. Their ability to adapt to varying pathogens makes such
systems a suitable choice for various robotic applications. Generally,
AIS-based robotic applications map local instantaneous sensory information into
either an antigen or a co-stimulatory signal, according to the choice of
representation schema. Algorithms then use relevant immune functions to output
either evolved antibodies or maturity of dendritic cells, in terms of actuation
signals. It is observed that researchers, in an attempt to solve the problem in
hand, do not try to replicate the biological immunity but select necessary
immune functions instead, resulting in an ad-hoc manner these applications are
reported. Authors, therefore, present a comprehensive review of immuno-inspired
robotic applications in an attempt to categorize them according to underlying
immune definitions. Implementation details are tabulated in terms of
corresponding mathematical expressions and their representation schema that
include binary, real or hybrid data. Limitations of reported applications are
also identified in light of modern immunological interpretations. As a result
of this study, authors suggest a renewed focus on innate immunity and also
emphasize that immunological representations should benefit from robot
embodiment and must be extended to include modern trends.

quasi-periodic solutions which are resonant with the frequency vector of the
perturbation. We assume that the unperturbed system is locally integrable and
anisochronous, and that the frequency vector of the perturbation satisfies the
Bryuno condition. Existence of resonant solutions is related to the zeroes of a
suitable function, called the Melnikov function - by analogy with the periodic
case. We show that, if the Melnikov function has a zero of odd order and under
some further condition on the sign of the perturbation parameter, then there
exists at least one resonant solution which continues an unperturbed solution.
If the Melnikov function is identically zero then one can push perturbation
theory up to the order where a counterpart of Melnikov function appears and
does not vanish identically: if such a function has a zero of odd order and a
suitable positiveness condition is met, again the same persistence result is
obtained. If the system is Hamiltonian, then the procedure can be indefinitely
iterated and no positiveness condition must be required: as a byproduct, the
result follows that at least one resonant quasi-periodic solution always exists
with no assumption on the perturbation. Such a solution can be interpreted as a
(parabolic) lower-dimensional torus.

parametric studies of the unstable solutions. We find that in the
incompressible case the KHI is present for any velocity shear regardless the
value of the collision frequency. In the compressible case, the domain of
instability depends strongly on the plasma parameters, specially the collision
frequency and the density contrast. For high collision frequencies and low
density contrasts the KHI is present for super-Alfvenic velocity shear only.
For high density contrasts the threshold velocity shear can be reduced to

that the local density distribution is differentiable. This assumption is used
to derive the spatial derivatives of other quantities. However, this assumption
breaks down at the contact discontinuity. At the contact discontinuity, the
density of the low-density side is overestimated while that of the high-density
side is underestimated. As a result, the pressure of the low (high) density
side is over (under) estimated. Thus, unphysical repulsive force appears at the
contact discontinuity, resulting in the effective surface tension. This tension
suppresses fluid instabilities. In this paper, we present a new formulation of
SPH, which does not require the differentiability of density. Instead of the
mass density, we adopt the internal energy density (pressure), and its
arbitrary function, which are smoothed quantities at the contact discontinuity,
as the volume element used for the kernel integration. We call this new
formulation density independent SPH (DISPH). It handles the contact
discontinuity without numerical problems. The results of standard tests such as
the shock tube, Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, point like
explosion, and blob tests are all very favorable to DISPH. We conclude that
DISPH solved most of known difficulties of the standard SPH, without
introducing additional numerical diffusion or breaking the exact force symmetry
or energy conservation. Our new SPH includes the formulation proposed by
Ritchie & Thomas (2001) as a special case. Our formulation can be extended to
handle a non-ideal gas easily.

with an at times negative dephasing rate, the issue of ""non-Markovianity"" will
also be addressed. Crucially, given the quantum environment, the appearance of
non-Markovian dynamics turns out to be accompanied by a loss of
system-environment correlations. Depending on the initial purity of the qubit
state, these system-environment correlations may be purely classical over the
whole relevant time scale, or there may be intervals of genuine
system-environment entanglement. In the latter case, we see no obvious relation

Constraint Transition Systems, a program abstraction where termination is
decidable (based on the size-change termination principle). We show that these
programs also have a decidable complexity property: one can determine whether
the length of all transition sequences can be bounded in terms of the initial
state. This is the Bounded Termination problem. Interestingly, if a bound
exists, it must be polynomial. We prove that the bounded termination problem is
PSPACE-complete.
  We also discuss, theoretically, the use of bounds on the abstract program to
infer conclusions on a concrete program that has been abstracted. The
conclusion maybe a polynomial time bound, or in other cases polynomial space or
exponential time. We argue that the monotonicity-constraint abstraction
promises to be useful for practical complexity analysis of programs.

the differences in thermodynamic properties, such as, enthalpy of dilution and

light of the experimental data an aqueous polyelectrolyte solutions. The
simulations suggest that deviations from the fully extended (rod-like)

the flexibility of polyions, even when coupled with the ion-size effects,
cannot be blamed for qualitative differences between the theoretical results

family of predictors, we are able to build a new predictor that predicts the

$1/\sqrt{n}$. It is known that this rate cannot be improved in general. In this
paper, we show that in the particular case of the least square loss, and under
a strong assumption on the time series (phi-mixing) the remainder is actually
of order $1/n$. Thus, the optimal rate for iid variables, see e.g. Tsybakov
2003, and individual sequences, see \cite{lugosi} is, for the first time,
achieved for uniformly mixing processes. We also show that our method is
optimal for aggregating sparse linear combinations of predictors.

can be attributed to the retro-action of the coast morphology itself on the
erosive power of the sea. Destroying the weaker elements of the coast, erosion
can creates irregular seashores. In turn, the geometrical irregularity
participates in the damping of sea-waves, decreasing their erosive power. There
may then exist a mutual self-stabilization of the wave amplitude together with
the irregular morphology of the coast. A simple model of this type of
stabilization is discussed. The resulting coastline morphologies are diverse,
depending mainly on the morphology/damping coupling. In the limit case of weak
coupling, the process spontaneously builds fractal morphologies with a
dimension close to 4/3. This provides a direct connection between the coastal
erosion problem and the theory of percolation. For strong coupling, rugged but
non-fractal coasts may emerge during the erosion process, and we investigate a
geometrical characterization in these cases. The model is minimal, but can be
extended to take into account heterogeneity in the rock lithology and various
initial conditions. This allows to mimic coastline complexity, well beyond
simple fractality. Our results suggest that the irregular morphology of
coastlines as well as the stochastic nature of erosion are deeply connected
with the critical aspects of percolation phenomena.

is to design scheduling policies that always admit a pure Nash equilibrium and
guarantee a small price of anarchy for the l_k-norm social cost --- the
objective balances overall quality of service and fairness. We consider
policies with different amount of knowledge about jobs: non-clairvoyant,
strongly-local and local. The analysis relies on the smooth argument together
with adequate inequalities, called smooth inequalities. With this unified
framework, we are able to prove the following results.
  First, we study the inefficiency in l_k-norm social costs of a strongly-local
policy SPT and a non-clairvoyant policy EQUI. We show that the price of anarchy
of policy SPT is O(k). We also prove a lower bound of Omega(k/log k) for all
deterministic, non-preemptive, strongly-local and non-waiting policies
(non-waiting policies produce schedules without idle times). These results
ensure that SPT is close to optimal with respect to the class of l_k-norm
social costs. Moreover, we prove that the non-clairvoyant policy EQUI has price
of anarchy O(2^k).
  Second, we consider the makespan (l_infty-norm) social cost by making
connection within the l_k-norm functions. We revisit some local policies and
provide simpler, unified proofs from the framework's point of view. With the
highlight of the approach, we derive a local policy Balance. This policy
guarantees a price of anarchy of O(log m), which makes it the currently best
known policy among the anonymous local policies that always admit a pure Nash
equilibrium.

""Entwurf"" theory. Tullio Levi-Civita from Padua, one of the founders of tensor
calculus, objected to a major problematic element in this theory, which
reflected its global problem: its field equations were restricted to an adapted
coordinate system. Einstein proved that his gravitational tensor was a
covariant tensor for adapted coordinate systems. In an exchange of letters and
postcards that began in March 1915 and ended in May 1915, Levi-Civita presented
his objections to Einstein's above proof. Einstein tried to find ways to save
his proof, and found it hard to give it up. Finally Levi-Civita convinced
Einstein about a fault in his arguments. However, only in spring 1916, long
after Einstein had abandoned the 1914 theory, did he finally understand the
main problem with his 1914 gravitational tensor. In autumn 1915 the G\""ottingen

methods how regular forces are determined is the measurement of the drift
velocity of Brownian particles. We have obtained an exact expression for this
velocity within the hydrodynamic theory of the Brownian motion. It is shown
that the influence of the inertial and memory effects can be significant in the
force determination when the experimental times are sufficiently short. In the
second part of the work, within the same theory, we study the properties of the
thermal force driving the particles in incompressible fluids. We show that the
usual assumption for the Kubo's generalized Langevin equation (called the
""fundamental hypothesis"") that the thermal force at a time t and the velocity
of the particle in preceding times are uncorrelated, leads to an unexpected
super-diffusion of the particle. To obtain the Einstein diffusion at long
times, the mentioned hypothesis must be abandoned, which however does not
contradict to causality. Finally, we consider the ""color"" of thermal noise,

a compact manifold is positive if and only if the K--area homology coincides
with the reduced singular homology in all even degrees. In the third part we

topological structure of the network of trade in digital services (trade in
bits) and compare it with that of the more traditional flow of manufactured
goods across countries. To perform meaningful comparisons across networks with
different characteristics, we define a stochastic benchmark for the number of
connections among each country-pair, based on hypergeometric distribution.
Original data are thus filtered by means of different thresholds, so that we
only focus on the strongest links, i.e., statistically significant links. We
find that trade in bits displays a sparser and less hierarchical network
structure, which is more similar to trade in high-skill manufactured goods than
total trade. Lastly, distance plays a more prominent role in shaping the
network of international trade in physical goods than trade in digital
services.

either find that the incidence graph of the formula has bounded treewidth - a
case that is solved using model checking for monadic second order logic - or to
find many vertex-disjoint obstructions in the incidence graph. For the latter

Combining both cases leads to an approximation algorithm producing a strong
backdoor set whose size is upper bounded by a function of the optimum. Going

regulation is essential for cell viability. We provide new insight into the
underlying mechanisms, starting from a general model based on ordinary
differential equations and adapting it to the specific cases of yeast and plant
root cells. In yeast, zinc is transported by the transporters ZRT1 and ZRT2,
which are both regulated by the zinc-responsive transcription factor ZAP1.
Using biological data, parameters were estimated and analyzed, confirming the
different affinities of ZRT1 and ZRT2 reported in the literature. Furthermore,
our model suggests that the positive feedback in ZAP1 production has a
stabilizing function at high influx rates. In plant roots, various ZIP
transporters are involved in zinc uptake. Their regulation is largely unknown,
but bZIP transcription factors are thought to be involved. We set up three
putative models: activator only, activator with dimerization and
activator/inhibitor. These were fitted to measurements and analyzed.
Simulations show that the activator/inhibitor model outperforms the other two
in providing robust and stable homeostasis at reasonable parameter ranges.

result, the roles of rotation, mass loss and accretion in massive star
formation are not well understood. This study evaluates the source of the
Q-band, lambda=19.5 microns, emission of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs).
This allows us to determine the relative importance of rotation and outflow
activity in shaping the circumstellar environments of MYSOs on 1000 AU scales.
We obtained diffraction limited mid-infrared images of a sample of 20 MYSOs
using the VLT/VISIR and Subaru/COMICS instruments. For these 8 m class
telescopes and the sample selected, the diffraction limit, ~0.6"", corresponds
to approximately 1000 AU. We compare the images and the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) observed to a 2D, axis-symmetric dust radiative transfer
model that reproduces VLTI/MIDI observations of the MYSO W33A. We vary the
inclination, mass infall rate, and outflow opening angle to simultaneously
recreate the behaviour of the sample of MYSOs in the spatial and spectral
domains. The mid-IR emission of 70 percent of the MYSOs is spatially resolved.
In the majority of cases, the spatial extent of their emission and their SEDs
can be reproduced by the W33A model featuring an in-falling, rotating dusty
envelope with outflow cavities. There is independent evidence that most of the
sources which are not fit by the model are associated with ultracompact HII
regions and are thus more evolved. We find that, in general, the diverse 20
micron morphology of MYSOs can be attributed to warm dust in the walls of
outflow cavities seen at different inclinations. This implies that the warm
dust in the outflow cavity walls dominates the Q-band emission of MYSOs. In
turn, this emphasises that outflows are an ubiquitous feature of massive star
formation.

in the bottom overshooting region of the convective envelope of
intermediate-mass stars, focusing on its influence on the formation and
extension of blue loops in the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram. A diffusive
mixing model is adopted during the Red Giant Branch (RGB) phase. The properties
of the blue loop are changed by modification of the element profiles above the
H-burning shell, which results from the incomplete mixing in the bottom
overshooting region when stellar model evolves up along the RGB. Such
modification of the element profiles will lead to an increase of the opacity in
the region just above the H-burning shell and a decrease of the opacity in the
outer homogeneous convection zone, which will result in a quick decrease of the
H-shell nuclear luminosity $L_{H}$ when the stellar model evolves from the RGB
tip to its bottom and, finally, a much weaker and smaller convection zone will
be obtained in the stellar envelope. This helps to form a longer blue loop. The
extension of the blue loop is very sensitive to the parameters $(C_{X}$ and
$\alpha_{TCM})$ of the diffusive mixing model and of the TCM. The results
mainly show that: 1) comparing to the results of the classical model with the
mixing-length theory, the lengths of the obtained blue loops with different
combinations of the values of $C_{X}$ and $\alpha_{TCM}$ are all increased and
the length of the blue loop increases with the values of parameters
  $C_{X}$ and $\alpha_{TCM}$; 2) the diffusive mixing model can significantly
extend the time of stellar models lingering on the blue side of the HR diagram,
even though the length of the blue loop for the 7$M_{\odot}$ star has a less
prominent difference between the classical and diffusive mixing model;

a uniform space carries several natural topologies. One of these is the
topology of uniform convergence on bounded uniformly equicontinuous sets, or
the UEB topology for short. In the particular case of a topological group and
its right uniformity, the UEB topology plays a significant role in the
continuity of convolution. In this paper we derive a useful characterisation of
bounded uniformly equicontinuous sets on locally compact groups. Then we
demonstrate that for every locally compact group G the UEB topology on the
space of finite Radon measures on G coincides with the right multiplier

topological groups of the multiplier topology for locally compact groups. In
the final section we prove results about UEB continuity of convolution.

these shifts to be larger than 6 km s$^{-1}$, and therefore we refer to them as
{\it supersonic magnetic flows}. The average lifetime of the detected events is
81.3 s and they occupy an average area of about 23\,000 km$^2$. Most of the
events occur within granular cells and correspond therefore to upflows. However
some others occur in intergranular lanes or bear no clear relation to the
convective velocity pattern. We analyze a number of representative examples and
discuss them in terms of magnetic loops, reconnection events, and convective
collapse.

constraining models of the early Universe. In this paper we focus on the

sub-scenarios, one of which involves a long intermediate stage between
conformal rolling and conventional hot epoch. Primordial scalar perturbations
generated within these sub-scenarios have different direction-dependent power
spectra, both characterized by a single parameter h^2. We search for the
signatures of this anisotropy in the seven-year WMAP data using quadratic
maximum likelihood method, first applied for similar purposes by Hanson and
Lewis. We confirm the large quadrupole anisotropy detected in V and W bands,
which has been argued to originate from systematic effects rather than from
cosmology. We construct an estimator for the parameter h^2. In the case of the
sub-scenario with the intermediate stage we set an upper limit h^2 < 0.045 at
the 95% confidence level. The constraint on h^2 is much weaker in the case of
another sub-scenario, where the intermediate stage is absent.

among the most dramatic manifestations of solar activity, but are not well
understood despite strong links with both solar flares and coronal mass
ejections. Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) observations from the STEREO and SDO
spacecraft are used here to study their kinematics and morphology. The first
STEREO observations of a CBF are presented, with the pulse observed in all
available EUV passbands (171, 195, 284 and for the first time, 304A). The pulse
displayed similar kinematics in all passbands, although the derived pulse
velocity and acceleration were found to be strongly influenced by the observing
cadence, implying that previous kinematics may have been underestimated.
Different techniques for identifying CBFs and deriving their true kinematics
were tested, with traditional techniques shown to be prone to undefined
user-dependent errors. This was overcome through the development of a
statistically rigorous, semi-automated identification algorithm, which was then
used to determine the kinematics of four CBF events observed by STEREO. All of
the events studied exhibited clear deceleration as well as increases in both
spatial and temporal pulse width, indicating that the CBFs are dispersive. A
CBF pulse observed by both STEREO and SDO was also studied using the algorithm,
with lower initial velocity and weaker deceleration noted in STEREO
observations compared to SDO, reaffirming the effects of image cadence on the
derived kinematics. The kinematics obtained using SDO were highly passband
dependent, suggesting a compressive nature. Significant pulse broadening was
also noted in observations from both spacecraft, allowing the dispersion rate
of the pulse to be determined. These results indicate that coronal bright
fronts are best interpreted as fast-mode magnetoacoustic waves propagating in
an inhomogeneous medium.

govern the behavior of fish in their environment. In this study, we
characterized the spatial and temporal occupation of 37 acoustically tagged
bigeye scads (Selar Crumenophthalmus) in an array of shallow Fish Aggregating
Devices (FADs) to clarify the mechanism that leads fish to associate with FADs.
A comparison of the number of visits and residence times exhibited by the fish
at different FADs revealed a strong variability over the array of FADS, with
the emergence of a leading FAD, which recorded the majority of visits and
retained the fish for a longer period of time. We found diel variability in the
residence times, with fish associated at daytime and exploring the array of
FADs at nighttime. We demonstrated that this diel temporal pattern was
amplified in the leading FAD. We identified a 24-hour periodicity for a subset
of individuals aggregated to the leading FAD, thus suggesting that those fish
were able to find this FAD after night excursions. The modeling of fish
movements based on a Monte Carlo sampling of inter-FAD transitions revealed
that the observed spatial heterogeneity in the number of visits could not be
explained through simple array-connectivity arguments. Similarly, we
demonstrated that the high residence times recorded at the leading FAD were not
due to the spatial arrangement of individual fish having different associative
characters. We discussed the relationships between these patterns of
association with the FADs, the exploration of the FAD array and the possible
effects of social interactions and environmental factors.
