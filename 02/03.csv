state in a multi-channel opportunistic communication system, where the state of
each channel evolves as an independent and identically distributed Markov
process. The considered problem can be cast into a restless multi-armed bandit
(RMAB) problem that is of fundamental importance in decision theory. It is
well-known that solving the RMAB problem is PSPACE-hard, with the optimal
policy usually intractable due to the exponential computation complexity. A
natural alternative is to consider the easily implementable myopic policy that
maximizes the immediate reward but ignores the impact of the current strategy
on the future reward. In this paper, we perform an analytical study on the
optimality of the myopic policy under imperfect sensing for the considered RMAB
problem. Specifically, for a family of generic and practically important
utility functions, we establish the closed-form conditions under which the
myopic policy is guaranteed to be optimal even under imperfect sensing. Despite
our focus on the opportunistic channel access, the obtained results are generic

velocity constraints on nucleosynthesis ejecta down to ~100 km/s. Core-collapse
supernovae apparently do not always produce significant amounts of 44Ti, as in
the Galaxy fewer sources than expected from the supernova rate have been found.
INTEGRAL's 44Ti data on the well-observed Cas A and SN1987A events are evidence
that non-spherical explosions and 44Ti production may be correlated.
Characteristic gamma-ray lines from radioactive decays of long-lived 26Al and
60Fe isotopes have been exploited to obtain information on the structure and
dynamics of massive stars in their late evolution and supernovae, as their
yields are sensitive to those details. The extended INTEGRAL mission
establishes a database of sufficiently-deep observations of several specific
regions of massive star groups, such as Cygnus, Carina, and Sco-Cen. In the
inner Galaxy, 26Al nucleosynthesis gamma-rays help to unravel the Galaxy's
structure and the role of a central bar, as the kinematically-shifted 26Al
gamma-ray line energy records the longitude-velocity behavior of hot
interstellar gas. Thus, INTEGRAL has consolidated the feasibility of
constraining cosmic nucleosynthesis through gamma-ray line observations. Due to
its extended mission INTEGRAL maintains its chance to also see rare
sufficiently-nearby events, such as a nova to provide first nova
nucleosynthesis measurements of 7Be and 22Na production.

detected. Although the errors on the estimated fluxes are large, the source
appears to be brighter by several tens of percents during the February 2007
observation compared to the August 2006 observation. During both observations
the 2-10 keV luminosity of the source was close to ~10^{33} erg/s for an
assumed distance of 10 kpc. However, we note that the distance to this source
is not well constrained and it has been suggested it might be as far as 35 kpc
which would result in an order of magnitude higher luminosities. If the
empirically found relation between the orbital period and the quiescence
luminosity of black hole transients is also valid for IGR J17091-3624, then we
can estimate an orbital period of >100 hours (>4 days) for a distance of 10 kpc
but it could be as large as tens of days if the source is truly much further
away. Such a large orbital period would be similar to GRS 1915+105 which has an
orbital period of ~34 days. Orbital periods this large could possibly be
connected to the fact that both sources exhibit the same very violent and
extreme rapid X-ray variability which has so far not yet been seen from any

might be more in line with the other systems (<100 hours) but we happened to
have observed the source in an episode of elevated accretion which was
significantly higher than its true quiescent accretion rate. In that case, the

dependence on galaxy properties (luminosity, apparent magnitude, galaxy size,
redshift and morphological type). The color gradient is measured by the
difference of v-i color outside (R_{50}<r<2R_{50}) and inside the half light
radius. The gradient shows little evolution with redshift up to z~1 but
increases from z~1 to z~2 before flattening out. It also increases with
apparent magnitude, with a median value of 0.24 magnitudes at i_{AB}~25.5. It
has a strong color dependence, with the bluest galaxies (in terms of observed
color) having cores that are bluer relative to their outskirts. We probe the
redshift evolution by stacking galaxies and measuring the radial variation of
v-i color within them. At low redshifts (z<0.5), the centres of galaxies
(r<R_{50}) are slightly redder than their outskirts (1.5R_{50}<r<2R_{50}).
Galaxies at z~1 and -22.0<M_I<-21.0 are bluer in their cores by 0.1 magnitudes,
on average, compared to their outskirts. For z>1, galaxies show increasingly
bluer cores while the color of the outskirts does not change as rapidly. At
z~2.5 and -22.0<M_I<-21.0, we observe a difference, on average, of 0.4
magnitudes between the centre and the outskirts. The observed color gradients
may indicate that strong star formation in galaxies at z>=2 is concentrated in
their central regions. These color gradients and their dependence on galaxy
properties could also have a significant impact on shear measurements in

biometrical studies, especially in pharmacokinetics research and HIV dynamics
models, due to, among other aspects, the computational advances achieved during
the last years. However, this kind of models may not be flexible enough for
complex longitudinal data analysis. Semiparametric NLMEs (SNMMs) have been
proposed by Ke and Wang (2001). These models are a good compromise and retain
nice features of both parametric and nonparametric models resulting in more
flexible models than standard parametric NLMEs. However, SNMMs are complex
models for which estimation still remains a challenge. The estimation procedure
proposed by Ke and Wang (2001) is based on a combination of log-likelihood
approximation methods for parametric estimation and smoothing splines
techniques for nonparametric estimation. In this work, we propose new
estimation strategies in SNMMs. On the one hand, we use the Stochastic
Approximation version of EM algorithm (Delyon et al., 1999) to obtain exact ML
and REML estimates of the fixed effects and variance components. On the other
hand, we propose a LASSO-type method to estimate the unknown nonlinear
function. We derive oracle inequalities for this nonparametric estimator. We
combine the two approaches in a general estimation procedure that we illustrate
with simulated and real data.

different degrees of freedom, which is crucial in non-equilibrium systems. In
particular we consider a stochastic system where two degrees of freedom $X_1$
and $X_2$ - in contact with two different thermostats - are coupled together.
The production of entropy and the violation of equilibrium
fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) are both related to the cross-correlation
between $X_1$ and $X_2$. Information about such cross-correlation may be lost
when single-variable reduced models, for $X_1$, are considered. Two different
procedures are typically applied: (a) one totally ignores the coupling with
$X_2$; (b) one models the effect of $X_2$ as an average memory effect,
obtaining a generalized Langevin equation. In case (a) discrepancies between
the system and the model appear both in entropy production and linear response;
the latter can be exploited to define effective temperatures, but those are
meaningful only when time-scales are well separated. In case (b) linear
response of the model well reproduces that of the system; however the loss of
information is reflected in a loss of entropy production. When only linear
forces are present, such a reduction is dramatic and makes the average entropy
production vanish, posing problems in interpreting FDT violations.

NGC6762 can be best explained by photoionization by pAGB stars without the need
of invoking any other excitation mechanism. In the case of NGC5966, the
presence of a nuclear ionizing source seems to be required to shape the
elongated gas emission feature in the ionization cone scenario, although
ionization by pAGB stars cannot be ruled out.(abridged)

result from the slowing and eventual capture of neutrons. These include
capture-gated neutron spectrometry, multiple neutron counting for fissile
material detection and identification, and antineutrino detection. There are
several distinct processes that result in correlated signals in these
applications. Depending on the application, one class of correlated events can
be a background that is difficult to distinguish from the class that is of
interest. Furthermore, the correlation timing distribution depends on the
neutron capture agent and detector geometry. Here, we explain the important
characteristics of the neutron capture timing distribution, making reference to
simulations and data from a number of detectors currently in use or under
development. We point out several features that may assist in background
discrimination, and that must be carefully accounted for if accurate detection
efficiencies are to be quoted.

extremes. Starting from the fact that the dependence structure of a max-stable
process is completely characterized by an extreme-value copula, a class of
goodness-of-fit tests is proposed based on the comparison between a
nonparametric and a parametric estimator of the corresponding unknown
multivariate Pickands dependence function. Because of the high-dimensional
setting under consideration, these functional estimators are only compared at a
specific set of points at which they coincide, up to a multiplicative constant,
with estimators of the extremal coefficients. The nonparametric estimators of
the Pickands dependence function used in this work are those recently studied
by Gudendorf and Segers. The parametric estimators rely on the use of the {\em
pairwise pseudo-likelihood} which extends the concept of pairwise (composite)
likelihood to a rank-based context. Approximate $p$-values for the resulting
margin-free tests are obtained by means of a {\em one- or two-level parametric
bootstrap}. Conditions for the asymptotic validity of these resampling
procedures are given based on the work of Genest and R\'emillard. The
finite-sample performance of the tests is investigated in dimension 10 under
the Smith, Schlather and geometric Gaussian models. An application of the tests
to rainfall data is finally presented.

processes varying at a local level, are flexible and useful tools for analyzing
spatial data. One approach places stationary Gaussian process priors on the
spatial processes, but in applications the data may display strong
nonstationary patterns. In this article, we propose a Bayesian variable
selection approach based on wavelet tools to address this problem. The proposed
approach does not involve any stationarity assumptions on the priors, and
instead we impose a mixture prior directly on each wavelet coefficient. We
introduce an option to control the priors such that high resolution
coefficients are more likely to be zero. Computationally efficient MCMC
procedures are provided to address posterior sampling, and uncertainty in the
estimation is assessed through posterior means and standard deviations.
Examples based on simulated data demonstrate the estimation accuracy and

with input from orbital structure analysis and from observations. The thick
part has a considerably shorter radial extent than the thin part. I then see
how this applies to our Galaxy, where two bars have been reported, the
COBE/DIRBE bar and the Long bar. Comparing their extents and making the
reasonable and necessary assumption that our Galaxy has properties similar to
those of other galaxies of similar type, leads to the conclusion that these two
bars can not form a standard double bar system. I then discuss arguments in

COBE/DIRBE bar being the thick inner part and the Long bar being the thin outer
part of this bar. I also very briefly discuss some related new results. I first
consider bar formation and evolution in disc galaxies with a gaseous component

I consider bar formation in a fully cosmological context using hydrodynamical
LCDM simulations, where the host galaxies grow, accrete matter and
significantly evolve during the formation and evolution of the bar.

requires not only optimal codes but also receivers that make collective
measurements on long (modulated) codeword waveforms, and it is impossible to
implement these collective measurements via symbol-by-symbol detection along
with classical postprocessing. Here, we apply our recent results on the
classical-quantum polar code---the first near-explicit, linear,
symmetric-Holevo-rate achieving code---to the lossy optical channel, and we
show that it almost closes the entire gap to the Holevo capacity in the low
photon number regime. In contrast, Arikan's original polar codes, applied to
the DMC induced by the physical optical channel paired with any conceivable
structured optical receiver (including optical homodyne, heterodyne, or
direct-detection) fails to achieve the ultimate Holevo limit to channel
capacity. However, our polar code construction (which uses the quantum fidelity
as a channel parameter rather than the classical Bhattacharyya quantity to
choose the ""good channels"" in the polar-code construction), paired with a
quantum successive-cancellation receiver---which involves a sequence of
collective non-destructive binary projective measurements on the joint quantum
state of the received codeword waveform---can attain the Holevo limit, and can
hence in principle achieve higher rates than Arikan's polar code and decoder
directly applied to the optical channel. However, even a theoretical recipe for
construction of an optical realization of the quantum successive-cancellation
receiver remains an open question.

departure from R^1XS^3 slicing of AdS_5 noticing that the inverse radius, R, of

satisfy, \hbar c/R >> \Lambda_{QCD}. We then focus on the eigenvalue problem of
the S^3 conformal Laplacian, given by 1/R^2 (K^2+1), with K^2 standing for the
Casimir invariant of the so(4) algebra. Such a spectrum is characterized by a
(K+1)^2 fold degeneracy of its levels, with K\in [0,\infty). We then break the
conformal S^3 metric as, d\tilde{s}^2=e^{-b\chi} ((1+b^2/4) d\chi^2 +\sin^2\chi
(d\theta ^2 +\sin^2\theta d\varphi ^2)), and attribute the symmetry breaking
scale, b\hbar^2c^2/R^2, to the dilaton. We show that such a metric deformation
is equivalent to a breaking of the conformal curvature of S^3 by a term
proportional to b\cot \chi, and that the perturbed conformal Laplacian is
equivalent to (\tilde{K}^2 +c_K), with c_K a representation constant, and
\tilde{K}^2 being again an so(4) Casimir invariant, but this time in a
representation unitarily inequivalent to the 4D rotational. In effect, the
spectra before and after the symmetry breaking are determined each by
eigenvalues of a Casimir invariant of an so(4) algebra, a reason for which the
degeneracies remain unaltered though the conformal group symmetry breaks at the
level of the representation of its algebra. We fit the S^3 radius and the
\hbar^2c^2b/R^2 scale to the high-lying excitations in the spectra of the
unflavored mesons, and observe the correct tendency of the \hbar c /R=373 MeV

is mostly from dust that has a temperature and emissivity index similar to that
of dust in the local ISM in our galaxy, with the temperature generally
increasing towards the centre of each galaxy. We calibrate the dust method
using the CO and 21-cm observations to provide an independent estimate of the
mass of hydrogen in each galaxy, solving the problem of the uncertain `X
factor' for the molecular gas by minimizing the dispersion in the ratio of the
masses estimated using the two methods. With the calibration for the dust
method and the estimate of the X-factor produced in this way, the dispersion in
the ratio of the two gas masses is 30%, which gives an upper limit on the
fundamental accuracy of the dust method. The calibration we obtain for the dust

distribution of the stellar disks is calculated using 3D LTE spectrum formation
and opacity sampling. We test our predictions using least-squares fits of model
light curves to primary eclipses that were observed with the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST).
  The limb darkening law derived from the 3D model of HD 209458 between 2900 A
and 5700 A produces significantly better fits to the HST data, removing
systematic residuals that were previously observed for model light curves based
on 1D predictions. This difference arises mainly from the shallower mean
temperature structure of the 3D model, which is a consequence of the explicit
simulation of surface granulation. In the case of HD 189733, the model
atmospheres produce practically equivalent limb darkening curves between 2900 A
and 5700 A, partly due to obstruction by spectral lines, and the data are not
sufficient to distinguish between the light curves. We also analyze HST
observations between 5350 A and 10500 A for this star; the 3D model leads to a
better fit compared to 1D predictions.
  The significant improvement of fit quality for the HD 209458 system
demonstrates the higher degree of realism of 3D models and the importance of
surface granulation for the formation of the atmospheric radiation field of
late-type stars. This result agrees well with recent investigations of limb
darkening in the solar continuum and other observational tests. The case of HD
189733 is no contradiction as the model light curves are less sensitive to the
temperature stratification of the atmosphere and the observed data in the 2900
A - 5700 A region are not sufficient to distinguish more clearly between 3D and
1D limb darkening.

the evolution of a disc galaxy within the global tidal field of a group
environment. Both the disc galaxy and the group are modelled as
multi-component, collision-less, N-body systems, composed by both dark matter
and stars. In our simulations, the evolution of disc galaxies is followed as
their orbits sink towards the group centre, under the effect of dynamical
friction. We explore a broad parameter space, covering several aspects of the
galaxy-group interaction that are potentially relevant to galaxy evolution.
Namely, prograde and retrograde orbits, orbital eccentricities, disc
inclination, role of a central bulge in discs, internal disc kinematics, and
galaxy-to-group mass ratios. We find that significant disc transformations
occur only after the mean density of the group, measured within the orbit of
the galaxy, exceeds ~0.3-1 times the central mean density of the galaxy. The
morphological evolution of discs is found to be strongly dependent on the
initial inclination of the disc with respect to its orbital plane. That is,
discs on face-on and retrograde orbits are shown to retain longer their disc
structures and kinematics, in comparison to prograde discs. This suggests that
after interacting with the global tidal field alone, a significant fraction of
disc galaxies should be found in the central regions of groups. Prominent
central bulges are not produced, and pre-existing bulges are not enhanced in
discs after the interaction with the group. Assuming that most S0 are formed in
group environments, this implies that prominent bulges should be formed mostly
by young stars, created only after a galaxy has been accreted by a group.
Finally, contrary to some current implementations of tidal stripping in
semi-analytical models of galaxy evolution, we find that more massive galaxies
suffer more tidal stripping.

important issue for understanding the physics of the early spin evolution of
millisecond pulsars is the impact of the expanding magnetosphere during the
terminal stages of the mass-transfer process. Here I report binary stellar
evolution calculations that show that the braking torque acting on a neutron
star, when the companion star decouples from its Roche-lobe, is able to
dissipate >50% of the rotational energy of the pulsar. This effect may explain
the apparent difference in observed spin distributions between x-ray and radio
millisecond pulsars and help account for the noticeable age discrepancy with
their young white dwarf companions.

the solar circle in which supernovae drive turbulence and determine the
vertical stratification of the medium. The simulations were run using a stable,
positivity-preserving scheme for ideal MHD implemented in the FLASH code. We
find that the majority (\approx 90 %) of the mass is contained in
thermally-stable temperature regimes of cold molecular and atomic gas at T <
200 K or warm atomic and ionized gas at 5000 K < T < 10^{4.2} K, with strong
peaks in probability distribution functions of temperature in both the cold and
warm regimes. The 200 - 10^{4.2} K gas fills 50-60 % of the volume near the
plane, with hotter gas associated with supernova remnants (30-40 %) and cold
clouds (< 10 %) embedded within. At |z| ~ 1-2 kpc, transition-temperature (10^5
K) gas accounts for most of the mass and volume, while hot gas dominates at |z|
> 3 kpc. The magnetic field in our models has no significant impact on the
scale heights of gas in each temperature regime; the magnetic tension force is
approximately equal to and opposite the magnetic pressure, so the addition of
the field does not significantly affect the vertical support of the gas. The
addition of a magnetic field does reduce the fraction of gas in the cold (< 200
K) regime with a corresponding increase in the fraction of warm (~ 10^4 K) gas.
However, our models lack rotational shear and thus have no large-scale dynamo,
which reduces the role of the field in the models compared to reality. The
supernovae drive oscillations in the vertical distribution of halo gas, with
the period of the oscillations ranging from ~ 30 Myr in the T < 200 K gas to ~
100 Myr in the 10^6 K gas, in line with predictions by Walters & Cox.

log_10 Mstar < 9.4. These values imply DM profiles flatter than those obtained
in DM--only simulations and in close agreement with those inferred in galaxies
from the THINGS and LITTLE THINGS survey. Only in very small halos, where by
z=0 star formation has converted less than ~ 0.03% of the original baryon
abundance into stars, outflows do not flatten the original cuspy DM profile out
to radii resolved by our simulations. The mass (DM and baryonic) measured
within the inner 500 pc of each simulated galaxy remains nearly constant over
four orders of magnitudes in stellar mass for Mstar 10^9 Msolar. This finding
is consistent with estimates for faint Local Group dwarfs and field galaxies.

isothermal in four runs, whereas radiative cooling is included in the fifth
run. In all the simulations, the molecular cloud is tidally disrupted, spirals
towards the GC, and forms a small, dense and eccentric disk around SgrA*. With
high resolution simulations, we follow the fragmentation of the gaseous disk.
Star candidates form in a ring at ~0.1-0.4 pc from the super-massive black hole

the observations. The mass function of star candidates is top-heavy only if the
local gas temperature is high (>~100 K) during the star formation and if the
parent cloud is sufficiently massive (>~10^5 solar masses). Thus, this study
indicates that the infall of a massive molecular cloud is a viable scenario for

accompanied by excess infrared emission, indicating that they are encircled by
a compact dusty disk of solid debris. Such `WD debris disks' are thought to
originate from the tidal disruption of asteroids or other minor bodies, but the
precise mechanism(s) responsible for transporting matter to the WD surface
remains unclear, especially in those systems with the highest inferred metal
accretion rates dM_Z/dt ~ 1e8-1e10 g/s. Here we present global time-dependent
calculations of the coupled evolution of the gaseous and solid components of WD
debris disks. Solids transported inwards (initially due to PR drag) sublimate
at tens of WD radii, producing a source of gas that accretes onto the WD
surface and viscously spreads outwards in radius, where it overlaps with the
solid disk. If the aerodynamic coupling between the solids and gaseous disks is
sufficiently strong (and/or the gas viscosity sufficiently weak), then gas
builds up near the sublimation radius faster than it can viscously spread away.
Since the rate of drag-induced solid accretion increases with gas density, this
results in a runaway accretion process, during which the WD accretion rate
reaches values orders of magnitude higher than can be achieved by PR drag
alone. We explore the evolution of WD debris disks across a wide range of
physical conditions and calculate the predicted distribution of observed
accretion rates dM_Z/dt, finding reasonable agreement with the current sample.
Although the conditions necessary for runaway accretion are at best marginally
satisfied given the minimal level of aerodynamic drag between circular gaseous
and solid disks, the presence of other stronger forms of solid-gas
coupling---such as would result if the gaseous disk is only mildly
eccentric---substantially increase the likelihood of runaway accretion.

parameters by asserting that the dark matter halos of the lightest dwarf
spheroidal (dSph) galaxies consist of a single charge Q=1 monopole. Lensing and
wide binary bounds are then easily satisfied and the monopoles form in time to
help with CMB fluctuations. In this model dSph and low surface brightness (LSB)
halos automatically have (1) A minimum mass - Dirac quantization solves the
missing satellite problem, (2) A constant density core (r<r_1), (3) An
intermediate regime (r_1<r<r_2) with density proportional to 1/r^2. The model
predicts that (A) r_1 is proportional to the stellar rotational/dispersion
velocities at r_1<r<r_2, (B) r_2 is reasonably Q independent and so dSph halos
extend at least ten times farther than their half-light and tidal radii, (C)
The minimal stellar dispersion is 1/sqrt{2} times the next-smallest allowed
value. A serious potential problem with our proposal is that non-BPS monopoles
are repulsive. The Jackiw-Rebbi mechanism yields four species of monopoles, and
we assume that, for some choice of Yukawa couplings, one species is light and
serves only to screen the repulsive interactions of another.

short time intervals, due to the higher harmonics of the charge response. The

due to homeostatic pressure and active cytoskeleton dynamics. While much is
known about the molecular pathways of adhesion, the role of mechanics is less
well understood. To isolate the role of pressure we present a dense packing of
functionalized emulsion droplets in which surface interactions are tuned to
mimic those of real cells. By visualizing the microstructure in 3D we find that
a threshold compression force is necessary to overcome electrostatic repulsion
and surface elasticity and establish protein-mediated adhesion. Varying the
droplet interaction potential maps out a phase diagram for adhesion as a
function of force and salt concentration. Remarkably, fitting the data with our
theoretical model predicts binder concentrations in the adhesion areas that are
similar to those found in real cells. Moreover, we quantify the adhesion size
dependence on the applied force and thus reveal adhesion strengthening with
increasing homeostatic pressure even in the absence of active cellular
processes. This biomimetic approach reveals the physical origin of
pressure-sensitive adhesion and its strength across cell-cell junctions.

model, which combines the continuous description of the
Hall-Vinen-Bekeravich-Khalatnikov equations with the additional constraint that
this continuous description cannot extend beyond a quantum length scale
associated with the mean spacing between individual superfluid vortices. A good
agreement is found with experimental measurements of the vortex density.
Besides, by varying the turbulence intensity only, it is observed that the
inter-vortex spacing varies with the Reynolds number as $Re^{-3/4}$, like the
viscous length scale in classical turbulence. In the high temperature limit,
Kolmogorov's inertial cascade is recovered, as expected from previous numerical
and experimental studies. As the temperature decreases, the inertial cascade
remains present at large scales while, at small scales, the system evolves
towards a statistical equipartition of kinetic energy among spectral modes,
with a characteristic $k^2$ velocity spectrum. The accumulation of superfluid
excitations on a range of mesoscales enables the superfluid to keep dissipating
kinetic energy through mutual friction with the residual normal fluid, although
the later becomes rare at low temperature. It is found that most of the
superfluid vorticity can concentrate on these mesoscales at low temperature,
while it is concentrated in the inertial range at higher temperature. This
observation should have consequences on the interpretation of decaying
turbulence experiments, which are often based on vortex line density
measurements.

number of antennas at each BS and the number of users in each cell both grow
large with their ratio tending to a finite constant, the dimensionality of the
optimization is greatly reduced, and only knowledge of statistics is required
to solve it. The optimal solution is characterized in general, and an algorithm
is proposed that converges to the optimal transmit parameters, for feasible
SINR targets. For the two cell case, a simple single parameter characterization
is obtained. These asymptotic results provide insights into the average
performance, as well as simple but efficient beamforming strategies for the

to achieve a generalized theory of superconductivity, there is need to first
developed a quantitative structure model of the Cooper pair formation (CPF) in
line with the formulation of the molecules in nature which has given birth to
hadronic mechanics. This generalized formulation is the iso-superonductivity

instruments give much better understanding of the behavior of some elusive
solar features, such as pores and naked sunspots. Their fast evolution and, in
some cases, their small sizes have made their study difficult. The moving
magnetic features, despite being more dynamic structures, have been studied
during the last 40 years. They have been always associated with sunspots,
especially with the penumbra. However, a recent observation of a naked sunspot
(one with no penumbra) has shown MMF activity. The authors of this reported
observation expressed their reservations about the explanation given to the
bipolar MMF activity as an extension of the penumbral filaments into the moat.
How can this type of MMFs exist when a penumbra does not? In this paper, we
study the full magnetic and (horizontal) velocity topology of the same naked
sunspot, showing how the existence of a magnetic field topology similar to that
observed in sunspots can explain these MMFs, even when the intensity map of the
naked sunspot does not show a penumbra.

emerging from the solar photosphere is known since the 1970s. These profiles
require the presence of a velocity gradient along the line of sight, possibly
associated with gradients of magnetic field strength, inclination and/or
azimuth. We have focused our study on the Stokes V profiles showing extreme
asymmetry in the from of only one lobe. Using Hinode spectropolarimetric
measurements we have performed a statistical study of the properties of these
profiles in the quiet sun. We show their spatial distribution, their main
physical properties, how they are related with several physical observables and
their behavior with respect to their position on the solar disk. The single
lobed Stokes V profiles occupy roughly 2% of the solar surface. For the first
time, we have observed their temporal evolution and have retrieved the physical
conditions of the atmospheres from which they emerged using an inversion code
implementing discontinuities of the atmospheric parameters along the line of
sight. In addition, we use synthetic Stokes profiles from 3D magnetoconvection
simulations to complement the results of the inversion. The main features of
the synthetic single-lobed profiles are in general agreement with the observed
ones, lending support to the magnetic and dynamic topologies inferred from the
inversion. The combination of all these different analysis suggests that most

emergence and/or submergence processes taking place in small patches in the

map is used to identify diffuse ionized regions (DIR) in the Galaxy (Rahman &
Murray 2010). It has been found that the 18 most luminous WMAP sources produce
more than half of the total ionizing luminosity of the Galaxy. We observed
radio recombination lines (RRLs) toward the luminous WMAP source G49.75-0.45
with the Green Bank Telescope near 1.4 GHz. Hydrogen RRL is detected toward the
source but no helium line is detected, implying that n_He+/n_H+ < 0.024. This
limit puts severe constraint on the ionizing spectrum. The total ionizing
luminosity of G49 (3.05 x 10^51 s^-1) is ~ 2.8 times the luminosity of all
radio HII regions within this DIR and this is generally the case for other WMAP
sources. Murray & Rahman (2010) propose that the additional ionization is due
to massive clusters (~ 7.5 x10^3 Msun for G49) embedded in the WMAP sources.
Such clusters should produce enough photons with energy \geq 24.6 eV to fully
ionize helium in the DIR. Our observations rule out a simple model with G49
ionized by a massive cluster. We also considered 'leaky' HII region models for
the ionization of the DIR, suggested by Lockman and Anantharamaiah, but these
models also cannot explain our observations. We estimate that the helium
ionizing photons need to be attenuated by > ~10 times to explain the
observations. If selective absorption of He- ionizing photons by dust is
causing this additional attenuation, then the ratio of dust absorption cross
sections for He- and H- ionizing photons should be > ~6.

We illustrate this framework by starting with a deterministic toy model,
whereby $N$ independent traders buy and sell $M$ stocks through an order book
that acts as a clearing house. The price of a stock increases whenever it is
bought and decreases whenever it is sold. Price changes are updated by the
order book before the next transaction takes place. In this deterministic
model, all traders based their buy decisions on a call utility function, and
all their sell decisions on a put utility function. We then make the
agent-based model more realistic, by either having a fraction $f_b$ of traders
buy a random stock on offer, or a fraction $f_s$ of traders sell a random stock
in their portfolio. Based on our simulations, we find that it is possible to
identify useful order parameters from the steady-state price distributions of
all three models. Using these order parameters as a guide, we find three
phases: (i) the dead market; (ii) the boom market; and (iii) the jammed market
in the the phase diagram of the deterministic model. Comparing the phase
diagrams of the stochastic models against that of the deterministic model, we
realize that the primary effect of stochasticity is to eliminate the dead
market phase.

over time. With different amounts of delay, two conferencing strategies are
proposed, each of which can be implemented by either a general two-side
conferencing scheme (for which both of the two conferencing links are used) or
a special-case one-side conferencing scheme (for which only one of the two

scheme, we derive the achievable rates by using the decode-and-forward (DF) and

maximization problems are convex. By further exploiting the properties of the
optimal solutions, the simpler one-side conferencing is shown to be equally
good as the two-side conferencing in term of the achievable rates under
arbitrary channel conditions. Based on this, the DF rate in closed-form is
obtained, and the principle to use which one of the two conferencing links for
one-side conferencing is also established. Moreover, the DF scheme is shown to
be capacity-achieving under certain conditions with even one-side conferencing.
For the AF relaying scheme, one-side conferencing is shown to be sub-optimal in
general. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate our analysis.

the physical properties of a large sample of high redshift galaxies. We
implement a gas outflow model for each galaxy based on simple scaling
arguments. The coupling with a library of numerical experiments of Ly-a
transfer through expanding or static dusty shells of gas allows us to derive
the Ly-a escape fractions and profiles. The predicted distribution of Ly-a
photons escape fraction shows that galaxies with a low star formation rate have
a f_esc of the order of unity, suggesting that, for those objects, Ly-a may be
used to trace the star formation rate assuming a given conversion law. In
galaxies forming stars intensely, the escape fraction spans the whole range
from 0 to 1. The model is able to get a good match to the UV and Ly-a
luminosity function (LF) data at 3 < z < 5. We find that we are in good
agreement with both the bright Ly-a data and the faint population observed by
Rauch et al. (2008) at z=3. Most of the Ly-a profiles of our LAEs are
redshifted by the diffusion in the outflow which suppresses IGM absorption. The
bulk of the observed Ly-a equivalent width (EW) distribution is recovered by
our model, but we fail to obtain the very large values sometimes detected.
Predictions for stellar masses and UV LFs of LAEs show a satisfactory agreement
with observational estimates. The UV-brightest galaxies are found to show only
low Ly-a EWs in our model, as it is reported by many observations of high
redshift LAEs. We interpret this effect as the joint consequence of old stellar
populations hosted by UV-bright galaxies, and high HI column densities that we
predict for these objects, which quench preferentially resonant Ly-a photons
via dust extinction.

Multi-stage Interconnection Network (3DCGMIN) using the approaches and
solutions provided by the Stable Matching Problem. Specifically Stable Marriage
Problem is used as an example of Stable Matching. For MINs to prove Stable two
existing algorithms are used:-the first algorithm generates the MINs
Preferences List in time and second algorithm produces a set of most Optimal
Pairs of the Switching Elements (SEs) (derived from the MINs Preferences List)
in time. Moreover, the paper also solves the problem of Ties that occurs
between the Optimal Pairs. The results are promising as the comparison of the
MINs based on their stability shows that the ASEN, ABN, CLN, GMIN, 3DCGMIN are
highly stable in comparison to HZTN, QTN, DGMIN. However, on comparing the
irregular and regular MINs in totality upon their stability the regular MINs
comes out to be more stable than the irregular MINs.

provided to support concurrency; as managing locks can be very difficult and

extensively used to provide synchronization between multiple processors [1] in
general-purpose systems. It has been shown that locks have numerous
shortcomings over transactional memory in terms of power consumption, ease of

the slave boson mean field approximation (SBMFA). First, for a resonant level
model such as results from the SBMFA, we find the joint distribution of energy
levels with and without the resonant level present. Second, if only energy
levels within the Kondo resonance are considered, the distributions of
perturbed levels collapse to universal forms for both orthogonal and unitary
ensembles for all values of the coupling. These universal curves are described
well by a simple Wigner-surmise type toy model. Third, we study the

small. Finally, the change in the intensity of an eigenfunction at an arbitrary

during the 2010 August 1 events using STEREO/SECCHI COR and HI data. We obtain
the direction of motion for both CMEs by applying several independent
reconstruction methods and find that the CMEs head in similar directions. This
provides evidence that a full interaction takes place between the two CMEs that
can be observed in the HI1 field-of-view. The full de-projected kinematics of
the faster CME from Sun to Earth is derived by combining remote observations
with in situ measurements of the CME at 1 AU. The speed profile of the faster
CME (CME2; ~1200 km/s) shows a strong deceleration over the distance range at
which it reaches the slower, preceding CME (CME1; ~700 km/s). By applying a
drag-based model we are able to reproduce the kinematical profile of CME2
suggesting that CME1 represents a magnetohydrodynamic obstacle for CME2 and
that, after the interaction, the merged entity propagates as a single structure
in an ambient flow of speed and density typical for quiet solar wind
conditions. Observational facts show that magnetic forces may contribute to the
enhanced deceleration of CME2. We speculate that the increase in magnetic
tension and pressure, when CME2 bends and compresses the magnetic field lines
of CME1, increases the efficiency of drag.

range of materials, which are collectively known as electron glasses. We report
dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of the standard electron glass lattice model.
In a non-equilibrium state, the electrons will often form a Fermi distribution
with an effective electron temperature higher than the phonon bath temperature.
We study the effective temperature as a function of time in three different
situations: relaxation after a quench from an initial random state, during
driving by an external electric field and during relaxation after such driving.
We observe logarithmic relaxation of the effective temperature after a quench
from a random initial state as well as after driving the system for some time
$t_w$ with a strong electric field. For not too strong electric field and not
too long $t_w$ we observe that data for the effective temperature at different
waiting times collapse when plotted as functions of $t/t_w$ -- the so-called
simple aging. During the driving period we study how the effective temperature
is established, separating the contributions from the sites involved in jumps
from those that were not involved. It is found that the heating mainly affects
the sites involved in jumps, but at strong driving, also the remaining sites
are heated.

order to solve this kind of optimization problem, but sometimes fail when the
constraint bounding the state vector at the initial time is not a norm, meaning
that some part of the state vector remains unbounded and might cause the

Rayleigh numbers (Ra > 1E12) and for Prandtl numbers of order one, experiments
fall into two categories: some evidence a steep enhancement of the heat
transfer while others do not. The origin of this apparent disagreement is
presently unexplained. This puzzling situation motivated a systematic study of
the triggering of the regime with an enhanced heat transfer, originally named
the ""Ultimate Regime"" of convection. High accuracy heat transfer measurements
have been conducted in convection cells with various aspect ratios and
different specificities, such as altered boundary conditions or obstacles
inserted in the flow. The two control parameters, the Rayleigh and Prandtl
numbers have been varied independently to disentangle their relative influence.
Among other results, it is found that i) most experiments reaching very high
$Ra$ are not in disagreement if small differences in Prandtl numbers are taken
into account, ii) the transition is not directly triggered by the large scale
circulation present in the cell, iii) the sidewall of the cell have a
significant influence on the transition. The characteristics of this Ultimate
regime are summarized and compared with R. Kraichnan prediction for the

response of molecules driven far from equilibrium to be modeled. This method is
applied to the interaction of molecules with intense, short-duration laser
pulses. The electronic response of the molecule is described using
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and the resulting Kohn-Sham
equations are solved numerically using finite difference techniques in
conjunction with local and global adaptations of an underlying grid in
curvilinear coordinates. Using this approach, simulations can be carried out
for a wide range of molecules and both all-electron and pseudopotential
calculations are possible. The approach is applied to the study of high
harmonic generation in N2 and benzene using linearly-polarized laser pulses
and, to the best of our knowledge, the results for benzene represent the first
TDDFT calculations of high harmonic generation in benzene using linearly
polarized laser pulses. For N2 an enhancement of the cut-off harmonics is
observed whenever the laser polarization is aligned perpendicular to the
molecular axis. This enhancement is attributed to the symmetry properties of
the Kohn-Sham orbital that responds predominantly to the pulse. In benzene we
predict that a suppression in the cut-off harmonics occurs whenever the laser
polarization is aligned parallel to the molecular plane. We attribute this
suppression to the symmetry-induced response of the highest-occupied molecular
orbital.

topological features on the dynamics of an evolutionary algorithm, considering
in particular the ability to find a large number of optima on multi-modal

we apply it on two combinatorial problems: ONEMAX and the multi-modal NMAX.
Considering three different network models we investigate the relationships
between their features, algorithm's convergence and its ability to find
multiple optima (for the multi-modal problem). In order to perform a deeper
analysis we investigate the introduction of weighted graphs with time-varying
weights. The results show that networks with a large Average Path Length lead
to an higher number of optima and a consequent slow exploration dynamics (i.e.
low First Hitting Time). Furthermore, the introduction of weighted networks
shows the possibility to tune algorithm's dynamics during its execution with
the parameter related with weights' change. This work gives a first answer
about the effects of various graph topologies on the diversity of evolutionary
algorithms and it describes a simple but powerful algorithmic framework which
allows to investigate many aspects of ssEAs dynamics.

theoretical models used to describe the emission of radiation by relativistic
electrons as a continuous diffusive process, and claimed that in the asymptotic
limit for a large number of undulator periods the evolution of the electron
energy distribution occurs as discrete energy groups according to Poisson
distribution. We show that these novel results have no physical sense, because
they are based on a one-dimensional model of spontaneous emission and assume
that electrons are sheets of charge. However, electrons are point-like
particles and, as is well-known, the bandwidth of the angular-integrated
spectrum of undulator radiation is independent of the number of undulator
periods. If we determine the evolution of the energy distribution using a
three-dimensional theory we find the well-known results consistent with a
continuous diffusive process. The additional pedagogical purpose of this paper

governed by so-called genetic regulatory networks (GRN). These networks capture
all possible features of cells and are responsible for the immense levels of
adaptation characteristic to living systems. At any point in time only small
subsets of these networks are active. Any active subset of the GRN leads to the
expression of particular sets of molecules (expression modes). The subsets of
active networks change over time, leading to the observed complex dynamics of
expression patterns. Understanding of this dynamics becomes increasingly
important in systems biology and medicine. While the importance of
transcription rates and catalytic interactions has been widely recognized in
modeling genetic regulatory systems, the understanding of the role of
degradation of biochemical agents (mRNA, protein) in regulatory dynamics
remains limited. Recent experimental data suggests that there exists a
functional relation between mRNA and protein decay rates and expression modes.
In this paper we propose a model for the dynamics of successions of sequences
of active subnetworks of the GRN. The model is able to reproduce key
characteristics of molecular dynamics, including homeostasis, multi-stability,
periodic dynamics, alternating activity, differentiability, and self-organized
critical dynamics. Moreover the model allows to naturally understand the
mechanism behind the relation between decay rates and expression modes. The
model explains recent experimental observations that decay-rates (or turnovers)
vary between differentiated tissue-classes at a general systemic level and
highlights the role of intracellular decay rate control mechanisms in cell
differentiation.

mapping of this problem to a Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid with one impurity whose
interaction parameter corresponds to the specific value K=1/2, allowing for a
refermionization procedure. The ""new"" fermions have an energy-dependent
transmission amplitude which incorporates the strong correlation effects and
yields the exact dc current and zero-frequency noise through expressions
similar to those of the scattering approach. We recall and discuss these
results for our present purpose. Then we compute, for the first time, the
finite-frequency differential conductance and the finite-frequency
non-symmetrized noise. Contrary to intuitive expectation, both cannot be
expressed within the scattering approach for the new fermions, even though they
are still determined by the transmission amplitude. Even more, the
finite-frequency conductance obeys an exact relation in terms of the dc current
which is similar to that derived perturbatively with respect to weak tunneling
within the Tien-Gordon theory, and extended recently to arbitrary strongly
interacting systems coupled eventually to an environment or/and with a
fractional charge. We also show that the emission excess noise vanishes exactly

probability distribution for functions. Examples include Bayesian nonparametric
statistics and conditioned diffusion processes. Standard MCMC algorithms
typically become arbitrarily slow under the mesh refinement dictated by
nonparametric description of the unknown function. We describe an approach to
modifying a whole range of MCMC methods, applicable whenever the target measure
has density with respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field
reference measure, which ensures that their speed of convergence is robust
under mesh refinement. Gaussian processes or random fields are fields whose
marginal distributions, when evaluated at any finite set of $N$ points, are
$\mathbb{R}^N$-valued Gaussians. The algorithmic approach that we describe is
applicable not only when the desired probability measure has density with
respect to a Gaussian process or Gaussian random field reference measure, but
also to some useful non-Gaussian reference measures constructed through random
truncation. In the applications of interest the data is often sparse and the
prior specification is an essential part of the overall modelling strategy.
These Gaussian-based reference measures are a very flexible modelling tool,
finding wide-ranging application. Examples are shown in density estimation,
data assimilation in fluid mechanics, subsurface geophysics and image
registration. The key design principle is to formulate the MCMC method so that
it is, in principle, applicable for functions; this may be achieved by use of
proposals based on carefully chosen time-discretizations of stochastic
dynamical systems which exactly preserve the Gaussian reference measure. Taking
this approach leads to many new algorithms which can be implemented via minor
modification of existing algorithms, yet which show enormous speed-up on a wide
range of applied problems.

with water described eitherexplicitly or through a mean-field approach. To
critically assess this hypothesis, we built a two-dimensional lattice model of
a protein in interaction with water molecules that can adopt a wide range of
conformations. This microscopic description of the solvent has been used
further to derive an effective model by averaging over all the degrees of
freedom of the solvent. At thermal equilbrium, the two descriptions are
rigourously equivalent, predicting the same folded conformation of the protein.
The model allows exact calculations of some relaxation properties using the
master equations associated to both solvent descriptions. The kinetic patterns
associated to the folding pathways are remarkably different. In this work we
demonstrate, that an effective description of the solvent can not described

describes correctly the microscopic routes, appears to be the only candidate to
study folding kinetics.

Magnetotransport data reveal clear evidence that the stray fields of domain

close to the transition temperature by the occurrence of peak-like features in

shows that the resistance peaks occur exactly at the magnetization reversal

  http://www.kashlinsky.info/bulkflows/physicsreport",,,,"astro-ph.CO gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this review we present a comprehensive discussion of peculiar velocity
field measured recently on very large scales with a novel method using X-ray
galaxy clusters as tracers. The measurement is based on the kinematic component
of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (KSZ) effect produced by Compton scattering of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) photons off the hot intracluster gas, and uses a
large catalog of X-ray selected clusters and all-sky CMB maps obtained with the
WMAP satellite. The method probes the dipole of the CMB temperature field
evaluated at the cluster positions and within the apertures in which the CMB
monopole contribution vanishes, thereby isolating the signal remaining from the
KSZ effect produced by coherently moving clusters. The detection of a highly
significant dipole out to the depth of at least ~ 800 Mpc casts doubt on the
notion that gravitational instability from the observed mass distribution is
the sole -- or even dominant -- cause of the detected motions. Rather it
appears that the flow may extend across the entire observable Universe.
Possible implications include the possibility to constrain the primeval
preinflationary structure of space-time and its landscape, and/or the need for
modifications of presently known physics (e.g. arising from a
higher-dimensional structure of gravity). We review these possibilities in
light of the measurements described here and specifically discuss the prospects
of future measurements and the issues they should resolve. We address the
consistency of these large-scale velocity measurements with those obtained on
smaller scales by studies using galaxies as tracers, and resolve the
discrepancies with two recent claims based on modified CMB analysis schemes.

the design presented in our Conceptual Design Report (CDR): an
electroluminescence time projection chamber, with separate readout planes for
calorimetry and tracking, located, respectively, behind cathode and anode. The
detector is designed to hold a maximum of about 150 kg of xenon at 15 bar, or

xenon-based detectors. Each individual PMT will be isolated from the gas by an
individual, pressure resistant enclosure and will be coupled to the sensitive
volume through a sapphire window. The tracking plane consists in an array of
Hamamatsu S10362-11-050P MPPCs used as tracking pixels. They will be arranged
in square boards holding 64 sensors (8 times8) with a 1-cm pitch. The inner

and improve the quality of the CMB data products, by matching the unusual

Noting this, we have investigated the symmetry and antisymmetry of CMB

even and odd-parity respectively. The investigation on the parity of the recent

parametric tension. Besides anomalies explicitly associated with parity, there
are anomalous lack of large-scale correlation in CMB data. Noting the
equivalence between the power spectrum and the correlation, we have
investigated the association between the lack of large-angle correlation and

find that the odd-parity preference at low multipoles is, in fact,

Gram determinants, and inverse small 4-point Gram determinants are treated by
expansions in higher-dimensional 3-point functions. By exploiting sums over
signed minors, weighted with scalar products of chords (or, equivalently,
external momenta), extremely efficient expressions for tensor integrals
contracted with external momenta were derived. The evaluation of 7-point

it provides a description of the distribution of the random walk on long

These correlators, also known as the noise kernels, give the fluctuations of

investigation of the physical effects of negative energy density in certain

stochastic-mean-field theory for large systems we analyze static disorder of
the characteristic parameters of the system and explore the ground state
induced statistics. We report on a variety of glassy phases deriving from the
hybrid statistics of the system. On-site strong disorder induces insulating
behavior through two different mechanisms. For disorder in the light-matter
detuning, low energy cavities dominate the statistics allowing the excitations
to localize and bunch in such cavities. In the case of disorder in the light-
matter coupling, sites with strong coupling between light and matter become
very significant, which enhances the Mott-like insulating behavior. Inter-site
(hopping) disorder induces fluidity and the dominant sites are strongly coupled
to each other.

scalar-tensor models of modified gravity where General Relativity is retrieved
locally thanks to a screening mechanism. We find that fermions have a modified
dispersion relation and would go faster than light in an anisotropic and
space-dependent way along the scalar field lines of force. Phenomenologically,
these models are tightly restricted by the amount of Cerenkov radiation emitted
by the superluminal particles, a constraint which is only satisfied by
chameleons. Measuring the speed of neutrinos emitted radially from the surface
of the earth and observed on the other side of the earth would probe the scalar
field profile of modified gravity models in dense environments. We argue that
the test of the equivalence principle provided by the Lunar ranging experiment
implies that a deviation from the speed of light, for natural values of the
coupling scale between the scalar field and fermions, would be below detectable
levels, unless gravity is modified by camouflaged chameleons where the field
normalisation is environmentally dependent.

emission from hydrogen-poor supernovae and apply this framework to SN2011fe
using Swift-XRT, UVOT and Chandra observations. We characterize the optical
properties of SN2011fe in the Swift bands and find them to be broadly
consistent with a ""normal"" SN Ia, however, no X-ray source is detected by
either XRT or Chandra. We constrain the progenitor system mass loss rate to be
lower than 2x10^-9 M_sun/yr (3sigma c.l.) for wind velocity v_w=100 km/s. Our
result rules out symbiotic binary progenitors for SN2011fe and argues against
Roche-lobe overflowing subgiants and main sequence secondary stars if >1% of
the transferred mass is lost at the Lagrangian points. Regardless of the
density profile, the X-ray non-detections are suggestive of a clean environment
(particle density < 150 cm-3) for (2x10^15<R<5x10^16) cm around the progenitor
site. This is either consistent with the bulk of material being confined within
the binary system or with a significant delay between mass loss and supernova
explosion. We furthermore combine X-ray and radio limits from Chomiuk et al.
2012 to constrain the post shock energy density in magnetic fields. Finally, we
searched for the shock breakout pulse using gamma-ray observations from the
Interplanetary Network and find no compelling evidence for a
supernova-associated burst. Based on the compact radius of the progenitor star
we estimate that the shock break out pulse was likely not detectable by current
satellites.

to external on-site perturbation is studied. Analytical procedure predicting
the evolution of the primary pulse is devised for the general form of the

is confirmed with several specific granular setups such as, chains mounted on
the nonlinear elastic foundation, chains perturbed by the dissipative forces as
well as randomly perturbed chains. Additional interesting finding made in the
present study corresponds to the chains subject to a special type of
perturbations including the terms leading to dissipation and those acting as an
energy source. It is shown in the study that application of such perturbation
may lead to formation of stable stationary shocks acting as attractors for the
initially unperturbed, propagating Nesterenko solitary waves. Interestingly
enough the developed analytical procedure provides an extremely close

zones of their stability. In conclusion we would like to stress that the
developed analytical model have demonstrated spectacular correspondence to the
results of direct numerical simulations for all the setups considered in the

a very weak coupling of the electrons to the ordered magnetic moments or strong
fluctuations. Furthermore, the FS does not change across the temperature (~
25K) where changes are observed in the Hall coefficient. Notably, the Fermi
surface deviates drastically from the usual FS of the superconducting

datasets in which the observations are described by paired high-dimensional
vectorial representations or ""views"". Some typical examples can be found in web
mining and genomics applications. In this article we present an algorithm for
data clustering with multiple views, Multi-View Predictive Partitioning (MVPP),
which relies on a novel criterion of predictive similarity between data points.
We assume that, within each cluster, the dependence between multivariate views
can be modelled by using a two-block partial least squares (TB-PLS) regression
model, which performs dimensionality reduction and is particularly suitable for
high-dimensional settings. The proposed MVPP algorithm partitions the data such
that the within-cluster predictive ability between views is maximised. The
proposed objective function depends on a measure of predictive influence of
points under the TB-PLS model which has been derived as an extension of the
PRESS statistic commonly used in ordinary least squares regression. Using
simulated data, we compare the performance of MVPP to that of competing
multi-view clustering methods which rely upon geometric structures of points,
but ignore the predictive relationship between the two views. State-of-art
results are obtained on benchmark web mining datasets.

of energy density $\rho_{B}$. The study is done here under the framework of
spatially homogeneous and anisotropic locally rotationally symmetric (LRS)
Bianchi-I cosmological model in the presence of magnetized dark energy. To get
the deterministic model of the Universe, we assume that the shear scalar
$(\sigma)$ in the model is proportional to expansion scalar $(\theta)$. This
condition leads to $A=B^{n}$, where $A$ and $B$ are metric functions and $n$ is
a positive constant giving the proportionality condition between shear and

Universe and the derived model is in good agreement with the recent
astrophysical observations. The physical behavior of the Universe has been
