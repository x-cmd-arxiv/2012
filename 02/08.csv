electropermeabilization affects the lateral mobility of Rae-1, a GPi anchored

  gamma-ray observations","7 pages, 6 figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energetic pulsars power winds of relativistic leptons which produce photon
nebulae (so- called pulsar wind nebulae, PWNe). Their spectral energy
distribution has a double-humped structure: the first hump lies in the X-ray
regime, the second in the gamma-ray range. The X-ray emission is generally
understood as synchrotron radiation by highly energetic leptons, the gamma-ray
emission as Inverse Compton scattering of energetic leptons with ambient photon
fields. The spectral evolution is influenced by the time-dependent spin-down of
the pulsar and the decrease of the magnetic field strength with time. Thus, the
present spectral appearance of a PWN depends on the age of the pulsar: while
young PWNe are bright in X-rays and gamma-rays, the X-ray emission of evolved
PWNe is suppressed. Hence, evolved pulsar wind nebulae may offer an explanation
of the nature of some of the unidentified VHE (very high-energy, E > 100GeV)
gamma-ray sources not yet associated with a counterpart at other wavelengths.
The purpose of this work is to develop a model which allows to calculate the
expected X-ray fluxes of unidentified VHE gamma-ray sources considered to be
PWN candidates. Such an estimate may help to evaluate the prospects of
detecting the X-ray signal in deep observations with current X-ray
observatories in future studies. We present a time-dependent leptonic model
which predicts the broad-band emission of a PWN according to the
characteristics of its pulsar. For a sample of representative PWNe, the
resulting model predictions in the X-ray and gamma-ray range are compared to
observations. The comparison shows that the energy flux of the X-ray emission
of identified PWNe from different states of evolution can be roughly predicted
by the model. This implies the possibility of an estimate of the non-thermal
X-ray emission of unidentified VHE gamma-ray sources in case of an evolved PWN
scenario.

Apart
from low operational overhead, a highly attractive property of CHOKe is that it
can protect responsive TCP flows from unresponsive UDP flows. Particularly,
previous works have proven that CHOKe is able to bound both bandwidth share and
buffer share of (a possible aggregate) UDP traffic (flow) on a link. However,
these studies consider, and pertain only to, a steady state where the queue
reaches equilibrium in the presence of many (long-lived) TCP flows and an
unresponsive UDP flow of fixed arrival rate. If the steady state conditions are
perturbed, particularly when UDP traffic rate changes over time, it is unclear
whether the protection property of CHOKe still holds. Indeed, it can be
examined, for example, that when UDP rate suddenly becomes 0 (i.e., flow
stops), the unresponsive flow may assume close to full utilization in sub-RTT
scales, potentially starving out the TCP flows. To explain this apparent
discrepancy, this paper investigates CHOKe queue properties in a transient
regime, which is the time period of transition between two steady states of the
queue, initiated when the rate of the unresponsive flow changes. Explicit
expressions that characterize flow throughputs in transient regimes are
derived. These results provide additional understanding of CHOKe, and give some
explanation on its intriguing behavior in the transient regime.

feedback identifying the first symbol at which decoding is successful allows
capacity to be approached with surprisingly low latency. This paper uses Chen's
rate-compatible sphere-packing (RCSP) analysis to study what happens when
symbols must be transmitted in packets, as with a traditional hybrid ARQ
system, and limited to relatively few (six or fewer) incremental transmissions.
  Numerical optimizations find the series of progressively growing cumulative
block lengths that enable RCSP to approach capacity with the minimum possible
latency. RCSP analysis shows that five incremental transmissions are sufficient
to achieve 92% of capacity with an average block length of fewer than 101
symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB.
  The RCSP analysis provides a decoding error trajectory that specifies the
decoding error rate for each cumulative block length. Though RCSP is an
idealization, an example tail-biting convolutional code matches the RCSP
decoding error trajectory and achieves 91% of capacity with an average block
length of 102 symbols on the AWGN channel with SNR of 2.0 dB. We also show how
RCSP analysis can be used in cases where packets have deadlines associated with
them (leading to an outage probability).

induced by a transverse field are found to be unable to lift this degeneracy in
favor of a classically ordered state at the harmonic level. This remarkable
fact suggests that a quantum-disordered ground state can be instead promoted
when non-linear fluctuations are accounted for, in agreement with existing
results for the isotropic case J1=J2. Moreover spin-wave theory shows sizable
regions of instability which are further candidates for quantum-disordered

Providers (CPs) such as content distribution networks and hyper-giants. To cope
with the increasing demand for content, CPs deploy massively distributed
infrastructures. This poses new challenges for CPs as they have to dynamically
map end-users to appropriate servers, without being fully aware of network
conditions within an ISP as well as the end-users network locations.
Furthermore, ISPs struggle to cope with rapid traffic shifts caused by the
dynamic server selection process of CPs.
  In this paper, we argue that the challenges that CPs and ISPs face separately
today can be turned into an opportunity. We show how they can jointly take
advantage of the deployed distributed infrastructures to improve their
operation and end-user performance. We propose Content-aware Traffic
Engineering (CaTE), which dynamically adapts the traffic demand for content
hosted on CPs by utilizing ISP network information and end-user location during
the server selection process. As a result, CPs enhance their end-user to server
mapping and improve end-user experience, thanks to the ability of
network-informed server selection to circumvent network bottlenecks. In
addition, ISPs gain the ability to partially influence the traffic demands in
their networks. Our results with operational data show improvements in path
length and delay between end-user and the assigned CP server, network wide
traffic reduction of up to 15%, and a decrease in ISP link utilization of up to
40% when applying CaTE to traffic delivered by a small number of major CPs.

First, we construct a natural metric for the spaces on which Zariski product

is invariant under a gauge transformation generated by the Zariski quantized

We also find that pair creations and annihilations occur among the many bodies

imply that the Zariski quantization is a second quantization. Moreover, the
Zariski quantization preserves supersymmetries of the first quantized field

expected to couple to other fields. We consider a model with a dilaton-like
coupling between a U(1) gauge field and a scalar inflaton. We show that this
coupling can result in observable non-gaussianity, even in the conventional
regime where inflation is supported by a single scalar slowly rolling on a
smooth potential: the time dependent inflaton condensate leads to amplification
of the large-scale gauge field fluctuations, which can feed-back into the
scalar/tensor cosmological perturbations. In the squeezed limit, the resulting
bispectrum is close to the local one, but it shows a sizable and characteristic
quadrupolar dependence on the angle between the shorter and the larger modes in
the correlation. Observable non-gaussianity is obtained in a regime where
perturbation theory is under control. If the gauge field is identified with the
electromagnetic field, the model that we study is a realization of the
magnetogenesis idea originally proposed by Ratra, and widely studied. This
identification (which is not necessary for the non-gaussianity production) is
however problematic in light of a strong coupling problem already noted in the

macroscopic behavior of complex systems in terms of the underlying statistical

geometrodynamical approach to chaos (IGAC) on statistical manifolds. Special
focus is devoted to the description of the roles played by the sectional
curvature, the Jacobi field intensity and the information geometrodynamical

arbitrary chaotic and regular systems defined on the statistical manifold.
Finally, the application of such information geometric techniques to several

the time delay of the wave $\tau$ is linked to its transverse spatial shift
$\Delta x$ through the simple relationship $\Delta x = c\tau \cot\theta$, where

mechanism that could affect the shape of the CMB angular fluctuations at those

the previous constraints on variations of {\alpha}, with {\alpha}/{\alpha}0 =
0.984 \pm 0.005, i.e. hinting also to a more than two standard deviation from
the current, local, value {\alpha}0. A significant degeneracy is present
between {\alpha} and Neff, and when variations in the latter are allowed the
constraints on {\alpha} are relaxed and again consistent with the standard
value. Deviations of either parameter from their standard values would imply
the presence of new, currently unknown physics.

correction method is somewhat expensive, our experiments show that in some

convex objective functions, we provide computational results to indicate that
the detection and correction mechanisms may also hold promise for nonconvex

(SDOs) and detached objects, in terms of their size, albedo, and thermal
properties. Thermal flux measurements obtained with the Herschel-PACS
instrument at 70, 100 and 160 \mu m, and whenever applicable, with Spitzer-MIPS
at 24 and 70 \mu m, are modeled with radiometric techniques, in order to derive
the objects' individual size, albedo and when possible beaming factor. Error
bars are obtained from a Monte-Carlo approach. We look for correlations between
these and other physical and orbital parameters. Diameters obtained for our
sample range from 100 to 2400 km, and the geometric albedos (in V band) vary
from 3.8 % to 84.5 %. The unweighted mean V geometric albedo for the whole
sample is 11.2 % (excluding Eris); 6.9 % for the SDOs, and 17.0 % for the
detached objects (excluding Eris). We obtain new bulk densities for three
binary systems: Ceto/Phorcys, Typhon/Echidna and Eris/Dysnomia. Apart from
correlations clearly due to observational bias, we find significant
correlations between albedo and diameter (more reflective objects being
bigger), and between albedo, diameter and perihelion distance (brighter and
bigger objects having larger perihelia). We discuss possible explanations for
these correlations.

problems which extend the classic Wyner-Ziv and Gel'fand-Pinsker problems are
considered. Inspired by applications in sensor networking and control, we first
consider lossy source coding with two-sided partial side information where the
quality/availability of the side information can be influenced by a
cost-constrained action sequence. A decoder reconstructs a source sequence
subject to the distortion constraint, and at the same time, an encoder is
additionally required to be able to estimate the decoder's reconstruction.
Next, we consider the channel coding ""dual"" where the channel state is assumed
to depend on the action sequence, and the decoder is required to decode both
the transmitted message and channel input reliably. Implications on the
fundamental limits of communication in discrete memoryless systems due to the
additional reconstruction constraints are investigated. Single-letter
expressions for the rate-distortion-cost function and channel capacity for the
respective source and channel coding problems are derived. The dual relation
between the two problems is discussed. Additionally, based on the two-stage
coding structure and the additional reconstruction constraint of the channel
coding problem, we discuss and give an interpretation of the two-stage coding
condition which appears in the channel capacity expression. Besides the rate
constraint on the message, this condition is a necessary and sufficient
condition for reliable transmission of the channel input sequence over the
channel in our ""two-stage"" communication problem. It is also shown in one
example that there exists a case where the two-stage coding condition can be
active in computing the capacity, and it thus can actively restrict the set of
capacity achieving input distributions.

later, Gribov discovered that the gauge fixing was not complete, gauge copies
called Gribov copies were still present and could affect the infrared region of
quantities like the gauge dependent gluon and ghost propagator. This feature
was often in literature related to confinement. Some years later, the
semi-classical approach of Gribov was generalized to all orders and the
so-called GZ action was born. Ever since, many related articles were published.
This review tends to give a pedagogic review of the ideas of Gribov and the
subsequent construction of the GZ action, including many other toipics related
to the Gribov region. It is shown how the GZ action can be viewed as a
non-perturbative tool which has relations with other approaches towards
confinement. Many different features related to the GZ action shall be
discussed in detail, such as BRST breaking, the KO criterion, the propagators,
etc. We shall also compare with the lattice data and other non-perturbative
approaches, including stochastic quantization.

three-dimensional atomic Fermi gases at zero temperature with a spherical
spin-orbit coupling which can be generated by a synthetic non-Abelian gauge
field coupled to neutral fermions. Our investigations are based on the path
integral formalism which is a powerful theoretical scheme for the study of the
properties of the bound state, the superfluid ground state, and the collective
excitations in the BCS-BEC crossover. At large spin-orbit coupling, the system
enters the BEC state of a novel type of bound state (referred to as rashbon)
which possesses a non-trivial effective mass. Analytical results and
interesting universal behaviors for various physical quantities at large
spin-orbit coupling are obtained. Our theoretical predictions can be tested in
future experiments of cold Fermi gases with three-dimensional spherical
spin-orbit coupling.

obeys a power law for large vertex degrees. Models constructed to explain this
phenomena have relied on preferential attachment where the networks grow by the
addition of both vertices and edges, and the edges attach themselves to a
vertex with a probability proportional to its degree. Simulations hint, though
not conclusively, that both growth and preferential attachment are necessary
for scale free behavior. We derive analytic expressions for degree
distributions for networks that grow by the addition of edges to a fixed number
of vertices, based on both linear and non-linear preferential attachment, and
show that they fall off exponentially as would be expected for purely random
networks. From this we conclude that preferential attachment alone might be

classical cluster-exhibiting random graph model that has been extensively
studied in statistics, physics, and computer science. In its simplest form, the
planted partition model is a model for random graphs on $n$ nodes with two
equal-sized clusters, with an between-class edge probability of $q$ and a
within-class edge probability of $p$. Although most of the literature on this
model has focused on the case of increasing degrees (ie.\ $pn, qn \to \infty$
as $n \to \infty$), the sparse case $p, q = O(1/n)$ is interesting both from a
mathematical and an applied point of view.
  A striking conjecture of Decelle, Krzkala, Moore and Zdeborov\'a based on
deep, non-rigorous ideas from statistical physics gave a precise prediction for
the algorithmic threshold of clustering in the sparse planted partition model.
In particular, if $p = a/n$ and $q = b/n$, then Decelle et al.\ conjectured
that it is possible to cluster in a way correlated with the true partition if
$(a - b)^2 > 2(a + b)$, and impossible if $(a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)$. By
comparison, the best-known rigorous result is that of Coja-Oghlan, who showed
that clustering is possible if $(a - b)^2 > C (a + b)$ for some sufficiently
large $C$.
  We prove half of their prediction, showing that it is indeed impossible to
cluster if $(a - b)^2 < 2(a + b)$. Furthermore we show that it is impossible
even to estimate the model parameters from the graph when $(a - b)^2 < 2(a +
b)$; on the other hand, we provide a simple and efficient algorithm for
estimating $a$ and $b$ when $(a - b)^2 > 2(a + b)$. Following Decelle et al,
our work establishes a rigorous connection between the clustering problem,
spin-glass models on the Bethe lattice and the so called reconstruction
problem. This connection points to fascinating applications and open problems.

limits from the CMS \alpha_T analysis of 1.1/fb of integrated luminosity, the
current direct detection dark matter limit from XENON100, as well as recent
experimental constraints on \gamma-ray fluxes from dwarf spheroidal satellite
galaxies of the Milky Way from the FermiLAT telescope, in addition to updating
values for other non-LHC experimental constraints. We extend the range of
scanned parameters to include a significant fraction of the focus
point/hyperbolic branch region. While we confirm earlier conclusions that at
present LHC limits provide the strongest constraints on the model's parameters,
we also find that when the uncertainties are not treated in an excessively
conservative way, the new bounds from dwarf spheroidal have the power to
significantly constrain the focus point/hyperbolic branch region. Their effect
is then comparable, if not stronger, to that from XENON100. We further analyze
the effects of one-year projected sensitivities on the neutrino flux from the
Sun in the 86-string IceCube+DeepCore configuration at the South Pole. We show
that data on neutrinos from the Sun, expected for the next few months at
IceCube and DeepCore, have the potential to further constrain the same region
of parameter space independently of the LHC and can yield additional
investigating power for the model.

which is proportional to the beta function of the theory. However, there are in
general many definitions of gauge couplings depending on renormalization
schemes, and hence many beta functions. In particular, N=1 supersymmetric pure
Yang-Mills has the holomorphic gauge coupling whose beta function is one-loop
exact, and the canonical gauge coupling whose beta function is given by the
Novikov-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov beta function. In this paper, we study
which beta function should appear in the trace anomaly in N=1 pure Yang-Mills.
We calculate the trace anomaly by employing the N=4 regularization of N=1 pure
Yang-Mills. It is shown that the trace anomaly is given by one-loop exact form
if the composite operator appearing in the trace anomaly is renormalized in a
preferred way. This result gives the simplest resolution to the anomaly puzzle
in N=1 pure Yang-Mills. The most important point is to examine in which scheme
the quantum action principle is valid, which is crucial in the derivation of
the trace anomaly.

Wolf-Rayet star. 400 ks observations of WR 6 by the XMM-Newton-telescope
resulted in a superb quality high-resolution X-ray spectrum. Spectral analysis
reveals that the X-rays originate far out in the stellar wind, more than 30
stellar radii from the photosphere, and thus outside the wind acceleration zone
where the line-driving instability could create shocks. The X-ray emitting
plasma reaches temperatures up to 50\,MK, and is embedded within the
un-shocked, ""cool"" stellar wind as revealed by characteristic spectral
signatures. We detect a fluorescent Fe line at approx 6.4 keV. The presence of
fluorescence is consistent with a two-component medium, where the cool wind is
permeated with the hot X-ray emitting plasma. The wind must have a very porous
structure to allow the observed amount of X-rays to escape. We find that
neither the line-driving instability nor any alternative binary scenario can

mass loss on the inner structure of large galactic dark matter haloes. This
mass expulsion is intended to mimic both the supernovae and AGN feedbacks, as
well as the evolution of stellar populations. This study is meant in particular
for precursors of massive Early Type Galaxies, wherein strong AGN feedback
(often dubbed ""QSO mode"" in galaxy formation models) has been proposed to
remove on a short timescale, of the order of a few dynamical times, a
substantial fraction of their baryons. In a previous paper we evaluated the
observational consequences (size increase) of this process on the galactic
structure (Ragone-Figueroa & Granato 2011). Here we focus on the distribution
of dark matter in the galactic region. It is shown that the inner region of the
DM halo expands and its density profile flattens by a sizeable amount, with
little dependence on the expulsion timescale. We also evaluate the effect of
the commonly made approximation of treating the baryonic component as a
potential that changes in intensity without any variation in shape. This
approximation leads to some underestimates of the halo expansion and its slope
flattening. We conclude that cuspy density profiles in ETGs could be difficult
to reconcile with an effective AGN (or stellar) feedback during the evolution
of these systems.

of black hole accretion discs contributes negligibly to the disc's overall
spectrum, i.e. the plunging fluid is swallowed by the black hole before it has
time to radiate. In the standard disc model used to fit X-ray observations of
accretion discs, the plunging region is assumed to be perfectly dark. However,
numerical simulations that include the full physics of the magnetized flow
predict that a small fraction of the disc's total luminosity emanates from the
plunging region. We investigate the observational consequences of this
neglected inner light. We compute radiative transfer based disc spectra that
correspond to 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulated discs
(which produce light inside their plunging regions). In the context of black
hole spin estimation, we find that the neglected inner light only has a modest
effect (this bias is less than typical observational systematic errors). For
rapidly spinning black holes, we find that the combined emission from the
plunging region produces a weak power-law tail at high energies. This indicates
that infalling matter is the origin for some of the `coronal' emission observed
in the thermal dominant and steep power-law states of X-ray binaries.

Our main results are as follows: We confirm the crossover to asymptotic

rather than being the one of the pure system. Furthermore, we find that the

the nebula RCW 78 around WR 55 is presented. Aims: The aim of this work is to
investigate the spatial distribution, physical characteristics, and kinematical
properties of the molecular gas linked to the galactic nebula RCW 78 to achieve
a better understanding of its interaction with the star and with the ionized
gas. Methods: This study was based on 12CO(1-0) fully sampled observations of a
region of ~0.45{\deg} in size around the star WR 55 and the nebula RCW 78
obtained with the 4-m NANTEN telescope, radio continuum archival data at 1.4
and 4.85 GHz, obtained from SGPS and PMNRAO Southern Radio Survey,
respectively, and available infrared MIPSGAL images at 24 microns. Results: A
molecular gas component in the velocity range from ~ -58 to -45 km s-1,
compatible with the velocity of the ionized gas, was found to be associated
with the optical nebula. Adopting a distance of ~ 5 kpc, the mass of this
molecular component is about 3.4 x 10^4 Msun. The analysis of the molecular
data revealed the presence of a velocity gradient, in agreement with the Halpha
line. New radiocontinuum flux density determinations confirm the thermal nature
of RCW 78. This indicates that the ionized gas in RCW 78 arises from
photoionization of the molecular gas component in the velocity range from -58
km s-1 to -45 km s-1. A molecular concentration at a velocity of -56.1 km s-1
(identified as C1) is very likely associated with the star HD 117797 and with a
collection of candidate YSOs, lying at a distance of 3.9 kpc, while the rest of
the molecular gas at velocities between -56 and -46 km s-1 constitute an
incomplete ring-like structure which expands around WR 55 at a velocity of
about ~ 5 km s-1. Mechanical energy and time requirements indicate that WR 55
is very capable of sustaining the expansion of the nebula.

stellar fluxes are relatively constant; stellar variability does not appear to
drive the large changes in the infrared fluxes. Based on our near-infrared

are variable in most of the evolved disks but the overall rates are probably
too small to cause the infrared variability. We discuss other possible physical
causes for the variability, including the influence of a companion, magnetic

reasons for some disagreement between calculation results and shielding
benchmark data taken at high energy accelerator facilities, since it is

using a 120 GeV proton beam of 3E5 protons/spill. Since the spill duration was
4 seconds, proton-induced events were counted pulse by pulse. The intensity was
maintained using diffusers and collimators installed in the beam line to MTBF.
The protons hit a copper block target the size of which is 5cm x 5cm x 60 cm
long. The neutrons produced in the target were measured using NE213 liquid
scintillator detectors, placed about 5.5 m away from the target at 30^{\circ}

determined by time-of-flight technique using timing difference between the
NE213 and a plastic scintillator located just before the target. Neutron
detection efficiency of NE213 was determined on basis of experimental data from
the high energy neutron beam line at Los Alamos National Laboratory. The
neutron spectrum was compared with the results of multi-particle transport
codes to validate the implemented theoretical models. The apparatus would be
applied to future measurements to obtain a systematic data set for secondary

eclipses, and a 58-hour near-continuous observation designed to detect the
planet's thermal phase curve. The results of our analysis are: (1) A mean
transit depth of 1.484% +/- 0.035%, consistent with previous measurements and
showing no evidence of variability in transit depth at the 3% level. (2) A mean
eclipse depth of 0.332% +/- 0.026%, somewhat higher than that previously
reported for this system; this new value brings observations into better
agreement with models. The dayside flux shows no evidence of variability at the
12% level. (3) Eclipses in the system occur 32 s +/- 129 s earlier than would
be expected from a circular orbit, which constrains the orbital quantity (e cos
omega) to be 0.00004 +/- 0.00033. This result is fully consistent with a
circular orbit and sets an upper limit of 140 m/s (3 sigma) on any
eccentricity-induced velocity offset during transit. The phase curve
observations (including one of the transits) exhibit an anomalous trend similar
to the detector ramp seen in previous Spitzer/IRAC observations; by modeling
this ramp we recover the system parameters. The photometry which follows the
ramp and transit exhibits a gradual, ~0.2% decrease in flux, similar to that
seen in pre-launch calibration data. The large uncertainties associated with
this poorly-understood, likely instrumental effect prevent us from usefully
constraining the planet's thermal phase curve. Our observations highlight the
need for a thorough understanding of detector-related instrumental effects on
long time scales when making the high-precision mid-infrared measurements

than expected for the objects' metallicities. We have carefully considered a

correlations between the size of the sulfur deficit and numerous nebular and
central star properties; (2) ionization correction factors which under-correct
for unobserved ions; (3) effects of dielectronic recombination on the sulfur

excessive destruction of S or production of O by AGB stars. It appears that all
but the second scenario can be ruled out. However, we find evidence that the
sulfur deficit is generally reduced but not eliminated when S^+3 abundances
determined directly from IR measurements are used in place of the customary

signal of a long-period companion. Following our previous work that studied the
correlation between activity cycles and long-term RV variations for K dwarfs we
now expand that research to the lower-end of the main sequence. Our objective
is to detect any correlations between long-term activity variations and the
observed RV of a sample of M dwarfs. We used a sample of 27 M-dwarfs with a
median observational timespan of 5.9 years. The cross-correlation function
(CCF) with its parameters RV, bisector inverse slope (BIS), full-width-at-half-
maximum (FWHM) and contrast have been computed from the HARPS spectrum. The
activity index have been derived using the Na I D doublet. These parameters
were compared with the activity level of the stars to search for correlations.
We detected RV variations up to ~5 m/s that we can attribute to activity cycle
effects. However, only 36% of the stars with long-term activity variability
appear to have their RV affected by magnetic cycles, on the typical timescale
of ~6 years. Therefore, we suggest a careful analysis of activity data when
searching for extrasolar planets using long-timespan RV data.

their data and computations to cloud computing services. These entities would,
however, like to ensure that the queries they request from the cloud services
are being computed correctly. In this paper, we use the principles of economics
and competition to vastly reduce the complexity of query verification on
outsourced data. We consider two cases: First, we consider the scenario where
multiple non-colluding data outsourcing services exist, and then we consider
the case where only a single outsourcing service exists. Using a game theoretic
model, we show that given the proper incentive structure, we can effectively
deter dishonest behavior on the part of the data outsourcing services with very
few computational and monetary resources. We prove that the incentive for an
outsourcing service to cheat can be reduced to zero. Finally, we show that a
simple verification method can achieve this reduction through extensive
experimental evaluation.

reduce the highly non-trivial problem of coding over continuous channels to a
much simpler discrete ones. More specifically, the focus is on the additive
exponential noise (AEN) channel, for which the (binary) expansion of the
(exponential) noise random variable is considered. It is shown that each of the
random variables in the expansion corresponds to independent Bernoulli random
variables. Thus, each of the expansion levels (of the underlying channel)
corresponds to a binary symmetric channel (BSC), and the coding problem is
reduced to coding over these parallel channels while satisfying the channel
input constraint. This optimization formulation is stated as the achievable
rate result, for which a specific choice of input distribution is shown to
achieve a rate which is arbitrarily close to the channel capacity in the high
SNR regime. Remarkably, the scheme allows for low-complexity capacity-achieving
codes for AEN channels, using the codes that are originally designed for BSCs.
Extensions to different channel models and applications to other coding
problems are discussed.

that mixed variational problems, and their numerical approximation by mixed

Hilbert complexes. This led to the development of the Finite Element Exterior
Calculus (FEEC) for a large class of linear elliptic problems. More recently,
Holst and Stern [Found. Comp. Math. 12:3 (2012), 263--293 and 363--387]
extended the FEEC framework to semi-linear problems, and to problems containing
variational crimes, allowing for the analysis and numerical approximation of
linear and nonlinear geometric elliptic partial differential equations on
Riemannian manifolds of arbitrary spatial dimension, generalizing surface
finite element approximation theory. In this article, we develop another
distinct extension to the FEEC, namely to parabolic and hyperbolic evolution
systems, allowing for the treatment of geometric and other evolution problems.
Our approach is to combine the recent work on the FEEC for elliptic problems
with a classical approach to solving evolution problems via semi-discrete
finite element methods, by viewing solutions to the evolution problem as lying
in time-parameterized Hilbert spaces (or Bochner spaces). Building on classical
approaches by Thomee for parabolic problems and Geveci for hyperbolic problems,
we establish a priori error estimates for Galerkin FEM approximation in the
natural parametrized Hilbert space norms. In particular, we recover the results
of Thomee and Geveci for two-dimensional domains and lowest-order mixed methods
as special cases, effectively extending their results to arbitrary spatial
dimension and to an entire family of mixed methods. We also show how the Holst
and Stern framework allows for extensions of these results to certain
semi-linear evolution problems.

existing data at mid-infrared to optical wavelengths, this allows us to screen
for the most luminous high-z objects, which are rare and thus require a survey
over a large field to be found. We introduce new color selection criteria to
select a z>7 sample with minimal contaminations from low-z galaxies and
Galactic cool stars; to reduce confusion in the relatively low angular
resolution IRAC images, we introduce a novel deconvolution method to measure
the IRAC fluxes of individual sources. Illustrating perhaps the effectiveness
at which we screen out interlopers, we find only one z>7 candidate, TENIS-ZD1.
The candidate has a weighted z_phot of 7.8, and its colors and luminosity
indicate a young (45M years old) starburst galaxy with a stellar mass of
3.2*10^10 M_sun. The result matches with the observational luminosity function
analysis and the semi-analytic simulation result based on the Millennium
Simulations, which may over predict the volume density for high-z massive
galaxies. The existence of TENIS-ZD1, if confirmed spectroscopically to be at
z>7, therefore poses a challenge to current theoretical models for how so much
mass can accumulate in a galaxy at such a high redshift.

QPP is consisting of millisecond timescale superfine structures. Each microwave
QPP pulse is made up of clusters of millisecond spike bursts or narrow band
type III bursts. There are three different frequency drift rates: global
frequency drift rate of microwave QPP pulse group, frequency drift rate of
microwave QPP pulse, and frequency drift rate of individual millisecond spikes
or type III bursts. The physical analysis indicates that the energetic
electrons accelerating from a large-scale highly dynamic magnetic reconnecting
current sheet above the flaring loop propagate downwards, impact on the flaring
plasma loop, and produce HXR bursts. The tearing-mode (TM) oscillations in the
current sheet modulate HXR emission and generate HXR QPP; the energetic
electrons propagating downwards produce Langmuir turbulence and plasma waves,
result in plasma emission. The modulation of TM oscillation on the plasma
emission in the current-carrying plasma loop may generate microwave QPP. The TM
instability produces magnetic islands in the loop. Each X-point will be a small
reconnection site and accelerate the ambient electrons. These accelerated
electrons impact on the ambient plasma and trigger the millisecond spike
clusters or the group of type III bursts. Possibly each millisecond spike burst

region. In this paper, however, we present an X-ray spectroscopic study of this
SNR using Suzaku, which is supportive of a Type Ia origin. Strong K-shell
emission from lowly ionized Fe has clearly been detected, and its origin is
determined, for the first time, to be the Fe-rich SN ejecta. The abundance
pattern is highly consistent with that expected for a somewhat-evolved Type Ia
SNR. It is suggested, therefore, that the X-ray point-like source CXOU
J170357.8-414302 located at the SNR's geometrical center is not associated with
the SNR but is likely to be a foreground object. Our result further indicates
that G344.7-0.1 is the first possible Type Ia SNR categorized as a member of
the so-called ""mixed-morphology"" class. In addition, we have detected emission
from He-like Al at ~1.6 keV, the first clear detection of this element in the
spectrum of an extended X-ray source. The possible enhancement of the Al/Mg
abundance ratio from the solar value suggests that the ambient interstellar
medium has a relatively high metallicity (not less than 10% of the solar
value), if this SNR has indeed a Type Ia origin. We also report marginal
detection of Cr and Mn, although the measured fluxes have large statistical and
systematic uncertainties.

(SNRs) with the Suzaku X-ray astronomy satellite. During SNR's evolution, the
expanding supernova ejecta and the ambient matter are compressed and heated by
the reverse and forward shocks to form an X-ray emitting hot plasma. Since
ionization proceeds slowly compared to shock heating, most young or middle-aged
SNRs have ionizing (underionized) plasmas. Owing to high sensitivity of Suzaku,
however, we have detected radiative recombination continua (RRCs) from the SNRs
IC 443, W49B, and G359.1-0.5. The presence of the strong RRC is the definitive
evidence that the plasma is recombining (overionized). As a possible origin of
the overionization, an interaction between the ejecta and dense circumstellar
matter is proposed; the highly ionized gas was made at the initial phase of the
SNR evolution in dense regions, and subsequent rapid adiabatic expansion caused
sudden cooling of the electrons. The analysis on the full X-ray band spectrum
of IC 443, which is newly presented in this paper, provides a consistent
picture with this scenario. We also comment on the implications from the fact
that all the SNRs having recombining plasmas are correlated with the

emission of low ionized Fe, possibly originating from supernova ejecta. We
revealed the global distribution of the Fe-rich plasma in the entire remnant,
for the first time; the Fe-K emission was clearly detected from the west,
north, and south regions, in addition to the X-ray brighter shells of southwest
and northeast, where the presence of the Fe-rich ejecta has already been
reported. The spectrum of each region is well represented by a three-component
model consisting of low- and high-temperature thermal plasmas and a non-thermal
emission. The lower-temperature component, with elemental abundances of near
the solar values, likely originates from the forward shocked interstellar
medium, while the Fe-rich ejecta is described by the hotter plasma. From the
morphologies of the forward and reverse shocks in the west region, the total
ejecta mass is estimated to be 1-2M_sun for the typical explosion energy of ~ 1
x 10^{51} erg. The integrated flux of the Fe-K emission from the entire SNR
roughly corresponds to a total Fe mass of about 1M_sun. Both of these estimates
suggest a Type Ia supernova origin of this SNR. We also find possible evidence
of an Fe-rich clump located beyond the forward-shock front in the north rim,
which is reminiscent of ejecta knots observed in the Tycho and Vela SNRs.

Fermi surface topology. A common origin of superconductivity is elucidated for
this compound and other high-T$_c$ materials. The spin excitations at
$(\pi,\pi/2)$ in superconducting states are observed, in good agreement with
the neutron scattering experiments. The spin resonance is indicated to show up
only for the d-wave pairing, which provides an additional indication for the

complex systems exist in a wide range of scientific disciplines. Time series
are typical experimental results we have about complex systems. In the analysis
of such time series, stationary situations have been extensively studied and
correlations have been found to be a very powerful tool. Yet most natural
processes are non-stationary. In particular, in times of crisis, accident or
trouble, stationarity is lost. As examples we may think of financial markets,
biological systems, reactors or the weather. In non-stationary situations
analysis becomes very difficult and noise is a severe problem. Following a
natural urge to search for order in the system, we endeavor to define states
through which systems pass and in which they remain for short times. Success in
this respect would allow to get a better understanding of the system and might
even lead to methods for controlling the system in more efficient ways.
  We here concentrate on financial markets because of the easy access we have
to good data and because of the strong non-stationary effects recently seen. We
analyze the S&P 500 stocks in the 19-year period 1992-2010. Here, we propose
such an above mentioned definition of state for a financial market and use it
to identify points of drastic change in the correlation structure. These points
are mapped to occurrences of financial crises. We find that a wide variety of
characteristic correlation structure patterns exist in the observation time
window, and that these characteristic correlation structure patterns can be
classified into several typical ""market states"". Using this classification we
recognize transitions between different market states. A similarity measure we
develop thus affords means of understanding changes in states and of
recognizing developments not previously seen.

trophotometric observations of various photodissociation regions, to
characterise this evolution. The aim of this paper is to trace the evolution of
dust grains in the Orion Bar photodissociation region. We use Herschel/PACS (70
and 160 mic) and SPIRE (250, 350 and 500 mic) together with Spitzer/IRAC
observations to map the spatial distribution of the dust populations across the
Bar. Brightness profiles are modelled using the DustEM model coupled with a
radiative transfer code. Thanks to Herschel, we are able to probe finely the
dust emission of the densest parts of the Orion Bar with a resolution from 5.6""
to 35.1"". These new observations allow us to infer the temperature of the
biggest grains at different positions in the Bar, which reveals a gradient from
\sim 80 K to 40 K coupled with an increase of the spectral emissivity index
from the ionization front to the densest regions. Combining Spitzer/IRAC
observations, which are sensitive to the dust emission from the surface, with
Herschel maps, we have been able to measure the Orion Bar emission from 3.6 to
500 mic. We find a stratification in the different dust components which can be
re- produced quantitatively by a simple radiative transfer model without dust
evolution. However including dust evolution is needed to explain the brightness
in each band. PAH abundance variations, or a combination of PAH abundance
variations with an emissivity enhancement of the biggest grains due to
coagulation give good results.

number of levels and lines involved. In the presence of a magnetic field, the
computation becomes even more difficult. The anomalous Zeeman pattern is a
superposition of many absorption or emission profiles with different Zeeman
relative strengths, shifts, widths, asymmetries and sharpnesses. We propose a
statistical approach to study the effect of a magnetic field on the broadening
of spectral lines and transition arrays in atomic spectra. In this model, the
sigma and pi profiles are described using the moments of the Zeeman components,
which depend on quantum numbers and Land\'{e} factors. A graphical calculation
of these moments, together with a statistical modeling of Zeeman profiles as
expansions in terms of Hermite polynomials are presented. It is shown that the
procedure is more efficient, in terms of convergence and validity range, than
the Taylor-series expansion in powers of the magnetic field which was suggested
in the past. Finally, a simple approximate method to estimate the contribution
of a magnetic field to the width of transition arrays is proposed. It relies on
our recently published recursive technique for the numbering of LS-terms of an

inhomogeneous indium tin oxide thin films have been investigated in a wide
temperature range 0.3--90 K. We found that the small-energy-transfer
electron-electron ($e$-$e$) scattering process dominated the dephasing from a
few K to several tens K. At higher temperatures, a crossover to the
large-energy-transfer $e$-$e$ scattering process was observed. Below about 1--2
K, the dephasing time $\tau_\varphi$ revealed a very weak temperature
dependence, which intriguingly scaled approximately with the inverse of the
electron diffusion constant $D$, i.e., $\tau_\varphi (T \approx 0.3 \, {\rm K})

why the electron-phonon relaxation rate is negligibly weak in this

The limit space and end space of an exterior space is used to construct the

lambda terms to their normal form is typically studied by reasoning on concrete
implementation algorithms. In this paper, we show that when head reduction is
the underlying dynamics, the unitary cost model is indeed invariant. This
improves on known results, which only deal with weak (call-by-value or
call-by-name) reduction. Invariance is proved by way of a linear calculus of
explicit substitutions, which allows to nicely decompose any head reduction
step in the lambda calculus into more elementary substitution steps, thus
making the combinatorics of head-reduction easier to reason about. The
technique is also a promising tool to attack what we see as the main open
problem, namely understanding for which normalizing strategies derivation
complexity is an invariant cost model, if any.

align the polarization from the far and near sides of the jet, leading to
increased polarization at longer wavelengths. Structural inhomogeneities of the
right type are naturally produced in helical magnetic fields and will also
appear in randomly tangled magnetic fields. We explore both alternatives and
find that, for random fields, the length scale for tangling cannot be too small
a fraction of the jet diameter and still be consistent with the relatively high
levels of fractional polarization observed in these features. We also find that
helical magnetic fields naturally produce transverse structure for inverse
depolarization which may be observable even in partially resolved jets.

whose continuum limit is known to be a Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with

ASM and study the statistics of the avalanche and wave frontiers for various
rates of dissipation. We examine the scaling behavior of a number of functions
such as the correlation length, the exponent of distribution function of loop
lengths and gyration radius defined for waves and avalanches. We find that they
do scale with the rate of dissipation. Two significant length scales are
observed. For length scales much smaller than the correlation length, these
curves show properties close to the critical curves and the corresponding
diffusivity parameter is nearly the same as the critical limit. We interpret
this as the ultra violet (UV) limit where $\kappa = 2$ corresponding to $c=-2$.
For length scales much larger than the correlation length we find that the
avalanche frontiers tend to Self-Avoiding Walk, the corresponding driving
function is proportional to the Brownian motion with the diffusion parameter
$\kappa =8/3$ corresponding to a field theory with $c = 0$. This is the infra

of a covariance matrix is still an open problem in statistics. Its solution is
of central importance in covariance estimation, particularly in the recent
high-dimensional data environment where enforcing the positive-definiteness
constraint could be computationally expensive. We provide a survey of the
progress made in modeling covariance matrices from two relatively complementary
perspectives: (1) generalized linear models (GLM) or parsimony and use of
covariates in low dimensions, and (2) regularization or sparsity for
high-dimensional data. An emerging, unifying and powerful trend in both
perspectives is that of reducing a covariance estimation problem to that of
estimating a sequence of regression problems. We point out several instances of
the regression-based formulation. A notable case is in sparse estimation of a
precision matrix or a Gaussian graphical model leading to the fast graphical
LASSO algorithm. Some advantages and limitations of the regression-based
Cholesky decomposition relative to the classical spectral (eigenvalue) and
variance-correlation decompositions are highlighted. The former provides an
unconstrained and statistically interpretable reparameterization, and
guarantees the positive-definiteness of the estimated covariance matrix. It
reduces the unintuitive task of covariance estimation to that of modeling a
sequence of regressions at the cost of imposing an a priori order among the
variables. Elementwise regularization of the sample covariance matrix such as
banding, tapering and thresholding has desirable asymptotic properties and the
sparse estimated covariance matrix is positive definite with probability
tending to one for large samples and dimensions.

nodes can communicate with each other without the use of infrastructure such as
access points or base stations. These networks are self-configuring, capable of
self-directed operation and hastily deployable. Nodes cooperate to provide
connectivity, operates without centralized administration. Nodes are itinerant,
topology can be very dynamic and nodes must be able to relay traffic since
communicating nodes might be out of range. The dynamic nature of MANET makes
network open to attacks and unreliability. Routing is always the most
significant part for any networks. Each node should not only work for itself,
but should be cooperative with other nodes. Node misbehaviour due to selfish or
malicious intention could significantly degrade the performance of MANET. The
Qos parameters like PDR, throughput and delay are affected directly due to such
misbehaving nodes. We focus on trust management framework, which is intended to
cope with misbehaviour problem of node and increase the performance of MANETs.
A trust-based system can be used to track this misbehaving of nodes, spot them
and isolate them from routing and provide reliability. In this paper a Trust
Based Reliable AODV [TBRAODV] protocol is presented which implements a trust
value for each node. For every node trust value is calculated and based trust
value nodes are allowed to participate in routing or else identified to become
a misbehaving node. This enhances reliability in AODV routing and results in
increase of PDR, decrease in delay and throughput is maintained. This work is
implemented and simulated on NS-2. Based on simulation results, the proposed
protocol provides more consistent and reliable data transfer compared with
general AODV, if there are misbehaving nodes in the MANET

progressively more incoherent interlayer tunneling and the pseudogap rapidly

WISE satellite data, we look for signs of enhanced mid-infrared scattering

formation activity associated with the cold clumps. The mapped clouds have
distances ranging from ~100pc to several kiloparsecs and cover a range of sizes
and masses from cores of less than 10 solar masses to clouds with masses in
excess of 10000 solar mass. Most fields contain some filamentary structures and
in about half of the cases a filament or a few filaments dominate the
morphology. In one case out of ten, the clouds show a cometary shape or have
sharp boundaries indicative of compression by an external force. The width of
the filaments is typically ~0.2-0.3pc. However, there is significant variation
from 0.1pc to 1pc and the estimates are sensitive to the methods used and the
very definition of a filament. Enhanced mid-infrared scattering, coreshine, was
detected in four clouds with six additional tentative detections. The cloud
LDN183 is included in our sample and remains the best example of this

transporting the hole around closed loops defined by metal gates deposited on
top of the nanodevice. The device exploits Dresselhaus spin orbit interaction
which translates the spatial motion of the hole into a rotation of the spin.
The proposed quantum gate operates on sub nanosecond time scales and requires
only the application of a weak static voltage which allows for addressing heavy

transformed into a sequence of linear time-invariant TPBVPs using the homotopy

$n^z \approx (1/3 - \frac{a}{2} -\frac{b}{4}) m + am^2+bm^3$, with $a \approx

$\Phi^z(\vec{r})$ is itself dominated by Fourier modes near the
antiferromagnetic wavevector in a universal way. On the analytical side, we
explore this question using spin-wave theory, a simple mean field model written
in terms of the total spin of each sublattice, and a rotor model for the
dynamics of $\vec{n}$. We find that spin-wave theory reproduces this
universality of $\Phi^z(\vec{r})$ and gives $n^z = (1-\alpha -\beta/S)m +
(\alpha/S)m^2 +{\mathcal O}(S^{-2})$ with $\alpha \approx 0.013$ and $\beta

field theory and the rotor model both give $n^z = 1/3 m$ for $S=1/2$

corresponding to two spin-1/2 quantum rotors. Several spin-spin correlators of
Bohm's hidden variables are analyzed numerically and a detailed comparison with
results obtained by standard quantum mechanics is outlined. In addition to
various expectation values the Bohm interpretation allows also a study of the
corresponding probability distributions, which enables a novel understanding of
entangled qubit dynamics. In particular, it is shown how the angular momenta of
two qubits in this formalism can be viewed geometrically and characterized by
their relative angles. For perfectly entangled pairs, for example, a compelling
picture is given, where the qubits exhibit a unison precession making a
constant angle between their angular momenta. It is also demonstrated that the
properties of standard quantum mechanical spin-spin correlators responsible for
the violation of Bell's inequalities are identical to their counterparts
emerging from the probability distributions obtained by the Bohmian approach.

white-matter fibre bundles between spatially segregated brain regions. The

using diffusion MRI in combination with probabilistic tractography.
Unfortunately, as of yet no approaches have been suggested that provide an
undisputed way of inferring brain networks from tractography. In this paper, we
provide a computational framework which we refer to as Bayesian connectomics.
Rather than applying an arbitrary threshold to obtain a single network, we
consider the posterior distribution of networks that are supported by the data,
combined with an exponential random graph (ERGM) prior that captures a priori
knowledge concerning the graph-theoretical properties of whole-brain networks.
We show that, on simulated probabilistic tractography data, our approach is
able to reconstruct whole-brain networks. In addition, our approach directly
supports multi-model data fusion and group-level network inference.

maps. We will analyze the correlation between the Faraday rotation map and the
CMB temperature map. The Faraday rotation map is dependent on the galactic
magnetic field, as well as the thermal electron density, and both may
contribute to the CMB temperature. We find that the standard deviation for the
mean cross correlation deviate from that of simulations at the 99.9% level.
Additionally, a comparison between the CMB temperature extrema and the extremum
points of the Faraday rotation is also performed, showing a general overlap
between the two. Also we find that the CMB Cold Spot is located at an area of
strong negative cross correlation, meaning that it may be explained by a
galactic origin. Further, we investigate nearby supernova remnants in the
galaxy, traced by the galactic radio loops. These super nova remnants are
located at high and low galactic latitude, and thus well outside the galactic

generalized to the full MOND regime. We prove that the Kuzmin property for
Newtonian gravity still holds, i.e., that the density distribution of separable
potentials is fully determined once the density profile along the minor axis is
assigned. At variance with the Newtonian case, the fact that a positive density
along the minor axis leads to a positive density everywhere remains unproven.
We also prove that (i) all regular separable models in MOND have a vanishing
density at the origin, so that they would correspond to centrally dark-matter
dominated systems in Newtonian gravity; (ii) triaxial separable potentials
regular at large radii and associated with finite total mass leads to density
distributions that at large radii are not spherical and decline as ln(r)/r^5;
(iii) when the triaxial potentials admit a genuine Frobenius expansion with
exponent 0<epsilon<1, the density distributions become spherical at large
radii, with the profile ln(r)/r^(3+2epsilon). After presenting a suite of
positive density distributions associated with MOND separable potentials, we
also consider the important family of (non-separable) triaxial potentials V_1
introduced by de Zeeuw and Pfenniger, and we show that, as already known for

H I (Lyman continuum), He I, and He II, with recombination edges at 91.2, 50.4,
and 22.8 nm, respectively. By fitting the wavelength ranges blue-ward of each
recombination edge with an exponential function, lightcurves of each of the
integrated continua were generated over the course of the flare, as well as
emission from the free-free continuum (6.5-37 nm). The He II 30.4 nm and
Lyman-alpha 121.6 nm lines, and soft X-ray (0.1-0.8 nm) emission from GOES are
also included for comparison. Each free-bound continuum was found to have a
rapid rise phase at the flare onset similar to that seen in the 25-50 keV
lightcurves from RHESSI, suggesting that they were formed by recombination with
free electrons in the chromosphere. However, the free-free emission exhibited a
slower rise phase seen also in the soft X-ray emission from GOES, implying a
predominantly coronal origin. By integrating over the entire flare the total
energy emitted via each process was determined. We find that the flare energy
in the EVE spectral range amounts to at most a few per cent of the total flare
energy, but EVE gives us a first comprehensive look at these diagnostically

emission lines during the impulsive phase of a C-class solar flare. In this
work, which utilizes data from the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard
Hinode, the broadened line profiles were observed to be co-spatial with the two
HXR footpoints as observed by RHESSI. By plotting the derived nonthermal
velocity for each pixel within the Fe XV and Fe XVI rasters against its
corresponding Doppler velocity a strong correlation (|r| > 0.59) was found
between the two parameters for one of the footpoints. This suggested that the
excess broadening at these temperatures is due to a superposition of flows
(turbulence), presumably as a result of chromospheric evaporation due to
nonthermal electrons. Also presented are diagnostics of electron densities
using five pairs of density-sensitive line ratios. Density maps derived using
the Mg XII and Si X line pairs showed no appreciable increase in electron
density at the footpoints, while the Fe XII, Fe XIII, and Fe XIV line pairs
revealed densities approaching 10^(11.5) cm^(-3). Using this information, the
nonthermal velocities derived from the widths of the two Fe XIV lines were
plotted against their corresponding density values derived from their ratio.
This showed that pixels with large nonthermal velocities were associated with
pixels of moderately higher densities. This suggests that nonthermal broadening
at these temperatures may have been due to enhanced densities at the
footpoints, although estimates of the amount of opacity broadening and pressure
broadening appeared to be negligible.

single-antenna Automatic Retransmission reQuest (ARQ) Z-interference channel
(ZIC). Specifically, we characterize the achievable three-dimensional tradeoff
between diversity (reliability), multiplexing (throughput), and delay (maximum
number of retransmissions) of two ARQ protocols: A non-cooperative protocol and
a cooperative one. Considering no cooperation exists, we study the achievable
tradeoff of the fixed-power split Han-Kobayashi (HK) approach. Interestingly,
we demonstrate that if the second user transmits the common part only of its
message in the event of its successful decoding and a decoding failure at the
first user, communication is improved over that achieved by keeping or stopping
the transmission of both the common and private messages. We obtain closed-form
expressions for the achievable tradeoff under the HK splitting. Under
cooperation, two special cases of the HK are considered for static and dynamic
decoders. The difference between the two decoders lies in the ability of the
latter to dynamically choose which HK special-case decoding to apply.
Cooperation is shown to dramatically increase the achievable first user
diversity.

Spitzer images, provide very valuable information, which nicely complement our
previous detailed rest-frame UV spectral analysis. From high-resolution HST

identify that the source is formed of two majors parts, the main galaxy
component and a smaller blob separated by 1.2 kpc in projected distance. The
blob, with a twice larger magnification factor, is resolved in the spectra. The
multi-Gaussian fitting of detected nebular emission lines and the spectral
energy distribution modeling of the available multi-wavelength photometry
provide the census of gaseous and stellar dust extinctions, gas-phase
metallicities, star-formation rates (SFRs), and stellar, gas, and dynamical
masses for both the main galaxy and the blob. As a result, the 8 o'clock arc
shows a marginal trend for a more attenuated ionized gas than stars, and
supports a dependence of the dust properties on the SFR. With a high specific
star-formation rate, SSFR = 33+/-19 Gyr^{-1}, this lensed Lyman-break galaxy
deviates from the mass-SFR relation, and is characterized by a young age of
40^{+25}_{-20} Myr and a high gas fraction of about 72%. The 8 o'clock arc
satisfies the fundamental mass, SFR, and metallicity relation, and favors that
it holds up beyond z~2.5. We believe that the blob, with a gas mass M_gas =
(2.2+/-0.9)x10^{9} Msun (one order of magnitude lower than the mass of the
galaxy), a half-light radius r1/2 = 0.53+/-0.05 kpc, a star-formation rate
SFR_Halpha = 33+/-19 Msun yr^{-1}, and in rotation around the main core of the
galaxy, is one of these star-forming clumps commonly observed in z>1

Added equation to Appendix 1",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Urban transportation systems grow over time as city populations grow and move
and their transportation needs evolve. Typical network growth models, such as
preferential attachment, grow the network node by node whereas rail and metro
systems grow by adding entire lines with all their nodes. The objective of this
paper is to see if any canonical regular network forms such as stars or grids
capture the growth patterns of urban metro systems for which we have historical
data in terms of old maps. Data from these maps reveal that the systems'
Pearson degree correlation grows increasingly from initially negative values
toward positive values over time and in some cases becomes decidedly positive.
We have derived closed form expressions for degree correlation and clustering
coefficient for a variety of canonical forms that might be similar to metro
systems. Of all those examined, only a few types patterned after a wide area
network (WAN) with a ""core-periphery"" structure show similar positive-trending
degree correlation as network size increases. This suggests that large metro
systems either are designed or evolve into the equivalent of message carriers
that seek to balance travel between arbitrary node-destination pairs with
avoidance of congestion in the central regions of the network.

calculate the relaxed geometries and vibrational modes of extended molecules
each consisting of one or two PDT molecules connecting two gold nanoclusters.
We formulate a perturbative theory of inelastic tunneling through molecules
bridging metal contacts in terms of elastic transmission amplitudes, and use
this theory to calculate the inelastic tunneling spectra of the gold-PDT-gold
extended molecules. We consider PDT molecules with both trans and gauche
conformations bound to the gold clusters at top, bridge and hollow bonding
sites. Comparing our results with the experimental data of Hihath et al. [Nano
Lett. 8, 1673 (2008)], we identify the most frequently realized conformation in
the experiment as that of trans molecules top-site bonded to both electrodes.
We find the switching from the 42 meV vibrational mode to the 46 meV mode
observed in the experiment to be due to the transition of trans molecules from
mixed top-bridge to pure top-site bonding geometries. Our results also indicate
that gauche molecular conformations and hollow site bonding did not contribute
significantly to the experimental inelastic tunneling spectra. For pairs of PDT
molecules connecting the gold electrodes in parallel we find total elastic
conductances close to twice those of single molecules bridging the contacts
with similar bonding conformations and small splittings of the vibrational mode
energies for the modes that are the most sensitive to the molecule-electrode
bonding geometries.
