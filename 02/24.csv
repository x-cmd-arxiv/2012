is generally nonintegrable unless a nontrivial constant of motion, in addition
to energy and angular momentum along the symmetry axis, exists. The Carter
constant in Kerr-de Sitter spacetime is the only example known to date.
Proposed astrophysical tests of the black-hole no-hair theorem have often
involved integrable gravitational fields more general than the Kerr family, but
the existence of such fields has been a matter of debate. To elucidate this
problem, we treat its Newtonian analogue by systematically searching for
nontrivial constants of motion polynomial in the momenta and obtain two
theorems.
  First, solving a set of quadratic integrability conditions, we establish the
existence and uniqueness of the family of stationary axisymmetric potentials
admitting a quadratic constant. As in Kerr-de Sitter spacetime, the mass
moments of this class satisfy a ""no-hair"" recursion relation $M_{2l+2}=a^2
M_{2l}$, and the constant is Noether-related to a second-order
Killing-St\""ackel tensor. Second, solving a new set of quartic integrability
conditions, we establish nonexistence of quartic constants. Remarkably, a
subset of these conditions is satisfied when the mass moments obey a
generalized ""no-hair"" recursion relation $M_{2l+4}=(a^2+b^2)M_{2l+2}-a^2b^2

satisfied nontrivially by any stationary axisymmetric vacuum potential.

(BBN) is more than a factor 2 larger than what has been observed in metal-poor
halo stars. Herein, we analyze the possibility that this discrepancy originates
from incorrect assumptions about the nuclear reaction cross sections relevant
for BBN. To do this, we introduce an efficient method to calculate the changes
in the 7Li abundance produced by arbitrary (temperature dependent)
modifications of the nuclear reaction rates. Then, considering that 7Li is
mainly produced from 7Be via the electron capture process 7Be + e -> 7Li +
nu_e, we assess the impact of the various channels of 7Be destruction.
Differently from previous analysis, we consider the role of unknown resonances
by using a complete formalism which takes into account the effect of Coulomb
and centrifugal barrier penetration and that does not rely on the use of the
narrow-resonance approximation. As a result of this, the possibility of a
nuclear physics solution to the 7Li problem is significantly suppressed. Given
the present experimental and theoretical constraints, it is unlikely that the
7Be + n destruction rate is underestimated by the 2.5 factor required to solve
the problem. We exclude, moreover, that resonant destruction in the channels
7Be + t and 7Be + 3He can explain the 7Li puzzle. New unknown resonances in 7Be
+ d and 7Be + alpha could potentially produce significant effects. Recent
experimental results have ruled out such a possibility for 7Be+d. On the other
hand, for the 7Be + alpha channel very favorable conditions are required. The
possible existence of a partially suitable resonant level in 11C is studied in
the framework of a coupled-channel model and the possibility of a direct
measurement is considered.

depositing alternating wafer-scale graphene sheets and thin insulating layers,
followed by patterning them all together into 3-dimensional

collective oscillation of Dirac fermions in such graphene superlattices is
unambiguously nonclassical: compared to doping single layer graphene,
distributing carriers into multiple graphene layers strongly enhances the
plasmonic resonance frequency and magnitude, which is fundamentally different
from that in a conventional semiconductor superlattice. This property allows us
to construct widely tunable far-infrared notch filters with 8.2 dB rejection

the entanglement of particle space-time trajectories can be obtained via the
topological braid entropy $\Sbraid$, which has previously been used to quantify
mixing efficiency in fluid systems. Here, we investigate the utility of
$\Sbraid$ in characterizing the dynamics of a dense, driven granular material
at packing densities near the static jamming point $\phi_J$. From particle
trajectories measured within a two-dimensional granular material, we typically
observe that $\Sbraid$ is well-defined and extensive. However, for systems
where $\phi \gtrsim 0.79$, we find that $\Sbraid$ (like $D$) is not
well-defined, signifying that these systems are not ergodic on the experimental
timescale. Both $\Sbraid$ and $D$ decrease with either increasing packing
density or confining pressure, independent of the applied boundary condition.
The related braiding factor provides a means to identify multi-particle
phenomena such as collective rearrangements. We discuss possible uses for this

was the first shape measurement challenge to include variable fields; both the
shear field and the Point Spread Function (PSF) vary across the images in a
realistic manner. The variable fields enable a variety of metrics that are
inaccessible to constant shear simulations including a direct measure of the
impact of shape measurement inaccuracies, and the impact of PSF size and
ellipticity, on the shear power spectrum. To assess the impact of shape
measurement bias for cosmic shear we present a general pseudo-Cl formalism,
that propagates spatially varying systematics in cosmic shear through to power
spectrum estimates. We also show how one-point estimators of bias can be
extracted from variable shear simulations. The GREAT10 Galaxy Challenge
received 95 submissions and saw a factor of 3 improvement in the accuracy
achieved by shape measurement methods. The best methods achieve sub-percent

processes. Acceleration in reconnection sites has attracted the attention of
researchers recently. In this letter we analyze the energy distribution
evolution of test particles injected in three dimensional (3D)
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of different magnetic reconnection
configurations. When considering a single Sweet-Parker topology, the particles
accelerate predominantly through a first-order Fermi process, as predicted in
previous work (de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian, 2005) and demonstrated
numerically in Kowal, de Gouveia Dal Pino & Lazarian (2011). When turbulence is
included within the current sheet, the acceleration rate, which depends on the
reconnection rate, is highly enhanced. This is because reconnection in the
presence of turbulence becomes fast and independent of resistivity (Lazarian &
Vishniac, 1999; Kowal et al., 2009) and allows the formation of a thick volume
filled with multiple simultaneously reconnecting magnetic fluxes. Charged
particles trapped within this volume suffer several head-on scatterings with
the contracting magnetic fluctuations, which significantly increase the
acceleration rate and results in a first-order Fermi process. For comparison,
we also tested acceleration in MHD turbulence, where particles suffer
collisions with approaching and receding magnetic irregularities, resulting in
a reduced acceleration rate. We argue that the dominant acceleration mechanism
approaches a second order Fermi process in this case.

Conjecture (2002), for every constraint satisfaction problem there exists a
generic semi-definite program that achieves the optimal approximation factor.
This result is existential as it does not provide an explicit optimal rounding
procedure nor does it allow to calculate exactly the Unique Games hardness of
the problem.
  Obtaining an explicit optimal approximation scheme and the corresponding
approximation factor is a difficult challenge for each specific approximation
problem. An approach for determining the exact approximation factor and the
corresponding optimal rounding was established in the analysis of MAX-CUT (KKMO
2004) and the use of the Invariance Principle (MOO 2005). However, this
approach crucially relies on results explicitly proving optimal partitions in
Gaussian space. Until recently, Borell's result (Borell 1985) was the only
non-trivial Gaussian partition result known.
  In this paper we derive the first explicit optimal approximation algorithm
and the corresponding approximation factor using a new result on Gaussian
partitions due to Isaksson and Mossel (2012). This Gaussian result allows us to
determine exactly the Unique Games Hardness of MAX-3-EQUAL. In particular, our
results show that Zwick algorithm for this problem achieves the optimal
approximation factor and prove that the approximation achieved by the algorithm
is $\approx 0.796$ as conjectured by Zwick.
  We further use the previously known optimal Gaussian partitions results to
obtain a new Unique Games Hardness factor for MAX-k-CSP : Using the well known
fact that jointly normal pairwise independent random variables are fully
independent, we show that the the UGC hardness of Max-k-CSP is $\frac{\lceil
(k+1)/2 \rceil}{2^{k-1}}$, improving on results of Austrin and Mossel (2009).

  Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study sequential coding of Markov sources under an error propagation
constraint. An encoder sequentially compresses a sequence of vector-sources
that are spatially i.i.d. but temporally correlated according to a first-order
Markov process. The channel erases up to B packets in a single burst, but
reveals all other packets to the destination. The destination is required to
reproduce all the source-vectors instantaneously and in a lossless manner,
except those sequences that occur in an error propagation window of length B +
W following the start of the erasure burst. We define the rate-recovery
function R(B, W) - the minimum achievable compression rate per source sample in
this framework - and develop upper and lower bounds on this function. Our upper
bound is obtained using a random binning technique, whereas our lower bound is
obtained by drawing connections to multi-terminal source coding. Our upper and
lower bounds coincide, yielding R(B, W), in some special cases. More generally,
both the upper and lower bounds equal the rate for predictive coding plus a
term that decreases as 1/(W+1), thus establishing a scaling behaviour of the
rate-recovery function. For a special class of semi-deterministic Markov
sources we propose a new optimal coding scheme: prospicient coding. An
extension of this coding technique to Gaussian sources is also developed. For
the class of symmetric Markov sources and memoryless encoders, we establish the

fluorocarbon leader material strength versus experimental tests of leaders
strength. Breaking strength of fishing line is the most common specification
when marketing fishing line. In this study, eight leaders rated near 15 pounds
by their manufacturers were tested. Each leader was tested with a knot in the
line and without a knot in the line. The strongest leader tested without a knot
was Cabela's Seaguar fluorocarbon and the weakest leader tested without a knot
was Cabela's Premier leader. The highest strength of leaders with a knot was
the Ande Monofilament Fluorocarbon and the lowest breaking strength of leaders
with a knot was the Seaguar Grand Max Fluorocarbon. Few published studies
actually test the breaking strength of a leader to determine the accuracy of
manufacturers' claims. Tensile strengths are also reported.

  Wireless Sensor Networks",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In distributed target tracking for wireless sensor networks, agreement on the
target state can be achieved by the construction and maintenance of a
communication path, in order to exchange information regarding local likelihood
functions. Such an approach lacks robustness to failures and is not easily
applicable to ad-hoc networks. To address this, several methods have been
proposed that allow agreement on the global likelihood through fully
distributed belief consensus (BC) algorithms, operating on local likelihoods in
distributed particle filtering (DPF). However, a unified comparison of the
convergence speed and communication cost has not been performed. In this paper,
we provide such a comparison and propose a novel BC algorithm based on belief
propagation (BP). According to our study, DPF based on metropolis belief
consensus (MBC) is the fastest in loopy graphs, while DPF based on BP consensus
is the fastest in tree graphs. Moreover, we found that BC-based DPF methods
have lower communication overhead than data flooding when the network is
sufficiently sparse.

probability distributions on the strictly positive integers. Assign
independently a random number of stubs (half-edges) to each red and blue point

translation-invariant schemes to match stubs between points of different colors
in order to obtain random bipartite graphs in which each point has a prescribed
degree distribution with law $\nu$ or $\mu$ depending on its color. Let $X$ and
$Y$ be random variables with law $\nu$ and $\mu$, respectively. For a large
class of point processes we show that we can obtain such translation-invariant
schemes matching a.s. all stubs if and only if \[ \lambda_{\mathcal{R}}
\mathbb{E}(X)= \lambda_{\mathcal{B}} \mathbb{E}(Y), \] allowing $\infty$ in
both sides, when both laws have infinite mean. Furthermore, we study a
particular scheme based on the Gale-Shapley stable marriage. For this scheme we
give sufficient conditions on $X$ and $Y$ for the presence and absence of
infinite components. These results are two-color versions of those obtained by

gravitationally lensed galaxies at 0.9<z<2.5 selected from a new, large sample
of strong lens systems in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7. We derive
stellar masses from the rest-frame UV to near-IR spectral energy distributions,
star formation rates (SFR) from the dust-corrected Ha flux, and metallicities
from the [N II]/Ha flux ratio. We combine the lensed galaxies with a sample of
sixty star-forming galaxies from the literature in the same redshift range for
which measurements of [N II]/Ha have been published. Due to the lensing
magnification, the lensed galaxies probe intrinsic stellar masses that are on
average a factor of 11 lower than have been studied so far at these redshifts.
They have specific star formation rates that are an order of magnitude higher
than seen for main-sequence star-forming galaxies at z~2. We measure an
evolution of 0.16+/-0.06 dex in the mass-metallicity relation between z~1.4 and
z~2.2. In contrast to previous claims, the redshift evolution is smaller at low
stellar masses. We do not see a correlation between metallicity and SFR at
fixed stellar mass. The combined sample is in general agreement with the local
fundamental relation between metallicity, stellar mass and SFR from Mannucci et
al. (2010, 2011). Using the Kennicutt-Schmidt law to infer gas fractions, we
investigate the importance of gas inflows and outflows on the shape of the
mass-metallicity relation using simple analytical models. This suggests that
the Maiolino et al.(2008) calibration of the [N II]/Ha flux ratio is biased
high. We conclude that both an absolute metallicity calibration and direct
measurements of the gas mass are needed to use the observed mass-metallicity
relation to gain insight into the impact of gas flows on the chemical evolution
of galaxies.

is red, r-Ks = 3.9 [AB], which the data presented here demonstrate is due to
ongoing dusty star formation. The overall lensing magnification (a factor of
17) facilitates observations from the blue optical through to 500micron, fully
capturing both the stellar photospheric emission as well as the re-processed
thermal dust emission. We also present optical and near-IR spectroscopy. These
extensive data show that this lensed galaxy is in many ways typical of
IR-detected sources at z~1, with both a total luminosity and size in accordance
with other (albeit much less detailed) measurements in samples of galaxies
observed in deep fields with the Spitzer telescope. Its far-infrared spectral
energy distribution is well-fit by local templates that are an order of
magnitude less luminous than the lensed galaxy; local templates of comparable
luminosity are too hot to fit. Its size (D~7kpc) is much larger than local
luminous infrared galaxies, but in line with sizes observed for such galaxies
at z~1. The star formation appears uniform across this spatial scale. In this
source, the luminosity of which is typical of sources that dominate the cosmic
infrared background, we find that star formation is spatially extended and well
organised, quite unlike the compact merger-driven starbursts which are typical
for sources of this luminosity at z~0.

characterized as a combination of a retrograde superrotating zonal wind (RSZ)
with a subsolar-to-antisolar flow (SSAS). Numerous mm-wave single-dish
observations have been obtained and could directly measure mesospheric
line-of-sight winds by mapping Doppler-shifts on CO rotational lines, but their
limited spatial resolution makes their interpretation difficult. By using
interferometric facilities, one can obtain better resolution on Doppler-shifts
maps, allowing in particular to put firmer constraints on the respective
contributions of the SSAS and RSZ circulations to the global mesospheric wind
field. We report on interferometric observations of the CO(1-0) line obtained
with the IRAM-Plateau de Bure interferometer in November 2007 and June 2009,
that could map the upper mesosphere dynamics on the morning hemisphere with a
very good spatial resolution (3.5-5.5""). All the obtained measurements show,
with a remarkably good temporal stability, that the wind globally flows in the
(sky) East-West direction, corresponding in the observed geometry either to an
unexpected prograde zonal wind or a SSAS flow. A very localized inversion of
the wind direction, that could correspond to a RSZ wind, is also repeatedly
detected in the night hemisphere. The presence of significant meridional winds
is not evidenced. Using models with different combinations of zonal and SSAS
winds, we find that the data is best reproduced by a dominant SSAS flow with a
maximal velocity at the terminator of ~200 m/s, displaying large diurnal and
latitudinal asymmetries, combined with an equatorial RSZ wind of 70-100 m/s,
overall indicating a wind-field structure consistent with but much more complex

tails and related structures following impulsive disturbances in galaxy
collisions. Since the epicyclic approximation is not valid for large radial
excursions, we use orbital equations of the form we call p-ellipses. These have
been shown to provide accurate representations of orbits in power-law halo
potentials. In the case of a purely tidal disturbance the resulting tidal tails
have simple structure. Scalings for their maximum lengths and other
characteristics as functions of the tidal amplitude and the exponent of the
power-law potentials are described. The analytic model shows that azimuthal
caustics (orbit crossing zones) are produced generically in these tails at a
fixed azimuth relative to the point of closest approach. Long tails, with high
order caustics at their base are also produced at larger amplitudes. The
analysis is extended to nonlinear disturbances and multiple encounters, which
break the symmetries of tidal perturbations. As the strength of the nonlinear
terms is varied the structure of the resulting forms varies from symmetric
tails to one-armed plumes. Cases with two or more impulse disturbances are also
considered as the simplest analytic models distinguishing between prograde and
retrograde encounters. A specific mechanism for the formation of tidal dwarf
galaxies at the end of tails is suggested as a consequence of resonance effects
in prolonged encounters. Qualitative comparisons to Arp Atlas systems suggest
that the limiting analytic cases are realized in real systems. We identify a
few Arp systems which may have swallowtail caustics, where dissipative gas
streams converge and trigger star formation. UV and optical images reveal
luminous knots of young stars at these 'hinge clump' locations.

motion of very distant extragalactic objects, such as quasars, galactic nuclei,
and QSOs. We use this term to identify a specific area of research, the
methodology of which differs from that of general astrometry. The main purpose
of quasometry is to link the sub-milliarcsecond radio frame (ICRF) with the
existing and emerging optical reference frames of similar accuracy, constructed
by astrometric satellites. Some of the main difficulties in achieving this goal
are discussed, e.g., the extended structures of quasar hosts, apparent motion
on the sky, optical variability, galactic companions, faintness. Besides the
strategic purpose, quasometry is undoubtedly useful for global astrometric
surveys, as it helps to verify or even correct the resulting reference frames.
There are two options of using measurements of distant quasars in a global
astrometric solution: 1) hard constraints embedded in the fabric of
observational equations; 2) {\it a posteriori} fitting of zonal errors. The
relative benefits and shortcoming of the two options are reviewed. A relatively
small set of about 200 carefully selected reference quasars can go a long way
in improving the astrometric value of a space mission, if they are sufficiently
bright, stable, fairly uniformly distributed on the sky, and are defining
sources in the ICRF. We present an ongoing program at the USNO to construct a
quality set of optical quasars with the required properties and to enhance the
ICRF with new sources in the areas where known, well-observed quasars are

condition: in a robot motion planning, a motion must be stasis if the initial

$\TC{B} = \TCM{B}$. While we still conjecture that Theorem 1.13 is true, this

show the difference between two invariants $\catBb{X}$ and $\catBB{X}$ is at
most 1 and the conjecture is true for some cases. We give further corrections

provide the opportunity to examine the entire maximum-light SN Ia
spectral-energy distribution. Since the UV region of a SN Ia spectrum is
extremely sensitive to the composition of the outer layers of the explosion,
which are transparent at longer wavelengths, this unprecedented spectrum can
provide strong constraints on the composition of the SN ejecta, and similarly
the SN explosion and progenitor system. SN 2011iv is spectroscopically normal,

compare SN 2011iv to other SNe Ia with UV spectra near maximum light and
examine trends between UV spectral properties, light-curve shape, and ejecta

different ejecta velocities have similar UV spectra, while those with similar
ejecta velocities but different light-curve shapes have very different UV
spectra. Through a comparison with explosion models, we find that both a

giant stars at mid-Galactic latitudes of (30$^{\circ}<|b|<60^{\circ}$),
designed to probe the properties of this population to distances of $\sim$9
kpc. Because M giants are generally metal-rich and we have limited
contamination from thin disk stars by the latitude selection, most of the stars
in the survey are expected to be members of the thick disk

  Here we report first results for 1799 stars. The distribution of radial
velocity (RV) as a function of l for these stars shows (1) the expected thick
disk population and (2) local metal-rich halo stars moving at high speeds
relative to the disk, that in some cases form distinct sequences in RV-$l$
space. High-resolution echelle spectra taken for 34 of these ""RV outliers""
reveal the following patterns across the [Ti/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane: seventeen of the
stars have abundances reminiscent of the populations present in dwarf
satellites of the Milky Way; eight have abundances coincident with those of the
Galactic disk and more metal-rich halo; and nine of the stars fall on the locus
defined by the majority of stars in the halo. The chemical abundance trends of
the RV outliers suggest that this sample consists predominantly of stars
accreted from infalling dwarf galaxies. A smaller fraction of stars in the RV
outlier sample may have been formed in the inner Galaxy and subsequently kicked
to higher eccentricity orbits, but the sample is not large enough to
distinguish conclusively between this interpretation and the alternative that
these stars represent the tail of the velocity distribution of the thick disk.
Our data do not rule out the possibility that a minority of the sample could
have formed from gas {\it in situ} on their current orbits.

features in velocity-space found in a survey of M giant stars and stellar
spatial inhomogeneities on global scales. Comparison to cosmological,
chemodynamical stellar halo models confirm that the M giant population is
particularly sensitive to rare, recent and massive accretion events. These
events can give rise to local observed velocity sequences - a signature of a
small fraction of debris from a common progenitor, passing at high velocity
through the survey volume, near the pericenters of their eccentric orbits. The
majority of the debris is found in much larger structures, whose morphologies
are more cloud-like than stream-like and which lie at the orbital apocenters.
Adopting this interpretation, the full-space motions represented by the
observed velocity features are derived under the assumption that the members
within each sequence share a common velocity. Orbit integrations are then used
to trace the past and future trajectories of these stars across the sky
revealing plausible associations with large, previously-discovered, cloud-like
structures. The connections made between nearby velocity structures and these
distant clouds represent preliminary steps towards developing coherent maps of
such giant debris systems. These maps promise to provide new insights into the
origin of debris clouds, new probes of Galactic history and structure, and new
constraints on the high-velocity tails of the local dark matter distribution
that are essential for interpreting direct detection experiments.

outlining the components of observing programs that can discover planets
orbiting stars predicted to make a close approach to a background star. If the
time and distance of closest approach can be well predicted, then the system
can be targeted for individual study. In most cases, however, the predictions
will be imprecise, yielding only a set of probable paths of approach and event
times. We must monitor an ensemble of such systems to ensure discovery, a
strategy possible with observing programs similar to a number of current
surveys, including PTF and Pan-STARRS; nova searches, including those conducted
by amateurs; ongoing lensing programs such as MOA and OGLE; as well as MEarth,
Kepler and other transit studies. If well designed, the monitoring programs
will be guaranteed to either discover planets in orbits with semi-major axes
smaller than about two Einstein radii, or else to rule out their presence.
Planets on wider orbits may not all be discovered, but if they are common, will
be found among the events generated by ensembles of potential lenses. We
consider the implications for VB 10, the first star to make a predicted
approach to a background star that is close enough to allow planets to be

hydrodynamic simulation that includes a heuristic prescription for quenching
star formation that yields a realistic passive galaxy population today. In this
prescription, halos dominated by hot gas are continually heated to prevent
their coronae from fueling new star formation. Hot coronae primarily form in
halos above \sim10^12 M\odot, so that galaxies with stellar masses \sim10^10.5
M\odot are the first to be quenched and move onto the red sequence at z > 2.
The red sequence is concurrently populated at low masses by satellite galaxies
in large halos that are starved of new fuel, resulting in a dip in passive
galaxy number densities around \sim10^10 M\odot. Stellar mass growth continues
for galaxies even after joining the red sequence, primarily through minor
mergers with a typical mass ratio \sim1:5. For the most massive systems, the
size growth implied by the distribution of merger mass ratios is typically
\sim2\times the corresponding mass growth, consistent with observations. This
model reproduces mass-density and colour-density trends in the local universe,
with essentially no evolution to z = 1, with the hint that such relations may
be washed out by z \sim 2. Simulated galaxies are increasingly likely to be red
at high masses or high local overdensities. In our model, the presence of
surrounding hot gas drives the trends with both mass and environment.

every year some foreground stars within a few hundred parsecs of Earth induce

events may exhibit evidence of planets orbiting the nearby star. In fact,
planets can even be discovered during relatively distant passages. Here, we
study the lensing signatures associated with planets orbiting nearby
high-proper-motion stars. We find the following. (1) Wide-orbit planets can be
detected for all distances of closest approach between the foreground and
background stars, potentially producing independent events long before and/or
after the closest approach. (2) Close-orbit planets can be detected for
intermediate distances of closest approach, producing quasiperiodic signatures
that may occur days or weeks before and after the stellar-lens event. (3)
Planets in the so-called 'zone for resonant lensing' can significantly increase
the magnification when the distance of closest approach is small, making the
stellar-lens event easier to detect, while simultaneously providing evidence
for planets. Because approaches close enough to allow planets to be detected
can be predicted, we can plan observing strategies to take advantage of the
theoretical framework built in this paper, which describes the sequence of
expected effects in terms of a sequence of detection regimes.

the dense, ram pressure stripped subcluster core and the first known example of
an upstream shock in the ICM (M=1.6+/-0.1). By measuring the electron
temperature profile behind each shock front, we determine the timescale for the
electron population to thermally equilibrate with the shock-heated ions. We
find that the temperature profile behind the bow shock is consistent with the
timescale for Coulomb collisional equilibration and the postshock temperature
is lower than expected for instant shock-heating of the electrons. Although
like the Bullet cluster the electron temperatures behind the upstream shock
front are hotter than expected, favouring the instant heating model, the
uncertainty on the temperature values is greater here and there is significant
substructure complicating the interpretation. We also measured the width of
each shock front and the contact discontinuity on the leading edge of the
subcluster core to investigate the suppression of transport processes in the
ICM. The upstream shock is ~440 kpc in length but appears remarkably narrow
over this distance with a best-fit width of only 6^{+5}_{-3} kpc compared with
the mean free path of 23+/-5 kpc. The leading edge of the subcluster core is
also narrow with an upper limit on the width of only 2 kpc separating the cool,
multiphase gas at 0.5-2 keV from the shock-heated surrounding ICM at ~6 keV.
The strong suppression of diffusion and conduction across this edge suggests a
magnetic draping layer may have formed around the subcluster core.[abridged]

invasion speed but decreases the population size of the invading species, and
can even inhibit the invasion process. Remarkably, however, the rate of
population increase, which quantifies the invasion efficiency, is maximized by
an optimal advection velocity. In models with Allee effect, differently from

increase in stimulus triggers an initial change in a biochemical or
physiological response, followed by a more gradual relaxation toward a basal,

acceptable bounds and allows organisms to readjust themselves to an optimum and
non-saturating sensitivity range when faced with a prolonged change in their
environment. Recently, it was shown theoretically and experimentally that many
adapting systems, both at the organism and single-cell level, enjoy a
remarkable additional feature: scale invariance, meaning that the initial,
transient behavior remains (approximately) the same even when the background
signal level is scaled. In this work, we set out to investigate under what
conditions a broadly used model of biochemical enzymatic networks will exhibit
scale-invariant behavior. An exhaustive computational study led us to discover
a new property of surprising simplicity and generality, uniform linearizations
with fast output (ULFO), whose validity we show is both necessary and
sufficient for scale invariance of enzymatic networks. Based on this study, we
go on to develop a mathematical explanation of how ULFO results in scale
invariance. Our work provides a surprisingly consistent, simple, and general

particles whose specific orbital energy is small compared to c^2 in the
Schwarzschild metric. For bound orbits the constraint of low energy is
equivalent to requiring the apoapsis of a particle to be large compared to the
Schwarzschild radius. Such low energy orbits are ubiquitous close to
supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei, but the potential is relevant in
any context containing particles on low energy orbits. Like the more complex
post-Newtonian expressions, the potential correctly reproduces the precession
in the far-field, but also correctly reproduces the position and magnitude of
the logarithmic divergence in precession for low angular momentum orbits. An
additional advantage lies in its simplicity, both in computation and
implementation. We also provide two simpler, but less accurate potentials, for
cases where orbits always remain at large angular momenta, or when the extra
accuracy is not needed. In all of the presented cases the accuracy in
precession in low energy orbits exceeds that of the well known potential of
Paczynski & Wiita (1980), which has ~30% error in the precession at all angular

Einstein-Hilbert gravity in each spacetime dimension $d \ge 3$. One type
contains solutions asymptotic to the expanding spatially-flat ($k=0$)
cosmological patch of de Sitter space while the other is asymptotic to the
expanding hyperbolic $(k=-1)$ patch. Each phase space has a non-trivial
asymptotic symmetry group (ASG) which includes the isometry group of the
corresponding de Sitter patch. For $d=3$ and $k=-1$ our ASG also contains
additional generators and leads to a Virasoro algebra with vanishing central
charge. Furthermore, we identify an interesting algebra (even larger than the
ASG) containing two Virasoro algebras related by a reality condition and having
imaginary central charges $\pm i \frac{3\ell}{2G}$. Our charges agree with
those obtained previously using dS/CFT methods for the same asymptotic Killing
fields showing that (at least some of) the dS/CFT charges act on a well-defined
phase space. Along the way we show that, despite the lack of local degrees of
freedom, the $d=3, k=-1$ phase space is non-trivial even in pure $\Lambda > 0$
Einstein-Hilbert gravity due to the existence of a family of `wormhole'
solutions labeled by their angular momentum, a mass-like parameter $\theta_0$,
the topology of future infinity ($I^+$), and perhaps additional internal
moduli. These solutions are $\Lambda > 0$ analogues of BTZ black holes and
exhibit a corresponding mass gap relative to empty de Sitter.

relaying protocol employing adaptive link selection, i.e., in any given time
slot, based on the channel state information of the source-relay and the
relay-destination link a decision is made whether the source or the relay
transmits. In order to avoid data loss at the relay, adaptive link selection
requires the relay to be equipped with a buffer such that data can be queued
until the relay-destination link is selected for transmission. We study both
delay constrained and delay unconstrained transmission. For the delay
unconstrained case, we characterize the optimal link selection policy, derive
the corresponding throughput, and develop an optimal power allocation scheme.
For the delay constrained case, we propose to starve the buffer of the relay by
choosing the decision threshold of the link selection policy smaller than the
optimal one and derive a corresponding upper bound on the average delay.
Furthermore, we propose a modified link selection protocol which avoids buffer
overflow by limiting the queue size. Our analytical and numerical results show
that buffer-aided relaying with adaptive link selection achieves significant
throughput gains compared to conventional relaying protocols with and without
buffers where the relay employs a fixed schedule for reception and
transmission.

different from the case of an s-wave interaction, where the pseudogap simply

recognized advantages in efficiency and accuracy. However, standard isosurface
rendering has some limitations in effectiveness. First, it uses a monotone
colored approach and can only visualize the geometry features of an isosurface.
The lack of the capability to illustrate the material property and the internal
structures behind an isosurface has been a big limitation of this method in
applications. Another limitation of isosurface rendering is the difficulty to
reveal physically meaningful structures, which are hidden in one or multiple
isosurfaces. As such, the application requirements of extract and recombine
structures of interest can not be implemented effectively with isosurface
rendering. In this work, we develop an enhanced isosurface rendering technique
to improve the effectiveness while maintaining the performance efficiency of
the standard isosurface rendering. First, an isosurface color enhancement
method is proposed to illustrate the neighborhood density and to reveal some of
the internal structures. Second, we extend the structure extraction capability
of isosurface rendering by enabling explicit scene exploration within a
3D-view, using surface peeling, voxel-selecting, isosurface segmentation, and
multi-surface-structure visualization. Our experiments show that the color
enhancement not only improves the visual fidelity of the rendering, but also
reveals the internal structures without significant increase of the
computational cost. Explicit scene exploration is also demonstrated as a
powerful tool in some application scenarios, such as displaying multiple

expression is an inherently noisy process due to thermal fluctuations and the

of TFs, the latter criterion hints at up-stream cross-regulation. We
demonstrate these ideas for competing TFs and feed-forward gene regulatory
modules, and discuss generalizations to other signaling pathways. Our results

antiferromagnetic (AF) and superconducting (SC) phases for a prototype of

found that paramagnetic-metal (PM) domains segregate from AF domains. PM
domains grow in size with increasing electron doping level and are accompanied
by the onset of superconductivity, and thus application of pressure or
increasing the doping level causes superconductivity. The existence of PM
domains cannot be explained by the existing paradigm that focuses only on the
relationship between superconductivity and antiferromagnetism. Based on orbital
fluctuation theory, the existence of PM domains is evidence of the
ferroquadrupole state.

shocked regions of colliding cold accretion flows near the centers of first
galaxies. Recent numerical simulations indicate that assembly of a typical
first galaxy with virial temperature (~10^4K) proceeds via cold and dense flows
penetrating deep to the center, where the supersonic streams collide each other
to develop a hot and dense (~10^4K, ~10^3/cc) shocked gas. The post-shock layer
first cools by efficient Ly alpha emission and contracts isobarically until
8000K. Whether the layer continues the isobaric contraction depends on the
density at this moment: if the density is high enough for collisionally
exciting H2 rovibrational levels (>10^4/cc), enhanced H2 collisional
dissociation suppresses the gas to cool further. In this case, the layer
fragments into massive (>10^5Msun) clouds, which collapse isothermally (~8000K)
by the Ly alpha cooling without subsequent fragmentation. As an outcome, SMSs
are expected to form and evolve eventually to seeds of supermassive black holes
(SMBH). By calculating thermal evolution of the post-shock gas, we delimit the
range of post-shock conditions for the SMS formation, which can be expressed
as: T>6000K/(n/10^4/cc) for n<10^4/cc and T>5000-6000K for n>10^4/cc, depending
somewhat on initial ionization degree. We found that metal enrichment does not
affect the above condition for metallicity below 10^-3Zsun if metals are in the
gas phase, while condensation of several percent of metals into dust decreases
this critical value of metallicity by an order of magnitude. Unlike the
previously proposed scenario for SMS formation, which postulates extremely
strong ultraviolet radiation to quench H2 cooling, our scenario naturally
explains the SMBH seed formation in the assembly process of the first galaxies,
even without such a strong radiation.

dynamics: mass density ratio between wing and fluid, spring elastic constant
and distance between the wing center of mass and the spring anchor point on the
wing. We found relationships between these parameters which rule the transition
between stable equilibrium and fluttering. The shape of the resulting marginal
curve has been successfully verified by high Reynolds number direct numerical
simulations. Our findings are of interest in applications related to energy
harvesting by fluid-structure interaction, a problem which has recently
attracted a great deal of attention. The main aim in that context is to
identify the optimal physical/geometrical system configuration leading to large
sustained motion, which is the source of energy we aim to extract.

effective radius R_e depends on stellar mass M as R_e(M) \propto M}^{alpha}
with alpha ~ 0.5 at all redshifts. The redshift evolution of the mass- or
SDSS-normalized size can be reproduced as \propto (1+z)^beta with beta ~ -1,
with the most massive ETGs possibly showing the fastest evolutionary rate (beta
~ -1.4). This size evolution slows down significantly to beta ~ -0.6 if the
ETGs at z>2 are removed from the sample, suggesting an accelerated increase of
the typical sizes at z>2, especially for the ETGs with the largest masses. A
pure dry merging LambdaCDM model is marginally consistent with the average size

that due to the high survey frequency of 20 GHz, the source population is
strongly dominated by compact sources (79%). At 0.15 arcseconds angular
resolution limit, we show a very strong correlation between the compact and
extended sources with flat and steep-spectrum sources respectively. Thus, we
provide a firm physical basis for the traditional spectral classification into
flat and steep-spectrum sources to separate compact and extended sources. We
find the cut-off of -0.46 to be optimum for spectral indices between 1 and 5
GHz and, hence, recommend the continued use of -0.5 for future studies.
  We study the effect of spectral curvature on redshift cut-off of compact AGNs
using recently published redshift data. Using spectral indices at different
frequencies, we correct for the redshift effect and produce restframe frequency
spectra for compact sources for redshift up to ~5. We show that the flat
spectra of most compact sources start to steepen at ~30 GHz. At higher
frequencies, the spectra of both populations are steep so the use of spectral
index does not separate the compact and extended source populations as well as
in lower frequencies. We find that due to the spectral steepening, surveys of
compact sources at higher frequencies (>5 GHz) will have redshift cut-off due
to spectral curvature but at lower frequencies, the surveys are not
significantly affected by spectral curvature, thus, the evidence for a strong
redshift cut-off in AGNs found in lower frequency surveys is a real cut-off and
not a result of K-correction.

periodic nonlinear dynamical systems. Self-organization of waves and vortices
on small scales in both cases leads to large-scale flows, which are, depending

function of mRNA numbers. When the dynamics of mRNA is assumed to be a fast
process (due to faster mRNA degradation than that of protein) we prove that,
with appropriate scalings in the burst rate, jump size or translational rate,
the bursting phenomena can be transmitted to the slow variable. We show that,
depending on the scaling, the reduced equation is either a stochastic
differential equation with a jump Poisson process or a deterministic ordinary
differential equation. These results are significant because adiabatic
reduction techniques seem to have not been rigorously justified for a
stochastic differential system containing a jump Markov process. We expect that
the results can be generalized to adiabatic methods in more general stochastic
hybrid systems.

instability (SGI) to operate at the midplane dust layer of protoplanetary
disks. For SGI to be a viable process, the growth time of the instability
T_grow must be shorter than the radial drift time of the dust T_drift. The
growth time depends on the turbulent diffusion parameter alpha, because the
modes with short wavelengths are stabilized by turbulent diffusion. Assuming
that turbulence is excited via the Kelvin-Helmholtz or streaming instabilities
in the dust layer, and that its strength is controlled by the energy supply
rate from dust accretion, we estimate the diffusion parameter and the growth
time of the instability. The condition T_grow < T_drift requires that the dust
abundance must be greater than a critical abundance Z_min, which is a function
of the Toomre parameter Q_g and aspect ratio h_g / r of the gas disk. For a
wide range of parameter space, the required dust abundance is less than 0.1. A
slight increase in dust abundance opens a possible route for the dust to
directly collapse to planetesimals.

vector magnetograms but these data have been shown to be problematic as the
sole boundary information for nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)
extrapolations. Magnetic fields in the corona manifest themselves in
high-energy images (X-rays and EUV) in the shapes of coronal loops, providing
an additional constraint that at present is not used due to the mathematical
complications of incorporating such input into numerical models. Projection
effects and the limited number of usable loops further complicate the use of
coronal information. We develop and test an algorithm to use images showing
coronal loops in the modeling of the solar coronal magnetic field. We first fit
projected field lines with field lines of constant-\als force-free fields to
approximate the three-dimensional distribution of currents in the corona along
a sparse set of trajectories. We then apply a Grad-Rubin-like iterative
technique to obtain a volume-filling nonlinear force-free model of the magnetic
field, modifying method presented in \citet{Wheatland2007}. We thoroughly test
the technique on known analytical and solar-like model magnetic fields
previously used for comparing different extrapolation techniques
\citep{Schrijver2006, Schrijver2008} and compare the results with those

helicity in the corona to the flux of magnetic helicity through the photosphere
and find that the two rates are similar. This gives observational evidence that
helicity flux across the photosphere is indeed what drives helicity changes in
solar corona during emergence.
  For the purposes of estimating coronal helicity we neither assume a strictly
linear force-free field, nor attempt to construct a non-linear force-free
field. For each coronal loop evident in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) we find a
best-matching line of a linear force-free field and allow the twist parameter
alpha to be different for each line. This method was introduced and its
applicability was discussed in Malanushenko et. al. (2009).
  The object of the study is emerging and rapidly rotating AR 9004 over about
80 hours. As a proxy for coronal helicity we use the quantity <alpha_i*L_i/2>
averaged over many reconstructed lines of magnetic field. We argue that it is
approximately proportional to ""flux-normalized"" helicity H/Phi^2, where H is
helicity and Phi is total enclosed magnetic flux of the active region. The time
rate of change of such quantity in the corona is found to be about 0.021
rad/hr, which is compatible with the estimates for the same region obtained
using other methods Longcope et. al. (2007), who estimated the flux of

diagram. In particular, we find a canted antiferromagnetic state near the
interface when antiferromagnetic-ordering exists inside the Mott insulator. A
checkerboard charge-ordering proposed previously is also stabilized for large
long-range Coulomb interactions. Regarding its origin we also point out the
importance of interlayer spin-mediated interactions. It is further shown that
such a strong spin-charge coupling gives rise to pronounced magnetic/charge
order phase transitions in external magnetic fields: a firstorder metamagnetic
transition and a reentrant charge-order transition with checkerboard pattern.
The mechanisms stabilizing these intriguing phases are explored through a

on the plasma background which produce a radial electric field and force the
trapped electron component into an azimuthal drift. In this way electron holes
generate magnetic fields in the hole. We solve the cylindrical hole model
exactly for the hole charge, electric potential and magnetic field. In electron
holes, the magnetic field is amplified on the flux tube of the hole;
equivalently, in ion holes the field would be decreased. The flux tube adjacent
to the electron hole is magnetically depleted by the external hole dipole
field. This causes magnetic filamentation. It is also shown that holes are
massive objects, each carrying a finite magnetic moment. Binary magnetic dipole
interaction of these moments will cause alignment of the holes into chains
along the magnetic field or, in the three-dimensional case, produce a magnetic
fabric in the volume of hole formation. Since holes, in addition to being
carriers of charges and magnetic moments, also have finite masses, they behave
like quasi-particles, performing ExB, magnetic field, and diamagnetic drifts.
In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, their magnetic moments experience torque
which causes nutation of the hole around the direction of the magnetic field
presumably giving rise to low frequency magnetic modulations like pulsations. A
gas of many such holes may allow for a kinetic description in which holes
undergo binary dipole interactions. This resembles the polymeric behaviour.
Both magnetic field generation and magnetic structure formation is of interest

the other hand, we implement a recursive Nadaraya-Watson procedure for the
estimation of the regression function which takes into account the previous

successfully doped the Ru with Fe and Co atoms. Contrasting behaviors of
suppression to superconductivity is discovered between the Fe and the Co
dopants: Fe-impurities can suppress the superconductivity completely at a
doping level of only 3%, while the superconductivity is suppressed slowly with
the Co dopants. A systematic magnetization measurements indicate that the doped
Fe impurities lead to spin-polarized electrons yielding magnetic moments with
the magnitude of 1.6 $\mu_B$\ per Fe, while the electrons given by the Co
dopants have the same density of states for spin-up and spin-down leading to
much weaker magnetic moments. It is the strong local magnetic moments given by
the Fe-dopants that suppress the superconductivity. The band structure
calculation further supports this conclusion.

unveiled observationally using different techniques. The magnetic field is
quasi-isotropic and has field strengths weaker than 100G. It is pervasive and
may host a local dynamo. Aims: We aim to determine the length scale of the
turbulent magnetic field in the quiet Sun. Methods: The Stokes V area asymmetry
is sensitive to minute variations in the magnetic topology along the line of
sight. Using data provided by Hinode-SOT/SP instrument, we performed a
statistical study of this quantity.We classified the different magnetic regimes
and infer properties of the turbulent magnetic regime. In particular we
measured the correlation length associated to these fields for the first time.
Results: The histograms of Stokes V area asymmetries reveal three different
regimes: one organized, quasi-vertical and strong field (flux tubes or other
structures of the like); a strongly asymmetric group of profiles found around
field concentrations; and a turbulent isotropic field. For the last, we confirm
its isotropy and measure correlation lengths from hundreds of kilometers down
to 10km, at which point we lost sensitivity. A crude attempt to measure the
power spectra of these turbulent fields is made. Conclusions: In addition to
confirming the existence of a turbulent field in the quiet Sun, we give further
prove of its isotropy.We also measure correlation lengths down to 10km. The
combined results show magnetic fields with a large span of length scales, as
expected from a turbulent cascade.

attracted much attention. The theoretical results imply that this problem is
highly intractable, e.g., synthesizing a system is 2EXPTIME-complete for an LTL

argument against it is that the temporal specification is highly compact, and
the complexity reflects the large size of the system constructed. In that

the minimal satisfying system. A careful observation reveals that the size of
the system is presented in such arguments as the size of its state space. This
view is a bit nonstandard, in the sense that the state space can be
exponentially larger than the size of a reasonable implementation such as a
circuit or a program. Although this alternative measure of the size of the
synthesized system is more intuitive (e.g., this is the standard way model
checking problems are measured), research on synthesis has so far stayed with
measuring the system in terms of the explicit state space. This raises the
question of whether or not there always exists a small system. In this paper,
we show that this is the case if, and only if, PSPACE = EXPTIME.

and 149\pm63 m/s^2 for accelerating and decelerating features, respectively.
Typical flocculent features measure 627\pm44 km in length and 304\pm30 km in
width. On average 68 features are detected per minute, with an average lifetime
of 67.7\pm8.8 s. The dynamics and phenomenology of the flocculent flows suggest
they may be driven by a siphon flow, where the flocculence could arise from a
density perturbation close to one of the footpoints or along the loop
structure.

(WIMPs) and revisit in detail its thermal evolution in the early universe, with
a particular focus on models where the annihilation rate is enhanced by the
Sommerfeld effect. After chemical decoupling, or freeze-out, dark matter no
longer annihilates but is still kept in local thermal equilibrium due to
scattering events with the much more abundant standard model particles. During
kinetic decoupling, even these processes stop to be effective, which eventually
sets the scale for a small-scale cutoff in the matter density fluctuations.
Afterwards, the WIMP temperature decreases more quickly than the heat bath
temperature, which causes dark matter to reenter an era of annihilation if the
cross-section is enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect. Here, we give a detailed
and self-consistent description of these effects. As an application, we
consider the phenomenology of simple leptophilic models that have been
discussed in the literature and find that the relic abundance can be affected
by as much two orders of magnitude or more. We also compute the mass of the
smallest dark matter subhalos in these models and find it to be in the range of
about 10^{-10} to 10 solar masses; even much larger cutoff values are possible
if the WIMPs couple to force carriers lighter than about 100 MeV. We point out
that a precise determination of the cutoff mass allows to infer new limits on
the model parameters, in particular from gamma-ray observations of galaxy
clusters, that are highly complementary to existing constraints from g-2 or
beam dump experiments.

momentum (OAM) is well understood and such beams, sometimes known as vortex
beams, have found applications in optics and microscopy. Recently electron
beams carrying very large values of axial OAM have been generated. In the
absence of coupling to an external electromagnetic field the propagation of
such vortex electron beams is virtually identical mathematically to that of
vortex photon beams propagating in a medium with a homogeneous index of
refraction. But when coupled to an external electromagnetic field the
propagation of vortex electron beams is distinctly different from photons. Here
we use the exact path integral solution to Schrodingers equation to examine the
time evolution of an electron wave function carrying axial OAM. Interestingly
we find that the nonzero OAM wave function can be obtained from the zero OAM
wave function, in the case considered here, simply by multipling it by an
appropriate time and position dependent prefactor. Hence adding OAM and
propagating can in this case be replaced by first propagating then adding OAM.
Also, the results shown provide an explicit illustration of the fact that the
gyromagnetic ratio for OAM is unity. We also propose a novel version of the
Bohm-Aharonov effect using vortex electron beams.

DRVmax, the maximum radial-velocity difference between any two epochs for the
same object. At low values, the core of this distribution is dominated by
measurement errors, but for large enough samples there is a high-velocity tail
that can effectively constrain the parameters of the binary population. We
discuss our approach for the case of a population of detached white-dwarf (WD)
binaries with separations that are decaying via gravitational wave emission. We
derive analytic expressions for the present-day distribution of separations,
integrated over the star-formation history of the Galaxy, for parametrized
initial WD separation distributions at the end of the common-envelope phase. We
use Monte Carlo techniques to produce grids of simulated DRVmax distributions
with specific binary population parameters, and the same sampling cadences and
radial velocity errors as the observations, and we compare them to the real
DRVmax distribution to constrain the properties of the binary population. We
illustrate the sensitivity of the method to both the model and the
observational parameters. In the particular case of binary white dwarfs, every

to type-Ia supernova rates. In a companion paper, we apply the method to a

0.05 AU, fbin, and the power-law index in the separation distribution at the
end of the common envelope phase, alpha. Although there is some degeneracy
between fbin and alpha, the the fifteen high DRVmax systems that we find
constrain the combination of these parameters, which determines a white dwarf
merger rate per unit stellar mass of 1.4(+3.4,-1.0)e-13 /yr/Msun (1-sigma
limits). This is remarkably similar to the measured rate of Type Ia supernovae
per unit stellar mass in Milky-Way-like Sbc galaxies. The rate of
super-Chandrasekhar mergers is only 1.0(+1.6,-0.6)e-14 /yr/Msun. We conclude
that there are not enough close binary white dwarf systems to reproduce the
observed Type Ia SN rate in the 'classic' double degenerate super-Chandrasekhar
scenario. On the other hand, if sub-Chandrasekhar mergers can lead to Type Ia
SNe, as recently suggested by some studies, they could make a major
contribution to the overall Type Ia SN rate. Although unlikely, we cannot rule
out contamination of our sample by M-dwarf binaries or non-Gaussian errors.

feed resource classification. Little is known about the effect of settings on
folksonomies created on social tagging systems. In this work, we consider the
settings of social tagging systems to further understand tag distributions in
folksonomies. We analyze in depth the tag distributions on three large-scale
social tagging datasets, and analyze the effect on a resource classification
task. To this end, we study the appropriateness of applying weighting schemes
based on the well-known TF-IDF for resource classification. We show the great
importance of settings as to altering tag distributions. Among those settings,
tag suggestions produce very different folksonomies, which condition the
success of the employed weighting schemes. Our findings and analyses are
relevant for researchers studying tag-based resource classification, user
behavior in social networks, the structure of folksonomies and tag
distributions, as well as for developers of social tagging systems in search of
an appropriate setting.

necessary and sufficient conditions for the primeness and the primitivity of

arbitrary precision by a control satisfying the integer restrictions. The
results are obtained by semigroup theory methods. The approach is constructive
and gives rise to a numerical method. We supplement the analysis with numerical
experiments.

latencies will improve the overall execution time of a workflow and thus lead
to a more efficient and robust processing environment. In this paper, we
propose a pilot job based infrastructure that has intelligent data reuse and
job execution strategies to minimize the scheduling, queuing, execution and

progressive transition, as a function of $n$, from a strong to a weak

Structurally, they display continuous rotation of polarization connecting

and agility benefits. However, security and regulatory compliance issues are
continuing to challenge the wide acceptance of such technology both from social
and commercial stakeholders. An important facture behind this is the fact that
clouds and in particular public clouds are usually deployed and used within
broad geographical or even international domains. This implies that the
exchange of private and other protected data within the cloud environment would
be governed by multiple jurisdictions. These jurisdictions have a great degree
of harmonisation; however, they present possible conflicts that are hard to
negotiate at run time. So far, important efforts were played in order to deal
with regulatory compliance management for large distributed systems. However,
measurable solutions are required for the context of cloud. In this position
paper, we are suggesting an approach that starts with a conceptual model of
explicit regulatory requirements for exchanging private data on a
multijurisdictional environment and build on it in order to define metrics for
non-compliance or, in other terms, risks to compliance. These metrics will be
integrated within usual data access-control policies and will be checked at
policy analysis time before a decision to allow/deny the data access is made.

doping N impurities together with making Si vacancies. Aiming at obtaining a
large ZT, we study possible energetically stable configurations, and disclose
that, when N dopants locate at the center, a small number of Si vacancies at
corners are most favored for n-type nanowires, while a large number of Si
vacancies spreading into the flat edge sites are most favored for p-type
nanowires. For the SiCNW with a diameter of 1.1 nm and a length of 4.6 nm, the

conditions to get higher ZT values for longer SiCNWs are also addressed.

equivalence classes based on the modulo 6 return value as applied to the
Natural numbers. Five features of this 'Hexile' sieve are reviewed. The first
aspect, is that it narrows the search for primes to one-third of the Natural
numbers. The second feature is that we can obtain from the equivalence class
formulae, a property of its diophantine equations to distinguish between primes
and composites resulting from multiplication of these primes. Thirdly we can
from these diophantine formulations ascribe a non-random occurence to not only
the composites in the two equivalence classes but by default and as a
consequence : non-randomness of occurence to the resident primes. Fourthly we
develop a theoretical basis for sieving primes. Of final mention is that the
diophantine equations allows another route to a prime counting function using
combinatorics or numerical analysis.
