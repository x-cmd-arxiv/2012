exponentiation satisfying the Schanuel Property, which is the abstract
statement of Schanuel's Conjecture, and an adapted form of existential closure.
  Here we show that if we remove the Schanuel Property and just care about
existential closure, it is possible to create several existentially closed
exponential functions on the algebraic numbers that still have similarities
with complex exponentiation. The main difficulties are related to the
arithmetic of algebraic numbers, and they can be overcome with known results
about specialisations of multiplicatively independent functions on algebraic
varieties.

the problem demands gauge fixing, leaving no room to ambiguity in the

analogous to that of superconductivity gauge theory. We develop a variational

  pack--Radiative transfer simulations versus satellite radiances","Made some minor corrections",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  Microwave emissivity models of sea ice are poorly validated empirically.
Typical validation studies involve using averaged or stereotyped profiles of
ice parameters against averaged radiance measurements. Measurement sites are
rarely matched and even less often point-by-point. Because of saline content,
complex permittivity of sea ice is highly variable and difficult to predict.
Therefore, to check the validity of a typical, plane-parallel,
radiative-transfer-based ice emissivity model, we apply it to fresh water ice
instead of salt-water ice. Radiance simulations for lake ice are compared with
measurements over Lake Superior from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer
on EOS (AMSR-E). AMSR-E measurements are also collected over Antarctic icepack.
For each pixel, a thermodynamic model is driven by four years of European
Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis data and the
resulting temperature profiles used to drive the emissivity model. The results
suggest that the relatively simple emissivity model is a good fit to the data.
Both cases, however, show large discrepencies whose most likely explanation is
scattering both within the ice sheet as well as by cloudy atmospheres.
Scattering is neglected by the model. Further work is needed to refine the
scattering component of ice emissivity models and to generate accurate
estimates of complex permittivities within sea ice.

cost of both communication and sensing. In the first formulation of the
problem, the sensor has a separate energy budget for sensing and a rate budget
for communication, while, in the second, it has a single energy budget for both
tasks. Assuming that sources with larger variances have lower sensing costs,
the optimal allocation of sensing energy and rate that minimizes the overall

sources with larger variances are transmitted on channels with lower noise.
Closed-form solutions are also obtained for the case where the energy budget is
sufficiently large. For an arbitrary order on the variances and costs, the
optimal solution to the first problem is also obtained numerically and compared

justified by their broad adoption by enterprises as well as their capability to
warranty interoperability between both intra and inter-enterprises systems.
Thereby, we propose in this chapter a metamodel for describing business
processes, and discuss their dynamic integration by addressing the Web services
discovery issue. On the one hand, the proposed metamodel is in line with the
W3C Web services standards, namely, WSDL, SAWSDL and WS-Policy. It considers
the use of BPMN standard to describe the behavioral aspect of business
processes and completes their design using UML diagrams describing their
functional, non-functional and semantic aspects. On other hand, our approach
for integrating processes is in line with BPEL standard recommended to
orchestrate Web services. To realize executable business processes, this
approach recommends the use of semantic matching and selection mechanisms in

  Outlines from Digital Photographs in DARWIN (Digital Analysis and Recognition

A&M---exist to facilitate the identification of cetaceans---whales, dolphins,
porpoises---based upon the naturally occurring features along the edges of
their dorsal fins. Such identification is useful for biological studies of
population, social interaction, migration, etc. The process whereby fin
outlines are extracted in current fin-recognition software packages is manually
intensive and represents a major user input bottleneck: it is both time
consuming and visually fatiguing. This research aims to develop automated
methods (employing unsupervised thresholding and morphological processing
techniques) to extract cetacean dorsal fin outlines from digital photographs
thereby reducing manual user input. Ideally, automatic outline generation will
improve the overall user experience and improve the ability of the software to
correctly identify cetaceans. Various transformations from color to gray space
were examined to determine which produced a grayscale image in which a suitable
threshold could be easily identified. To assist with unsupervised thresholding,
a new metric was developed to evaluate the jaggedness of figures (""pixelarity"")
in an image after thresholding. The metric indicates how cleanly a threshold
segments background and foreground elements and hence provides a good measure
of the quality of a given threshold. This research results in successful
extractions in roughly 93% of images, and significantly reduces user-input
time.

An initially localized pair ($d=0$) is found to be more stable as quantified by
the pair probability (probability to find two atoms at the same lattice site)
when the interaction and/or the center of mass quasi-momentum is increased. For
initially separated atoms ($d \neq 0$) there exists an optimal interaction
strength for pair formation. Simple expressions for the wavefunction, the pair
probability and the optimal interaction strength for pair formation are
computed in the limit of infinite time. Whereas the time-dependent wavefunction
differs for values of the interaction strength that differ only by the sign,
important observables like the density and the pair probability do not. With a
symmetry analysis this behavior is shown to extend to the $N$-particle level
and to fermionic systems. Our results provide a complementary understanding of

transition from normal to superradiant phases at finite-temperature, we point
it out that a new phase, the coexistence of normal and superradient phases, was
also observed in the experiment. We show rich finite temperature phase diagrams
existing in the experimental system by tuning various experimental parameters.
We find that the specific heat of the BEC can serve as a powerful tool for
probing various phases.

such as the Laplacian on the unbounded (i.e., infinite) Sierpinski gasket and a
self-similar Sturm-Liouville operator associated with a fractal self-similar
measure on the half-line. In the latter case, C. Sabot discovered the relation
between the spectrum of this operator and the iteration of a rational map of
several complex variables, called the renormalization map. We obtain a
factorization of the spectral zeta function of such an operator, expressed in
terms of the Dirac delta hyperfunction, a geometric zeta function, and the zeta
function associated with the dynamics of the corresponding renormalization map,
viewed either as a polynomial function on the complex plane (in the first case)
or (in the second case) as a polynomial on the complex projective plane. Our
first main result extends to the case of the fractal Laplacian on the unbounded
Sierpinski gasket a factorization formula obtained by the second author for the
spectral zeta function of a fractal string and later extended by A. Teplyaev to
the bounded (i.e., finite) Sierpinski gasket and some other decimable fractals.
Furthermore, our second main result generalizes these factorization formulas to
the renormalization maps of several complex variables associated with fractal
Sturm-Liouville operators. Moreover, as a corollary, in the very special case
when the underlying self-similar measure is Lebesgue measure on [0, 1], we
obtain a representation of the Riemann zeta function in terms of the dynamics
of a certain polynomial in the complex projective plane, thereby extending to
several variables an analogous result by A. Teplyaev.

strategy. Given the practical importance of the method, the aim of this paper
is to provide a theoretical performance examination of lookahead search in a
wide variety of applications.
  To determine a strategy play using lookahead search}, each agent predicts
multiple levels of possible re-actions to her move (via the use of a search
tree), and then chooses the play that optimizes her future payoff accounting
for these re-actions. There are several choices of optimization function the
agents can choose, where the most appropriate choice of function will depend on
the specifics of the actual game - we illustrate this in our examples.
Furthermore, the type of search tree chosen by computationally-constrained
agent can vary. We focus on the case where agents can evaluate only a bounded
number, $k$, of moves into the future. That is, we use depth $k$ search trees
and call this approach {\em k-lookahead search}.
  We apply our method in five well-known settings: AdWord auctions; industrial
organization (Cournot's model); congestion games; valid-utility games and
basic-utility games; cost-sharing network design games. We consider two
questions. First, what is the expected social quality of outcome when agents
apply lookahead search? Second, what interactive behaviours can be exhibited
when players use lookahead search?

modalities of fluctuations, and derived values of the mass accretion rates are
indicative of strong similarities between the two samples. We demonstrate how
the difference between the outburst and the quiescence spectral energy
distribution of all the EXor can be well fitted with a single blackbody, as if
an additional thermal component appears during the outbursting phase.
Temperatures of this additional component span between 1000 and 4500 K, while
the radii of the emitting regions (assumed to be a uniform disk) span between
0.01 and 0.1 AU, sizes typical of the inner portions of the circumstellar disk.
Spots persisting up to 50% of the outburst duration, not exceeding the 10% of
the stellar surface, and with temperatures compatible with the EXor mass
accretion rates, are able to account for both the appearance of the additional
thermal component and the dust sublimation in the inner structures of the disk.
We also compare the EXor events with the most significant color and magnitude
fluctuations of active T Tauri stars finding that (i} burst accretion phenomena
should also be important for this latter class; (ii} EXor events could be more
frequent then those accidentally discovered. Remarkable is the case of the

detailed balance along with measurements at several temperatures allows us to
subtract both temperature-independent and phonon backgrounds from S(Q,\omega)

(x=0.009(3)), the sample is superconducting (T_{c}=14 K) and displays a spin
gap of 7 meV peaked in momentum at wave vector q_{0}=(\pi,\pi) consistent with
single crystal results. On populating the interstitial iron sites, the
superconducting volume fraction decreases and we observe a filling in of the
low-energy magnetic fluctuations and a decrease of the characteristic wave
vector of the magnetic fluctuations. For large concentrations of interstitial
iron (x=0.048(2)) where the superconducting volume fraction is minimal, we
observe the presence of gapless spin fluctuations at a wave vector of
q_{0}=(\pi,0). We estimate the absolute total moment for the various samples

magnetic spectral weight significantly, but rather has the effect of shifting
the spectral weight in Q and energy. These results show that the
superconducting and magnetic properties can be tuned by doping small amounts of
