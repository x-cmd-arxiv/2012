observations of HD113766. These sources represent the youngest (16Myr and 12Myr
old respectively) debris disc hosts with emission on <<10AU scales. We find
that the disc of HD113766 is partially resolved on baselines of 42-102m, with
variations in resolution with baseline length consistent with a Gaussian model
for the disc with FWHM of 1.2-1.6AU (9-12mas). This is consistent with the
VISIR observations which place an upper limit of 0.""14 (17AU) on the emission,
with no evidence for extended emission at larger distances. For HD172555 the
MIDI observations are consistent with complete resolution of the disc emission
on all baselines of lengths 56-93m, putting the dust at a distance of >1AU
(>35mas). When combined with limits from TReCS imaging the dust at ~10um is
constrained to lie somewhere in the region 1-8AU. Observations at ~18um reveal
extended disc emission which could originate from the outer edge of a broad
disc, the inner parts of which are also detected but not resolved at 10um, or
from a spatially distinct component. These observations provide the most
accurate direct measurements of the location of dust at 1-8AU that might
originate from the collisions expected during terrestrial planet formation.
These observations provide valuable constraints for models of the composition
of discs at this epoch and provide a foundation for future studies to examine
in more detail the morphology of debris discs.

theories. Compactified theories offer an interesting context in which to think
about locality, since interactions can be nonlocal in the compact directions
while still being local in the extended ones. In this paper, we study locality
in ""theory space"", four-dimensional Lagrangians which are dimensional
deconstructions of five-dimensional Yang-Mills. In explicit ultraviolet (UV)
completions, one can understand the origin of theory space locality by the
irrelevance of nonlocal operators. From an infrared (IR) point of view, though,
theory space locality does not appear to be a special property, since the
lowest-lying Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes are simply described by a gauged nonlinear
sigma model, and locality imposes seemingly arbitrary constraints on the KK
spectrum and interactions. We argue that these constraints are nevertheless
important from an IR perspective, since they affect the four-dimensional cutoff
of the theory where high energy scattering hits strong coupling. Intriguingly,
we find that maximizing this cutoff scale implies five-dimensional locality. In
this way, theory space locality is correlated with weak coupling in the IR,
independent of UV considerations. We briefly comment on other scenarios where
maximizing the cutoff scale yields interesting physics, including theory space
descriptions of QCD and deconstructions of anti-de Sitter space.

relating spectral data to physical processes occurring in massive star winds.
In a preceding paper, our group reported on hydrodynamic simulations of
hypersonic flow past a rigid spherical clump to explore the structure of bow
shocks that can form around wind clumps. Here we report on profiles of emission
lines that arise from such bow shock morphologies. To compute emission line
profiles, we adopt a two component flow structure of wind and clumps using two
""beta"" velocity laws. While individual bow shocks tend to generate double
horned emission line profiles, a group of bow shocks can lead to line profiles
with a range of shapes with blueshifted peak emission that depends on the
degree of X-ray photoabsorption by the interclump wind medium, the number of
clump structures in the flow, and the radial distribution of the clumps. Using
the two beta law prescription, the theoretical emission measure and temperature
distribution throughout the wind can be derived. The emission measure tends to
be power law, and the temperature distribution broad in terms of wind velocity.
Although restricted to the case of adiabatic cooling, our models highlight the
influence of bow shock effects for hot plasma temperature and emission measure
distributions in stellar winds and their impact on X-ray line profile shapes.
Previous models have focused on geometrical considerations of the clumps and
their distribution in the wind. Our results represent the first time that the
temperature distribution of wind clump structures are explicitly and
self-consistently accounted in modeling X-ray line profile shapes for massive
stars.

limits on the DM velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section <sigma v> as a
function of the DM particle mass are derived. Constraints are derived for
different DM particle models, such as those arising from Kaluza-Klein and
supersymmetric models. Various annihilation final states are considered.
Possible enhancements of the DM annihilation gamma-ray flux, due to DM
substructures of the DM host halo, or from the Sommerfeld effect, are studied.
Additional gamma-ray contributions from internal bremsstrahlung and inverse
Compton radiation are also discussed. For a DM particle mass of 1 TeV, the
exclusion limits at 95% of confidence level reach values of <sigma v> ~
10^-23cm^3s^-1, depending on the DM particle model and halo properties.
Additional contribution from DM substructures can improve the upper limits on
<\sigma v> by more than two orders of magnitude. At masses around 4.5 TeV, the
enhancement by substructures and the Sommerfeld resonance effect results in a
velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section upper limit at the level of

black hole in our Galaxy, reported by Gillessen et al., is formed by a
photoevaporation wind originating in a disk around a star that is tidally
perturbed and shocked at every peribothron passage. The disk is proposed to
have formed when a stellar black hole flew by the star, tidally disrupted its
envelope, and placed the star on its present orbit with some of the tidal
debris forming a disk. A disrupting encounter at the location of the observed
cloud is most likely to be caused by a stellar black hole because of the
expected dynamical mass segregation; the rate of these disk-forming encounters
may be as high as $\sim 10^{-6}$ per year. The star should also be spun up by
the encounter, so the disk may subsequently expand by absorbing angular
momentum from the star. Once the disk expands up to the tidal truncation
radius, the tidal perturbation of the outer disk edge at every peribothron may
place gas streams on larger orbits which can give rise to a photoevaporation
wind that forms the cloud at every orbit. This model predicts that, after the
cloud is disrupted at the next peribothron passage in 2013, a smaller
unresolved cloud will gradually grow around the star on the same present orbit.
An increased infrared luminosity from the disk may also be detectable when the
peribothron is reached. We also note that this model revives the encounter
theory for planet formation.

characterized by broad regions in parameter space in which (i) mean
first-passage times scale algebraically with system size, and (ii) the system

evolution of Arctic sea ice we isolate the conditions required for the
existence of stable seasonally-varying solutions, in which ice forms each
winter and melts away each summer. This is done by constructing a two-season
model from the continuously evolving theory of Eisenman and Wettlaufer (2009)
and showing that seasonally-varying states are unstable under constant annual
average short-wave radiative forcing. However, dividing the summer season into
two intervals (ice covered and ice free) provides sufficient freedom to
stabilize seasonal ice. Simple perturbation theory shows that the condition for
stability is determined by when the ice vanishes in summer and hence the
relative magnitudes of the summer heat flux over the ocean versus over the ice.
This scenario is examined within the context of greenhouse gas warming, as a
function of which stability conditions are discerned.

equations, which take into account the nonlinear pairbreaking of Meissner
screening currents, and calculated $H_s(T)$ for arbitrary temperatures and
impurity concentrations in a single-band s-wave superconductor with a large
Ginzburg-Landau parameter. At low temperatures nonmagnetic impurities suppress
a weak maximum in $H_s(T)$ which has been predicted for the clean limit,
resulting instead in a maximum of $H_s$ as a function of impurity concentration
in a moderately clean limit. It is shown that nonmagnetic impurities weakly
affect $H_s$ even in the dirty limit, while magnetic impurities suppress both
$H_s$ and the critical temperature $T_c$. The density of quasiparticles states
$N(\epsilon)$ is strongly affected by an interplay of impurity scattering and
current pairbreaking. We show that a clean superconductor at $H=H_s$ is in a
gapless state, but a quasiparticle gap $\epsilon_g$ in $N(\epsilon)$ at $H=H_s$
appears as the concentration of nonmagnetic impurities increases. As the
nonmagnetic scattering rate $\alpha$ increases above $\alpha_c=0.36$, the
quasiparticle gap $\epsilon_g(\alpha)$ at $H=H_s$ increases, approaching
$\epsilon_g\approx 0.32\Delta_0$ in the dirty limit $\alpha\gg 1$, where
$\Delta_0$ is the superconducting gap parameter at zero field. The effects of

theoretical and experimental realization of a macroscopic quantum superposition
(MQS) made up with photons. As it is well known, this intriguing, fundamental
quantum condition is at the core of a famous argument conceived by Erwin
Schroedinger, back in 1935. The main experimental challenge to the actual
realization of this object resides generally on the unavoidable and
uncontrolled interactions with the environment, i.e. the decoherence leading to
the cancellation of any evidence of the quantum features associated with the
macroscopic system. The present scheme is based on a nonlinear process, the
""quantum injected optical parametric amplification"", that maps by a linearized
cloning process the quantum coherence of a single - particle state, i.e. a
Micro - qubit, into a Macro - qubit, consisting in a large number M of photons
in quantum superposition. Since the adopted scheme was found resilient to
decoherence, the MQS\ demonstration was carried out experimentally at room
temperature with $M\geq $ $10^{4}$. This result elicited an extended study on
quantum cloning, quantum amplification and quantum decoherence. The related
theory is outlined in the article where several experiments are reviewed such
as the test on the ""no-signaling theorem"" and the dynamical interaction of the
photon MQS with a Bose-Einstein condensate. In addition, the consideration of
the Micro - Macro entanglement regime is extended into the Macro - Macro
condition. The MQS interference patterns for large M were revealed in the
experiment and the bipartite Micro-Macro entanglement was also demonstrated for
a limited number of generated particles: $M\precsim 12$. At last, the
perspectives opened by this new method are considered in the view of further
studies on quantum foundations and quantum measurement.

arbitrary degree. This allows to express the partition function of the O(n)
loop model as a specialization of the multivariate generating function of maps
with controlled face degrees, where the face weights are determined by a fixed
point condition. We deduce a functional equation for the resolvent of the
model, involving some ring generating function describing the immediate
vicinity of the loops. When the ring generating function has a single pole, the
model is amenable to a full solution. Physically, such situation is realized
upon considering loops visiting triangles only and further weighting these
loops by some local bending energy. Our model interpolates between the two
previously solved cases of triangulations without bending energy and
quadrangulations with rigid loops. We analyze the phase diagram of our model in
details and derive in particular the location of its non-generic critical
points, which are in the universality classes of the dense and dilute O(n)
model coupled to 2D quantum gravity. Similar techniques are also used to solve
a twisting loop model on quadrangulations where loops are forced to make turns
within each visited square. Along the way, we revisit the problem of maps with

amplitudes. We generalize the one-dimensional model to the three-dimensional
case corresponding to the sequence of layers connected via the amplitudes,
which depend on the in-plane momentum p = (p_x,p_y). The Hamiltonian of the
model is described a (2 x 2) Hamiltonian with the off-diagonal element t(k,p)
depending also on the out-of-plane momentum k. We show that the complex
function t(k,p) defines the properties of the surface states. The surface
states exist for the in-plane momenta p, where the winding number of the
function t(k,p) is non-zero as k is changed from 0 to 2pi. The sign of the
winding number defines the sublattice on which the surface states are
localized. The equation t(k,p)=0 defines a vortex line in the three-dimensional
momentum space. The projection of the vortex line on the two-dimensional
momentum p space encircles the domain where the surface states exist. We
illustrate how our approach works for a well-known TI model on a diamond
lattice. We find that different configurations of the vortex lines are
responsible for the ""weak"" and ""strong"" topological insulator phases. The phase
transition occurs when the vortex lines reconnect from spiral to circular form.
We discuss the Shockley model description of Bi_2Se_3 and the applicability of
the continuous approximation for the description of the topological edge
states. We conclude that the tight-binding model gives a better description of
the surface states.

kinetic constraint, we explore the different ways in which dynamical
facilitation manifests itself within the local dynamics of glassy materials.
Dynamical facilitation is characterized both by a mobility transfer function,
the propensity for highly-mobile regions to arise near regions that were
previously mobile, and by a facilitation volume, the effect of an initial
dynamical event on subsequent dynamics within a region surrounding it.
Sustained bursts of dynamical activity -- avalanches -- are shown to occur in
kinetically constrained models, but, contrary to recent claims, we find that
the decreasing spatiotemporal extent of avalanches with increased supercooling
previously observed in granular experiments does not imply diminishing
facilitation. Viewed within the context of existing simulation and experimental
evidence, our findings show that dynamical facilitation plays a significant
role in the dynamics of systems investigated over the range of state points
accessible to molecular simulations and granular experiments.

open-access femtocell networks. The major challenge in femtocell networks is
interference management which in our system, based on the Long Term Evolution
(LTE) standard, translates to which user should be allocated which physical
resource block (or fraction thereof) from which femtocell access point (FAP).
The globally optimal solution requires integer programming and is
mathematically intractable. We propose a hierarchical three-stage solution:
first, the load of each FAP is estimated considering the number of users
connected to the FAP, their average channel gain and required data rates.
Second, based on each FAP's load, the physical resource blocks (PRBs) are
allocated to FAPs in a manner that minimizes the interference by coloring the
modified interference graph. Finally, the resource allocation is performed at
each FAP considering users' instantaneous channel gain. The two major
advantages of this suboptimal approach are the significantly reduced
computation complexity and the fact that the proposed algorithm only uses
information that is already likely to be available at the nodes executing the
relevant optimization step. The performance of the proposed solution is
evaluated in networks based on the LTE standard.

coloring the conflict graph with physical registers. Such a formulation does
not fully capture the goal of the allocation, which is to minimize the traffic
between registers and memory. Linear scan has been proposed as an alternative
to graph coloring, but in essence, it can be viewed as a greedy algorithm for
graph coloring: coloring the vertices not in the order of their degrees, but in
the order of their occurence in the program. Thus it suffers from almost the
same constraints as graph coloring. In this article, I propose a new method of
register allocation based on the ideas of model transformer semantics (MTS) and
static cache replacement (SCR). Model transformer semantics captures the
semantics of registers and the stack. Static cache replacement relaxes the
assumptions made by graph coloring and linear scan, aiming directly at reducing
register-memory traffic. The method explores a much larger solution space than
that of graph coloring and linear scan, thus providing more opportunities of
optimization. It seamlessly performs live range splitting, an optimization
found in extensions to graph coloring and linear scan. Also, it simplifies the
compiler, and its semantics-based approach provides possibilities of
simplifying the formal verification of compilers.

Decision Process (iMDP) to compute incrementally control policies that
approximate arbitrarily well an optimal policy in terms of the expected cost.
The main idea behind the algorithm is to generate a sequence of finite
discretizations of the original problem through random sampling of the state
space. At each iteration, the discretized problem is a Markov Decision Process
that serves as an incrementally refined model of the original problem. We show
that with probability one, (i) the sequence of the optimal value functions for
each of the discretized problems converges uniformly to the optimal value
function of the original stochastic optimal control problem, and (ii) the
original optimal value function can be computed efficiently in an incremental
manner using asynchronous value iterations. Thus, the proposed algorithm
provides an anytime approach to the computation of optimal control policies of
the continuous problem. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is
demonstrated on motion planning and control problems in cluttered environments

account the presence of correlations in the spatial distribution of charged

scaling of the graphene conductivity can be naturally explained as arising from
impurity correlation effects in the Coulomb disorder, with no need to assume
the presence of short-range scattering centers in addition to charged
impurities. We find that also in bilayer graphene correlations among impurities
induce a crossover of the scaling of the conductivity at higher carrier
densities. We show that in the presence of correlation among charged impurities
the conductivity depends nonlinearly on the impurity density $n_i$ and can even
increase with $n_i$.

of magnitude in density and have a maximum spatial resolution of 0.05 R_sun,
which extends well below the radius of individual protostars and captures their
interaction with the surrounding gas. In analogy to previous studies that
employed sink particles, we find that the Keplerian disc around the primary

by H2 collisional dissociation cooling and collision-induced emission. The
further evolution of the protostellar system is characterized by strong
gravitational torques that transfer angular momentum between the secondary
protostars formed in the disc and the surrounding gas. This leads to the
migration of about half of the secondary protostars to the centre of the cloud
in a free-fall time, where they merge with the primary protostar and enhance
its growth to about five times the mass of the second most massive protostar.
By the same token, a fraction of the protostars obtain angular momentum from
other protostars via N-body interactions and migrate to higher orbits. On
average, only every third protostar survives until the end of the simulation.
However, the number of protostars present at any given time increases
monotonically, suggesting that the system will continue to grow beyond the

eclipsing A star + white dwarf binary with a 5.2 day orbit. Aside from new
spectroscopy covering the orbit of the system, we used 212 days of publicly
available Kepler observations and present the first complete light curve
fitting to these data, modelling the eclipses and transits, ellipsoidal
modulation, reflection, and Doppler beaming. Markov Chain Monte Carlo
simulations are used to determine the system parameters and uncertainty
estimates. Our results are in agreement with earlier studies, except that we
find an inclination of 87.0 \pm 0.4\degree, which is significantly lower than
the previously published value. We find that the mass ratio derived from the
radial velocity amplitude (q=0.104 \pm 0.004) disagrees with that derived from
the ellipsoidal modulation (q=0.052 \pm 0.004} assuming corotation). This was
found before, but with our smaller inclination, the discrepancy is even larger
than previously reported. Accounting for the rapid rotation of the A-star is
found to increase the discrepancy even further by lowering the mass ratio to
q=0.047 \pm 0.004. These results indicate that one has to be extremely careful
in using the amplitude of an ellipsoidal modulation signal in a close binary to
determine the mass ratio, when a proof of corotation is not firmly established.
The radial velocities that can be inferred from the detected Doppler beaming in
the light curve are found to be in agreement with our spectroscopic radial
velocity determination. We also report the first measurement of R{\o}mer delay
in a light curve of a compact binary. This delay amounts to -56 \pm 17 s and is
consistent with the mass ratio derived from the radial velocity amplitude. The
firm establishment of this mass ratio at q=0.104 \pm 0.004 leaves little doubt
that the companion of KOI-74 is a low mass white dwarf.

the Keck II laser guide star adaptive optics (LGS AO) system. We find that the

previous seeing-limited measurements of VLM objects. The two sources with the
largest vsini, LP 349-25B and HD 130948C, are rotating at ~30% of their break
up speed, and are among the most rapidly rotating VLM objects known.
Furthermore, five binary systems, all with orbital semi-major axes <3.5 AU,
have component vsini values that differ by greater than 3sigma. To bring the
binary components with discrepant rotational velocities into agreement would
require the rotational axes to be inclined with respect to each other, and that
at least one component is inclined with respect to the orbital plane.
Alternatively, each component could be rotating at a different rate, even
though they have similar spectral types. Both differing rotational velocities
and inclinations have implications for binary star formation and evolution. We
also investigate possible dynamical evolution in the triple system HD
130948A-BC. The close binary brown dwarfs B and C have significantly different
vsini values. We demonstrate that components B and C could have been torqued
into misalignment by the primary star, A, via orbital precession. Such a
scenario can also be applied to another triple system in our sample, GJ
569A-Bab. Interactions such as these may play an important role in the
dynamical evolution of very low mass binaries. Finally, we note that two of the

by populating dark-matter haloes from a large N-body simulation using halo
occupation prescriptions. We examine the most recent developments in
redshift-space distortions modelling, which account for non-linearities on both
small and intermediate scales produced respectively by randomised motions in
virialised structures and non-linear coupling between the density and velocity

most unbiased estimates of the growth rate of structure, with systematic errors

indicating the appearance of traveling faster than the speed of light. In this
paper, we present a conceptual framework to understand how faster-than-light
events involving neutrinos (as indicated by time-of-flight) might occur. We
propose that observations of this kind do not violate the special theory of
relativity; instead, they only help to provide evidence in support of the
general theory of relativity at quantum scales. Given the relativistic effects
of the neutrino on its local spacetime environment, the measured time-of-flight
at the macroscopic level is attributable to a decrease in the effective path
length traversed by the neutrino. Specifically, along preferred directions, we
show that the Kerr metric allows for the compression of spacetime; hence, the
decreased path length hypothesis is plausible. Furthermore, when the motion of
the neutrino is along the preferred direction for spacetime compression, the
Kerr metric also predicts strong frame dragging effects near the Planck length.
In the region where strong frame dragging occurs, we propose that the
microscopic explanation for the path length compression is due to the formation
of 'micro-wormholes' near the Planck length.

dynamics is even slower than in the usual quantum Griffiths case because the

Both d-wave and s-wave pairing symmetries have been proposed for AFe$_2$Se$_2$,
but a d-wave gap generally has nodes, while experiments clearly point to
no-nodal behavior, and a conventional s-wave gap is inconsistent with the
observation of the neutron resonance below $T_c$. We argue that current
theories of pairing in such systems are incomplete and must include not only
intra-pocket pairing condensate but also inter-pocket condensate made of
fermions belonging to different electron pockets. We analyze the interplay
between intra-pocket and inter-pocket pairing depending on the ellipticity of
electron pockets and the strength of their hybridization and show that
hybridization brings the system into a new $s^{+-}$ state, in which the gap
changes sign between hybridized pockets. This state has the full gap and at the
same time supports spin resonance, in agreement with the data. Near the

another where at each step an edge is chosen uniformly at random from the set
of edges incident on the current vertex, and then transitioned to next vertex.
Central to this thesis is the cover time of the walk, that is, the expectation
of the number of steps required to visit every vertex, maximised over all
starting vertices. In our first contribution, we establish a relation between
the cover times of a pair of graphs, and the cover time of their Cartesian
product. This extends previous work on special cases of the Cartesian product,
in particular, the square of a graph. We show that when one of the factors is
in some sense larger than the other, its cover time dominates, and can become
within a logarithmic factor of the cover time of the product as a whole. Our
main theorem effectively gives conditions for when this holds. The techniques
and lemmas we introduce may be of independent interest. In our second
contribution, we determine the precise asymptotic value of the cover time of a
random graph with given degree sequence. This is a graph picked uniformly at
random from all simple graphs with that degree sequence. We also show that with
high probability, a structural property of the graph called conductance, is
bounded below by a constant. This is of independent interest. Finally, we
explore random walks with weighted random edge choices. We present a weighting
scheme that has a smaller worst case cover time than a simple random walk. We
give an upper bound for a random graph of given degree sequence weighted
according to our scheme. We demonstrate that the speed-up (that is, the ratio
of cover times) over a simple random walk can be unbounded

of holes dominated by photon-assisted hopping, when radiative hole
recombination at one spot produces a photon, whose interband absorption
generates another hole, possibly far away. Due to ""heavy tails"" in the hop
probability, this is a random walk with divergent diffusivity (process known as
the Levy flight). Our key evidence is derived from the ratio of transmitted and
reflected luminescence spectra, measured in samples of different thicknesses.
These experiments prove the non-exponential decay of the hole concentration
from the initial photo-excitation spot. The power-law decay, characteristic of
Levy flights, is steep enough at short distances (steeper than an exponent) to
fit the data for thin samples and slow enough at large distances to account for
thick samples. The high radiative efficiency makes possible a semiconductor
scintillator with efficient photon collection. It is rather unusual that the
material is ""opaque"" at wavelengths of its own scintillation. Nevertheless,
after repeated recycling most photons find their way to one of two photodiodes
integrated on both sides of the semiconductor slab. We present an analytical
model of photon collection in two-sided slab, which shows that the heavy tails
of Levy-flight transport lead to near-ideal characteristics. Finally, we
discuss a possibility to increase the slab thickness while still quantifying
the deposited energy and the interaction position within the slab. The idea is
to use a layered semiconductor with photon-assisted collection of holes in
narrow-bandgap layers spaced by distances far exceeding diffusion length. Holes
collected in these radiative layers emit longwave radiation, to which the
entire structure is transparent. Nearly-ideal calculated characteristics of a
mm-thick layered scintillator can be scaled up to several centimeters.

color confinement below Tc preserves the flavor symmetry. Above Tc, the flavor
symmetry is broken, but the breaking is suppressed by the entanglement between

fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) are not required to be rotationally
invariant, as most variational wavefunctions proposed to date have been.
Instead, they possess a geometric degree of freedom corresponding to a shear
deformation that acts like an intrinsic metric. We apply this idea to a system
with an anisotropic band mass, as is intrinsically the case in many-valley
semiconductors such as AlAs and Si, or in isotropic systems like GaAs in the
presence of a tilted magnetic field, which breaks the rotational invariance. We
perform exact diagonalization calculations with periodic boundary conditions
(torus geometry) for various filling fractions in the lowest, first and second
Landau levels. In the lowest Landau level, we demonstrate that FQHE states
generally survive the breakdown of rotational invariance by moderate values of
the band mass anisotropy. At 1/3 filling, we generate a variational family of
Laughlin wavefunctions parametrized by the metric degree of freedom. We show
that the intrinsic metric of the Laughlin state adjusts as the band mass
anisotropy or the dielectric tensor are varied, while the phase remains robust.
In the n=1 Landau level, mass anisotropy drives transitions between
incompressible liquids and compressible states with charge density wave
ordering. In n>=2 Landau levels, mass anisotropy selects and enhances stripe
ordering with compatible wave vectors at partial 1/3 and 1/2 fillings.

function that is costly to evaluate. We are interested in application scenarios
where concurrent function evaluations are possible. Under such a setting, BO
could choose to either sequentially evaluate the function, one input at a time
and wait for the output of the function before making the next selection, or
evaluate the function at a batch of multiple inputs at once. These two
different settings are commonly referred to as the sequential and batch
settings of Bayesian Optimization. In general, the sequential setting leads to
better optimization performance as each function evaluation is selected with
more information, whereas the batch setting has an advantage in terms of the
total experimental time (the number of iterations). In this work, our goal is
to combine the strength of both settings. Specifically, we systematically
analyze Bayesian optimization using Gaussian process as the posterior estimator
and provide a hybrid algorithm that, based on the current state, dynamically
switches between a sequential policy and a batch policy with variable batch
sizes. We provide theoretical justification for our algorithm and present

dimensional vector obtained from the joint entropies of all non-empty subsets
of the random variables. It is well known that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between such an entropy vector and a certain
group-characterizable vector obtained from a finite group and $n$ of its
subgroups [3]. This correspondence may be useful for characterizing the space
of entropic vectors and for designing network codes. If one restricts attention
to abelian groups then not all entropy vectors can be obtained. This is an
explanation for the fact shown by Dougherty et al [4] that linear network codes
cannot achieve capacity in general network coding problems. All abelian
group-characterizable vectors, and by fiat all entropy vectors generated by
linear network codes, satisfy a linear inequality called the Ingleton
inequality. It is therefore of interest to identify groups that violate the
Ingleton inequality. In this paper, we study the problem of finding nonabelian
finite groups that yield characterizable vectors which violate the Ingleton
inequality. Using a refined computer search, we find the symmetric group $S_5$
to be the smallest group that violates the Ingleton inequality. Careful study
of the structure of this group, and its subgroups, reveals that it belongs to
the Ingleton-violating family $PGL(2,q)$ with a prime power $q \geq 5$, i.e.,
the projective group of $2\times 2$ nonsingular matrices with entries in
$\mathbb{F}_q$. We further interpret this family using the theory of group
actions. We also extend the construction to more general groups such as
$PGL(n,q)$ and $GL(n,q)$. The families of groups identified here are therefore
good candidates for constructing network codes more powerful than linear
network codes, and we discuss some considerations for constructing such group
network codes.

found previously in [1], and compare them to the states that can be identified
in the quasiclassical domain. Exact analysis of the strong-coupling states
shows that not all of them survive when passing to the weak-coupling domain.
Some of the states decay on the curves of the marginal stability (CMS). Thus,
not all strong-coupling states can be analytically continued to weak coupling
to match the observable bound states.
  At weak coupling, we confirm the existence of bound states of
topologically-charged kinks and elementary quanta. Quantization of the U(1)
kink modulus leads to formation of towers of such states. For the Z_N-symmetric
twisted masses their number is by far less than N-1 as was conjectured
previously. We investigate the quasiclassical limit and show that out of N
possible towers only two survive in the spectrum for odd N, and a single tower
for even N. In the case of CP^2 theory the related CMS are discussed in detail.

tin isotopes, there has been a continuous theoretical effort to obtain a
precise description of the experimental results. Up to now, there is no
satisfactory explanation of why the tin nuclei appear to be significantly
softer than 208Pb.
  Purpose: We determine the influence of finite-range and separable pairing
interactions on monopole strength functions in semi-magic nuclei.
  Methods: We employ self-consistently the Quasiparticle Random Phase
Approximation on top of spherical Hartree-Fock-Bogolyubov solutions. We use the
Arnoldi method to solve the linear-response problem with pairing.
  Results: We found that the difference between centroids of Giant Monopole
Resonances measured in lead and tin (about 1 MeV) always turns out to be
overestimated by about 100%. We also found that the volume incompressibility,
obtained by adjusting the liquid-drop expression to microscopic results, is
significantly larger than the infinite-matter incompressibility.
  Conclusions: The zero-range and separable pairing forces cannot induce
modifications of monopole strength functions in tin to match experimental data.

accelerate temporal simulations (through coarse projective integration), and to
implement coarsegrained fixed point algorithms (through matrix-free
Newton-Krylov GMRES). The approach is illustrated through a simple network

results. The scope and applicability of the approach, as well as the issue of

represent regions of interest, edge lengths give travel times between regions,
and the vertex weights give the importance of each region. As the robot
repeatedly performs a closed walk on the graph, we define the weighted latency
of a vertex to be the maximum time between visits to that vertex, weighted by
the importance (vertex weight) of that vertex. Our goal is to find a closed
walk that minimizes the maximum weighted latency of any vertex. We show that
there does not exist a polynomial time algorithm for the problem. We then
provide two approximation algorithms; an $O(\log n)$-approximation algorithm
and an $O(\log \rho_G)$-approximation algorithm, where $\rho_G$ is the ratio
between the maximum and minimum vertex weights. We provide simulation results
which demonstrate that our algorithms can be applied to problems consisting of
thousands of vertices, and a case study for patrolling a city for crime.

trend and instantaneous frequency of nonlinear and non-stationary data. This
method is inspired by the Empirical Mode Decomposition method (EMD) and the
recently developed compressed (compressive) sensing theory. The main idea is to
look for the sparsest representation of multiscale data within the largest
possible dictionary consisting of intrinsic mode functions of the form $\{a(t)
\cos(\theta(t))\}$, where $a \in V(\theta)$, $V(\theta)$ consists of the
functions smoother than $\cos(\theta(t))$ and $\theta'\ge 0$. This problem can
be formulated as a nonlinear $L^0$ optimization problem. In order to solve this
optimization problem, we propose a nonlinear matching pursuit method by
generalizing the classical matching pursuit for the $L^0$ optimization problem.
One important advantage of this nonlinear matching pursuit method is it can be
implemented very efficiently and is very stable to noise. Further, we provide a
convergence analysis of our nonlinear matching pursuit method under certain
scale separation assumptions. Extensive numerical examples will be given to
demonstrate the robustness of our method and comparison will be made with the
EMD/EEMD method. We also apply our method to study data without scale
separation, data with intra-wave frequency modulation, and data with incomplete

the ""bridge orbit bifurcations"" for normal and superdeformed shell structures

shell structures is clearly understood from the contribution of the bridge
orbit to the semiclassical level density. The roles of bridge orbit
bifurcations in the emergence of superdeformed shell structures are also
discussed.

clouds predict relatively high levels of molecular oxygen, O2, and water, H2O.
Contrary to expectation, the space missions SWAS and Odin found only very small
amounts of water vapour and essentially no O2 in the dense star-forming
interstellar medium. Only toward rho Oph A did Odin detect a weak line of O2 at
119 GHz in a beam size of 10 arcmin. A larger telescope aperture such as that
of the Herschel Space Observatory is required to resolve the O2 emission and to
pinpoint its origin. We use the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far Infrared
aboard Herschel to obtain high resolution O2 spectra toward selected positions
in rho Oph A. These data are analysed using standard techniques for O2
excitation and compared to recent PDR-like chemical cloud models. The 487.2GHz
line was clearly detected toward all three observed positions in rho Oph A. In
addition, an oversampled map of the 773.8GHz transition revealed the detection
of the line in only half of the observed area. Based on their ratios, the
temperature of the O2 emitting gas appears to vary quite substantially, with
warm gas (> 50 K) adjacent to a much colder region, where temperatures are
below 30 K. The exploited models predict O2 column densities to be sensitive to
the prevailing dust temperatures, but rather insensitive to the temperatures of
the gas. In agreement with these model, the observationally determined O2
column densities seem not to depend strongly on the derived gas temperatures,
but fall into the range N(O2) = (3 to >6)e15/cm^2. Beam averaged O2 abundances
are about 5e-8 relative to H2. Combining the HIFI data with earlier Odin
observations yields a source size at 119 GHz of about 4 - 5 arcmin,
encompassing the entire rho Oph A core.

in B in fields below a few tens of mT with a crossover to a positive MR at
higher fields, while in a perpendicular current direction we observe a giant

explained by a hopping magneto-conductance via non-zero angular momentum

theory of multi-spinor fields is developed on an algebra, a {\it triplet
algebra}, which consists of all the triple-direct-products of Dirac
\gamma-matrices. The triplet algebra is decomposed into the product of two
subalgebras, an external algebra and an internal algebra, which are exclusively
related with external and internal characteristic of the multi-spinor field
named {\it triplet fields}. All elements of the external algebra which is
isomorphic to the original Dirac algebra $A_\gamma$ are invariant under the
action of permutation group $S_3$ which works to exchange the order of the
$A_\gamma$ elements in the triple-direct-product. The internal algebra is
decomposed into the product of two $4^2$ dimensional algebras, called the
family and color algebras, which describe the family and color degrees of
freedom. The family and color algebras have fine substructures with ""trio plus
solo"" conformations which are irreducible under the action of $S_3$. The
triplet field has trio plus solo family modes with ordinary tricolor quark and
colorless solo lepton components. To incorporate the Weinberg-Salam mechanism,
it is required to introduce two types of triplet fields, a left-handed doublet
and right-handed singlets of electroweak iso-spin. It is possible to qualify
the Yukawa interaction and to make a new interpretation of its coupling
constants naturally in an intrinsic mechanism of the triplet field formalism.
The ordinary Higgs mechanism leads to a new type of the Dirac mass matrices
which can explain all data of quark sector within experimental accuracy.

Liouvillian reversible dynamics. It connects the ratio between the
probabilities of time forward and reversed trajectories to a degree of the time
reversal asymmetry of the final phase space distribution. Indeed, if the final
state is in equilibrium, then the forward and reversed net transition
probabilities are equal, which gives a generalization of the detailed balance
principle. On the other hand, when the external forcing maintains the system
out of equilibrium, it expresses an asymmetry for the probabilities of the time
forward and reversed trajectories. Especially, it gives a microscopic
expression of the heat flowing to a system from a reservoir where the
subdynamics seems like a Markovian stochastic process.
  Also, it turns out that the expression of the microscopic reversibility holds

studies of the structural stability, electronic structure, optical and magnetic
properties of nonmetal-doped TiO$_2$. The first section presents a comparison
study of the structural stability for X-anion and X-cation doped TiO$_2$ (X=B,
C, Si, Ge, N, P, As, Sb, S, Se, Te, F, Cl, Br, and I), which reveals that the
sites of nonmetal dopants (i.e., at O sites or at Ti sites) in TiO$_2$ are
determined by the growth condition of doped TiO$_2$ and the dopants'
electronegativities. The next section reviews the electronic structure, optical
absorption and mechanism of the visible-light photocatalytic activity for
nonmetal-doped TiO$_2$. The third section summarizes the origin of the
spin-polarization and the magnetic coupling character in C- (N- and B-) doped
TiO$_2$.

other to guarantee the stability of the higgs boson mass at one-loop level.
This relation is called the little higgs mechanism. We discuss how accurately
the relation can be tested at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, with especially
focusing on the top sector of the scenario using a method of effective
lagrangian. In order to test the mechanism, it is important to measure the
Yukawa coupling of the top partner. Higgs associated and threshold productions
of the top partner are found to be the best processes for this purpose.

hadronic decay mode of the top quark exclusively, yielding a final state of
three jets with missing transverse energy. The data are consistent with the
standard model; we thus set 95% confidence level upper limits on the cross
section of the process $p\bar{p}\rightarrow t+D$ as a function of the mass of
the dark-matter candidate. The limits are approximately 0.5 pb for a
dark-matter particle with mass in the range of 0-150 GeV/$c^{2}$.

interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom in a triangular lattice for
possible spin liquid-like behaviour. Our effective Hamiltonian describes the
magnetic Cu layer by considering superexchange paths along the intermediate
O's. A mean field study of ordered states reveals an orbitally ordered ground
state that isolates the spin degrees of freedom into spin chains. This scenario
naturally explains the linear specific heat as $T\to 0$ and, by including the
effects of additional defect Cu's sitting off the triangular planes, we find
remarkable agreement with the measured magnetic susceptibility.

Cherenkov light from the air showers of decayed taus produced by tau neutrino
interactions in the Earth. Aiming for the realization of neutrino astronomy
utilizing the Earth-skimming tau neutrino detection technique, highly precise
determination of arrival direction is key due to the following issues: (1)
Clear identification of neutrinos by identifying those vertices originating
within the Earth's surface; (2) Identification of very high energy neutrino
sources. The Ashra detector uses newly developed light collectors which realize
both a 42 degree-diameter field-of-view and arcminute resolution. Therefore, it
has superior angular resolution for imaging Cherenkov air showers. In this
paper, we estimate the sensitivity of and cosmic-ray background resulting from
application of the Ashra-1 Cherenkov tau shower observation method. Both data
from a commissioning run and a long-term observation (with fully equipped
trigger system and one light collector) are presented. Our estimates are based
on a detailed Monte Carlo simulation which describes all relevant shower
processes from neutrino interaction to Cherenkov photon detection produced by
tau air showers. In addition, the potential to determine the arrival direction
of Cherenkov showers is evaluated by using the maximum likelihood method. We
conclude that the Ashra-1 detector is a unique probe into detection of very
high energy neutrinos and their accelerators.

many contemporary researchers as a means of producing systems with iso-damped
closed loop response due to a stepped variation in input. Such systems, with
the closed loop damping remaining invariant to gain changes can be used to
produce dead-beat step response with only rise time varying with gain. This
technique is used to achieve an active step-back in a Pressurized Heavy Water
Reactor (PHWR) where it is desired to change the reactor power to a
pre-determined value within a short interval keeping the power undershoot as
low as possible. This paper puts forward an approach as an alternative for the
present day practice of a passive step-back mechanism where the control rods
are allowed to drop during a step-back action by gravity, with release of
electromagnetic clutches. The reactor under a step-back condition is identified
as a system using practical test data and a suitable Proportional plus Integral
plus Derivative (PID) controller is designed for it. Then the combined plant is
augmented with a phase shaper to achieve a dead-beat response in terms of power
drop. The fact that the identified static gain of the system depends on the
initial power level at which a step-back is initiated, makes this application
particularly suited for using a FO phase shaper. In this paper, a model of a
nuclear reactor is developed for a control rod drop scenario involving rapid
power reduction in a 500MWe Canadian Deuterium Uranium (CANDU) reactor using
AutoRegressive Exogenous (ARX) algorithm. The system identification and reduced
order modeling are developed from practical test data. For closed loop active
control of the identified reactor model, the fractional order phase shaper
along with a PID controller is shown to perform better than the present Reactor
Regulating System (RRS) due to its iso-damped nature.
