the absolute magnitude variation as a function of metallicity. When we examined
the metallicity distribution of SDSS stars, after correcting for the different
volumes sampled by the magnitude-limited survey, we found that there is an M
dwarf problem, with the number of M dwarfs at [Fe/H] ~ -0.5 less than 1% the

predicts a more gradual drop in star numbers with decreasing metallicity.

  feedback",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the online linear optimization problem with bandit feedback. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we provide an algorithm (based on exponential
weights) with a regret of order $\sqrt{d n \log N}$ for any finite action set
with $N$ actions, under the assumption that the instantaneous loss is bounded
by 1. This shaves off an extraneous $\sqrt{d}$ factor compared to previous
works, and gives a regret bound of order $d \sqrt{n \log n}$ for any compact
set of actions. Without further assumptions on the action set, this last bound
is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Interestingly, our result also
shows that the minimax regret for bandit linear optimization with expert advice
in $d$ dimension is the same as for the basic $d$-armed bandit with expert
advice. Our second contribution is to show how to use the Mirror Descent
algorithm to obtain computationally efficient strategies with minimax optimal
regret bounds in specific examples. More precisely we study two canonical
action sets: the hypercube and the Euclidean ball. In the former case, we
obtain the first computationally efficient algorithm with a $d \sqrt{n}$
regret, thus improving by a factor $\sqrt{d \log n}$ over the best known result
for a computationally efficient algorithm. In the latter case, our approach
gives the first algorithm with a $\sqrt{d n \log n}$ regret, again shaving off
an extraneous $\sqrt{d}$ compared to previous works.

  Astrophysical Journal",,"10.1088/0004-637X/755/2/121",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A collisionless shock may be strongly modified by the presence of neutral
atoms through the processes of charge exchange between ions and neutrals and
ionization of the latter. These two processes lead to exchange of energy and
momentum between charged and neutral particles both upstream and downstream of
the shock. In particular, neutrals that suffer a charge exchange downstream
with shock-heated ions generate high velocity neutrals that have a finite
probability of returning upstream. These neutrals might then deposit heat in
the upstream plasma through ionization and charge exchange, thereby reducing
the fluid Mach number. A consequence of this phenomenon, that we refer to as
the ""neutral return flux"", is a reduction of the shock compression factor and
the formation of a shock precursor upstream. The scale length of the precursor
is determined by the ionization and charge exchange interaction lengths of fast
neutrals moving towards upstream infinity. In the case of a shock propagating
in the interstellar medium, the effects of ion-neutral interactions are
especially important for shock velocities < 3000 km/s. Such propagation
velocities are common among shocks associated with supernova remnants, the
primary candidate sources for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. We then
investigate the effects of the return flux of neutrals on the spectrum of
test-particles accelerated at the shock. We find that, for shocks slower than
~3000 km/s, the particle energy spectrum steepens appreciably with respect to
the naive expectation for a strong shock, namely E^-2.

mechanism of energy dissipation in the flow is assumed to be the viscosity and
the magnetic diffusivity due to turbulence in the accretion flow. It is also
assumed that the magnetic diffusivity and the kinematic viscosity are not
constant and vary by position and $\alpha$-prescription is used for them. The
influence of outflow emanating from accretion disc is considered as a sink for
mass, angular momentum and energy. The self-similar method is used to solve the
integrated equations that govern the behavior of the accretion flow in the
presence of outflow. The solutions represent the disc which rotates faster and
becomes cooler for stronger outflows. Moreover, by adding the magnetic
diffusivity, the surface density and rotational velocity decrease, while the
radial velocity and temperature increase. The study of present model with the
magnitude of magnetic field implies that the disc rotates and accretes faster
and becomes hotter, while the surface density decreases. The disc thickness
increases by adding the magnetic field or resistivity, while it becomes thinner

first time, we derive the relations between galaxy size, mass, and internal
velocity, and the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, from a statistically
representative sample of star-forming galaxies. We find a dynamical mass that
agrees with those of rotating galaxies containing a gas fraction of ~20%,
perfectly consistent with the content derived using the Kennicutt-Schmidt
formulation and the expected evolution. Non-rotating galaxies have more compact
sizes for their stellar component, and are less massive than rotators, but do
not have statistically different sizes for their gas-component. We measure a
marginal evolution in the size-stellar mass and size-velocity relations in
which discs become evenly smaller with cosmic time at fixed stellar mass or
velocity, and are less massive at a given velocity than in the local Universe.
The scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation is smaller when we introduce the S05
index, which we interpret as evidence of an increase in the contribution to
galactic kinematics of turbulent motions with cosmic time. We report a
persistently large scatter for rotators in our relations, that we suggest is
intrinsic, and possibly caused by complex physical mechanism(s) at work in our
stellar mass/luminosity regime and redshift range. Our results consistently
point towards a mild, net evolution of these relations, comparable to those
predicted by cosmological simulations of disc formation for at least 8Gyr and a
dark halo strongly coupled with galactic spectrophotometric properties.

the convex set of states because the image contains states of reduced support,
while this map restricts to a smooth parametrization of a Gibbsian family of
fully supported states. Here we prove for arbitrary ranking functions that the
inference is continuous up to boundary points. This follows from a continuity
condition in terms of the openness of the restricted linear map from states to
their expected values. The openness condition shows also that ranking functions
with a discontinuous inference are typical. Moreover it shows that the
inference is continuous in the restriction to any polytope which implies that a
discontinuity belongs to the quantum domain of non-commutative observables and
that a geodesic closure of a Gibbsian family equals the set of maximum-entropy
states. We discuss eight descriptions of the set of maximum-entropy states with

valence-bond-solid (VBS) ordering in the ground state of an S=1/2
square-lattice quantum spin model---the J-Q model, in which 4- or 6-spin
interactions Q are added to the Heisenberg exchange J. Ground state results for
finite systems (with up to thousands of spins) are obtained using a projector
QMC method. Great care has to be taken when extrapolating the order parameter
to infinite size, in particular in cylinder geometry. Even though strong 2D VBS
order exists and is established clearly with increasing system size on L*L
lattices (or Lx* Ly lattices with a fixed Lx/Ly), only short-range VBS
correlations are observed on long cylinders (when Lx -> infinity at fixed Ly).
The correlation length increases with Ly, until long-range order sets in at a
""critical"" Ly. This width is large even when the 2D order is strong, e.g, for a
system where the order parameter is 70% of the largest possible value, Ly=8 is
required for ordering. Correlation functions for small L*L lattices can also be
misleading. For a 20%-ordered system results for L up to 20 appear to
extrapolate to a vanishing order parameter, while for larger L the behavior
crosses over and extrapolates to a non-zero value (with exponentially small
finite size corrections). The VBS order also exhibits interesting edge effects
related to emergent U(1) symmetry, which, if not considered properly, can lead
to wrong conclusions for the thermodynamic limit. The finite-size behavior for
small L*L lattices and long cylinders is similar to that predicted for a Z2
spin liquid. The results raise concerns about recent works claiming Z2 spin
liquid ground states in frustrated 2D systems, in particular, the Heisenberg
model with nearest and next-nearest-neighbor couplings. VBS state in this

couple the system to a Z_2 gauge field and then show that the \pi-flux
excitations have different braiding statistics from that of a usual paramagnet.
In addition, we show that these braiding statistics directly imply the
existence of protected edge modes. Finally, we analyze a particular microscopic
model for the edge and derive a field theoretic description of the low energy
excitations. We believe that the braiding statistics approach outlined in this
paper can be generalized to a large class of symmetry-protected topological
phases.

required an equidistant unperturbed spectrum. Here, we pursue two goals: First,
we extend its applicability to non-equidistant spectra with the particular
focus on an efficient derivation of the differential flow equations, which
define the enhanced perturbative continuous unitary transformation (epCUT).
Second, we show that the numerical integration of the flow equations yields a
robust scheme to extract data from the epCUT. The method is illustrated by the
perturbation of the harmonic oscillator with a quartic term and of the two-leg
spin ladders in the strong-rung-coupling limit for uniform and alternating rung
couplings. The latter case provides an example of perturbation around a
non-equidistant spectrum.

sparse random graphs. This concerns the convergence of the logarithm of number
of homomorphisms from graphs or hyper-graphs $\G_N, N\ge 1$ to some target
graph $W$. The theory of dense graph convergence, including random dense
graphs, is now well understood, but its counterpart for sparse random graphs
presents some fundamental difficulties. Phrased in the statistical physics
terminology, the issue is the existence of the log-partition function limits,
also known as free energy limits, appropriately normalized for the Gibbs
distribution associated with $W$. In this paper we prove that the sequence of
sparse \ER graphs is right-converging when the tensor product associated with
the target graph $W$ satisfies certain convexity property. We treat the case of
discrete and continuous target graphs $W$. The latter case allows us to prove a
special case of Talagrand's recent conjecture (more accurately stated as level
III Research Problem 6.7.2 in his recent book), concerning the existence of the
limit of the measure of a set obtained from $\R^N$ by intersecting it with
linearly in $N$ many subsets, generated according to some common probability
law.
  Our proof is based on the interpolation technique, introduced first by Guerra
and Toninelli and developed further in a series of papers. Specifically, Bayati
et al establish the right-convergence property for Erdos-Renyi graphs for some
special cases of $W$. In this paper most of the results in this paper follow as
a special case of our main theorem.

Hence their integrated fluxes and colors can be affected by the random presence
of a few bright stars introduced by stochastic sampling of the stellar mass
function. Specific methods are being developed to extend the analysis of
cluster SEDs into the low-mass regime. In this paper, we apply such a method to
observations of star clusters, in the nearby spiral galaxy M83. We reassess
ages and masses of a sample of 1242 objects for which UBVIHalpha fluxes were
obtained with the HST/WFC3 images. Synthetic clusters with known properties are
used to characterize the limitations of the method. The ensemble of color
predictions of the discrete cluster models are in good agreement with the
distribution of observed colors. We emphasize the important role of the Halpha
data in the assessment of the fraction of young objects, particularly in
breaking the age-extinction degeneracy that hampers an analysis based on UBVI
only. We find the mass distribution of the cluster sample to follow a power-law
of index -2.1 +/-0.2, and the distribution of ages a power-law of index -1.0
+/-0.2 for M > 10^3.5 Msun and ages between 10^7 and 10^9 yr. An extension of
our main method, that makes full use of the probability distributions of age
and mass of the individual clusters, is explored. It produces similar power-law
slopes and will deserve further investigation. Although the properties derived
for individual clusters significantly differ from those obtained with
traditional, non-stochastic models in ~30% of the objects, the first order
aspect of the age and mass distributions are similar to those obtained
previously for this M83 sample in the range of overlap of the studies. We
extend the power-law description to lower masses with better mass and age
resolution and without most of the artifacts produced by the classical method.

condition is attained by exposing halos to a strong (J_21 > 10^3) Lyman-Werner
UV background produced by both accreting BHs and stars, thus establishing a
self-regulated growth regime. We find that this condition is met already at z
close to 18 in the highly biased regions in which quasars are born. The key
parameter allowing the formation of SMBHs by z=6-7 is the fraction of halos
that can form heavy seeds: the minimum requirement is that f_heavy>0.001; SMBH
as large as 2x10^10 Msol can be obtained when f_heavy approaches unity.
Independently of f_heavy, the model produces a high-z stellar bulge-black hole
mass relation which is steeper than the local one, implying that SMBHs formed
before their bulge was in place. The formation of heavy seeds, allowed by the
Lyman-Werner radiative feedback in the quasar-forming environment, is crucial
to achieve a fast growth of the SMBH by merger events in the early phases of
its evolution, i.e. z>7. The UV photon production is largely dominated by stars
in galaxies, i.e. black hole accretion radiation is sub-dominant.
Interestingly, we find that the final mass of light BHs and of the SMBH in the
quasar is roughly equal by z=6; by the same time only 19% of the initial baryon
content has been converted into stars. The SMBH growth is dominated at all
epochs z > 7.2 by mergers (exceeding accretion by a factor 2-50); at later
times accretion becomes by far the most important growth channel. We finally
discuss possible shortcomings of the model.

z=1 for high \sigma_8 cosmologies (WMAP1 & WMAP7), but the predictions from a
low \sigma_8 cosmology (WMAP3) are significantly lower than the data at z=0. We

star formation is too efficient in low-mass haloes or tidal stripping is too
inefficient at high redshift. Our results show that galaxy clustering is
strongly affected by the models for galaxy formation, thus can be used to

outburst luminosity of 1-2*10^38 erg/s in the 0.5-7.0 keV band before returning
to quiescence. Such luminosities are possible for both stellar-mass black hole
and neutron star X-ray binary transients. Here, we attempt to characterize the
nature of the compact object. No counterpart has been detected in the optical

possibility of an obscured companion. The brightness of the source after a >100

non-ULX black hole system in outburst to be subject to detailed spectral
modeling outside the Local Group, or a bright (>10^38 erg/s) transient neutron

theory of quantum gravity in any dimension D. The theory presents two entire
functions, a.k.a. ""form factors"", and a finite number of local operators
required by the quantum consistency of the theory itself. The main reason to
introduce the entire functions is to avoid ghosts (states of negative norm)
like the one in the four-dimensional Stelle's theory. The new theory is indeed
ghost-free since the two entire functions have the property to generalize the
Einstein-Hilbert action without introducing new poles in the propagator. The
theory is renormalizable at one loop and finite from two loops upward. In this
paper we essentially study three classes of form factors, systematically
showing the tree-level unitarity. We prove that the gravitation potential is
regular in r = 0 for all the choices of form factors compatible with
renormalizability and unitarity. We also include Black hole spherical symmetric
solutions omitting higher curvature corrections to the equation of motions. For
two out of three form factors the solutions are regular and the classical
singularity is replaced by a ""de Sitter-like core"" in r=0. For one particular
choice of the form factors, we prove that the D-dimensional ""Newtonian
cosmology"" is singularity-free and the Universe spontaneously follows a de
Sitter evolution at the ""Planck scale"" for any matter content. We conclude the
article stating that, in the ultraviolet regime, the spectral dimension takes
on different values for the three cases: less than or equal to ""1"" for the
first case, ""0"" for the second one and ""2"" for the third one. Once the class of
theories compatible with renormalizability and unitarity is defined, the
spectral dimension has the same short-distance ""critical value"" or
""accumulation point"" for any value of the topological dimension D.

spectral analysis is not conclusive on the origin of the bulk of the X-ray
emission. In order to examine the jet contribution to the X-ray flux, we model
the quasar spectral energy distribution (SED), adopting several scenarios for
the jet emission. For the values of the main physical parameters favored by the
observables, a dominant role of the jet emission in the X-ray band is ruled out
when a single zone (leptonic) scenario is adopted, even including the
contribution of the external photon fields as seed photons for inverse Compton
emission. We then consider a structured jet, with the blazar component that-
although not directly visible in the X-ray band - provides an intense field of
seed synchrotron photons Compton-scattered by electrons in a mildly
relativistic knot. In this case the whole X-ray emission can be accounted for
if we assume a blazar luminosity within the range observed from flat spectrum
radio quasars. The X-ray radiative efficiency of such (structured) jet is
intimately related to the presence of a complex velocity structure. The jet
emission can provide a significant contribution in X-rays if it decelerates
within the host galaxy, on kiloparsec scales. We discuss the implications of
this model in terms of jet dynamics and interaction with the ambient medium.

area, independent of the temperature, while the high-temperature blackbody has
a much smaller area and shows an anti-correlation between emission area and
temperature. We compare the properties of these bursts with bursts observed
from other SGR sources during extreme activations, and discuss the implications
of our results in the context of magnetar burst models.

that the length scale of the wrinkles tends to zero with vanishing thickness of

we focus on the wrinkling of an annular sheet loaded in the radial direction

identification of the scaling law of the minimum energy as the thickness of the

Kirchhoff-Love setting and then in the nonlinear three-dimensional setting. To
obtain the optimal upper bound, we need to adjust a naive construction (one
family of wrinkles superimposed on a planar deformation) by introducing a
cascade of wrinkles. The lower bound is more subtle, since it must be

social networks ubiquitous, and also given researchers access to massive

of evidence for studying dynamics of individual and group behavior, the
structure of networks and global patterns of the flow of information on them.
However, in most previous studies, the structure of the underlying networks was
not directly visible but had to be inferred from the flow of information from
one individual to another. As a result, we do not yet understand dynamics of
information spread on networks or how the structure of the network affects it.
We address this gap by analyzing data from two popular social news sites.
Specifically, we extract follower graphs of active Digg and Twitter users and
track how interest in news stories cascades through the graph. We compare and
contrast properties of information cascades on both sites and elucidate what
they tell us about dynamics of information flow on networks.

$G$-asymmetry which is information-theoretic and which was thus far lacking. In
particular, we show that in the limit of many copies of the bounded-size
quantum reference frame, the accessible information approaches the Holevo
bound. This implies that the rate of alignment of reference frames, measured by
the (linearized) accessible information per system, is equal to the
regularized, linearized $G$-asymmetry. The latter quantity is equal to the
number variance in the case where $G=U(1)$. Quite surprisingly, for the case
where $G=\mathbb{Z}_{M}$ and $M\geq 4$, it is equal to a quantity that is not
additive in general, but instead can be superadditive under tensor product of
two distinct bounded-size reference frames. This remarkable phenomenon is
purely quantum and has no classical analog.

a large number of kicks. Higher order quantum resonant effects corresponding to
the fractional Talbot time of (1/4)$T_{T}$ and (1/5)$T_{T}$ for five and ten

of the conditions for consensus proposed in the literature can be directly

consensus is algorithmically decidable. Direct verification of the avoiding set

{\neq} 1 yields nonlinear physics, which turn out to be quite rich and directly
related to what is nowadays referred to as complexity, or complex systems. We
first discuss a few central points like the distinction between additivity and
extensivity, and the Central Limit Theorem as well as the large-deviation
theory. Then we comment the case of gravitation (which within the present
context corresponds to q {\neq} 1, and to similar nonlinear approaches), with
special focus onto the entropy of black holes. Finally we briefly focus on
recent nonlinear generalizations of the Schroedinger, Klein-Gordon and Dirac
equations, and mention various illustrative predictions, verifications and
applications within physics (in both low- and high-energy regimes) as well as
out of it.

generalizing the results in \cite{TW}. We further study the behavior of the
minimum singular value of these random matrices. In particular, we prove that
the minimum singular value is at most $N\exp(-C\sqrt{N}))$ with high
probability where $C$ is a constant independent on $N$. Furthermore, the value
of the constant $C$ is determined explicitly. The main result is obtained in
two different ways. One approach uses techniques from stochastic processes and
in particular, a construction related to the Brownian bridge. The other one is
a more direct analytical approach involving combinatorics and complex analysis.
As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for the maximum absolute value of a
random complex polynomial on the unit circle, which may be of independent
mathematical interest. Lastly, for each sequence of positive integers
${k_p}_{p=1}^{\infty}$ we present a generalized version of the previously
discussed matrices. The classical random Vandermonde matrix corresponds to the

common phenomena, producing structures far from regular or random. Clustering,
community structure and assortative mixing by degree are perhaps among most
prominent examples of the latter. Although generally accepted for social
networks, these properties only partially explain the structure of other
networks. We first show that degree-corrected clustering is in contrast to
standard definition highly assortative. Yet interesting on its own, we further
note that non-social networks contain connected regions with very low
clustering. Hence, the structure of real-world networks is beyond communities.
We here investigate the concept of functional modules---groups of regularly
equivalent nodes---and show that such structures could explain for the
properties observed in non-social networks. Real-world networks might be
composed of functional modules that are overlaid by communities. We support the
latter by proposing a simple network model that generates scale-free
small-world networks with tunable clustering and degree mixing. Model has a
natural interpretation in many real-world networks, while it also gives
insights into an adequate community extraction framework. We also present an
algorithm for detection of arbitrary structural modules without any prior
knowledge. Algorithm is shown to be superior to state-of-the-art, while
application to real-world networks reveals well supported composites of
different structural modules that are consistent with the underlying systems.
Clear functional modules are identified in all types of networks including
social. Our findings thus expose functional modules as another key ingredient

This state of affairs tends to favor fossil fuel generation over renewable
sources. Because of the technological difficulties of storing electric energy,
the quest for mechanisms that would make the demand for electricity
controllable on a day-to-day basis is gaining prominence. The goal of this
paper is to provide one such mechanisms, which we call Digital Direct Load
Scheduling (DDLS). DDLS is a direct load control mechanism in which we unbundle
individual requests for energy and digitize them so that they can be
automatically scheduled in a cellular architecture. Specifically, rather than
storing energy or interrupting the job of appliances, we choose to hold
requests for energy in queues and optimize the service time of individual
appliances belonging to a broad class which we refer to as ""deferrable loads"".
The function of each neighborhood scheduler is to optimize the time at which
these appliances start to function. This process is intended to shape the
aggregate load profile of the neighborhood so as to optimize an objective
function which incorporates the spot price of energy, and also allows
distributed energy resources to supply part of the generation dynamically.

powerful diagnostic of conditions in X-ray emitting gas surrounding massive
stars. Recent observations indicate that these ratios can be variable with
time.
  The possible causes of variation in line ratios are limited: changes in the
radiation field or changes in density, and changes in mass-loss or geometry. In
this paper, we investigate the ability of changes in the radiation field to
induce variability in the ratio R=f/i.
  To isolate the radiative effect, we use a heuristic model of temperature and
radius changes in variable stars in the B and O range with low-density,
steady-state winds. We model the changes in emissivity of X-ray emitting gas
close to the star due to differences in level-pumping from available UV photons
at the location of the gas.
  We find that under these conditions, variability in R is dominated by the
stellar temperature. Although the relative amplitude of variability is roughly
comparable for most lines at most temperatures, detectable variations are
limited to a few lines for each spectral type. We predict that variable values
in R due to stellar variability must follow predictable trends found in our
simulations.
  Our model uses radial pulsations as a mode of stellar variability that
maximizes the amplitude of variation in R. This model is robust enough to show
which ions will provide the best opportunity for observing variability in the
f/i ratio at different stellar temperatures, and the correlation of that
variability with other observable parameters. In real systems, the effects
would be more complex than in our model, with differences in phase and
suppressed amplitude in the presence of non-radial pulsations. This suggests
that changes in R across many lines concurrently are not likely to be produced
by a variable radiation field.

technique, we investigated the sources of CH3OH and HCN in comet 103P/Hartley
2, the target of NASA's EPOXI mission, which had an exceptionally favorable
apparition in late 2010. Our monitoring with the IRAM 30 m telescope shows
short-term variability of the spectral lines caused by nucleus rotation. The
varying production rates generate changes in brightness by a factor of 4 for
HCN and by a factor of 2 for CH3OH, and they are remarkably well correlated in
time. With the addition of the velocity information from the line profiles, we
identify the main sources of outgassing: two jets, oppositely directed in a
radial sense, and icy grains, injected into the coma primarily through one of
the jets. The mixing ratio of CH3OH and HCN is dramatically different in the
two jets, which evidently shows large-scale chemical heterogeneity of the
nucleus. We propose a network of identities linking the two jets with
morphological features reported elsewhere, and postulate that the chemical
heterogeneity may result from thermal evolution. The model-dependent average
production rates are 3.5x10**26 molec/s for CH3OH and 1.25x10**25 molec/s for
HCN, and their ratio of 28 is rather high but not abnormal. The rotational
temperature from CH3OH varied strongly, presumably due to nucleus rotation,

a cool (with a temperature T = 2.0-2.2 keV) and a hot (T = 5.0-5.7 keV)
component that coexist and dominate the X-ray emission at least in the central
80 kpc. A third weak emission component (T = 0.8 keV) is also detected within
the innermost 144 kpc and is ascribed to a portion of inter-stellar medium
(ISM) of the cD galaxy. Deprojected spectral analysis reveals flat radial
temperature distributions for both the hot phase and cool phase components.
These results are consistent with the ASCA measurements reported in Xu et al.

proof is given, via complex number GCD, of the previously known result that any
Heronian triangle may be embedded in the Cartesian lattice Z^2; it is then
shown that, for a proper triangle, such an embedding is unique modulo lattice
isometry; finally the method is extended via quaternion GCD to tetrahedra in
Z^3, where uniqueness no longer obtains, and embeddings also exist which are
unobtainable by this construction. The requisite complex and quaternionic
number theoretic background is summarised beforehand. Subsequent sections
engage with subsidiary implementation issues: initial rational embedding,
canonical reduction, exhaustive search for embeddings additional to those
yielded via GCD; and illustrative numerical examples are provided. A
counter-example shows that this approach must fail in higher dimensional space.

appear to have stopped accreting gas from the intergalactic medium and are
fossilized systems with their stars undergoing slow internal evolution. For a
wide variety of infall histories of unprocessed baryonic matter to feed star
formation, most of the observed MDs can be well described by our model. The key
requirement is that the fraction of the gas mass lost by supernova-driven
outflows is close to unity. This model also predicts a relationship between the
total stellar mass and the mean metallicity for dSphs in accord with properties
of their dark matter halos. The model further predicts as a natural consequence
that the abundance ratios [E/Fe] for elements such as O, Mg, and Si decrease
for stellar populations at the higher end of the [Fe/H] range in a dSph. We
show that for infall rates far below the net rate of gas loss to star formation
and outflows, the MD in our model is very sharply peaked at one [Fe/H] value,
similar to what is observed in most globular clusters. This suggests that
globular clusters may be end members of the same family as dSphs.

effectively stronger near the edge sites because the coordination number is

coupling strengths. However, we find no signs for ""edge Mott insulating states""

sequential loops, each iterate will only depend directly on a subset of the
previous iterates (i.e. knowing that any one of a vertices neighbors is in the
MIS or knowing that it has no previous neighbors is sufficient to decide its

  In this paper, we show that for any graph, and for a random ordering of the

the turbulent properties of the collapsing cloud. In particular, we explore the
effect of varying the initial strength and injection scale of turbulence and
the initial uniform rotation of the collapsing magnetised cloud. In order to
follow the evolution of the magnetic field in both the kinematic and the
nonlinear regime, we choose an initial field strength of $\simeq 1\,\mkG$ with
the magnetic to kinetic energy ratio, $E_{\rm m}/E_{\rm k} \sim 10^{-4}$. Both
gravitational compression and the small-scale dynamo initially amplify the
magnetic field. Further into the evolution, the dynamo-generated magnetic field
saturates but the total magnetic field continues to grow because of
compression. The saturation of the small-scale dynamo is marked by a change in
the slope of $B/\rho^{2/3}$ and by a shift in the peak of the magnetic energy
spectrum from small scales to larger scales. For the range of initial Mach
numbers explored in this study, the dynamo growth rate increases as the Mach
number increases from $v_{\rm rms}/c_{\rm s}\sim 0.2$ to 0.4 and then starts
decreasing from $v_{\rm rms}/c_{\rm s}\sim 1.0$. We obtain saturation values of
$E_{\rm m}/E_{\rm k} = 0.2 - 0.3$ for these runs. Simulations with different
initial injection scales of turbulence also show saturation at similar levels.
For runs with different initial rotation of the cloud, the magnetic energy
saturates at $E_{\rm m}/E_{\rm k}\sim 0.2 - 0.4$ of the equipartition value.

fluid-dynamical prognostic models of wildfire spread and behavior that attempt
an almost complete representation of fire-atmosphere interactions. This level
of fidelity however means that these models cannot be used operationally. The
reason is that, despite ever increasing computational resources, the complexity

strikes a balance between fidelity and speed of execution. The feasibility of

set of the ground states is in one to one correspondence (up to a global
rotation) with the non-crossing loop coverings of the three equivalent
honeycomb sublattices into which the bonds of the triangular lattice can be
partitioned. This allows one to identify the order parameter space as an
infinite Cayley tree with coordination number 3. Building on the duality
between a similar loop model and the ferromagnetic O(3) model on the honeycomb
lattice, we argue that a typical ground state should have long-range order in
terms of spin orientation. This conclusion is further supported by the
comparison with the four-state antiferromagnetic Potts model [describing the
case when the angle between neighboring spins is equal to arccos(-1/3)], which
at zero temperature is critical and in terms of the solid-on-solid
representation is located exactly at the point of roughening transition. At
other values of the angle between neighboring spins an additional constraint
appears, whose presence drives the system into an ordered phase (unless this
angle is equal to pi/2, when another constraint is removed and the model

Heston model. We base our algorithms on the Broadie-Kaya algorithm, an exact
simulation scheme for the Heston model. As the joint transition densities are
not available in closed-form, the Linear Transformation method due to Imai and
Tan, a popular and widely applicable method to improve the effectiveness of
quasi-Monte Carlo methods, cannot be employed in the context of path-dependent
options when the underlying price process follows the Heston model.
Consequently, we tailor quasi-Monte Carlo methods directly to the Heston model.
The contributions of the paper are threefold: We firstly show how to apply
quasi-Monte Carlo methods in the context of the Heston model and the SVJ model,
secondly that quasi-Monte Carlo methods improve on Monte Carlo methods, and
thirdly how to improve the effectiveness of quasi-Monte Carlo methods by using
bridge constructions tailored to the Heston and SVJ models. Finally, we provide
some extensions for computing greeks, barrier options, multidimensional and
multi-asset pricing, and the 3/2 model.

of a matrix in a numerically robust way. Different adaptions of the Arnoldi
method are often used to compute partial Schur factorizations. We propose here
a technique to compute a partial Schur factorization of a nonlinear eigenvalue
problem (NEP). The technique is inspired by the algorithm in [8], now called
the infinite Arnoldi method. The infinite Arnoldi method is a method designed
for NEPs, and can be interpreted as Arnoldi's method applied to a linear
infinite-dimensional operator, whose reciprocal eigenvalues are the solutions
to the NEP. As a first result we show that the invariant pairs of the operator
are equivalent to invariant pairs of the NEP. We characterize the structure of
the invariant pairs of the operator and show how one can carry out a
modification of the infinite Arnoldi method by respecting the structure. This
also allows us to naturally add the feature known as locking. We nest this
algorithm with an outer iteration, where the infinite Arnoldi method for a
particular type of structured functions is appropriately restarted. The
restarting exploits the structure and is inspired by the well-known implicitly
restarted Arnoldi method for standard eigenvalue problems. The final algorithm
is applied to examples from a benchmark collection, showing that both
processing time and memory consumption can be considerably reduced with the
restarting technique.

eigenmode spectrum shows anticrossings between the plasma mode of the shunted
junction and the odd resonator modes. Notably, we find that the combined device
can inherit the complete nonlinearity of the junction, allowing for a
description as a harmonic oscillator with a Kerr nonlinearity. Using a dc SQUID
instead of a single junction, the nonlinearity can be tuned between 10 kHz and
4 MHz while maintaining resonance frequencies of a few gigahertz for realistic
device parameters. An array of such nonlinear resonators can be considered a
scalable superconducting quantum simulator for a Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian. The
device would be capable of accessing the strongly correlated regime and be
particularly well suited for investigating quantum many-body dynamics of
interacting particles under the influence of drive and dissipation.

objectives regarding geodesy, geophysics and fundamental physics. In the
neighborhood of Mercury, the s/c will experience strong solar radiation
pressure torques; the s/c attitude is controlled by inertial wheels that after
some time reach their maximum rotation state. Then they have to be slowed down
by means of thruster pulses, inducing a residual acceleration on the s/c, with
a desaturation (or off-loading) maneuver. In this paper, we will show how such
maneuvers affect the orbit of the s/c and the radio science measurements and,
also, how to include them in the orbit determination and parameter estimation

observational arcs separated by intervals of time where the probe is not

performed per day, one during the observing session, the other in the dark. To

deterministic propagation of the orbit, which is able to deal with these

numerical simulations we will show demonstrate that this constrained multi-arc
strategy is able to determine the maneuvers, including the ones in the dark,
together with the other parameters of interest at a high level of accuracy. The

signature. These observations are extremely challenging and push the limits of
current instrumentation, but have the potential to provide long-awaited
observational support for the magneto-centrifugal mechanism of jet launching in
which jets remove angular momentum from protostellar systems. We successfully
detect all five jet targets (from RW Aur, HN Tau, DP Tau and CW Tau) in several
near-ultraviolet emission lines, including the strong Mg II doublet. However,
only RW Aur's bipolar jet presents sufficient signal-to-noise for analysis. The
approaching jet lobe shows a difference of 10 km/s in a direction which agrees
with the disk rotation sense, but is opposite to previously published optical
measurements for the receding jet. The near-ultraviolet difference is not found
six months later, nor is it found in the fainter receding jet. Overall, in the
case of RW Aur, differences are not consistent with a simple jet rotation
interpretation. Indeed, given the renowned complexity and variability of this
system, it now seems likely that any rotation signature is confused by other
influences, with the inevitable conclusion that RW Aur is not suited to a jet

not aim to protect information about an individual that can be uncovered even

providing protection to sensitive information, by which we refer to the answers

protection. Our method is developed with another goal which is to provide
differential privacy guarantee, and for that we introduce a more refined form

technique and the regularized equation of state (mean-field + second-order

advantage of this procedure, with respect to a cutoff regularization, is to
provide a unique set of parameters for the adjusted effective interaction. This
occurs because the regularized second-order correction does not contain any

force between static quarks. They are found to be consistent with those
inferred from the quarkonium spectrum and the Regge trajectories of hadrons. By
using the same Lagrangian, the critical temperature of the QCD phase transition
is estimated, and a non-trivial flavor dependence is predicted. We also discuss
a possible connection between the Seiberg duality and the magnetic model we
studied.

find that if m_h ~ 125 GeV focus-point strips would be disfavoured, as would
the low-tan beta stau-chi and stop -chi coannihilation strips, whereas the
stau-chi coannihilation strip at large tan beta and A_0 > 0 would be favoured,
together with its extension to a funnel where rapid annihilation via
direct-channel H/A poles dominates. On the other hand, if m_h ~ 119 GeV more
options would be open. We give parametrizations of WMAP strips with large tan

given rise to several generalizations, such as association schemes. Motivated
by spectral and other algebraic characterizations of distance-regular graphs,
we study `almost distance-regular graphs'. We use this name informally for
graphs that share some regularity properties that are related to distance in
the graph. For example, a known characterization of a distance-regular graph is
the invariance of the number of walks of given length between vertices at a
given distance, while a graph is called walk-regular if the number of closed
walks of given length rooted at any given vertex is a constant. One of the
concepts studied here is a generalization of both distance-regularity and
walk-regularity called $m$-walk-regularity. Another studied concept is that of
$m$-partial distance-regularity or, informally, distance-regularity up to
distance $m$. Using eigenvalues of graphs and the predistance polynomials, we
discuss and relate these and other concepts of almost distance-regularity, such
as their common generalization of $(\ell,m)$-walk-regularity. We introduce the
concepts of punctual distance-regularity and punctual walk-regularity as a
fundament upon which almost distance-regular graphs are built. We provide
examples that are mostly taken from the Foster census, a collection of
symmetric cubic graphs. Two problems are posed that are related to the question
of when almost distance-regular becomes whole distance-regular. We also give
several characterizations of punctually distance-regular graphs that are
generalizations of the spectral excess theorem.

the stronger result that a subgroup of $F_k$ is measure preserving if and only

(L5) Lagrange point, 2008 LC18, offers an opportunity to confirm the formation
mechanism of a member of this important tracer population for the Solar
system's dynamical history. We tested the stability of 2008 LC18's orbit
through a detailed dynamical study, using test particles spread across the
orbital uncertainties in a, e, i and {\Omega}. This showed that the wide
uncertainties of the published orbit span regions of both extreme dynamical
instability, with lifetimes < 100 Myr, and with significant stability (> 1 Gyr
lifetimes). The stability of 2008 LC18's clones is greatly dependent on their
semi-major axis and only weakly correlated with their eccentricity. Test
particles on orbits with an initial semi-major axis less than 29.91 AU have
dynamical half-lives shorter than 100 Myr; in contrast, particles with an
initial semi-major axis greater than 29.91 AU exhibit such strong dynamical
stability that almost all are retained over the 1 Gyr of our simulations. More
observations of this object are necessary to improve the orbit. If 2008 LC18 is
in the unstable region, then our simulations imply that it is either a
temporary Trojan capture, or a representative of a slowly decaying Trojan
population (like its sibling the L4 Neptunian Trojan 2001 QR322), and that it
may not be primordial. Alternatively, if the orbit falls into the larger,
stable region, then 2008 LC18 is a primordial member of the highly stable and
highly inclined component of the Neptune Trojan population, joining 2005 TN53
and 2007 VL305. We attempted to recover 2008 LC18 using the 2.3m telescope at

proximity and apparent isolation provide a unique opportunity to study galactic
evolution without any obvious strong external influences. This paper aims to
study the spatial distribution of the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) population
and metallicity in NGC 6822. Using deep, high quality JHK photometry, taken
with WFCAM on UKIRT, carbon- and oxygen-rich AGB stars have been isolated. The
ratio between their number, the C/M ratio, has then been used to derive the
[Fe/H] abundance across the galaxy. The tip of the red giant branch is located
at K0 = 17.41 \pm 0.11 mag and the colour separation between carbon- and
oxygen-rich AGB stars is at (J - K)0 = 1.20 \pm 0.03 mag (i.e. (J - K)2MAS S
{\guillemotright} 1.28 mag). A C/M ratio of 0.62 \pm 0.03 has been derived in
the inner 4 kpc of the galaxy, which translates into an iron abundance of
[Fe/H] = -1.29\pm0.07 dex. Variations of these parameters were investigated as
a function of distance from the galaxy centre and azimuthal angle. The AGB
population of NGC 6822 has been detected out to a radius of 4 kpc giving a
diameter of 56 arcmin. It is metal-poor, but there is no obvious gradient in
metallicity with either radial distance from the centre or azimuthal angle. The
detected spread in the TRGB magnitude is consistent with that of a galaxy
surrounded by a halo of old stars. The C/M ratio has the potential to be a very
useful tool for the determination of metallicity in resolved galaxies but a
better calibration of the C/M vs. [Fe/H] relation and a better understanding of
the sensitivities of the C/M ratio to stellar selection criteria is first
required.

systems by establishing a thorough control over cooling and trapping

approach to reach the long standing goal of harnessing collective quantum
phenomena with exciton gases. While long-lived excitons are simply cooled to
very low temperatures using cryogenic apparatus, engineering confining
potentials has been a challenging task. This degree of control was only
achieved recently with devices realized by highly demanding nano-fabrication
processes. Here, we demonstrate an alternative to this technology and show how
a proper optical excitation allows to manipulate in-situ the exciton transport.
Our approach is based on the optically controlled injection and spatial
patterning of charges trapped in a field-effect device. Thus, electric field
gradients are created and implement microscopic traps or anti-traps for the
excitons dipole. Accordingly, any confinement geometry can be realized by
shaping the spatial profile of a laser excitation. Hence, we succeed in
trapping exciton gases in a density range where quantum correlations are
predicted at our very low bath temperature.

meaningful biological activity. A major challenge that arises is that the
number of compounds to search over can be quite large, sometimes numbering in
the millions, making experimental testing intractable. For this reason
computational methods are employed to filter out those compounds which do not
exhibit strong biological activity. This filtering step, also called virtual
screening reduces the search space, allowing for the remaining compounds to be
experimentally tested. In this paper we propose several novel approaches to the
problem of virtual screening based on Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and

standard theories require an energy barrier over which the bound particle (or

the long-range repulsion responsible for the barrier is either absent or
screened (as in Cooper pairs, ionized plasma, or biomolecular complexes). We
solve this classical problem by accounting for entropic memory at the

by their stars. It depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF)
describing the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed.
Consequently knowledge of the IMF is critical to virtually every aspect of
galaxy evolution. More than half a century after the first IMF determination,
no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal in different galaxies.
Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy
centres cannot be both universal, but they could not break the degeneracy
between the two effects. Only recently indications were found that massive
elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as our Milky Way. Here we report
unambiguous evidence for a strong systematic variation of the IMF in early-type
galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratio, producing
differences up to a factor of three in mass. This was inferred from detailed
dynamical models of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large
Atlas3D representative sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders
of magnitude in stellar mass. Our finding indicates that the IMF depends
intimately on a galaxy's formation history.

processes, we shed new light on some common observational phenomena. Methods:
We discuss measurements of the solar Mt. Wilson S-index, obtained by the
Hamburg Robotic Telescope around the extreme minimum year 2009, and compare the
established chromospheric basal Ca II K line flux to the Mt. Wilson S-index
data of inactive (""flat activity"") stars, including giants. Results: During the
unusually deep and extended activity minimum of 2009, the Sun reached S-index
values considerably lower than in any of its previously observed minima. In
several brief periods, the Sun coincided exactly with the S-indices of inactive
(""flat"", presumed Maunder Minimum-type) solar analogues of the Mt. Wilson
sample; at the same time, the solar visible surface was also free of any plages
or remaining weak activity regions. The corresponding minimum Ca II K flux of
the quiet Sun and of the presumed Maunder Minimum-type stars in the Mt. Wilson
sample are found to be identical to the corresponding Ca II K chromospheric
basal flux limit. Conclusions: We conclude that the quiet-Sun chromosphere is a
universal phenomenon among inactive stars. Its mixed-polarity magnetic field,
generated by a local, ""fast"" turbulent dynamo finally provides a natural
explanation for the minimal soft X-ray emission observed for inactive stars.
Given such a local dynamo also works for giant chromospheres, albeit on larger
length scales, i.e., l ~ R/g, with R and g as stellar radius and surface
gravity, respectively, the existence of giant spicular phenomena and the
guidance of mechanical energy toward the acceleration zone of cool stellar
winds along flux-tubes have now become traceable.

not generate a final state for sure, it considers arbitrary mixed initial
states instead of pure states and n-party protocols for an arbitrary n. In this
very general setting, local operations and classical communication can never
decrease the expected spectra of the local mixed states in the majorization
ordering. In other terms, the local states can only become purer (weakly) in
expectation. The proof also provides an improvement on Nielsen's. The if part
of Nielsen's characterization does not generalize. This is shown by studying
the entanglement of three qubits. It is shown that one can find pure states of
a system of three qubits that are not equivalent under unitary local operations

asymmetric beam splitter introduces additional a priori which-path knowledge,
which is different for a particle detected at one output port of the
interferometer and a particle detected at the other. Accordingly, the fringe
visibilities of the interference patterns emerging at the two output ports are
also different. Hence, in sharp contrast with the symmetric case, here we
should concentrate on one output port and distinguish two possible paths taken
by the particles detected at that port among four paths. It turns out that two
nonorthogonal unsharp observables are measured jointly in this setup. We apply
the condition for joint measurability of these unsharp observables to obtain a

two-component modes of three generic types, as concerns the spatial symmetry of
each component: symmetric-symmetric (Sm-Sm), antisymmetric-antisymmetric
(AS-AS), and symmetric-antisymmetric (S-AS) ones. In the limit case of the
nonlinear potential represented by two $% \delta $-functions, solutions are
obtained in a semi-analytical form. They feature novel properties, in
comparison with the previously studied single-component model. In particular,
the SSB of antisymmetric modes is possible solely in the two-component system,
and, obviously, S-AS states exist only in the two-component system too. In the
general case of the symmetric pair of finite-width nonlinear potential wells,
evolution scenarios are very complex. In this case, new results are reported,
first, for the single-component model. These are pairs of broken-antisymmetry
modes, and of twin-peak symmetric ones, which are generated by saddle-mode
bifurcations separated from the transformations previously studied in the the
single-component setting. With regard to these findings, complex scenarios of
the evolution of the two-component solution families are realized in terms of
links connecting pairs of modes of three simplest types: (A) two-component ones
with unbroken symmetries; (B) single-component modes featuring density peaks in
both potential wells; (C) single-component modes which are trapped,
essentially, in a single well.

the effect of measurements on the majorization relation among states. It, then,

majorizes the initial spectrum, i.e., a P.O.V.M. measurement cannot, in
expectation, reduce the information of the observer. A new proof of this result
is presented and, as a consequence, the only if part of Nielsen's

scattering and absorption on the degree of Ohmic dissipation in hot Jovian
atmospheres. With the assumption of Saha equilibrium, the variation in
temperature is the main driver of the variations in the electrical
conductivity, induced current and Ohmic power dissipated. Atmospheres
possessing temperature inversions tend to dissipate most of the Ohmic power
superficially, at high altitudes, whereas those without temperature inversions
are capable of greater dissipation deeper down. Scattering in the optical range
of wavelengths tends to cool the lower atmosphere, thus reducing the degree of
dissipation at depth. Purely absorbing cloud decks (in the infrared), of a
finite extent in height, allow for localized reductions in dissipation and may
reverse a temperature inversion if they are dense and thick enough, thus
greatly enhancing the dissipation at depth. If Ohmic dissipation is the
mechanism for inflating hot Jupiters, then variations in the atmospheric
opacity (which may be interpreted as arising from variations in metallicity and
cloud/haze properties) and magnetic field strength naturally produce a scatter
in the measured radii at a given strength of irradiation. Future work will
determine if these effects are dominant over evolutionary effects, which also
contribute a scatter to the measured radii.

probabilities is intractable. Recent research has seen the proposal of several
new estimators designed specifically to overcome this intractability, but
virtually nothing is known about their theoretical properties. In this paper,
we present a generalized estimator that unifies many of the classical and
recently proposed estimators. We use results from the standard asymptotic
theory for M-estimators to derive a generic expression for the asymptotic

the relative statistical efficiency of classical pseudolikelihood and the

Divergence-based learning may not be suitable for training CRBMs. We then
identify two distinct types of structured output prediction problems and
propose an improved learning algorithm for each. The first problem type is one
where the output space has arbitrary structure but the set of likely output
configurations is relatively small, such as in multi-label classification. The
second problem is one where the output space is arbitrarily structured but
where the output space variability is much greater, such as in image denoising

this fact, we propose a general mechanism which decides on an allocation rule

slowly and smoothly shifted across documents (providing that the documents are

among the stories of consecutive days can be modeled by using windows over

we prove a generalization of the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem under all

unions of unknown subspaces). From these results we obtain new theoretical
insights and promising experimental results.

This paper introduces the k-test to measure the approximation hardness of
inference on Bayesian networks with deterministic causalities in the
probability distribution, i.e. when zero conditional probabilities are
permitted. Approximation by stochastic sampling is a widely-used inference
method that is known to suffer from inefficiencies due to sample rejection. The
k-test predicts when rejection rates of stochastic sampling a Bayesian network
will be low, modest, high, or when sampling is intractable.

The proposed method is computationally efficient and easy to implement.
Experimental results show that it outperforms other methods, especially when

solved using cutting plane methods such as SVM-Perf and BMRM. One can show that
these algorithms converge to an eta accurate solution in O(1/Lambda*e)
iterations, where lambda is the trade-off parameter between the regularizer and
the loss function. We present a smoothing strategy for multivariate performance
scores, in particular precision/recall break-even point and ROCArea. When
combined with Nesterov's accelerated gradient algorithm our smoothing strategy
yields an optimization algorithm which converges to an eta accurate solution in
O(min{1/e,1/sqrt(lambda*e)}) iterations. Furthermore, the cost per iteration of
our scheme is the same as that of SVM-Perf and BMRM. Empirical evaluation on a
number of publicly available datasets shows that our method converges
significantly faster than cutting plane methods without sacrificing

propagation over them is among the most prominent approaches to computing
posteriors in BNs. However, belief propagation over junction tree is known to
be computationally intensive in the general case. Its complexity may increase
dramatically with the connectivity and state space cardinality of Bayesian
network nodes. In this paper, we address this computational challenge using GPU
parallelization. We develop data structures and algorithms that extend existing
junction tree techniques, and specifically develop a novel approach to
computing each belief propagation message in parallel. We implement our
approach on an NVIDIA GPU and test it using BNs from several applications.
Experimentally, we study how junction tree parameters affect parallelization
opportunities and hence the performance of our algorithm. We achieve speedups
ranging from 0.68 to 9.18 for the BNs studied.

high-dimensional variables X and Y are due to a causal influence from X to Y or
from Y to X. The earlier proposed so-called Trace Method is extended to the
regime where the dimension of the observed variables exceeds the sample size.
Based on previous work, we postulate conditions that characterize a causal
relation between X and Y. Moreover, we describe a statistical test and argue
that both causal directions are typically rejected if there is a common cause.
A full theoretical analysis is presented for the deterministic case but our
approach seems to be valid for the noisy case, too, for which we additionally
present an approach based on a sparsity constraint. The discussed method yields
promising results for both simulated and real world data.

simultaneous reality. In contrast, quantum theory claims that the wave function
can capture the physical reality completely, and the physical quantities
associated to two non-commuting operators cannot have simultaneous reality. The
above contradiction is known as the EPR paradox. Here, we unambiguously expose
that there is a hidden assumption made by EPR, which gives rise to this famous
paradox. Putting the assumption right this time leads us not to the paradox,
but only reinforces the correctness of the quantum theory. However, it is shown
here that the entanglement phenomenon between two physically separated
