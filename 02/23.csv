Frequency (SRF) cavities, Magnesium Diboride (MgB2) opens up hope because of
its high transition temperature and potential for low surface resistance in the
high RF field regime. However, due to the presence of the small superconducting
gap in the {\pi} band, the nonlinear response of MgB2 is potentially quite
large compared to a single gap s-wave superconductor (SC) such as Nb.
Understanding the mechanisms of nonlinearity coming from the two-band structure
of MgB2, as well as extrinsic sources, is an urgent requirement. A localized
and strong RF magnetic field, created by a magnetic write head, is integrated
into our nonlinear-Meissner-effect scanning microwave microscope [1]. MgB2
films with thickness 50 nm, fabricated by a hybrid physical-chemical vapor
deposition technique on dielectric substrates, are measured at a fixed location
and show a strongly temperature-dependent third harmonic response. We propose
that at least two mechanisms are responsible for this nonlinear response, one
of which involves vortex nucleation and penetration into the film. [1] T. M.

particle filters lose accuracy dramatically when presented with an unlikely
observation. Such an observation may be caused by an unusually large
measurement error or reflect a rare fluctuation in the dynamics of the system.
Over a long enough span of time it becomes likely that one or several of these
events will occur. Often they are signatures of the most interesting features
of the underlying system and their prediction becomes the primary focus of the
data assimilation procedure. The Kuroshio or Black Current that runs along the
eastern coast of Japan is an example of such a system. It undergoes infrequent
but dramatic changes of state between a small meander during which the current
remains close to the coast of Japan, and a large meander during which it bulges
away from the coast. Because of the important role that the Kuroshio plays in
distributing heat and salinity in the surrounding region, prediction of these
transitions is of acute interest. Here we focus on a regime in which both the
stochastic forcing on the system and the observational noise are small. In this
setting large deviation theory can be used to understand why standard filtering
methods fail and guide the design of the more effective data assimilation
techniques. Motivated by our analysis we propose several data assimilation
strategies capable of efficiently handling rare events such as the transitions
of the Kuroshio. These techniques are tested on a model of the Kuroshio and
shown to perform much better than standard filtering methods.

focus on electronic correlations, spin and geometrical effects using a
combination of atomistic tight-binding, Hartree-Fock and configuration
interaction methods (TB+HF+CI) including long range Coulomb interactions. The
single particle energy spectrum of triangular dots with zigzag edges exhibits a
degenerate shell at the Fermi level with a degeneracy N_{edge} proportional to
the edge size. We determine the effect of the electron-electron interactions on
the ground state, the total spin and the excitation spectrum as a function of a
shell filling and the degeneracy of the shell using TB+HF+CI for N_{edge} < 12
and approximate CI method for N_{edge}\geq 12. For a half-filled neutral shell
we find spin polarized ground state for structures up to N=500 atoms in
agreement with previous {\it ab initio} and mean-field calculations, and in
agreement with Lieb's theorem for a Hubbard model on a bipartite lattice.
Adding a single electron leads to the complete spin depolarization for
N_{edge}\leq 9. For larger structures, the spin depolarization is shown to
occur at different filling factors. Away from half-fillings excess
electrons(holes) are shown to form Wigner-like spin polarized triangular
molecules corresponding to large gaps in the excitation spectrum. The validity
of conclusions is assessed by a comparison of results obtained from different

qualitatively similar results, away from the charge neutrality an inclusion of

Phase I cancer clinical trials. We examine the small-sample behavior of these
""Bayesian Phase I"" (BP1) designs, and also of non-Bayesian designs sharing the
same main ""long-memory"" traits (hereafter: LMP1s).
  For all LMP1s examined, the number of cohorts treated at the true MTD
(denoted here as n*) was highly variable between numerical runs drawn from the
same toxicity-threshold distribution, especially when compared with
""up-and-down"" (U&D) short-memory designs. Further investigation using the same
set of thresholds in permuted order, produced a nearly-identical magnitude of
variability in n*. Therefore, this LMP1 behavior is driven by a strong
sensitivity to the order in which toxicity thresholds appear in the experiment.
We suggest that the sensitivity is related to LMP1's tendency to ""settle"" early
on a specific dose level - a tendency caused by the repeated likelihood-based
""winner-takes-all"" dose assignment rule, which grants the early cohorts a
disproportionately large influence upon experimental trajectories.
  Presently, U&D designs offer a simpler and more stable alternative, with
roughly equivalent MTD estimation performance. A promising direction for
combining the two approaches is briefly discussed (note: the '3+3' protocol is

velocity is a finite-energy and L^q-summable perturbation of the Oseen vortex
with circulation \alpha, where 1 < q < 2. If {\alpha} is sufficiently small, we
show that the solution behaves asymptotically in time like the self-similar
Oseen vortex with circulation \alpha. This is a global stability result, which
holds for arbitrarily large perturbations of the Oseen vortex, and our
smallness assumption on the circulation is independent of the domain under
consideration.

to $\mathop {\mathbb{E}}_{X\leftarrow\mathcal{N}^d}[\sup_{v\in V}|\langle
v,X\rangle|]$ deterministically in time $\operatorname

deterministic polynomial time approximation algorithm was known due to the work
of Ding, Lee and Peres [Ann. of Math. (2) 175 (2012) 1409-1471]. This answers
an open question of Lee (2010) and Ding [Ann. Probab. 42 (2014) 464-496]. The
study of supremum of Gaussian processes is of considerable importance in
probability with applications in functional analysis, convex geometry, and in
light of the recent breakthrough work of Ding, Lee and Peres [Ann. of Math. (2)
175 (2012) 1409-1471], to random walks on finite graphs. As such our result
could be of use elsewhere. In particular, combining with the work of Ding [Ann.
Probab. 42 (2014) 464-496], our result yields a PTAS for computing the cover
time of bounded-degree graphs. Previously, such algorithms were known only for
trees. Along the way, we also give an explicit oblivious estimator for
semi-norms in Gaussian space with optimal query complexity. Our algorithm and
its analysis are elementary in nature, using two classical comparison
inequalities, Slepian's lemma and Kanter's lemma.

on a discrete, Lagrangian formulation of the smooth equations. The model makes
use of a condensed set of coordinates, called the centerline/spin
representation: the kinematical constraints linking the centerline's tangent to
the orientation of the material frame is used to eliminate two out of three
degrees of freedom associated with rotations. Based on a description of twist
inspired from discrete differential geometry and from variational principles,
we build a full-fledged discrete viscous thread model, which includes in
particular a discrete representation of the internal viscous stress.
Consistency of the discrete model with the classical, smooth equations is
established formally in the limit of a vanishing discretization length. The
discrete models lends itself naturally to numerical implementation. Our
numerical method is validated against reference solutions for steady coiling.
The method makes it possible to simulate the unsteady behavior of thin viscous
jets in a robust and efficient way, including the combined effects of inertia,
stretching, bending, twisting, large rotations and surface tension.

set f(A) = {f(a,b,c):a,b,c \in A} has cardinality at least C|A|^2/log|A|, for
an absolute constant C. Previously-known functions with this property had all
been of four variables.
  We also improve on the state of the art for functions of four variables by
constructing a function g for which g(A) has cardinality at least C|A|^2; the
previously best-achieved bound was C|A|^2/log|A|.
  Finally, we give an example of a five-variable function h for which h(A) has
cardinality at least C|A|^4/log|A|.
  Proving these results depends only on the Szemeredi-Trotter incidence theorem
and an analoguous result for planes due to Edelsbrunner, Guibas and Sharir,
each applied in the Erlangen-type framework of Elekes and Sharir. In particular
the proofs do not employ the Guth-Katz polynomial partitioning technique or the
theory of ruled surfaces.
  Although the growth exponents for f, g and h are stronger than those for
previously considered functions, it is not clear that they are necessarily
sharp. So we pose a question as to whether the bounds on the cardinalities of
f(A), g(A) and h(A) can be further strengthened.

networks that has both a given degree distribution and a tunable clustering
coefficient. We consider two types of growth processes on these graphs:
diffusion and symmetric threshold model. The diffusion process is inspired from
epidemic models. It is characterized by an infection probability, each neighbor
transmitting the epidemic independently. In the symmetric threshold process,
the interactions are still local but the propagation rule is governed by a
threshold (that might vary among the different nodes). An interesting example
of symmetric threshold process is the contagion process, which is inspired by a
simple coordination game played on the network. Both types of processes have
been used to model spread of new ideas, technologies, viruses or worms and
results have been obtained for random graphs with no clustering. In this paper,
we are able to analyze the impact of clustering on the growth processes. While
clustering inhibits the diffusion process, its impact for the contagion process
is more subtle and depends on the connectivity of the graph: in a low
connectivity regime, clustering also inhibits the contagion, while in a high
connectivity regime, clustering favors the appearance of global cascades but
reduces their size.
  For both diffusion and symmetric threshold models, we characterize conditions
under which global cascades are possible and compute their size explicitly, as
a function of the degree distribution and the clustering coefficient. Our
results are applied to regular or power-law graphs with exponential cutoff and
shed new light on the impact of clustering.

particular, we determine the critical length scale associated with the onset of
two types of instabilities -vortices and clusters- via stability analyses of
the Navier-Stokes-order hydrodynamic equations by using the expressions of the
transport coefficients obtained from both the standard and the modified-Sonine
approximations. We examine the impact of both Sonine approximations over a
range of solids fraction \phi <0.2 for small restitution coefficients
e=0.25--0.4, where the standard and modified theories exhibit discrepancies.
The theoretical predictions for the critical length scales are compared to
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, of which a small percentage were not
considered due to inelastic collapse. Results show excellent quantitative
agreement between MD and the modified-Sonine theory, while the standard theory
loses accuracy for this highly dissipative parameter space. The modified theory
also remedies a (highdissipation) qualitative mismatch between the standard
theory and MD for the instability that forms more readily. Furthermore, the
evolution of cluster size is briefly examined via MD, indicating that
domain-size clusters may remain stable or halve in size, depending on system
parameters.

is studied beyond the mean-field approximation. Suppression of the screening at
large distances, caused by appearance of the gap, is considered
self-consistently. A mutual positive feedback between appearance of the gap and
enlargement of the interaction leads to a sharp transition to correlated state
with greatly increased gap above some critical value of the coupling strength.
At coupling strength below the critical, this correlation effect increases the
gap approximately by a factor of two. The maximal coupling strength achievable
in experiments is close to the critical value. This indicated importance of
correlation effects in closely-spaced graphene bilayers at weak substrate
dielectric screening. Another effect beyond mean-field approximation considered
is an influence of vertex corrections on the pairing, which is shown to be very
weak.

central to modern information and communication technologies, as well as
quantum information processing schemes. However, as photons do not possess
charge, controlling them efficiently by electrical means has so far proved
elusive. A promising way to achieve electric control of light could be through
plasmon polaritons - coupled excitations of photons and charge carriers - in
graphene. In this two-dimensional sheet of carbon atoms, it is expected that
plasmon polaritons and their associated optical fields can be readily tuned
electrically by varying the graphene carrier density. While optical graphene
plasmon resonances have recently been investigated spectroscopically, no
experiments so far have directly resolved propagating plasmons in real space.
Here, we launch and detect propagating optical plasmons in tapered graphene
nanostructures using near-field scattering microscopy with infrared excitation
light. We provide real-space images of plasmonic field profiles and find that
the extracted plasmon wavelength is remarkably short - over 40 times smaller
than the wavelength of illumination. We exploit this strong optical field
confinement to turn a graphene nanostructure into a tunable resonant plasmonic
cavity with extremely small mode volume. The cavity resonance is controlled
in-situ by gating the graphene, and in particular, complete switching on and
off of the plasmon modes is demonstrated, thus paving the way towards
graphene-based optical transistors. This successful alliance between
nanoelectronics and nano-optics enables the development of unprecedented active
subwavelength-scale optics and a plethora of novel nano-optoelectronic devices

processing and strongly enhanced light-matter interactions for quantum devices

crowdsourcing environments with strategic agents, when entry is an endogenous,
strategic choice. Modeling endogenous entry in crowdsourcing is important
because there is a nonzero cost to making a contribution of any quality which
can be avoided by not participating, and indeed many sites based on
crowdsourced content do not have adequate participation. We use a mechanism
with monotone, rank-based, rewards in a model where agents strategically make
participation and quality choices to capture a wide variety of crowdsourcing
environments, ranging from conventional crowdsourcing contests to crowdsourced
content as in online Q&A forums.
  We first explicitly construct the unique mixed-strategy equilibrium for such
monotone rank-order mechanisms, and use these participation probabilities and
quality distribution to address the design of incentives for two kinds of
rewards that arise in crowdsourcing. We first show that for attention rewards
as in crowdsourced content, the entire equilibrium distribution improves when
the rewards for every rank but the last are as high as possible. In particular,
when producing the lowest quality content has low cost, the optimal mechanism
displays all but the worst contribution. We next investigate settings where
there is a total reward that can be arbitrarily distributed amongst all
participants, as in crowdsourcing contests. Unlike with exogenous entry, here
the expected number of participants can be increased by subsidizing entry,
which could potentially improve the expected quality of the best contribution.
However, we show that free entry is dominated by taxing entry- making all
entrants pay a small fee, which is rebated to the winner along with whatever
rewards were already assigned, can improve the quality of the best contribution
over a winner-take-all contest with no taxes.

involves the construction of a certain Chern character tailored to work with

Astronomy Observatory CO J=1-0 data to produce the first map of molecular-gas
temperatures across a GMC and the most accurate determination of the mass
distribution in W3 yet obtained. We measure excitation temperatures in the part
of the cloud dominated by triggered star formation (the High Density Layer,
HDL) of 15-30 K, while in the rest of the cloud, which is relatively unaffected
by triggering (Low Density Layer, LDL), the excitation temperature is generally
less than 12 K. We identify a temperature gradient in the HDL which we
associate with an age sequence in the embedded massive star-forming regions. We
measure the mass of the cloud to be 4.4+/-0.4 x 10^5 solar masses, in agreement
with previous estimates. Existing sub-mm continuum data are used to derive the
fraction of gas mass in dense clumps as a function of position in the cloud.
This fraction, which we interpret as a Clump Formation Efficiency (CFE), is
significantly enhanced across the HDL, probably due to the triggering. Finally,
we measure the 3D rms Mach Number as a function of position and find a
correlation between the Mach number and the CFE within the HDL only. This
correlation is interpreted as due to feedback from the newly-formed stars and a
change in its slope between the three main star-forming regions is construed as
another evolutionary effect. We conclude that triggering has affected the
star-formation process in the W3 GMC primarily by creating additional dense
structures that can collapse into stars. Any traces of changes in CFE due to
additional turbulence have since been overruled by the feedback effects of the
star-forming process itself.

attaching a new tile, or breaking apart an assembly to happen in any order.
Within this highly generalized model we provide three new solutions to tile
self-assembly problems that have been addressed within the abstract Tile
Assembly Model and its variants, showing that signal passing tiles allow for
substantial improvement across multiple complexity metrics. Our first result
utilizes a recursive assembly process to achieve tile-type efficient assembly
of linear structures, using provably fewer tile types than what is possible in
standard tile assembly models. Our second system of signal-passing tiles
simulates any Turing machine with high fuel efficiency by using only a constant
number of tiles per computation step. Our third system assembles the discrete
Sierpinski triangle, demonstrating that this pattern can be strictly
self-assembled within the STAM. This result is of particular interest in that
it is known that this pattern cannot self-assemble within a number of well
studied tile self-assembly models. Notably, all of our constructions are at
temperature 1, further demonstrating that signal-passing confers the power to
bypass many restrictions found in standard tile assembly models.

independent backward messages. As a consequence, we show that feedback can
provide a net increase in capacity even if feedback cost is taken into

to study and describe some of the physical characteristics of neutron star,
especially the mass-radius relation and chemical compositions. To study the
influence of a the magnetic field and the hyperons in the stellar interior, we
consider altogether four solutions: two different values of magnetic field to
obtain a weak and a strong influence, and two configurations: a family of
neutron stars formed only by protons, electrons and neutrons and a family
formed by protons, electrons, neutrons, muons and hyperons. The limit and the
validity of the results found are discussed with some care. In all cases the
particles that constitute the neutron star are in $\beta$ equilibrium and zero
total net charge. Our work indicates that the effect of a strong magnetic field
has to be taken into account in the description of magnetars, mainly if we
believe that there are hyperons in their interior, in which case, the influence
of the magnetic field can increase the mass by more than 10%. We have also seen
that although a magnetar can reach 2.48$M_{\odot}$, a natural explanation of
why we do not know pulsars with masses above 2.0$M_{\odot}$ arises. We also

For unilateral link formation we show a bound of O(1) on the price of anarchy

Eddington luminosity. This can drive vigorous convective motions which in turn
excite internal gravity waves. The local wave energy flux excited by convection
is itself well above Eddington during the last few years in the life of the
star. We suggest that an interesting fraction of the energy in gravity waves
can, in some cases, convert into sound waves as the gravity waves propagate
(tunnel) towards the stellar surface. The subsequent dissipation of the sound

wave-driven mass loss can explain the existence of extremely large stellar mass
loss rates just prior to core-collapse, which are inferred via circumstellar

and even Type IIn supernovae more generally). An outstanding question is
understanding what stellar parameters (mass, rotation, metallicity, age) are

internal structure of massive stars and the power-spectrum of internal gravity
waves excited by stellar convection.

characterized by an isotropic, homogeneous, and Gaussian random distribution
about a locally flat background. Even in a flat universe, the spatial curvature
measured within one Hubble volume receives contributions from long wavelength
perturbations, and will not in general be zero. These same perturbations
determine the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature fluctuations, which
are O(10^-5). Consequently, the low-l multipole moments in the CMB temperature
map predict the value of the measured spatial curvature \Omega_k. On this basis
we argue that a measurement of |\Omega_k| > 10^-4 would rule out slow-roll
eternal inflation in our past with high confidence, while a measurement of
\Omega_k < -10^-4 (which is positive curvature, a locally closed universe)
rules out false-vacuum eternal inflation as well, at the same confidence level.
In other words, negative curvature (a locally open universe) is consistent with
false-vacuum eternal inflation but not with slow-roll eternal inflation, and
positive curvature falsifies both. Near-future experiments will dramatically
extend the sensitivity of \Omega_k measurements and constitute a sharp test of
these predictions.

alignment models with a moderate mediation scale are consistent with the data,

in two dimensions. Dirac hamiltonians on the one dimensional edge are
classified according to the discrete symmetries of time-reversal,
particle-hole, and chirality, extending a previous classification in two
dimensions. We find 17 inequivalent classes, of which 11 have protected zero
modes. Although bulk topological invariants are thus far known for only 5 of
these classes, we conjecture that the additional 6 describe edge states of new
classes of topological insulators. The effects of interactions in two
dimensions are also studied. We show that all interactions that preserve the
symmetries are exactly marginal, i.e. preserve the gaplessness. This leads to a
description of the distinct variations of Luttinger liquids that can be
realized on the edge.

platforms is deeply linked to the history of the universe. Since life as we
know it relies on chemical elements forged in dying heavy stars, the universe
needs to be old enough for stars to form and evolve. Current cosmological
theory indicates that the universe is 13.7$\pm 0.13$ billion years old and that
the first stars formed hundreds of millions of years after the big bang. At
least some stars formed with stable planetary systems wherein a set of
biochemical reactions leading to life could have taken place. In this lecture,
I argue that we can divide cosmological history into four ages, from the big
bang to intelligent life. The Physical Age describes the origin of the
universe, of matter, of cosmic nucleosynthesis, as well as the formation of the
first stars and galaxies. The Chemical Age begun when heavy stars provided the
raw ingredients for life through stellar nucleosynthesis and describes how
heavier chemical elements collected in nascent planets and moons to give rise
to prebiotic biomolecules. The Biological Age describes the origin of early
life, its evolution through Darwinian natural selection, and the emergence of
complex multicellular life forms. Finally, the Cognitive Age describes how
complex life evolved into intelligent life capable of self-awareness and of
developing technology through the directed manipulation of energy and
materials. We conclude discussing whether we are the rule or the exception.

within a stable environment adjust to radiative heating by ascending gradually
across isentropes while spreading sufficiently fast so as to keep isentropic
surfaces nearly flat. More optically dense clouds experience very concentrated
heating, and if they are also very broad, they develop a convecting mixed
layer. Along isentropic spreading still occurs, but in the form of turbulent
density currents rather than laminar flows. A third adjustment mode relates to
evaporation, which erodes cloudy air as it lofts. The dominant mode is
determined from two dimensionless numbers, whose predictive power is shown in
comparisons with high resolution numerical cloud simulations. The power and
simplicity of the approach hints that fast, sub-grid scale radiative-dynamic

interaction coupling constant determined by the parameter beta > 0. When beta =
1,2 and 4, this model can be regarded as a stochastic realization of the
eigenvalue statistics of Gaussian random matrices. The second system comes from
Dunkl processes, which are defined using differential-difference operators
(Dunkl operators) associated with finite abstract vector sets called root
systems. When the type-A root system is specified, Dunkl processes constitute a
one-parameter system similar to Dyson's model, with the difference that its
particles interchange positions spontaneously. We prove that the type-A Dunkl
processes with parameter k > 0 starting from any symmetric initial
configuration are equivalent to Dyson's model with the parameter beta = 2k. We
focus on the intertwining operators, since they play a central role in the
mathematical theory of Dunkl operators, but their general closed form is not
yet known. Using the equivalence between symmetric Dunkl processes and Dyson's
model, we extract the effect of the intertwining operator of type A on
symmetric polynomials from these processes' transition probability densities.
In the strong coupling limit, the intertwining operator maps all symmetric
polynomials onto a function of the sum of their variables. In this limit,
Dyson's model freezes, and it becomes a deterministic process with a final
configuration proportional to the roots of the Hermite polynomials multiplied
by the square root of the process time, while being independent of the initial
configuration.

of Landauer channels in a system with discrete energy spectrum and the
eigenfunctions that cannot be described as plane waves. In order to determine

numerically solved the time-dependent Schr\""{o}dinger equation describing a

stochastic 'ripples'. The ripples serve as a localized energy source and are
offset to one side of the potential well. As the result a non-zero net energy
flux flows from one part of the potential well to another across the symmetry
center of the potential. We find that some modes exhibit positive correlation
with the direction of the energy flow. Other modes, that carry a smaller energy
per unit of the probability flux, anticorrelate with the energy flow and thus
provide a backflow of the probability. The overall picture of energy transport

determine the limits of applicability of Monin-Obukhov similarity theory (in
the local scaling formulation) in the stable atmospheric boundary layer. Based
on the spectral analysis of wind velocity and air temperature fluctuations, it
is shown that, when both of the gradient Richardson number, Ri, and the flux
Richardson number, Rf, exceed a 'critical value' of about 0.20 - 0.25, the
inertial subrange associated with the Richardson-Kolmogorov cascade dies out
and vertical turbulent fluxes become small. Some small-scale turbulence
survives even in this supercritical regime, but this is non-Kolmogorov
turbulence, and it decays rapidly with further increasing stability. Similarity
theory is based on the turbulent fluxes in the high-frequency part of the
spectra that are associated with energy-containing/flux-carrying eddies.
Spectral densities in this high-frequency band diminish as the
Richardson-Kolmogorov energy cascade weakens; therefore, the applicability of
local Monin-Obukhov similarity theory in stable conditions is limited by the
inequalities Ri < Ri_cr and Rf < Rf_cr. However, it is found that Rf_cr = 0.20
- 0.25 is a primary threshold for applicability. Applying this prerequisite
shows that the data follow classical Monin-Obukhov local z-less predictions
after the irrelevant cases (turbulence without the Richardson-Kolmogorov
cascade) have been filtered out.

main sequence. Models of magnetic braking can also explain the evolution of
close binary systems, including cataclysmic variables. The well-known period
gap in the orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variable systems
indicates that magnetic braking must be significantly disrupted in secondaries
that are fully convective. However, activity studies show that fully convective
stars are some of the most active stars observed in young open clusters. There
is therefore conflicting evidence about what happens to magnetic activity in
fully convective stars.
  Results from spectro-polarimetric studies of cool stars have found that the
field morphologies and field strengths are dependent on spectral type and
rotation rate. While rapidly rotating stars with radiative cores show strong,
complex magnetic fields, they have relatively weak dipole components. Fully
convective stars that are rapidly rotating also possess strong magnetic fields,
but their configurations are much simpler; often close to dipole fields. How
this change in field geometry affects the stellar wind is the focus of several
ongoing modelling efforts. Initial results suggest that rapidly rotating active
dwarfs drive much stronger winds, about two orders of magnitude larger than
those on the Sun.

antiferromagnetic exchange interaction. Recent studies using resonant inelastic
X-ray scattering strongly support these ideas [2]. Here as a further test we
vary J (as measured by two-magnon Raman scattering) by more than 60% by
changing ion sizes in the model HTS system LnA2Cu3O7-{\delta} where A=(Ba,Sr)

algebraic categories, and show that the category of coherent schemes can be
characterized by a universal property, if we fix the class of Grothendieck
topology. Also, we introduce the notion of $\scr{C}$-schemes, which is a
further generalization of coherent schemes and still shares common properties
with ordinary schemes.

crossover of a three-component ultracold superfluid-Fermi-gas of different
chemical-potentials and equal masses in two dimensions. The gap order parameter
and number densities are found analytically by using the functional
path-integral method. The balance of paring will be broken in the free space
due to the unequal chemical-potentials. We obtain the same particle
number-density and condensed fraction in the BCS superfluid phase as that in a
recent paper (Phys. Rev. A 83, 033630), while the Sarma phase of coexistence of
normal and superfluid Fermi gases is the characteristics of inhomogeneous
system. The minimum ratio of BCS superfluid phase becomes 1/3 in the BCS limit
corresponding to the zero-ratio in the two-component system in which the
critical point of phase separation is {\epsilon}B/{\epsilon}F = 2 but becomes 3
in the three-component case.

Hence, this decay process should be sensitive to the quark components of the
final-state light mesons, and would provide a great opportunity for testing the

selection of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens systems with known
redshifts. Statistically significant samples of strong lenses provide a
powerful method for measuring the mass-density parameters of the lensing
population, but results can only be generalized to the parent population if the
lensing selection biases are sufficiently understood. We perform controlled
Monte Carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys in order to quantify the
bias of lenses relative to parent galaxies in velocity dispersion, mass axis
ratio, and mass density profile. For parameters typical of the SLACS and BELLS
surveys, we find: (1) no significant mass axis ratio detection bias of lenses
relative to parent galaxies; (2) a very small detection bias toward shallow
mass density profiles, which is likely negligible compared to other sources of
uncertainty in this parameter; (3) a detection bias towards smaller Einstein
radius for systems drawn from parent populations with group- and cluster-scale
lensing masses; and (4) a lens-modeling bias towards larger velocity
dispersions for systems drawn from parent samples with sub-arcsecond mean
Einstein radii. This last finding indicates that the incorporation of
velocity-dispersion upper limits of \textit{non-lenses} is an important
ingredient for unbiased analyses of spectroscopically selected lens samples. In
general we find that the completeness of spectroscopic lens surveys in the
plane of Einstein radius and mass-density profile power-law index is quite
uniform, up to a sharp drop in the region of large Einstein radius and steep
mass density profile, and hence that such surveys are ideally suited to the
study of massive field galaxies.

to be a dynamical quantity. In quantum field theory in curved space-time
\rho_{\Lambda} should exhibit a slow evolution, determined by the expansion
rate of the universe H. Recent measurements on the time variation of the fine
structure constant and of the proton-electron mass ratio suggest that basic
quantities of the Standard Model, such as the QCD scale parameter
\Lambda_{QCD}, may not be conserved in the course of the cosmological
evolution. The masses of the nucleons m_N and of the atomic nuclei would also
be affected. Matter is not conserved in such a universe. These measurements can
be interpreted as a leakage of matter into vacuum or vice versa. We point out
that the amount of leakage necessary to explain the measured value of
\dot{m}_N/m_N could be of the same order of magnitude as the observationally
allowed value of \dot{\rho}_{\Lambda}/\rho_{\Lambda}, with a possible
contribution from the dark matter particles. The dark energy in our universe

Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) experiment. In this setting, a player's
strategies are not unitary transformations as in alternate quantum
game-theoretic frameworks, but a classical choice between two directions along
which spin or polarization measurements are made. The players' strategies thus
remain identical to their strategies in the mixed-strategy version of the
classical game. In the EPR setting the quantum game reduces itself to the
corresponding classical game when the shared quantum state reaches zero
entanglement. We find the relations for the probability distribution for
$N$-qubit GHZ and W-type states, subject to general measurement directions,
from which the expressions for the mixed Nash equilibrium and the payoffs are
determined. Players' payoffs are then defined with linear functions so that
common two-player games can be easily extended to the $N$-player case and
permit analytic expressions for the Nash equilibrium. As a specific example, we
solve the Prisoners' Dilemma game for general $ N \ge 2 $. We find a new
property for the game that for an even number of players the payoffs at the
Nash equilibrium are equal, whereas for an odd number of players the
cooperating players receive higher payoffs.

investigation of the properties of strongly compressed hadronic matter. Whereas
in heavy-ion collisions the fireball, created in the collision zone, contains
very hot matter, with varying density depending on the beam energy, neutron
stars largely sample the region of cold and dense matter with the exception of
the very short time period of the existence of the proto-neutron star.
Therefore, neutron star physics, in addition to its general importance in
astrophysics, is a crucial complement to heavy-ion physics in the study of
strongly interacting matter. In the following, model approaches will be
introduced to calculate properties of neutron stars that incorporate baryons
and quarks. These approaches are also able to describe the state of matter over
a wide range of temperatures and densities, which is essential if one wants to
connect and correlate star observables and results from heavy-ion collisions.
The effect of exotic particles and quark cores on neutron star properties will
be considered. In addition to the gross properties of the stars like their
masses and radii their expected inner composition is quite sensitive to the
models used. The effect of the composition can be studied through the analysis
of the cooling curve of the star. In addition, we consider the effect of
rotation, as in this case the particle composition of the star can be modified
quite drastically.

interesting nonmonotonic behavior of the condensate fraction in the vicinity of

interaction is continuously tuned across the BCS-BEC crossover. The unitary
regime thus demonstrates a robust paradigm of superfluidity even when the
disorder is introduced. To support the above feature and shed light on a

The dependence from the vacancy density is evaluated, highlighting a deviation
from linearity in the high-damage-density regime. A considerable increase (up
to 5%) in the real part of the index is observed, attributed to an increase in
polarizability, thus offering new microfabrication possibilities for waveguides

the uncertainty in the treatment of convection does not affect the result
significantly. The decrease in metallicity leads to decrease in opacity and
hence increase in luminosity of a star. This makes the star compact and results
in decrease in the density contrast, which is favorable to the

Since the effective temperature and the luminosity of metal-poor stars are
significantly higher than those of Pop I stars, the stars showing $\gamma$

issues of Laser Wake Field Acceleration (LWFA). The influence of stochastic
acceleration on the trapping of electrons is compared to the one of cold
injection. It is shown that when considering a high intensity wave perturbed by
a low intensity counter-propagating wave, in the non-linear blowout regime, the
influence of the colliding pulses polarizations (either parallel linear or
positive circular) on the beam quality seems weak when the electron density is
below $\sim 10^{-3}$ critical density. The effect of a homogenous constant
magnetic field $B_0$, parallel to the direction of propagation of the pump
pulse, is studied in the blowout regime. Transverse currents are generated at
the rim of the bubble, which results in the amplification of the $B_0$ field at
the rear of the bubble. Without $B_0$ field the beam periodically explodes and
re-confines, this phenomenon is suppressed when $B_0$ reaches some threshold,
which is a function of the laser pulses parameters (intensity, waist,
duration). Therefore the dynamics of the beam is modified, its maximum energy
is slightly boosted and above all transverse emittance reduced. Moreover the
low energy tail, observed in the non magnetized case, can be completely
suppressed leading to very sharp mono-energetic beam when $B_0$ is applied. If
the available $B_0$ field is limited then one has to fine-tune the
spatio-temporal shape and intensity of the colliding pulse in order to get an
acute control on the beam quality.

constructs the first principal path in an analogous way to standard linear

the sampling frequency solely determines the optimal rate of convergence when

optimal rate of convergence is determined jointly by the sampling frequency and
the number of curves when the sampling frequency is relatively small. When it
is large, the sampling frequency has no effect on the optimal rate. Another
interesting contrast between the two settings is that smoothing is necessary

physical system, all prepared by a source in the unknown state. In the limit of
very many copies measured, the often-used maximum-likelihood (ML) method for
converting the gathered data into an estimate of the state works very well. For
smaller data sets, however, it often suffers from problems of rank deficiency
in the estimated state. For many systems of relevance for quantum information
processing, the preparation of a very large number of copies of the same
quantum state is still a technological challenge, which motivates us to look
for estimation strategies that perform well even when there is not much data.
In this article, we review the concept of minimax state estimation, and use
minimax ideas to construct a simple estimator for quantum states. We
demonstrate that, for the case of tomography of a single qubit, our estimator
significantly outperforms the ML estimator for small number of copies of the

natural dependence on the number of copies measured, which is missing in the ML
estimator.

overview of the basis of (non-relativistic) QM measurement theory expressed in
density matrix formalism. The focus is on applications to the theory of weak
measurement, as developed by Aharonov and Vaidman and their collaborators.
Their development of weak measurement combined with what they call
'post-selection' - judiciously choosing not only the initial state of a system
('pre-selection') but also its final state - has received much attention
recently. Not the least has it opened up new, fruitful experimental vistas,
like novel approaches to amplification. But the approach has also attached to
it some air of mystery. I will attempt to 'de-mystify' it by showing that
(almost) all results can be derived in a straight-forward way from conventional
QM. Among other things, I develop the formalism not only to first order but
also to second order in the weak interaction responsible for the measurement.
This also allows me to derive, more or less as a by-product, the master
equation for the density matrix of an open system in interaction with an
environment. One particular application I shall treat of the weak measurement
is the so called Leggett-Garg inequalities, a k a 'Bell inequalities in time'.
I also give an outline, even if rough, of some of the ingenious experiments
that the work by Aharonov, Vaidman and collaborators has inspired. If anything
is magic in the weak measurement + post-selection approach, it is the
interpretation of the so called weak value of an observable. Is it a bona fide
property of the system considered? I have no answer to this question; I shall
only exhibit the pros and cons of the proposed interpretation.

repulsive Hubbard-type interaction U form a doublon, a long-living excitation
the decay of which is suppressed because of energy conservation. By means of an
exact-diagonalization approach based on the Krylov-space technique, we study
the dynamics of a single doublon, of two doublons, and of a doublon in the
presence of two additional fermions prepared locally in the initial state of
the extended Hubbard model. The time dependence of the expectation value of the
double occupancy at the different sites of a large one-dimensional lattice is
analyzed by perturbative arguments. In this way the spatiotemporal evolution of
the doublon can be understood. The initial decay takes place on a short time
scale 1/U, and the long-time average of the decayed fraction of the total
double occupancy scales as 1/U^2 . We demonstrate how the dynamics of a doublon
in the initial state is related to the spectrum of two-fermion excitations
obtained from linear-response theory, we work out the difference between
doublons composed of fermions vs doublons composed of bosons, and we show that
despite the increase of phase space for inelastic decay processes, the
stability of a doublon is enhanced by the presence of additional fermions on an
intermediate time scale.

study is to combine the points of view of model selection and functional
regression by using a factor approach: it is assumed that the predictor vector
can be decomposed into a sum of two uncorrelated random components reflecting
common factors and specific variabilities of the explanatory variables. It is
shown that the traditional assumption of a sparse vector of parameters is
restrictive in this context. Common factors may possess a significant influence
on the response variable which cannot be captured by the specific effects of a
small number of individual variables. We therefore propose to include principal
components as additional explanatory variables in an augmented regression
model. We give finite sample inequalities for estimates of these components. It
is then shown that model selection procedures can be used to estimate the
parameters of the augmented model, and we derive theoretical properties of the
estimators. Finite sample performance is illustrated by a simulation study.

energy threshold for hillock formation another threshold exists above which
triangular pits are observed after etching. This threshold depends on both the
potential and kinetic energies of the incident ion. Simulations indicate that
this second threshold is associated with the formation of defect aggregates in
the topmost layers of CaF$_2$.

reduce the $\chi^2_{min}$ of the HDE model by 2.16. We also find that, unlike
the original HDE model with a phantom-like behavior in the future, the GHDE

a novel method so called MPE (multiproduct expansion method), which include
higher order extrapolation schemes.

(U)LIRG class. Knots in (U)LIRGs are likely to contain sub-strucutre. Evidence
is found that in ULIRGs they are intrinsically more luminous than in less
luminous interacting systems due to size-of-sample effects. Furthermore, their
sizes and masses are similar to stellar complexes or clumps detected in
galaxies at z > 1, unlike local stellar complexes. The star formation in
(U)LIRGs is charaterized by a luminosity function with a slope consistent with
\alpha = 2, independent of the luminosity of the system. However, it may
flatten slightly due to, as simulations suggest, higher knot formation rates at
early phases of the interaction. Candidates to tidal dwarf galaxies are
identified in the sample. With a production rate of 0.1 candidates per (U)LIRG
system, only a few fraction (< 10%) of the general dwarf satellite population
could be of tidal origin.

considered in this paper, which is the line of defence for brokers against risk
associated with margin trading. The conditional probability of negative return
is used as risk measure, and a recursive algorithm is proposed to realize this
measure under a Markov chain model. Optimal margin system is chosen from those
systems which satisfy the constraint of the risk measure. The resulted margin
system is able to adjust actively with respect to the changes of stock prices.
The margin system required by the Shanghai Stock Exchange is compared with the
proposed system, where 25,200 margin loans of 126 stocks listed on the SSE are
investigated. It is found that the number of margin calls under the proposed
margin system is significantly less than its counterpart under the required
system for the same level of risk, and the average costs of the loans are
similar under the two types of margin systems.

are frequently observed in both low mass X-ray binaries and active galactic
nuclei. For the former case it is generally accepted that the excess arises due
to iron emission, but there is some controversy over whether their width is
partially enhanced by instrumental processes, and hence also over the intrinsic
broadening mechanism. Meanwhile, in the latter case, the origin of this feature
is still subject to debate; physically motivated reflection and absorption
interpretations are both able to reproduce the observed spectra. In this work
we make use of the contemporaneous BeppoSAX data to demonstrate that the
breadth of the excess observed in XTE J1650-500 is astrophysical rather than
instrumental, and proceed to highlight the similarity of the excesses present
in this source and MGC-6-30-15. Both optically thick accretion discs and
optically thin coronae, which in combination naturally give rise to
relativistically-broadened iron lines when the disc extends close to the black
hole, are commonly observed in both class of object. The simplest solution is
that the broad emission features present arise from a common process, which we
argue must be reflection from the inner regions of an accretion disc around a
rapidly rotating black hole; for XTE J1650-500 we find spin constraints of 0.84

prone regions (R2) had inhomogeneous helicity flux distribution with mixed
helicities of both signs and that of CME prone regions had almost homogeneous
distribution of helicity flux dominated by single sign. The temporal profiles
of helicity injection showed impulsive variations during some flares/CMEs due
to negative helicity injection into the dominant region of positive helicity

helicity flux with CMEs but not flares in AR 11158, while for the AR 11166, we

of isostatic and hyperstatic sphere packings obtained via exact enumeration.
The number of nonisomorphic isostatic packings grows exponentially with the
number of spheres $N$, and their diversity of structure and symmetry increases
with increasing $N$ and decreases with increasing hyperstaticity $H \equiv N_c
- N_{ISO}$, where $N_c$ is the number of pair contacts and $N_{ISO} = 3N-6$.
Maximally contacting packings are in general neither the densest nor the most
symmetric. Analyses of local structure show that the fraction $f$ of nuclei
with order compatible with the bulk (RHCP) crystal decreases sharply with
increasing $N$ due to a high propensity for stacking faults, 5- and near-5-fold
symmetric structures, and other motifs that preclude RHCP order. While $f$
increases with increasing $H$, a significant fraction of hyperstatic nuclei for
$N$ as small as 11 retain non-RHCP structure. Classical theories of nucleation
that consider only spherical nuclei, or only nuclei with the same ordering as
the bulk crystal, cannot capture such effects. Our results provide an
explanation for the failure of classical nucleation theory for hard-sphere
systems of $N\lesssim 10$ particles; we argue that in this size regime, it is
essential to consider nuclei of unconstrained geometry. Our results are also
applicable to understanding kinetic arrest and jamming in systems that interact
via hard-core-like repulsive and short-ranged attractive interactions.

European FEL in the soft X-ray regime. A high longitudinal coherence will be
the key to such performance upgrade. In order to reach this goal we study a
very compact soft X-ray self-seeding scheme originally designed at SLAC [1,2].
The scheme is based on a grating monochromator, and can be straightforwardly
installed in the SASE3 undulator beamline at the European XFEL. For the
European XFEL fully-coherent soft X-ray pulses are particularly valuable since
they naturally support the extraction of more FEL power than at saturation by
exploiting tapering in the tunable-gap SASE3 undulator. Tapering consists of a
stepwise change of the undulator gap from segment to segment. Based on
start-to-end simulations we show that soft X-ray FEL power reaches about 800
GW, that is about an order of magnitude higher than the SASE level at
saturation (100 GW). The self-seeding setup studied in this work is extremely
compact (about 5 m long), and cost-effective. This last characteristic may
justify to consider it as a possible addition to the European XFEL capabilities
from the very beginning of the operation phase.

simulations of a Milky--Way-sized halo, aimed at studying the effect of
feedback on the nature of gas accretion. Simulations include a model of
inter-stellar medium and star formation, in which SN explosions provide
effective thermal feedback. We distinguish between gas accretion onto the halo,
which occurs when gas particles cross the halo virial radius, and gas accretion
onto the central galaxy, which takes place when gas particles cross the inner
one-tenth of the virial radius. Gas particles can be accreted through three
different channels, depending on the maximum temperature value, $T_{\rm max}$,
reached during the particles' past evolution: a cold channel for $T_{\rm
max}<2.5 \times 10^5$ K, a hot one for $T>10^6$K, and a warm one for
intermediate values of $T_{\rm max}$. We find that the warm channel is at least
as important as the cold one for gas accretion onto the central galaxy. This
result is at variance with previous findings that the cold mode dominates gas
accretion at high redshift. We ascribe this difference to the different
supernova feedback scheme implemented in our simulations. While results
presented so far in the literature are based on uneffective SN thermal feedback
schemes and/or the presence of a kinetic feedback, our simulations include only
effective thermal feedback. We argue that observational detections of a warm
accretion mode in the high--redshift circum-galactic medium would provide
useful constraints on the nature of the feedback that regulates star formation
in galaxies.

asymptotic behavior of the complex density function is related to the complex
resonance energy and system's threshold energy, and the function's local
oscillatory behavior is connected with preferential directions of electron
decay. Practical considerations for implementation of the theory are addressed
including sensitivity to the complex-scaling parameter, $\theta$. In Kohn-Sham
DFRT, it is shown that almost all $\theta$-dependence in the calculated
energies and lifetimes can be extinguished via use of a proper basis set or
fine grid. The highest occupied Kohn-Sham orbital energy and lifetime are
related to a physical affinity and width, and the threshold energy of the
Kohn-Sham system is shown to be equal to the threshold energy of the
interacting system shifted by a well-defined functional. Finally, various
complex-scaling conditions are derived which relate the functionals of
ground-state DFT to those of DFRT via proper scaling factors and a

\times \mathbb{Z}_2$-color Lie superalgebra have been studied. All the filiform
$\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$-color Lie superalgebras can be obtained by
means of infinitesimal deformations, hence the importance of these. Thus, in
particular, we give a family of filiform $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times
\mathbb{Z}_2$-color Lie superalgebras via linearly integrable deformations.

  Only Local Information","This report contains the proofs of the results presented at HiCoNS
  2012",,,,"cs.DC cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of resilient consensus in the presence of
misbehaving nodes. Although it is typical to assume knowledge of at least some
nonlocal information when studying secure and fault-tolerant consensus
algorithms, this assumption is not suitable for large-scale dynamic networks.
To remedy this, we emphasize the use of local strategies to deal with
resilience to security breaches. We study a consensus protocol that uses only
local information and we consider worst-case security breaches, where the
compromised nodes have full knowledge of the network and the intentions of the
other nodes. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the normal
nodes to reach consensus despite the influence of the malicious nodes under
different threat assumptions. These conditions are stated in terms of a novel
graph-theoretic property referred to as network robustness.

performance. How to discover the coding opportunity in relay nodes is really
important for it. There are more coding chances, there are more times it can
improve network throughput by network coding operation. In this paper, an
extended network coding opportunity discovery scheme (ExCODE) is proposed,
which is realized by appending the current node ID and all its 1-hop neighbors'
IDs to the packet. ExCODE enables the next hop relay node to know which nodes
else have already overheard the packet, so it can discover the potential coding
opportunities as much as possible. ExCODE expands the region of discovering
coding chance to n-hops, and have more opportunities to execute network coding
operation in each relay node. At last, we implement ExCODE over the AODV
protocol, and efficiency of the proposed mechanism is demonstrated with NS2
simulations, compared to the existing coding opportunity discovery scheme.
