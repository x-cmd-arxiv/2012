  nanowire",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electric control of individual atoms or molecules in a solid-state system
offers a promising way to bring quantum mechanical functionalities into
electronics. This idea has recently come into the reach of the established
domain of silicon technology, leading to the realization of single-atom
transistors and to the first measurements of electron spin dynamics in single
donors. Here we show that we can electrically couple two donors embedded in a
multi-gate silicon transistor, and induce coherent oscillations in their charge
states by means of microwave signals. We measure single-electron tunneling
across the two donors, which reveals their energy spectrum. The lowest energy
states, corresponding to a single electron located on either of the two donors,
form a two-level system (TLS) well separated from all other electronic levels.
Gigahertz driving of this TLS results in a quantum interference pattern
associated with the absorption or the stimulated emission of up to ten
microwave photons. We estimate a charge dephasing time of 0.3 nanoseconds,
consistent with other types of charge quantum bits. Here, however, the
relatively short coherence time can be counterbalanced by fast operation
signals (in principle up to 1 terahertz) as allowed by the large empty energy
window separating ground and excited states in donor atoms. The demonstrated
coherent coupling of two donors constitutes an essential step towards
donor-based quantum computing devices in silicon.

parameters like triglycerides and cholesterol were observed in obese and
diabetic mice+Kal-1 than control (lean) mice fed on low fat diet, though the
optimum amounts of Kal-1 were 20 and 75 {\mu}g in first and second group

certain entities. In Experiment 1, the experimenter described spatial locations
of fictitious objects sequentially in two conditions: speech condition (SO,
verbal descriptions clearly indicated the spatial layout) and speech and
gesture condition (SR, verbal descriptions were ambiguous but accompanied by
robotic pointing gestures). Participants were then asked to recall the objects'
spatial locations. We found that the number of spatial locations recalled in
the SR condition was on par with that in the SO condition, suggesting that
telerobotic pointing gestures compensated ambiguous speech during the process
of spatial information. In Experiment 2, the experimenter described spatial
locations non-sequentially in the SR and SO conditions. Surprisingly, the
number of spatial locations recalled in the SR condition was even higher than
that in the SO condition, suggesting that telerobotic pointing gestures were
more powerful than speech in conveying spatial information when information was

these gestures with co-occurring speech. This work promotes engaging remote

an entirely elementary classical analysis argument, using only the implicit
function theorem and elementary facts about power series and Newton polyhedra.
Several examples are given. The methods are quite different from traditional
resolution of singularities methods. In a separate paper arxiv:1104.4684, the
methods of this paper (but for the most part not the resolution of
singularities theorems themselves) are used to prove results concerning
oscillatory integrals, exponential sums, and related matters.
  Note: This paper should be viewed as a replacement for the resolution of

monomial maps not necessarily being one to one. Secondly, the complicated
iterated domain subdivisions using Newton polyhedra that were done in

population mixture are taken into account. The results show some UV-upturn SEDs
naturally for bsCSPs. The SEDs of bsCSPs are affected obviously by all of three
stellar population parameters, and the effects of three parameters are
degenerate. This suggests that the effects of metallicity, and the ages of the
old (major in stellar mass) and young (minor) components of stellar populations
should be taken into account in SED studies of early-type galaxies. The
sensitivities of SEDs at different wavelengths to the inputs of a stellar
population model are also investigated. It is shown that UV SEDs are sensitive
to all of three stellar population parameters, rather than to only stellar age.
Special wavelength ranges according to some SED features that are relatively
sensitive to stellar metallicity, young-component age, and old-component age of
bsCSPs are found by this work. For example, the shapes of SEDs with wavelength
ranges of 5110-5250AA, 5250--5310AA, 5310--5350AA, 5830--5970AA, 20950--23550AA
are relatively sensitive to the stellar metallicity of bsCSPs. The shapes of
SEDs within 965-985AA, 1005--1055AA, 1205--1245AA are sensitive to
old-component age, while SED features within the wavelength ranges of
2185--2245AA, 2455--2505AA, 2505--2555AA, 2775--2825AA, 2825--2875AA to
young-component age.

orientational model for water, originally proposed by Bell and Lavis. The model
presents two liquid phases separated by a critical line. The difference between
the two phases is the presence of structure in the liquid of lower density,
described through orientational order of particles. We have considered the
effect of small inert solute on the solvent thermodynamic phases. Solute
stabilizes the structure of solvent, by the organization of solvent particles
around solute particles, at low temperatures. Thus, even at very high
densities, the solution presents clusters of structured water particles
surrounding solute inert particles, in a region in which pure solvent would be
free of structure. Solute intercalates with solvent, a feature which has been
suggested by experimental and atomistic simulation data. Examination of solute
solubility has yielded a minimum in that property, which may be associated with
the minimum found for noble gases. We have obtained a line of minimum
solubility (TmS) across the phase diagram, accompanying the line of maximum in
density (TMD). This coincidence is easily explained for non-interacting solute
and it is in agreement with earlier results in the literature. We give a simple
argument which suggests that interacting solute would dislocate TmS to higher
temperatures.

reliable source types from the literature. They mostly correspond to various
types of stars (611), active galactic nuclei (AGN, 753) and compact object
systems (138) containing white dwarfs, neutron stars, and stellar-mass black
holes. We find that about 99% of stars can be separated from other source types
based on their low X-ray-to-IR flux ratios and frequent X-ray flares. AGN have
remarkably similar X-ray spectra, with the power-law photon index centered
around 1.91+-0.31, and their 0.2-4.5 keV flux long-term variation factors have
a median of 1.48 and 98.5% less than 10. In contrast, 70% of compact object
systems can be very soft or hard, highly variable in X-rays, and/or have very
large X-ray-to-IR flux ratios, separating them from AGN. Using these results,
we derive a source type classification scheme to classify the other sources and
find 644 candidate stars, 1376 candidate AGN and 202 candidate compact object
systems, whose false identification probabilities are estimated to be about 1%,
3% and 18%, respectively. There are still 320 associated with nearby galaxies

that the use of a dimensional regulator for ultraviolet divergences, induced
due to presence of the cusps on the loop, yields anomalies that break both
conformal symmetry and supersymmetry. At one-loop order, these are present only
in Grassmann components localized in the vicinity of a single cusp and result
in a universal function for any number of sites of the polygon that can be
subtracted away in a systematic manner leaving a well-defined supersymmetric
remainder dual to corresponding components of the superamplitude. The question
remains though whether components which were free from the aforementioned
supersymmetric anomaly at leading order of perturbation theory remain so once
computed at higher orders. Presently we verify this fact by calculating a
particular component of the null polygonal super Wilson loop at two loops
restricting the contour kinematics to a two-dimensional subspace. This allows
one to perform all computations in a concise analytical form and trace the
pattern of cancellations between individual Feynman graphs in a transparent
fashion. As a consequence of our consideration we obtain a dual conformally
invariant result for the remainder function in agreement with one-loop NMHV
amplitudes.

kinetic description of a particle system combining a noisy Cucker-Smale
consensus force and self-propulsion. In the large self-propulsion force limit,
we provide evidence of a phase transition from disordered to ordered motion
which manifests itself as a change of type of the limit model (from hyperbolic
to diffusive) at the crossing of a critical noise intensity. In the hyperbolic
regime, the resulting model, referred to as the `Self-Organized Hydrodynamics
(SOH)', consists of a system of compressible Euler equations with a speed
constraint. We show that the range of SOH models obtained by this limit is
restricted. To waive this restriction, we compute the Navier-Stokes diffusive
corrections to the hydrodynamic model. Adding these diffusive corrections, the
limit of a large propulsion force yields unrestricted SOH models and offers an
alternative to the derivation of the SOH using kinetic models with speed
constraints.

in a social network has a unique piece of a jigsaw puzzle. Acquainted people
with compatible puzzle pieces merge their puzzle pieces. More generally, groups
of people with merged puzzle pieces merge if the groups know one another and
have a pair of compatible puzzle pieces. The social network solves the puzzle
if it eventually merges all the puzzle pieces. For an Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
social network with $n$ vertices and edge probability $p_n$, we define the
critical value $p_c(n)$ for a connected puzzle graph to be the $p_n$ for which
the chance of solving the puzzle equals $1/2$. We prove that for the $n$-cycle
(ring) puzzle, $p_c(n)=\Theta(1/\log n)$, and for an arbitrary connected puzzle
graph with bounded maximum degree, $p_c(n)=O(1/\log n)$ and $\omega(1/n^b)$ for
any $b>0$. Surprisingly, with probability tending to 1 as the network size
increases to infinity, social networks with a power-law degree distribution
cannot solve any bounded-degree puzzle. This model suggests a mechanism for
recent empirical claims that innovation increases with social density, and it
might begin to show what social networks stifle creativity and what networks

have elements given by sums over the SOV spectrum of the product of the
coefficients of separate states. This SOV analysis is not reduced to the case
of the elliptic roots of unit and the results here derived define the required
setup to extend to the dynamical 6-vertex model the approach recently developed

criterion is introduced to find simultaneous eigenvalues of these two transfer

a protoplanetary disk, which is created by gap opening by Jupiter. A core
formed via planetesimal accretion induces the fragmentation of surrounding
planetesimals, which generally inhibits further growth of the core by removal
of the resulting fragments due to radial drift caused by gas drag. However, the
emergence of the pressure maximum halts the drift of the fragments, while their
orbital eccentricities and inclinations are efficiently damped by gas drag. As
a result, the core of Saturn rapidly grows via accretion of the fragments near
the pressure maximum. We have found that in the minimum-mass solar nebula,
kilometer sized planetesimals can produce a core exceeding 10 Earth masses
within two million years. Since Jupiter may not have undergone significant type
II inward migration, it is likely that Jupiter's formation was completed when
the local disk mass has already decayed to a value comparable to or less than
Jovian mass. The expected rapid growth of Saturn's core on a timescale
comparable to or shorter than observationally inferred disk lifetime enables
Saturn to acquire the current amount of envelope gas before the disk gas is
completely depleted. The high heat energy release rate onto the core surface
due to the rapid accretion of the fragments delays onset of runaway gas
accretion until the core mass becomes somewhat larger than that of Jupiter,
which is consistent with the estimate based on interior modeling. Therefore,
the rapid formation of Saturn induced by gap opening of Jupiter can account for
the formation of multiple gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) without significant
inward migration and larger core mass of Saturn than that of Jupiter.

exiting from it at the following big bang. This happens cyclically again and
again without violating the null energy condition. There is a special subset of
geodesically complete non-generic solutions which perform zero-size bounces
without ever entering the antigravity regime in all cycles. For these, initial

paper ball in a waste-bin consists of as much as 80% air. Similarly, if one
folds a sheet of paper repeatedly in two, the necessary force becomes so large

therefore simple folding models allow to capture also the main features of
crumpling. An original geometrical approach shows that crumpling is
hierarchical, just as the repeated folding. For both processes the number of
layers increases with the degree of compaction. We nd that for both processes
the crumpling force increases as a power law with the number of folded layers,

controls the exponent of the scaling law between the force and the compaction
ratio.

deformation of a Lie algebra by claiming that the limit $1/c \rightarrow 0$,
when c is the speed of light, of the composition law $(u,v) \rightarrow
(u+v)/(1+(uv/c^2))$ of speeds in special relativity (Poincar\'e group) should
produce the composition law $(u,v) \rightarrow u + v $ used in classical
mechanics (Galil\'ee group). However, the dimensionless composition law
$(u'=u/c,v'=v/c) \rightarrow (u'+v')/(1+u'v')$ does not contain any longer a
perturbation parameter. Nevertheless, this idea brought the birth of the ""
deformation theory of algebraic structures"", culminating in the use of the
Chevalley-Eilenberg cohomology of Lie algebras and one of the first
applications of computer algebra in the seventies. One may also notice that the
main idea of general relativity is to deform the Minkowski metric of space-time
by means of the small dimensionless parameter $\phi/c^2$ where $\phi=GM/r$ is
the gravitational potential at a distance r of a central attractive mass M with
gravitational constant G. A few years later, a "" deformation theory of
geometric structures "" on manifolds of dimension n was introduced and one may
quote riemannian, symplectic or complex analytic structures. Though often
conjectured, the link between the two approaches has never been exhibited and
the aim of this paper is to provide the solution of this problem by new
methods. The key tool is made by the "" Vessiot structure equations "" (1903) for
Lie groups or Lie pseudogroups of transformations, which, contrary to the ""
Cartan structure equations "", are still unknown today and contain "" structure
constants "" which, like in the case of constant riemannian curvature, have in
general nothing to do with any Lie algebra. The main idea is then to introduce
the purely differential Janet sequence $0 \rightarrow \Theta \rightarrow T
\rightarrow F_0 \rightarrow F_1 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow F_n \rightarrow 0$
as a resolution of the sheaf $\Theta \subset T$ of infinitesimal
transformations and to induce a purely algebraic "" deformation sequence "" with
finite dimensional vector spaces and linear maps, even if $\Theta$ is infinite
dimensional. The infinitesimal equivalence problem for geometric structures has
to do with the local exactness at $ F_0 $ of the Janet sequence while the
deformation problem for algebraic structures has to do with the exactness of
the deformation sequence at the invariant sections of $F_1 $, that is ONE STEP
FURTHER ON in the sequence and this unexpected result explains why the many
tentatives previously quoted have not been successful. Finally, we emphasize
through examples the part that could be played by computer algebra in any
explicit computation.

  turbulence steady states and equilibria",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the 2D Euler equations and related models of geophysical flows, minima of
energy--Casimir variational problems are stable steady states of the equations
(Arnol'd theorems). The same variational problems also describe sets of
statistical equilibria of the equations. In this paper, we make use of
Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction in order to study the bifurcation diagrams for
these variational problems, in the limit of small energy or, equivalently, of
small departure from quadratic Casimir functionals. We show a generic
occurrence of phase transitions, either continuous or discontinuous. We derive
the type of phase transitions for any domain geometry and any model analogous
to the 2D Euler equations. The bifurcations depend crucially on a_4, the
quartic coefficient in the Taylor expansion of the Casimir functional around
its minima. Note that a_4 can be related to the fourth moment of the vorticity
in the statistical mechanics framework. A tricritical point (bifurcation from a
continuous to a discontinuous phase transition) often occurs when a_4 changes
sign. The bifurcations depend also on possible constraints on the variational
problems (circulation, energy). These results show that the analytical results
obtained with quadratic Casimir functionals by several authors are non-generic
(not robust to a small change in the parameters).

of higher dimensional fuzzy hyperboloids (ultra-hyperboloids) based on
non-compact Hopf maps. Two types of non-compact Hopf maps; split-type and

arbitrary even-dimensional fuzzy ultra-hyperboloids by applying the Schwinger
operator formalism and indefinite Clifford algebras. It is shown that fuzzy
hyperboloids, $H_F^{2p,2q}$, are represented by the coset, $H_F^{2p,2q}\simeq
SO(2p,2q+1)/U(p,q)$, and exhibit two types of generalized dimensional
hierarchy; hyperbolic-type (for $q\neq 0$) and hybrid-type (for $q=0$). Fuzzy
hyperboloids can be expressed as fibre-bundle of fuzzy fibre over hyperbolic
basemanifold. Such bundle structure of fuzzy hyperboloid gives rise to
non-compact monopole gauge field. Physical realization of fuzzy hyperboloids is
argued in the context of lowest Landau level physics.

Lagrangian coherent structures in three-dimensional (3d) turbulent flows.
Lagrangian coherent structures act as the organizers of transport in fluid
flows and are crucial to understand their stirring and mixing properties.
Generalized maxima (ridges) of the FSLE fields are used to locate these
coherent structures.
  Three-dimensional FSLE fields are calculated in two phenomenologically
distinct turbulent flows: a wall-bounded flow (channel flow) and a regional
oceanic flow obtained by numerical solution of the primitive equations where
two-dimensional turbulence dominates.
  In the channel flow, autocorrelations of the FSLE field show that the
structure is substantially different from the near wall to the mid-channel
region and relates well to the more widely studied Eulerian coherent structure
of the turbulent channel flow. The ridges of the FSLE field have complex shapes
due to the 3d character of the turbulent fluctuations.
  In the oceanic flow, strong horizontal stirring is present and the flow
regime is similar to that of 2d turbulence where the domain is populated by
coherent eddies that interact strongly. This in turn results in the presence of
high FSLE lines throughout the domain leading to strong non-local mixing. The
ridges of the FSLE field are quasi-vertical surfaces, indicating that the
horizontal dynamics dominates the flow. Indeed, due to rotation and
stratification, vertical motions in the ocean are much less intense than
horizontal ones. This suppression is absent in the channel flow, as the 3d
character of the FSLE ridges shows.

dictions and the natural data for the Austroalpine of the Western Alps agree
very well in terms of P-T peak conditions, relative chronology of peak and
exhumation events, P-T-t paths, thermal gradients and the tectonic evolu- tion
of the continental rocks. These findings suggest that a pre-collisional
evolution of this domain, with the burial of the continental rocks (induced by
ablative subduction of the overriding Adria plate) and their exhumation (driven
by an upwelling flow generated in a hydrated mantle wedge) could be a valid

splitting the information-bearing symbols of each user into common and private
parts, is sufficient to achieve all the rate pairs in the derived capacity
region. The capacity result is applied to obtain an achievable rate region for
the double-unicast networks with random network coding at the intermediate
nodes, which can be modeled by the two-user MIMO linear deterministic IC
studied. It is shown that the newly proposed achievable region is strictly
larger than the existing regions in the literature.

Angular Differential Mode and with Sparse Aperture Masking (SAM). We analyse
the data as well as the artefacts that can be produced by ADI reduction on an
extended structure with a shape similar to that of HR4796A dust ring. We
determine constraints on the presence of companions using SAM and ADI on
HR4796A, and ADI on HR4796B. We also performed dynamical simulations of a disk
of planetesimals and dust produced by collisions, perturbed by a planet located
close to the disk outer edge. The disk ring around HR4796A is well resolved. We
highlight the potential effects of ADI reduction of the observed disk shape and
surface brightness distribution, and side-to-side asymmetries. No planet is
detected around the star, with masses as low as 3.5 M_Jup at 0.5"" (58 AU) and
less than 3 M_Jup in the 0.8-1"" range along the semi-major axis. We exclude
massive brown dwarfs at separations as close as 60 mas (4.5 AU) from the star
thanks to SAM data. The detection limits obtained allow us to exclude a
possible close companion to HR4796A as the origin of the offset of the ring
center with respect to the star; they also allow to put interesting constraints
on the (mass, separation) of any planet possibly responsible for the inner disk
steep edge. Using detailed dynamical simulations, we show that a giant planet
orbiting outside the ring could sharpen the disk outer edge and reproduce the
STIS images published by Schneider et al. (2009).

composed of three main contributions: diffuse emission from cosmic ray

compact source populations. The diffuse emission and emission from the extended

inner Galaxy, preventing the detection of isolated compact sources. In spite of
this difficulty, compact sources in the Galactic plane can be singled out based
on the variability properties of their gamma-ray emission. Our aim is to find

systematic study of the emission variability from the Galactic plane, by
constructing the variability maps. We find that emission from several
directions along the Galactic plane is significantly variable on a time scale
of months. These directions include, in addition to known variable Galactic
sources and background blazars, the Galactic ridge region at positive Galactic
longitudes and several regions containing young pulsars. We argue that
variability on the time scale of months may be common to pulsars, originating
from the inner parts of pulsar wind nebulae, similarly to what is observed in

at which a marked transition occurs between correlated and anti-correlated

Reduction of the nitrogen content in the 4 nm thick NbN films results in a more
than two orders of magnitude decrease of the dark count rates and in a red
shift of the cut-off wavelength of the hot-spot SNSPD response. The observed
phenomena are explained by an improvement of uniformity of NbN films that has

considered as the most crucial for both the cut-off wavelength and the dark

of the temperature stratification of the photosphere of the Sun and of other
cool stars, thanks to their LTE opacities and source functions and their large
span in formation height. The aim of this study is to calibrate the usage of
the H and K wings in one-dimensional interpretation of spatially averaged
spectra and in deriving per-pixel stratifications from resolved spectra. I use
multi-dimensional simulations of solar convection to synthesize the H and K
wings, derive one-dimensional models from these wings as if they were observed,
and compare the resulting models to the actual simulation input. I find that
spatially-averaged models constructed from the synthesized wings generally
match the simulation averages well, except for the deepest layers of the
photosphere where large thermal inhomogeneities and Planck-function
nonlinearity gives large errors. The larger the inhomogeneity, the larger the
latter. The presence of strong network fields increases such inhomogeneity. For
quiet photospheric conditions the temperature excesses reach about 200 K.
One-dimensional stratification fits of discrete structures such as granulation
and small-scale magnetic concentrations give satisfactory results with errors
that are primarily due to steep temperature gradients and abrupt changes of
temperature with depth. I conclude that stratification modeling using the H and
K wings is a useful technique for the interpretation of solar high-resolution
observations.

function of transverse momentum is found to be in good agreement with the
experimental data, but the absolute scale is underestimated by next-to-leading
order (NLO) pQCD. The inclusion of all-order resummation of large logarithmic
threshold corrections reduces the discrepancy from a factor of three to four to
a factor of two. The dependence of the cross section on the pseudo-rapidity and
on virtual photon energy fraction is investigated. Finally the dependence on
the charge of the hadrons is discussed.

evidences. We investigate the extended equatorial distribution around the early
bipolar planetary nebula M 2-9 (""Minkowski's Butterfly Nebula"") to gather new
information on the mechanism of the axial ejections. Interferometric millimeter
observations of molecular emission provide the most comprehensive view of the
equatorial mass distribution and kinematics in early PNe. Here we present
subarcsecond angular-resolution observations of the 12CO J=2-1 line and
continuum emission with the Plateau de Bure interferometer. The data reveal two
ring-shaped and eccentric structures at the equatorial basis of the two coaxial
optical lobes. The two rings were formed during short mass-loss episodes (~ 40
yr), separated by ~ 500 yr. Their positional and dynamical imprints provide
evidence of the presence of a binary stellar system at the center, which yields
critical information on its orbital characteristics, including a mass estimate
for the secondary of ~< 0.2 \ms. The presence of a stellar system with a
modest-mass companion at the center of such an elongated bipolar PN strongly
supports the binary-based models, because these are more easily able to explain
the frequent axisymmetric ejections in PNe.

TeV scale. The heavy neutrinos contribute to $\Delta L=2$ processes like
neutrinoless double beta decay and same-sign-dilepton production in the
colliders. The vacuum stability criterion also restricts the light-heavy
neutrino mixing and constrains the branching ratio of lepton flavour violating
process, like $\mu \to e \gamma$ mediated by the heavy neutrinos. We show that
neutrinoless double beta decay with a lifetime $\sim 10^{25}$ years can be
observed if the the lightest heavy neutrino mass is $<$ 4.5 TeV. We show that
the vacuum stability condition and the experimental bound on $\mu \rightarrow e

theory to consistently assign values to certain (finite) sets of observables in
a way that is non-contextual and consistent with quantum mechanics. If we
require non-contextuality, the consequence is that many observables must not
have pre-existing definite values. However, the Kochen-Specker theorem does not
allow one to determine which observables must be value indefinite. In this
paper we present an improvement on the Kochen-Specker theorem which allows one
to actually locate observables which are provably value indefinite. Various
technical and subtle aspects relating to this formal proof and its connection
to quantum mechanics are discussed. This result is then utilized for the
proposal and certification of a dichotomic quantum random number generator
operating in a three-dimensional Hilbert space.

previous attempts to extract the WIMP mass, cross-section and speed

alternative model-independent method based on parametrising the momentum

can be applied to a single experiment to extract information about the
distribution function, as well as information on the degenerate WIMP mass and
interaction cross-section combined in a single parameter. This degeneracy can
be broken by including data from additional experiments, meaning that the WIMP
mass and speed distribution can be recovered. We test the momentum
parametrisation method using mock datasets from proposed ton-scale direct
detection experiments, showing that it exhibits improved coverage properties
over previous methods, as well as significantly reduced bias. We are also able
to accurately reconstruct the shape of the WIMP speed distribution but
distinguishing between different underlying distributions remains difficult.

power nodes including femtocells, relays, and distributed antennas.
Unfortunately, the resulting interference environment is also becoming more
complicated, making evaluation of different communication strategies
challenging in both analysis and simulation. Leveraging recent applications of
stochastic geometry to analyze cellular systems, this paper proposes to analyze
downlink performance in a fixed-size cell, which is inscribed within a weighted
Voronoi cell in a Poisson field of interferers. A nearest out-of-cell
interferer, out-of-cell interferers outside a guard region, and cross-tier
interference are included in the interference calculations. Bounding the
interference power as a function of distance from the cell center, the total
interference is characterized through its Laplace transform. An equivalent
marked process is proposed for the out-of-cell interference under additional
assumptions. To facilitate simplified calculations, the interference
distribution is approximated using the Gamma distribution with second order
moment matching. The Gamma approximation simplifies calculation of the success
probability and average rate, incorporates small-scale and large-scale fading,
and works with co-tier and cross-tier interference. Simulations show that the
proposed model provides a flexible way to characterize outage probability and
rate as a function of the distance to the cell edge.

CR-dominated regions (CRDRs) rather than Photon-dominated regions (PDRs) of H_2
clouds where the star formation initial conditions are set, making CRs the
ultimate star-formation feedback factor in galaxies, able to operate even in
their most deeply dust-enshrouded environments. CR-controlled star formation
initial conditions naturally set the stage for a near-invariant stellar Initial
Mass Function (IMF) in galaxies as long as their average CR energy density
U_{CR} permeating their molecular ISM remains within a factor of ~10 of its
Galactic value. Nevertheless, in the extreme environments of the compact
starbursts found in merging galaxies, where U_{CR}\sim(few)x10^{3}U_{CR,Gal},
CRs dramatically alter the initial conditions of star formation. In the
resulting extreme CRDRs H_2 cloud fragmentation will produce far fewer low mass
(<8 M_{sol}) stars, yielding a top-heavy stellar IMF. This will be a generic
feature of CR-controlled star-formation initial conditions, lending a physical
base for a bimodal IMF during galaxy formation, with a top-heavy one for
compact merger-induced starbursts, and an ordinary IMF preserved for star
formation in isolated gas-rich disks. In this scheme the integrated galactic
IMFs (IGIMF) are expected to be strong functions of the star formation history
of galaxies.

young and massive gaseous giants. The process of giant planet formation is
terminated by the dissipation of gas in the protoplanetary disk. The gas-rich
disk around HD142527 features a small inner disk, a large gap from \sim10 to
\sim140AU, and a massive outer disk extending out to \sim300AU. The gap could
have been carved-out by a giant planet. We have imaged the outer regions of
this gap using the adaptive-optics camera NICI on Gemini South. Our images
reveal that the disk is dynamically perturbed. The outer boundary of the
roughly elliptical gap appears to be composed of several segments of spiral
arms. The stellar position is offset by 0.17+-0.02"" from the centroid of the
cavity, consistent with earlier imaging at coarser resolutions. These transient
morphological features are expected in the context of disk evolution in the
presence of a perturbing body located inside the cavity. We perform
hydro-dynamical simulations of the dynamical clearing of a gap in a disk. A
10Mjup body in a circular orbit at r = 90AU, perturbs the whole disks, even
after thousands of orbits. By then the model disk has an eccentric and
irregular cavity, flanked by tightly wound spiral arms, but it is still
evolving far from steady state. A particular transient configuration that is a
qualitative match to HD142527 is seen at 1.7Myr.

cluster sizes, provided that they are sufficiently dense (initial half mass

complicates its use as a diagnostic of the stellar formation environment.

alignment of the junction is sensitively affected by the interface spacing,
since this determines the charge transfer between EuO and the Cu electrodes.
Our calculations indicate that EuO epitaxially grown on Cu can act as a perfect

both the Eu-5d conduction band and the Eu-4f valence band states contributing
to the coherent transport. For epitaxial EuO on Cu a symmetry filtering is

temperature. The scaling behavior is manifestly different from that found for
other modes of flux penetration, such as that mediated by avalanches,
suggesting that multi-scaling is a powerful tool for the characterization of
roughened interfaces. We propose a scenario for vortex penetration based on
two-dimensional percolation and cluster aggregation for an inhomogeneously
disordered superconductor.

evolutionary dynamics of social dilemmas in the presence of ""cooperation
facilitators"". In our model, cooperators and defectors interact as in the
classical prisoner's dilemma game, where selection favors defection. However,
here the presence of a small number of cooperation facilitators enhances the
fitness (reproductive potential) of cooperators, while it does not alter that
of defectors. In a finite population of size N, the dynamics of the prisoner's
dilemma with facilitators is characterized by the probability that cooperation
takes over (fixation probability) and by the mean times to reach the absorbing
states. These quantities are computed exactly and using Fokker-Planck
equations. Our findings, corroborated by stochastic simulations, demonstrate
that the influence of facilitators crucially depends on the difference between
their density z and the game's cost-to-benefit ratio r. When z>r, the fixation
of cooperators is likely in a large population and, under weak selection
pressure, invasion and replacement of defection by cooperation is favored by
selection if b(z-r)(1-z)>1/N, where 0<b<= 1 is the cooperation payoff benefit.
When z<r, the fixation probability of cooperators is exponentially enhanced by
the presence of facilitators but defection is the dominating strategy.

Replacing the NH$_3$ with a larger molecule THF, superconducting transition
temperature increases to 25.2 K in Yb$_{0.2}$(THF)$_y$HfNCl, which is almost
the same as the highest $T_{\rm c}$ reported in the alkali-metals intercalated

moves towards the poles, with a preponderance of flux from the trailing spots.
Let us assume that there is a strong asymmetry in the sense that all activity
is in the Northern Hemisphere, then that excess flux will move to the North
Pole and reverse that pole, while nothing happens in the South. If later on,
there is a lot of activity in the South, then that flux will help reverse the
South Pole. In this way, we get two humps in solar activity and a corresponding
difference in time of reversals. Such difference was first noted by Babcock
(1959) from the very first observation of polar field reversal just after the
maximum of the strongly asymmetric solar cycle 19. At that time, the Southern
Hemisphere was most active before sunspot maximum and the South Pole duly
reversed first, followed by the Northern Hemisphere more than a year later,
when that hemisphere was most active. Solar cycles since then have had the
opposite asymmetry, with the Northern Hemisphere being most active early in the
cycle. Polar field reversals for these cycles have as expected happened first
in the North. This is especially noteworthy for the present solar cycle 24. We
suggest that the association of two peaks of solar activity when separated by
hemispheres with correspondingly different times of polar field reversals is a
general feature of the cycle.

a function of the variance of the small components, the density of large

quantify the region of parameters for which this algorithm achieves optimality

homogeneous measurement matrices is not optimal, a special ""seeding"" design of
a spatially-coupled measurement matrix allows to restore optimality.

being able to measure it, is required for the non-negative decomposition of
mutual information into redundant and synergistic information. Previous
attempts to formalize redundant or synergistic information struggle to capture
some desired properties. We introduce a new formalism for redundant information
and prove that it satisfies all the properties necessary outlined in earlier

capture redundancy. We also demonstrate the behaviour of this new measure for

appealing as it solves the puzzles of the standard hot big bang model and
naturally explains why the spectrum of cosmological perturbations is almost
scale invariant. It is also an ideal playground to discuss deep questions among
which is the quantum measurement problem in a cosmological context. Although
the large squeezing of the quantum state of the perturbations and the
phenomenon of decoherence explain many aspects of the quantum to classical
transition, it remains to understand how a specific outcome can be produced in
the early universe, in the absence of any observer. The Continuous Spontaneous
Localization (CSL) approach to quantum mechanics attempts to solve the quantum
measurement question in a general context. In this framework, the wavefunction
collapse is caused by adding new non linear and stochastic terms to the
Schroedinger equation. In this paper, we apply this theory to inflation, which
amounts to solving the CSL parametric oscillator case. We choose the
wavefunction collapse to occur on an eigenstate of the Mukhanov-Sasaki variable
and discuss the corresponding modified Schroedinger equation. Then, we compute
the power spectrum of the perturbations and show that it acquires a universal
shape with two branches, one which remains scale invariant and one with nS=4, a
spectral index in obvious contradiction with the Cosmic Microwave Background
(CMB) anisotropy observations. The requirement that the non-scale invariant
part be outside the observational window puts stringent constraints on the
parameter controlling the deviations from ordinary quantum mechanics...

$\gamma$-rays with the MAGIC-I Cherenkov telescope. We aim to model the
persistent non-thermal jet emission by monitoring and characterizing the very
high energy $\gamma$-ray emission of M87 during a low state. A total of 150\,h
of data were taken between 2005 and 2007 with the single MAGIC-I telescope, out
of which 128.6\,h survived the data quality selection. We also collected data
in the X-ray and \textit{Fermi}--LAT bands from the literature (partially
contemporaneous). No flaring activity was found during the campaign. The source
was found to be in a persistent low-emission state, which was at a confidence
level of $7\sigma$. We present the spectrum between 100\,GeV and 2\,TeV, which
is consistent with a simple power law with a photon index $\Gamma=2.21\pm0.21$
and a flux normalization at 300\,GeV of $(7.7\pm1.3) \times 10^{-8}$ TeV$^{-1}$
s$^{-1}$ m$^{-2}$. The extrapolation of the MAGIC spectrum into the GeV energy
range matches the previously published \textit{Fermi}--LAT spectrum well,
covering a combined energy range of four orders of magnitude with the same
spectral index. We model the broad band energy spectrum with a spine layer
model, which can satisfactorily describe our data.

computational approaches, which are rooted in a good understanding of the
physics of correlated electronic systems. Interacting electrons in a magnetic
field display a huge variety of eigenstates with different internal structures,
which have been probed experimentally in the Hall effect. The advent of
high-performing graphics processing units has lead to a boost in computational
speed in particular for classical systems. In the absence of a
quantum-computer, it is thus of importance to see how quantum-mechanical
problems can be cast into a seemingly classical dynamics, which can be
efficiently implemented. At the same time, such mappings provide insights into
the quantum-to-classical transition of many-body systems.

with the goal of defining a method for the formal specification of systems. The
idea of Layered Fault Tolerant Specification (LFTS) is proposed to make the
method extensible to fault tolerant systems. The principle is layering the
specification in different levels, the first one for the normal behavior and
the others for the abnormal. The abnormal behavior is described in terms of an
Error Injector (EI), which represents a model of the erroneous interference
coming from the environment. This structure has been inspired by the notion of
idealized fault tolerant component but the combination of LFTS and EI using
Rely/Guarantee reasoning to describe their interaction can be considered as a
novel contribution. The progress toward this method and this way to organize
fault tolerant specifications has been made experimenting on case studies and
an example is presented.

assembly. But obtaining a coherent components assembly is not an easy exercise.
To achieve this, we advocate a contractual approach distinguishing different
syntactic, structural, semantic, synchronization and service quality contracts.
We have successfully applied this approach on two models of semi-formal
contractual components: UML2.0 and Ugatze. Indeed, we propose two approaches:
VerifComponentUML2.0 and VerifComponentUgatze. The VerifComponentUML2.0
approach aims the verification of syntactic, structural, synchronization and
quality service contracts on a UML2.0 component assembly through two formal
component models Acme/Armani and Wright. VerifComponentUML2.0 has two tools:
Wr2fdr and Wright2Ada. The tool Wr2fdr allows translating Wright expression to
CSP contracts in order to verify synchronization using the model checker FDR.
It is a IDM tool Wright2Ada which allow is transforming Wright code to Ada, in
order to open UML2.0 on static analysis and dynamic tools associated with Ada.
VerifComponentUgatze approach provides a frame allowing to check syntactic and
structural contracts of an Ugatze component assembly through Acme/Armani.

the model checker FDR. After conducting an audit activity of this tool, we were
able to correct errors related to both properties 2 and 3. In addition, we
