this framework, the IR absorption spectra of 2- and 9-vinylanthracene were
measured in Ar matrices at 12 K and in CsI and polyethylene pellets at room
temperature. The laboratory spectra were analyzed with the support of
simulations based on the density functional theory. For each PAH molecule,
eight IR spectra were computed by combining the B3LYP functional with as many
different basis sets, namely 4-31G, 4-31G(d), 6-31G, 6-311G, 6-31G(d),
6-31G(d,p), 6-31+G(d,p), and 6-31++G(d,p). The comparison of the theoretical
spectra with the laboratory data allowed us to determine the most suitable
combinations for modeling the IR spectra of neutral PAH molecules that carry a
vinyl side group. It was concluded from the examples of 2- and 9-VA that the
optimum basis set is 6-31G unless a steric interaction has to be taken into
account, in which case the optimum basis set is 6-31G(d). Thus, in the presence
of such an interaction, the use of d-type polarization functions is
recommended. We discuss the possibility for neutral vinyl-substituted PAHs to
contribute to the mid-infrared emission spectra and find that their specific
features do not match with the mid-infrared aromatic emission bands.

thermodynamic properties of the engine and implement the optimisations. The
caloric properties of the working fluids are obtained by using an 8th-order

the following criteria: (1.) energy efficiency, (2.) exergy efficiency, and
(3.) combination of both of them. The results suggest that the design of

balance missed detections and false alarms in his objective function, while the
spy has a tradeoff between attacking the file server more aggressively and
increasing the chances of getting caught. We give a characterization of the
Nash equilibria in mixed strategies, and demonstrate how the Nash equilibria
can be computed in polynomial time. Our characterization gives interesting and

  Communications","37 pages,9 figures,37 references",,,,"cs.DC cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The term Autonomic Communication (AC) refers to self-managing systems which
are capable of supporting self-configuration, self-healing and
self-optimization. However, information reflection and collection, lack of
centralized control, non-cooperation and so on are just some of the challenges
within AC systems. We have considered these problems in theory and practice and
reached the following conclusion; in order to build an ideal system for
autonomic communication, there are three key problems to be solved. Motivated
by the need for AC, we have designed an efficient and low-cost Peer-to-Peer
(P2P) overlay called Maya-Pyramid overlay (MPO) and combined merits of
unstructured P2P with those of structured P2P overlays. Differing from the
traditional hierarchical P2P (i.e. tree-like structure) overlay, (1) MPO is
composed of levels and layers, which uses small world characteristic to improve
efficiency, and the maintenance cost is decreased because update and backup
only take place in two neighboring levels or layers instead of recursively
perform in higher levels. (2) Unlike normal redundant mechanisms for solving
the single fault problem: Tri-Information Center (Tri-IC) mechanism is
presented in order to improve robustness by alleviating the load of cluster
heads in a hierarchical P2P overlay. (3) A source ranking mechanism is proposed
in order to discourage free riding and whitewashing and to encourage frequent
information exchanges between peers. (4) Inspired by Pastry's ID structure for
a structured DHT algorithm, a 3D unique ID structure is presented in the
unstructured P2P overlay. This will guarantee anonymity in routing, and will
be, not only more efficient because it applies the DHT-like routing algorithm
in the unstructured P2P overlay, but also more adaptive to suit AC. Evaluation
proved that MPO is robust, highly efficient and of a low-cost.

collisional/accretional/dynamical evolution of a large number of km-sized

it as the 'Lagrangian Integrator for Planetary Accretion and Dynamics' or
LIPAD. LIPAD is built on top of SyMBA, which is a symplectic $N$-body
integrator. In order to handle the very large number of planetesimals required
by planet formation simulations, we introduce the concept of a `tracer'
particle. Each tracer is intended to represent a large number of disk particles
on roughly the same orbit and size as one another, and is characterized by
three numbers: the physical radius, the bulk density, and the total mass of the
disk particles represented by the tracer. We developed statistical algorithms
that follow the dynamical and collisional evolution of the tracers due to the
presence of one another. The tracers mainly dynamically interact with the
larger objects (`planetary embryos') in the normal N-body way. LIPAD's greatest
strength is that it can accurately model the wholesale redistribution of
planetesimals due to gravitational interaction with the embryos, which has
recently been shown to significantly affect the growth rate of planetary
embryos . We verify the code via a comprehensive set of tests which compare our
results with those of Eulerian and/or direct N-body codes.

divergence. When the scene is illuminated by coherent radiation, image data is
corrupted by speckle noise, as is the case of ultrasound-B, sonar, laser and
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. In the amplitude and intensity formats,
this noise is multiplicative and non-Gaussian requiring, thus, specialized
techniques for image processing and understanding. One of the most successful
family of models for describing these images is the Multiplicative Model which
leads, among other probability distributions, to the G0 law. This distribution
has been validated in the literature as an expressive and tractable model,
deserving the ""universal"" denomination for its ability to describe most types
of targets. In order to compute the statistical complexity of a site in an

is that of fully developed speckle, namely the Gamma law in intensity format,
which appears in areas with little or no texture. We use the Shannon entropy

Poincar\'e. In this paper I present a personal and scientific biographical
sketch of Poincar\'e, which does not in any way reflect Poincar\'e's rich
personality and immense activity in science: When Poincar\'e traveled to parts
of Europe, Africa and America, his companions noticed that he knew well
everything from statistics to history and curious customs and habits of
peoples. He was almost teaching everything in science. He was so encyclopedic
that he dealt with the outstanding questions in the different branches of
physics and mathematics; he had altered whole fields of science such as
non-Euclidean geometry, Arithmetic, celestial mechanics, thermodynamics and
kinetic theory, optics, electrodynamics, Maxwell's theory, and other topics
from the forefront of Fin de Si\`ecle physical science. It is interesting to
note that as opposed to the prosperity of biographies and secondary papers
studying the life and scientific contributions of Albert Einstein, one finds
much less biographies and secondary sources discussing Poincar\'e's life and
work. As opposed to Einstein, Poincar\'e was not a cultural icon. Beginning in
1920 Einstein became a myth and a world famous figure. Although Poincar\'e was
so brilliant in mathematics, he mainly remained a famous mathematician within
the professional circle of scientists. He published more papers than Einstein,
performed research in many more branches of physics and mathematics, received
more prizes on his studies, and was a member of more academies in the whole
world. Despite this tremendous yield, Poincar\'e did not win the Nobel Prize.

effect may be accounted for by enhanced $1/m_c$ corrections in a CP-violating

$V^*_{cb}V_{ub}$. A consistent scheme based on broken flavor SU(3) is presented
relating Cabibbo-favored (CF) and singly-Cabibbo-suppressed (SCS) $D$ meson
decay rates into two pseudoscalars. Two important ingredients supporting the
above interpretation for $\Delta A_{CP}$ are a large exchange amplitude in CF
decays which is formally $1/m_c$-suppressed, and a pure $\Delta U=0$ U-spin
breaking CP-conserving penguin amplitude involving $V^*_{cs}V_{us}$ and
$V^*_{cd}V_{ud}$ which accounts for the difference between the $D^0\to K^+K^-$

violating penguin amplitudes, where the former involves U-spin breaking at a
level of 10%, are shown to be related to each other by the magnitudes of
corresponding CKM factors. This simple scheme leads to preferable sign

optoelectronic applications. BaSnO3 is a semiconducting oxide with a large band
gap of more than 3.1 eV. Recently, we discovered that La doped BaSnO3 exhibits
unusually high electrical mobility of 320 cm^2(Vs)^-1 at room temperature and
superior thermal stability at high temperatures [H. J. Kim et al. Appl. Phys.
Express. 5, 061102 (2012)]. Following that work, we report various physical
properties of (Ba,La)SnO3 single crystals and films including
temperature-dependent transport and phonon properties, optical properties and
first-principles calculations. We find that almost doping-independent mobility
of 200-300 cm^2(Vs)^-1 is realized in the single crystals in a broad doping
range from 1.0x10^19 to 4.0x10^20 cm^-3. Moreover, the conductivity of ~10^4
ohm^-1cm^-1 reached at the latter carrier density is comparable to the highest
value. We attribute the high mobility to several physical properties of
(Ba,La)SnO3: a small effective mass coming from the ideal Sn-O-Sn bonding,
small disorder effects due to the doping away from the SnO2 conduction channel,
and reduced carrier scattering due to the high dielectric constant. The
observation of a reduced mobility of ~70 cm^2(Vs)^-1 in the film is mainly
attributed to additional carrier-scatterings which are presumably created by
the lattice mismatch between the substrate SrTiO3 and (Ba,La)SnO3. The main
optical gap of (Ba,La)SnO3 single crystals remained at about 3.33 eV and the
in-gap states only slightly increased, thus maintaining optical transparency in
the visible region. Based on these, we suggest that the doped BaSnO3 system
holds great potential for realizing all perovskite-based, transparent
high-frequency high-power functional devices as well as highly mobile
two-dimensional electron gas via interface control of heterostructured films.

important source of information in remote sensing applications. The most
complete format this type of imaging produces consists of complex-valued
Hermitian matrices in every image coordinate and, as such, their visualization
is challenging. They also suffer from speckle noise which reduces the
signal-to-noise ratio. Smoothing techniques have been proposed in the
literature aiming at preserving different features and, analogously,
projections from the cone of Hermitian positive matrices to different color
representation spaces are used for enhancing certain characteristics. In this
work we propose the use of stochastic distances between models that describe
this type of data in a Nagao-Matsuyama-type of smoothing technique. The
resulting images are shown to present good visualization properties (noise
reduction with preservation of fine details) in all the considered

the dielectric properties can be used as an estimate of the degree of
anisotropy of the micro-structure of the trabecular tissue. Conductivity
appears to be the most sensitive parameter in this respect. Models with ellipse
shaped-inclusions are also tested to study their application to modelling bone

relatively good agreement when compared with realistic models of bone tissue.

The magnetic field present in the intra-cluster medium would lead to
conversions of VHE photons into axion-like particles (ALPs), which are a
generic prediction of several extensions of the Standard Model. ALPs produced
in this way would traverse cosmological distances unaffected by the
extragalactic background light at variance with VHE photons which undergo a
substantial absorption. Eventually, a nontrivial fraction of ALPs would
re-convert into VHE photons in the magnetic field of the Milky Way. This
mechanism produces a significant hardening of the VHE spectrum of AGN in galaxy
clusters. As a specific example we consider the energy spectra of two observed
VHE gamma-ray sources located in galaxy clusters, namely 1ES 0414+009 at
redshift z=0.287 and Mkn 501 at z=0.034. We find that the hardening in the

the broad line region in active galactic nuclei. We argue that the clouds may
be gravitationally bound to the supermassive black hole. If true, stabilisation
by thermal pressure alone becomes even more difficult. We further argue that if
magnetic fields should be present in such clouds at a level that could affect
the stability properties, they need to be strong enough to compete with the
radiation pressure on the cloud. This would imply magnetic field values of a
few Gauss for a sample of Active Galactic Nuclei we draw from the literature.
We then investigate the effect of several magnetic configurations on cloud
stability in axi-symmetric magnetohydrodynamic simulations. For a purely
azimuthal magnetic field which provides the dominant pressure support, the
cloud first gets compressed by the opposing radiative and gravitational forces.
The pressure inside the cloud then increases, and it expands vertically.
Kelvin-Helmholtz and column density instability lead to a filamentary
fragmentation of the cloud. This radiative dispersion continues until the cloud
is shredded down to the resolution level. For a helical magnetic field
configuration, a much more stable cloud core survives with a stationary density
histogram which takes the form of a power law. Our simulated clouds develop
sub-Alfvenic internal motions on the level of a few hundred km/s.

points associated with a change of the Fermi surface topology at zero
temperature. In the overdoped region, the Fermi surface is complete and
electron-like; across the Lifshitz transition, the Fermi surface becomes
hole-like and develops a pseudogap. At (or very close to) the Lifshitz
transition points, a van Hove singularity in the density of states crosses the
Fermi level. The van Hove singularity occurs at finite doping due to
correlation effects, and becomes more singular when $t'$ becomes more negative.
The resulting temperature dependence on the bare d-wave pairing susceptibility
close to the Lifshitz points is significantly different from that found in the
traditional van Hove scenarios. Such unambiguous numerical observation of the

production from gluon fusion and decay to two photons within ""minimal"" UED
(mUED), independently confirming previous results, and we have evaluated
enhancement factors for Higgs boson production and decay over the mUED
parameter space. Using these we have derived limits on the parameter space,
combining data from both ATLAS and CMS collaborations for the most recent 7 TeV
and 8 TeV LHC data. We have performed a rigorous statistical combination of
several Higgs boson search channels which is important because mUED signatures
from the Higgs boson are not universally enhanced.
  We have found that 1/R < 500 GeV is excluded at 95% CL, while for larger 1/R
only a very narrow (\pm1-4 GeV) mass window around m_h = 125 GeV and another
window (up to 2 GeV wide for 1/R > 1000 GeV) around m_h = 118 GeV are left. The
latter is likely to be excluded as more data becomes available whereas the
region around 125 GeV is where the recently discovered Higgs-like particle was
observed and therefore where the exclusion limit is weaker.
  It is worth stressing that mUED predicts an enhancement for all channels for
Higgs production by gluon fusion and decay while the vector boson fusion
process WW/ZZ -> h -> AA is generically suppressed and WW/ZZ -> h -> WW*/ZZ* is
standard. Therefore, as more 8 TeV LHC data becomes available, the information
on individual Higgs boson production and decay processes provided by the CMS
and ATLAS experiments can be effectively used to favour mUED or exclude it
further.

observed extreme galaxy cluster? Usually, the word extreme refers directly to
cluster mass, which is not a direct observable and thus subject to substantial
uncertainty. Hence, it is desirable to extend studies of extreme clusters to
direct observables, such as the Einstein radius (ER). We aim to evaluate the
occurrence probability of the large observed ER of MACS J0717.5 within the
standard LCDM cosmology. In particular, we want to model the distribution
function of the single largest ER in a given cosmological volume and to study
which underlying assumptions and effects have the strongest impact on the
results. We obtain this distribution by a Monte Carlo approach, based on the
semi-analytic modelling of the halo population on the past lightcone. After
sampling the distribution, we fit the results with the general extreme value
(GEV) distribution which we use for the subsequent analysis. We find that the
distribution of the maximum ER is particularly sensitive to the precise choice
of the halo mass function, lens triaxiality, the inner slope of the halo
density profile and the mass-concentration relation. Using the distributions so
obtained,we study the occurrence probability of the large ER of MACS J0717.5,
finding that this system is not in tension with LCDM. We also find that the GEV
distribution can be used to fit very accurately the sampled distributions and
that all of them can be described by a Frechet distribution. With a multitude
of effects that strongly influence the distribution of the single largest ER,
it is more than doubtful that the standard LCDM cosmology can be ruled out on
the basis of a single observation. If, despite the large uncertainties in the
underlying assumptions, one wanted to do so, a much larger ER (> 100 arcsec)
than that of MACS J0717.5 would have to be observed.

3-folds, their mirror configurations of D6-branes, cluster integrable systems
in (0+1) dimensions and leading singularities in scattering amplitudes for N=4

relevant for scattering amplitudes. We investigate the BFT perspective on graph
modifications, the emergence of Calabi-Yau manifolds (which arise as the master
and moduli spaces of BFTs), the translation between square moves in the graph
and Seiberg duality and the identification of dual theories by means of the
underlying Calabi-Yaus, the phenomenon of loop reduction and the interpretation
of the boundary operator for cells in the positive Grassmannian as higgsing in
the BFT. We develop a technique based on generalized Kasteleyn matrices that
permits an efficient determination of the Calabi-Yau geometries associated to
arbitrary graphs. Our techniques allow us to go beyond the planar limit by both
increasing the number of boundaries of the graphs and the genus of the

magnitude, enabling images of rapidly rotating stars with structures in their
circumstellar disks and winds, or mapping out patterns of nonradial pulsations
across stellar surfaces. Intensity interferometry (pioneered by Hanbury Brown
and Twiss) connects telescopes only electronically, and is practically
insensitive to atmospheric turbulence and optical imperfections, permitting
observations over long baselines and through large airmasses, also at short
optical wavelengths. The required large telescopes with very fast detectors are
becoming available as arrays of air Cherenkov telescopes, distributed over a
few square km. Digital signal handling enables very many baselines to be
synthesized, while stars are tracked with electronic time delays, thus
synthesizing an optical interferometer in software. Simulated observations
indicate limiting magnitudes around m(v)=8, reaching resolutions ~30
microarcsec in the violet. The signal-to-noise ratio favors high-temperature
sources and emission-line structures, and is independent of the optical
passband, be it a single spectral line or the broad spectral continuum.
Intensity interferometry provides the modulus (but not phase) of any spatial
frequency component of the source image; for this reason image reconstruction
requires phase retrieval techniques, feasible if sufficient coverage of the
interferometric (u,v)-plane is available. Experiments are in progress; test
telescopes have been erected, and trials in connecting large Cherenkov
telescopes have been carried out. This paper reviews this interferometric
method in view of the new possibilities offered by arrays of air Cherenkov
telescopes, and outlines observational programs that should become realistic
already in the rather near future.

a parameter space. We perform a number of supersymmetric parameter scans with
IceCube data to illustrate the utility of the method: example global fits and a
signal recovery in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model
(CMSSM), and a model exclusion exercise in a 7-parameter phenomenological
version of the MSSM. The final IceCube detector configuration will probe almost
the entire focus-point region of the CMSSM, as well as a number of MSSM-7
models that will not otherwise be accessible to e.g. direct detection. Our
method accurately recovers the mock signal, and provides tight constraints on
model parameters and derived quantities. We show that the inclusion of spectral
information significantly improves the accuracy of the recovery, providing
motivation for its use in future IceCube analyses.

polarized quarks allowed the study of the Collins fragmentation function. Both
favored and unfavored Collins fragmentation functions were generated, the
latter purely by multiple hadron emissions, with 1/2 moments of opposite sign
in the region of the light-cone momentum fraction $z$ accessible in current
experiments. Hints of such behavior has been seen in the measurements in
several experiments. Also, in the transverse momentum dependent (TMD) hadron
emission probabilities, modulations of up to fourth order in sine of the polar
angle were observed, while the Collins effect describes just the linear
modulations. A crucial part of the extended model was the calculation of the
quark spin flip probability after each hadron emission in the jet. Here we
study the effects of this probability on the resulting unfavored and favored
Collins functions by setting it as a constant and use a toy model for the
elementary single hadron emission probabilities. The results of the Monte Carlo
simulations showed that preferential quark spin flip in the elementary hadron
emission is needed to generate the favored and unfavored Collins functions with
opposite sign 1/2 moments. For the TMD hadron emission modulations, we showed
that the model quark spin flip probabilities are a partial source of the higher
rode modulations, while the other source is the Collins modulation of the
remnant quark from the hadron emission recoil.

around the active, secondary black hole, by the tidal field of the primary. In
Paper I by Montuori et al. (2011), we focussed on broad lines emitted by gas
bound to the lighter accreting member of a binary when the binary is at the
center of a hollow density region (the gap) inside a circum-binary disc. The
main aim of this new study is at exploring the potential contribution to the
broad line emission by the circum-binary disc and by gaseous streams flowing
toward the black hole through the gap. We carry out a post-process analysis of
data extracted from a SPH simulation of a circum-binary disc around a black
hole binary. Our main result is that the MgII to CIV flux ratio can be reduced
to ~ 0.1 within an interval of sub-pc binary separations of the order of a ~
(0.01-0.2)(f_Edd/0.1)^(1/2) pc corresponding to orbital periods of ~ (20-200)

returns to increase to values that are indistinguishable from the case of a
single AGN (typically F_MgII/F_CIV ~ 0.3-0.4) because of the contribution to

function of the matter fields localization. We show that truncation to zero
modes is inconsistent and the tree-level exchange of the massive gravitational
multiplet is needed for consistency of the four-dimensional theory. In addition
to the standard Kahler coming from dimensional reduction, we find the quartic
correction coming from integrating out the gravity multiplet. We apply our
result to the computation of scalar masses, by assuming that the SUSY breaking
field is a bulk hypermultiplet. In the limit of extreme opposite localization
of the matter and the spurion fields, we find zero scalar masses, consistent
with sequestering arguments. Surprisingly enough, for all the other cases the
scalar masses are tachyonic. This suggests the holographic interpretation that
a CFT sector always generates operators contributing in a tachyonic way to
scalar masses. Viability of warped su- persymmetric compactifications
necessarily asks then for additional contributions. We discuss the case of
additional bulk vector multiplets with mixed boundary conditions, which is a
partic- ularly simple and attractive way to generate large positive scalar
masses. We show that in this case successful fermion mass matrices implies
highly degenerate scalar masses for the first two generations of squarks and

with respect to a reference density, such as the critical density or the mean
matter density of the Universe. Such definitions can lead to a spurious
pseudo-evolution of halo mass simply due to redshift evolution of the reference
density, even if its physical density profile remains constant over time. We
estimate the amount of such pseudo-evolution of mass between z=1 to 0 for halos
identified in a large N-body simulation, and show that it accounts for almost
the entire mass evolution of the majority of halos with M200 of about 1E12
solar masses and can be a significant fraction of the apparent mass growth even
for cluster-sized halos. We estimate the magnitude of the pseudo-evolution
assuming that halo density profiles remain static in physical coordinates, and
show that this simple model predicts the pseudo-evolution of halos identified
in numerical simulations to good accuracy, albeit with significant scatter. We
discuss the impact of pseudo-evolution on the evolution of the halo mass
function and show that the non-evolution of the low-mass end of the halo mass
function is the result of a fortuitous cancellation between pseudo-evolution
and the absorption of small halos into larger hosts. We also show that the
evolution of the low mass end of the concentration-mass relation observed in
simulations is almost entirely due to the pseudo-evolution of mass. Finally, we
discuss the implications of our results for the interpretation of the evolution
of various scaling relations between the observable properties of galaxies and
galaxy clusters and their halo masses.

resonant substructure of the three-body decay D0 to Ks pi+ pi- using CDF II

from D*+(2010) to D0 pi+ and D*-(2010) to D0bar pi-, where the production

We apply a Dalitz-amplitude analysis for the description of the dynamic decay

employing the isobar model for the contributing resonances and a
model-independent bin-by-bin comparison of the D0 and D0bar Dalitz plots. We
find no CP-violation effects and measure an asymmetry of ACP = (-0.05 +- 0.57

125 GeV Higgs. This channel proves to be very promising for both the discovery
of top partners and a test of the Higgs sector. For a reference value
$\lambda_{\tilde{T}}=3$ of the Higgs coupling to the top partner, we could have
a discovery (observation) at the 8 TeV LHC, with 30 fb$^{-1}$, for top partner

nearby, bright Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 509. The study is part of an extensive
XMM-Newton monitoring consisting of 10 pointings (~60 ks each) about once every
four days, and includes also a reanalysis of previous XMM-Newton and Chandra
observations. Mrk 509 shows a clear (EW=58 eV) neutral Fe Kalpha emission line
that can be decomposed into a narrow (sigma=0.027 keV) component (found in the
Chandra HETG data) plus a resolved (sigma=0.22 keV) component. We find the
first successful measurement of a linear correlation between the intensity of
the resolved line component and the 3-10 keV flux variations on time-scales of
years down to a few days. The Fe Kalpha reverberates the hard X-ray continuum
without any measurable lag, suggesting that the region producing the resolved
Fe Kalpha component is located within a few light days-week (r<~10^3 rg) from
the Black Hole (BH). The lack of a redshifted wing in the line poses a lower
limit of >40 rg for its distance from the BH. The Fe Kalpha could thus be
emitted from the inner regions of the BLR, i.e. within the ~80 light days
indicated by the Hbeta line measurements. In addition to these two neutral Fe
Kalpha components, we confirm the detection of weak (EW~8-20 eV) ionised Fe K
emission. This ionised line can be modeled with either a blend of two narrow
FeXXV and FeXXVI emission lines or with a single relativistic line produced, in
an ionised disc, down to a few rg from the BH. Finally, we observe a
weakening/disappearing of the medium and high velocity high ionisation Fe K
wind features found in previous XMM-Newton observations. This campaign has made
possible the first reverberation measurement of the resolved component of the
Fe Kalpha line, from which we can infer a location for the bulk of its emission
at a distance of r~40-1000 rg from the BH.

self-organized collective motions that help the group to effectively solve the
problem of coordination. However, it is still not known exactly how humans
adjust their behavior locally, nor what are the direct consequences on the
emergent organization. One of the underlying mechanisms of adjusting individual
motions is the stepping dynamics. In this paper, we present first quantitative
analysis on the stepping behavior in a one-dimensional pedestrian flow studied
under controlled laboratory conditions. We find that the step length is
proportional to the velocity of the pedestrian, and is directly related to the
space available in front of him, while the variations of the step duration are
much smaller. This is in contrast with locomotion studies performed on isolated
pedestrians and shows that the local density has a direct influence on the
stepping characteristics. Furthermore, we study the phenomena of
synchronization -walking in lockstep- and show its dependence on flow
densities. We show that the synchronization of steps is particularly important
at high densities, which has direct impact on the studies of optimizing
pedestrians flow in congested situations. However, small synchronization and
antisynchronization effects are found also at very low densities, for which no
steric constraints exist between successive pedestrians, showing the natural
tendency to synchronize according to perceived visual signals.

  results of [CoRR, abs/1201.2780, 2012]",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A \emph{$t$-treewidth-modulator} of a graph $G$ is a set $X \subseteq V(G)$
such that the treewidth of $G-X$ is at most some constant $t-1$. In this paper,
we present a novel algorithm to compute a decomposition scheme for graphs $G$
that come equipped with a $t$-treewidth-modulator. This decomposition, called a
\emph{protrusion decomposition}, is the cornerstone in obtaining the following
two main results.
  We first show that any parameterized graph problem (with parameter $k$) that
has \emph{finite integer index} and is \emph{treewidth-bounding} admits a
linear kernel on $H$-topological-minor-free graphs, where $H$ is some arbitrary
but fixed graph. A parameterized graph problem is called treewidth-bounding if
all positive instances have a $t$-treewidth-modulator of size $O(k)$, for some
constant $t$. This result partially extends previous meta-theorems on the
existence of linear kernels on graphs of bounded genus [Bodlaender et al., FOCS
2009] and $H$-minor-free graphs [Fomin et al., SODA 2010].
  Our second application concerns the Planar-$\mathcal{F}$-Deletion problem.
Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a fixed finite family of graphs containing at least one
planar graph. Given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ and a non-negative integer $k$,
Planar-$\mathcal{F}$-Deletion asks whether $G$ has a set $X\subseteq V(G)$ such
that $|X|\leq k$ and $G-X$ is $H$-minor-free for every $H\in \mathcal{F}$. Very
recently, an algorithm for Planar-$\mathcal{F}$-Deletion with running time
$2^{O(k)} n \log^2 n$ (such an algorithm is called \emph{single-exponential})
has been presented in [Fomin et al., FOCS 2012] under the condition that every
graph in $\mathcal{F}$ is connected. Using our algorithm to construct
protrusion decompositions as a building block, we get rid of this connectivity
constraint and present an algorithm for the general
Planar-$\mathcal{F}$-Deletion problem running in time $2^{O(k)} n^2$.

searches performed on 1,000 'fuzzy-real' NEO orbit distribution models that we
developed for this purpose. The family-free 'fuzzy-real' NEO models maintain
both the micro and macro distribution of 5 orbital elements (ignoring the mean
anomaly). Three clusters were identified that contain four or more NEOs but
none of them are statistically significant at \geq 3{\sigma}. The most
statistically significant cluster at the \sim 2{\sigma} level contains 4
objects with H < 20 and all members have long observational arcs and
concomitant good orbital elements. Despite the low statistical significance we
performed several other tests on the cluster to determine if it is likely a
genetic family. The tests included examining the cluster's taxonomy,
size-frequency distribution, consistency with a family-forming event during
tidal disruption in a close approach to Mars, and whether it is detectable in a
proper element cluster search. None of these tests exclude the possibility that
the cluster is a family but neither do they confirm the hypothesis. We conclude
that we have not identified any NEO families.

disk-band form of F, has zero self-linking. We prove that such a K is slice in
a Z[1/2]-homology 4-ball if and only if J is as well, a stronger result than
what is currently known for genus one slice knots. As an application, we prove
that given knots K and J and any odd integer p, the (2, p) cables of K and J
are Z[1/2]-concordant if and only if K and J are Z[1/2]-concordant. In
particular, if the (2,1)-cable of a knot K is slice, K is slice in a
Z[1/2]-homology ball.

the phase space distribution function approach and apply it to the dark matter
redshift space power spectrum and its moments. RSD can be written as a sum over
density weighted velocity moments correlators, with the lowest order being
density, momentum density and stress energy density. We use standard and
extended perturbation theory (PT) to determine their auto and cross
correlators, comparing them to N-body simulations. We show which of the terms
can be modeled well with the standard PT and which need additional terms that
include higher order corrections which cannot be modeled in PT. Most of these
additional terms are related to the small scale velocity dispersion effects,
the so called finger of god (FoG) effects, which affect some, but not all, of
the terms in this expansion, and which can be approximately modeled using a
simple physically motivated ansatz such as the halo model. We point out that
there are several velocity dispersions that enter into the detailed RSD
analysis with very different amplitudes, which can be approximately predicted
by the halo model. In contrast to previous models our approach systematically
includes all of the terms at a given order in PT and provides a physical
interpretation for the small scale dispersion values. We investigate RSD power
spectrum as a function of \mu, the cosine of the angle between the Fourier mode
and line of sight, focusing on the lowest order powers of \mu and multipole
moments which dominate the observable RSD power spectrum. Overall we find
considerable success in modeling many, but not all, of the terms in this
expansion.

thermodynamics and gravity which leads to an emergent phenomenon for the origin
of gravity and general relativity. In this paper, we investigate some features
of this model in the presence of noncommutative charged black hole by
performing the method of coordinate coherent states representing smeared
structures. We derive several quantities, e.g. temperature, energy and entropic
force. Our approach clearly exhibits that the entropic force on a smallest
fundamental cell of holographic surface with radius $r_0$ is halted.
Accordingly, we can conclude that the black hole remnants are absolutely inert
without gravitational interactions. So, the equivalence principle of general
relativity is contravened due to the fact that it is now possible to find a
difference between the gravitational and inertial mass. In other words, the
gravitational mass in the remnant size does not emit any gravitational field,
therefore it is experienced to be zero, contrary to the inertial mass. This
phenomenon illustrates a good example for a feasible experimental confirmation
to the entropic picture of Newton's Second law in very short distances.

wave field is used for micro-objects manipulation, a technique termed as

to confine sound waves inside the droplets. Two techniques were developed for
precise control of droplet shapes: edge pinning and hydrophilic/hydrophobic
interface pinning. For all tested droplet shapes, including circular, annular

manipulated by ultrasound and form into a variety of patterns, for example,
concentric rings and radial lines in an annular droplet. The complexity of the
pattern increases with increasing frequency, and the observations are in line
with simulation results. The acoustic manipulation technique developed here has
the potential to be integrated into a more complex on-chip microfluidic
circuit. Especially because our method is well compatible with electrowetting
technology, which is a powerful tool for manipulating droplets with free
surfaces, the combination of the two methods can provide more versatile

all cellular sets (X). This implies in particular that a cellular set (S) is
local with respect to the set of spine inclusions if and only if it is
Cartesian-local. However, we show that the minimal localizer containing the
spine inclusions is not stable under two-point suspension, which implies that
the equivalences between objects fibrant for this model structure only depend
on their height-(0) and height-(1) structure. We then try to see if adopting an
approach similar to Rezk's, namely looking at all of the suspensions of the
inclusion of a point into a freestanding isomorphism. We call the fibrant
objects for this model structure \dfn{isostable Joyal-fibrant} cellular sets.
We understand the resulting model structure to be conjectured by a few
mathematicians to give a model structure for a category of weak
(\omega)-categories. However, we make short work of this claim by producing an
explicit example of a nontrivial contractible cofibrant strict
(\omega)-category (with respect to the folk model structure) and showing that
it is, first, not trivially fibrant, and second, proving that it is fibrant
with respect to the isomorphism-stable Joyal model structure. We then speculate
on a few of the possible ways to construct a localizer that does actually have
our desired properties, leaving this question open for a future revision.

radius $R$ and thickness $t$ induced by a granular discharge. We measure the
critical filling height for which the structure fails upon discharge. We
observe that the silos sustain filling heights significantly above an
estimation obtained by coupling standard shell-buckling and granular stress
distribution theories. Two effects contribute to stabilize the structure: (i)
below the critical filling height, a dynamical stabilization due to granular
wall friction prevents the localized shell-buckling modes to grow irreversibly;
(ii) above the critical filling height, collapse occurs before the downward
sliding motion of the whole granular column sets in, such that only a partial
friction mobilization is at play. However, we notice also that the critical
filling height is reduced as the grain size, $d$, increases. The importance of
grain size contribution is controlled by the ratio $d/\sqrt{R t}$. We
rationalize these antagonist effects with a novel fluid/structure theory both
accounting for the actual status of granular friction at the wall and the
inherent shell imperfections mediated by the grains. This theory yields new
scaling predictions which are compared with the experimental results.

Lieb-Robinson bound is contained within a light cone. Signal fronts can be
studied unperturbed and with high precision for much longer times than on
finite systems. Entanglement inside the window is naturally small, greatly
lowering computational effort. We investigate the time evolution of the
transverse field Ising (TFI) model and of the S=1/2 XXZ antiferromagnet in
their symmetry broken phases after several different local quantum quenches.
  In both models, we observe distinct magnetization plateaus at the signal
front for very large times, resembling those previously observed for the
particle density of tight binding (TB) fermions. We show that the normalized
difference to the magnetization of the ground state exhibits similar scaling
behaviour as the density of TB fermions. In the XXZ model there is an
additional internal structure of the signal front due to pairing, and wider
plateaus with tight binding scaling exponents for the normalized excess
magnetization. We also observe parameter dependent interaction effects between
individual plateaus, resulting in a slight spatial compression of the plateau
widths.
  In the TFI model, we additionally find that for an initial Jordan-Wigner
domain wall state, the complete time evolution of the normalized excess
longitudinal magnetization agrees exactly with the particle density of TB
fermions.

games. Such games are a commonly used model in many formal methods, as they
make the interaction of a system with its environment explicit. Often, a
winning strategy for one of the players is used as a certificate or as an
artefact for further processing in the application. Small such certificates,
i.e., strategies that can be written down very compactly, are typically
preferred. For safety games, we only need to consider positional strategies.
These map game positions of a player onto a move that is to be taken by the
player whenever the play enters that position. For representing positional
strategies compactly, a common goal is to minimize the number of positions for
which a winning player's move needs to be defined such that the game is still
won by the same player, without visiting a position with an undefined next
move. We call winning strategies in which the next move is defined for few of
the player's positions sparse.
  Unfortunately, even roughly approximating the density of the sparsest
strategy for a safety game has been shown to be NP-hard. Thus, to obtain sparse
strategies in practice, one either has to apply some heuristics, or use some
exhaustive search technique, like ILP (integer linear programming) solving. In
this paper, we perform a comparative study of currently available methods to
obtain sparse winning strategies for the safety player in safety games. We
consider techniques from common knowledge, such as using ILP or SAT
(satisfiability) solving, and a novel technique based on iterative linear
programming. The results of this paper tell us if current techniques are
already scalable enough for practical use.

In a localized asymptotic approximation, related to the shearing sheet except
that the inhomogeneities occur in space rather than in time, we derive the
linearized perturbation equations for a razor-thin disk with turbulent

from the modal quantum numbers, the individual normal modes of the system

the profile of intrinsic rotation. In this article, the momentum deposition by
the lower hybrid wave on the electrons is studied. Due to the increase in the
poloidal momentum of the wave as it propagates into the tokamak, the parallel
momentum of the wave increases considerably. The change of the perpendicular
momentum of the wave is such that the toroidal angular momentum of the wave is
conserved. If the perpendicular momentum transfer via electron Landau damping
is ignored, the transfer of the toroidal angular momentum to the plasma will be
larger than the injected toroidal angular momentum. A proper quasilinear
treatment proves that both perpendicular and parallel momentum are transferred
to the electrons. The toroidal angular momentum of the electrons is then
transferred to the ions via different mechanisms for the parallel and
perpendicular momentum. The perpendicular momentum is transferred to ions
through an outward radial electron pinch, while the parallel momentum is
transferred through collisions.

performed with J=1-0 lines of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO at the 13.7 m telescope
of Purple Mountain Observatory. The mean column densities of the Planck gas
clumps range from 0.5 to 9.5$\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, with an average value of
(2.9$\pm$1.9)$\times10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. While the mean excitation temperatures
of these clumps range from 7.4 to 21.1 K, with an average value of 12.1$\pm$3.0
K. The averaged three-dimensional velocity dispersion $\sigma_{3D}$ in these
molecular clumps is 0.66$\pm$0.24 km s$^{-1}$. Most of the clumps have
$\sigma_{NT}$ larger than or comparable with $\sigma_{Therm}$. The H$_{2}$
column density of the molecular clumps calculated from molecular lines
correlates with the aperture flux at 857 GHz of the dust emission. Through
analyzing the distributions of the physical parameters, we suggest turbulent
flows can shape the clump structure and dominate their density distribution in
large scale, but not affect in small scale due to the local fluctuations.
Eighty two dense cores are identified in the molecular clumps. The dense cores
have an averaged radius and LTE mass of 0.34$\pm$0.14 pc and 38$_{-30}^{+5}$
M$_{\sun}$, respectively. And structures of low column density cores are more
affected by turbulence, while those of high column density cores are more
concerned by other factors, especially by gravity. The correlation of the
velocity dispersion versus core size is very weak for the dense cores. The
dense cores are found most likely gravitationally bounded rather than pressure
confined. The relationship between $M_{vir}$ and $M_{LTE}$ can be well fitted
with a power law. The core mass function here is much more flatten than the
stellar initial mass function. The lognormal behavior of the core mass
distribution is most likely determined by the internal turbulence.

background stationary spacetime. We revisit the different notions of energy as
defined by different observers. As is well known, the existence of a time-like
isometry allows for the notion of total conserved energy to be well defined. We
use this well known quantity to show that a gravitational potential energy can
be consistently defined. As examples, we study the case of the exterior regions
of an asymptotically flat black hole and of the $\Lambda>0$ Schwarzschild de
Sitter case, where an asymptotic region is not available. We then consider the
situation in which the test particle is absorbed by the black hole, and analyze
the energetics in detail. In particular, we show that the notion of horizon
energy as defined by the isolated horizons formalism provides a satisfactory
notion of energy compatible with the particle's total conserved energy. With
these choices, there is a global conservation of energy. Finally, we comment on
a recent proposal to define energy of the black hole as seen by a nearby
observer at rest, for which this feature is lost.

red giant clump stars are split into two components along the line of sight. We
investigate this split using the three fields from the ARGOS survey that lie on
the minor axis at (l,b) = (0,-5), (0,-7.5), (0,-10) degrees. The separation is
evident for stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5 in the two higher-latitude fields, but not
in the field at b = -5 degrees. Stars with [Fe/H] < -0.5 do not show the split.
We compare the spatial distribution and kinematics of the clump stars with
predictions from an evolutionary N-body model of a bulge that grew from a disk
via bar-related instabilities. The density distribution of the peanut-shaped
model is depressed near its minor axis. This produces a bimodal distribution of
stars along the line of sight through the bulge near its minor axis, very much
as seen in our observations. The observed and modelled kinematics of the two
groups of stars are also similar. We conclude that the split red clump of the
bulge is probably a generic feature of boxy/peanut bulges that grew from disks,
and that the disk from which the bulge grew had relatively few stars with
[Fe/H] < -0.5

characterize the precise number of critical points of f in terms of the Betti

a refinement, in the case of compact manifolds, of the Rabinowitz Saddle Point
Theorem. Our approach, inspired in part by techniques of chain-level symplectic

operations on the Morse complex of f, which yields relationships between the

of the 21-cm atomic hydrogen (HI) line and three 18-cm lines of the OH molecule
will be carried out with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder

with unprecedented angular and velocity resolution, as well as molecular line
thermal emission, absorption, and maser lines. The area to be covered includes
the Galactic plane (|b|< 10deg) at all declinations south of delta = +40deg,
spanning longitudes 167deg through 360deg to 79deg at b=0deg, plus the entire
area of the Magellanic Stream and Clouds, a total of 13,020 square degrees. The
brightness temperature sensitivity will be very good, typically sigma_T ~ 1 K
at resolution 30arcsec and 1 km/s. The survey has a wide spectrum of scientific
goals, from studies of galaxy evolution to star formation, with particular
contributions to understanding stellar wind kinematics, the thermal phases of
the interstellar medium, the interaction between gas in the disk and halo, and
the dynamical and thermal states of gas at various positions along the

  However, Elkin and Solomon's spanner construction is extremely complicated;
we offer a simple alternative construction that is very intuitive and is based
on the standard technique of net tree with cross edges. Indeed, our approach

for the better alternative is larger than the probability of voting for any
other. It follows from the law of large numbers that a plurality vote among the
n individuals would result in the correct outcome, with probability approaching
one exponentially quickly as n tends to infinity. Our interest in this paper is
in a variant of the process above where, after forming their initial opinions,
the voters update their decisions based on some interaction with their
neighbors in a social network. Our main example is ""majority dynamics"", in
which each voter adopts the most popular opinion among its friends. The
interaction repeats for some number of rounds and is then followed by a
population-wide plurality vote.
  The question we tackle is that of ""efficient aggregation of information"": in
which cases is the better alternative chosen with probability approaching one
as n tends to infinity? Conversely, for which sequences of growing graphs does
aggregation fail, so that the wrong alternative gets chosen with probability
bounded away from zero? We construct a family of examples in which interaction
prevents efficient aggregation of information, and give a condition on the
social network which ensures that aggregation occurs. For the case of majority
dynamics we also investigate the question of unanimity in the limit. In
particular, if the voters' social network is an expander graph, we show that if
the initial population is sufficiently biased towards a particular alternative
then that alternative will eventually become the unanimous preference of the
entire population.

domains can be found in numerous areas of science and engineering. A key
challenge in the formulation and implementation of corresponding coupled models
is to facilitate communication of information across physics, scale, and domain
interfaces, as well as between iterations of solvers used for response
computations. In a probabilistic context, any information that is to be
communicated between subproblems or iterations should be characterized by an
appropriate probabilistic representation. In this work, we consider stochastic
coupled problems whose subproblems involve only uncertainties that are
statistically independent of one another; for these problems, we present a
characterization of the exchanged information by using a reduced chaos
expansion with random coefficients. This expansion provides a
reduced-dimensional representation of the exchanged information, while
maintaining segregation between sources of uncertainty that stem from different
subproblems. Further, we present a measure transformation that allows
stochastic expansion methods to exploit this dimension reduction to obtain an
efficient solution of subproblems in a reduced-dimensional space. We show that
owing to the uncertainty source segregation, requisite orthonormal polynomials
and quadrature rules can be readily obtained by tensorization. Finally, the
proposed methodology is demonstrated by applying it to a multiphysics problem

which oxides formed during the hot rolling stage are removed from the surface
of the steel sheets. The efficiency of the pickling process is mainly dependent
on the nature of the oxide present at the surface of the steel, but, also, on
process parameters such as bath composition and time duration are relevant.
When acid concentration, solution temperatures and line speed are not properly
balanced, in fact, sheet defects like under pickling or over pickling may
happen and their occurrence does have a very serious effect on cold-reduction
performance and surface appearance of the finished product. Furthermore,
product damage from handling or improper equipment adjustment can render the
steel unsuitable for further processing. This is the reason why it is important
that process significant parameters are controlled and maintained as accurately
as possible in order to avoid these undesired phenomena. In the present work, a
control algorithm, composed by two different modules, i.e. decision tree and
rectangular Basis Function Network, has been implemented to aim of predicting
pickling defects and suggesting the optimal speed or the admissible speed range

mining. The important applications of the influence analysis in social network
include influence maximization for viral marketing, finding the most
influential nodes, online advertising, etc. For many of these applications, it
is crucial to evaluate the influenceability of a node. In this paper, we study
the problem of evaluating influenceability of nodes in social network based on
the widely used influence spread model, namely, the independent cascade model.
Since this problem is #P-complete, most existing work is based on Naive
Monte-Carlo (\nmc) sampling. However, the \nmc estimator typically results in a
large variance, which significantly reduces its effectiveness. To overcome this
problem, we propose two families of new estimators based on the idea of
stratified sampling. We first present two basic stratified sampling (\bss)
estimators, namely \bssi estimator and \bssii estimator, which partition the
entire population into $2^r$ and $r+1$ strata by choosing $r$ edges
respectively. Second, to further reduce the variance, we find that both \bssi
and \bssii estimators can be recursively performed on each stratum, thus we
propose two recursive stratified sampling (\rss) estimators, namely \rssi
estimator and \rssii estimator. Theoretically, all of our estimators are shown
to be unbiased and their variances are significantly smaller than the variance
of the \nmc estimator. Finally, our extensive experimental results on both
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of our new
estimators.

conductivity distribution inside a target is reconstructed based on voltage
measurements from the surface of the target. Reconstructing the conductivity
distribution is known to be an ill-posed inverse problem, the solutions of
which are highly intolerant to modelling errors. In order to achieve sufficient
accuracy, very dense meshes are usually needed in a finite element
approximation of the EIT forward model. This leads to very high-dimensional
problems and often unacceptably tedious computations for real-time
applications. In this paper, the model reduction in EIT is considered within
the Bayesian inversion framework. We construct the reduced-order model by
proper orthogonal decompositions (POD) of the electrical conductivity and the
potential distributions. The associated POD modes are computed based on a
priori information on the conductivity. The feasibility of the reduced-order
model is tested both numerically and with experimental data. In the selected
test cases, the proposed model reduction approach speeds up the computation by
more than two orders of magnitude in comparison with the conventional EIT
reconstruction, without decreasing the quality of the reconstructed images
significantly.

we study numerically how weak ties influence the predictability of epidemic
dynamics. We first investigate the effects of different kinds of weak ties on
the variabilities of both the arrival time and the prevalence of disease, and
find that the bridgeness with small degree can enhance the predictability of
epidemic spreading. Once weak ties are settled, compared with the variability
of arrival time, the variability of prevalence displays a diametrically opposed
changing trend with both the distance of the initial seed to the bridgeness and
the degree of the initial seed. More specifically, the further distance and the
larger degree of the initial seed can induce the better predictability of
arrival time and the worse predictability of prevalence. Moreover, we discuss
the effects of weak tie number on the epidemic variability. As community
strength becomes very strong, which is caused by the decrease of weak tie
number, the epidemic variability will change dramatically. Compared with the
case of hub seed and random seed, the bridgenss seed can result in the worst
predictability of arrival time and the best predictability of prevalence. These
results show that the variability of arrival time always marks a complete
reversal trend of that of prevalence, which implies it is impossible to predict
epidemic spreading in the early stage of outbreaks accurately.

union of cliques. The minimal clique number that can appear after a maximal

locations in a metric space, and a mechanism maps them to K facilities. Our
main result is an elegant characterization of deterministic strategyproof
mechanisms with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location on the
line. In particular, we show that for instances with n \geq 5 agents, any such
mechanism either admits a unique dictator, or always places the facilities at
the leftmost and the rightmost location of the instance. As a corollary, we
obtain that the best approximation ratio achievable by deterministic
strategyproof mechanisms for the problem of locating 2 facilities on the line
to minimize the total connection cost is precisely n-2. Another rather
surprising consequence is that the Two-Extremes mechanism of (Procaccia and
Tennenholtz, EC 2009) is the only deterministic anonymous strategyproof
mechanism with a bounded approximation ratio for 2-Facility Location on the

  The proof of the characterization employs several new ideas and technical
tools, which provide new insights into the behavior of deterministic
strategyproof mechanisms for K-Facility Location games, and may be of
independent interest. Employing one of these tools, we show that for every K
\geq 3, there do not exist any deterministic anonymous strategyproof mechanisms

for simple instances with K+1 agents. Moreover, building on the
characterization for the line, we show that there do not exist any

2-Facility Location on more general metric spaces, which is true even for

The glassy character of the lowest temperature, Tg=10 K, transition is further
confirmed by AC-susceptibility measurements, showing a characteristic frequency

M, including every well-founded model, is isomorphic to a submodel of its own

is elementary for quantifier-free assertions. The proof uses universal digraph
combinatorics, including an acyclic version of the countable random digraph,
which I call the countable random Q-graded digraph, and higher analogues
arising as uncountable Fraisse limits, leading to the hypnagogic digraph, a
set-homogeneous, class-universal, surreal-numbers-graded acyclic class digraph,
closely connected with the surreal numbers. The proof shows that $L^M$ contains
a submodel that is a universal acyclic digraph of rank $Ord^M$. The method of
proof also establishes that the countable models of set theory are linearly
pre-ordered by embeddability: for any two countable models of set theory, one
of them is isomorphic to a submodel of the other. Indeed, they are
pre-well-ordered by embedability in order-type exactly $\omega_1+1$.
Specifically, the countable well-founded models are ordered by embeddability in
accordance with the heights of their ordinals; every shorter model embeds into
every taller model; every model of set theory $M$ is universal for all
countable well-founded binary relations of rank at most $Ord^M$; and every
ill-founded model of set theory is universal for all countable acyclic binary
relations. Finally, strengthening a classical theorem of Ressayre, the same
proof method shows that if $M$ is any nonstandard model of PA, then every
countable model of set theory---in particular, every model of ZFC---is
isomorphic to a submodel of the hereditarily finite sets $HF^M$ of $M$. Indeed,
$HF^M$ is universal for all countable acyclic binary relations.

for arbitrarily long paths using only three colours. A recent generalization of
this concept implies that we may obtain such colourings even if we are forced
to choose edge colours from any sequence of lists of size 4 (while sufficiency
of lists of size 3 remains an open problem). As an extension of these basic

presence of a massive cluster (MS1054-03) in the FIRES field, and of
significant large scale structure in the CDFS field, allows us to study the
environmental dependence of SFRs amongst this population of low-mass galaxies.
Comparing our results with more massive galaxies at this epoch, with our
previous survey (ROLES) at the higher redshift z=1, and with SDSS Stripe 82
data, we find no significant evolution of the stellar mass function of
star-forming galaxies between z=0 and z=1, and no evidence that its shape
depends on environment. The correlation between specific star formation rate
(sSFR) and stellar mass at z=0.75 has a power-law slope of beta=-0.2, with
evidence for a steeper relation at the lowest masses. The normalization of this
correlation lies as expected between that corresponding to z=1 and the present
day. The global SFR density is consistent with an evolution of the form (1+z)^2
over 0<z<1, with no evidence for a dependence on stellar mass. The sSFR of
these star-forming galaxies at z=0.75 does not depend upon the density of their
local environment. Considering just high-density environments, the low-mass end
of the sSFR-M* relation in our data is steeper than that in Stripe 82 at z=0,
and shallower than that measured by ROLES at z=1. Evolution of low-mass
galaxies in dense environments appears to be more rapid than in the general

for the Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST). It is an echelle
spectrograph designed to measure three different regions of the solar spectrum
in three separate focal planes simultaneously between 380 and 900 nm. It will
use the polarimetric capabilities of the ATST to measure the full Stokes
parameters across the line profiles. By measuring the polarization in
magnetically sensitive spectral lines the magnetic field vector as a function
of height in the solar atmosphere can be obtained, along with the associated
variation of the thermodynamic properties. The ViSP will have a spatial
resolution of 0.04 arcsec over a 2 arcmin field of view (at 600 nm). The
minimum spectral resolving power for all the focal planes is 180,000. The
spectrograph supports up to 4 diffraction gratings and is fully automated to
allow for rapid reconfiguration.

matrix $A \in Z^{m \times n}$, compute an explicit formula parameterized by $b
\in R^m$ that determines the number of integer points in the polyhedron $\{x
\in R^n : Ax \leq b\}$. In the last decade, this counting problem has received
considerable attention in the literature. Several variants of Barvinok's
algorithm have been shown to solve this problem in polynomial time if the
number $n$ of columns of $A$ is fixed.
  Central to our investigation is the following question: Can one also
efficiently determine a parameter $b$ such that the number of integer points in
$\{x \in R^n : Ax \leq b\}$ is minimized? Here, the parameter $b$ can be chosen
from a given polyhedron $Q \subseteq R^m$.
  Our main result is a proof that finding such a minimizing parameter is
$NP$-hard, even in dimension 2 and even if the parametrization reflects a
translation of a 2-dimensional convex polygon. This result is established via a
relationship of this problem to arithmetic progressions and simultaneous
Diophantine approximation.
  On the positive side we show that in dimension 2 there exists a polynomial
time algorithm for each fixed $k$ that either determines a minimizing
translation or asserts that any translation contains at most $1 + 1/k$ times
the minimal number of lattice points.

$\approx 126$ GeV, which is compatible with the Higgs boson of the Standard
Model. A crucial question is, if for such a Higgs mass value, one could
extrapolate the model up to high scales while keeping the minimum of the scalar
potential that breaks the electroweak symmetry stable. Vacuum stability
requires indeed the Higgs boson mass to be $M_H \gsim 129 \pm 1$ GeV, but the
precise value depends critically on the input top quark pole mass which is
usually taken to be the one measured at the Tevatron, $m_t^{\rm exp}=173.2 \pm
0.9$ GeV. However, for an unambiguous and theoretically well-defined
determination of the top quark mass one should rather use the total cross
section for top quark pair production at hadron colliders. Confronting the
latest predictions of the inclusive $p \bar p \to t\bar t +X$ cross section up
to next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD to the experimental measurement at the
Tevatron, we determine the running mass in the $\bar{\rm MS}$-scheme to be
$m_t^{\bar{\rm MS}}(m_t) = 163.3 \pm 2.7$ GeV which gives a top quark pole mass
of $m_t^{\rm pole}= 173.3 \pm 2.8$ GeV. This leads to the vacuum stability
constraint $M_H \geq 129.8 \pm 5.6$ GeV to which a $\approx 126$ GeV Higgs
boson complies as the uncertainty is large. A very precise assessment of the
stability of the electroweak vacuum can only be made at a future high-energy
electron-positron collider, where the top quark pole mass could be determined
with a few hundred MeV accuracy.

extremely challenging to search the Drell-Yan stau pair at the LHC due to the
small production rate, we focus on the parameter space with enhanced production
of inclusive stau pairs, in particular, via $b\bar{b}$ fusion or gaugino pairs.
We study its phenomenology in both pure leptonic tau $\tau^\pm_\ell$ channels
and hadronic tau tagged $\tau_h$ channels. We find the same-sign dilepton from
$\tilde{\chi}^\pm_1 \tilde{\chi}^0_2 \to \tau^\pm_\ell \tau^\pm_\ell+X$ may
significantly improve the discovery potential with even 7--8 TeV LHC of ${\cal

most optimistic region of $M_2\sim 200-300$ GeV, it requires at least 50
fb$^{-1}$ data of 14 TeV LHC to reach a significance of 3.5 $\sigma$.
Therefore, we conclude it is difficult to claim discovery only through hadronic

We apply this equation to model the dose response for {\alpha}-particle

transfer (LET) radiations. When LET is high, the additional death rate is a
constant, which implies that the localized cells are damaged immediately and
the additional death rate is proportional to the number of cells present. While
at low LET, the additional death rate includes a constant term and a linear
term of radiation dose, implying that the damage to some cell nuclei has a time

not respected in a quantum theory of gravity, it has been difficult to
reconcile deviations from Lorentz-invariance with quantum field theory. The
most commonly used mechanisms either break Lorentz-invariance explicitly or
deform it at high energies. However, the former option is very tightly
constrained by experiment already, the latter generically leads to problems
with locality. We show here that there exists a third way to integrate
deviations from Lorentz-invariance into quantum field theory that circumvents
the problems of the other approaches. The way this is achieved is an extension
of the standard model in which photons can have different speeds without
singling out a preferred restframe, but only as long as they are in a quantum
superposition. Once a measurement has been made, observables are subject to the
laws of special relativity, and the process of measurement introduces a
preferred frame. The speed of light can take on different values, both
superluminal and subluminal (with respect to the usual value of the speed of
light), without the need for Lorentz-invariance violating operators and without
tachyons. We briefly discuss the relation to deformations of special relativity
and phenomenological consequences.

returns is independent it is shown that in the case without a riskless asset
the solution is presented as a sequence of optimal portfolio weights obtained
by solving the single-period Markowitz optimization problem. The process

proportional to the single-period solutions multiplied by time-varying

argument of x induced by partitioning occurring in the Lambda-Fleming-Viot
process. The eigenvalues and right polynomial eigenvectors are easy to see from
this representation. The two-dimensional process, which has a one-dimensional

Green's function. In a model with genic selection a proof is given that there
is a critical selection value such that if the selection coefficient is greater
or equal to the critical value then fixation, when the boundary 1 is hit, has
probability 1 beginning from any non-zero frequency. This is an analytic proof
different from proofs by Der, Epstein and Plotkin (2011) and Foucart (2013).
When fixation is not certain the fixation probability can be computed from an
algorithm in the paper. An application in the infinitely-many-alleles
Lambda-Fleming-Viot process is finding an interesting identity for the
frequency spectrum of alleles that is based on size-biassing. The moment dual
process in the Fleming-Viot process is the usual Lambda-coalescent tree back in
time. The Wright-Fisher representation using a different set of polynomials
g_n(x) as test functions produces a dual death process which has a similarity
to the Kingman coalescent and decreases by units of one. The eigenvalues of the
process are analogous to the Jacobi polynomials when expressed in terms of
g_n(x), playing the role of x^n. E[g_n(X)] under the stationary distribution
when there is mutation is analogous to the n th moment in a Beta distribution.
There is a version g_n(X), when X and n are d-dimensional, and even an

K0V star HD77338 as part of our on-going Calan-Hertfordshire Extrasolar Planet
Search. The best fit planet solution has an orbital period of 5.7361\pm0.0015
days and with a radial velocity semi-amplitude of only 5.96\pm1.74 m/s, we find
a minimum mass of 15.9+4.7-5.3 Me. The best fit eccentricity from this solution
is 0.09+0.25-0.09, and we find agreement for this data set using a Bayesian
analysis and a periodogram analysis. We measure a metallicity for the star of
+0.35\pm0.06 dex, whereas another recent work (Trevisan et al. 2011) finds
+0.47\pm0.05 dex. Thus HD77338b is one of the most metal-rich planet host stars
known and the most metal-rich star hosting a sub-Neptune mass planet. We
searched for a transit signature of HD77338b but none was detected. We also
highlight an emerging trend where metallicity and mass seem to correlate at
very low masses, a discovery that would be in agreement with the core accretion
model of planet formation. The trend appears to show that for Neptune-mass
planets and below, higher masses are preferred when the host star is more
metal-rich. Also a lower boundary is apparent in the super metal-rich regime
where there are no very low-mass planets yet discovered in comparison to the
sub-solar metallicity regime. A Monte Carlo analysis shows that this, low-mass
planet desert, is statistically significant with the current sample of 36
planets at around the 4.5\sigma\ level. In addition, results from Kepler
strengthen the claim for this paucity of the lowest-mass planets in super
metal-rich systems. Finally, this discovery adds to the growing population of
low-mass planets around low-mass and metal-rich stars and shows that very
low-mass planets can now be discovered with a relatively small number of data
points using stable instrumentation.

preferred sub-keV mass. In minimal gauge mediation without messenger-matter
mixing, realizing m_h = 125 GeV would require multi-TeV SUSY spectrum. The
increase in $m_h$ due to messenger-matter mixing is maximal in the case of
messengers belonging to 10+\bar{10} of SU(5) unification, while it is still
significant when they belong to $5+\bar{5}$ of SU(5). Our results are
compatible with gauge coupling unification, perturbativity, and the unification
of messenger Yukawa couplings. We embed these models into a grand unification
framework with a U(1) flavor symmetry that addresses the fermion mass hierarchy
and generates naturally large neutrino mixing angles. While SUSY mediated
flavor changing processes are sufficiently suppressed in such an embedding,
small new contributions to K^0-\bar{K^0} mixing can resolve the apparent

investigate how these observed splittings can constrain the modelling of the

We first compare models including a comprehensive treatment of shellular
rotation only, with the rotational splittings observed for the red giant KIC
8366239. We then study how these asteroseismic constraints can give us
information about the efficiency of an additional mechanism for the internal
transport of angular momentum. This is done by computing rotating models of KIC
8366239 that include a constant viscosity corresponding to this physical
process, in addition to the treatment of shellular rotation. Results: We find
that models of red giant stars including shellular rotation only predict steep
rotation profiles, which are incompatible with the measurements of rotational
splittings in the red giant KIC 8366239. Meridional circulation and shear
mixing alone are found to produce an insufficient internal coupling so that an
additional mechanism for the internal transport of angular momentum is needed
during the post-main sequence evolution. We show that the viscosity nu_add
corresponding to this mechanism is strongly constrained to be nu_add=3x10^4
cm^2 s^-1 thanks to the observed ratio of the splittings for modes in the wings
to those at the centre of the dipole forests. Such a value of viscosity may
suggest that the same unknown physical process is at work during the main
sequence and the post-main sequence evolution.

However, to date, there have been few reported attempts to employ advanced

three-dimensional (3D) OAT. In this work, we implement and investigate two
iterative image reconstruction methods for use with a 3D OAT small animal
imager: namely, a penalized least-squares (PLS) method employing a quadratic
smoothness penalty and a PLS method employing a total variation norm penalty.
The reconstruction algorithms employ accurate models of the ultrasonic
transducer impulse responses. Experimental data sets are employed to compare
the performances of the iterative reconstruction algorithms to that of a 3D
filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm. By use of quantitative measures of
image quality, we demonstrate that the iterative reconstruction algorithms can
mitigate image artifacts and preserve spatial resolution more effectively than
FBP algorithms. These features suggest that the use of advanced image
reconstruction algorithms can improve the effectiveness of 3D OAT while
reducing the amount of data required for biomedical applications.

DSBGK for simplicity) was proposed based on the BGK equation to reduce the
stochastic noise in simulating rarefied gas flows at low velocity, in which the
deviation from equilibrium state is small making the traditional DSMC
simulation time-consuming due to the dominance of noise in transient results.
In both DSMC and DSBGK simulations, the simulated molecules move into and out
of cells randomly and frequently. Consequently, the transient information of
molecules in each particular cell contains significant noise. The DSMC method
uses the transient values of molecular variables to compute the cell's
variables (including number density, flow velocity and temperature) and so the
stochastic noise in its cell's variables is remarkable particularly in the case
of low velocity. In the DSBGK simulation, the increments rather than the
transient information of molecular variables are used to update the cell's
variables based on the mass, momentum and energy conservation principles of
intermolecular collision process. This updating scheme significantly reduces
the noise in cell's variables of DSBGK simulations because the molecular
variables are updated smoothly by the extrapolation of acceptance-rejection
scheme and so their increments contain low noise. The detailed comparisons of
algorithms and results between the DSMC and DSBGK methods are given here.
Several benchmark problems are simulated to verify the DSBGK method by
comparison with the DSMC method as criterion.

shown that, in each domain of local parity symmetry of the potential, there
exists an invariant quantity in the form of a non-local current, in addition to
the globally invariant probability current. For symmetrically incoming states,
both invariant currents vanish if weak commutation of the total local parity
operator with the Hamiltonian is established, leading to local parity
eigenstates. For asymmetrically incoming states which resonate within locally
symmetric potential units, the complete local parity symmetry of the
probability density is shown to be necessary and sufficient for the occurrence
of perfect transmission. We connect the presence of local parity symmetries on
different spatial scales to the occurrence of multiple perfectly transmitting
resonances and propose a construction scheme for the design of resonant
transparent aperiodic potentials. Our findings are illustrated through
application to the analytically tractable case of piecewise constant

which the electronic nematic phases are perhaps the most surprising as they
spontaneously break rotational symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice. The
electron nematicity has been recently observed in the iron-pnictide and cuprate
high-temperature superconductors. Whether such a tendency of electrons to
self-organise unidirectionally has a common feature in these superconductors
is, however, a highly controversial issue. In the cuprates, the nematicity has
been suggested as a possible source of the pseudogap phase, whilst in the
iron-pnictides, it has been commonly associated with the
tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural phase transition at $T_s$. Here, we
provide the first thermodynamic evidence in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 that the nematicity
develops well above the structural transition and persists to the nonmagnetic
superconducting regime, resulting in a new phase diagram strikingly similar to
the pseudogap phase diagram in the cuprates. Our highly sensitive magnetic
anisotropy measurements using microcantilever torque-magnetometry under
in-plane field rotation reveal pronounced two-fold oscillations, which break
the tetragonal symmetry. Combined with complementary high-resolution
synchrotron X-ray and resistivity measurements, our results consistently
identify two distinct temperatures - one at $T^{\ast}$, signifying a true
nematic transition, and the other at $T_s (< T^{\ast})$, which we show to be
not a true phase transition, but rather what we refer to as a ""meta-nematic
transition"", in analogy to the well-known metamagnetic transition in the theory
of magnetism. Our observation of the extended nematic phase above the
superconducting dome establishes that the nematicity has primarily an
electronic origin, inherent in the normal state of high-temperature
superconductors.

protocol. In actual fact, about 90% of connections on the internet use TCP to
communicate. Through several upgrades and improvements, TCP became well
optimized for the very reliable wired networks. As a result, TCP considers all
packet timeouts in wired networks as due to network congestion and not to bit
errors. However, with networking becoming more heterogeneous, providing wired
as well as wireless topologies, TCP suffers from performance degradation over
error-prone wireless links as it has no mechanism to differentiate error losses
from congestion losses. It therefore considers all packet losses as due to
congestion and consequently reduces the burst of packet, diminishing at the
same time the network throughput. This paper proposes a new TCP congestion
control scheme appropriate for wireless as well as wired networks and is
capable of distinguishing congestion losses from error losses. The proposed
scheme is based on using the reserved field of the TCP header to indicate
whether the established connection is over a wired or a wireless link.
Additionally, the proposed scheme leverages the SNR ratio to detect the
reliability of the link and decide whether to reduce packet burst or retransmit
a timed-out packet. Experiments conducted, revealed that the proposed scheme
proved to behave correctly in situations where timeouts were due to error and
not to congestion. Future work can improve upon the proposed scheme so much so
that it can leverage CRC and HEC errors so as to better determine the cause of
transmission timeouts in wireless networks.

as qubits is a major goal for many theorists and experimentalists. The future
applications of quantum information technology would also require a reliable
method for the transportation of quantum information. A promising such method
is the propagation of electrons by a surface acoustic wave (SAW). In this
paper, we simulate the SAW transfer of two interacting electrons through a
Y-shaped junction. Our results show that the singlet and triplet states can be
differentiated in the Y-junction by an electrostatic detuning potential, an
effect that could be used in for example measuring the state of a two-spin

projected fixed-point method is defined and a new doubly stochastic projection
is adopted to derive the algorithm. Previous graph matching algorithms suffer
from high computational complexity and therefore do not have good scalability
with respect to graph size. For matching two weighted graphs of $n$ nodes, our
algorithm has time complexity only $O(n^3)$ per iteration and space complexity
$O(n^2)$. In addition to its scalability, our algorithm is easy to implement,
robust, and able to match undirected weighted attributed graphs of different
sizes. While the convergence rate of previous iterative graph matching
algorithms is unknown, our algorithm is theoretically guaranteed to converge at
a linear rate. Extensive experiments on large synthetic and real graphs (more
than 1,000 nodes) were conducted to evaluate the performance of various
algorithms. Results show that in most cases our proposed algorithm achieves
better performance than previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both
speed and accuracy in large graph matching. In particular, with high accuracy,
our algorithm takes only a few seconds (in a PC) to match two graphs of 1,000
nodes.

ubiquitous mobile sensors from personal GPS devices to mobile phones are
collecting massive amounts of data on urban systems. The locations,

new information technologies. This work utilizes novel dynamic data, generated
by mobile phone users, to measure spatiotemporal changes in population. In the
process, we identify the relationship between land use and dynamic population
over the course of a typical week. A machine learning classification algorithm
is used to identify clusters of locations with similar zoned uses and mobile
phone activity patterns. It is shown that the mobile phone data is capable of
delivering useful information on actual land use that supplements zoning

finite-precision arithmetic. If all the coefficients in the process are
rational numbers, then the model checking results are rational, and so they can
be computed exactly. However, exact techniques are generally too expensive or
limited in scalability. In this paper we propose a method for obtaining exact
results starting from an approximated solution in finite-precision arithmetic.
The input of the method is a description of a scheduler, which can be obtained
by a model checker using finite precision. Given a scheduler, we show how to
obtain a corresponding basis in a linear-programming problem, in such a way
that the basis is optimal whenever the scheduler attains the worst-case
probability. This correspondence is already known for discounted MDPs, we show
how to apply it in the undiscounted case provided that some preprocessing is
done. Using the correspondence, the linear-programming problem can be solved in
exact arithmetic starting from the basis obtained. As a consequence, the method
finds the worst-case probability even if the scheduler provided by the model
checker was not optimal. In our experiments, the calculation of exact solutions
from a candidate scheduler is significantly faster than the calculation using
the simplex method under exact arithmetic starting from a default basis.
