Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture is the parity conjecture: the global root
number matches the parity of the Mordell-Weil rank. Assuming finiteness of
$\mathrm{Sha}(E/K)[p^\infty]$ for a prime $p$ this is equivalent to the
$p$-parity conjecture: the global root number matches the parity of the
$\mathbb{Z}_p$-corank of the $p^\infty$-Selmer group. We complete the proof of
the $p$-parity conjecture for elliptic curves that have a $p$-isogeny for $p >
3$ (the cases $p \le 3$ were known). T. and V. Dokchitser have showed this in
the case when $E$ has semistable reduction at all places above $p$ by
establishing respective cases of a conjectural formula for the local root
number. We remove the restrictions on reduction types by proving their formula
in the remaining cases. We apply our result to show that the $p$-parity
conjecture holds for every $E$ with complex multiplication defined over $K$.
Consequently, if for such an elliptic curve $\mathrm{Sha}(E/K)[p^\infty]$ is
infinite, it must contain $(\mathbb{Q}_p/\mathbb{Z}_p)^2$.

Transverse Energy, E_T^eff, which shows an even better and more direct

the results, allowing a better and more robust identification of M_susy. The
extension of this procedure to other scenarios of new physics (not necessarily

decay into light degrees of freedom. This leads to dissipative effects that
modify the inflationary dynamics and may generate a nearly-thermal radiation
bath, such that inflation occurs in a warm rather than supercooled environment.
In this work, we perform a numerical computation and obtain expressions for the
associated dissipation coefficient in supersymmetric models, focusing on the
regime where the radiation temperature is below the heavy mass threshold. The
dissipation coefficient receives contributions from the decay of both on-shell
and off-shell degrees of freedom, which are dominant for small and large
couplings, respectively, taking into account the light field multiplicities. In
particular, we find that the contribution from on-shell decays, although
Boltzmann-suppressed, can be much larger than that of virtual modes, which is
bounded by the validity of a perturbative analysis. This result opens up new
possibilities for realizations of warm inflation in supersymmetric field
theories.

the standard model (SM) Higgs boson (H) in ppbar collisions at the Fermilab
Tevatron at sqrt(s)=1.96 TeV. Compared to the previous Tevatron Higgs boson
search combination, more data have been included, additional channels have been
incorporated, and some previously used channels have been reanalyzed to gain
sensitivity. Searches are carried out for hypothesized Higgs boson masses
between 100 and 200 GeV/c^2. With up to 10 fb-1 of luminosity analyzed, the 95%
C.L. median expected upper limits on Higgs boson production are factors of
0.89, 1.08, and 0.48 times the values of the SM cross section for Higgs bosons
of mass m_H=115 GeV/c^2, 125 GeV/c^2, and 165 GeV/c^2, respectively. In the
absence of signal, we expect to exclude the regions 100<m_{H}<120 GeV/c^2 and
139<m_H<184 GeV/c^2. We exclude, at the 95% CL, two regions: 100<m_H<103
GeV/c^2, and 147<m_H<180 GeV/c^2. There is a significant excess of data events
with respect to the background estimation in the mass range 115<m_H<140
GeV/c^2, which causes our observed limits to not be as stringent as expected.
At m_H=120 GeV/c^2, the p-value for a background fluctuation to produce this
excess is \sim1.5x10^-3, corresponding to a local significance of 3.0 standard
deviations. The global significance for such an excess anywhere in the full
mass range investigated is approximately 2.5 standard deviations. We also
combine separately searches for H to bb and H to WW. We find that the excess is
concentrated in the H to bb channel, appearing in the searches over a broad
range of m_H. The maximum local significance of 3.2 standard deviations
corresponds to a global significance of approximately 2.9 standard deviations.
Our results in the H to WW channels are also consistent with the possible
presence of a low-mass Higgs boson.

the LHC is consistent with a neutral pseudoscalar top-pion state. We
demonstrate that a neutral pseudoscalar top-pion can generate the diphoton
signal at the observed rate. However, the region of model parameter space where
this is the case does not correspond to classic topcolor-assisted technicolor
scenarios with degenerate charged and neutral top-pions and a top-Higgs mass of
order twice the top mass; rather, additional isospin violation would need to be
present and the top dynamics would be more akin to that in top seesaw models.
Moreover, the interpretation of the new state as a top-pion can be sustained
only if the ZZ (four-lepton) and WW (two-lepton plus missing energy) signatures
initially observed at the 3? level decline in significance as additional data
is accrued.

from some parts of the galactic plane poses serious challenges for any
interpretation of this surprise discovery. It is generally believed that the
unusually narrow profile of the spectral line cannot be explained by
conventional processes in astrophysical objects, and, if real, is likely to be
associated with Dark Matter. In this paper we argue that cold ultrarelativistic
pulsar winds can be alternative sources of very narrow gamma-ray lines. We
demonstrate that Comptonization of a cold ultrarelativistic electron-positron
pulsar wind in the deep Klein-Nishina regime can readily provide very narrow
distinct gamma-ray line features. To verify this prediction, we produced photon
count maps based on the Fermi LAT data in the energy interval 100 to 140 GeV.
We confirm earlier reports of the presence of marginal gamma-ray line-like
signals from three regions of the galactic plane. Although the maps show some
structure inside these regions, unfortunately the limited photon statistics do
not allow any firm conclusion in this regard. The confirmation of 130 GeV line
emission by low-energy threshold atmospheric Cherenkov telescope systems, in
particular by the new 27 m diameter dish of the H.E.S.S. array, would be
crucial for resolving the spatial structure of the reported hotspots, and thus
for distinguishing between the Dark Matter and Pulsar origins of the `Fermi
Lines'.

Dynamics of these measurements are solved in use of the fractional calculus

Entropy dynamics of the single qubit system reveals that the coupling with the

non-zero value. The effect of PBG reservoir on the concurrence of the two-qubit
system leads to the long-time entanglement preservation. The concurrence
dynamics shows that unphysical entanglement trapping does not exist in the

introducing a number of light gauge-singlet scalars, the ""darkons,"" some of
which could play the role of dark matter. These models allow for substantial
modifications to the decays of the lightest Higgs boson, for instance through
mixing with TeV-scale PH fields and light darkons: the simplest version of the
model predicts the ratios of partial widths to satisfy $\G(h \to
VV^*)_{\text{PH}}/\G(h \to VV^*)_{\text{SM}} \approx \G(h \to

inequalities are saturated only in the absence of Higgs mixing with light
darkons. An extension of the model proposed previously for generating nonzero

violating electroweak precision constraints. If the Higgs coupling to fermions

particles in gravitational and electromagnetic fields, and show that if the
Mathisson-Pirani spin condition holds then exact gravito-electromagnetic
analogies emerge. These analogies provide a familiar formalism to treat
gravitational problems, as well as a means for comparing the two interactions.
Fundamental differences are manifest in the symmetries and time projections of
the electromagnetic and gravitational tidal tensors. The physical consequences
of the symmetries of the tidal tensors are explored comparing the following
analogous setups: magnetic dipoles in the field of non-spinning/spinning
charges, and gyroscopes in the Schwarzschild, Kerr, and Kerr-de Sitter
spacetimes. The implications of the time projections of the tidal tensors are
illustrated by the work done on the particle in various frames; in particular,
a reciprocity is found to exist: in a frame comoving with the particle, the
electromagnetic (but not the gravitational) field does work on it, causing a
variation of its proper mass; conversely, for ""static observers,"" a stationary
gravitomagnetic (but not a magnetic) field does work on the particle, and the
associated potential energy is seen to embody the Hawking-Wald spin-spin
interaction energy. The issue of hidden momentum, and its counterintuitive
dynamical implications, is also analyzed. Finally, a number of issues regarding
the electromagnetic interaction and the physical meaning of Dixon's equations
are clarified.

charm decays. The value is sufficiently large that either substantially
enhanced Standard Model contributions or non-Standard Model physics is required
to explain it. In the latter case only a limited number of possibilities would
be consistent with other existing flavor-changing constraints. We show that
warped extra dimensional models that explain the quark spectrum through flavor
anarchy can naturally give rise to contributions of the size required to
explain the the LHCb result. The D meson asymmetry arises through a sizable
CP-violating contribution to a chromomagnetic dipole operator. This happens
naturally without introducing inconsistencies with existing constraints in the
up quark sector. We discuss some subtleties in the loop calculation that are
similar to those in Higgs to \gamma\gamma. Loop-induced dipole operators in
warped scenarios and their composite analogs exhibit non-trivial dependence on
the Higgs profile, with the contributions monotonically decreasing when the
Higgs is pushed away from the IR brane. We show that the size of the dipole
operator quickly saturates as the Higgs profile approaches the IR brane,
implying small dependence on the precise details of the Higgs profile when it
is quasi IR localized. We also explain why the calculation of the coefficient
of the lowest dimension 5D operator is guaranteed to be finite. This is true
not only in the charm sector but also with other radiative processes such as
electric dipole moments, b to s\gamma, \epsilon'/\epsilon_K and \mu\ to
e\gamma. We furthermore discuss the interpretation of this contribution within
the framework of partial compositeness in four dimensions and highlight some
qualitative differences between the generic result of composite models and that

contribute to the proton-proton double parton scattering (DPS) cross section.
These are the `2v1' or `single perturbative splitting' graphs, in which two
`nonperturbatively generated' (NP) ladders interact with two ladders that have
been generated via a perturbative 1->2 branching process. Using a detailed
calculation, we confirm the result first written down by Ryskin and Snigirev,
that 2v1 graphs in which the two NP ladders do not interact with one another do
contribute to the LO proton-proton DPS cross section, albeit with a different
geometrical prefactor to the one that applies to the `2v2'/`zero perturbative
splitting' graphs. We then show that 2v1 graphs in which the NP ladders
exchange partons with one another also contribute to the LO proton-proton DPS
cross section, provided that this `crosstalk' occurs at a lower scale than the
1->2 branching on the other side of the graph. Due to the preference in the 2v1
graphs for the x value at which the branching occurs/crosstalk ceases to be
much larger than x values at the hard scale, the effect of crosstalk
interactions is likely to be a decrease in the 2v1 cross section except at very
small x values (< 10^-6). At moderate x values ~10^-3 - 10^-2, the x value at
the splitting is in the region ~10^-1 where PDFs do not change much with scale,
and crosstalk effects are likely to be small. We give an explicit formula for
the contribution from the 2v1 graphs to the DPS cross section, and combine this
with the suggestion that `double perturbative splitting'/`1v1' graphs should be
removed from this cross section made in a previous publication, to obtain a
formula for the DPS cross section. We point out that there are two potentially
concerning features in this equation, that might indicate that our prescription
for handling the 1v1 graphs is not quite correct.

acquire information about the availability of unused subcarriers. In case of a
single secondary user (SU) in the secondary network, due to the lack of
information of PUs' activities, the SU randomly allocates the subcarriers of
the primary network and collide with the PUs' subcarriers with a certain
probability. To maintain the quality of service (QoS) requirement of PUs, the
interference that SU causes onto PUs is controlled by adjusting SU's transmit
power below a predefined threshold, referred to as interference temperature. In
this work, the average capacity of SU with subcarrier collisions is employed as
performance measure to investigate the proposed random allocation scheme for
both general and Rayleigh channel fading models. Bounds and scaling laws of
average capacity with respect to the number of SU's, PUs' and available
subcarriers are derived. In addition, in the presence of multiple SUs, the
multiuser diversity gain of SUs assuming an opportunistic scheduling is also
investigated. To avoid the interference at the SUs that might be caused by the
random allocation scheme and obtain the maximum sum rate for SUs based on the
available subcarriers, an efficient centralized sequential algorithm based on
the opportunistic scheduling and random allocation (utilization) methods is
proposed to ensure the orthogonality of assigned subcarriers.

R,P,S, satisfying the non-transitive relations S excludes P, P excludes R, and
R excludes S -- serves as a simple prototype for studying more complex
non-transitive systems. For well-mixed systems where interactions result in
fitness reductions of the losers exceeding fitness gains of the winners,
classical theory predicts that two strategies go extinct. The effects of
spatial heterogeneity and dispersal rates on this outcome are analyzed using a
general framework for evolutionary games in patchy landscapes. The analysis
reveals that coexistence is determined by the rates at which dominant
strategies invade a landscape occupied by the subordinate strategy (e.g. rock
invades a landscape occupied by scissors) and the rates at which subordinate
strategies get excluded in a landscape occupied by the dominant strategy (e.g.
scissor gets excluded in a landscape occupied by rock). These invasion and
exclusion rates correspond to eigenvalues of the linearized dynamics near
single strategy equilibria. Coexistence occurs when the product of the invasion
rates exceeds the product of the exclusion rates. Provided there is sufficient
spatial variation in payoffs, the analysis identifies a critical dispersal rate
$d^*$ required for regional persistence. For dispersal rates below $d^*$, the
product of the invasion rates exceed the product of the exclusion rates and the
rock-paper-scissor metacommunities persist regionally despite being extinction
prone locally. For dispersal rates above $d^*$, the product of the exclusion
rates exceed the product of the invasion rates and the strategies are
extinction prone. These results highlight the delicate interplay between
spatial heterogeneity and dispersal in mediating long-term outcomes for
evolutionary games.

revisit theories where Higgs bosons can couple to weak gauge bosons with
enhanced strength relative to the Standard Model value. Specifically, we look
at the Georgi-Machacek model and its generalizations where higher ""spin""
representations of SU(2)_L break electroweak symmetry while maintaining
custodial SU(2). In these theories, there is not only a Higgs-like boson but
partner Higgs scalars transforming under representations of custodial SU(2),
leading to a rich phenomenology. These theories serve as a consistent
theoretical and experimental framework to explain enhanced couplings to gauge
bosons, including fermiophobic Higgses. We focus on the phenomenology of a
neutral scalar partner to the Higgs, which is determined once the Higgs
couplings are specified. Depending on the parameter space, this partner could
have i) enhanced fermion and gauge boson couplings and should be searched for
at high mass (> 600 GeV), ii) have suppressed couplings and could be searched
for at lower masses, where the Standard Model Higgs has already been ruled out,
and iii) have fermiophilic couplings, where it can be searched for in heavy
Higgs and top resonance searches. In the first two regions, the partner also
has substantial decay rates into a pair of Higgs bosons. We touch briefly on
the more model-dependent effects of the nontrivial SU(2)_C multiplets, which
have exotic signals, such as a doubly-charged Higgs. We also discuss how the
loop induced effects of these scalars tend to reduce the Higgs decay rate to
photons, adding an additional uncertainty when extracting the couplings for the
Higgs boson.

and A_Li~1.8 are found. We speculate that most of the stars on the low A_Li
side of the desert have experienced a short-lived period of severe surface
lithium destruction as main-sequence or subgiant stars. Next, we search for
differences in the lithium content of thin-disk and thick-disk stars, but we
find that internal processes have erased from the stellar photospheres their
possibly different histories of lithium enrichment. Nevertheless, we note that
the maximum lithium abundance of thick-disk stars is nearly constant from
[Fe/H]=-1.0 to -0.1, at a value that is similar to that measured in very
metal-poor halo stars (A_Li~2.2). Finally, differences in the lithium abundance
distribution of known planet-host stars relative to otherwise ordinary stars
appear when restricting the samples to narrow ranges of Teff or mass, but they
are fully explained by age and metallicity biases. We confirm the lack of a
connection between low lithium abundance and planets. However, we find that no
low A_Li planet-hosts are found in the desert Teff window. Provided that subtle
sample biases are not responsible for this observation, this suggests that the
presence of gas giant planets inhibit the mechanism responsible for the lithium

low-amplitude tides, and the energy extracted from the hole's rotation is
always smaller than the gravitational radiation lost to infinity. Thus, moons
orbiting a black hole inspiral and eventually merge. However, it has been
conjectured that in higher-dimensional spacetimes orbiting bodies generate much
stronger tides, which backreact by tidally accelerating the body outwards. This
effect, analogous to the tidal acceleration experienced by the Earth-Moon
system, would determine the evolution of the binary. Here, we put this
conjecture to the test, by studying matter coupled to a massless scalar field
in orbit around a singly-spinning rotating black hole in higher dimensions. We
show that in dimensions larger than five the energy extracted from the black
hole through superradiance is larger than the energy carried out to infinity.
Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with analytic approximations
and lend strong support to the conjecture that tidal acceleration is the rule,
rather than the exception, in higher dimensions. Superradiance dominates the
energy budget and moons ""outspiral""; for some particular orbital frequency, the
energy extracted at the horizon equals the energy emitted to infinity and
""floating orbits"" generically occur. We give an interpretation of this
phenomenon in terms of the membrane paradigm and of tidal acceleration due to
energy dissipation across the horizon.

investigate 14-195 keV spectra from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)
all-sky survey for evidence of non-thermal excess emission above the
exponentially decreasing tail of thermal emission in the flux-limited HIFLUGCS
sample. To account for the thermal contribution at BAT energies, XMM-Newton
EPIC spectra are extracted from coincident spatial regions so that both thermal

marginally significant IC components in six clusters, though after closer
inspection and consideration of systematic errors we are unable to claim a

enhance a cumulative non-thermal signal not quite detectable in individual
clusters. After constructing a model based on single-temperature fits to the

predicted by the thermal model determined at soft energies. This result also
holds for the summed spectra of various subgroups, except for the subsample of
clusters with diffuse radio emission. For clusters hosting a diffuse radio
halo, a relic, or a mini-halo, non-thermal emission is initially detected at
the \sim5-sigma confidence level - driven by clusters with mini-halos - but
modeling and systematic uncertainties ultimately degrade this significance. In
individual clusters, the non-thermal pressure of relativistic electrons is
limited to \sim10% of the thermal electron pressure, with stricter limits for
the more massive clusters, indicating that these electrons are likely not
dynamically important in the central regions of clusters.

vector model still possesses infinitely many symmetries leading to infinitely
many conserved currents which stand behind its solvability. It turns out that
the similarities and differences of the two models depend strongly on the
specific form of the potential. We find, for instance, that compactons (which
exist in the BPS baby Skyrme model) disappear from the spectrum of solutions of
the vector counterpart. Specifically, for the vector model with the old baby
Skyrme potential we find that it has compacton solutions only provided that a
delta function source term effectively screening the topological charge is
inserted at the compacton boundary. For the old baby Skyrme potential squared
we find that the vector model supports exponentially localized solitons, like
the BPS baby Skyrme model. These solitons, however, saturate a BPS bound which
is a nonlinear function of the topological charge and, as a consequence, higher
solitons are unstable w.r.t. decay into smaller ones, which is at variance with
the more conventional situation (a linear BPS bound and stable solitons) in the

host stars, ii) a need to characterise the distribution of rare warm disks, and
iii) the possible identification of candidates for discovering transiting dust
concentrations. We find about 8,000 stars that have excess emission, mostly at
12um. The positions of these stars correlate with the 100um background level so
most of the flux measurements associated with these excesses are spurious. We
identify 271 stars with plausible excesses by making a 5MJy/sr cut in the IRAS
100um emission. The number counts of these excesses, at both 12 and 22um, have
the same distribution as extra-Galactic number counts. Thus, although some
excesses may be circumstellar, most can be explained as chance alignments with
background galaxies. The one exception is a 22um excess associated with a
relatively nearby A-type star that we were able to confirm because the disk
occurrence rate is independent of stellar distance. Despite our low detection
rate, these results place valuable upper limits on the distribution of large
mid-infrared excesses; e.g. fewer than 1:1000 stars have 12um excesses (F_
obs/F_star) larger than a factor of five. In contrast to previous studies, we
find no evidence for disks around 1790 stars with candidate planets (we
attribute one significant 12um excess to a background galaxy), and no evidence
that the disk distribution around planet hosts is different to the bulk
population. Higher resolution imaging of stars with excesses is the best way to
rule out galaxy confusion and identify more reliable disk candidates among
Kepler stars. A similar survey to ours that focusses on nearby stars would be
well suited to finding the distribution of rare warm disks.

around specific constant values. Moreover, the fluctuations statistics are
different above and below the critical threshold, and thus intimately connected

formation efficiency (SFE) mildly increases with M_*. The evolutionary track in
the SSFR-M_* diagram, as well as that in the color magnitude diagram are linked
to the HI content; below this transition mass, the star formation is regulated
strongly by the HI. Comparison of HI- and optically-selected samples over the
same restricted volume shows that the HI-selected population is less evolved
and has overall higher SFR and SSFR at a given stellar mass, but lower SFE and
extinction, suggesting either that a bottleneck exists in the HI to H_2
conversion, or that the process of SF in the very HI-dominated galaxies obeys
an unusual, low efficiency star formation law. A trend is found that, for a
given stellar mass, high gas fraction galaxies reside preferentially in dark
matter halos with high spin parameters. Because it represents a full census of
HI-bearing galaxies at z~0, the scaling relations and fundamental planes
derived for the ALFALFA population can be used to assess the HI detection rate
by future blind HI surveys and intensity mapping experiments at higher
redshift.

in the dynamics of biological populations, we investigate its implications in a
paradigmatic model for the evolution of a single species density $u(x,t)$. The
standard model includes growth and competition in a logistic expression, and
spreading is modeled through normal diffusion. Moreover, the competition term
is nonlocal, which has been shown to give rise to spatial patterns. We
generalize the diffusion term through the nonlinear form $\partial_t u(x,t) = D
\partial_{xx} u(x,t)^\nu$ (with $D, \nu>0$), encompassing the cases where the
state-dependent diffusion coefficient either increases ($\nu>1$) or decreases
($\nu<1$) with the density, yielding subdiffusion or superdiffusion,
respectively. By means of numerical simulations and analytical considerations,
we display how that nonlinearity alters the phase diagram. The type of
diffusion imposes critical values of the model parameters for the onset of
patterns and strongly influences their shape, inducing fragmentation in the
subdiffusive case. The detection of the main persistent mode allows analytical
prediction of the critical thresholds.

only indirectly, through smooth functionals of the signal whose values are then

eliminate some of the signal's interesting features. This makes it difficult or
even impossible to fully reconstruct the signal, even without noise. In this
paper, we develop methods for handling sequences of related inverse problems,
with the problems varying either systematically or randomly over time. Such
sequences often arise with automated data collection systems, like the data
pipelines of large astronomical instruments such as the Large Synoptic Survey
Telescope (LSST). The LSST will observe each patch of the sky many times over
its lifetime under varying conditions. A possible additional complication in
these problems is that the observational resolution is limited by the
instrument, so that even with many repeated observations, only an approximation
of the underlying signal can be reconstructed. We propose an efficient
estimator for reconstructing a signal of interest given a sequence of related,
resolution-limited inverse problems. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness

using a virtualization engine, freeing them from the need to make sure that the

managing a virtual appliance, versus a stand-alone application, requires
special considerations. Upgrading a software system is a common requirement,
and is more complicated when dealing with an appliance. This is because both
the target application and the running environment must be upgraded, and there

a collection of hypersurfaces in a hypercube. However, due to sampling error
the faithfulness condition alone is not sufficient for statistical estimation,
and strong-faithfulness has been proposed and assumed to achieve uniform or
high-dimensional consistency. In contrast to the plain faithfulness assumption,
the set of distributions that is not strong-faithful has nonzero Lebesgue
measure and in fact, can be surprisingly large as we show in this paper. We
study the strong-faithfulness condition from a geometric and combinatorial
point of view and give upper and lower bounds on the Lebesgue measure of
strong-faithful distributions for various classes of directed acyclic graphs.

the range from several decades to hundreds of years, are limiting the practical
use of this method to study the properties of dusty tori. However, our results

exchanged between the electromagnetic field and the material medium. The
resulting change in the energy of the reflected photons is directly related to
their Doppler shift arising from the change in the state of motion of the
mirror. Similarly, the Doppler shift of photons that enter an absorber is
intimately tied to the kinetic energy and momentum acquired by the absorber in
its interaction with the incident light. The argument from the Doppler shift
yields expressions for the exchanged energy and momentum that are identical
with those obtained from Maxwell's equations and the Lorentz law of force,

different. Here we apply the Doppler shift argument to a submerged partial
reflector (one that absorbs a fraction of the incident light), deducing in the
process the magnitude of the photon momentum within the submerging medium. We

\emph{structural} assumptions on the input graph; in particular, it has been
proved for complements of trees, and later extended to complements of bipartite
graphs, and these are the only known results so far. Our main result in this
article is that the above conjecture is true for every graph $G$ that admits a
tolerance representation with exactly one unbounded vertex; note here that this
assumption concerns only the given tolerance \emph{representation} $R$ of $G$,
rather than any structural property of $G$. Moreover, our results imply as a
corollary that the conjecture of Golumbic, Monma, and Trotter is true for every
graph $G=(V,E)$ that has no three independent vertices $a,b,c\in V$ such that
$N(a) \subset N(b) \subset N(c)$; this is satisfied in particular when $G$ is
the complement of a triangle-free graph (which also implies the above-mentioned
correctness for complements of bipartite graphs). Our proofs are constructive,
in the sense that, given a tolerance representation $R$ of a graph $G$, we
transform $R$ into a bounded tolerance representation $R^{\ast}$ of $G$.
Furthermore, we conjecture that any \emph{minimal} tolerance graph $G$ that is
not a bounded tolerance graph, has a tolerance representation with exactly one

reality in femtocell networks makes interference management (IM) the key to
maintaining the quality of service and fairness in femtocell networks.
Over-the-air signaling is one of the most effective means for fast distributed
dynamic IM. However, the design of this type of signal is challenging. In this
paper, we address the challenges and propose an effective solution, referred to
as single-tone signaling (STS). The proposed STS scheme possesses many highly
desirable properties, such as no dedicated resource requirement (no system
overhead), no near-far effect, no inter-signal interference, and immunity to
synchronization error. In addition, the proposed STS signal provides a means
for high quality wideband channel estimation for the use of coordinated
techniques, such as coordinated beamforming. Based on the proposed STS, two
distributed dynamic IM schemes, ON/OFF power control and SLNR
(signal-to-leakage-plus-noise-ratio)-based transmitter beam coordination, are
proposed. Simulation results show significant performance improvement as a
result of the use of STS-based IM schemes.

  We investigate the structural properties in TSP instances that influence the

bound the runtime of simple evolutionary algorithms. Our analysis studies the
runtime in dependence of the number of inner points $k$ and shows that $(\mu +

results in an upper bound of $O((\mu/\lambda) \cdot n^3\gamma(\epsilon) +

the previous upper bound, and the indications of a sizable deviation of
$\theta_{23}$ from the maximal value are in agreement with the predictions of
Anarchy in the lepton sector. The quark and charged lepton hierarchies can then
be reproduced in a SU(5) GUT context by attributing non-vanishing $U(1)_{FN}$
charges, different for each family, only to the SU(5) tenplet states. The fact
that the observed mass hierarchies are stronger for up quarks than for down
quarks and charged leptons supports this idea. As discussed in the past, in the
flexible context of $SU(5)\otimes U(1)_{FN}$, different patterns of charges can
be adopted going from Anarchy to various types of hierarchy. We revisit this
approach by also considering new models and we compare all versions to the
present data. As a result we confirm that, by relaxing the extreme ansatz of
equal $U(1)_{FN}$ charges for all SU(5) pentaplets and singlets, better
agreement with the data than for Anarchy is obtained without increasing the
model complexity. We also present the distributions obtained in the different
models for the Dirac CP-violating phase. Finally we discuss the relative merits
of these simple models.

this is that the algebra of smooth functions on space-time has to be made
noncommutative. The generalized differential geometry of space-time is
constructed in terms of the algebra A (and its derivations) on a transformation
groupoid. Regular representation {\pi} of A in the algebra of bounded operators
on a bundle of Hilbert spaces leads to the algebra \pi(A) = M_0 which can be
completed to the von Neumann algebra M . The representation \pi establishes the
isomorphism between A and M_0 which, in turn, implies the isomorphism between
moduli of their derivations. In this way, geometry naturally transfers to the
algebra M_0 and its derivations. Although geometry, as defined in terms of M_0,
is formally isomorphic to that defined in terms of A, it exhibits a strong
probabilistic flavour. However, the geometry of M_0 does not prolong to M .

construct, in a deterministic distributed way, a backbone structure on the top

designed in a simpler model of ad hoc broadcast networks without interference
into the SINR physical model with uniform power of stations, without increasing
their asymptotic time complexity. The time cost of the backbone data structure
construction is only O(Delta polylog n) rounds, where Delta is roughly the
inverse of network density and n is the number of nodes in the whole network.
The core of the construction is a novel combinatorial structure called
SINR-selector, which is introduced and constructed in this paper. We
demonstrate the power of the backbone data structure by using it for obtaining
efficient O(D+Delta polylog n)-round and O(D+k+Delta polylog n)-round
deterministic distributed solutions for leader election and multi-broadcast,
respectively, where D is the network diameter and k is the number of messages

analysed here span 19 months. Kepler provides the longest continuous timeseries
currently available, which calls for a study of the influence of the increased
timespan on the accuracy and precision of the obtained results. We find that in
general a minimum of the order of 400 day long timeseries are necessary to
obtain reliable results for the global oscillation parameters in more than 95%
of the stars, but this does depend on <dnu>. In a statistical sense the quoted
uncertainties seem to provide a reasonable indication of the precision of the
obtained results in short (50-day) runs, they do however seem to be
overestimated for results of longer runs. Furthermore, the different
definitions of the global parameters used in the different methods have
non-negligible effects on the obtained values. Additionally, we show that there
is a correlation between nu_max and the flux variance. We conclude that longer
timeseries improve the likelihood to detect oscillations with automated codes
(from ~60% in 50 day runs to > 95% in 400 day runs with a slight method
dependence) and the precision of the obtained global oscillation parameters.
The trends suggest that the improvement will continue for even longer
timeseries than the 600 days considered here, with a reduction in the median
absolute deviation of more than a factor of 10 for an increase in timespan from
50 to 2000 days (the currently foreseen length of the mission). This work shows
that global parameters determined with high precision - thus from long datasets
- using different definitions can be used to identify the evolutionary state of
the stars. (abstract truncated)

B with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope. The gamma-ray emission in the energy band between \sim100 MeV and
\sim100 GeV is predicted to trace the gas mass distribution in the clouds
through nuclear interactions between the Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) and
interstellar gas. The gamma-ray production cross-section for the nuclear
interaction is known to \sim10% precision which makes the LAT a powerful tool
to measure the gas mass column density distribution of molecular clouds for a
known CR intensity. We present here such distributions for Orion A and B, and
correlate them with those of the velocity integrated CO intensity (WCO) at a
1{\deg} \times1{\deg} pixel level. The correlation is found to be linear over a
WCO range of ~10 fold when divided in 3 regions, suggesting penetration of
nuclear CRs to most of the cloud volumes. The Wco-to-mass conversion factor,
Xco, is found to be \sim2.3\times10^20 cm-2(K km s-1)-1 for the high-longitude
part of Orion A (l > 212{\deg}), \sim1.7 times higher than \sim1.3 \times 10^20
found for the rest of Orion A and B. We interpret the apparent high Xco in the
high-longitude region of Orion A in the light of recent works proposing a
non-linear relation between H2 and CO densities in the diffuse molecular gas.
Wco decreases faster than the H2 column density in the region making the gas
""darker"" to Wco.

determining the evolution of a highly-anisotropic fluid have been introduced.

thermalization of the system has been defined. In the simplest case of
purely-longitudinal and boost-invariant expansion, different features of the
model have been analyzed. Using the ADHYDRO model in the general (3+1)D and
boost-invariant (2+1)D versions, different possible scenarios of early stages
of heavy-ion collisions have been analyzed. The results of the ADHYDRO model
have been compared to the results obtained from the reference, perfect-fluid
hydrodynamic model -- LHYQUID. The results of the hydrodynamic models were
coupled to the statistical Monte-Carlo model THERMINATOR. The following
conclusions have been drawn: a) All studied observables are almost insensitive
to the initial anisotropic stage provided the initial conditions of the
evolution are properly readjusted, b) Complete thermalization of matter may
take place only at the times of about 1 fm/c. In this way the early
thermalization puzzle may be circumvented.

a pair of polynomials which has a GCD of the given degree and whose

perturbations as small as possible, along with the GCD. The problem of
approximate GCD is transfered to a constrained minimization problem, then
solved with the so-called modified Newton method, which is a generalization of
the gradient-projection method, by searching the solution iteratively. We
demonstrate that, in some test cases, our algorithm calculates approximate GCD
with perturbations as small as those calculated by a method based on the
structured total least norm (STLN) method and the UVGCD method, while our
method runs significantly faster than theirs by approximately up to 30 or 10
times, respectively, compared with their implementation. We also show that our
algorithm properly handles some ill-conditioned polynomials which have a GCD

out that molecular dynamics simulations of such systems ask for a number of
solvent particles that can be reached without seriously compromising
computational efficiency only by employing a coarse-grained model. The MARTINI
force field with polarizable water offers a framework particularly suited for
the parameterization of our systems. In general, its advantages over other
coarse-grained models are the possibility to explore faster long time scales
and the wider range of applicability. Although the accuracy is sometimes put
under question, the results for the wetting properties by pure water are in
good agreement with those for the corresponding atomistic systems and
theoretical predictions. On the other hand, the bulk properties of various
aqueous surfactant solutions indicate that the micellar formation process is
too strong. For this reason, a typical experimental configuration is better
approached by preparing the droplets with the surfactants arranged in the
initial state in the vicinity of contact line. Cross-comparisons are possible
and illuminating, but equilibrium contanct angles as obtained from simulations
overestimate the experimental results. Nevertheless, our findings can provide
guidelines for the preliminary assessment and screening of surfactants. [See

parameter $R$ takes positive integer values. The models corresponding to all
the odd values of $R$ are known to have the same exact doubly degenerate dimer

R=2 (the Bethe ansatz solvable Heisenberg chain) and in the asymptotic limit of
$R$ where the two MG dimer states again emerge as the exact ground state. In
the present work, we numerically investigate the even-$R$ models whose ground
state is not known analytically. In particular, for R=4, 6 and 8, we have
computed a number of ground state properties. We find that, unlike R=2, the
higher even-$R$ models are spin-gapped, and show strong dimer-dimer

self-dual excitations, which are composites of the positive frequencies of the

few spiral and dwarf galaxies, presumably result from galaxy mergers.
Line-of-sight velocity distributions of the shells could, in principle, if
measured with a sufficiently high S/N, constitute one of methods to constrain
the gravitational potential of the host galaxy. Merrifield & Kuijken (1998)
predicted a double-peaked line profile for stationary shells resulting from a
nearly radial minor merger. In this paper, we aim at extending their analysis
to a more realistic case of expanding shells, inherent to the merging process,
whereas we assume the same type of merger and the same orbital geometry. We use
analytical approach as well as test particle simulations to predict the
line-of-sight velocity profile across the shell structure. Simulated line
profiles are convolved with spectral PSFs to estimate the peak detectability.
The resulting line-of-sight velocity distributions are more complex than
previously predicted due to non-zero phase velocity of the shells. In
principle, each of the Merrifield & Kuijken (1998) peaks splits into two,
giving a quadruple-peaked line profile, which allows more precise determination
of the potential of the host galaxy and, moreover, contains additional
information. We find simple analytical expressions that connect the positions
of the four peaks of the line profile and the mass distribution of the galaxy,
namely the circular velocity at the given shell radius and the propagation
velocity of the shell. The analytical expressions were applied to a
test-particle simulation of a radial minor merger and the potential of the
simulated host galaxy was successfully recovered. The shell kinematics can thus
become an independent tool to determine the content and distribution of the
dark matter in shell galaxies, up to ~100 kpc from the center of the host
galaxy.

covariance, the radiation energy spectrum is expected to conform to the

normal angle of incidence a metallic screen, the transverse and the
longitudinal spatial coordinates of the electron bunch play different roles in
determining the N single electron radiation field amplitudes and their relative
phases in relation to the different physical constraints which an
electromagnetic radiative mechanism by a charged beam must meet: i.e., temporal
causality and covariance. The distribution of the N electron longitudinal
coordinates determines indeed the sequence of the N electron collisions onto
the metallic screen and, on the basis of the temporal causality principle, it
also determines the distribution function of the relative emission phases of
the N single electron field amplitudes from the metallic surface. The
distribution of the transverse coordinates of the N electrons contributes as
well to determine the relative phase distribution of the N electron field
amplitudes at the observation point - located on the longitudinal axis of the
reference frame - providing a further phase information that accounts for the
transverse displacement of the N electrons with respect to the beam axis. The
distribution of the transverse coordinates of the N electrons is a relativistic
invariant under a Lorentz transformation with respect to the direction of
motion of the beam and, consequently, it is expected to leave a covariant mark
on the N single electron amplitudes composing the radiation field. The
covariant imprinting of the N electron transverse density on the radiation
field affects both the temporal coherent and incoherent parts of the transition

multiplicity, whose inner and outer orbits are well-known. Methods:
Photometric, spectroscopic, and interferometric data were analyzed, revealing
the basic physical properties of the system 65 UMa. A disentangling technique
is used to perform the spectra decomposition. This combined approach allows us
to study the long-term period changes in the system, identifying the period
variation due to the motion on the visual orbit, in addition to a short-term
modulation. Results: We find that the system contains one more component, hence
65 UMa is a sextuple hierarchical system. The most inner pair of components
consists of an eclipsing binary orbiting around a barycenter on a circular
orbit, both components being almost identical of spectral type about A7. This
pair orbits on an eccentric orbit around a barycenter, and the third component
orbits with a period of about 640 days. This motion is reflected in the period
variation in the minima times of the eclipsing pair, as well as in the radial
velocities of the primary, secondary, and tertiary components. Moreover, this
system orbits around a barycenter with the distant component resolved
interferometrically, whose period is of about 118 years. Two more distant
components (4"" and 63"") are also probably gravitationally bound to the system.
The nodal period of the eclipsing-pair orbit is on the order of only a few
centuries, which makes this system even more interesting for a future
prospective detection of changing the depths of minima. Conclusions: We
identify a unique solution of the system 65 UMa, decomposing the individual
components and even shifting the system to higher multiplicity. The study of
this kind of multiple can help us to understand the origin of stellar systems.
Besides 65 UMa, only another 11 sextuple systems have been studied.

principles of quantum measurement with the aid of the Michelson interferometer.
Weak measurement is then introduced in a simple visualized manner by a specific
choice of the reflecting mirror's position and momentum uncertainties. Having
introduced the method, we proceed to its refinement for a single particle. We
consider a photon going back and forth inside the interferometer, oscillating
between a superposed and a localized state, while subjected to alternating
strong and weak measurements. This cyclic process enables directly measuring
both the photon's position (""which-path"") and momentum (interference), without
disturbing either. An alternative explanation of this result, not invoking weak
values, is thoroughly considered and shown to be at odds with the experimental
data. Finally a practical application of this experiment is demonstrated, where
a single photon measures the various transmission coefficients of a multiport
beam-splitter yet remains superposed. This method is then generalized to
measurement of the wave-function itself, performed again on a single particle.

the formation of a disk or a pseudo-disk, outflow launching, and fragmentation.
We post-process the dynamical calculations using the 3D radiative transfer code
RADMC-3D. We compute spectral energy distributions and usual evolutionary stage
indicators such as bolometric luminosity and temperature. We find that the
first hydrostatic core lifetimes depend strongly on the initial magnetization
level of the parent dense core. We derive, for the first time, spectral energy
distribution evolutionary sequences from high-resolution
radiation-magneto-hydrodynamic calculations. We show that under certain
conditions, first hydrostatic cores can be identified from dust continuum
emission at 24 microns and 70 microns. We also show that single spectral energy
distributions cannot help to distinguish between the formation scenarios of the

Spectral energy distributions are a first useful and direct way to target first

technology has attracted attention in wireless communications, because it

spreading the same total transmit power over the antennas to achieve an array
gain that improves the spectral efficiency (more bits per second per hertz of

update of the tensors in the matrix product state to a finite window, with left

of a dynamical window, namely a window where the positions of left and right
boundaries are allowed to change in time. In this way, all simulation efforts
can be devoted to the space-time region of interest, which leads to a
remarkable reduction in computational costs. For illustrative purposes, we
consider two applications in the context of the spin-1 antiferromagnetic
Heisenberg model in an infinite spin chain: one is an expanding window, with
boundaries that are adjusted to capture the expansion in time of a local
perturbation of the system; the other is a moving window of fixed size, where
the position of the window follows the front of a propagating wave.

re-examine the spectrum with a self-consistent relativistic reflection model. A
narrow absorption line near 7.2 keV may be present, which if real is likely the
Fe XXVI absorption line arising from highly ionised, rapidly outflowing disc
wind. The blue shift of this feature corresponds to a velocity of about 11100
km/s, which is much larger than the typical values seen in stellar-mass black
holes. Given that we also find the source to have a low inclination (i < 32
degrees; close to face-on), we would therefore be seeing through the very base
of outflow. This could be a possible explanation for the unusually high
velocity. We use a reflection model combined with a relativistic convolution
kernel which allows for both prograde and retrograde black hole spin, and treat
the potential absorption feature with a physical model for a photo-ionised
plasma. In this manner, assuming the disc is not truncated, we could only

decades. Although Zipf's law is perhaps the most popular case, recently,
Menzerath's law has begun to be involved. Menzerath's law manifests in
language, music and genomes as a tendency of the mean size of the parts to
decrease as the number of parts increases in many situations. This statistical
regularity emerges also in the context of genomes, for instance, as a tendency
of species with more chromosomes to have a smaller mean chromosome size. It has
been argued that the instantiation of this law in genomes is not indicative of
any parallel between language and genomes because (a) the law is inevitable and
(b) non-coding DNA dominates genomes. Here mathematical, statistical and
conceptual challenges of these criticisms are discussed. Two major conclusions
are drawn: the law is not inevitable and languages also have a correlate of
non-coding DNA. However, the wide range of manifestations of the law in and
outside genomes suggests that the striking similarities between non-coding DNA
and certain linguistics units could be anecdotal for understanding the
recurrence of that statistical law.

constraints on their origin as deduced from the mass-period diagram of planets.
The most surprising features in the diagram are 1) the (apparent) pile up of
gas giants at a period of $\sim 500$ days ($\sim1$ AU) and 2) the so-called
mass-period relation which indicates that planetary mass is an increasing
function of orbital period. We construct the evolutionary tracks of growing
planets at planet traps in evolving protoplanetary disks and show that they
provide a good physical understanding of how these observational properties
arise. The fundamental feature of our model is that inhomogeneities in
protoplanetary disks give rise to multiple (up to 3) trapping sites for rapid
(type I) planetary migration of planetary cores. The viscous evolution of disks
results in the slow radial movement of the traps and their cores from large to
small orbital periods. In our model, the slow inward motion of planet traps is
coupled with the standard core accretion scenario for planetary growth. As
planets grow, type II migration takes over. Planet growth and radial movement
are ultimately stalled by the dispersal of gas disks via photoevaporation. Our
model makes a number of important predictions: that distinct sub-populations of
planets that reflect the properties of planet traps where they have grown
result in the mass-period relation; that the presence of these sub-populations
naturally explains a pile-up of planets at $\sim 1$ AU; and that evolutionary
tracks from the ice line do put planets at short periods and fill an earlier
claimed ""planet desert"" - sparse population of planets in the mass-semi-major
axis diagram.

that up to 69% of the quiet solar surface at disk center shows Stokes Q or U
profiles with amplitudes larger than 0.032% (4.5 times the noise level of 7 x

determination of the field inclination, field strength, and field azimuth
because the information carried by all four Stokes spectra is used
simultaneously. The inversion is performed for 53% of the observed field of

Seyfert 1 galaxies. In 2008, PHL 1092 was found to be in a remarkably low X-ray
flux state during an XMM-Newton observation. Its 2 keV flux density had dropped
by a factor of ~260 with respect to a previous observation performed 4.5 yr
earlier. The UV flux remained almost constant, resulting in a significant
steepening of the optical-to-X-ray slope alpha_ox from -1.57 to -2.51, making
PHL 1092 one of the most extreme X-ray weak quasars with no observed broad
absorption lines (BALs) in the UV. We have monitored the source since 2008 with
three further XMM-Newton observations, producing a simultaneous UV and X-ray
database spanning almost 10 yr in total in the activity of the source. Our
monitoring program demonstrates that the alpha_ox variability in PHL 1092 is
entirely driven by long-term X-ray flux changes. We apply a series of
physically-motivated models with the goal of explaining the UV-to-X-ray
spectral energy distribution (SED) and the extreme X-ray and alpha_ox
variability. We consider three possible models: i) A ""breathing corona""
scenario in which the size of the X-ray emitting corona is correlated with the
X-ray flux. In this case, the lowest X-ray flux states of PHL 1092 are
associated with an almost complete collapse of the X-ray corona down to the
marginal stable orbit; ii) An absorption scenario in which the X-ray flux
variability is entirely due to intervening absorption. If so, PHL 1092 is a
quasar with standard X-ray output for its optical luminosity, appearing as
X-ray weak at times due to absorption; iii) A disc-reflection-dominated
scenario in which the X-ray emitting corona is confined within a few
gravitational radii from the black hole at all times. In this case, the
intrinsic variability of PHL 1092 only needs to be a factor of ~10 rather than
the observed factor of ~260.

literature is the study of optimization methodologies that can evolve along
with the problems solved. Particularly, present evolutionary optimization
approaches generally start their search from scratch or the ground-zero state
of knowledge, independent of how similar the given new problem of interest is
to those optimized previously. There has thus been the apparent lack of
automated knowledge transfers and reuse across problems. Taking the cue, this
paper introduces a novel Memetic Computational Paradigm for search, one that
models after how human solves problems, and embarks on a study towards
intelligent evolutionary optimization of problems through the transfers of
structured knowledge in the form of memes learned from previous problem-solving
experiences, to enhance future evolutionary searches. In particular, the
proposed memetic search paradigm is composed of four culture-inspired
operators, namely, Meme Learning, Meme Selection, Meme Variation and Meme
Imitation. The learning operator mines for memes in the form of latent
structures derived from past experiences of problem-solving. The selection
operator identifies the fit memes that replicate and transmit across problems,
while the variation operator introduces innovations into the memes. The
imitation operator, on the other hand, defines how fit memes assimilate into
the search process of newly encountered problems, thus gearing towards
efficient and effective evolutionary optimization. Finally, comprehensive
studies on two widely studied challenging well established NP-hard routing
problem domains, particularly, the capacitated vehicle routing (CVR) and
capacitated arc routing (CAR), confirm the high efficacy of the proposed
memetic computational search paradigm for intelligent evolutionary optimization
of problems.

every n there exists N such that every N-term sequence a of real numbers
contains an n-term increasing subsequence or an n-term nondecreasing
subsequence; quantitatively, the smallest N with this property equals
(n-1)^2+1. In the setting of the present paper, we express this lemma by saying
that the set of predicates Phi={x_1<x_2,x_1\ge x_2}$ is Erdos-Szekeres with
Ramsey function ES_Phi(n)=(n-1)^2+1.
  In general, we consider an arbitrary finite set Phi={Phi_1,...,Phi_m} of
semialgebraic predicates, meaning that each Phi_j=Phi_j(x_1,...,x_k) is a
Boolean combination of polynomial equations and inequalities in some number k
of real variables. We define Phi to be Erdos-Szekeres if for every n there
exists N such that each N-term sequence a of real numbers has an n-term
subsequence b such that at least one of the Phi_j holds everywhere on b, which
means that Phi_j(b_{i_1},...,b_{i_k}) holds for every choice of indices
i_1,i_2,...,i_k, 1<=i_1<i_2<... <i_k<= n. We write ES_Phi(n) for the smallest N
with the above property.
  We prove two main results. First, the Ramsey functions in this setting are at
most doubly exponential (and sometimes they are indeed doubly exponential): for
every Phi that is Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres, there is a constant C such that
ES_Phi(n) < exp(exp(Cn)). Second, there is an algorithm that, given Phi,
decides whether it is Erdos-Szekeres; thus, one-dimensional
Erdos-Szekeres-style theorems can in principle be proved automatically.

intensive experimental scrutiny. Here, we develop a path integral treatment
that provides a divergence-free description of the paired state in
two-dimensional Fermi gases. Within this formalism, we derive the pseudogap
temperature and the pair fluctuation spectral function, and compare these
results with the recent experimental measument of the pairing in the
two-dimensional Fermi gas. The removal of the infrared divergence in the number
equations is shown both numerically and analytically, through a study of the
long-wavelength and low-energy limit of the pair fluctuation density. Besides
the pseudogap temperature, also the pair formation temperature and the critical
temperature for superfluidity are derived. The latter corresponds to the
Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature. The pseudogap temperature,
which coincides with the pair formation temperature in mean field, is found to
be suppressed with respect to the pair formation temperature by fluctuations.
This suppression is strongest for large binding energies of the pairs. Finally,
we investigate how the pair formation temperature, the pseudogap temperature
and the BKT temperature behave as a function of both binding energy and
imbalance between the pairing partners in the Fermi gas. This allows to set up
phase diagrams for the two-dimensional Fermi gas, in which the superfluid
phase, the phase-fluctuating quasicondensate, and the normal state can be

derived a two-qubit Bell inequality, $I_{CH3}$, which they show to be maximally
violated only when more general positive operator valued measures (POVMs) are
used instead of the usual von Neumann measurements. Here we consider a general
parametrization for the three-element-POVM involved in the Bell test and obtain
a higher quantum bound for the $I_{CH3}$-inequality. With a higher quantum
bound for $I_{CH3}$, we investigate if there is an experimental setup that can
be used for observing that POVMs give higher violations in Bell tests based on
this inequality. We analyze the maximum errors supported by the inequality to
identify a source of entangled photons that can be used for the test. Then, we
study if POVMs are also relevant in the more realistic case that partially
entangled states are used in the experiment. Finally, we investigate which are
the required efficiencies of the $I_{CH3}$-inequality, and the type of
measurements involved, for closing the detection loophole. We obtain that POVMs
allow for the lowest threshold detection efficiency, and that it is comparable
to the minimal (in the case of two-qubits) required detection efficiency of the
Clauser-Horne-Bell-inequality.

diffusion $X$ is analyzed by means of variational techniques. The diffusion is
driven by a SDE on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ with a non-linear diffusion
coefficient $\sigma(X)$ and a generic unbounded operator $A$ in the drift term.
When the gain function $\Theta$ is time-dependent and fulfils mild regularity
assumptions, the value function $\mathcal{U}$ of the optimal stopping problem
is shown to solve an infinite-dimensional, parabolic, degenerate variational
inequality on an unbounded domain. Once the coefficient $\sigma(X)$ is

Banach space $\mathcal{V}$ fully characterized in terms of a Gaussian measure
$\mu$.

Bensoussan and Lions \cite{Ben-Lio82}, of well-known results on optimal

may be useful in several fields, as in mathematical finance when pricing

variations in incoming stellar flux between periapse and apoapse. These
variations may lead to large swings in atmospheric temperature, which in turn
may cause changes in the chemistry of the atmosphere from higher CO abundances
at periapse to higher CH4 abundances at apoapse. Here we examine chemical
timescales for CO<->CH4 interconversion compared to orbital timescales and
vertical mixing timescales for the highly eccentric exoplanets HAT-P-2b and
CoRoT-10b. As exoplanet atmospheres cool, the chemical timescales for CO<->CH4
tend to exceed orbital and/or vertical mixing timescales, leading to quenching.
The relative roles of orbit-induced thermal quenching and vertical quenching
depend upon mixing timescales relative to orbital timescales. For both HAT-P-2b
and CoRoT-10b, vertical quenching will determine disequilibrium CO<->CH4
chemistry at faster vertical mixing rates (Kzz > 10^7 cm^2 s^-1), whereas
orbit-induced thermal quenching may play a significant role at slower mixing
rates (Kzz < 10^7 cm^2 s^-1). The general abundance and chemical timescale
results - calculated as a function of pressure, temperature, and metallicity -
can be applied for different atmospheric profiles in order to estimate the
quench level and disequilibrium abundances of CO and CH4 on hydrogen-dominated
exoplanets. Observations of CO and CH4 on highly eccentric exoplanets may yield
important clues to the chemical and dynamical properties of their atmospheres.

  energy, lambda",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main argument that Universe is currently expanding is observed redshift
increase by distance. However, this conclusion may not be correct, because
cosmological redshift depends only on the scaling factors, the change in the
size of the universe during the time of light propagation and is not related to
the speed of observer or speed of the object emitting the light. An observer in
expanding universe will measure the same redshift as observer in contracting
universe with the same scaling. This was not taken into account in analysing
the SN Ia data related to the universe acceleration. Possibility that universe
may contract, but that the observed light is cosmologically redshifted allows
for completely different set of cosmological parameters $\Omega_M,
\Omega_{\Lambda}$, including the solution $\Omega_M=1, \Omega_{\Lambda}=0$. The
contracting and in the same time accelerating universe explains observed
deceleration and acceleration in SN Ia data, but also gives significantly
larger value for the age of the universe, $t_0 = 24$ Gyr. This allows to
reconsider classical cosmological models with $\Lambda =0$. The contracting
stage also may explain the observed association of high redshifted quasars to
low redshifted galaxies.

universe is very high. This model, the big-bang, is now overwhelmingly present
in almost all aspects of society. It is the main stream cosmology of today. A
small number of scientists are researching on the possibility of a
non-expanding universe. The existence of these two groups, one very large and
the other very small, is a good proof of the use of the scientific method: it
does not drive to an absolute certainty. All models have to be permanently
validated, falsified. Ockham's razor, a powerful philosophical tool, will
probably change the amount of scientists working in each of these groups. We
present here a model where a big-bang is unnecessary. It ends, in a finite
time, in a second INFLATION, or a disaggregation to infinity. We also discuss
the possibilities of a non-expanding universe model. Only a few references will
be cited, mainly concerned with our own work in the past, thus purposely
avoiding citing the many thousands of professionals working in this field.

demonstrated that during the matter dominated era the large frequency
oscillations of the effective dark energy may influence the behavior of higher
derivatives of the Hubble parameter with the risk to produce some singular
unphysical solutions at high redshift. This behavior is explicitly analyzed for
realistic $F(R)$ models, in particular, exponential gravity and a power form
model. To stabilize such oscillations, we consider the additional modification
of the models via a correction term which does not destroy the viability
properties. A detailed analysis on the future evolution of the universe and the
evolution history of the growth index of the matter density perturbations are
performed. Furthermore, we explore two applications of exponential gravity to
the inflationary scenario. We show how it is possible to obtain different
numbers of $e$-folds during the early-time acceleration by making different
choices of the model parameters in the presence of ultrarelativistic matter,
which destabilizes inflation and eventually leads to the exit from the
inflationary stage. We execute the numerical analysis of inflation in two
viable exponential gravity models. It is proved that at the end of the
inflation, the effective energy density and curvature of the universe decrease
and thus a unified description between inflation and the $\Lambda$CDM-like dark
energy dominated era can be realized.

BuB is characterized by the fact that the beneficiaries of the networks

beneficiaries, this represent a paradigm shift from a consumer-only position to
an active-participant position. We summarize a representative set of the BuB
pilot proposals that have been considered in the context of the C4EU project. A
selection of these proposals will be executed and carefully documented to
define good practices in BuB deployments. The documentation will include
project templates, work plans, case studies, replicable success models and
regulatory guidelines. The overall goal of the project is to assess the
validity of the BuB model to effectively and efficiently complement exiting
traditional deployments in satisfying the networking and technological needs of
the European citizens and organizations.

morphological computing support Andrew Hodges' view of Turing as a natural
philosopher. Turing's natural philosophy differs importantly from Galileo's
view that the book of nature is written in the language of mathematics (The
Assayer, 1623). Computing is more than a language of nature as computation
produces real time physical behaviors. This article presents the framework of
Natural Info-computationalism as a contemporary natural philosophy that builds
on the legacy of Turing's computationalism. Info-computationalism is a
synthesis of Informational Structural Realism (the view that nature is a web of
informational structures) and Natural Computationalism (the view that nature
physically computes its own time development). It presents a framework for the
development of a unified approach to nature, with common interpretation of
inanimate nature as well as living organisms and their social networks.
Computing is understood as information processing that drives all the changes
on different levels of organization of information and can be modeled as
morphological computing on data sets pertinent to informational structures. The
use of infocomputational conceptualizations, models and tools makes possible
for the first time in history the study of complex selforganizing adaptive
systems, including basic characteristics and functions of living systems,
intelligence, and cognition.

breaking of an open type I string into two strings generates a nascent brane at
the new endpoints with inflationary cosmologies. This was left as a conjecture
at the end of this paper on the role of quantum critical points in the onset of
inflationary cosmology. The noncommutative geometry of the clock and lapse
functions for the AdS-brane are derived as is the number of degrees of freedom
which appear. The role of the AdS spacetime, or in particular its boundary, in

cosmological constant on the boundary. This is compared to schemes of conformal

Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric and its application to cosmology,
specifically addressing the question: What is the proper size of the visible
universe? There are several ways of answering the question of size, though
often with an incomplete understanding of how far light has actually traveled
in reaching us today from the most remote sources. The difficulty usually
arises from an inconsistent use of the coordinates, or an over-interpretation
of the physical meaning of quantities such as the so-called proper distance
R(t)=a(t)r, written in terms of the (unchanging) co-moving radius r and the
universal expansion factor a(t). In this paper, we use the five non-trivial FRW
metrics with constant spacetime curvature (i.e., the static FRW metrics, but
excluding Minkowski) to prove that in static FRW spacetimes in which expansion
began from an initial signularity, the visible universe today has a proper size
equal to R_h(t_0/2), i.e., the gravitational horizon at half its current age.
The exceptions are de Sitter and Lanczos, whose contents had pre-existing
positions away from the origin. In so doing, we confirm earlier results showing
the same phenomenon in a broad range of cosmologies, including LCDM, based on
the numerical integration of null geodesic equations through an FRW metric.
