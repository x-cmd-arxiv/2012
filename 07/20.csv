surface by using ab-initio transport theory. In the presence of a strong
surface perturbation we obtain standing-wave states resulting from the
superposition of spin-polarized surface states. By Fourier analysis, we
identify the underlying two dimensional scattering processes and the spin
texture. We find evidence of resonant transmission across surface barriers at
quantum well states energies and evaluate their lifetimes. Our results are in
excellent agreement with experimental findings. We also show that despite the
presence of a step edge along a different high symmetry direction, not yet
probed experimentally, the surface states exhibit unperturbed transmission
around the Fermi energy for states with near to normal incidence.

thermal state changes in their associated accretion discs. The observed
outbursts are connected to the strong variation in disc opacity as hydrogen
ionises near 5000 K. This physics leads to accretion disc models that exhibit
bistability and thermal limit cycles, whereby the disc jumps between a family
of cool and low accreting states and a family of hot and efficiently accreting
states. Previous models have parametrised the disc turbulence via an alpha (or
`eddy') viscosity. In this paper we treat the turbulence more realistically via
a suite of numerical simulations of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in
local geometry. Radiative cooling is included via a simple but physically
motivated prescription. We show the existence of bistable equilibria and thus
the prospect of thermal limit cycles, and in so doing demonstrate that
MRI-induced turbulence is compatible with the classical theory. Our simulations
also show that the turbulent stress and pressure perturbations are only weakly
dependent on each other on orbital times; as a consequence, thermal instability
connected to variations in turbulent heating (as opposed to radiative cooling)
is unlikely to operate, in agreement with previous numerical results. Our work
presents a first step towards unifying simulations of full MHD turbulence with
the correct thermal and radiative physics of the outbursting discs associated
with dwarf novae, low-mass X-ray binaries, and possibly young stellar objects.

rays (CR), are believed to maintain an average CR spectrum by diffusive shock
acceleration (DSA) regardless of the way they release CRs into the interstellar
medium (ISM). However, the interaction of the CRs with nearby gas clouds
crucially depends on the release mechanism. We call into question two aspects
of a popular paradigm of the CR injection into the ISM, according to which they
passively and isotropically diffuse in the prescribed magnetic fluctuations as
test particles. First, we treat the escaping CR and the Alfven waves excited by
them on an equal footing. Second, we adopt field aligned CR escape outside the
source, where the waves become weak. An exact analytic self-similar solution
for a CR ""cloud"" released by a dimmed accelerator strongly deviates from the
test-particle result. The CR diffusion coefficient $D_{NL}$ is strongly
suppressed compared to its background ISM value $D_{ISM}$: $D_{NL}\sim
D_{ISM}\exp(-\Pi)<< D_{ISM}$ for sufficiently high field-line-integrated CR
partial pressure, $\Pi$. When $\Pi>>1$, the CRs drive Alfven waves efficiently
enough to build a transport barrier that strongly reduces the leakage. The
solution has a spectral break at $p=p_{br}$, where $p_{br}$ satisfies the
following equation $D_{NL}(p_{br})\simeq z^{2}/t$.

formation using these objects as tracers, and established their importance in
defining the cosmic distance scale. We intend to derive a new calibration of

GCs in M31 in the HST archive. We collected the BVI data for 48 old GCs in M31
and analysed them by applying the same methods and procedures to all objects.
We obtained a set of homogeneous colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) that were
best-fitted with the fiducial CMD ridge lines of selected Milky Way template
GCs. Reddening, metallicity, Horizontal Branch (HB) luminosity and distance
were determined self-consistently for each cluster. There are three main
results of this study: i) the relation
M_V(HB)=(0.25+/-0.02)[Fe/H]+(0.89+/-0.03), which is obtained from the above
parameters and is calibrated on the distances of the template Galactic GCs; ii)
the distance modulus to M31 of (m-M)_0=24.42+/-0.06 mag, obtained by
normalising this relation at the reference value of [Fe/H]=-1.5 to a similar
relation using V_0(HB). This is the first determination of the distance to M31
based on the characteristics of its GC system which is calibrated on Galactic
GCs; iii) the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), which is estimated
to be 18.54+/-0.07 mag as a consequence of the previous results. These values
agree excellently with the most recent estimate based on HST parallaxes of
Galactic Cepheid and RR Lyrae stars, as well as with recent methods.

which characterizes the quantum adiabatic time for the evolution of a quantum

linear combination of two given initial and final Hamilton operators, i.e.
$\mathbf{H}(s) = (1-s)\mathbf{H_0} + s\mathbf{H_1}$. Informally, the quantum
adiabatic time of a quantum system specifies the speed at which the Hamiltonian
operators changes so that the ground state of the system at any time $s$ will

stopping time with a finite $L^1$-distance to $\theta$, whereas if $\theta$ has
finite mean it is either optimal to stop immediately or to stop when the
process reflected in its supremum exceeds a positive level, depending on
whether the median of the law of the ultimate supremum equals zero or is
positive. Furthermore, pasting properties are derived. Finally, the result is
made more explicit in terms of scale functions in the case when the L\'evy

essential features of living systems. Life without flow is death and so a
different approach is needed to study biology alive. The theory of complex
fluids deals with interactions, boundary conditions, and flows quite well as
can be seen in its successful treatment of liquid crystals. I advocate treating
ionic solutions in general as complex fluids, with microelements that are the
solutes and components of the solution. Enzyme active sites are a special case
where some solutes are reactants. Solutes are crowded into active sites of
enzyme by the high density of protein charges. The electric field links
chemical reactions to charges in the protein and surrounding solutions.
Interactions potentiate catalysis and control biological function. I suspect
that most chemical reactions that occur in liquids also need to be treated by
the theory of complex fluids. The electron movements of these reactions occur
in a temporary highly concentrated fluctuation, a transient spatial
inhomogeneity in the bulk solution. The electron movements of these reactions
(described by quantum mechanics) are coupled to the electric (and sometimes
steric) fields of the bulk solution. I suspect the electron movements,
inhomogeneities, and chemical reaction (in the condensed phase) need to be

reconstruct clustering using a significantly reduced set of pairwise

  the Outer Kuiper Belt have a Future?","18 pages, including 7 figures, 5 pages of tables",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It often seems as though papers bearing titles in the form of a question end
with ambiguous answers. Here the situation is different: the outer Kuiper belt
does have a definite future, although one of uncertain duration. Simulations
provide two distinct, compelling reasons. First, mean motion resonances in the
outer belt [i.e., beyond the 1/2 resonance at 47.76 AU] are amazingly ""sticky"":
in almost all cases bodies captured in them from regions closer to Neptune
during that planet's outward migration remain trapped for 4.6 byr. Most
captured orbits are chaotic and so will eventually escape, but there is no
reason to believe that all outer belt resonances will empty in the near future.
Second, in determining capture probabilities for various resonances, we find
that the first order 1/2 resonance is quite efficient, but, in clear contrast
to higher order ones in the outer belt, nearly half of its victims have escaped
during 4.6 byr. These bodies typically remain in unstable orbits in the outer
belt, usually for several hundred million years before being expelled well
beyond 100 AU. Other inner belt resonances, although capturing less efficiently
than 1/2, behave in the same fashion. Thus the outer belt has a two component,
long-term population: one with members lying semi-permanently in one of about 6
resonances and another that is far more temporary, but whose source provides a
continuous and ready resupply. The resulting eccentricity distribution of this
combined population closely matches the observed one, as Hahn and Malhotra have
made clear but the inclination distribution is a better approximation to it
than is often claimed, a fact that probably should not be ignored when
considering an origin for what has been labeled ""the scattered disk"".

with a buffer, and a destination. We assume that the direct source-destination
link is not available and all links undergo fading. We propose two new
buffer-aided relaying schemes. In the first scheme, neither the source nor the
relay have CSIT, and consequently, both nodes are forced to transmit with fixed
rates. In contrast, in the second scheme, the source does not have CSIT and
transmits with fixed rate but the relay has CSIT and adapts its transmission
rate accordingly. In the absence of delay constraints, for both fixed rate and
mixed rate transmission, we derive the throughput-optimal buffer-aided relaying
protocols which select either the source or the relay for transmission based on
the instantaneous SNRs of the source-relay and the relay-destination links. In
addition, for the delay constrained case, we develop buffer-aided relaying
protocols that achieve a predefined average delay. Compared to conventional
relaying protocols, which select the transmitting node according to a
predefined schedule independent of the link instantaneous SNRs, the proposed
buffer-aided protocols with adaptive link selection achieve large performance
gains. In particular, for fixed rate transmission, we show that the proposed
protocol achieves a diversity gain of two as long as an average delay of more
than three time slots can be afforded. Furthermore, for mixed rate transmission
with an average delay of $E{T}$ time slots, a multiplexing gain of
$r=1-1/(2E{T})$ is achieved. Hence, for mixed rate transmission, for
sufficiently large average delays, buffer-aided half-duplex relaying with and
without adaptive link selection does not suffer from a multiplexing gain loss
compared to full-duplex relaying.

contamination by taking advantage of a procedure which makes use of variable

eliminate stochastic effects in the cluster CMDs caused by the presence of
isolated bright stars, as well as, to make a finer cleaning in the most

composite stellar populations of the SMC field. Finally, we used the spatial

luminosity or in detectors with coarse calorimeter segmentation, the overlaps
of calorimeter energy deposits from charged and neutral particles significantly
complicate particle energy reconstruction, reducing the overall energy
resolution of the method. We present a technique designed to resolve
overlapping energy depositions of spatially close particles using a
statistically consistent probabilistic procedure. The technique is nearly free
of ad-hoc corrections, improves energy resolution, and provides new important
handles that can improve the sensitivity of physics analyses: the uncertainty
of the jet energy on an event-by-event basis and the estimate of the
probability of a given particle hypothesis for a given detector response. When
applied to the reconstruction of hadronic jets produced in the decays of tau
leptons using the CDF-II detector at Fermilab, the method has demonstrated
reliable and robust performance.

Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS). We consider how SN systematic errors affect
constraints from combined SN Ia, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), and cosmic
microwave background (CMB) data, given that SNe Ia still provide the strongest
constraints on DE but are arguably subject to more significant systematics than
the latter two probes. We focus our attention on the temporal evolution of DE
described in terms of principal components (PCs) of the equation of state,
though we examine a few of the more common, simpler parametrizations as well.
We find that the SN Ia systematics degrade the total generalized figure of
merit (FoM), which characterizes constraints in multi-dimensional DE parameter
space, by a factor of two to three. Nevertheless, overall constraints obtained
on more than five PCs are very good even with current data and systematics. We
further show that current constraints are robust to allowing for the finite
detection significance of the BAO feature in galaxy surveys.

most matrices X, where X is chosen from the Gaussian ensemble (the matrix
entries are i.i.d. univariate complex Gaussians). Can we test that the oracle
satisfies this claim? This paper gives a polynomial-time algorithm for the
task. The oracle-testing problem is of interest because a recent paper of
Aaronson and Arkhipov showed that if there is a polynomial-time algorithm for
simulating boson-boson interactions in quantum mechanics, then an approximation
oracle for the permanent (of the type described above) exists in BPP^NP. Since
computing the permanent of even 0/1 matrices is #P-complete, this seems to
demonstrate more computational power in quantum mechanics than Shor's factoring
algorithm does. However, unlike factoring, which is in NP, it was unclear
previously how to test the correctness of an approximation oracle for the
permanent, and this is the contribution of the paper. The technical difficulty
overcome here is that univariate polynomial self-correction, which underlies
similar oracle-testing algorithms for permanent over finite fields --- and
whose discovery led to a revolution in complexity theory --- does not seem to
generalize to complex (or even, real) numbers. We believe that this tester will
motivate further progress on understanding the permanent of Gaussian matrices.

sequence galaxy population, comparing with models of possible star formation

(z < 1), these data are clearly inconsistent with the continued evolution of

Specifically, we find that the colors of massive cluster galaxies at z = 1.5

colors imply formation at z ~ 2; therefore these galaxies exhibit approximately
the same luminosity-weighted stellar age at 1 < z < 1.5. This likely reflects
star formation that occurs over an extended period, the effects of significant
progenitor bias, or both. Our results generally indicate that massive cluster
galaxy populations began forming a significant mass of stars at z >~ 4,
contained some red spheroids by z ~ 1.5, and were actively assembling much of
their final mass during 1 < z < 2 in the form of younger stars. Qualitatively,
the slopes of the cluster color-magnitude relations are consistent with no
significant evolution relative to local clusters.

and robust measurements of star formation rates and gas-phase metallicities. We
match the galaxies in total stellar mass, redshift, and local density to a set
of 10 control galaxies per pair galaxy. For each pair galaxy we can therefore
calculate the statistical change in star formation rate (SFR) and metallicity
associated with the interaction process. Relative to the control sample, we
find that galaxies in pairs show typical SFR enhancements that are, on average,
60% higher than the control sample at rp < 30 kpc/h. In addition, the pairs
demonstrate more modest SFR enhancements of ~30% out to at least 80 kpc/h (the
widest separations in our sample). Galaxies in both major and minor mergers
show significant SFR enhancements at all rp, although the strongest starbursts
(with SFR enhancements of a factor of ~10) appear to be found only in the major
mergers. For the first time, we are also able to trace the metallicity changes
in galaxy pairs as a function of projected separation. The metallicity is
generally diluted in galaxy pairs by ~0.02 dex, with an average metallicity
decrement of -0.03 dex at the smallest separations. The SFR and metallicity
trends with projected separation are interpreted through a comparison with
theoretical models. These simulations indicate that the peak in SFR
enhancements at small separations is due to systems near the end of the merger
process. The extended plateau in SFR enhancements out to at least 80 kpc/h is
dominated by galaxies that have made a pericentric passage and are now
experiencing triggered star formation on their trajectory towards
apogalacticon, or on a subsequent close approach. (Abridged)

an enormous amount of research into the properties of BiFeO$_3$. Nonetheless,
one of the most fundamental aspects of this material, namely the symmetries of
the lattice vibrations, remains controversial.We present a comprehensive Raman
study of BiFeO$_3$ single crystals with the approach of monitoring the Raman

method results in unambiguous assignment of the phonon symmetries and explains
the origin of the controversy in the literature. Furthermore, it provides
access to the Raman tensor elements enabling direct comparison with theoretical
calculations. Hence, this allows the study of symmetry breaking and coupling
mechanisms in a wide range of complex materials and may lead to a noninvasive,
all-optical method to determine the orientation and magnitude of the

  Figures, 2 Tables",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new paradigm for finite precision iterative decoding on
low-density parity-check codes over the Binary Symmetric channel. The messages
take values from a finite alphabet, and unlike traditional quantized decoders
which are quantized versions of the Belief propagation (BP) decoder, the
proposed finite alphabet iterative decoders (FAIDs) do not propagate quantized
probabilities or log-likelihoods and the variable node update functions do not
mimic the BP decoder. Rather, the update functions are maps designed using the
knowledge of potentially harmful subgraphs that could be present in a given
code, thereby rendering these decoders capable of outperforming the BP in the
error floor region. On certain column-weight-three codes of practical interest,
we show that there exist 3-bit precision FAIDs that surpass the BP decoder in
the error floor. Hence, FAIDs are able to achieve a superior performance at
much lower complexity. We also provide a methodology for the selection of FAIDs
that is not code-specific, but gives a set of candidate FAIDs containing
potentially good decoders in the error floor region for any column-weight-three
code. We validate the code generality of our methodology by providing
particularly good three-bit precision FAIDs for a variety of codes with
different rates and lengths.

that makes life so distinctive and remarkable, there is general agreement that
its informational aspect is one key property, perhaps the key property. The
unique informational narrative of living systems suggests that life may be
characterized by context-dependent causal influences, and in particular, that
top-down (or downward) causation -- where higher-levels influence and constrain
the dynamics of lower-levels in organizational hierarchies -- may be a major
contributor to the hierarchal structure of living systems. Here we propose that
the origin of life may correspond to a physical transition associated with a
shift in causal structure, where information gains direct, and
context-dependent causal efficacy over the matter it is instantiated in. Such a
transition may be akin to more traditional physical transitions (e.g.
thermodynamic phase transitions), with the crucial distinction that determining
which phase (non-life or life) a given system is in requires dynamical
information and therefore can only be inferred by identifying causal
architecture. We discuss some potential novel research directions based on this
hypothesis, including potential measures of such a transition that may be
amenable to laboratory study, and how the proposed mechanism corresponds to the
onset of the unique mode of (algorithmic) information processing characteristic
of living systems.

proposed scheme uses a plurality of FAIDs which collectively correct more error
patterns than a single FAID on a given code. The collection of FAIDs utilized
by the scheme is judiciously chosen to ensure that individual decoders have
different decoding dynamics and correct different error patterns. Consequently,
they can collectively correct a diverse set of error patterns, which is
referred to as decoder diversity. We provide a systematic method to generate
the set of FAIDs for decoder diversity on a given code based on the knowledge
of the most harmful trapping sets present in the code. Using the well-known
column-weight-three $(155,64)$ Tanner code with $d_{min}$ = 20 as an example,

automorphism group of an exponential family or a graphical model, thus
formalizing the general notion of symmetry of a probabilistic model. This
automorphism group provides a precise mathematical framework for lifted
inference in the general exponential family. Its group action partitions the
set of random variables and feature functions into equivalent classes (called
orbits) having identical marginals and expectations. Then the inference problem
is effectively reduced to that of computing marginals or expectations for each
class, thus avoiding the need to deal with each individual variable or feature.
We demonstrate the usefulness of this general framework in lifting two classes
of variational approximation for MAP inference: local LP relaxation and local
LP relaxation with cycle constraints; the latter yields the first lifted
inference that operate on a bound tighter than local constraints. Initial
experimental results demonstrate that lifted MAP inference with cycle
constraints achieved the state of the art performance, obtaining much better
objective function values than local approximation while remaining relatively
efficient.

gas mass of 54 Msun and a dynamical timescale of 8,000 yr. The kinematics of
the HMC is probed by high-excitation CH3OH and CH3CN lines, which are detected
at sub-arcsecond resolution and unveil a velocity gradient perpendicular to the
outflow axis, suggesting a disk-like rotation of the HMC. An infalling envelope
around the HMC is evidenced by CN lines exhibiting a profound inverse P-Cygni
profile, and the estimated mass infall rate, 1.5x10^{-3} Msun/yr, is well
comparable to that inferred from the mass outflow rate. A more detailed
investigation of the kinematics of the dense gas around the HMC is obtained
from the 13CO and C18O (2--1) lines; the position-velocity diagrams of the two

which reconnection at a current sheet releases and dissipates free magnetic
energy. We find that only a small fraction (3%-11% depending on current sheet
size) of the energy is stored close enough to the current sheet to be
dissipated abruptly by the reconnection process. The remaining energy, stored
in the larger-scale field, is converted to kinetic energy in a fast
magnetosonic disturbance propagating away from the reconnection site, carrying
the initial current and generating reconnection-associated flows (inflow and
outflow). Some of this reflects from the lower boundary (the photosphere) and
refracts back to the X-point reconnection site. Most of this inward wave energy
is reflected back again, and continues to bounce between X-point and
photosphere until it is gradually dissipated, over many transits. This phase of
the energy dissipation process is thus global and lasts far longer than the
initial purely local phase. In the process a significant fraction of the energy
(25%-60%) remains as undissipated fast magnetosonic waves propagating away from
the reconnection site, primarily upward. This flare-generated wave is initiated
by unbalanced Lorentz forces in the reconnection-disrupted current sheet,
rather than by dissipation-generated pressure, as some previous models have
assumed. Depending on the orientation of the initial current sheet the wave

machines within organisations are termed workstation-based. Workstation-based
systems are characterised by dynamically changing sets of machines that are
used primarily for other, user-centric tasks. They must be able to adapt to and
utilize spare capacity when and where it is available, and ensure that the
non-availability of an individual machine does not affect the availability of
the system. This thesis focuses on the requirements and design of a
workstation-based database system, which is motivated by an analysis of
existing database architectures that are typically run over static, specially
provisioned sets of machines. A typical clustered database system -- one that
is run over a number of specially provisioned machines -- executes queries
interactively, returning a synchronous response to applications, with its data
made durable and resilient to the failure of machines. There are no existing
workstation-based databases. Furthermore, other workstation-based systems do
not attempt to achieve the requirements of interactivity and durability,
because they are typically used to execute asynchronous batch processing jobs
that tolerate data loss -- results can be re-computed. These systems use
external servers to store the final results of computations rather than
workstation machines. This thesis describes the design and implementation of a
workstation-based database system and investigates its viability by evaluating
its performance against existing clustered database systems and testing its
availability during machine failures.

report, we show that graph sampling algorithms currently proposed in the

new sampling algorithm, called Tiny Sample Extractor, with a new goal of a
sample size smaller than 5% of the original graph while preserving two key
properties of a network, the degree distribution and its clustering
co-efficient. Our approach is based on a new empirical method of estimating
measurement biases in crawling algorithms and compensating for them
accordingly. We present a detailed comparison of best known graph sampling
algorithms, focusing in particular on how the properties of the sample
subgraphs converge to those of the original graph as they grow. These results
show that our sampling algorithm extracts a smaller subgraph than other
algorithms while also achieving a closer convergence to the degree
distribution, measured by the degree exponent, of the original graph. The
subgraph generated by the Tiny Sample Extractor, however, is not necessarily
representative of the full graph with regard to other properties such as
assortativity. This indicates that the problem of extracting a truly
representative small subgraph from a large graph remains unsolved.

investigations of air shower phenomena and their experimental skill laid the

Soon interests focussed on the highest energies requiring much larger detectors
to be operated. The first detection of air fluorescence light by Japanese and
US groups in the early 1970s marked an important experimental breakthrough
towards this end as it allowed huge volumes of atmosphere to be monitored by
optical telescopes. Radio observations of air showers, pioneered in the 1960s,
are presently experiencing a renaissance and may revolutionise the field again.

galaxy's disk and is therefore crucial to our understanding of galaxy
evolution. In this review, we summarize the multi-wavelength observational
properties and origin models of Galactic and low redshift spiral galaxy halo
gas. Galactic halos contain multiphase gas flows that are dominated in mass by
the ionized component and extend to large radii. The densest, coldest halo gas
observed in neutral hydrogen (HI) is generally closest to the disk (< 20 kpc),
and absorption line results indicate warm and warm-hot diffuse halo gas is
present throughout a galaxy's halo. The hot halo gas detected is not a
significant fraction of a galaxy's baryons. The disk-halo interface is where
the multiphase flows are integrated into the star forming disk, and there is
evidence for both feedback and fueling at this interface from the temperature
and kinematic gradient of the gas and HI structures. The origin and fate of
halo gas is considered in the context of cosmological and idealized local
simulations. Accretion along cosmic filaments occurs in both a hot (> 10^5.5 K)
and cold mode in simulations, with the compressed material close to the disk
the coldest and densest, in agreement with observations. There is evidence in
halo gas observations for radiative and mechanical feedback mechanisms,
including escaping photons from the disk, supernova-driven winds, and a
galactic fountain. Satellite accretion also leaves behind abundant halo gas.
This satellite gas interacts with the existing halo medium, and much of this
gas will become part of the diffuse halo before it can reach the disk. The
accretion rate from cold and warm halo gas is generally below a galaxy disk's
star formation rate, but gas at the disk-halo interface and stellar feedback
may be important additional fuel sources.

brings together a model of individual behavior based on brain function with a
model of how the behavior of an individual is controlled by the individual's
perception of the social context they find themselves in. This control process
is the process I refer to as ""framing"". In the paper I give three experiments
that the reader can carry out for themselves that illustrate the basic
principles of the framework. I then discuss a number of specific examples
showing how framing can have powerful effects leading to context dependence and
cultural responses at a variety of levels and grain sizes. One such is the
impact of differences between the epistemological stances of physics and
biology on the creation of a reformed physics class for biology students.

that the NLO QCD corrections at the $\sqrt{s}=14 TeV$ LHC can obviously reduce

matter like strange quark matter or color superconducting matter. Stars also
can have a quark core surrounded by hadronic matter, known as hybrid stars
(HS). The HS is likely to have a mixed phase in between the hadron and quark
phase. Observational results suggest huge surface magnetic field in certain
neutron stars (NS) called magnetars. Here we study the effect of strong
magnetic field on the respective EOS of matter under extreme conditions. We
further study the hadron-quark phase transition in the interiors of NS giving
rise to hybrid stars (HS) in presence of strong magnetic field. The hadronic
matter EOS is described based on relativistic mean field theory and we include
the effect of strong magnetic fields leading to Landau quantization of the
charged particles. For the quark phase we use the simple MIT bag model. We
assume density dependent bag pressure and magnetic field. The magnetic field
strength increases going from the surface to the center of the star. We
construct the intermediate mixed phase using Glendenning conjecture. The
magnetic field softens the EOS of both the matter phases. The effect of
magnetic field is insignificant unless the field strength is above $10^{14}$G.
A varying magnetic field, with surface field strength of $10^{14}$G and the
central field strength of the order of $10^{17}$G has significant effect on
both the stiffness and the mixed phase regime of the EOS. We finally study the
mass-radius relationship for such type of mixed HS, calculating their maximum
mass, and compare them with the recent observation of pulsar PSR J1614-2230,
which is about 2 solar mass. The observations puts a severe constraint on the
EOS of matter at extreme conditions. The maximum mass with our EOS can reach
the limit set by the observation.

spatial variation over the Monoceros SNR, and study its properties of evolution
within the complex interstellar medium. We extracted radio continuum data for
the Monoceros complex region from the Effelsberg 21 cm and 11 cm surveys and
the Urumqi 6 cm polarization survey. We used the new Arecibo GALFA-HI survey
data with much higher resolution and sensitivity than that previously available
to identify the HI shell related with the SNR. Multi-wavelengths data are
included to investigate the properties of the SNR. The spectral index $\alpha$
($S_{\nu}\propto\nu^{\alpha}$) averaged over the SNR is $-0.41 \pm$0.16. The
TT-plots and the distribution of $\alpha$ over the SNR show spatial variations
which steepen towards the inner western filamentary shell. Polarized emission
is prominent on the western filamentary shell region. The RM there is estimated
to be about 30$\pm$77n rad m$^{-2}$, where the n=1 solution is preferred, and
the magnetic field has a strength of about 9.5 $\mu$G. From the HI channel
maps, further evidence is provided for an interaction between the Monoceros SNR
and the Rosette Nebula. We identify partial neutral hydrogen shell structures
in the northwestern region at LSR velocities of +15 km s$^{-1}$ circumscribing
the continuum emission. The HI shell has swept up a mass of about 4000
M$_{\odot}$ for a distance of 1.6 kpc. The western HI shell, well associated
with the dust mission, is found to lie outside of the radio shell. We suggest
that the Monoceros SNR is evolving within a cavity blown-out by the progenitor,
and has triggered part of the star formation in the Rosette Nebula.

covering various phases - pre-maximum, early decline and nebular - during the
first 10 months of its discovery followed by limited observations in early part
of 2011 April. The spectra follow the evolution of the nova when the lines had
strong P Cygni profiles to a phase dominated by prominent emission lines. The
notable feature of the near-IR spectra in the early decline phase is the rare
presence of first overtone bands of carbon monoxide in emission. Later about
150 days after the peak brightness the IR spectra show clear dust formation in
the expanding ejecta. Dust formation in V496 Sct is consistent with the
presence of lines of elements with low ionization potentials like Na and Mg in
the early spectra and the detection of CO bands in emission. The light curve
shows a slow rise to the maximum and a slow decline indicating a prolonged mass
loss. This is corroborated by the strengthening of P Cygni profiles during the
first 30 days. In the spectra taken close to the optical maximum brightness,
the broad and single absorption component seen at the time of discovery is
replaced by two sharper components. During the early decline phase two sharp
dips that show increasing outflow velocities are seen in the P Cygni absorption
components of Fe II and H I lines. The spectra in 2010 March showed the onset
of the nebular phase. Several emission lines display saddle-like profiles
during the nebular phase. In the nebular stage the observed fluxes of [O III]

mass of the ejecta. The optical spectra show that the nova evolved in the P_fe
A_o spectral sequence. The physical conditions in the ejecta are estimated. The
absolute magnitude and the distance to the nova are estimated to be M_V = -7.0

maps where the domains delimited by the loops are given two alternating colors,
which can be assigned different local weights, hence allowing for an explicit
Z_2 domain symmetry breaking. Each loop receives a non local weight n, as well
as a local bending energy which controls loop turns. By a standard cluster
construction that we review, the Q = n^2 Potts model on general random maps is
mapped to a particular instance of this problem with domain-non-symmetric
weights. We derive in full generality a set of coupled functional relations for
a pair of generating series which encode the enumeration of loop configurations
on maps with a boundary of a given color, and solve it by extending well-known
complex analytic techniques. In the case where loops are fully-packed, we
analyze in details the phase diagram of the model and derive exact equations
for the position of its non-generic critical points. In particular, we
underline that the critical Potts model on general random maps is not self-dual
whenever Q \neq 1. In a model with domain-symmetric weights, we also show the
possibility of a spontaneous domain symmetry breaking driven by the bending

generally works to slow down the evolution of the field. On the other hand, if
the Galileon self-interaction is dominant relative to the standard kinetic
term, we show that there is no oscillatory regime of inflaton after the end of
inflation. This is typically accompanied by the appearance of the negative
propagation speed squared $c_s^2$ of a scalar mode, which leads to the
instability of small-scale perturbations. For chaotic inflation and natural
inflation we clarify the parameter space in which inflaton oscillates
coherently during reheating. Using the WMAP constraints of the scalar spectral
index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio as well, we find that the self coupling
$\lambda$ of the potential $V(\phi)=\lambda \phi^4/4$ is constrained to be very
much smaller than 1 and that the symmetry breaking scale $f$ of natural
inflation cannot be less than the reduced Planck mass $M_{\rm pl}$. We also
show that, in the presence of other covariant Galileon Lagrangians, there are
some cases in which inflaton oscillates coherently even for the self coupling
$\lambda$ of the order of 0.1, but still the instability associated with
negative $c_s^2$ is generally present.

possible in the local Universe, the above fractions increase to become 80% and
17%. We also find that absorption is a function of source luminosity, which
implies some evolution in the obscuration properties of AGN. Few peculiar
classes, so far poorly studied in the hard X-ray band, have been detected and
studied for the first time such as 5 XBONG, 5 type 2 QSOs and 11 LINERs. In
terms of optical classification, our sample contains 57% of type 1 and 43% of
type 2 AGN; this subdivision is similar to that found in X-rays if unabsorbed

optical and X-ray classification is overall good. Only a small percentage of
sources (12%) does not fulfill the expectation of the unified theory as we find
22 type 1 AGN which are absorbed and 10 type 2 AGN which are unabsorbed.
Studying in depth these outliers we found that most of the absorbed type 1 AGN
have X-ray spectra characterized by either complex or warm/ionized absorption
more likely due to ionized gas located in an accretion disk wind or in the
biconical structure associated to the central nucleus, therefore unrelated to

synchronization (CS) state in arrays of time-delay systems, where the systems
are coupled with instantaneous diffusive coupling. We demonstrate that the
transition to CS occurs distinctly for different coupling configurations. In
particular, for unidirectional coupling, locally (microscopically)
synchronization transition occurs in a very narrow range of coupling strength
but for a global one (macroscopically) it occurs sequentially in a broad range
of coupling strength preceded by an intermittent synchronization. On the other
hand, in the case of mutual coupling a very large value of coupling strength is
required for local synchronization and, consequently, all the local subsystems
synchronize immediately for the same value of the coupling strength and hence
globally synchronization also occurs in a narrow range of the coupling
strength. In the transition regime, we observe a new type of synchronization
transition where long intervals of high quality synchronization which are
interrupted at irregular times by intermittent chaotic bursts simultaneously in
all the systems, which we designate as global intermittent synchronization
(GIS). We also relate our synchronization transition results to the above
specific types using unstable periodic orbit theory. The above studies are
carried out in a well known piecewise linear time-delay system.

out polynomial kernels with respect to the distance to various classes of

the question whether there are nontrivial structural parameters for which

collection of graph reduction rules that are safe for Pathwidth. We analyze the
success of these results and obtain polynomial kernelizations with respect to

systematically to obtain insight into the errors that are introduced by various
common approximations such as describing cell growth and division by an
effective protein degradation term. In particular, we show that the population
average of protein content of a cell exhibits a subtle dependence on the
dynamics of growth and division, the specific model for volume growth and the
age structure of the population. Nevertheless, the error made by models with
implicit cell growth and division is quite small. Furthermore, we compare
various models that are partially stochastic to investigate the impact of
different sources of (intrinsic) noise. This comparison indicates that
different sources of noise (protein synthesis, partitioning in cell division)
contribute comparable amounts of noise if protein synthesis is not or only
weakly bursty. If protein synthesis is very bursty, the burstiness is the
dominant noise source, independent of other details of the model. Finally, we
discuss two sources of extrinsic noise: cell-to-cell variations in protein
content due to cells being at different stages in the division cycles, which we
show to be small (for the protein concentration and, surprisingly, also for the
protein copy number per cell) and fluctuations in the growth rate, which can
have a significant impact.

in-plane micro-resonators with Fabry-Perot, square, pentagon, stadium, disk,

is measured in each case. It is shown that although TE modes prevail generally
(P>0), kite-shaped micro-laser generates negative values for P, i.e. a flip of
the dominant polarization which becomes mostly TM polarized. We at last
investigated two degrees of freedom that are available to tailor the
polarization of organic lasers, in addition to the pump polarization and the
resonator geometry: upon using resonant energy transfer (RET) or upon pumping
the laser dye to an higher excited state. We then demonstrate that
significantly lower P factors can be obtained.

near-ultraviolet images obtained with galex, to explore how close the
morphology and scales of HI and UV in these disks correlate. We find that xuv
disks do not stand out by their effective radii in UV or HI. However, the
concentration index in FUV appears to select some xuv disks. And known xuv
disks can be identified via a criterion using Asymmetry and M20; 80% of xuv
disks are included but with 55% contamination. This translates into 61
candidate xuv disk out of our 266 galaxies, (23%) consistent with previous
findings. We consider three scenarios; tidal features from major mergers, the
typical extended Hi disk is a photo- dissociation product of the xuv regions
and both Hi and UV features originate in cold flows fueling the main galaxy. We
define extended HI and UV disks based on their concentration (CHI > 5 and CFUV
> 4 respectively), but note that these two subsamples never overlap in the
WHISP sample. This appears to discount a simple photo-dissociation origin of
the outer HI disk. Previously, we identified the morphology space occupied by
ongoing major mergers. Known xuv disks rarely reside in the merger dominated

solar-neighbourhood velocity distribution from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey. We
find that the disc's vertical density profile is in good agreement with data at
z<~500 pc. The thick-disc component of the distribution function is then used
to extend the fit to data from Gilmore & Reid (1983) for z<~2.5 kpc. The
resulting model predicts excellent fits to the profile of the vertical velocity
dispersion \sigma_z(z) from the RAVE survey and to the distribution of v_\phi
velocity components at |z|~1kpc from the SDSS survey. The ability of this model
to predict successfully data that was not used in the fitting process suggests
that the adopted gravitational potential (which is close to a maximum-disc
potential) is close to the true one. We show that if another plausible
potential is used, the predicted values of \sigma_z are too large. The models
imply that in contrast to the thin disc, the thick disc has to be hotter
vertically than radially, a prediction that it will be possible to test in the
near future. When the model parameters are adjusted in an unconstrained manner,
there is a tendency to produce models that predict unexpected radial variations
in quantities such as scale height. This finding suggests that to constrain
these models adequately one needs data that extends significantly beyond the
solar cylinder. The models presented in this paper might prove useful to the
interpretation of data for external galaxies that has been taken with an
integral field unit.

been a challenging obstacle, which telecommunication engineering is trying to
overcome. In second generation networks for example, this problem lies in the
fact that there are multiple standards. Each of these standards can operate in
the same frequency range. However, each utilizes a different Radio Technology
and Modulation Scheme, which are characteristics of the standard. Therefore,
the lack of interoperability in 2G occurs because of the lack of
standardization. Interoperability within 3G networks is limited to a few
operating modes using different Radio Transmission Technologies that are not
inter-operable. Thus, interoperability remains an issue for 3G. 4G technology
even being successful in its various trials cannot guarantee the
interoperability. This is within each network generation; meanwhile between
heterogeneous network generations the situation seems to be worst. This
approach is first to analyze the structure, inputs, and outputs of three
different cellular technologies, performing a domain analysis (of this subset
of technologies) and producing a feature model of the domain. Finally, we
sought to build an ontology capable of providing a common view of the domain,
providing an effective representation of relations between representations of
corresponding concepts in different cellular technologies.

distributions (SEDs) and our new $J$-band imaging and $H$- and $K_S$-band
imaging polarimetry obtained using the VLT/NACO instrument. Previous
observations expect an optically thick torus in the equatorial plane because of
a striking bipolar appearance and a large viewing angle of 30 - 40$\degr$.
However, models with such a torus as well as a bipolar lobe and an AGB shell
cannot fit the SED and the images simultaneously. We find that an additional
optically and geometrically thick disk located inside a massive torus solves
this problem. The masses of the disk and the torus are estimated to be 0.01
$M_{\sun}$ at the $a_\mathrm{max}=100 \mu$m dust and 1 $M_{\sun}$ at
$a_\mathrm{max}=10 \mu$m dust, respectively. We discuss a possible formation
scenario for the disk and torus based on a similar mechanism to the equatorial
back flow. IRAS 16342-3814 is expected to undergo mass loss at a high rate. The
radiation from the central star is shielded by the dust that was ejected in the
subsequent mass loss event. As a result, the radiation pressure on dust
particles cannot govern the motion of the particles anymore. The mass loss flow
can be concentrated in the equatorial plane by help of an interaction, which
might be the gravitational attraction by the companion, if it exists in IRAS

circum-binary disk and the remains are escaping from the central star(s) and

We find that, in accord with linear stability theory, the development of the

If the poloidal field significantly decreases outwards from the axis, the
initial small perturbations grow strongly, and if multiple wavelengths are
excited non-linear interaction eventually disrupts the initial cylindrical
configuration. When the profile of the poloidal field is shallow, the
instability develops slowly and eventually saturates. We briefly discuss

correlator; in agreement with previous work, we find that, in linear response,
interaction effects can be accounted for by an effective (renormalized)
transmission probability. Beyond linear response, simple renormalization of
scattering coefficients is not sufficient to describe the current-current
correlator, as additional corrections arise due to irreducible two-particle
processes. Furthermore, we find that the correlations between opposite-spin
currents induced by interaction are enhanced for an asymmetric scatterer,
generating a nonzero result already to lowest order in the interaction.

study how their SEDs differ from those of local and high-z analogs. Our mid-IR
flux-limited sample of 191 sources is unique in size, and spectral coverage,
including Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy. Here we add Herschel photometry at
250um, 350um, and 500um, which allows us to obtain accurate total IR
luminosities, as well as constrain the relative contributions of AGN and
starbursts to those luminosities. Our sample constitutes ~23% AGN (i.e. where
the AGN contributes >50% of L_IR), ~30% starbursts (where AGN contributes <20%
of L_IR and the mid-IR spectra are starburst-like); and ~47% composites (which
show both significant AGN and starburst activity). The AGN-dominated sources
divide into ones that show a strong silicate 9.7um absorption feature, implying
highly obscured systems, and ones that do not. The high-tau_9.7 sources are
half of our z>1.2 AGN, but show SEDs that are extremely rare among local AGN.
The SEDs of our z~2 starburst-dominated ULIRGs are much closer to those of
local LIRGs than ULIRGs. This is consistent with our earlier finding that,
unlike local ULIRGs, our high-z starbursts are typically only in the early
stages of a merger. The SEDs of the composite sources are most similar to the
local archetypal warm ULIRG, Mrk231. In summary, our results show that there is
strong evolution in the SEDs between local and z~2 IR-luminous galaxies, as
well as that there is a wide range of SEDs among high redshift IR-luminous
sources. The publicly-available SED templates we derive from our sample will be
particularly useful for infrared population synthesis models, as well as in the
interpretation of other mid-IR high-z galaxies in particular those detected by
the recent all sky WISE survey.

gregarious insects are attracted to conspecifics and can form large
aggregations such as marching hopper bands. Numerous biological experiments at
the individual level have shown how crowding biases conversion towards the
gregarious form. To understand the formation of marching locust hopper bands,
we study phase change at the collective level, and in a quantitative framework.
Specifically, we construct a partial integrodifferential equation model
incorporating the interplay between phase change and spatial movement at the
individual level in order to predict the dynamics of hopper band formation at
the population level. Stability analysis of our model reveals conditions for an
outbreak, characterized by a large scale transition to the gregarious phase. A
model reduction enables quantification of the temporal dynamics of each phase,
of the proportion of the population that will eventually gregarize, and of the
time scale for this to occur. Numerical simulations provide descriptions of the
aggregation's structure and reveal transiently traveling clumps of gregarious
insects. Our predictions of aggregation and mass gregarization suggest several
possible future biological experiments.

used to show that a stationary, stochastically continuous, sum- or max-i.d.
random process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be generated by a measure-preserving flow
on a $\sigma$-finite Borel measure space and that this flow is unique. This
development makes it possible to extend the classification program of
Rosi\'{n}ski (Ann. Probab. 23 (1995) 1163-1187) with a unified treatment of
both sum- and max-infinitely divisible processes. As a particular case, a
characterization of stationary, stochastically continuous, union-infinitely
divisible random measurable subsets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is obtained. Introduced
and classified are several new max-i.d. random field models including fields of
Penrose type and fields associated to Poisson line processes.

symmetry, the dynamical equations automatically lead to the Legendre and the
associated Legendre equations, with the respective orthogonal polynomials as
their standard solutions. This is a very general and important result and
appears in many problems in physics (for example, the multipole expansion etc).
We study these equations from an operator point of view, much like the harmonic
oscillator, and show that there is an underlying shape invariance symmetry in
these systems responsible for their solubility. We bring out various
interesting features resulting from this analysis from the shape invariance
point of view.

stack of $N$ identical one-dimensional lattices (tubes) polarized
perpendicularly to the lattices. In this arrangement the intra-lattice
interaction is purely repulsive preventing the system collapse and the
inter-lattice one is attractive. The dipoles may represent polar molecules or
indirect excitons. The transition separates two phases; in one of them
superfluidity (understood as algebraic decay of the corresponding correlation
functions) takes place in each individual lattice, in the other (chain
superfluid) the order parameter is the product of bosonic operators from all
lattices. We argue that in the presence of finite inter-lattice tunneling the
transition belongs to the universality class of the $q=N$ two-dimensional
classical Potts model. For $N=2,3,4$ the corresponding low energy field theory
is the model of Z$_N$ parafermions perturbed by the thermal operator. Results
of Monte Carlo simulations are consistent with these predictions. The detection
scheme for the chain superfluid of indirect excitons is outlined.

up. Interestingly enough, this method converts the task of probing the
unitarity of a given 3D system, that is in general a time-consuming work, into
a straightforward algebraic exercise; besides, it also greatly clarifies the
physical interpretation of the propagating modes. In order to test the efficacy
and quickness of the algorithm at hand, the unitarity of some important and

fields within a nonuniform dispersive and absorptive system. This system is
formed by vacuum and lossy medium separated by a plane interface. As a medium,
we used dielectric and metal samples characterized by local and nonlocal
optical properties. Thermodynamic properties of surface eigenmodes of plane
interfaces are discussed. Various definitions of density of states and spectral
characteristics of surface polaritons in equilibrium at the interface formed by
vacuum and lossy medium are described and discussed. All formulas for
thermodynamic functions are represented in terms of density of states. The
generalized density of states is calculated based on the Barash-Ginzburg theory
and dispersion relations for the surface states in different approaches. It is
exemplified that different definitions of the density of states are identical
in the case of dissipationless materials. The spectral functions and integrated
over all frequencies thermodynamic characteristics and their temperature
dependences are demonstrated.

expectation value (VEV) of the fermionic current in the space with an arbitrary
number of toroidally compactified dimensions. As a geometry of boundaries we
consider two parallel plates on which the fermion field obeys bag boundary
conditions. Along the compact dimensions, periodicity conditions are imposed
with arbitrary phases. In addition, the presence of a constant gauge field is
assumed. The nontrivial topology gives rise to an Aharonov-Bohm effect for the
fermionic current induced by the gauge field. It is shown that the VEV of the
charge density vanishes and the current density has nonzero expectation values
for the components along compact dimensions only. The latter are periodic odd
functions of the magnetic flux with the period equal to the flux quantum. In
the region between the plates, the VEV of the fermionic current is decomposed
into pure topological, single plate and interference parts. For a massless
field the single plate part vanishes and the interference part is distributed
uniformly. The corresponding results are generalized for conformally-flat
spacetimes. Applications of the general formulas to finite-length carbon
nanotubes are given within the framework of the Dirac model for quasiparticles
in graphene. In the absence of the magnetic flux, two sublattices of the
honeycomb graphene lattice yield opposite contributions and the fermionic
current vanishes. A magnetic flux through the cross section of the nanotube
breaks the symmetry allowing the current to flow along the compact dimension.
