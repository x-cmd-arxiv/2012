starting point is a local effective action that includes three- and
four-nucleon interactions, expressed in terms of nucleon and two-nucleon boson
fields. The evolution of the coupling constants in this action is described by
a renormalisation group flow. We derive these flow equations both in the limit
of exact Wigner SU(4) symmetry and in the realistic case of broken symmetry. In
the symmetric limit we find that the renormalisation flow equations decouple,
and can be combined into two sets, one of which matches the known results for
bosons, and the other result matches the one for fermions with spin degrees
only. The equations show universal features in the unitary limit, which is
obtained when the two-body scattering length tends to infinity. We calculate
the spin-quartet neutron-deuteron scattering length and the deuteron-deuteron
scattering lengths in the spin-singlet and quintet channels.

cellular communication deployed today. A variety of services of 2G systems has
increased significantly and this will continue to grow even further in the
emerging third-generation (3G) systems. Universal Mobile Telecommunication
System (UMTS) is a third-generation mobile communications system which uses the
Wide-Band Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) technique to support a wide
variety of services, like speech, video telephony, Internet browsing, etc.
These services require a wide range of Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.
QoS is an important issue as the number of multimedia services increases day by
day. Differentiated QoS methods allow the differentiation of users based on
their priority levels and channel conditions so that the network can allocate
the bandwidth for a particular request based on the QoS requirements. These
requirements are controlled by Radio Resource Management (RRM) mechanisms. In
this paper we have proposed two RRM algorithms which are modification to the
existing scheduling algorithms. One is Prioritized C/I scheduling, which takes
the priorities into consideration, and this algorithm serves the user with
highest priority. Other algorithm is Modified Inverse C/I scheduling, which
takes channel conditions into consideration and serves the users in degraded
conditions, thereby improving QoS. The performance evaluation of two algorithms
is done with EURANE extensions for NS-2. Simulation results shows the
improvement in QoS for the users who are at equidistance from Base Station (BS)
but requesting for different services by implementing Prioritized C/I
scheduling and also for the users who are in degraded conditions by
implementing Modified Inverse C/I scheduling when compared to Max C/I and
Inverse C/I scheduling algorithm respectively.

In medium and heavy systems, $\bar\eta$ decreases with increasing $T$ at

lighter systems (with the mass number $A\leq$ 20), $\bar\eta$ increases with
$T$ at a value of $M$ close to the maximal value $M_{max}$, which is defined as
the limiting angular momentum for each system. The values of $\bar\eta$

Particles with negative strangeness are assumed to remain in chemical

event is explicitly preserved. This implies that Xi baryons can be released

exemplifies an intricate phenomenon whereby heavy-tailed traffic at one queue

Outward migration can occur when a star in a low eccentricity orbit lags a
short-lived local spiral arm density peak. We interpret short lived local
density peaks, that appear and fade on approximately an orbital period, as
arising from positive interference between spiral density wave patterns. Stars
near such a peak can migrate over a significant distance in galactocentric
radius during the peak lifetime, providing that the peak is sufficiently dense.
Using a Gaussian bar model for the potential perturbation associated with a
narrow transient spiral feature, estimates of the migration rate, angular
offset between particle and spiral feature, and maximum eccentricity for
migrators roughly agrees with the values measured in our simulation. When
multiple spiral density waves are present, local density peaks can appear and
disappear on timescales faster than the timescale estimated for growth and
decay of individual waves and the peak surface density can be larger than for
any individual wave. Consequently, migration induced by transient density peaks
may be more pervasive than that mediated by the growth and decay of individual
patterns and occurring at their corotation resonance. We discuss interpretation
of transient-like behavior in terms of interfering patterns, including
estimating a coherence time for features that appear due to constructive
interference, their effective angular rotation rates and the speed and
direction that a density maximum would move across a galaxy inducing a
localized and traveling burst of star formation.

low density wind during a rapid decline in luminosity. We identify a slow dense
wind expanding at only 500--600 km/s, present throughout the eruption. A faster
wind speed V ~ 900 km/s may be identified with a second phase of the outburst.
There is no direct or significant evidence for any flow speed above 1000 km/s;
the broad asymmetric wings of Balmer emission lines in the hot wind phase were
due to Thomson scattering, not bulk motion. We estimate a mass loss rate of
order 0.04 Msun/yr during the hot dense wind phase of the event. There is no
evidence that the kinetic energy substantially exceeded the luminous energy,
roughly 2 X 10^49 ergs; so the total energy was far less than a true SN. We

$\chi_{b1}(1,2P)$. The contradiction gets even stronger, if the transition
$h_b(2P) \to \Upsilon(1S) \, \eta$ has branching fraction of a few percent or

of the Lindblad-Kossakowski type. This generator satisfies some suitable decay
condition in space. We show that the dynamics with a such generator on a finite

Lieb-Robinson bounds for a finite lattice systems we also show the existence of

Lieb-Robinson bounds also holds.

of two-level atoms that pass one by one through the microwave cavity. The atoms
are randomly excited and there is exactly one atom present in the cavity at any

asymptotic behavior of the state of the cavity. We show that the number of
photons increases indefinitely in the case of the ideal cavity. In case of
leaky cavity we prove that the mean photon number in the cavity stabilizes in
time. The limiting state of the cavity in this case exists and it is
independent of the initial state. We calculate the characteristic functional of
this non-quasi-free non-equilibrium state. We also calculate the energy flux in

supernovae (SN) ejecta interaction with the CSM starting 59 days after the
explosion of the Type Ia SN (SN Ia) PTF 11kx, are best described by a violent
prompt merger. In this prompt merger scenario the common envelope (CE) phase is
terminated by a merger of a WD companion with the hot core of a massive
asymptotic giant (AGB) star. In most cases the WD is disrupted and accreted
onto the more massive core. However, in the rare cases where the merger takes
place when the WD is denser than the core, the core will be disrupted and
accreted onto the cooler WD. In such cases the explosion might occur with no
appreciable delay, i.e., months to years after the termination of the CE phase.
This, we propose, might be the evolutionary route that could lead to the
explosion of PTF 11kx. This scenario can account for the very massive CSM
within ~1000 AU of the exploding PTF 11kx star, for the presence of hydrogen,
and for the presence of shells in the CSM.

information networks like social networks or citation networks, with the goal
to enable temporal and evolutionary queries and analysis. We present the design
and architecture of a distributed graph database system that stores the entire
history of a network and provides support for efficient retrieval of multiple
graphs from arbitrary time points in the past, in addition to maintaining the
current state for ongoing updates. Our system exposes a general programmatic
API to process and analyze the retrieved snapshots. We introduce DeltaGraph, a
novel, extensible, highly tunable, and distributed hierarchical index structure
that enables compactly recording the historical information, and that supports
efficient retrieval of historical graph snapshots for single-site or parallel
processing. Along with the original graph data, DeltaGraph can also maintain
and index auxiliary information; this functionality can be used to extend the
structure to efficiently execute queries like subgraph pattern matching over
historical data. We develop analytical models for both the storage space needed
and the snapshot retrieval times to aid in choosing the right parameters for a
specific scenario. In addition, we present strategies for materializing
portions of the historical graph state in memory to further speed up the
retrieval process. Secondly, we present an in-memory graph data structure
called GraphPool that can maintain hundreds of historical graph instances in
main memory in a non-redundant manner. We present a comprehensive experimental
evaluation that illustrates the effectiveness of our proposed techniques at
managing historical graph information.

rampant violence is threatening social order. Here we show that the
socio-economic origins of violence recently changed. Prior to 2008, violence
can be attributed to inter-group conflict between ethnically and religiously
distinct groups. Starting in 2008, increasing global food prices triggered a
new wave of violence that spread to the endemically poor southern region with
demands for government change and economic concessions. This violence shares
its origins with many other food riots and the more recent Arab Spring. The
loss of social order and the opportunities for terror organizations can be best
addressed by directly eliminating the causes of violence. Inter-group violence
can be addressed by delineating within-country provinces for local autonomy of
ethnic and religious groups. The impact of food prices can be alleviated by
direct food price interventions, or by addressing the root causes of global
food price increases in US policies that have promoted conversion of corn to
ethanol and commodity speculation. Addressing the food prices is the most
urgent concern as a new bubble in food prices has been projected to begin
before the end of 2012.

energy signature, with cascade decays concluding in a neutralino that escapes
the detector. In theories where R-parity is broken the missing energy is
replaced with additional jets or leptons, often making traditional search
strategies ineffective. Such R-parity violation is very constrained, however,
by resulting B and L violating signals, requiring couplings so small that LSPs
will decay outside the detector in all but a few scenarios. In theories with
additional matter fields, R-parity can be broken collectively, such that
R-parity is not broken by any single coupling, but only by an ensemble of
couplings. Cascade decays can proceed normally, with each step only sensitive
to one or two couplings at a time, but B and L violation requires the full set,
yielding a highly suppressed constraint. s-channel production of new scalar
states, typically small for standard RPV, can be large when RPV is broken
collectively. While missing energy is absent, making these models difficult to
discover by traditional SUSY searches, they produce complicated many object
resonances (MORes), with many different possible numbers of jets and leptons.
We outline a simple model and discuss its discoverability at the LHC.

Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) traced by these variable stars. We estimate the
distance to 16949 RR Lyrae stars by using their photometrically estimated
metallicities. Furthermore the periods of 1849 Cepheids are used to determine
their distances. Three-dimensional maps are obtained by using individual
reddening estimates derived from the intrinsic color of these stars. The
resulting median distances of the RR Lyrae stars and Cepheids appear to resolve
the long and short distance scale problem for our sample. With median distances
of 53.1 \pm 3.2 kpc for the RR Lyrae stars and 53.9 \pm 1.8 kpc for the
Cepheids, these two distance indicators are in very good agreement with each
other in contrast to a number of earlier studies. Individual reddening
estimates allow us to resolve the distance discrepancies often observed while
comparing Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars. For both stellar populations we find the
inclination angle of the LMC to be 32{\deg} \pm 4{\deg} and the mean position
angle to be 115{\deg} \pm 15{\deg}. The position angle increases with
galactocentric radius, indicative of mild twisting. Within the innermost 7
degrees of the LMC covered by OGLE III the change in position angle amounts to
more than 10 degrees. The depth of the Cepheids is found to be 1.7 \pm 0.2 kpc.
The bar stands out as an overdensity both in RR Lyrae stars and in Cepheids. In
RR Lyrae stars the bar can be traced as a protruding overdensity with a
line-of-sight depth of almost 5 kpc in front of the main body of the disk.

four of the five globular clusters (GCs) in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy

distribution which shows a broad peak around [Fe/H]=-1 with only a few percent
of the stars having [Fe/H]<-2. If we only consider stars and clusters with

estimate that about 1/5-1/4 of all stars in the Fornax dSph with [Fe/H]<-2
belong to the four most metal-poor GCs. These GCs could, therefore, at most
have been a factor of 4-5 more massive initially. Yet, the Fornax GCs appear to
share the same anomalous chemical abundance patterns known from Milky Way GCs,
commonly attributed to the presence of multiple stellar generations within the
clusters. The extreme ratio of metal-poor GC- versus field stars in the Fornax
dSph is difficult to reconcile with scenarios for self-enrichment and early
evolution of GCs in which a large fraction (90%-95%) of the first-generation
stars have been lost. It also suggests that the GCs may not have formed as part
of a larger population of now disrupted clusters with an initial power-law mass
distribution. The Fornax dSph may be a rosetta stone for constraining theories
of the formation, self-enrichment and early dynamical evolution of star
clusters.

and 384 field quiescent early-type galaxies from the COSMOS survey, selected
from z~1 to the present, and with masses $log(M/M_\odot)>10.5$.
  The galaxy size growth depends on galaxy mass and early-type galaxy
morphology, e.g., elliptical galaxies evolve differently than lenticular
galaxies. At the low mass end -$10.5<Log(M/M_\odot)<11$, ellipticals do not
show strong size growth from $z\sim1$ to the present (10% to 30% depending on
the morphological classification). On the other end, massive ellipticals
-log(M/M_\odot)>11.2$- approximately doubled their size. Interestingly,
lenticular galaxies display different behavior: they appear more compact on
average and they do show a size growth of \sim60% since z=1 independent of
stellar mass. We compare our results with state-of-the art semi-analytic
models.
  While major and minor mergers can account for most of the galaxy size growth,
we find that with present data and the theoretical uncertainties in the
modeling we cannot state clear evidence favoring either merger or mass loss via
quasar and/or stellar winds as the primary mechanism driving the evolution.
  The galaxy mass--size relation and the size growth do not depend on
environment in the halo mass range explored in this work (field to group mass
$log(M_h/M_\odot)<14$), i.e., group and field galaxies follow the same trends,
which is at variance with predictions from current hierarchical models that
show a clear dependence of size growth on halo mass for massive ellipticals

systems, bringing the total number studied within the Homogeneous Studies
project to 82. Transit light curves are modelled using JKTEBOP, with careful
attention paid to limb darkening, eccentricity and third light. The physical
properties of each system are obtained from the photometric parameters,
published spectroscopic measurements and five sets of theoretical stellar model
predictions. Statistical errors are assessed using Monte Carlo and
residual-permutation algorithms and propagated via a perturbation algorithm.
Systematic errors are estimated from the interagreement between results
calculated using five theoretical stellar models. The headline result is a
major upward revision of the radius of the planet in the OGLE-TR-56 system,
from 1.23-1.38 Rjup to 1.734 +/- 0.051 +/- 0.029 Rjup (statistical and
systematic errors, respectively). Its density is three times lower than
previously thought. This change comes from the first complete analysis of
published high-quality photometry. Significantly larger planetary radii are
also found for Kepler-15, KOI-428, WASP-13, WASP-14 and WASP-21 compared to
previous work. I present the first results based on Kepler short-cadence data
for Kepler-14, Kepler-15 and KOI-135. More extensive long-cadence data s used
to improve the measured properties of KOI-196, KOI-204, KOI-254, KOI-423 and
KOI-428. Detailed analyses are given for HAT-P-3, HAT-P-6, HAT-P-9, HAT-P-14
and WASP-12, based on more extensive datasets than considered in previous
studies. I revisit the correlations between orbital period and surface gravity,
and orbital period and mass of the transiting planets, finding both to be
significant at the 4 sigma level. I conclude by discussing the opportunities
for follow-up observations, the sky positions and the discovery rate of the
known transiting planets.

system, obtained using telescope defocussing techniques and with scatters
reaching 0.5 mmag per point. Our revised orbital period is 4.0 +/- 0.6 s longer
than previous measurements, a difference of 6.6 sigma, and does not support the
published detections of orbital eccentricity in this system. We model the light
curves using the JKTEBOP code and calculate the physical properties of the
system by recourse to five sets of theoretical stellar model predictions. The
resulting planetary radius, Rb = 1.932 +/- 0.052 +/- 0.010 Rjup (statistical
and systematic errors respectively), provides confirmation that WASP-17b is the
largest planet currently known. All fourteen planets with radii measured to be
greater than 1.6 Rjup are found around comparatively hot (Teff > 5900 K) and
massive (MA > 1.15 Msun) stars. Chromospheric activity indicators are available
for eight of these stars, and all imply a low activity level. The planets have
small or zero orbital eccentricities, so tidal effects struggle to explain
their large radii. The observed dearth of large planets around small stars may
be natural but could also be due to observational biases against deep transits,
if these are mistakenly labelled as false positives and so not followed up.

z'-band dropout color selection criteria, using the NIR data generated here. We
have identified two possible Lyman Break Galaxy (LBG) candidates at z\gtrsim6.5
with J\lesssim24.5. The first candidate is a likely LBG at z\sim6.5 based on a
weak spectral feature tentatively identified as Lyalpha line in the deep
Keck/DEIMOS spectrum, while the second candidate is a possible LBG at z\sim7
based on its photometric redshift. These z'-dropout objects, if confirmed, are
among the brightest such candidates found so far. At z\gtrsim6.5, their star
formation rate is estimated as 100-200 solar mass per year. If they continue to
form stars at this rate, they assemble a stellar mass of ~5x10^10 solar mass
after about 400 million years, becoming the progenitors of massive galaxies
observed at z\sim5. We study the implication of the z'-band dropout candidates
discovered here, in constraining the bright-end of the luminosity function and
understanding the nature of high redshift galaxies.

galactic nucleus (AGN) powered outflow in NGC 1266. This unusual galaxy is
relatively nearby (D=30 Mpc), allowing us to investigate the process of AGN
feedback in action. We present maps of the kinematics and line strengths of the
ionised gas emission lines Halpha, Hbeta, [OIII], [OI], [NII] and [SII], and
report on the detection of Sodium D absorption. We use these tracers to explore
the structure of the source, derive the ionised and atomic gas kinematics and
investigate the gas excitation and physical conditions. NGC 1266 contains two
ionised gas components along most lines of sight, tracing the ongoing outflow
and a component closer to the galaxy systemic, the origin of which is unclear.
This gas appears to be disturbed by a nascent AGN jet. We confirm that the
outflow in NGC 1266 is truly multiphase, containing radio plasma, atomic,
molecular and ionised gas and X-ray emitting plasma. The outflow has velocities
up to \pm900 km/s away from the systemic velocity, and is very likely to be
removing significant amounts of cold gas from the galaxy. The LINER-like
line-emission in NGC 1266 is extended, and likely arises from fast shocks
caused by the interaction of the radio jet with the ISM. These shocks have
velocities of up to 800 km/s, which match well with the observed velocity of
the outflow. Sodium D equivalent width profiles are used to set constraints on
the size and orientation of the outflow. The ionised gas morphology correlates
with the nascent radio jets observed in 1.4 GHz and 5 GHz continuum emission,
supporting the suggestion that an AGN jet is providing the energy required to
drive the outflow.

flow) of matter carries significant information on dark energy, dark matter and
the underlying theory of gravity on large scales. Peculiar motions of galaxies
introduce systematic deviations between the observed galaxy redshifts z and the
corresponding cosmological redshifts z_cos. A novel method for estimating the
angular power spectrum of the peculiar velocity field based on observations of
galaxy redshifts and apparent magnitudes m (or equivalently fluxes) is
presented. This method exploits the fact that a mean relation between z_cos and
m of galaxies can be derived from all galaxies in a redshift-magnitude survey.
Given a galaxy magnitude, it is shown that the z_cos(m) relation yields its
cosmological redshift with a 1-sigma error of sigma_z~0.3 for a survey like
Euclid (~10^9 galaxies at z<~2), and can be used to constrain the angular power
spectrum of z-z_cos(m) with a high signal-to-noise ratio. At large angular
separations corresponding to l<~15, we obtain significant constraints on the
power spectrum of the peculiar velocity field. At 15<~l<~60, magnitude shifts
in the z_cos(m) relation caused by gravitational lensing magnification
dominate, allowing us to probe the line-of-sight integral of the gravitational
potential. Effects related to the environmental dependence in the luminosity
function can easily be computed and their contamination removed from the
estimated power spectra. The amplitude of the combined velocity and lensing
power spectra at z~1 can be measured with <~5% accuracy.

is presumably a consequence of their formation from a single spinning gaseous
disk. For exoplanetary systems this well-aligned configuration is not
guaranteed: dynamical interactions may tilt planetary orbits, or stars may be
misaligned with the protoplanetary disk through chaotic accretion, magnetic
interactions or torques from neighbouring stars. Indeed, isolated 'hot
Jupiters' are often misaligned and even orbiting retrograde. Here we report an
analysis of transits of planets over starspots on the Sun-like star Kepler-30,
and show that the orbits of its three planets are aligned with the stellar
equator. Furthermore, the orbits are aligned with one another to within a few
degrees. This configuration is similar to that of our Solar System, and
contrasts with the isolated hot Jupiters. The orderly alignment seen in the
Kepler-30 system suggests that high obliquities are confined to systems that
experienced disruptive dynamical interactions. Should this be corroborated by
observations of other coplanar multi-planet systems, then star-disk
misalignments would be ruled out as the explanation for the high obliquities of
hot Jupiters, and dynamical interactions would be implicated as the origin of
hot Jupiters.

with decreasing luminosity, a common behaviour of black holes at low

its spectrum (the collection of all eigenvalues of the network's weighted

a network, considered as a graph, to a smaller network with fewer vertices and
edges while preserving the spectrum (or spectral information) of the original
network. This procedure allows for the introduction of new equivalence
relations between networks, where two networks are spectrally equivalent if
they can be reduced to the same network. Additionally, using this theory it is
possible to establish whether a network, modeled as a dynamical system, has a
globally attracting fixed point (is strongly synchronizing). In this paper we
further develop this theory of isospectral network transformations and
demonstrate that our procedures are applicable to families of parameterized

return and SNIa enrichment, and consider recently published SNIa yields. By
adjusting a single model parameter to obtain a match to the global abundance
pattern in NGC 4649 we infer that introduction of subsolar metallicity external
gas has reduced the overall ISM metallicity and diluted the effectiveness of
SNIa to skew the pattern towards low alpha-to-Fe ratios, and estimate the
combination of SNIa rate and level of dilution. Evidently, newly-introduced gas
is heated as it is integrated into, and interacts with, the hot gas that is
already present. These results indicate a complex flow and enrichment history
for NGC 4649, reflecting the continual evolution of elliptical galaxies beyond
the formation epoch. The heating and circulation of accreted gas may help
reconcile this dynamic history with the mostly passive evolution of elliptical
stellar populations. In an appendix we examine the effects of the recent

working with a single heat reservoir like atmosphere. The engine first gets an
energy intake, which can be done in arbitrary non-equilibrium way e.g.
combustion of fuel. Then the engine performs the work and returns to the
initial state. We distinguish two general classes of engines where the working
body first equilibrates within itself and then performs the work (ergodic
engine) or when it performs the work before equilibrating (non-ergodic engine).
We show that in both cases the second law of thermodynamics limits their
efficiency. For ergodic engines we find a rigorous upper bound for the
efficiency, which is strictly smaller than the equivalent Carnot efficiency.
I.e. the Carnot efficiency can be never achieved in single reservoir heat
engines. For non-ergodic engines the efficiency can be higher and can exceed
the equilibrium Carnot bound. By extending the fundamental thermodynamic
relation to nonequilibrium processes, we find a rigorous thermodynamic bound
for the efficiency of both ergodic and non-ergodic engines and show that it is
given by the relative entropy of the non-equilibrium and initial equilibrium
distributions.These results suggest a new general strategy for designing more
efficient engines. We illustrate our ideas by using simple examples.

collected by the BABAR detector at SLAC, we measure T-violating parameters in
the time evolution of neutral B mesons, yielding $\Delta S_T^+ = -1.37 \pm 0.14

a 1/9th site depleted and 1/7th bond depleted triangular lattice. Our classical
Monte Carlo simulations, verified by exact results for small system sizes, show
that the AFI model on this corner-shared triangle net (with coupling constant
$J_1$) is highly frustrated, with a residual entropy of $\frac{S}{N}$=
0.48185$\pm$0.00008. Anticipating that it may be difficult to achieve perfect

deleted bonds ($J_2$) to create a lattice of edge-sharing triangles. Below a
critical temperature which grows linearly with $J_2$ for small $J_2$, we
identify the nature of the unusual magnetic ordering and present analytic
expressions for the low temperature residual entropy. We compute the static
structure factor and find evidence for long range partial order for
antiferromagnetic $J_2$, and short range magnetic order otherwise. The magnetic
susceptibility crosses over from following a Curie-Weiss law at high
temperatures to a low temperature Curie law whose slope clearly distinguishes
ferromagnetic $J_2$ from the $J_2 = 0$ case. We briefly comment on a recent

of generic non-linear dynamical systems in four-dimensional spacetimes. It is
assumed that the time level surfaces are foliated by a one-parameter family of
codimension two compact surfaces with no boundary and which are conformal to a
Riemannian manifold C. The method is based on the use of a multipole expansion
determined uniquely by the induced metric structure on C. The approach is fully
spectral in the angular directions. The dynamics in the complementary 1+1
Lorentzian spacetime is followed by making use of a fourth order finite
differencing scheme with adaptive mesh refinement.
  In checking the reliability of the introduced new method the evolution of a
massless scalar field on a fixed Kerr spacetime is investigated. In particular,
the angular distribution of the evolving field in to be superradiant scattering
is studied. The primary aim was to check the validity of some of the recent
arguments claiming that the Penrose process, or its field theoretical
correspondence---superradiance---does play crucial role in jet formation in
black hole spacetimes while matter accretes onto the central object. Our
findings appear to be on contrary to these claims as the angular dependence of
a to be superradiant scattering of a massless scalar field does not show any
preference of the axis of rotation. In addition, the process of superradiance,
in case of a massless scalar field, was also investigated. On contrary to the
general expectations no energy extraction from black hole was found even though
the incident wave packets was fine tuned to be maximally superradiant. Instead
of energy extraction the to be superradiant part of the incident wave packet
fails to reach the ergoregion rather it suffers a total reflection which
appears to be a new phenomenon.

algorithms. Two ways to model delays on a network are presented. The first
model assumes that each link delivers messages with a fixed (constant) amount
of delay, and the second model is more realistic, allowing for i.i.d.
time-varying bounded delays. In contrast to previous work studying the effects
of delays on consensus algorithms, the models studied here allow for a node to
receive multiple messages from the same neighbor in one iteration. The analysis
of the fixed delay model shows that convergence to a consensus is guaranteed
and the rate of convergence is reduced by no more than a factor O(B^2) where B
is the maximum delay on any link. For the time-varying delay model we also give
a convergence proof which, for row-stochastic consensus protocols, is not a
trivial consequence of ergodic matrix products. In both delay models, the
consensus value is no longer the average, even if the original protocol was an
averaging protocol. For this reason, we propose the use of a different
consensus algorithm called Push-Sum [Kempe et al. 2003]. We model delays in the
Push-Sum framework and show that convergence to the average consensus is
guaranteed. This suggests that Push-Sum might be a better choice from a
practical standpoint.

disappeared. Thus, our imaging survey has a higher sensitivity to the host
galaxies of the intervening absorbers than the normal imaging surveys in the
direction of QSOs, for which the QSO glare tends to hide the foreground
galaxies. In this deep imaging survey, we could not detect any unambiguous
candidates for the host galaxies of the intervening absorbers. Using the 3sigma
upper limit of the flux in the optical to mid-infrared observing bands, which
corresponds to the UV to optical bands in the rest-frame of the intervening

hosts. We estimated the star-formation rates for the intervening absorbers as <
2.5 Msun/yr for z>3 DLAs and < 1.0 Msun/yr for z~2 MgII systems. Their stellar
masses are estimated to be several times 10^9 Msun or smaller for all
intervening galaxies. These properties are comparable to dwarf galaxies, rather
than the massive star-forming galaxies commonly seen in the z>2 galaxy surveys

  http://jdh.hamkins.org/a-forcing-class-and-its-modal-logic",,,,"math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The modal logic of forcing arises when one considers a model of set theory in
the context of all its forcing extensions, interpreting necessity as ""in all
forcing extensions"" and possibility as ""in some forcing extension"". In this
modal language one may easily express sweeping general forcing principles, such
as the assertion that every possibly necessary statement is necessarily
possible, which is valid for forcing, or the assertion that every possibly
necessary statement is true, which is the maximality principle, a forcing axiom
independent of but equiconsistent with ZFC (Stavi-V\""a\""an\""anen, Hamkins).
Every definable forcing class similarly gives rise to the corresponding forcing
modalities, for which one considers extensions only by forcing notions in that
class. In previous work, we proved that if ZFC is consistent, then the
ZFC-provably valid principles of the class of all forcing are precisely the
assertions of the modal theory S4.2. In this article, we prove that the
provably valid principles of collapse forcing, Cohen forcing and other classes
are in each case exactly S4.3; the provably valid principles of c.c.c. forcing,
proper forcing, and others are each contained within S4.3 and do not contain
S4.2; the provably valid principles of countably closed forcing, CH-preserving
forcing and others are each exactly S4.2; and the provably valid principles of
$\omega_1$-preserving forcing are contained within S4.tBA. All these results
arise from general structural connections we have identified between a forcing
class and the modal logic of forcing to which it gives rise, including the
connection between various control statements, such as buttons, switches and
ratchets, and their corresponding forcing validities. These structural
connections therefore support a forcing-only analysis of other diverse forcing
classes.

sophisticated infrastructure that leverages compromised users accounts, known
as bots, to automate the creation of new social networking accounts for
spamming and malware propagation. Traditional defense mechanisms are often
passive and reactive to non-zero-day attacks. In this paper, we adopt a
proactive approach for enhancing security in social networks by infiltrating
botnets with honeybots. We propose an integrated system named SODEXO which can
be interfaced with social networking sites for creating deceptive honeybots and
leveraging them for gaining information from botnets. We establish a
Stackelberg game framework to capture strategic interactions between honeybots
and botnets, and use quantitative methods to understand the tradeoffs of
honeybots for their deployment and exploitation in social networks. We design a
protection and alert system that integrates both microscopic and macroscopic
models of honeybots and optimally determines the security strategies for
honeybots. We corroborate the proposed mechanism with extensive simulations and
comparisons with passive defenses.

quantum information processing beyond the possibilities of spins or bosons
which have been studied more extensively. One particularly interesting model to
study, in view of recent progress in manipulating ultracold fermion gases, is
the fermionic version of measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC), which
implements full quantum computation with only single site measurements on a
proper fermionic many-body resource state. However, it is not known which
fermionic states can be used as the resource states for MBQC and how to find
them. In this paper, we generalize the framework of spin MBQC to fermions. In
particular, we provide a general formalism to construct many-body entangled
fermion resource states for MBQC based on the fermionic projected entangled
pair state representation. We give a specific fermionic state which enables
universal MBQC and demonstrate that the non-locality inherent in fermion
systems can be properly taken care of with suitable measurement schemes. Such a
framework opens up possibilities of finding MBQC resource states which can be
more readily realized in the lab.

acquisition, real-time analysis of a precursor scan results in selection of a
handful of peaks for subsequent isolation, fragmentation and secondary
scanning. This peak selection protocol typically focuses on the most abundant
peaks in the precursor scan, while attempting to avoid re-sampling the same m/z
values in rapid succession. The protocol does not, however, incorporate
analysis of previous fragmentation scans into the peak selection procedure.
  Methods: In this work, we investigate the feasibility and utility of
incorporating analysis of previous fragmentation scans into the peak selection
protocol. We demonstrate that real-time identification of fragmentation spectra
is feasible in principle, and we investigate, via simulations, several
strategies to make use of the resulting peptide identifications during peak
selection.
  Results: Our simulations fail to provide evidence that peptide
identifications can provide a large improvement in the total number of peptides
identified by a shotgun proteomics experiment.
  Conclusions: These results are significant because they point out the
feasibility of using peptide identifications during peak selection, and because
our experiments may provide a starting point for others working in this
direction.

closure's subgrid spectral transfers and flux. We apply this method to 6
different closures for forced-dissipative simulations of the barotropic
vorticity equation on a f-plane (2D Navier-Stokes equation). Using a
high-resolution benchmark, we compare each closure's model of energy and
enstrophy transfer to the actual transfer observed in the benchmark run. The
error-landscape norms enable us to both make objective comparisons between the
closures and to optimize each closure's free parameter for a fair comparison.
The hyper-viscous closure most closely reproduces the enstrophy cascade,
especially at larger scales due to the concentration of its dissipative effects
to the very smallest scales. The viscous and Leith closures perform nearly as
well, especially at smaller scales where all three models were dissipative. The
Smagorinsky closure dissipates enstrophy at the wrong scales. The anticipated
potential vorticity closure was the only model to reproduce the upscale
transfer of kinetic energy from the unresolved scales, but would require
high-order Laplacian corrections in order to concentrate dissipation at the
smallest scales. The Lagrangian-averaged alpha-model closure did not perform
successfully for forced 2D isotropic Navier-Stokes: small-scale filamentation
is only slightly reduced by the model while small-scale roll-up is prevented.
Together, this reduces the effects of diffusion.

particularly since users experience varying spectrum availability over time and
location. In this paper, we propose a game theoretical approach that allows
cognitive radio pairs, namely the primary user (PU) and the secondary user
(SU), to update their transmission powers and frequencies simultaneously.
Specifically, we address a Stackelberg game model in which individual users
attempt to hierarchically access to the wireless spectrum while maximizing
their energy efficiency. A thorough analysis of the existence, uniqueness and
characterization of the Stackelberg equilibrium is conducted. In particular, we
show that a spectrum coordination naturally occurs when both actors in the
system decide sequentially about their powers and their transmitting carriers.
As a result, spectrum sensing in such a situation turns out to be a simple
detection of the presence/absence of a transmission on each sub-band. We also
show that when users experience very different channel gains on their two
carriers, they may choose to transmit on the same carrier at the Stackelberg
equilibrium as this contributes enough energy efficiency to outweigh the
interference degradation caused by the mutual transmission. Then, we provide an
algorithmic analysis on how the PU and the SU can reach such a spectrum
coordination using an appropriate learning process. We validate our results
through extensive simulations and compare the proposed algorithm to some
typical scenarios including the non-cooperative case and the
throughput-based-utility systems. Typically, it is shown that the proposed
Stackelberg decision approach optimizes the energy efficiency while still
maximizing the throughput at the equilibrium.

predict a more cuspy behavior. One mechanism to reconcile the simulations with
the observed data is the feedback from star formation, this might be successful
in isolated dwarf galaxies but its success in LSB galaxies remains unclear.
Additionally, including too much feedback in the simulations is a double-edged
sword, in order to obtain a cored DM distribution from an initially cuspy one,
the feedback recipes usually require to remove a large quantity of baryons from
the center of galaxies, however, some feedback recipes produce twice more
satellite galaxies of a given luminosity and with much smaller mass to light
ratios from those that are observed. Therefore, one DM profile that produces
cores naturally and that does not require large amounts of feedback would be
preferable. We find both requirements to be satisfied in the scalar field dark
matter model. Here, we consider that the dark matter is an auto-interacting
real scalar field in a thermal bath at temperature T with an initial $Z_2$
symmetric potential, as the universe expands, the temperature drops so that the
$Z_2$ symmetry is spontaneously broken and the field rolls down to a new
minimum. We give an exact analytic solution to the Newtonian limit of this

demonstrate that continuous driving of the sensor spin by a composite pulse

both driving power imperfections and decoherence. A suitable choice of RE
parameters compensates for different scenarios of noise strength and origin.
The method can be applied to nanoscale sensing in variable environments or to
realize noise spectroscopy. In a room-temperature implementation based on a

Evaluation of multipartite entanglement measures is extremely hard for most

construct the minimal linear decomposition into product states for a large
group of pure graph states, allowing us to evaluate the Schmidt measure.
Furthermore we show that computation of distance-like measures such as relative
entropy of entanglement and geometric measure becomes tractable for these
states by explicit construction of closest separable and closest product states
respectively. We show how these separable states can be described using
stabiliser formalism as well as PEPs-like construction. Finally we discuss the
way in which introducing noise to the system can optimally destroy

introduced, and a presentation of the category is given; specifically, we prove

all equations among the morphisms. Full tensor functors are constructed from
this category to the category of tensor representations of the orthogonal group
$O(V)$ or the symplectic group $Sp(V)$ over any field of characteristic zero.
The first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory for these
classical groups are generalised to the category theoretic setting. The major
outcome is that we obtain new presentations for the endomorphism algebras of
the module $V^{\otimes r}$. These are obtained by appending to the standard
presentation of the Brauer algebra of degree $r$ one additional relation. This
relation stipulates the vanishing of an element of the Brauer algebra which is
quasi-idempotent, and which we describe explicitly both in terms of diagrams
and algebraically. In the symplectic case, if $\dim V = 2n$, the element is
precisely the central idempotent in the Brauer subalgebra of degree $n + 1$,
which corresponds to its trivial representation. Since this is the Brauer
algebra of highest degree which is semisimple, our generator is an exact
analogue for the Brauer algebra of the Jones idempotent of the Temperley-Lieb
algebra. In the orthogonal case the additional relation is also a
quasi-idempotent in the integral Brauer algebra. Both integral and quantum

differ in the wider-field heliospheric imaging case where small-angle

polarization for background subtraction, and generate simple forward models of
several classes of heliospheric feature. We conclude that pB measurements of

the detection of $\gamma$--emission that is unusual for such weak and short
event. The analysis revealed the presence of a flare precursor detected about 5
minutes before the flare onset in 94 \AA \ images which spatially coincided
with the non-polarized microwave (MW) source at 17 GHz (\textit{the Nobeyama
Radio Heliograph}) that is the Neutral Line associated Source (NLS). A
comparison of the results obtained from MW data by \textit{the Nobeyama Radio
Polarimeters} and \textit{the multi-frequency Siberian radioheliograph} (the
new 10-antenna radio heliograph prototype at 4.6 and 6.4 GHz) and hard X-ray
(HXR) observations by \textit{the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope} reveal the
presence of accelerated electrons during the flare initial phase. The analysis
of MW and HXR spectra also confirms the presence of accelerated particles.
Moreover a good temporal correlation between several lightcurves in different
HXR energy bands and at MW frequencies indicates generation of both HXR and MW
emission by a common population of accelerated electrons. Detection of
accelerated particles during the initial phase of the flare and
soft-hard-harder (SHH) behavior of the spectra indicate several episodes of
particle acceleration and confirm the non-impulsive type of the flare

of the Ha broad flux fraction with the star formation surface density of the
galaxy, with an apparent threshold for strong outflows occurring at 1 Msun
yr^-1 kpc^-2. Above this threshold, we find that SFGs with logm_\ast>10 have
similar or perhaps greater wind mass loading factors (eta = Mdotout/SFR) and
faster outflow velocities than lower mass SFGs. This trend suggests that the
majority of outflowing gas at z \sim 2 may derive from high-mass SFGs, and that
the z \sim 2 mass-metallicity relation is driven more by dilution of enriched
gas in the galaxy gas reservoir than by the efficiency of outflows. The mass
loading factor is also correlated with the SFR and inclination, such that more
star-forming and face-on galaxies launch more powerful outflows. For galaxies
that have evidence for strong outflows, we find that the broad emission is
spatially extended to at least the half-light radius (\sim a few kpc). We
propose that the observed threshold for strong outflows and the observed mass
loading of these winds can be explained by a simple model wherein break-out of
winds is governed by pressure balance in the disk. Using the ratio of the [SII]
doublet in a broad and narrow component, we find that outflowing gas has a
density of \sim10-100 cm^-3, significantly less than that of the star forming
gas (600 cm^-3).

version of the FDM (introduced recently in (J. Multivariate Anal. 101 (2010)

convergence of a weighted version of the underlying empirical process. The
latter is not problematic since there exist several results on weighted
empirical processes in the literature; see, for example, (J. Econometrics 130

function. Both will be demonstrated by various examples. In particular, we will
show that our FDM approach covers mainly all the results known in literature

high-resolution techniques. The angular differential imaging (ADI) technique is
one of them, initially developed for point-like sources but now increasingly
applied to extended objects. This new field of application raises many
questions because the disk images reduced with ADI depend strongly on the
amplitude of field rotation and the ADI data reduction strategy. Both of them
directly affect the disk observable properties. Our aim is to characterize the
applicability and biases of some ADI data reduction strategies for different
disk morphologies. A particular emphasis is placed on parameters mostly used
for disks: their surface brightness, their width for a ring, and local features
such as gaps or asymmetries. We first present a general method for predicting
and quantifying those biases. In a second step we illustrate them for some
widely used ADI algorithms applied to typical debris disk morphologies:
inclined rings with various inner/outer slopes and width. Last, our aim is also
to propose improvements of classical ADI to limit the biases on extended
objects. Simulated disks seen under various observing conditions were used to
reduce ADI data and quantify the resulting biases. These conclusions
complements previous results from NaCo L' real-disk images of HR4796A. ADI
induces flux losses on disks. This makes this technique appropriate only for
low- to medium-inclination disks. A theoretical criterion is derived to predict
the amount of flux loss for a given disk morphology, and quantitative estimates
of the biases are given in some specific configurations. These biases alter the
disk observable properties, such as the slopes of their surface brightness or
their radial/azimuthal extent. Additionally, this work demonstrates that ADI
can very easily create artificial features without involving astrophysical
processes.

automorphisms of the graph account for the discrete part of the group. We

recover the characterization by Letac and Massam of models that are

techniques unprecedented in previous studies of this crisis. The 200
earthquakes located onshore during 2004 and 2005 have been classified by
cross-correlation, resulting in a small number of significant families. The
application of a relative location algorithm (hypoDD) revealed important
features about the spatial distribution of the earthquakes. The seismic
catalogue has been enhanced with more than 800 additional events, detected only
by the closest seismic station. These events were assigned to families by
correlation and as a consequence their hypocentral location and magnitude were
estimated by comparing them to the earthquakes of each family. The new

to the northwest and the other to the southwest of the Teide-Pico Viejo complex

low-temperature series for the free energy density, energy density, heat
capacity, entropy density, as well as the magnetization are given and their
range of validity is critically examined in view of the Mermin-Wagner theorem.
The calculation involves the renormalization and numerical evaluation of a
particular three-loop graph which is discussed in detail. Interestingly, in the
low-temperature series for the two-dimensional ideal ferromagnet, the spin-wave
interaction manifests itself in the form of logarithmic terms. In the free
energy density the leading such term is of order $T^4 \ln T$ -- remarkably, in
the case of the three-dimensional ideal ferromagnet no logarithmic terms arise
in the low-temperature series. While the present study demonstrates that it is
straightforward to consider effects up to three-loop order in the effective
field theory framework, this precision seems to be far beyond the reach of
microscopic methods such as modified spin-wave theory.

present a new Anisotropic Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm which we use
as transition in the MCMC method. We first prove that this new sampler leads to
a geometrically uniformly ergodic Markov chain. We prove also that under mild
conditions, the estimated parameters converge almost surely and are
asymptotically Gaussian distributed. The methodology developed is then tested
on handwritten digits and some 2D and 3D medical images for the deformable

Lac object S5 0716+714 (on December 9-16, 2009). In the radio bands the source
shows rapid (~ (0.5-1.5) day) intra-day variability with peak amplitudes of up
to ~ 10 %. The variability at 2.8 cm leads by about 1 day the variability at 6
cm and 11 cm. This time lag and more rapid variations suggests an intrinsic
contribution to the source's intraday variability at 2.8 cm, while at 6 cm and
11 cm interstellar scintillation (ISS) seems to predominate. Large and
quasi-sinusoidal variations of ~ 0.8 mag were detected in the V, R and I-bands.
The X-ray data (0.2-10 keV) do not reveal significant variability on a 4 day
time scale, favoring reprocessed inverse-Compton over synchrotron radiation in
this band. The characteristic variability time scales in radio and optical
bands are similar. A quasi-periodic variation (QPO) of 0.9 - 1.1 days in the
optical data may be present, but if so it is marginal and limited to 2.2
cycles. Cross-correlations between radio and optical are discussed. The lack of
a strong radio-optical correlation indicates different physical causes of
variability (ISS at long radio wavelengths, source intrinsic origin in the
optical), and is consistent with a high jet opacity and a compact synchrotron
component peaking at ~= 100 GHz in an ongoing very prominent flux density
outburst. For the campaign period, we construct a quasi-simultaneous spectral
energy distribution (SED), including gamma-ray data from the FERMI satellite.
We obtain lower limits for the relativistic Doppler-boosting of delta >= 12-26,
which for a BL\,Lac type object, is remarkably high.

that found that the spectra of the HSPs and FSRQs have significant additional

supports the hypothesis that there is a significant thermal contribution to the

for more than seventy years and the number of superheavy elements continues to

earliest scientific interest in the very heavy elements and the related
question of an upper limit of the periodic system. In the period from the 1880s
to the early 1930s, three kinds of questions appealed to a minority of
physicists, chemists and astronomers: (1) Why is uranium the heaviest known
element? (2) Do there exist transuranic or superheavy elements elsewhere in the
universe, such as in stellar interiors? (3) Is there a maximum number of
elements, corresponding to a theoretical limit for the periodic system? The
early attempts to answer or clarify these questions lacked a foundation in
nuclear physics, not to mention the total lack of experimental evidence, which
explains why most of them were of a speculative nature. Although the
speculations led no nothing, they are interesting in their own right and
deserve a place in the history of the physical sciences.

theory have distilled two families of solutions in Landau gauge. Both coincide
for high (Euclidean) momentum with known perturbation theory, and both predict
an infrared suppressed transverse gluon propagator, but whereas the solution
known as ""scaling"" features an infrared power law for the gluon and ghost
propagators, the ""massive"" solution rather describes the gluon as a vector
boson that features a finite Debye screening mass.
  In this work we examine the gauge dependence of these solutions by adopting
stochastic quantization. What we find, in four dimensions and in a rainbow
approximation, is that stochastic quantization supports both solutions in
Landau gauge but the scaling solution abruptly disappears when the parameter
controlling the drift force is separated from zero (soft gauge-fixing),
recovering only the perturbative propagators; the massive solution seems to
survive the extension outside Landau gauge. These results are consistent with
the scaling solution being related to the existence of a Gribov horizon, with
the massive one being more general.
  We also examine the effective action in Faddeev-Popov quantization that
generates the rainbow and we find, for a bare vertex approximation, that the
the massive-type solutions minimise the quantum effective action.

neutrino-driven explosions of core-collapse supernovae. By changing the
neutrino luminosity and its decay time to obtain parametric explosions in
one-(1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models with or without a 13-isotope alpha
network, we study how the inclusion of nuclear burning could affect the
postbounce dynamics for four progenitor models; three for 15.0 Msun stars, one
for an 11.2 Msun star. We find that the energy supply due to nuclear burning of
infalling material behind the shock can energize the shock expansion especially
for models that produce only marginal explosions in the absence of nuclear
burning. These models are energized by nuclear energy deposition when the shock
front passes through the silicon-rich layer and/or later it touches the
oxygen-rich layer. Depending on the neutrino luminosity and its decay time, a
diagnostic energy of explosion increases up to a few times 10^50 erg for models
with nuclear burning compared to the corresponding models without. We point out
that these features are most remarkable for the Limongi-Chieffi progenitor in
both 1D and 2D, because the progenitor model possesses a massive oxygen layer
with its inner-edge radius being smallest among the employed progenitors, so
that the shock can touch the rich fuel on a shorter timescale after bounce. The
energy difference is generally smaller (~0.1-0.2 times 10^51 erg) in 2D than in
1D (at most ~0.6 times 10^51 erg). This is because neutrino-driven convection
and the shock instability in 2D models enhance the neutrino heating efficiency,
which makes the contribution of nuclear burning relatively smaller compared to
1D models. Considering uncertainties in progenitor models, our results indicate
that nuclear burning should remain as one of the important ingredients to
foster the onset of neutrino-driven explosions.

temperature in the protoplanetary disc at the radius at which they now orbit
would have been too high for planet formation to have occurred. These planets,
instead, form at larger radii and then move into the region in which they now
orbit. The exact process that leads to the formation of these close-in planets
is, however, unclear and it seems that there may be more than one mechanism
that can produce these short-period systems. Dynamical interactions in
multiple-planet systems can scatter planets into highly eccentric orbits which,
if the pericentre is sufficiently close to the parent star, can be tidally
circularised by tidal interactions between the planet and star. Furthermore,
systems with distant planetary or stellar companions can undergo Kozai cycles
which can result in a planet orbiting very close to its parent star. However,
the most developed model for the origin of short period planets is one in which
the planet exchanges angular momentum with the surrounding protoplanetary disc
and spirals in towards the central star. In the case of 'hot Jupiters', the
planet is expected to open a gap in the disc and migrate through Type II
.migration. If this is the dominant mechanism for producing `hot Jupiters' then
we would expect the currect properties of observed close-in giant planets to be
consistent with an initial population resulting from Type II migration followed
by evolution due to tidal interactions with the central star. We consider
initial distributions that are consistent with Type II migration and find that
after tidal evolution, the final distributions can be consistent with that
observed. Our results suggest that a modest initial pile-up at a ~ 0.05 au is
required and that the initial eccentricity distribution must peak at e \sim 0.

embedded in a hydrostatic giant-like envelope. Quasi-stars are the main object

  In Chapter 3, I present models of quasi-stars where the base of the envelope
is located at the Bondi radius of the black hole. The black holes in these
models are subject to a robust upper fractional mass limit of about one tenth.
In addition, the final black hole mass is sensitive to the choice of the inner
boundary radius of the envelope. In Chapter 4, I construct alternative models
of quasi-stars by drawing from work on convection- and advection-dominated
accretion flows ... The evolution of these quasi-stars is qualitatively
different from those described in Chapter 3. ... [T]he core black holes are no

demonstrates ... that limits exist under a wider range of circumstances than
previously thought. A test is provided that determines whether a composite
polytrope is at a fractional mass limit. In Chapter 6, I apply this test to
realistic stellar models and find evidence that the existence of fractional
mass limits is connected to the evolution of stars into the red giants.

E",,"10.1103/PhysRevE.86.026206",,"nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The local density of states (LDOS) is a distribution that characterizes the
effect of perturbations on quantum systems. Recently, it was proposed a
semiclassical theory for the LDOS of chaotic billiards and maps. This theory
predicts that the LDOS is a Breit-Wigner distribution independent of the
perturbation strength and also gives a semiclassical expression for the LDOS
witdth. Here, we test the validity of such an approximation in quantum maps
varying the degree of chaoticity, the region in phase space where the
perturbation is applying and the intensity of the perturbation. We show that
for highly chaotic maps or strong perturbations the semiclassical theory of the
LDOS is accurate to describe the quantum distribution. Moreover, the width of
the LDOS is also well represented for its semiclassical expression in the case
of mixed classical dynamics.

  boundary",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the regularity up to the boundary of solutions to the Dirichlet
problem for the fractional Laplacian. We prove that if $u$ is a solution of
$(-\Delta)^s u = g$ in $\Omega$, $u \equiv 0$ in $\R^n\setminus\Omega$, for
some $s\in(0,1)$ and $g \in L^\infty(\Omega)$, then $u$ is $C^s(\R^n)$ and
$u/\delta^s|_{\Omega}$ is $C^\alpha$ up to the boundary $\partial\Omega$ for
some $\alpha\in(0,1)$, where $\delta(x)={\rm dist}(x,\partial\Omega)$. For
this, we develop a fractional analog of the Krylov boundary Harnack method.
  Moreover, under further regularity assumptions on $g$ we obtain higher order
H\""older estimates for $u$ and $u/\delta^s$. Namely, the $C^\beta$ norms of $u$
and $u/\delta^s$ in the sets $\{x\in\Omega : \delta(x)\geq\rho\}$ are
controlled by $C\rho^{s-\beta}$ and $C\rho^{\alpha-\beta}$, respectively.
  These regularity results are crucial tools in our proof of the Pohozaev
identity for the fractional Laplacian \cite{RS-CRAS,RS}.

problem $(-\Delta)^s u = f(u)$ in $\Omega$, $u \equiv 0$ in $\mathbb
R^n\setminus\Omega$. Here, $s\in(0,1)$, $(-\Delta)^s$ is the fractional
Laplacian in $\mathbb R^n$, and $\Omega$ is a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain.
  To establish the identity we use, among other things, that if $u$ is a
bounded solution then $u/\delta^s|_{\Omega}$ is $C^\alpha$ up to the boundary
$\partial\Omega$, where $\delta(x)={\rm dist}(x,\partial\Omega)$. In the
fractional Pohozaev identity, the function $u/\delta^s|_{\partial\Omega}$ plays
the role that $\partial u/\partial\nu$ plays in the classical one.
Surprisingly, from a nonlocal problem we obtain an identity with a boundary
term (an integral over $\partial\Omega$) which is completely local.
  As an application of our identity, we deduce the nonexistence of nontrivial
solutions in star-shaped domains for supercritical nonlinearities.

which obey to the usual BBGKY hierarchy, are decomposed into two contributions:
one small but strongly oscillating, the other hopefully smooth. Eliminating the
first, we arrive to establish the dynamical problem in term of a new hierarchy
(for the smooth part) involving a memory term. We show that the first order

smooth convex surface in Euclidean 3-space is less than 2. This follows from a
localization of the authors' proof of the global Caratheodory conjecture.
  The link between the two is a semi-local technique that we term ""totally real
blow-up"". Topologically, given a real surface in a complex surface, the totally
real blow-up is the connect sum of the real surface with an embedded real
projective plane. We show that this increases the sum of the complex indices of
the real surface by 1, and hence cancels isolated hyperbolic complex points.
  This leads to a reduction of the local result to the global result (the
non-existence of embedded Lagrangian surfaces with a single complex point),
which proves that the umbilic index for smooth surfaces is less than 2.
  Comparison of our smooth result with that of Hans Hamburger in the real
analytic case (stating that the index of an isolated umbilic point on a real
analytic convex surface is less than or equal to 1) suggests the existence of
""exotic"" umbilic points of index 3/2.

many respects, this phenomenon is similar to neutrino propagation through
matter. For the analysis we use the mass proportional CSL model, and perform
the calculation to second order perturbation theory. As we will show, the CSL

to their origin. The window of VHE gamma rays was opened only in 1989 by the
Whipple collaboration, reporting the observation of TeV gamma rays from the
Crab nebula. After a slow start, this new field of research is now rapidly
expanding with the discovery of more than 150 VHE gamma-ray emitting sources.
Progress is intimately related with the steady improvement of detectors and
rapidly increasing computing power. We give an overview of the early attempts
before and around 1989 and the progress after the pioneering work of the
Whipple collaboration. The main focus of this article is on the development of
experimental techniques for Earth-bound gamma-ray detectors; consequently, more
emphasis is given to those experiments that made an initial breakthrough rather
than to the successors which often had and have a similar (sometimes even
higher) scientific output as the pioneering experiments. The considered energy
threshold is about 30 GeV. At lower energies, observations can presently only
be performed with balloon or satellite-borne detectors. Irrespective of the
stormy experimental progress, the success story could not have been called a
success story without a broad scientific output. Therefore we conclude this
article with a summary of the scientific rationales and main results achieved
over the last two decades.

density is independent of the specific amounts of charge and mass and of order
the Planck density. We discuss the physical implications of these results for
astrophysical and microscopic black holes, construct the Penrose diagrams of
some illustrative cases, and show that the maximal analytical extension of the
nonsingular solutions implies a bounce of the radial coordinate.

in the sky down to a broad band magnitude limit of G=20, an expected yield of
10^9 stars. Its main scientific objective is to reveal the formation and
evolution of our Galaxy through chemo-dynamical analysis. In addition to
inferring positions, parallaxes and proper motions from the astrometry, we must
also infer the astrophysical parameters of the stars from the
spectrophotometry, the BP/RP spectrum. Here we investigate the performance of
three different algorithms (SVM, ILIUM, Aeneas) for estimating the effective
temperature, line-of-sight interstellar extinction, metallicity and surface
gravity of A-M stars over a wide range of these parameters and over the full
magnitude range Gaia will observe (G=6-20mag). One of the algorithms, Aeneas,
infers the posterior probability density function over all parameters, and can
optionally take into account the parallax and the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram
to improve the estimates. For all algorithms the accuracy of estimation depends
on G and on the value of the parameters themselves, so a broad summary of
performance is only approximate. For stars at G=15 with less than two
magnitudes extinction, we expect to be able to estimate Teff to within 1%, logg
to 0.1-0.2dex, and [Fe/H] (for FGKM stars) to 0.1-0.2dex, just using the BP/RP
spectrum (mean absolute error statistics are quoted). Performance degrades at
larger extinctions, but not always by a large amount. Extinction can be
estimated to an accuracy of 0.05-0.2mag for stars across the full parameter
range with a priori unknown extinction between 0 and 10mag. Performance
degrades at fainter magnitudes, but even at G=19 we can estimate logg to better
than 0.2dex for all spectral types, and [Fe/H] to within 0.35dex for FGKM
stars, for extinctions below 1mag.

In this paper, we significantly improve the output fidelity of remotely
entangled atoms by introducing one additional entanglement protocol in each of
the repeater nodes and by optimizing the laser beams required to control the
entire scheme. Our improved distillation scheme yields an almost unit output
fidelity that, together with the entanglement distribution and swapping, opens
an attractive route towards an efficient and experimentally feasible quantum

that for the fast solution, the mass loss rate is increased by a factor \sim
10%, while the terminal velocity is reduced about 10%, when compared with the
solution using a finite disk correction factor from a uniformly bright star.
For the other two slow solutions the changes are almost negligible. Although,
we found that the limb darkening has no effects on the wind momentum luminosity
relationship, it would affect the calculation of synthetic line profiles and

jamming onset, with the number of constraints (contacts) equal to the number of
degrees of freedom. Their structural and mechanical properties are controlled
by the interparticle contact network. In contrast, amorphous packings of
frictional particles are typically hyperstatic at jamming onset. We perform
extensive numerical simulations in two dimensions of the geometrical asperity
(GA) model for static friction, to further investigate the role of
isostaticity. In the GA model, interparticle forces are obtained by summing up
purely repulsive central forces between periodically spaced circular asperities
on contacting grains. We compare the packing fraction, contact number,
mobilization distribution, and vibrational density of states using the GA model
to those generated using the Cundall-Strack (CS) approach. We find that static
packings of frictional disks obtained from the GA model are mechanically stable
and isostatic when we consider interactions between asperities on contacting
particles. The crossover in the structural and mechanical properties of static
packings from frictionless to frictional behavior as a function of the static
friction coefficient coincides with a change in the type of interparticle
contacts and the disappearance of a peak in the density of vibrational modes
for the GA model. These results emphasize that mesoscale features of the model
for static friction play an important role in determining the properties of
granular packings.

cameras which are currently limited in contrast, sensitivity and astrometric
precision, but advantageously observe in the near-IR (1- 5{\mu}m). Because of
these practical limitations, our current observational aim at detecting and
characterizing planets puts heavy constraints on target selection, observing
strategies, data reduction, and follow-up. Most surveys so far have thus
targeted young systems (1-100Myr) to catch the putative remnant thermal
radiation of giant planets, which peaks in the near-IR. They also favor systems
in the solar neighborhood (d<80pc), which eases angular resolution requirements
but also ensures a good knowledge of the distance and proper motion, which are
critical to secure the planet status, and enable subsequent characterization.
Because of their youth, it is very tempting to target the nearby star forming
regions, which are typically twice as far as the bulk of objects usually combed
for planets by direct imaging. Probing these interesting reservoirs sets
additional constraints that we review in this paper by presenting the planet
search that we initiated in 2008 around the disk-bearing T Tauri star IM Lup
(Lupus star forming region, 140-190pc). We show and discuss why age
determination, the choice of evolutionary model for the central star and the
planet, precise knowledge of the host star proper motion, relative or absolute
astrometric accuracy, and patience are the key ingredients for exoplanet
searches around more distant young stars. Unfortunately, most of the time,
precision and perseverance are not paying off: we discovered a candidate
companion around IM Lup in 2008, which we report here to be an unbound
background object. We nevertheless review in details the lessons learned from
our endeavor, and additionally present the best detection limits ever
calculated for IM Lup.

liquid-like state and a ordered solid-like one, in a collection of magnetically
interacting macroscopic grains. A monolayer of magnetized particles is vibrated
vertically at a moderate density. At high excitation a disordered, liquid-like
state is observed. When the driving dimensionless acceleration $\Gamma$ is
quasi-statically reduced, clusters of ordered grains grow below a critical
value $\Gamma_{\rm c}$. These clusters have a well defined hexagonal and
compact structure. If the driving is subsequently increased, these clusters
remain stable up to a higher critical value $\Gamma_{\rm l}$. Thus, the
solid-liquid transition exhibits an hysteresis cycle. However, the lower onset
$\Gamma_c$ is not well defined as it depends strongly on the acceleration ramp
speed and also on the magnetic interaction strength. Metastability is observed
when the driving is rapidly quenched from high acceleration, $\Gamma >
\Gamma_{\rm l}$, to a low final excitation $\Gamma_q$. After this quench, solid
clusters nucleate after a time lag $\tau_o$, either immediately ($\tau_o = 0$)
or after some time lag ($\tau_o>0$) that can vary from seconds up to several
hundreds of seconds. The immediate growth occurs below a particular
acceleration value $\Gamma_s$ ($\lesssim \Gamma_c$). In all cases, for $t \geq
\tau_o$ solid cluster's temporal growth can be phenomenologically described by
a stretched exponential law. Finally, by taking into account the finite size of
our system and by using simple assumptions we propose an alternative tractable
theoretical model that reproduces cluster's growth, but which analytical form
is not a stretched exponential law.

insulators, Mott insulators often possess orbital degrees of freedom when

that the SU(4) symmetric Kugel-Khomskii model on the honeycomb lattice is a
quantum spin-orbital liquid. The absence of any form of symmetry breaking -
lattice or SU(N) - is supported by a combination of semiclassical and numerical
approaches: flavor-wave theory, tensor network algorithm, and exact
diagonalizations. In addition, all properties revealed by these methods are
very accurately accounted for by a projected variational wave-function based on
the \pi-flux state of fermions on the honeycomb lattice at 1/4-filling. In that
state, correlations are algebraic because of the presence of a Dirac point at
the Fermi level, suggesting that the symmetric Kugel-Khomskii model on the
honeycomb lattice is an algebraic quantum spin-orbital liquid. This model
provides a good starting point to understand the recently discovered
spin-orbital liquid behavior of Ba_3CuSb_2O_9. The present results also suggest
to choose optical lattices with honeycomb geometry in the search for quantum

in 2009 show two consecutive eclipses over the 29d orbit, with varying depths.
A subsequent MOST run in 2010 showed a seemingly asymmetric eclipse profile. In
order to help make sense of these observations, parallel optical spectroscopy
was obtained from the Mont Megantic Observatory (2009, 2010) and from the
Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (2009). Assuming these depth variations are
entirely due to electron scattering in a beta-law wind, an unprecedented 62%
increase in mass-loss rate is observed over one orbital period. Alternatively,
no change in mass-loss rate would be required if a relatively small fraction of
the carbon ions in the wind globally recombined and coaggulated to form carbon
dust grains. However, it remains a mystery as to how this could occur. There
also seems to be evidence for the presence of corotating interaction regions

continually changing, and ungoverned, it has often been criticised for
lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching. To address this
issue, a variety of approaches have been proposed that recommend users what
tags to use, both when labeling and when looking for resources. These
techniques work well in dense folksonomies, but they fail to do so when tag
usage exhibits a power law distribution, as it often happens in real-life
folksonomies. To tackle this issue, we propose an approach that induces the
creation of a dense folksonomy, in a fully automatic and transparent way: when
users label resources, an innovative tag similarity metric is deployed, so to
enrich the chosen tag set with related tags already present in the folksonomy.
The proposed metric, which represents the core of our approach, is based on the
mutual reinforcement principle. Our experimental evaluation proves that the
accuracy and coverage of searches guaranteed by our metric are higher than
those achieved by applying classical metrics.

of a quantum system can be determined reliably and efficiently from general
quantum measurements. One important class of measurements for this purpose is
symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measurements
(SIC-POVMs). SIC-POVMs have the advantage of providing an unbiased estimator
for the quantum state with the minimal number of outcomes needed for full
tomography. By virtue of Naimark's dilation theorem, any POVM can always be
realized with a suitable coupling between the system and an auxiliary system
and by performing a projective measurement on the joint system. In practice,
finding the appropriate coupling is rather non-trivial. Here we propose an
experimental design for directly implementing SIC-POVMs using multiport devices
and path-encoded qubits and qutrits, the utility of which has recently been
demonstrated by several experimental groups around the world. Furthermore, we
describe how these multiports can be attained in practice with an integrated
photonic system composed of nested linear optical elements.

off base stations in case of cooperating service providers by means of
stochastic geometric and coalitional game tools. The coalitional game herein
considered is played by service providers who cooperate in switching off base
stations. When they cooperate, any mobile is associated to the nearest BS of
any service provider. Given a Poisson point process deployment model of nodes
over an area and switching off base stations with some probability, it is
proved that the distribution of signal to interference plus noise ratio remains
unchanged while the transmission power is increased up to preserving the
quality of service. The coalitional game behavior of a typical player is called
to be \emph{hedonic} if the gain of any player depends solely on the members of
the coalition to which the player belongs, thus, the coalitions form as a
result of the preferences of the players over their possible coalitions' set.
We also introduce a novel concept which is called the Nash-stable core
containing those gain allocation methods that result in Nash-stable partitions.
By this way, we always guarantee Nash stability. We study the non-emptiness of
the Nash-stable core. Assuming the choice of a coalition is performed only by
one player in a point of time, we prove that the Nash-stable core is non-empty
when a player chooses its coalition in its turn, the player gains zero utility
if the chosen coalition is visited before by itself.

  Quasiaverages, Quantum Protectorate and Emergence","19 p. Invited talk, presented at XLVIII All-Russia Conference on
  Problems in Particle Physics, Plasma Physics, Condensed Matter, and
  Optoelectronics, which was held in Moscow 15 - 18 May 2012, Russia. The
  Conference was dedicated to the 100th anniversary of Professor Yakov
  Petrovich Terletsky (1912 - 1993)",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the present paper we discuss the interrelation of the advanced
interdisciplinary concepts of modern physics such as symmetry breaking, quantum
protectorate, emergence and the Bogoliubov's concept of quasiaverages in the
context of modern theoretical physics, and, in particular, quantum and
statistical physics. The main aim of this analysis was to demonstrate the
connection and interrelation of these conceptual advances of the many-particle
physics and to try to show explicitly that those concepts, though different in
details, have certain common features. Some problems in the field of
statistical physics of complex materials and systems e.g. foundation of the
microscopic theory of magnetism and superconductivity were pointed in relation
to these ideas. The main suggestion is that the emphasis of symmetry breaking
concept is on the symmetry itself, whereas the method of quasiaverages
emphasizes the degeneracy of a system. The concept of quantum protectorate
reveals essential difference in the behavior of the complex many-body systems
at the low-energy and high-energy scales. Thus the notion of quantum
protectorate might provide distinctive signatures and good criteria for a
hierarchy of energy scales and the appropriate emergent behavior.

""vector-like"" gauge theories with massless fermions in $d$-dimensional
Minkowski space and, under a few reasonable assumptions, determine the form of
the quadratic fermion condensates which arise through spontaneous breaking of
these symmetries. We find that for each type (complex, real, or pseudoreal) of
representation of the gauge group carried by the fermions, the chiral
symmetries of the Lagrangian, as well as the residual symmetries after
dynamical breaking, exactly follow the pattern of Bott periodicity as the
dimension changes. The consequences of this for the topological features of the
low-energy effective theory are considered.

Kasner in the multidimensional spacetime. Influence of metric effects leads to
renormalization of main parameters of the fields in the Lagrangian, and new
mass and charge terms are introduced to corresponding observed in reality
values. Effective masses and charge of the fields depend upon the additional
terms with cosmological constant. Was calculated the expressions for the
effective mass and charge of the fields in anisotropic spacetime.

predominant form of electronic interaction between individuals. In an attempt
to harness the power of the large user base which they have managed to attract,
this study proposes an e-learning prototype which integrates concepts of the
social and semantic web. A selected set of services are deployed which have
been scientifically proven to positively impact the learning process of users
via electronic means. The integrability of these services into a social network
platform application is visualized through an exploratory prototype. The
Graphical User Interface (GUI) which is developed to implement these key
features is in alignment with User-Centered principles. The designed prototype
proves that a number of services can be integrated in a user-friendly
application and can potentially serve to gain feedback regarding additional
aspects that should be included.

  integrators for dynamical systems","2 figures",,,,"math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new approach for the construction of high order A-stable explicit
integrators for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is theoretically
studied. Basically, the integrators are obtained by splitting, at each time
step, the solution of the original equation in two parts: the solution of a
linear ordinary differential equation plus the solution of an auxiliary ODE.
The first one is solved by a Local Linearization scheme in such a way that
A-stability is ensured, while the second one can be approximated by any extant
scheme, preferably a high order explicit Runge-Kutta scheme. Results on the
convergence and dynamical properties of this new class of schemes are given, as
well as some hints for their efficient numerical implementation. An specific
scheme of this new class is derived in detail, and its performance is compared
with some Matlab codes in the integration of a variety of ODEs representing
different types of dynamics.
