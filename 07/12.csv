reliable signal adaptive embedding scheme for multiple messages in selective
sub-bands of wavelet (DWT) coefficients using direct sequence spread spectrum
(DS-SS) modulation technique. Here the impact of volumetric distortion sources
is analyzed on the ability of analytical bounds in order to recover the
watermark messages. In this context, the joint source-channel coding scheme has
been employed to obtain the better control of the system robustness. This
structure prevents the desynchronisation between encoder and decoder due to
selective embedding. The experimental results obtained for Spread Spectrum (SS)

clouds still lack an explanation, despite extensive research that includes both
gas and solid (dust-grain surface) phase reactions. Aims. We aim to
qualitatively prove the idea that a hydrogen-poor subsurface chemistry on
interstellar grains is responsible for at least some of these chemical
""anomalies"". This chemistry develops in the icy mantles when photodissociation
reactions in the mantle release free hydrogen, which escapes the mantle via
diffusion. This results in serious alterations of the chemical composition of
the mantle because pores in the mantle provide surfaces for reactions in the
new, hydrogen-poor environment. Methods. We present a simple kinetic model,
using existing astrochemical reaction databases. Gas phase, surface and
subsurface pore reactions are included, as are physical transformations of
molecules. Results. Our model produces significantly higher abundances for
various oxidized species than most other models. We also obtain quite good
results for some individual species that have adequate reaction network. Thus,
we consider that the hydrogen-poor mantle chemistry may indeed play a role in
the chemical evolution of molecular clouds. Conclusions. The significance of
outward hydrogen diffusion has to be proved by further research. A huge number
of solid phase reactions between many oxidized species is essential to obtain
good, quantitative modeling results for a comparison with observations. We
speculate that a variety of unobservable hydrogen-poor sulfur oxoacid
derivatives may be responsible for the ""disappearance"" of sulfur in dark cloud
cores.

systems is developed using techniques from optimization and statistical
estimation. As in standard projection operator methods, a set of resolved
variables is selected to capture the slow, macroscopic behavior of the system,
and the family of quasi-equilibrium probability densities on phase space
corresponding to these resolved variables is employed as a statistical model.
The macroscopic dynamics of the mean resolved variables is determined by
optimizing over paths of these probability densities. Specifically, a cost
function is introduced that quantifies the lack-of-fit of such paths to the
underlying microscopic dynamics; it is an ensemble-averaged, squared-norm of
the residual that results from submitting a path of trial densities to the
Liouville equation. The evolution of the macrostate is estimated by minimizing
the time integral of the cost function. The value function for this
optimization satisfies the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation, and it
determines the optimal relation between the statistical parameters and the
irreversible fluxes of the resolved variables, thereby closing the reduced
dynamics. The resulting equations for the macroscopic variables have the
generic form of governing equations for nonequilibrium thermodynamics, and they
furnish a rational extension of the classical equations of linear irreversible
thermodynamics beyond the near-equilibrium regime. In particular, the value
function is a thermodynamic potential that extends the classical dissipation
function and supplies the nonlinear relation between thermodynamics forces and
fluxes.

spectra of stellar-mass black holes, including a thermal peak and all the
features associated with strong hard X-ray emission: a power-law extending to
high energies, a Compton reflection hump, and a broad iron line. Varying only
the mass accretion rate, we are able to reproduce a wide range of X-ray states

~ 10 keV in a boundary layer near the disk and rises smoothly to T_e >~ 100 keV

that the shape of the Fe K\alpha line is remarkably constant. This is because
photons emitted from the plunging region are strongly beamed into the horizon

near maximum light, for which SN 1991T supplies the best phase coverage among

the velocity plateaus as evidence for a reverse-shock shell in the ejecta
formed by interaction at early times with a compact envelope of surrounding
material, as might be expected for SNe resulting from the mergers of two white
dwarfs. We use the bolometric light curves and line velocity evolution of these
SNe to estimate important parameters of the progenitor systems, including
nickel-56 mass, total progenitor mass, and masses of shells and surrounding
carbon/oxygen envelopes. We find that the reconstructed total progenitor mass

Chandrasekhar mass, with SN 2007if being the most massive. We discuss the
relationship of these events to the emerging class of super-Chandrasekhar-mass

resolved the galaxy into single stars and this has led to the derivation of its
star formation history and to a direct estimate of its stellar mass. We have
analysed archival VLA observations of the 21 cm line and found that UGC 4483
has a steeply-rising rotation curve which flattens in the outer parts at a
velocity of ~20 km/s. Radial motions of ~5 km/s may also be present. As far as
we know, UGC 4483 is the lowest-mass galaxy with a differentially rotating HI
disk. The steep rise of the rotation curve indicates that there is a strong
central concentration of mass. We have built mass models using the HST
information on the stellar mass to break the disk-halo degeneracy: old stars
contribute ~50$%$ of the observed rotation velocity at 2.2 disk scale-lengths.
Baryons (gas and stars) constitute an important fraction of the total dynamical
mass. These are striking differences with respect to typical dwarf irregular
galaxies (dIrrs), which usually have slowly-rising rotation curves and are
thought to be entirely dominated by dark matter. BCDs appear to be different
from non-starbursting dIrrs in terms of their HI and stellar distributions and
their internal dynamics. To their high central surface brightnesses and high
central HI densities correspond strong central rotation-velocity gradients.
This implies that the starburst is closely related with the gravitational
potential and the concentration of gas. We discuss the implications of our
results on the properties of the progenitors/descendants of BCDs.

exhibited retrograde precession during this superoutburst, contrary to all

shorter than those of ordinary superoutbursts and the intervals of normal

second is Secure Optimized Route Management (S-ORM) to maintain optimum route.
These algorithms proposed with cryptographic integrity of the secure route

opaque region of an ultra-relativistic jet. Recent radiative transfer
calculations support this picture and show that the spectral peak is inherited
from initially thermal radiation, which is changed by heating into a broad
photon distribution with a high-energy tail. We discuss the processes that
regulate the observed position of the spectral peak E_pk. The opaque jet has
three radial zones: (1) Planck zone r<R_P where a blackbody spectrum is
enforced; this zone ends where Thomson optical depth decreases to tau~10^5. (2)
Wien zone R_P<r<R_W with Kompaneets parameter y>>1 where radiation has a
Bose-Einstein spectrum, and (3) Comptonization zone r>R_W where the radiation
spectrum develops the high-energy tail. Besides the initial jet temperature, an
important factor regulating E_pk is internal dissipation (of bulk motions and
magnetic energy) at large distances from the central engine. Dissipation in the
Planck zone reduces E_pk, and dissipation in the Wien zone increases E_pk. In
jets with sub-dominant magnetic fields, the predicted E_pk varies around 1 MeV
up to a maximum value of about 10 MeV. If the jet carries an energetically
important magnetic field, E_pk can be additionally increased by dissipation of
magnetic energy. This increase is hinted by observations, which show E_pk up to
about 20 MeV. We also consider magnetically dominated jets; then a simple model
of magnetic dissipation gives E_pk~30 Gamma_W keV where Gamma_W is the jet
Lorentz factor at the Wien radius R_W.

is analyzed. The mobile locations may be drawn from any spatial distribution,
and interference-avoidance protocols or protection against physical collisions
among the mobiles may be modeled by placing an exclusion zone around each
radio. The channel model accounts for the path loss, Nakagami fading, and
shadowing of each received signal. The Nakagami m-parameter can vary among the
mobiles, taking any positive value for each of the interference signals and any
positive integer value for the desired signal. The analysis is governed by a
new exact expression for the outage probability, defined to be the probability
that the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) drops below a threshold,
and is conditioned on the network geometry and shadowing factors, which have
dynamics over much slower timescales than the fading. By averaging over many
network and shadowing realizations, the average outage probability and
transmission capacity are computed. Using the analysis, many aspects of the
network performance are illuminated. For example, one can determine the
influence of the choice of spreading factors, the effect of the receiver
location within the finite network region, and the impact of both the fading
parameters and the attenuation power laws.

typical of uniformity-driven orderings, which only requires the knowledge of
the modulation vectors observed in the diffraction patterns. The idea is
discussed in terms of a simple two dimensional lattice-gas model that simulates
a binary system in which the dilution of the minority component is favored.
This simple model already exhibits a hierarchy of arrangements similar to the

described as occupational modulated structures with two independent modulation
wave vectors and simple step-like occupation modulation functions.

light of RSD. (1) We propose a mathematically unique and physically motivated
decomposition of peculiar velocity into three eigen-components of different
origins, different scale dependences and different impacts on RSD. (2) This
decomposition has the potential to simplify and improve the RSD modeling. We
derive a new formula for the redshift space power spectrum. Under the velocity
decomposition scheme, all high order Gaussian corrections and non-Gaussian
correction of order $\delta^3$ can be taken into account without introducing
extra model uncertainties. We find that the leading order contribution $\propto
(1+f\tilde{W}(k)u^2)^2$ differs from the Kaiser formula by a function
$\tilde{W}(k)\leq 1$. We hence identify a significant systematic error causing
underestimation of the structure growth parameter $f$ by as much as $O(10%)$
even at relatively large scale $k=0.1h/$Mpc. The velocity decomposition also
reveals the three origins of the finger of God (FOG) effect. (3) The velocity
decomposition clarifies issues in peculiar velocity reconstruction through 3D
galaxy distribution. We discuss two possible ways to carry out the velocity
reconstruction. Both use the otherwise troublesome RSD in velocity
reconstruction as a valuable source of information. Both have the advantage to
render the reconstruction of a stochastic 3D field into the reconstruction of a

luminous (L>L*), spectroscopically confirmed, galaxies in the redshift interval
5.5<z<6.5, all with WFC3/IR and IRAC imaging from the HST/CANDELS and
Spitzer/SEDS surveys. Based on fitting the observed photometry with SED
templates covering a wide range of different star-formation histories, and a
self consistent treatment of Lyman-alpha emission, we find that the derived
stellar masses lie within the range 10^9 Msun < M*< 10^10 Msun and are robust
to within a factor of two. In contrast, we confirm previous reports that the
ages of the stellar populations are poorly constrained. Although the
best-fitting models for three objects have ages >= 300 Myr, the degeneracies
introduced by dust extinction mean that only two of these objects actually
require a >300 Myr old stellar population to reproduce the observed photometry.
Moreover, when considering only smoothly-varying star-formation histories, we
observe a clear tension between the data and models such that a galaxy SED
template with an old age is often chosen in order to try and fit objects with
blue UV-slopes but red UV-to-optical colours. To break this tension we explore
SED fitting with two-component models (burst plus on-going star-formation) and
allow for nebular emission. On average, the inclusion of nebular emission leads
to lower stellar-mass estimates (median offset 0.18 dex), moderately higher
specific star-formation rates, and allows for a wider range of plausible
stellar ages. However, based on our SED modelling, we find no strong evidence
for extremely young ages in our sample (<50 Myr). Finally, considering all of
the different star-formation histories explored, we find that the median
best-fitting ages are of the order 200-300 Myr and that the objects with the
tightest constraints indicate ages in the range 50-200 Myr (Abridged).

galaxies, HI scaling appears to fail in the outer parts, possibly due to
observational effects or ionization of the HI. The overall success of the
baryonic scaling model suggests that the well-known global coupling between the
baryonic mass of a galaxy and its rotation velocity (known as the baryonic
Tully-Fisher relation), applies at a more local level as well, and it seems to
imply a link between the baryonic mass distribution and the distribution of

Using the Keldysh technique combined with standard impurity averaging methods

free path), we consider both scalar potential (i.e. deformation potential) and
vector potential couplings between electrons and phonons. We also consider the

temperature dependence of the heat flux and thermal conductance is sensitive to
the presence of disorder and screening, and reflects the underlying chiral
nature of electrons in graphene and the corresponding modification of their
diffusive behaviour. In the case of weak screening, disorder enhances the
low-temperature heat flux over the clean system (changing the associated power
law from $T^4$ to $T^3$), and the deformation potential dominates. For strong
screening, both the deformation potential and vector potential couplings make
comparable contributions, and the low-temperature heat flux obeys a $T^5$ power

interactions with a gas-dominated disk, is studied in the context of evolved
solar nebula models. The planets' masses, M1 and M2, correspond to those of
Jupiter and Saturn. Hydrodynamical calculations in two and three dimensions are
used to quantify the migration rates and analyze the conditions under which the
outward migration mechanism may operate. The planets are taken to be fully
formed after 1e6 and before 3e6 years. The orbital evolution of the planets in
an evolving disk is then calculated until the disk's gas is completely
dissipated. Orbital locking in the 3:2 mean motion resonance may lead to
outward migration under appropriate conditions of disk viscosity and
temperature. However, resonance locking does not necessarily result in outward
migration. This is the case, for example, if convergent migration leads to
locking in the 2:1 mean motion resonance, as post-formation disk conditions
seem to suggest. Accretion of gas on the planets may deactivate the outward
migration mechanism by raising the mass ratio M2/M1 and/or by reducing the
accretion rate toward the star, hence depleting the inner disk. For migrating
planets locked in the 3:2 mean motion resonance, there are stalling radii that
depend on disk viscosity and on stellar irradiation, when it determines the
disk's thermal balance. Planets locked in the 3:2 orbital resonance that start
moving outward from within 1-2 AU may reach beyond 5 AU only under favorable
conditions. However, within the explored space of disk parameters, only a small
fraction - less than a few per cent - of the models predict that the interior
planet reaches beyond 4 AU.

This very low surface brightness object, HCC-087, was originally classified as
an early-type dwarf in the Hydra Cluster Catalogue (HCC), but our re-analysis
of the ESO-VLT/FORS images of the HCC unearthed a clear indication of an
S-shaped morphology and a large spatial extent. Its shape, luminosity
(M_V=-11.6 mag), and physical size (at a half-light radius of 3.1 kpc and a
full length of ~5.9 kpc) are comparable to the recently discovered NGC 4449B
and the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal, all of which are undergoing clear tidal
disruption. Aided by N-body simulations we argue that HCC-087 is currently at
its first apocenter, at 150 kpc, around the cluster center and that it is being
tidally disrupted by the galaxy cluster's potential itself. An interaction with
the near-by (50 kpc) S0 cluster galaxy HCC-005, at M* ~ 3 x 10^10 M_sun is
rather unlikely, as this constellation requires a significant amount of
dynamical friction and thus low relative velocities. The S-shaped morphology
and large spatial extent of the satellite would, however, also appear if
HCC-087 would orbit the cluster center. These features appear to be
characteristic properties of satellites that are seen in the process of being
tidally disrupted, independent of the environment of the destruction. An
important finding of our simulations is an orientation of the tidal tails
perpendicular to the orbit.

Tachyons consistent with the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound are generically
present, and although these tachyons cannot destabilize the supersymmetric
vacuum, they do influence the likelihood of the existence of an `uplift' to a
metastable vacuum with positive cosmological constant. We show that the
probability that a supersymmetric AdS vacuum has no tachyons is formally
equivalent to the probability of a large fluctuation of the smallest eigenvalue
of a certain real Wishart matrix. For normally-distributed matrix entries and
any N, this probability is given exactly by P = exp(-2N^2|W|^2/m_{susy}^2),
with W denoting the superpotential and m_{susy} the supersymmetric mass scale;
for more general distributions of the entries, our result is accurate when N >>

most widely used parametrization is the so-called ""Mixing Length Theory"" where
the convective eddy sizes are described using a single number, \alpha, the
mixing-length parameter. This is a free parameter, and the general practice is
to calibrate \alpha using the known properties of the Sun and apply that to all
stars. Using data from NASA's Kepler mission we show that using the
solar-calibrated \alpha is not always appropriate, and that in many cases it
would lead to estimates of initial helium abundances that are lower than the
primordial helium abundance. Kepler data allow us to calibrate \alpha for many
other stars and we show that for the sample of stars we have studied, the
mixing-length parameter is generally lower than the solar value. We studied the
correlation between \alpha and stellar properties, and we find that \alpha
increases with metallicity. We therefore conclude that results obtained by
fitting stellar models or by using population-synthesis models constructed with
solar values of \alpha are likely to have large systematic errors. Our results
also confirm theoretical expectations that the mixing-length parameter should
vary with stellar properties.

significant substructure in it. We distinguish 4 structures that are separated

with a core of elliptical galaxies that coincides with (weak) X-ray emission,
almost no HI-detections, and suppressed star formation. Surrounding the
cluster, we find a compact group where galaxies pre-process before falling into
the cluster, and a scattered population of ""field-like"" galaxies showing more
star formation and HI-detections. This cluster proves to be an excellent
laboratory to understand the fate of the HI gas in the framework of galaxy
evolution. We clearly see that the HI gas and the star formation correlate with
morphology and environment at z=0.2. In particular, the fraction of
HI-detections is significantly affected by the environment. The effect starts
to kick in in low mass groups that pre-process the galaxies before they enter

presents a strong likelihood that Tucana, Cetus, NGC3109, SextansA, SextansB,

their morphology, star formation history and/or gas content indicative of
evolution seen in simulations of satellite/parent galactic interactions. Our

form a sequence in morphology and gas content, with evolution along the

their stars go through the RGB or asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stages, many of

increase their atmospheric temperatures to ~1000 K or more. Furthermore,
massive planets around post-main-sequence stars could accrete a non-negligible

altering their atmospheric chemistry as well as causing a significant accretion

account of possible Q-ball formation. We show that the baryon asymmetry of the
present Universe can be generated by the Affleck-Dine mechanism in LARGE volume
scenario, solving the moduli and gravitino problems. We also find that the
overall volume modulus decays into a pair of the axionic superpartners, which
contribute to the extra relativistic degrees of freedom.

haloes in order to remove centrally-divergent DM cusps on scales relevant to
observations of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). We estimate that the CDM
haloes often associated with the Milky Way's dSphs (M_vir/M_\odot \sim
10^{9-10}) require \Delta E/erg \sim 10^{53-55} in order to form cores on
scales comparable to the luminous size of these galaxies. While supernova type
II (SNeII) explosions can in principle generate this energy, the actual
contribution is limited by the low star formation efficiency implied by the
abundance of luminous satellites. Considering that CDM's well-known `core/cusp'
and `missing satellite' problems place opposing demands on star formation
efficiencies, existing observational evidences for large cores in the most
luminous dSphs require that CDM models invoke some combination of the
following: (i) efficient (of order unity) coupling of SNeII energy into dark
matter particles, (ii) star formation histories peaking at unexpectedly high
redshifts (z>6), (iii) a top-heavy stellar IMF, and/or (iv) substantial
satellite disruption or other stochastic effects to ease the substructure
abundance constraints. Our models show that the tension between CDM problems on
small scales would increase if cored DM profiles were to be found in fainter
dwarves.

strictly limited by the number of transmit antennas $N$ and the use of these
antennas. Assuming that the total number of receive antennas at the
multi-antenna users is much larger than $N$, the maximal multiplexing gain can
be achieved with many different transmission/reception strategies. For example,
the excess number of receive antennas can be utilized to schedule users with
effective channels that are near-orthogonal, for multi-stream multiplexing to
users with well-conditioned channels, and/or to enable interference-aware
receive combining. In this paper, we try to answer the question if the $N$ data
streams should be divided among few users (many streams per user) or many users
(few streams per user, enabling receive combining). Analytic results are
derived to show how user selection, spatial correlation, heterogeneous user
conditions, and imperfect channel acquisition (quantization or estimation
errors) affect the performance when sending the maximal number of streams or
one stream per scheduled user---the two extremes in data stream allocation.
  While contradicting observations on this topic have been reported in prior
works, we show that selecting many users and allocating one stream per user
(i.e., exploiting receive combining) is the best candidate under realistic
conditions. This is explained by the provably stronger resilience towards
spatial correlation and the larger benefit from multi-user diversity. This
fundamental result has positive implications for the design of downlink systems
as it reduces the hardware requirements at the user devices and simplifies the
throughput optimization.

fast rotation causes spectral features to be washed out, stars with low

of neutral atomic lines reported in Mclean et al. 2007. We also calculated
pseudo-equivalent widths (p-EW) of 12 atomic lines. Our results confirm that
the p-EW of K I lines are strongly dependent on spectral types. We observe that

is commensurable with stereoscopic measurement errors ($\mu_{SE} \approx

line-of-sight magnetogram into three magnetic field components $(B_x, B_y,
B_z)$, as well as a non-potential field forward-fitting code that determines
the full length of twisted loops ($L \approx 50-300$ Mm), the number of twist
turns (median $N_{twist}=0.06$), the nonlinear force-free $\alpha$-parameter

to be far below the critical value for kink instability, and Joule dissipation
of their currents is found be be far below the coronal heating requirement. The
algorithm developed here, based on an analytical solution of nonlinear
force-free fields that is accurate to second order (in the force-free parameter

detected in CO line emission at the 3-4 sigma level. We find CO luminosities of

our observations. We limit our search to galaxies with K<23.5 (AB) and
z_phot=1.2-1.8. We find 2 bright optical galaxies to be associated with

performed a parallel search for line peaks using a Bayesian inference method.

to olfactory reception, specifically in the spectral region around 2300

specifically those modes that are resonant with the tunneling gap. By
projecting the impulsive force onto the internal modes, we can determine which
modes are excited at a given value of the donor-acceptor tunneling gap. Only
those modes resonant with the tunneling gap and are impulsively excited will
give a significant contribution to the inelastic transfer rate. Using
acetophenone as a test case, our model and experiments on D. melanogaster
suggest that isotopomers of a given olfactant give rise to different odorant
qualities. These results support the notion that inelastic scattering effects
play a role in discriminating between isotopomers, but that this is not a

while the layer-oriented approach benefits from larger fields - and will
therefore be an attractive solution for the future generation of solar MCAO

To follow the slow evolution of subsonic motions, various sound-proof equations
are in wide use, particularly in stellar astrophysical fluid dynamics. These
low-Mach number equations include the anelastic equations. Generally, these
equations are valid in nearly adiabatically stratified regions like stellar
convection zones, but may not be valid in the sub-adiabatic, stably stratified
stellar radiative interiors. Understanding the coupling between the convection
zone and the radiative interior is a problem of crucial interest and may have
strong implications for solar and stellar dynamo theories as the interface
between the two, called the tachocline in the Sun, plays a crucial role in many
solar dynamo theories. Here we study the properties of gravity waves in
stably-stratified atmospheres. In particular, we explore how gravity waves are
handled in various sound-proof equations. We find that some anelastic
treatments fail to conserve energy in stably-stratified atmospheres, instead
conserving pseudo-energies that depend on the stratification, and we
demonstrate this numerically. One anelastic equation set does conserve energy

collective modes in two-component atomic Fermi gases with s-wave attraction and
synthetic Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The general effective action for the
collective modes is derived from the functional path integral formalism. By
tuning the spin-orbit coupling from weak to strong, the system undergoes a
crossover from an ordinary BCS/BEC superfluid to a Bose-Einstein condensate of
rashbons. We show that the properties of the superfluid density and the
Anderson-Bogoliubov mode manifest this crossover. At large spin-orbit coupling,
the superfluid density and the sound velocity become independent of the
strength of the s-wave attraction. The two-body interaction among the rashbons
is also determined. When a Zeeman field is turned on, the system undergoes
quantum phase transitions to some exotic superfluid phases which are
topologically nontrivial. For the two-dimensional system, the nonanalyticities
of the thermodynamic functions and the sound velocity across the phase
transition are related to the bulk gapless fermionic excitation which causes
infrared singularities. The superfluid density and the sound velocity behave
nonmonotonically: they are suppressed by the Zeeman field in the normal
superfluid phase, but get enhanced in the topological superfluid phase. The
three-dimensional system is also studied.

the host galaxy, obtained 17-18 yr prior to the explosion, and near-infrared
ground-based images, obtained 6-12 yr prior to the SN. The luminous supergiant
showed evidence for substantial circumstellar dust, manifested as excess
line-of-sight extinction. The effective total-to-selective ratio of extinction
to the star was R'_V \approx 4.35, which is significantly different from that
of diffuse interstellar dust (i.e., R_V=3.1), and the total extinction to the
star was therefore, on average, A_V \approx 3.1 mag. We find that the observed
spectral energy distribution for the progenitor star is consistent with an
effective temperature of 3600 K (spectral type M3), and that the star therefore
had a bolometric magnitude of -8.29. Through comparison with recent theoretical
massive-star evolutionary tracks we can infer that the red supergiant
progenitor had an initial mass 15 \lesssim M_{ini} (M_sun) < 20. Interpolating
by eye between the available tracks, we surmise that the star had initial mass
~17-18 M_sun. The circumstellar dust around the progenitor must have been
destroyed in the explosion, as the visual extinction to the SN is found to be
low (A_V=0.24 mag with R_V=3.1).

commonly found in the brain and useful for a variety of spike-based
computations such as input filtering and associative memory. A natural
consequence of STDP is establishment of causality in the sense that a neuron
learns to fire with a lag after specific presynaptic neurons have fired. The
effect of STDP on synchrony is elusive because spike synchrony implies unitary
spike events of different neurons rather than a causal delayed relationship
between neurons. We explore how synchrony can be facilitated by STDP in
oscillator networks with a pacemaker. We show that STDP with asymmetric
learning windows leads to self-organization of feedforward networks starting
from the pacemaker. As a result, STDP drastically facilitates frequency
synchrony. Even though differences in spike times are lessened as a result of
synaptic plasticity, the finite time lag remains so that perfect spike
synchrony is not realized. In contrast to traditional mechanisms of large-scale
synchrony based on mutual interaction of coupled neurons, the route to
synchrony discovered here is enslavement of downstream neurons by upstream
ones. Facilitation of such feedforward synchrony does not occur for STDP with
symmetric learning windows.

hole concentration, to investigate the magnetic state induced by the Fe
substitution recently suggested from the neutron-scattering measurements [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 107, 127002 (2011)]. It has been found that the magnetic transition
temperature is notably enhanced through the 1% Fe substitution in a wide range
of hole concentration where superconductivity appears in Fe-free La2-xSrxCuO4.
In the underdoped regime, the Fe-induced magnetic order can be understood in
terms of the concept of stripe pinning by Fe as in the case of the Zn-induced
one in La2-xSrxCu1-yZnyO4. In the overdoped regime, on the other hand, the
Fe-induced magnetic order is short-ranged, which is distinct from the stripes.

theoretically for the lower and higher excitation cases, respectively. The
dressed states containing the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) are obtained by
transforming the two-atom system into an effective single-atom one. We found
that the DDI can enhance the effects resulting from the positive atom-cavity
detunings but weaken them for the negative detunings cases for lower
excitation, which can promote the spectrum exhibiting two asymmetric peaks and
shift the heights and the positions of them. For the higher excitation cases,
DDI can augment the atomic saturation and lead to the deforming of the

linear measurements. Motivated by the need to monitor large-scale networks from
a limited number of measurements, this paper addresses the problem of
recovering sparse signals in the presence of network topological constraints.
Unlike conventional sparse recovery where a measurement can contain any subset
of the unknown variables, we use a graph to characterize the topological
constraints and allow an additive measurement over nodes (unknown variables)
only if they induce a connected subgraph. We provide explicit measurement
constructions for several special graphs, and the number of measurements by our
construction is less than that needed by existing random constructions.
Moreover, our construction for a line network is provably optimal in the sense
that it requires the minimum number of measurements. A measurement construction
algorithm for general graphs is also proposed and evaluated. For any given
graph $G$ with $n$ nodes, we derive bounds of the minimum number of
measurements needed to recover any $k$-sparse vector over $G$ ($M^G_{k,n}$).
Using the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph as an example, we characterize the

take into account physical processes such as unstable disk accretion, radio
ejection, bump-induced detachment, and outflow from the $L_{2}$ point.
Comparing the calculated results with the observations of binary radio pulsars,
we report the following results. (1) The allowed parameter space for forming
binary pulsars in the initial orbital period - donor mass plane increases with
increasing neutron star mass. This may help explain why some MSPs with orbital
periods longer than $\sim 60$ days seem to have less massive white dwarfs than
expected. Alternatively, some of these wide binary pulsars may be formed
through mass transfer driven by planet/brown dwarf-involved common envelope
evolution. (2) Some of the pulsars in compact binaries might have evolved from
intermediate-mass X-ray binaries with anomalous magnetic braking. (3) The
equilibrium spin periods of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries are in
general shorter than the observed spin periods of binary pulsars by more than
one order of magnitude, suggesting that either the simple equilibrium spin
model does not apply, or there are other mechanisms/processes spinning down the
neutron stars.

known as phyllotaxis. A constant angle between two successive leaves is called
divergence angle. On the one side, the divergence angle $\alpha_0$ of an
initial pattern of leaf primordia at a shoot apex is most commonly an
irrational number of about 137.5 degrees, called limit divergence. On the other
side, the divergence $\alpha$ of a final pattern of leaf traces in the vascular
system of a mature stem is expressed in terms of a sequence of rational
numbers, 1/2, 1/3, 2/5, 3/8, 5/13, 8/21, called phyllotactic fractions. The
mathematical relationship between the initial divergence $\alpha_0$, the final
divergence $\alpha$, and the number of internodes traversed by the leaf traces
$n_c$ is investigated by means of a theoretical model of vascular phyllotaxis.
It is shown that continuous changes of the trace length $n_c$ induce
transitions between the fractional orders in the vascular structure. The
vascular phyllotaxis transition suggests an evolutionary mechanism for the
phenomenon of phyllotaxis. To provide supporting evidence for the model and
mechanism, available experimental results for fossil remains of Lepidodendron
and the vascular structure of Linum and Populus are analyzed with the model.

noise is also suppressed under such spin-damping, with a characteristic

photon-shot, and spin-projection noise can be measured distinctly. While the
suppression of resonant photon-shot noise implies the closed-loop production of

does not imply spin-squeezing, rather simply the broadening of the noise
spectrum with Q. Furthermore, the application of spin-damping during

result by Abakumov-Liaw-Poltoratski which is rooted in the study of spectral
behavior under rank-one perturbations, and states that every non-zero vector is

ancillary cost to suppliers. Furthermore, in the near future, deep penetration
of volatile renewable electricity generation is expected to exacerbate the
variability of demand on conventional thermal generating units. We address this
issue by explicitly modeling the ancillary cost associated with demand
variability. We argue that a time-varying price equal to the suppliers'
instantaneous marginal cost may not achieve social optimality, and that
consumer demand fluctuations should be properly priced. We propose a dynamic
pricing mechanism that explicitly encourages consumers to adapt their
consumption so as to offset the variability of demand on conventional units.
Through a dynamic game-theoretic formulation, we show that (under suitable
convexity assumptions) the proposed pricing mechanism achieves social
optimality asymptotically, as the number of consumers increases to infinity.
Numerical results demonstrate that compared with marginal cost pricing, the
proposed mechanism creates a stronger incentive for consumers to shift their
peak load, and therefore has the potential to reduce the need for long-term
investment in peaking plants.

an extended study conducted using custom-grown, matched modulation-doped n-type

to the inherent `leakiness' of gates on p-type heterostructures, as commonly

trapping and charge migration in the doping layer. Our results provide insights
into the physics of Si acceptors in AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructures, including

mitigating the gate hysteresis, including poisoning the modulation-doping layer
with deep-trapping centers (e.g., by co-doping with transition metal species),
and replacing the Schottky gates with degenerately-doped semiconductor gates to
screen the conducting channel from GaAs surface-states.

simulates the evolution of the coronal-wave phenomenon associated with the
event. From EUV observations, the wave signature appears to be dome shaped
having a component propagating on the solar surface (v~280 km s-1) as well as
off-disk (v~600 km s-1) away from the Sun. The off-disk dome of the wave
consists of two enhancements in intensity, which conjointly develop and can be
followed up to white-light coronagraph images. Applying an analytic model, we
derive that these intensity variations belong to a wave-driver system with a
weakly shocked wave, initially driven by expanding loops, which are indicative
of the early evolution phase of the accompanying CME. We obtain the shock
standoff distance between wave and driver from observations as well as from
model results. The shock standoff distance close to the Sun (<0.3 Rs above the
solar surface) is found to rapidly increase with values of ~0.03-0.09 Rs which
give evidence of an initial lateral (over-)expansion of the CME. The
kinematical evolution of the on-disk wave could be modeled using input
parameters which require a more impulsive driver (t=90 s, a=1.7 km s-2)

computing environments, since large amount of data intensive applications
frequently involve a high degree of data access locality. Grid applications
typically deal with large amounts of data. In traditional approaches
high-performance computing consists dedicated servers that are used to data
storage and data replication. In this paper we present a new mechanism for
distributed and big data storage and resource discovery services. Here we
proposed an architecture named Dynamic and Scalable Storage Management (DSSM)
architecture in grid environments. This allows in grid computing not only
sharing the computational cycles, but also share the storage space. The storage
can be transparently accessed from any grid machine, allowing easy data sharing
among grid users and applications. The concept of virtual ids that, allows the
creation of virtual spaces has been introduced and used. The DSSM divides all
Grid Oriented Storage devices (nodes) into multiple geographically distributed
domains and to facilitate the locality and simplify the intra-domain storage
management. Grid service based storage resources are adopted to stack simple
modular service piece by piece as demand grows. To this end, we propose four
axes that define: DSSM architecture and algorithms description, Storage
resources and resource discovery into Grid service, Evaluate purpose prototype
system, dynamically, scalability, and bandwidth, and Discuss results.

orientation and strain fields in polycrystals, with a submicron spatial
resolution in two dimensions. In the well crystallized parts of the grains, the
analysis of Laue spot positions provides the local deviatoric strain tensor.
The hydrostatic part of the strain tensor may also be obtained, at the cost of
a longer measuring time, by measuring the energy profiles of the Laue spots
using a variable-energy monochromatic beam. A new ""Rainbow"" method is
presented, which allows measuring the energy profiles of the Laue spots while
remaining in the white-beam mode. It offers mostly the same information as the
latter monochromatic method, but with two advantages : i) the simultaneous
measurement of the energy profiles and the Laue pattern; ii) the rapid access
to energy profiles of a larger number of spots, for equivalent scans on the
angle of the optical element. The method proceeds in the opposite way compared
to a monochromator-based method, by simultaneously removing several sharp
energy bands from the incident beam, instead of selecting a single one. It uses
a diamond single crystal placed upstream of the sample. Each Laue diffraction
by diamond lattice planes attenuates the corresponding energy in the incident
spectrum. By rotating the crystal, the filtered-out energies can be varied in a
controlled manner, allowing one to determine the extinction energies of several
Laue spots of the studied sample. The energies filtered-out by the diamond
crystal are obtained by measuring its Laue pattern with an other 2D detector,
at each rotation step. This article demonstrates the feasibility of the method,
and its validation through the measurement of a known lattice parameter.

the c-axis ($m//c$) calculated in the GGA+$U$ scheme with $U = 1.6$ eV and $J =

contrast, the $\sigma_{xy}^A$ and $m_o$ from the GGA calculations are
significantly smaller than the measured ones. This suggests that moderate $U =
1.6$ eV and $J = 0.9$ eV are appropriate for Co metals. The calculated AHC and
spin Hall conductivity (SHC) ($\sigma^S$) are highly anisotropic, and the ratio
of the Hall conductivity for $m//c$ to that for the magnetization being
in-plane ($m//ab$) from the GGA+$U$ calculations, is $\sim$16.0 for the AHC and
$\sim$6.0 for the SHC. For $m//c$, the spin-up and spin-down Hall currents are
found to flow in the same direction. The magnitude of the calculated Hall
current spin polarization ($P^H$) is large and $P^H = -0.61$. Remarkably, for
$m//ab$, the spin-up and spin-down Hall currents are predicted to flow in the

critical exponents. These can further be related to the results of previous
finite-size scaling analyses carried out for the system spanning loops. For the

optimization problem that can be solved exactly by using sophisticated matching
algorithms. This allowed us to study here numerically exact very large systems

gained a lot of attraction in wireless networking research community. The
effective capacity is based on G\""artner-Ellis' large deviation theorem and it
is used to provide the statistical QoS provisioning in the wireless networks.
Effective capacity also helps in the analysis of the resource allocation or
scheduling policies in various wireless systems such as Relay networks,
multi-user systems and multi-carrier systems subject to statistical QoS
requirements. The effective capacity in noise limited wireless network has
already been investigated in the recent works. Considering the interference
limited wireless channels, in this paper we propose an analytical approach
based on Laplace's method for the effective capacity of uncorrelated Rayleigh
fading channel in the presence of uncorrelated Rayleigh fading interference.
The accuracy of the analytical model for the effective capacity is validated by
numerical simulations. We also provide the evaluation of tail probability of
the delay and maximum sustainable rate. The validation results reveal that the
proposed mathematical approach to the effective capacity can open the path for
further researches in statistical QoS provisioning in interference limited

nonlinearity, several interesting phenomena arise which are the focuses of this
work. For the energy structure, the bistability appears in the energy levels
due to this atoms-cavity field nonlinearity, and the same phenomena can be
found in the intra-cavity photons number. With an increase of the pump-cavity
detunings, the higher and lower energy levels show a loop structure due to this
cavity-mediated effects. In the dynamical process, an extensive numerical
simulation of localization of the BECs for atoms initially trapped in one-,
two-, and three-wells are performed for the symmetric and asymmetric cases in
detail. It is shown that the the transition from oscillation to the
localization can be modified by the cavity-mediated potential, which will
enlarge the regions of oscillation. With the increasing of the atomic
interaction, the oscillation is blocked and the localization emerges. The
condensates atoms can be trapped either in one-, two-, or in three wells
eventually where they are initially uploaded for certain parameters. In
particular, we find that the transition from the oscillation to the
localization is accompanied with some irregular regime where tunneling dynamics
is dominated by chaos for this cavity-mediated system.

cycle-to-cycle fluctuations in the pulsation period, indicating that classical
Cepheids may not be as accurate astrophysical clocks as commonly believed:
regardless of the specific points used to determine the O-C values, the cycle
lengths show a scatter of 0.015-0.02 days over the 120 cycles covered by the
observations. A very slight correlation between the individual Fourier
parameters and the O-C values was found, suggesting that the O - C variations
might be due to the instability of the light curve shape. Random fluctuation
tests revealed a linear trend up to a cycle difference 15, but for long term,
the period remains around the mean value. We compare the measurements with
simulated light curves that were constructed to mimic V1154 Cyg as a perfect
pulsator modulated only by the light travel time effect caused by low-mass
companions. We show that the observed period jitter in V1154 Cyg represents a
serious limitation in the search for binary companions. While the Kepler data
are accurate enough to allow the detection of planetary bodies in close orbits
around a Cepheid, the astrophysical noise can easily hide the signal of the

on the logit choice function [McFadden, 1974], used for modeling players with
limited rationality and knowledge. In this paper we study the all-logit
dynamics, where at each time step all players concurrently update their
strategies according to the logit choice function. In the well studied
one-logit dynamics [Blume, 1993] instead at each step only one randomly chosen
player is allowed to update.
  We study properties of the all-logit dynamics in the context of local
interaction games, a class of games that has been used to model complex social
phenomena and physical systems. In a local interaction game, players are the
vertices of a social graph whose edges are two-player potential games. Each
player picks one strategy to be played for all the games she is involved in and
the payoff of the player is the sum of the payoffs from each of the games. We
prove that local interaction games characterize the class of games for which
the all-logit dynamics is reversible.
  We then compare the stationary behavior of one-logit and all-logit dynamics.
Specifically, we look at the expected value of a notable class of observables,
that we call decomposable observables. We prove that the difference between the
expected values of the observables at stationarity for the two dynamics depends
only on the rationality level beta and on the distance of the social graph from
a bipartite graph. In particular, if the social graph is bipartite then
decomposable observables have the same expected value. Finally, we show that
the mixing time of the all-logit dynamics has the same twofold behavior that
has been highlighted in the case of the one-logit: for some games it
exponentially depends on the rationality level beta, whereas for other games it
can be upper bounded by a function independent from beta.

interactions are effective to let the system evolve only through second-order
transitions as long as a few minor conditions are satisfied. It is also
discussed whether the overlap of the ground-state wave function of the new
driver term with the target ground state is an essential factor for the
success.

several interesting effects, amongst them quantum state stabilisation and the

the assumption that control operations on the system be affected
instantaneously after the measurement of electronic jumps through it. In this
contribution I describe how to include a delay between detection and control
operation in the master equation theory of feedback-controlled quantum
transport. I investigate the consequences of delay for the state-stabilisation

a mean-field approach and take into account the dynamics within the unit cell
exactly. The system supports Mott-insulating as well as superfluid phases. The
transitions between these phases are second-order for spinless bosons and
second- or first-order for spin-1 bosons. Anti-ferromagnetic interactions
energetically penalize high-spin configurations and elongate all Mott lobes,
especially the ones corresponding to an even atom number on each lattice site.
We find that the quadratic Zeeman effect lifts the degeneracy between different
polar superfluid phases leading to additional metastable phases and first-order

of the unit cell induces a staircase of single-atom tunneling resonances which
surprisingly survives well into the superfluid regime.

non-linearly in the effective action of these extended objects. As a
consequence the form of the action is strongly constrained. A new general
method is described to obtain in a systematic way higher order Lorentz
invariant contributions to this action. We find a simple recipe to promote a
term invariant under the stability subgroup to an expression invariant under
the whole Lorentz group. It is based on the following three steps: in the
saturation of worldsheet (or worldvolume) indices replace the Minkowski metric
with the inverse of the induced metric; in the saturation of indices of the
transverse coordinates describing the position of the extended object replace
the Euclidean metric with a certain new metric; finally replace the field
derivatives of order higher than two with a certain covariant derivative.
Lorentz invariance of the expression modified this way immediately follows. We
find in particular that the leading bulk deviation of the Nambu Goto action in
any space-time dimensions is proportional to the square of scalar curvature.

packing fraction of the mixture, $\eta$, in the region of two-phase
isotropic-nematic coexistence as a function of mean aspect ratio,
polydispersity and fraction of total volume $\gamma$ occupied by the nematic
phase. In our model, platelets are polydisperse in the square section, of side
length $\sigma$, but have constant thickness $L$ (and aspect ratio
$\kappa\equiv L/<\sigma><1$, with $<\sigma>$ the mean side length). Good
agreement between our theory and recent experiments is obtained by mapping the
real system onto an effective one, with excluded volume interactions but with
thicker particles (due to the presence of long-ranged repulsive interactions
between platelets). The effect of polydispersity in both shape and particle
size has been taken into account by using a size distribution function with an
effective mean-square deviation that depends on both polydispersities. We also
show that the bimodality of the size distribution function is required to
correctly describe the huge two-phase coexistence gap and the nonlinearity of
the function $\gamma(\eta)$, two important features that these colloidal

model. Throughout the review, we discuss the experimental relevance of these
theories for describing bacterial swarms and suspensions, the cytoskeleton of
living cells, and vibrated granular materials. We suggest promising extensions
towards greater realism in specific contexts from cell biology to ethology, and
remark on some exotic active-matter analogues. Lastly, we summarize the outlook
for a quantitative understanding of active matter, through the interplay of
detailed theory with controlled experiments on simplified systems, with living

In addition to the continuous coverage by Fermi, contemporaneous observations
were carried out from the radio to {\gamma} -ray bands between 2008 September
and 2009 February. In this paper, we summarize the rich multi-wavelength data
collected during the campaign (including F-GAMMA, GASP- WEBT, Kanata, OVRO,
RXTE, SMARTS, Swift, and other instruments), examine the cross-correlation
between the light curves measured in the different energy bands, and interpret
the resulting spectral energy distributions in the context of well-known blazar
emission models. We find that the {\gamma} -ray activity is well correlated
with a series of near-IR/optical flares, accompanied by an increase in the
optical polarization degree. On the other hand, the X-ray light curve shows a
distinct 20 day high state of unusually soft spectrum, which does not match the
extrapolation of the optical/UV synchrotron spectrum. We tentatively interpret
this feature as the bulk Compton emission by cold electrons contained in the
jet, which requires an accretion disk corona with an effective covering factor
of 19% at a distance of 100 Rg . We model the broadband spectra with a leptonic
model with external radiation dominated by the infrared emission from the dusty
torus.

additional properties. Motivated by recent applications, we require global
function fields with the additional property that their zero class divisor
groups contain at most a small number of $d$-torsion points. We capture this by
the torsion limit, a new asymptotic quantity for global function fields. It
seems that it is even harder to determine values of this new quantity than the
Ihara constant. Nevertheless, some non-trivial lower- and upper bounds are
derived. Apart from this new asymptotic quantity and bounds on it, we also
introduce Riemann-Roch systems of equations. It turns out that this type of
equation system plays an important role in the study of several other problems
in areas such as coding theory, arithmetic secret sharing and multiplication
complexity of finite fields etc. Finally, we show how our new asymptotic

Without the lattice, due to the translational invariance and the mass term,
there is a delta function peak at zero frequency on the AC conductivity. We
study how this delta function peak is influenced by the lattice effects, which
we introduce perturbatively. In the probe limit, we evaluate the perturbative
corrections to the conductivities at very small frequency limit. We find that
the delta function peak remains, even after the lattice effects are introduced,

empirical studies, it has been found that gaps between the orders in the order

agent based model to study this issue and, in particular, how the gaps in the
order book emerge. The trading mechanism in our model is based on a
double-auction order book, which is used on nearly all stock exchanges. In
situations where the order book is densely occupied with limit orders we do not
observe fat-tailed distributions. As soon as less liquidity is available, a gap
structure forms which leads to return distributions with heavy tails. We show
that return distributions with heavy tails are an order-book effect if the
available liquidity is constrained. This is largely independent of the specific

are subject to the time-step constraint imposed by the Courant condition. When
the bulk orbital velocity largely exceeds any other wave speed the time step is
considerably reduced and a large number of steps may be necessary to complete
the computation.
  We present a robust numerical scheme to overcome the Courant limitation by
extending the algorithm previously known as FARGO (Fast Advection in Rotating
Gaseous Objects) to the equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The proposed
scheme conserves total angular momentum and energy to machine precision and
works in Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates. The algorithm is
implemented in the PLUTO code for astrophysical gasdynamics and is suitable for
local or global simulations of accretion or proto-planetary disk models.
  By decomposing the total velocity into an average azimuthal contribution and
a residual term, the algorithm solves the MHD equations through a linear
transport step in the orbital direction and a standard nonlinear solver applied
to the MHD equations written in terms of the residual velocity. Since the
former step is not subject to any stability restriction, the Courant condition
is computed only in terms of the residual velocity, leading to substantially
larger time steps. The magnetic field is advanced in time using the constrained
transport method in order to preserve the divergence-free condition.
Conservation of total energy and angular momentum is enforced at the discrete
level by properly expressing the source terms in terms of upwind fluxes
available during the standard solver.
  Our results show that applications of the proposed orbital-advection scheme
to problems of astrophysical relevance provides, at reduced numerical cost,
equally accurate and less dissipative results than standard time-marching
schemes.

of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a
third parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise
ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image
analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the
performance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight
stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that
employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on
the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one,
while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power.
Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum,
we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis
testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and

a D-shaped area next to the core of the ensuing PSF. To make the APP more
efficient for high-contrast imaging, its bandwidth should be as large as
possible, and the location of the D-shaped area should be easily swapped to the
other side of the PSF. We present the design of a broadband APP that yields two
PSFs that have the opposite sides cleared out. Both properties are enabled by a
half-wave liquid crystal layer, for which the local fast axis orientation over
the pupil is forced to follow the required phase structure. For each of the two
circular polarization states, the required phase apodization is thus obtained,
and, moreover, the PSFs after a quarter-wave plate and a polarizing
beam-splitter are complementary due to the antisymmetric nature of the phase
apodization. The device can be achromatized in the same way as half-wave plates
of the Pancharatnam type or by layering self-aligning twisted liquid crystals
to form a monolithic film called a multi-twist retarder. As the VAPP introduces
a known phase diversity between the two PSFs, they may be used directly for
wavefront sensing. By applying an additional quarter-wave plate in front, the
device also acts as a regular polarizing beam-splitter, which therefore
furnishes high-contrast polarimetric imaging. If the PSF core is not saturated,
the polarimetric dual-beam correction can also be applied to polarized
circumstellar structure. The prototype results show the viability of the
vector-APP concept.

increases with time as a power law of the local current amplitude. When a
resistor reaches its fatigue threshold, it burns irreversibly. Over time, this
drives cracks to grow until the system is fractured in two parts. We study the
relation between the macroscopic exponent of the crack growth rate -- entering
the phenomenological Paris law -- and the microscopic damage-accumulation
exponent, $\gamma$, under the influence of disorder. The way the jumps of the
growing crack, $\Delta a$, and the waiting-time between successive breaks,
$\Delta t$, depend on the type of material, via $\gamma$, are also
investigated. We find that the averages of these quantities, $<\Delta a>$ and
$<\Delta t>/<t_r>$, scale as power laws of the crack length $a$, $<\Delta a>
\propto a^{\alpha}$ and $<\Delta t>/<t_r> \propto a^{-\beta}$, where $<t_r>$ is
the average rupture time. Strikingly, our results show, for small values of
$\gamma$, a decrease in the exponent of the Paris law in comparison with the
homogeneous case, leading to an increase in the lifetime of breaking materials.
For the particular case of $\gamma=0$, when fatigue is exclusively ruled by
disorder, an analytical treatment confirms the results obtained by simulation.

general to be a non-well-founded set. Skands of finite lengths are ordinary

  Self-similar skands are also considered, and they clarify the reflexivity of
sets, i.e., the meaning of the relation X is a member of X; in particular,
self-similar skands considered as non-well-founded sets are always reflexive,
but not vice versa. The existence of self-similar skands shows at once that
Russell's well-known paradox is not a paradox at all. The inconsistency of
Russell's ""set"" R, which is the collection of all sets that are not members of
themselves, is proved here not with the help of Russell's paradox (as it is

maximality (universality) of R which goes back to Cantor and can be also

one-dimensional continua of arbitrary powers and the construction of
generalized real numbers as a non-Archimedean straight line of arbitrary power,
and the introduction of the absolute continuum and the absolute straight line

the MS characteristics are governed mainly by the packing procedure, while
effects of friction and initial states can be scaled away. Yet, mechanical
constraints limit slightly occurrence of small Q volumes in large cells, which
does depend on friction. We quantify this deviation from exact collapse for

Routers in a domain forward IP packet within and between domains. Each domain
uses an intra-domain routing protocol known as Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)
like IS-IS, OSPF, RIP etc to populate the routing tables of its routers.
Routing information must also be exchanged between domains to ensure that a
host in one domain can reach another host in remote domain. This role is
performed by inter-domain routing protocol called Exterior Gateway Protocol
(EGP). Basically EGP used these days is Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Basic
difference between the both is that BGP has smaller convergence as compared to
the IGP's. And IGP's on the other hand have lesser scalability as compared to
the BGP. So in this paper a proposal to create a new protocol is given which
can act as an IGP when we consider inter-domain transfer of traffic and acts as
BGP when we consider intra-domain transfer of traffic.

detectable in single-pulse searches. The Lorimer burst is a highly dispersed
isolated radio burst with properties suggestive of extragalactic origin.
Perytons share the frequency-swept nature of the Rotating Radio Transients and
Lorimer burst, but unlike these events appear in all thirteen beams of the
Parkes Multibeam receiver and are probably a form of peculiar radio frequency
interference. In order to constrain these and other radio source populations
further, we searched the archival Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey data for
events similar to any of these. We did not find any new Rotating Radio
Transients or bursts like the Lorimer burst. We did, however, discover four
peryton-like events. Similar to the perytons, these four bursts are highly
dispersed, detected in all thirteen beams of the Parkes multibeam receiver, and
have pulse widths between 20--30 ms. Unlike perytons, these bursts are not
associated with atmospheric events like rain or lightning. These facts may
indicate that lightning was not responsible for the peryton phenomenon.
Moreover, the lack of highly dispersed celestial signals is the evidence that
the Lorimer burst is unlikely to belong to a cosmological source population.

the graphene landscape using atomic force microscopy, we found that wrinkles
reach a certain maximum height before folding over. Calculations of the
energetics explain the morphological transition, and indicate that the tall
ripples are collapsed into narrow standing wrinkles by van der Waals forces,
analogous to large-diameter nanotubes. Quantum transport calculations show that
conductance through these collapsed wrinkle structures is limited mainly by a
density-of-states bottleneck and by interlayer tunneling across the collapsed
bilayer region. Also through systematic measurements across large numbers of

properties of the adsorbed films as long as the total density is not close to
the monolayer completion. On the other hand, close to the monolayer completion,
the promotion of particles to the second layer considerably affects the
properties of mixed films. It has been shown that the mixture exhibits complete
mixing in the liquid phase and freezes into solid phases of the structure
depending upon the film composition. For submonolayer densities, the melting
temperature exhibits non-monotonous changes with the film composition. In
particular, the melting temperature initially increases when the xenon
concentration increases up to about 20%, then it decreases and reaches minimum
for the xenon concentration of about 40%. For still higher xenon
concentrations, the melting point gradually increases to the temperature
corresponding to pure xenon film. It has been also demonstrated that the
topology of phase diagrams of mixed films is sensitive to the composition of
adsorbed layers.

the distance to the surface of last scattering. If one imposes a quintessence
prior on the dark energy (-1 \leq w(z) \leq 1) then just the WMAP7 and

dispersed visibility data are analyzed by fitting a circular fully
limb-darkened disk (FDD). Results. The FDD diameter as function of wavelength
is similar for all oxygen-rich stars. The apparent size is almost constant
between 8 and 10 micron and gradually increases at wavelengths longer than 10
micron. The apparent FDD diameter in the carbon-rich star V Hya essentially
decreases from 8 to 12 micron. The FDD diameters are about 2.2 times larger
than the photospheric diameters estimated from K-band observations found in the
literature. The silicate dust shells of R Aql, R Hya and W Hya are located
fairly far away from the star, while the silicate dust shell of R Aqr and the
amorphous carbon (AMC) and SiC dust shell of V Hya are found to be closer to
the star at around 8 photospheric radii. Phase-to-phase variations of the
diameters of the oxygen-rich stars could be measured and are on the order of
15% but with large uncertainties. From a comparison of the diameter trend with
the trends in RR Sco and S Ori it can be concluded that in oxygen-rich stars
the overall larger diameter originates from a warm molecular layer of H2O, and
the gradual increase longward of 10 micron can be most likely attributed to the
contribution of a close Al2O3 dust shell. The chromatic trend of the Gaussian
FWHM in V Hya can be explained with the presence of AMC and SiC dust. The
observations suggest that the formation of amorphous Al2O3 in oxygen- rich
stars occurs mainly around or after visual minimum. However, no firm
conclusions can be drawn concerning the mass-loss mechanism.
