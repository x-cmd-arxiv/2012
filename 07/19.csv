evidence, that deeper representations, when well trained, tend to do a better
job at disentangling the underlying factors of variation. We study the
following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better
disentangling, can be exploited to produce faster-mixing Markov chains.
Consequently, mixing would be more efficient at higher levels of
representation. To better understand why and how this is happening, we propose
a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space
they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at
higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them
experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing and
interpolating between samples.

we study one-loop corrections contributed by a massive fermion to primordial

contains logarithms and thus may constrain the validity of perturbation theory

fermion's mass is taken into account. Another one-loop diagram for a massive
fermion which involves one vertex is constrained by a UV cutoff as expected by
quantum field theory. Our result shows that loop corrections of a fermion field

  First, a Clifford algebra bundle over the loop space is constructed from the

continuously over each point of the loop space a polarization class of
Lagrangian subspaces of the complexification of the real vector space from
which the Clifford algebra is made. Being unable to choose a Lagrangian

constructs a bundle gerbe over the loop space of the base manifold to encode
over each loop all such subspaces, along with the isomorphisms between the Fock

across this range whereby the plasma may transition from a low flow gradient
and temperature gradient state to a higher flow gradient and temperature gra-
dient state. We show further that the maximum temperature gradient that can be
reached by such a transition is limited by the existence, at high flow
gradient, of subcritical turbulence driven by the parallel velocity gradient
(PVG). We use linear simulations and analytic calculations to examine the
properties of the transiently growing modes which give rise to this subcritical
turbulence, and conclude that there may be a critical value of the ratio of the
PVG to the suppressing perpendicular gradient of the velocity (in a tokamak
this ratio is equal to q/{\epsilon} where q is the magnetic safety factor and
{\epsilon} the inverse aspect ratio) below which the PVG is unable to drive
subcritical turbulence. In light of this, we use nonlinear simulations to
calculate, as a function of three parameters (the perpendicular flow shear,
q/{\epsilon} and the temperature gradient), the surface within that parameter
space which divides the regions where turbulence can and cannot be sustained:
the zero- turbulence manifold. We are unable to conclude that there is in fact
a critical value of q/{\epsilon} below which PVG-driven turbulence is
eliminated. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that at low values of q/{\epsilon},
the maximum critical temperature gradient that can be reached without

forward a discrete ensemble (or set) of initial states. Data assimilation
techniques tend to focus on estimating the true state of the system, even
though model error limits the value of such efforts. This paper argues for
choosing the initial ensemble in order to optimise forecasting performance
rather than estimate the true state of the system. Density forecasting and
choosing the initial ensemble are treated as one problem. Forecasting
performance can be quantified by some scoring rule. In the case of the
logarithmic scoring rule, theoretical arguments and empirical results are
presented. It turns out that, if the underlying noise dominates model error, we
can diagnose the noise spread.

primordial gas remaining from the protoplanetary disk phase. Tracing the origin
of observed atomic gas in Keplerian rotation in the edge-on debris disk
surrounding the ~12 Myr old star {\beta} Pictoris requires more detailed
information about its spatial distribution than has previously been acquired by
limited slit spectroscopy. Especially indications of asymmetries and presence
of Ca II gas at high disk latitudes call for additional investigation. We set
out to recover a complete image of the Fe I and Ca II gas emission around
{\beta} Pic by spatially resolved, high-resolution spectroscopic observations
to better understand the morphology and origin of the gaseous disk component.
The multiple fiber facility FLAMES/GIRAFFE at the VLT, with the large IFU
ARGUS, was used to obtain spatially resolved optical spectra in four regions
covering the northeast and southwest side of the disk. Emission lines from Fe I
and Ca II were mapped and could be used to fit a parametric function for the
disk gas distribution, using a gas-ionisation code for gas-poor debris disks.
Both Fe I and Ca II emission are clearly detected, with the former dominating
along the disk midplane, and the latter revealing vertically more extended gas.
The surface intensity of the Fe I emission is lower but more extended in the
northeast (reaching the 210 AU limit of our observations) than in the
southwest, while Ca II shows the opposite asymmetry. The modelled Fe gas disk
profile shows a linear increase in scale height with radius, and a vertical
profile that suggests dynamical interaction with the dust. We also
qualitatively demonstrate that the Ca II emission profile can be explained by
optical thickness in the disk midplane, and does not require Ca to be spatially
separated from Fe. [ABRIDGED]

regions of resonant neutralino annihilation still allow for a band at light

current limits of direct searches and, if the neutralino mass was found outside
the resonance regions, a negative \mu-term would be favored from a fine-tuning

the analysis of the baryon content (gas and star) of clusters in the MUSIC
dataset both as a function of aperture radius and redshift. The results from
our simulations are compared with the most recent observational estimates of
the gas fraction in galaxy clusters at different overdensity radii. When the
effects of cooling and stellar feedbacks are included, the MUSIC clusters show
a good agreement with the most recent observed gas fractions quoted in the
literature. A clear dependence of the gas fractions with the total cluster mass
is also evident. The impact of the aperture radius choice, when comparing
integrated quantities at different redshifts, is tested: the standard
definition of radius at a fixed overdensity with respect to critical density is
compared with a definition based on the redshift dependent overdensity with
respect to background density. We also present a detailed analysis of the

consistency of locally polynomial M-estimators that consist of a contrast and a
kernel. Afterwards, minimax results are established over unidimensional
H\""older spaces for degenerate design. We then choose the contrast and the
kernel that minimize an empirical variance term and demonstrate that the
corresponding M-estimator is adaptive with respect to the noise and design
distributions and adaptive (Huber) minimax for contamination models. In a
second step, we additionally choose a data-driven bandwidth via Lepski's
method. This leads to an M-estimator that is adaptive with respect to the noise
and design distributions and, additionally, adaptive with respect to the
smoothness of an isotropic, multivariate, locally polynomial target function.
These results are also extended to anisotropic, locally constant target
functions. Our data-driven approach provides, in particular, a level of
robustness that adapts to the noise, contamination, and outliers.

based on three-layer architecture allowing node to decide distributively what
local information to communicate, and what metaheuristic to apply while the
optimization process is in progress. The adaptive features of DAMS are first
addressed in a very general setting. A specific DAMS called SBM is then
described and analyzed from both a parallel and an adaptive point of view. SBM
is a simple, yet efficient, adaptive distributed algorithm using an
exploitation component allowing nodes to select the metaheuristic with the best
locally observed performance, and an exploration component allowing nodes to
detect the metaheuristic with the actual best performance. The efficiency of
BSM-DAMS is demonstrated through experimentations and comparisons with other
adaptive strategies (sequential and distributed).

non-linearly under GL(n,C), but linearly under its notable subgroups, the
little group and the permutation group S_n. Using GL(n,C) covariant variables,
we present a new and simple formula for the MHV amplitude which can be derived
solely from geometric constraints. This expression carries a huge intrinsic
redundancy which can be parameterized by a pair of reference 3-planes in
n-space. Fixing this redundancy in a particular way, we reproduce the S_{n-3}
symmetric form of the MHV amplitude of [1], which is in turn equivalent to the
S_{n-2} symmetric form of [2] as a consequence of the matrix tree theorem. The
redundancy of the amplitude can also be fixed in a way that fully preserves
S_n, yielding new and manifestly S_n symmetric forms of the MHV amplitude.
Remarkably, these expressions need not be manifestly homogenous in spinorial
weight or mass dimension. We comment on possible extensions to N^{k-2}MHV

well as features associated with bulk density of states, we show that the
buckling creates a periodic potential modulation, which in turn modulates the
surface and the bulk states. The strong correlation between the topographic
ripples and electronic structure indicates that while doping alone is
insufficient to create predetermined potential landscapes, creating ripples
provides a path to controlling the potential seen by the Dirac electrons on a
local scale. Such rippled features may be engineered by strain in thin films
and may find use in future applications of topological insulators.

semi-Fano type studied in arXiv:1206.2277.
  (iv) We obtain much more precise topological information about twisted
connected sum G_2-manifolds; one application is the determination for the first

  (v) We describe ""geometric transitions"" between G_2-metrics on different

  (vi) We construct many G_2-manifolds that contain rigid compact associative

  (vii) We prove that many smooth 2-connected 7-manifolds can be realised as
twisted connected sums in numerous ways; by varying the building blocks matched

In the most simple description of a soccer match one assumes that scoring goals
can be described by a constant goal rate for each team, implying simple
Poissonian and Markovian behavior. Here a general framework for the
identification of deviations from this behavior is presented. For this endeavor
it is essential to formulate an a priori estimate of the expected number of
goals per team in a specific match. The analysis scheme is applied to
approximately 40 seasons of the German Bundesliga. It is possible to

robust if a uniform halo response to baryons is adopted across the sample. The
overall normalization of \dimf, and the detailed DM profile, are less certain,
but the data are consistent with standard cold-DM halos, and a central DM
fraction that is roughly constant with \sigs. For a variety of related studies
in the literature, using SPS, dynamics, and gravitational lensing, similar
results are found. Studies based solely on spectroscopic line diagnostics agree
on a Salpeter-like IMF at high \sigs, but differ at low \sigs. Overall, we find
that multiple independent lines of evidence appear to be converging on a
systematic variation in the IMF, such that high-\sigs\ ETGs have an excess of
low-mass stars relative to spirals and low-\sigs\ ETGs. Robust verification of
super-Salpeter IMFs in the highest-\sigs\ galaxies will require additional
scrutiny of scatter and systematic uncertainties. The implications for the

parameter that affects massive structures. In numerical simulations higher spin
haloes are more strongly clustered than lower spin haloes of equal mass. We
detect a difference of over a 30 per cent in the clustering strength for dark
matter haloes of 10^13-10^14 Msun, which is similar to the result of Bett et
al. We explore whether the dependence of clustering strength on halo spin is
removed if we apply the redefinition of overdensity peak height proposed by
Lacerna & Padilla (Paper I) obtained using assembly ages. We find that this is
not the case due to two reasons. Firstly, only a few objects of low-virial mass
are moved into the mass range where the spin introduces an assembly bias after
using this redefinition. Secondly, this formalism does not alter the mass of
massive objects. We then repeat the process of finding the redefined peak
height of Paper I but using the spin. In this case, the new masses show no
spin-related assembly bias but they introduce a previously absent assembly bias
with respect to relative age. From this result, we conclude that the
assembly-type bias with respect to the halo spin has a different origin than
with respect to assembly age. The former may be due to the material from
filaments, which is accreted by massive haloes, that is enhanced in
high-density environments, thus causing more extreme spin values without
significantly changing the formation age of the halo. In addition, high-mass
objects may correspond, in some cases, to a different peak height than that
suggested by their mass in numerical simulations, providing a possible
explanation for the assembly bias with respect to spin. (abridged)

true mass distribution, the method makes it possible to recover the observed
distribution. We compare our prediction with available radial-velocity data.
Assuming the true mass function is described by a power-law, the minimum mass
function that we recover proves a good fit to the observed distribution at both
mass ends. In particular, it provides an alternative explanation for the
observed low-mass decline, usually explained as sample incompleteness. In
addition, the peak observed near the the low-mass end arises naturally in the
predicted distribution as a consequence of imposing a low-mass cutoff in the
true-distribution. If the low-mass bins below 0.02 M_J are complete, then the
mass distribution in this regime is heavily affected by the small fraction of
lowly inclined interlopers that are actually more massive companions. Finally,
we also present evidence that the exoplanet mass distribution changes form
towards low-mass, implying that a single power law may not adequately describe

identifies AGN, predominantly of low luminosity. We find contamination from
stars as well as a very small sample of sources that show no sign of AGN

also study the host galaxies and environments of the AGN in the sample.
Disturbed host morphologies are relatively common. The host galaxies span a
wide range in the level of ongoing star-formation. However, massive star-bursts
are only present in the hosts of the most luminous AGN in the sample. There is
no clear environmental preference for the AGN sample in general but we find
that the most luminous AGN on average avoid dense regions while some
low-luminosity AGN hosted by late-type galaxies are found near the centres of
groups. AGN in our sample have closer nearest neighbours than the general
galaxy population. We find no indications that major mergers are a dominant
triggering process for the moderate to low luminosity AGN in this sample. The
environments and host galaxy properties instead suggest secular processes, in
particular tidal processes at first passage and minor mergers, as likely

variability selection for AGN and gives first hints at possibly triggering

system all bulk higher spin fields transform in the adjoint of the U(M) gauge
group, whose bulk t'Hooft coupling is $\frac{M}{N}$. Analysis of boundary
conditions in Vasiliev theory allows us to determine exact relations between
the parity breaking phase of Vasiliev theory and the coefficients of two and
three point functions in Chern-Simons vector models at large $N$. Our picture
suggests that the supersymmetric Vasiliev theory can be obtained as a limit of
type IIA string theory in AdS$_4\times \mathbb{CP}^3$, and that the non-Abelian
Vasiliev theory at strong bulk 't Hooft coupling smoothly turn into a string
field theory. The fundamental string is a singlet bound state of Vasiliev's
higher spin particles held together by U(M) gauge interactions. This is
illustrated by the thermal partition function of free ABJ theory on a two
sphere at large $M$ and $N$ even in the analytically tractable free limit. In
this system the traces or strings of the low temperature phase break up into
their Vasiliev particulate constituents at a U(M) deconfinement phase

gravitationally lensed galaxies at z=2.0-2.4 based on adaptive optics-assisted
imaging spectroscopy with the Keck II telescope. Through deep exposures we have
secured high signal to noise data for four galaxies with well-understood
kinematic properties. Three galaxies with well-ordered rotation reveal
metallicity gradients in the sense of having lower gas-phase metallicities at
larger galactocentric radii. Two of these display gradients much steeper than
found locally, while a third has one similar to that seen in local disk
galaxies. The fourth galaxy exhibits complex kinematics indicative of an
ongoing merger and reveals an ""inverted"" gradient with lower metallicity in the
central regions. By comparing our sample to similar data in the literature for
lower redshift galaxies, we determine that, on average, metallicity gradients
must flatten by a factor of 2.6 +/- 0.9 between z=2.2 and the present epoch.
This factor is in rough agreement with the size growth of massive galaxies
suggesting that inside-out growth can account for the evolution of metallicity
gradients. Since the addition of our new data provides the first indication of
a coherent picture of this evolution, we develop a simple model of chemical
evolution to explain the collective data. We find that metallicity gradients
and their evolution can be explained by the inward radial migration of gas
together with a radial variation in the mass loading factor governing the ratio
of outflowing gas to the local star formation rate. Average mass loading
factors of \lsim 2 are inferred from our model in good agreement with direct
measurements of outflowing gas in z \simeq 2 galaxies.

colored scalars. While our results apply to an arbitrary set of colored
scalars, we illustrate the effects with a real color octet scalar -- a simple,
experimentally viable model involving a light (~125-300 GeV) colored scalar.
Given the recent LHC results, we consider two distinct scenarios: First, if the
Higgs is indeed near 125 GeV, we show that the di-Higgs cross section could be
up to nearly one thousand times the Standard Model rate for particular octet
couplings and masses. This is potentially observable in \emph{single} Higgs
production modes, such as $pp \to h h \to \gamma\gamma b\bar{b}$ as well as $pp
\to h h \to \tau^+\tau^- b\bar{b}$ where a small fraction of the $\gamma\gamma$
or $\tau^+\tau^-$ events near the putative Higgs invariant mass peak contain
also a $b\bar{b}$ resonance consistent with the Higgs mass. Second, if the
Higgs is not at 125 GeV (and what the LHC has observed is an impostor), we show
that the same parameter region where singly-produced Higgs production can be
suppressed below current LHC limits, for a heavier Higgs mass, also
simultaneously predicts substantially enhanced di-Higgs production. We point
out several characteristic signals of di-Higgs production with a heavier Higgs
boson, such as $pp \to hh \to W^+W^-W^+W^-$, which could use same-sign
dileptons or trileptons plus missing energy to uncover evidence.

inherent to almost any wireless system, this resource allocation problem has
received extensive attention. Yet, most common techniques either adopt
classical power control, in which mobile stations are received with the same
Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio, or use centralized schemes, in which
base stations coordinate their allocations.
  In this work, we suggest a novel scheduling approach in which each base
station, besides allocating the time and frequency according to given
constraints, also manages its uplink power budget such that the aggregate
interference, ""Noise Rise"", caused by its subscribers at the neighboring cells
is bounded. Our suggested scheme is distributed, requiring neither coordination
nor message exchange.
  We rigorously define the allocation problem under noise rise constraints,
give the optimal solution and derive an efficient iterative algorithm to
achieve it. We then discuss a relaxed problem, where the noise rise is
constrained separately for each sub-channel or resource unit. While
sub-optimal, this view renders the scheduling and power allocation problems
separate, yielding an even simpler and more efficient solution, while the
essence of the scheme is kept. Via extensive simulations, we show that the
suggested approach increases overall performance dramatically, with the same
level of fairness and power consumption.

precision spectroscopy. The success of the new generation of multifibre
instruments under construction to investigate fundamental problems in
cosmology, such as the nature of dark energy, requires accurate modellisation
of the fibre system to achieve their signal-to-noise goals. Despite their
simple construction, fibres exhibit unexpected behaviour including
non-conservation of Etendue (Focal Ratio Degradation; FRD) and modal noise.
Furthermore, new fibre geometries (non-circular or tapered) have become
available to improve the scrambling properties that, together with modal noise,
limit the achievable SNR in precision spectroscopy. These issues have often
been addressed by extensive tests on candidate fibres and their terminations
but these are difficult and time-consuming. Modelling by ray-tracing and wave
analysis is possible with commercial software packages but these do not address
the more complex features, in particular FRD. We use a phase-tracking
ray-tracing method to provide a practical description of FRD derived from our
previous experimental work on circular fibres and apply it to non-standard
fibres. This allows the relationship between scrambling and FRD to be
quantified for the first time. We find that scrambling primarily affects the
shape of the near-field pattern but has negligible effect on the barycentre.
FRD helps to homogenise the nearfield pattern but does not make it completely
uniform. Fibres with polygonal cross-section improve scrambling without
amplifying the FRD. Elliptical fibres, in conjunction with tapering, may offer
an efficient means of image slicing to improve the product of resolving power
and throughput but the result is sensitive to the details of illumination.

velocity data set for GJ 581 that was presented by Forveille et al. (2011). Our
analysis reaches substantially different conclusions regarding the evidence for
a Super-Earth-mass planet in the star's Habitable Zone. We were able to
reproduce their reported \chi_{\nu}^2 and RMS values only after removing some
outliers from their models and refitting the trimmed down RV set. A suite of
4000 N-body simulations of their Keplerian model all resulted in unstable
systems and revealed that their reported 3.6\sigma detection of e=0.32 for the
eccentricity of GJ 581e is manifestly incompatible with the system's dynamical
stability. Furthermore, their Keplerian model, when integrated only over the
time baseline of the observations, significantly increases the \chi_{\nu}^2 and
demonstrates the need for including non-Keplerian orbital precession when
modeling this system. We find that a four-planet model with all of the planets
on circular or nearly circular orbits provides both an excellent
self-consistent fit to their RV data and also results in a very stable
configuration. The periodogram of the residuals to a 4-planet
all-circular-orbit model reveals significant peaks that suggest one or more
additional planets in this system. We conclude that the present 240-point HARPS
data set, when analyzed in its entirety, and modeled with fully self-consistent
stable orbits, by and of itself does offer significant support for a fifth
signal in the data with a period near 32 days. This signal has a False Alarm

interpreted as long-lived magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves. The propagation and
amplitude of these waves is affected by local physical characteristics, most
importantly the gas density and the ionization fraction.
  Aims: We study the propagation, reflection and dissipation of Alfv\'en waves
in molecular clouds deriving the behavior of observable quantities such as the
amplitudes of velocity fluctuations and the rate of energy dissipation.
  Methods: We formulated the problem in terms of Els\""asser variables for
transverse MHD waves propagating in a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium,
including the dissipation due to collisions between ions and neutrals and to a
nonlinear turbulent cascade treated in a phenomenological way. We considered
both steady-state and time-dependent situations and solved the equations of the
problem numerically with an iterative method and a Lax-Wendroff scheme,
respectively.
  Results: Alfv\'en waves incident on overdense regions with density profiles
typical of cloud cores embedded in a diffuse gas suffer enhanced reflection in
the regions of the steepest density gradient, and strong dissipation in the
core's interior. These effects are especially significant when the wavelength
is intermediate between the critical wavelength for propagation and the typical
scale of the density gradient. For larger wave amplitudes and/or steeper input
spectra, the effects of the perpendicular turbulent cascade result in a
stronger energy dissipation in the regions immediately surrounding the dense
core.
  Conclusions: The results may help to interpret the sharp decrease of line
width observed in the environments of low-mass cloud cores in several molecular
transitions.

They are a class of large logs which arise for non-global jet-shape observables

Their resummation to all orders is highly non--trivial due to the non-trivial
role of clustering amongst soft gluons which results in the phase-space being
non-factorisable. This may therefore significantly impact the accuracy of
analytical estimations of many of such observables. Nonetheless, in this paper
we address this very issue for jet shapes defined using the $k_t$ and C/A

coefficients of the Abelian $\alpha_s^2 L^2$, $\alpha_s^3 L^3$ and $\alpha_s^4

technology. A PCM cell stores data by using its amorphous and crystalline
states. The cell changes between these two states using high temperature.
However, since the cells are sensitive to high temperature, it is important,
when programming cells, to balance the heat both in time and space.
  In this paper, we study the time-space constraint for PCM, which was
originally proposed by Jiang et al. A code is called an
\emph{$(\alpha,\beta,p)$-constrained code} if for any $\alpha$ consecutive
rewrites and for any segment of $\beta$ contiguous cells, the total rewrite
cost of the $\beta$ cells over those $\alpha$ rewrites is at most $p$. Here,
the cells are binary and the rewrite cost is defined to be the Hamming distance
between the current and next memory states. First, we show a general upper
bound on the achievable rate of these codes which extends the results of Jiang
et al. Then, we generalize their construction for $(\alpha\geq 1,
\beta=1,p=1)$-constrained codes and show another construction for $(\alpha = 1,
\beta\geq 1,p\geq1)$-constrained codes. Finally, we show that these two
constructions can be used to construct codes for all values of $\alpha$,
$\beta$, and $p$.

have been predicted by theories, but no relics of PISNe have been observed yet.
Among the distinct characteristics of the yields of PISN, as predicted by
theoretical calculations, are a strong odd-even effect, and a strong
overabundance of Ca with respect to iron and the Solar ratio. We use the latter
characteristic to identify metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo that have been
pre-enriched by PISN, by comparing metallicites derived from strong, co-added
Fe lines detected in low-resolution (i.e., R \sim 2000) spectra of the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), with metallicities determined by the SDSS Stellar
Parameters Pipeline (SSPP). The latter are based on the strength of the Ca II K
line and assumptions on the Ca/Fe abundance ratio. Stars are selected as
candidates if their metallicity derived from Fe lines is significantly lower
than the SSPP metallicities. In a sample of 12,300 stars for which SDSS
spectroscopy is available, we have identified 18 candidate stars. Higher
resolution and signal-to-noise ratio spectra of these candidates are being
obtained with the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory and
the XSHOOTER spectrograph, to determine their abundance patterns, and to verify
our selection method. We plan to apply our method to the data base of several

non-differentiability of the $\ell_1$-norm causes more challenging especially
in large problems encountered in many practical applications. This paper
proposes, analyzes, and tests a Barzilai-Borwein gradient algorithm. At each
iteration, the generated search direction enjoys descent property and can be
easily derived by minimizing a local approximal quadratic model and
simultaneously taking the favorable structure of the $\ell_1$-norm. Moreover, a
nonmonotone line search technique is incorporated to find a suitable stepsize
along this direction. The algorithm is easily performed, where the values of
the objective function and the gradient of the smooth term are required at
per-iteration. Under some conditions, the proposed algorithm is shown to be
globally convergent. The limited experiments by using some nonconvex
unconstrained problems from CUTEr library with additive $\ell_1$-regularization
illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs quite well. Extensive
experiments for $\ell_1$-regularized least squares problems in compressive

The accuracy of the free energy reaches $10^{-26}$. Basing on these accurate

bulk free energy density is given by $f_{\infty}=0.92969539834161021499(1)$,
comparing with Onsager's exact result $f_{\infty}=0.92969539834161021506...$.

in which the central charge of the Ising model is found to be $c=0.5\pm 1\times

geometry independent, i.e., independent of aspect ratio. The implication of
this finding on the finite scaling is discussed. In the second order correction

Mg-Zn alloy. Despite precipitation strengthening being crucial for the
practical application of magnesium alloys this study represents the first
systematic examination of the effect of controlled deformation on the
precipitate size distribution and the resulting strength and ductility of a
magnesium alloy. Pre-ageing deformation was used to obtain various
distributions of rod-shaped \beta' precipitates through heterogeneous
nucleation. Alloys were extruded to obtain a texture so as to avoid formation
of twins and thus to ensure that dislocations were the primary nucleation site.
Pre-ageing strain refined precipitate length and diameter, with average length
reduced from 440 nm to 60 nm and diameter from 14 nm to 9 nm. Interparticle
spacings were measured from micrographs and indicated some inhomogeneity in the
precipitate distribution. The yield stress of the alloy increased from 273 MPa
to 309 MPa. The yield stress increased linearly as a function of reciprocal
interparticle spacing, but at a lower rate than predicted for Orowan
strengthening. Pre-ageing deformation also resulted in a significant loss of
ductility (from 17% to 6% elongation). Both true strain at failure and uniform
elongation showed a linear relationship with particle spacing, in agreement
with models for the accumulation of dislocations around non-deforming
obstacles. Samples subjected to 3% pre-ageing deformation showed a
substantially increased ageing response compared to non-deformed material;
however, additional deformation (to 5% strain) resulted in only modest changes
in precipitate distribution and mechanical properties.

non-magnetic collapsed tetragonal (cT) phase with diminished c-parameter is
favored for P > 0.36 GPa, in agreement with experiments. Rather than a
mechanical instability, this is an enthalpically driven transition from the
higher volume OR phase to the lower volume cT phase. Calculations of electronic
density of states reveal pseudogaps in both OR and cT phases, though As(p)
hybridization with Fe(d) is more pronounced in the OR phase. We provide an
estimate for the inter-planar magnetic coupling. Phonon entropy considerations
provide an interpretation of the finite temperature phase boundaries of the cT

analysis of colour-magnitude diagrams is much more powerful than luminosity
functions (LFs) in determining the Milky Way structure. We derive a
best-fitting TRILEGAL model to simulate the NGP field in the (g-r, g) CMD of
SDSS filters via Hess diagrams. For the Besancon model, we simulate the LFs and
Hess diagrams in all SDSS filters. We use a chi2 analysis and determine the
median of the relative deviations in the Hess diagrams to quantify the quality
of the fits by the TRILEGAL models and the Besancon model in comparison and
compare this with the Just-Jahreiss model. The input isochrones in the
colour-absolute magnitude diagrams of the thick disc and halo are tested via
the observed fiducial isochrones of globular clusters (GCs). We find that the
default parameter set lacking a thick disc component gives the best
representation of the LF in TRILEGAL. The Hess diagram reveals that a
metal-poor thick disc is needed. In the Hess diagram, the median relative
deviation of the TRILEGAL model and the SDSS data amounts to 25 percent,
whereas for the Just-Jahreiss model the deviation is only 5.6 percent. The
isochrone analysis shows that the representation of the MS of (at least
metal-poor) stellar populations in the SDSS system is reliable. In contrast,
the RGBs fail to match the observed fiducial sequences of GCs. The Besancon
model shows a similar median relative deviation of 26 percent in (g-r, g). In
the u band, the deviations are larger. There are significant offsets between
the isochrone set used in the Besancon model and the observed fiducial
isochrones. In contrast to Hess diagrams, LFs are insensitive to the detailed
structure of the Milky Way components due to the extended spatial distribution
along the line of sight.

than being mandatory. Owing to the perceptions about risks associated with
vaccines and the `herd immunity' effect, it may provide suboptimal vaccination
coverage for the population as a whole. In this case, some subsidy policies may
be offered by the government to promote vaccination coverage. But, not all
subsidy policies are effective in controlling the transmission of infectious
diseases. We address the question of which subsidy policy is best, and how to
appropriately distribute the limited subsidies to maximize vaccine coverage. To
answer these questions, we establish a model based on evolutionary game theory,
where individuals try to maximize their personal payoffs when considering the
voluntary vaccination mechanism. Our model shows that voluntary vaccination
alone is insufficient to control an epidemic. Hence, two subsidy policies are
systematically studied: (1) in the free subsidy policy the total amount of
subsidies is distributed to some individuals and all the donees may vaccinate
at no cost, and (2) in the part-offset subsidy policy each vaccinated person is
offset by a certain proportion of the vaccination cost. Simulations suggest
that, since the part-offset subsidy policy can encourage more individuals to be
vaccinated, the performance of this policy is significantly better than that of
the free subsidy policy.

dark matter (DM) haloes are affected by the baryonic processes associated with
galaxy formation. We focus on how these processes influence the spin and shape
of a large number of DM haloes covering a wide range of mass scales, from
galaxies to clusters at redshifts zero and one, extending to dwarf galaxies at
redshift two. The haloes are extracted from the OverWhelmingly Large
Simulations, a suite of state-of-the-art high-resolution cosmological
simulations run with a range of feedback prescriptions. We find that the median
spin parameter in DM-only simulations is independent of mass, redshift and
cosmology. At z=0 baryons increase the spin of the DM in the central region
(<=0.25 r_200) by up to 30 per cent when feedback is weak or absent. This
increase can be attributed to the transfer of angular momentum from baryons to
the DM, but is no longer present at z=2. We also present fits to the mass
dependence of the DM halo shape at both low and high redshift. At z=0 the
sphericity (triaxiality) is negatively (positively) correlated with halo mass
and both results are independent of cosmology. Interestingly, these
mass-dependent trends are markedly weaker at z=2. While the cooling of baryons
acts to make the overall DM halo more spherical, stronger feedback
prescriptions tend to reduce the impact of baryons by reducing the central halo
mass concentration. More generally, we demonstrate a strongly positive
(negative) correlation between halo sphericity (triaxiality) and galaxy
formation efficiency, with the latter measured using the central halo baryon
fraction. In conclusion, our results suggest that the effects of baryons on the
DM halo spin and shape are minor when the effects of cooling are mitigated, as
required by realistic models of galaxy formation, although they remain
significant for the inner halo.

$k$-core decomposition in a static graph. There exists a linear time algorithm
for $k$-core decomposition in a static graph. However, in many real-world
applications such as online social networks and the Internet, the graph
typically evolves over time. Under such applications, a key issue is to
maintain the core number of nodes given the graph changes over time. A simple
implementation is to perform the linear time algorithm to recompute the core
number for every node after the graph is updated. Such simple implementation is
expensive when the graph is very large. In this paper, we propose a new
efficient algorithm to maintain the core number for every node in a dynamic
graph. Our main result is that only certain nodes need to update their core
number given the graph is changed by inserting/deleting an edge. We devise an
efficient algorithm to identify and recompute the core number of such nodes.
The complexity of our algorithm is independent of the graph size. In addition,
to further accelerate the algorithm, we develop two pruning strategies by
exploiting the lower and upper bounds of the core number. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments over both real-world and synthetic datasets, and the
results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

of some points connected to each other in a hierarchical structure, called
Enquiry Hierarchical (EH). The main operation in pattern enquiry seeking is to
locate the steps that match the given EH in the dataset. A point of algorithms
has offered for EH matching; but the majority of this algorithms seeks all of
the enquiry steps to access all EHs in the dataset. A few algorithms such as
seek only steps that satisfy end points of EH. All of above algorithms are
trying to locate a way just for investigating direct testing of steps and to
locate the answer of enquiry, directly via these points. In this paper, we
describe a novel algorithm to locate the answer of enquiry without access to
real point of the dataset blindly. In this algorithm, first, the enquiry will
be executed on enquiry schema and this leads to a schema. Using this plan, it
will be clear how to seek end steps and how to achieve enquiry dataset, before
seeking of the dataset steps. Therefore, none of dataset steps will be seek
blindly.

with PeV energies observed by IceCube: Ultra-high energy cosmic ray protons (or
Fe nuclei) scatter on CMB photons through the Delta-resonance (the
Berezinsky-Zatsepin process) yielding charged pions and neutrons. The neutron
decays give electron-antineutrinos which undergo neutrino oscillations to
populate all antineutrino flavors, but the electron-antineutrino flux remains
dominant. At 6.3 PeV electron-antineutrino energy their annihilation on
electrons in the IceCube detector is enhanced by the Glashow resonance (the
W-boson) whose decays can give the PeV showers observed in the IceCube
detector. The two observed showers with ~1 PeV energies would need to be from W
leptonic decays to electrons and taus. An order of magnitude higher event rate
of showers at 6.3 PeV is predicted from W to hadron decays. This interpretation
can be tested in the near term. It has significant physics implications on the
origin of the highest energy cosmic rays, since neutrino events and cosmic ray
events likely share a common origin.

featureless dielectric continuum with long-range electrostatic forces that
scale with the statistical variance of their quenched random charge
distribution and inversely with the distance between their bounding surfaces.
By accounting for the whole spectrum of electromagnetic field fluctuations, we
show that this long-range disorder-generated interaction extends well into the
retarded regime where higher-order Matsubara frequencies contribute
significantly. This occurs even for highly clean samples with only a trace
amount of charge disorder and shows that disorder effects can be important down
to the nano scale. As a result, the previously predicted non-monotonic behavior
for the total force between dissimilar slabs as a function of their separation
distance is substantially modified by higher-order contributions, and in almost
all cases of interest, we find that the equilibrium inter-surface separation is
shifted to substantially larger values compared to predictions based solely on
the zero-frequency component. This suggests that the ensuing non-monotonic
interaction is more easily amenable to experimental detection. The presence of
charge disorder in the intervening dielectric medium between the two slabs is
shown to lead to an additional force that can be repulsive or attractive
depending on the system parameters and can, for instance, wash out the
non-monotonic behavior of the total force when the intervening slab contains a
sufficiently large amount of disorder charges.

We show that statistical mechanics of the system can be solved exactly using a
path integral formalism which gives access to the full effect of thermal
fluctuations, going thus beyond the usual Gaussian approximations which take
into account only the contributions from the minimal energy configuration and
small fluctuations about this minimal energy solution. We obtain the free
energy of the wrapping-unwrapping transition of the filament around the
cylinders as well as the effective interaction between two wrapped cylinders
due to thermal fluctuations of the elastic filament. A change of entropy due to
wrapping of the filament around the adsorbing cylinders as they move closer
together is identified as an additional source of interactions between them.
Such entropic wrapping effects should be distinguished from the usual entropic
configuration effects in semi-flexible polymers. Our results may be applicable
to the problem of adsorption of proteins as well as synthetic nano-particles on
semi-flexible polymers such as DNA.

aim of this study was to analyze the effect of the combination of treadmill
walking (imposed speed) and auditory cueing (imposed cadence) on gait dynamics.
Twenty middle-aged subjects performed 6 x 5min walking trials at various
imposed speeds on an instrumented treadmill. Freely-chosen walking cadences
were measured during the first three trials, and then imposed accordingly in
the last three trials by using a metronome. Detrended fluctuation analysis
(DFA) was performed on the times series of ST, SL, and SS. Treadmill induced
anti-persistent dynamics in the time series of SS, but preserved the
persistence of ST and SL. On the contrary, all the three parameters were
anti-persistent under dual-constraints condition. Anti-persistent dynamics may
be related to a tighter control: deviations are followed by a rapid
over-correction, what produces oscillations around target values. Under single
constraint condition, while SS is tightly regulated in order to follow the
treadmill speed, redundancy between ST and SL would likely allow persistent
pattern to occur. Conversely, under dual constraint conditions, the absence of
redundancy among SL, ST and SS would explain the generalized anti-persistent

manifold arms changes considerably with time, as expected from the changes in
the bar strength and pattern speed. In particular, the radial extent of the
arms increases with time, thus bringing about a considerable increase of the
disc size, by as much as ~50% in about a Gyr.

applications such as smart grids or intelligent transportation systems, where
users continuously send data to third-party aggregators performing global
monitoring or control tasks, and require guarantees that this data cannot be
used to infer additional personal information. To provide strong formal privacy
guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary side information, we rely on the
notion of differential privacy introduced relatively recently in the database
literature. This notion is extended to dynamic systems with many participants
contributing independent input signals, and mechanisms are then proposed to
solve the H2 filtering problem with a differential privacy constraint. A method
for mitigating the impact of the privacy-inducing mechanism on the estimation
performance is described, which relies on controlling the Hinfinity norm of the

These invariants are represented rather by false, quasi-modular, Ramanujan

One estimates the complexity of exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$ by the minimal complexity
of some separating from the infinity 3-dimensional submanifold. These
separating manifolds can be chosen, in some exotic $\mathbb{R}^4$'s, to be
homology 3-spheres. The invariants of such homology 3-spheres are, again,

isochronous oscillations, they are effectively one degree of freedom systems

\emph{nonsingular} and the corresponding Newton's equation of motion is
constraint free. The procedure is first illustrated for two dimensional systems
and subsequently extended to $N$-dimensional systems. The general solution of
these systems are obtained by integrating the underlying equations and is shown
to admit isochronous as well as amplitude independent quasiperiodic solutions

atomic systems, such as ensembles of trapped atoms, Bose gases with conserved
and unconserved number of atoms, vibrating atoms in double-well lattices,
Holstein-Primakoff magnons, Schwinger bosons, slave bosons, and the
condensation of singletons and triplons. The basic difference is that the
system of particles, whose total number is conserved, can form equilibrium as
well as nonequilibrium condensates, while unconserved particles can condense
only in a nonequilibrium system subject to external pumping supporting the
density of these particles sufficient for their condensation. The examples of
such a nonequilibrium condensation of unconserved particles are the
Bose-Einstein condensation of excitons, polaritons, and photons. Elementary
collective excitations, such as bogolons and phonons, being self-consistently
defined, do not condense. Magnons cannot condense in equilibrium systems.
Controversies, existing in literature with regard to the Bose-Einstein
condensation of some quasiparticles, are explained. Pushing a system out of
equilibrium may favor the condensation of unconserved quasiparticles, but
suppresses the condensate fraction of conserved particles.

which quality the adjective describes. In some other adjectival sentences with
an appropriate noun, that noun plays the same part as 'colour' and seems to be
relevant to the description of the adjective. These appropriate nouns can
usually be used in elementary sentences like 'The leather had some colour', but
in many cases they have a more or less obligatory modifier. For example, you
can hardly mention that an object has a colour without qualifying that colour
at all. About 300 French nouns are appropriate in at least one adjectival
sentence and have an obligatory modifier. They enter in a number of sentence
structures related by several syntactic transformations. The appropriateness of
the noun and the fact that the modifier is obligatory are reflected in these
transformations. The description of these syntactic phenomena provides a basis

motivation on the design of local search techniques for multiobjective
combinatorial optimization (MOCO). Indeed, when connectedness holds, a basic
Pareto local search, initialized with at least one non-dominated solution,
allows to identify the efficient set exhaustively. However, this becomes
quickly infeasible in practice as the number of efficient solutions typically
grows exponentially with the instance size. As a consequence, we generally have
to deal with a limited-size approximation, where a good sample set has to be
found. In this paper, we propose the biobjective multiple and long path
problems to show experimentally that, on the first problems, even if the
efficient set is connected, a local search may be outperformed by a simple
evolutionary algorithm in the sampling of the efficient set. At the opposite,
on the second problems, a local search algorithm may successfully approximate a
disconnected efficient set. Then, we argue that connectedness is not the single
property to study for the design of local search heuristics for MOCO. This work
opens new discussions on a proper definition of the multiobjective fitness

super-Chandrasekhar-mass (super-Ch-mass) WDs are constructed, and multi-color
light curves (LCs) are calculated. The comparison between our calculations and
the observations of SN 2009dc suggests that the exploding WD has a super-Ch
mass of 2.2-2.4 solar masses, producing 1.2-1.4 solar masses of Ni-56, if the
extinction by its host galaxy is negligible. If the extinction is significant,
the exploding WD is as massive as \sim2.8 solar masses, and \sim1.8 solar
masses of Ni-56 is necessary to account for the observations. Whether the
host-galaxy extinction is significant or not, the progenitor WD must have a
thick carbon-oxygen layer in the outermost zone (20-30% of the WD mass), which
explains the observed low expansion velocity of the ejecta and the presence of
carbon. Our estimate on the mass of the progenitor WD, especially for the
extinction-corrected case, is challenging to the current scenarios of SNe Ia.

diagnosing heating mechanisms. The presence and the amount of such hot plasma
is currently debated. The SphinX instrument on-board CORONAS-PHOTON mission is
sensitive to X-ray emission well above 1 keV and provides the opportunity to
detect the hot plasma component. We analyzed the X-ray spectra of the solar
corona collected by the SphinX spectrometer in May 2009 (when two active
regions were present). We modelled the spectrum extracted from the whole Sun
over a time window of 17 days in the 1.34-7 keV energy band by adopting the
latest release of the APED database. The SphinX broadband spectrum cannot be
modelled by a single isothermal component of optically thin plasma and two
components are necessary. In particular, the high statistics and the accurate
calibration of the spectrometer allowed us to detect a very hot component at ~7
million K with an emission measure of ~2.7 x 10^44 cm^-3. The X-ray emission
from the hot plasma dominates the solar X-ray spectrum above 4 keV. We checked
that this hot component is invariably present both at high and low emission
regimes, i.e. even excluding resolvable microflares. We also present and
discuss a possible non-thermal origin (compatible with a weak contribution from
thick-target bremsstrahlung) for this hard emission component. Our results
support the nanoflare scenario and might confirm that a minor flaring activity
is ever-present in the quiescent corona, as also inferred for the coronae of
other stars.

Gaussian Processes (GP) regression to obtain a continuous spectrum of brain

gravitational instability can have a significant effect on the evolution of
dust particles. Previous results using global simulations indicate that spiral
density waves are highly efficient at collecting dust particles, creating
significant local over-densities which may be able to undergo gravitational
collapse. We expand on these findings, using a range of cooling times to mimic
the conditions at a large range of radii within the disc. Here we use the
Pencil Code to solve the 2D local shearing sheet equations for gas on a fixed
grid together with the equations of motion for solids coupled to the gas solely
through aerodynamic drag force. We find that spiral density waves can create
significant enhancements in the surface density of solids, equivalent to 1-10cm
sized particles in a disc following the profiles of Clarke (2009) around a
solar mass star, causing it to reach concentrations several orders of magnitude
larger than the particles mean surface density. We also study the velocity
dispersion of the particles, finding that the spiral structure can result in
the particle velocities becoming highly ordered, having a narrow velocity
dispersion. This implies low relative velocities between particles, which in
turn suggests that collisions are typically low energy, lessening the
likelihood of grain destruction. Both these findings suggest that the density
waves that arise due to gravitational instabilities in the early stages of star
formation provide excellent sites for the formation of large,
planetesimal-sized objects.

the Planar Dominating Set problem by Alber et al. [JACM 2004], later improved
to 67k by Chen et al. [SICOMP 2007]. This result means roughly, that the
problem of finding the smallest dominating set in a planar graph is easy when
the optimal solution is small. On the other hand, it is known that Planar
Dominating Set parameterized by k'=|V|-k (also known as Planar Nonblocker) has
a kernel of size 2k'. This means that Planar Dominating Set is easy when the
optimal solution is very large. We improve the kernel for Planar Nonblocker to
7/4k'. This also implies that Planar Dominating Set has no kernel of size at
most (7/3-epsilon)k, for any epsilon>0, unless P=NP. This improves the previous
lower bound of (2-epsilon)k of Chen et al. Both of these results immediately
generalize to H-minor free graphs (without changing the constants). In our
proof of the bound on the kernel size we use a variant of the discharging
method (used e.g. in the proof of the four color theorem). We give some
arguments that this method is natural in the context of kernelization and we
hope it will be applied to get improved kernel size bounds for other problems
as well. As a by-product we show a result which might be of independent
interest: every n-vertex graph with no isolated vertices and such that every
pair of degree 1 vertices is at distance at least 5 and every pair of degree 2

Each recurrent flow represents a sustained closed cycle of dynamical processes

statistics in the spirit of Periodic Orbit Theory derived for certain types of
low dimensional chaos. The approach is found to be reasonably successful at a
low value of the forcing where the flow is close to but not fully in its
asymptotic (strongly) turbulent regime. Here, a total of 50 recurrent flows are
found with the majority buried in the part of phase space most populated by the
turbulence giving rise to a good reproduction of the energy and dissipation
probability density functions. However, at higher forcing amplitudes now in the
asymptotic turbulent regime, the generated turbulence data set proves
insufficiently long to yield enough recurrent flows to make viable predictions.
Despite this, the general approach seems promising providing enough simulation
data is available since it is open to extensive automation and naturally
generates dynamically important exact solutions for the flow.

spinning neutron star as a core, and a slowly rotating envelope. We found that
the core could be braked quickly to an extremely long spin period by the
coupling between its magnetic field and the envelope, and that the envelope
could be disrupted by some powerful bursts or exhausted via stellar wind. If
the envelope is disrupted after the core has spun down, the core will become an
extremely long-period compact object, with a slow proper motion speed,
surrounded by a supernova-remnant-like shell. These features all agree with the
observations of 1E161348-5055. TZOs are expected to have produced extraordinary
high abundances of lithium and rapid proton process elements that would remain
in the remnants and could be used to test this scenario.

systems, a quantum realization of black holes requires an operator algebra of
the fundamental observables of the theory which is introduced in this study
based on aspects of loop quantum gravity. From the eigenvalue spectra of the
quantum operators for the black hole area, charge and angular momentum, it is
demonstrated that a strict bound on the extensive parameters, different from
the relation arising in classical general relativity, holds, implying that the
extremal black hole state can neither be measured nor can its existence be
proven. This is, as turns out, a result of the specific form of the chosen
angular momentum operator and the corresponding eigenvalue spectrum, or rather
the quantum measurement process of angular momentum. Quantum mechanical
considerations and the lowest, non-zero eigenvalue of the loop quantum gravity
black hole mass spectrum indicate, on the one hand, a physical Planck scale

multiple mass distributions are often equally compatible with the observed
properties of the images. Besides using clear examples to illustrate the effect
of the so-called monopole and mass sheet degeneracies, this article introduces
the most general form of said mass sheet degeneracy. While the well known
version of this degeneracy rescales a single source plane, this generalization
allows any number of sources to be rescaled. Furthermore, it shows how it is
possible to rescale each of those sources with a different scale factor. Apart
from illustrating that the mass sheet degeneracy is not broken by the presence
of multiple sources at different redshifts, it will become apparent that the
newly constructed mass distribution necessarily alters the existing mass
density precisely at the locations of the images in the lens system, and that
this change in mass density is linked to the factors with which the sources
were rescaled. Combined with the fact that the monopole degeneracy introduces a
large amount of uncertainty about the density in between the images, this means
that both degeneracies are in fact closely related to substructure in the mass
distribution. An example simulated lensing situation based on an elliptical
version of a Navarro-Frenk-White profile explicitly shows that such
degeneracies are not easily broken by observational constraints, even when
multiple sources are present. Instead, the fact that each lens inversion method
makes certain assumptions, implicit or explicit, about the smoothness of the
mass distribution means that in practice the degeneracies are broken in an
artificial manner rather than by observed properties of the lens system.

number counts and spectral indices of extragalactic sources -- infrared and
radio sources -- from the Planck Early Catalogue (ERCSC) at 100 to 857GHz. Our
sample contains, after the 80% completeness cut, between 122 and 452 and
sources, with flux densities above 0.3 and 1.9Jy at 100 and 857GHz, over about
31 to 40% of the sky. Using Planck HFI, all the sources have been classified as
either dust-dominated or synchrotron-dominated on the basis of their spectral
energy distributions (SED). Our sample is thus complete, flux-limited and
color-selected to differentiate between the two populations. We find an
approximately equal number of synchrotron and dusty sources between 217 and
353GHz; at 353GHz or higher (or 217GHz and lower) frequencies, the number is
dominated by dusty (synchrotron) sources, as expected. For most of the sources,
the spectral indices are also derived. We provide for the first time counts of
bright sources from 353 to 857GHz and the contributions from dusty and
synchrotron sources at all HFI frequencies in the key spectral range where
these spectra are crossing. The observed counts are in the Euclidean regime.
The number counts are compared to previously published data (earlier Planck,
Herschel, BLAST, SCUBA, LABOCA, SPT, and ACT) and models taking into account
both radio or infrared galaxies. We derive the multi-frequency Euclidean level
and compare it to WMAP, Spitzer and IRAS results. The submillimetre number
counts are not well reproduced by current evolution models of dusty galaxies,
whereas the millimetre part appears reasonably well fitted by the most recent
model for synchrotron-dominated sources. Finally we provide estimates of the
local luminosity density of dusty galaxies, providing the first such
measurements at 545 and 857GHz.

chunked codes (CC) over packet networks with delay and loss is considered. For
networks with feedback, two scheduling policies, referred to as random push
(RP) and local-rarest-first (LRF), already exist. We propose a new scheduling
policy, referred to as minimum-distance-first (MDF), based on the expected
number of innovative successful packet transmissions at each node of the
network prior to the ""next"" transmission time, given the feedback information
from the downstream node(s) about the received packets. Unlike the existing
policies, the MDF policy incorporates loss and delay models of the link in the
selection process of the chunk to be transmitted. Our simulations show that MDF
significantly reduces the expected time required for all the chunks (or
equivalently, all the message packets) to be decodable compared to the existing
scheduling policies for line networks with feedback. The improvements are
particularly profound (up to about 46% for the tested cases) for smaller chunks
and larger networks which are of more practical interest. The improvement in
the performance of the proposed scheduling policy comes at the cost of more
computations, and a slight increase in the amount of feedback. We also propose
a low-complexity version of MDF with a rather small loss in the performance,
referred to as minimumcurrent-metric-first (MCMF). The MCMF policy is based on
the expected number of innovative packet transmissions prior to the ""current""
transmission time, as opposed to the next transmission time, used in MDF. Our
simulations (over line networks) demonstrate that MCMF is always superior to RP
and LRF policies, and the superiority becomes more pronounced for smaller
chunks and larger networks.

not only inertia, but also space and time emerge from the interaction of
matter. Concepts of a Machian/relational theory are proposed, where inertia and
energy are defined as mutual properties between pairs of objects. Due to
Berkeley, only radial motion represents kinetic energy between (point) masses,
which is the basis of anisotropic inertia, which in turn underlies the
relational principle. The Newtonian definition of potential energy is
considered a model for Machian inertia, leading to a frame independent
definition of Machian kinetic energy, which comprises of the Newtonian terms
(relative to the ""fixed stars"") and small anisotropic Machian energy terms
between objects. The latter account for relativistic trajectories, such as the
anomalous perihelion precession and Lense-Thirring frame dragging. However,
relativistic effects of remote observation (e.g. time dilation) demand an
isotropic model. A relational spacetime metric is derived, which provides an
isotropic coordinate transform of the anisotropic Machian model, yielding a
relational model which matches GR expressions for relativistic trajectories and
effects of remote observation. Therefore, the experimental verification of GR
in these cases holds automatically for the relational model. The relational
model fits the relational principle (including Mach's principle) and it is
argued that it includes GR as a special case. The relational metric provides
both contraction and (unbound) expansion as a function of relative potential,
i.e. without invoking dark energy.

beams carrying non-integer orbital angular momentum (OAM) using
Hermite-Laguerre-Gaussian (HLG) modes. Different from previous techniques, the
symmetry axes of our beams are fixed when varying the OAM; this simplifies the
calibration technique for beam positional measurement using a quadrant
detector. We have also demonstrated analytically and experimentally that both
the OAM value and the HLG mode orientation play an important role in the
quadrant detector response. The assumption that a quadrant detector is most
sensitive at the beam center does not always hold for anisotropic beam
profiles, such as HLG beams.
