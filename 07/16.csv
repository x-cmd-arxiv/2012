redshifted to the observed visible. In particular, we search for a UV bump and
related implications for dust attenuation determinations. We use data in the
CDFS, obtained in intermediate and broad band filters by the MUSYC project, to
sample the UV rest-frame of 751 galaxies with 0.95<z<2.2. When available,
Herschel/PACS data (GOODS-Herschel project), and Spitzer/MIPS measurements, are
used to estimate the dust emission. The SED of each source is fit using the
CIGALE code. The amount of dust attenuation and the dust attenuation curve are
obtained as outputs of the SED fitting process, together with other parameters
linked to the SFH. The global amount of dust attenuation at UV wavelengths is
found to increase with stellar mass and to decrease as UV luminosity increases.
A UV bump at 2175A is securely detected in 20% of the galaxies, and the mean
amplitude of the bump for the sample is similar to that observed in the LMC
supershell region. This amplitude is found to be lower in galaxies with very
high SSFRs, and 90% of the galaxies exhibiting a secure bump are at z<1.5. The
attenuation curve is confirmed to be steeper than that of local starburst
galaxies for 20$% of the galaxies. The large dispersion found for these two
parameters describing the attenuation law is likely to reflect a wide diversity
of attenuation laws among galaxies. The relations between dust attenuation,
IR-to-UV flux ratio, and the slope of the UV continuum are derived for the mean
attenuation curve found for our sample. Deviations from the average trends are
found to correlate with the age of the young stellar population and the shape
of the attenuation curve.(abriged)

research. Billions of short reads generated at low costs can be assembled for
reconstructing the whole genomes. Unfortunately, the large memory footprint of
the existing de novo assembly algorithms makes it challenging to get the
assembly done for higher eukaryotes like mammals. In this work, we investigate
the memory issue of constructing de Bruijn graph, a core task in leading
assembly algorithms, which often consumes several hundreds of gigabytes memory
for large genomes. We propose a disk-based partition method, called Minimum
Substring Partitioning (MSP), to complete the task using less than 10 gigabytes
memory, without runtime slowdown. MSP breaks the short reads into multiple
small disjoint partitions so that each partition can be loaded into memory,
processed individually and later merged with others to form a de Bruijn graph.
By leveraging the overlaps among the k-mers (substring of length k), MSP
achieves astonishing compression ratio: The total size of partitions is reduced
from $\Theta(kn)$ to $\Theta(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the short read
database, and $k$ is the length of a $k$-mer. Experimental results show that
our method can build de Bruijn graphs using a commodity computer for any

are known in star clusters. To explain the lack of short-period giant planets
in globular clusters (GC), such as 47 Tucane and \omega\ Centauri, it has been
suggested that their low metallicities may have prevented planet formation.
Alternatively, the high rates of close stellar encounters in these clusters may
have influenced the formation and subsequent evolution of planetary systems.
How common are planets in clusters around normal main-sequence stars? Here we
consider whether this question can be addressed using data from the Kepler
mission. The Kepler field of view contains 4 low-density (relative to GCs) open
clusters where the metallicities are about solar (or even higher) and stellar
encounters are much less frequent than in typical GCs. We provide detailed
$N$-body models and show that most planets in Kepler-detectable orbits are not
significantly perturbed by stellar encounters in these open clusters. We focus
on the most massive cluster, NGC 6791, which has super-solar metallicity, and
find that if planets formed in this cluster at the same frequency as observed
in the field, Kepler could detect 1 -- 20 transiting planets depending on the
planet-size distribution and the duration of data collection. Due to the large
distance to NGC 6791 Kepler will have to search relatively faint ($K_p<20$)
stars for the full extended mission to achieve such a yield.

disturbance that propagates in cortical brain tissue. In addition to massive
cellular depolarization, CSD also involves significant changes in perfusion and
metabolism -- aspects of CSD that had not been modeled and are important to
traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, stroke, and migraine.
  In this study, we develop a mathematical model for CSD where we focus on
modeling the features essential to understanding the implications of
neurovascular coupling during CSD. In our model, the sodium-potassium--ATPase,
mainly responsible for ionic homeostasis and active during CSD, operates at a
rate that is dependent on the supply of oxygen. The supply of oxygen is
determined by modeling blood flow through a lumped vascular tree with an
effective local vessel radius that is controlled by the extracellular potassium
concentration. We show that during CSD, the metabolic demands of the cortex
exceed the physiological limits placed on oxygen delivery, regardless of
vascular constriction or dilation. However, vasoconstriction and vasodilation
play important roles in the propagation of CSD and its recovery. Our model
replicates the qualitative and quantitative behavior of CSD --
vasoconstriction, oxygen depletion, extracellular potassium elevation,
prolonged depolarization -- found in experimental studies.
  We predict faster, longer duration CSD in vivo than in vitro due to the
contribution of the vasculature. Our results also help explain some of the
variability of CSD between species and even within the same animal. These
results have clinical and translational implications, as they allow for more
precise in vitro, in vivo, and in silico exploration of a phenomenon broadly
relevant to neurological disease.

spatial mixing) implies FPTAS on planar graphs. The framework for the counting
problems considered by us is the Holant problems with arbitrary constant-size
domain and symmetric constraint functions. We define a notion of regularity on
the constraint functions, which covers a wide range of natural and important
counting problems, including all multi-state spin systems, counting graph
homomorphisms, counting weighted matchings or perfect matchings, the subgraphs
world problem transformed from the ferromagnetic Ising model, and all counting
CSPs and Holant problems with symmetric constraint functions of constant arity.
  The core of our algorithm is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm which
computes the exact values of the Holant problems with regular constraint
functions on graphs of bounded treewidth. By utilizing the locally tree-like
property of apex-minor-free families of graphs, the parameterized exact
algorithm implies an FPTAS for the Holant problem on these graph families
whenever the Gibbs measure defined by the problem exhibits strong spatial
mixing. We further extend the recursive coupling technique to Holant problems
and establish strong spatial mixing for the ferromagnetic Potts model and the
subgraphs world problem. As consequences, we have new deterministic
approximation algorithms on planar graphs and all apex-minor-free graphs for

unpolarized state provides a particularly striking realization of ""spin charge

results in shear bands in amorphous solids remains unknown despite enormous
amount of research, both experimental and theoretical. As this is the main
mechanism for the failure of metallic glasses, understanding the instability is
invaluable in finding how to stabilize such materials against the tendency to
shear localize. In this Letter we explain the mechanism for shear localization
under shear, which is the appearance of highly correlated lines of Eshelby-like
quadrupolar singularities which organize the non-affine plastic flow of the
amorphous solid into a shear band. We prove analytically that such highly
correlated solutions in which $\C N$ quadrupoles are aligned with equal
orientations are minimum energy states when the strain is high enough. The line
lies at 45 degrees to the compressive stress.

evidenced by the fact that the magnetic permeability of nearly all materials is
unity in the optical frequency range, and that magneto-optical devices (such as
Faraday isolators) must be large in order to allow for a sufficiently strong
effect. In graphene, however, it has been shown that inhomogeneous strains can
induce 'pseudomagnetic fields' that behave very similarly to real fields. Here,
we show experimentally and theoretically that, by properly structuring a
dielectric lattice, it is possible to induce a pseudomagnetic field at optical
frequencies in a photonic lattice, where the propagation dynamics is equivalent
to the evolution of an electronic wavepacket in graphene. To our knowledge,
this is the first realization of a pseudomagnetic field in optics. The induced
field gives rise to multiple photonic Landau levels (singularities in the
density of states) separated by band gaps. We show experimentally and
numerically that the gaps between these Landau levels give rise to transverse
confinement of the optical modes. The use of strain allows for the exploration
of magnetic effects in a non-resonant way that would be otherwise inaccessible
in optics. Employing inhomogeneous strain to induce pseudomagnetism suggests
the possibility that aperiodic photonic crystal structures can achieve greater
field-enhancement and slow-light effects than periodic structures via the high
density-of-states at Landau levels. Generalizing these concepts to other
systems beyond optics, for example with matter waves in optical potentials,
offers new intriguing physics that is fundamentally different from that in
purely periodic structures.

group G. Zaslavsky proposed two matroids of G-gain graphs, called frame
matroids and lift matroids, and investigated linear representations of them.
Each matroid has a canonical representation over a field F if G is isomorphic
to a subgroup of F^{\times} in the case of frame matroids or G is isomorphic to
an additive subgroup of F in the case of lift matroids. The canonical
representation of the frame matroid of a complete graph is also known as a
Dowling geometry, as it was first introduced by Dowling for finite groups.
  In this paper, we extend these matroids in two ways. The first one is
extending the rank function of each matroid, based on submodular functions over
G. The resulting rank function generalizes that of the union of frame matroids
or lift matroids. Another one is extending the canonical linear representation
of the union of d copies of a frame matroid or a lift matroid, based on linear
representations of G on a d-dimensional vector space. We show that linear
matroids of the latter extension are indeed special cases of the first
extensions, as in the relation between Dowling geometries and frame matroids.
We also discuss an attempt to unify the extension of frame matroids and that of
lift matroids.
  This work is motivated from recent research on the combinatorial rigidity of
symmetric graphs. As special cases, we give several new results on this topic,
including combinatorial characterizations of the symmetry-forced rigidity of
generic body-bar frameworks with point group symmetries or crystallographic
symmetries and the symmetric parallel redrawability of generic bar-joint
frameworks with point group symmetries or crystallographic symmetries.

although it does not in general yield Einstein amplitudes, we can nevertheless
obtain some partial twistor-string interpretation of the remarkable formulae
recently been found by Hodges and generalized to all tree amplitudes by Cachazo
and Skinner. The Hodges matrix and its higher degree generalizations encode the
world sheet correlators of the twistor string. These matrices control both
Einstein amplitudes and those of the conformal gravity arising from the Witten
and Berkovits twistor-string. Amplitudes in the latter case arise from products
of the diagonal elements of the generalized Hodges matrices and reduced
determinants give the former. The reduced determinants arise if the
contractions in the worldsheet correlator are restricted to form connected
trees at MHV. The (generalized) Hodges matrices arise as weighted Laplacian
matrices for the graph of possible contractions in the correlators and the
reduced determinants of these weighted Laplacian matrices give the sum of of
the connected tree contributions by an extension of the Matrix-Tree theorem.

Here, we define quantitative singular strata $\cS^j_{\eta,r}$ satisfying

satisfies $\Vol (T_r(\cS^j_{\eta,r})\cap B_1)\leq Cr^{N+2-j-\varepsilon}$. Our
primary application of this is to higher regularity of Brakke flows starting at
$k$-convex smooth compact embedded hypersurfaces. To this end, we prove that
for the flow of $k$-convex hypersurfaces, any backwards selfsimilar limit flow
with at least $k$ symmetries is in fact a static multiplicity one plane. Then,

$L^p$-estimates for the second fundamental form for any $p<n+1-k$. In fact, the

modification in Friedmann's equation which prevent the big rip singularity.
Recently in \cite{h12} it has been proved that this modified Friedmann equation
is obtained in an inconsistent way, what means that the results deduced from
it, in particular the big rip singularity avoidance, are not justified. The
problem is that holonomy corrections modify the gravitational part of the
Hamiltonian of the system leading, after Legendre's transformation, to a non
covariant Lagrangian which is in contradiction with one of the main principles
of General Relativity. A more consistent way to deal with the big rip
singularity avoidance is to disregard modification in the gravitational part of
the Hamiltonian, and only consider inverse volume effects \cite{bo02a}. In this
case we will see that, not like the big bang singularity, the big rip
singularity survives in loop quantum cosmology. Another way to deal with the
big rip avoidance is to take into account geometric quantum effects given by
the the Wheeler-De Witt equation. In that case, even though the wave packets
spread, the expectation values satisfy the same equations as their classical
analogues. Then, following the viewpoint adopted in loop quantum cosmology, one
can conclude that the big rip singularity survives when one takes into account
these quantum effects. However, the spreading of the wave packets prevents the
recover of the semiclassical time, and thus, one might conclude that the
classical evolution of the universe come to and end before the big rip is
reached. This is not conclusive because. as we will see, it always exists other
external times that allows us to define the classical and quantum evolution of
the universe up to the big rip singularity.

diameter $D$ of directed or undirected graphs. In a seminal paper, Aingworth,
Chekuri, Indyk and Motwani [SIAM J. Comput. 1999] presented an algorithm that
computes in $\Ot(m\sqrt n + n^2)$ time an estimate $\hat{D}$ for the diameter
of an $n$-node, $m$-edge graph, such that $\lfloor 2/3 D \rfloor \leq \hat{D}
\leq D$. In this paper we present an algorithm that produces the same estimate
in $\Ot(m\sqrt n)$ expected running time. We then provide strong evidence that
a better approximation may be hard to obtain if we insist on an $O(m^{2-\eps})$
running time. In particular, we show that if there is some constant $\eps>0$ so
that there is an algorithm for undirected unweighted graphs that runs in
$O(m^{2-\eps})$ time and produces an approximation $\hat{D}$ such that $
(2/3+\eps) D \leq \hat{D} \leq D$, then SAT for CNF formulas on $n$ variables
can be solved in $O^{*}((2-\delta)^{n})$ time for some constant $\delta>0$, and
the strong exponential time hypothesis of [Impagliazzo, Paturi, Zane JCSS'01]
is false.
  Motivated by this somewhat negative result, we study whether it is possible
to obtain a better approximation for specific cases. For unweighted directed or
undirected graphs, we show that if $D=3h+z$, where $h\geq 0$ and $z\in
{0,1,2}$, then it is possible to report in $\tilde{O}(\min{m^{2/3}
n^{4/3},m^{2-1/(2h+3)}})$ time an estimate $\hat{D}$ such that $2h+z \leq
\hat{D}\leq D$, thus giving a better than 3/2 approximation whenever $z\neq 0$.
This is significant for constant values of $D$ which is exactly when the
diameter approximation problem is hardest to solve. For the case of unweighted
undirected graphs we present an $\tilde{O}(m^{2/3} n^{4/3})$ time algorithm
that reports an estimate $\hat{D}$ such that $\lfloor 4D/5\rfloor \leq
\hat{D}\leq D$.

with internal skeletons is how an internal skeleton evolved in the first place.
Computational modeling of the development of bilateral symmetric organisms
suggests an answer to this question. Our hypothesis is that an internal
skeleton may have evolved from a bilaterally symmetric ancestor with an
external skeleton. By growing the organism inside-out an external skeleton
becomes an internal skeleton. Our hypothesis is supported by a computational
theory of bilateral symmetry that allows us to model and simulate this process.
Inside-out development is achieved by an orientation switch. Given the
development of two bilateral founder cells that generate a bilateral organism,
a mutation that reverses the internal mirror orientation of those bilateral
founder cells leads to inside-out development. The new orientation is
epigenetically inherited by all progeny. A key insight is that each cell
contained in the newly evolved organism with the internal skeleton develops
according to the very same downstream developmental control network that
directs the development of its exoskeletal ancestor. The networks and their
genomes are are identical, but the interpretation is different because of the
cell's inverted orientation. The result is inside-out bilateral symmetric
development generating an inside-out organism with an internal skeleton.

have rather uniform widths and can be described with the so-called Plummer
profiles. The shapes of the filament profiles are linked to their physical
state. Before drawing conclusions on the observed column density profiles, we
must evaluate the observational uncertainties. We want to estimate the bias
that could result from radiative transfer effects or from variations of submm
dust emissivity. We use cloud models obtained with magnetohydrodynamic
simulations and carry out radiative transfer calculations to produce maps of
sub-millimetre emission. Column densities are estimated based on the synthetic
observations. For selected filaments, the estimated profiles are compared to
those derived from the original column density. Possible effects from spatial
variations of dust properties are examined. With instrumental noise typical of
the Herschel observations, the parameters derived for nearby clouds are correct
to within a few percent. The radiative transfer effects have only a minor
effect on the results. If the signal-to-noise ratio is degraded by a factor of
four, the errors become significant and for half of the examined filaments the
values cannot be constrained. The errors increase in proportion to the cloud
distance. Assuming the resolution of Herschel instruments, the model filaments
are barely resolved at a distance of ~400 pc and the errors in the parameters
of the Plummer function are several tens of per cent. The Plummer parameters,
in particular the power-law exponent p, are sensitive to noise but can be
determined with good accuracy using Herschel data. One must be cautious about
possible line-of-sight confusion. In our models, a large fraction of the
filaments seen in the column density maps are not continuous structures in
three dimensions.

potentials confined between competing parallel walls. One wall is solvophilic
and would be completely wet at bulk liquid-gas coexistence while the other is
solvophobic and would be completely dry at bulk coexistence. When the wall
separation L is large and the system is below the bulk critical temperature and
close to bulk liquid-gas coexistence, a `delocalized interface' or `soft mode'
phase forms with a liquid-gas interface near to the centre of the slit; this
interacts with the walls via the power-law tails of the interparticle
potentials. We use a coarse-grained effective Hamiltonian approach to derive
explicit scaling expressions for the Gibbs adsorption, the surface tension, the
solvation force and the total susceptibility. Using a non-local density
functional theory (DFT) we calculate density profiles for the asymmetrically
confined fluid at different chemical potentials and, for sufficiently large L,
confirm the scaling predictions for the four thermodynamic quantities. Since
the upper critical dimension for complete wetting with power-law potentials is
<3 we argue that our (mean-field) scaling predictions should remain valid in
treatments that incorporate the effects of interfacial fluctuations. As the
wall separation L is decreased at bulk liquid-gas coexistence we predict a
capillary evaporation transition from the `delocalized interface' phase to a
dilute gas state with just a thin adsorbed film of liquid-like density next to
the solvophilic wall. This transition is connected closely to the first order
pre-wetting transition which occurs at the solvophilic wall in the
semi-infinite system. We compare the phase diagram for the competing walls
system with the phase diagrams for the fluid confined between identical

not require numerical quadratures, and approximates accurately all

linearly in the number of classes. The predictive accuracy of the nested EP
approach is compared to Laplace, variational Bayes, and Markov chain Monte

pre-log factor 1/2 in a half-duplex mode, we consider alternate transmission
protocol among three relays where two relays and the other relay alternately
forward messages from source to destination. We consider a multiple-antenna
environment where all nodes have $M$ antennas. Aligning the inter-relay
interference due to the alternate transmission is utilized to make additional
degrees of freedom (DOFs) and recover the pre-log factor loss. It is shown that
the proposed relaying scheme can achieve $\frac{3M}{4}$ DOFs compared with the
$\frac{M}{2}$ DOFs of conventional AF relaying. In addition, suboptimal linear
filter designs for a source and three relays are proposed to maximize the
system achievable sum-rate for different fading scenarios when the destination
utilizes a linear minimum mean-square error filter for decoding. We verify from
our selected numerical results that the proposed filter designs give
significant improvement over a naive filter or conventional relaying schemes.

strongly depends on the thermal conductivity of the mantle with minor influence
of the thermal conductivity of the chondrule. The size ratio between rim and

ensemble averages of the microcanonical acceptance probabilities of switching
between these Hamiltonians, analogously to the case of Bennett's acceptance
ratio method for the canonical ensemble [C. H. Bennett, J. Comput. Phys., 22,
245 (1976)]. Thus, if the DOS of one of the systems is known, one obtains those
of the others and, hence, the partition functions. As a simple test case, the
vapor pressure of an anharmonic Einstein crystal is computed, using the
harmonic Einstein crystal as the reference system in one dimension; an
auxiliary calculation is also performed in three dimensions. As a further
example of the algorithm, the energy dependence of the ratio of the DOS of the
square-well and hard-sphere tetradecamers is determined, from which the
temperature dependence of the constant-volume heat capacity of the square-well
system is calculated and compared with canonical Metropolis Monte Carlo
estimates. For these cases and reference systems, the perturbation calculations
exhibit a higher degree of convergence per Monte Carlo cycle than Wang-Landau
(WL) sampling, although for the one-dimensional oscillator the WL sampling is
ultimately more efficient for long runs. Last, we calculate the vapor pressure
of liquid gold using an empirical Sutton-Chen many-body potential and the ideal
gas as the reference state. Although this proves the general applicability of
the method, by its inherent perturbation approach, the algorithm is suitable
for those particular cases where the properties of a related system are well

normal products of free massless scalar fields with an O(N), U(N), or Sp(2N)

precisely a CFT with an infinite series of conserved currents. We shall recast

for D>3 under additional assumptions about the operator product algebra. In

tool, which takes into account nebular emission, we explore a wide parameter
space. We also explore a set of different star formation histories. Nebular
emission is found to significantly affect the determination of the physical
parameters for the majority of $z \sim $ 3--6 LBGs. We identify two populations
of galaxies by determining the importance of the contribution of emission lines
to broadband fluxes. We find that $\sim$ $65\%$ of LBGs show detectable signs
of emission lines, whereas $\sim$ $35\%$ show weak or no emission lines. This
distribution is found over the entire redshift range. We interpret these groups
as actively star forming and more quiescent LBGs, respectively. We find that it
is necessary to considerer SED fits with very young ages ($<50$ Myr) to
reproduce some colours affected by strong emission lines. Other arguments
favouring episodic star formation and relatively short star formation
timescales are also discussed. Considering nebular emission generally leads to
a younger age, lower stellar mass, higher dust attenuation, higher star
formation rate, and a large scatter in the SFR-$M_{\star}$ relation. Our
analysis yields a trend of increasing specific star formation rate with
redshift, as predicted by recent galaxy evolution models. The physical
parameters of approximately two thirds of high redshift galaxies are
significantly modified when we account for nebular emission. The SED models
which include nebular emission shed new light on the properties of LBGs with
numerous important implications.

classification (ergodicity, transience) of a family of random trees. In the
basic model, new edges appear according to a Poisson process of parameter
$\lambda$ and leaves can be deleted at a rate $\mu$. The main results lay the
stress on the famous number $e$. A complete classification of the process is
given in terms of the intensity factor $\rho=\lambda/\mu $: it is ergodic if
$\rho\leq e^{-1}$, and transient if $\rho>e^{-1}$. There is a phase transition
phenomenon: the usual region of null recurrence (in the parameter space) here
does not exist. This fact is rare for countable Markov chains with
exponentially distributed jumps. Some basic stationary laws are computed, e.g.
the number of vertices and the height. Various bounds, limit laws and
ergodic-like theorems are obtained, both for the transient and ergodic regimes.
In particular, when the system is transient, the height of the tree grows
linearly as the time $t\to\infty$, at a rate which is explicitly computed. Some
of the results are extended to the so-called multiclass model.

a factor of 100. The collision experiments also show that a highly porous
dust-aggregate can retain its highly porous core if collisions get more
energetic and a denser shell forms on top of the porous core. We measure the
mechanical properties of cm-sized dust samples of different filling factors

varies between 1 kPa and 6 kPa. The sound speed is determined by a runtime

of all-sky, few arcminute resolution maps of sky emission at submillimetre to
centimetre wavelengths, in both intensity and polarisation. Several options are
implemented to model the cosmic microwave background, Galactic diffuse emission
(synchrotron, free-free, thermal and spinning dust, CO lines), Galactic H-II
regions, extragalactic radio sources, dusty galaxies, and thermal and kinetic
Sunyaev-Zeldovich signals from clusters of galaxies. Each component is
simulated by means of educated interpolations/extrapolations of data sets
available at the time of the launch of the Planck mission, complemented by
state-of-the-art models of the emission. Distinctive features of the
simulations are: spatially varying spectral properties of synchrotron and dust;
different spectral parameters for each point source; modeling of the clustering
properties of extragalactic sources and of the power spectrum of fluctuations
in the cosmic infrared background. The PSM enables the production of random
realizations of the sky emission, constrained to match observational data
within their uncertainties, and is implemented in a software package that is
regularly updated with incoming information from observations. The model is
expected to serve as a useful tool for optimizing planned microwave and
sub-millimetre surveys and to test data processing and analysis pipelines. It
is, in particular, used for the development and validation of data analysis
pipelines within the planck collaboration. A version of the software that can
be used for simulating the observations for a variety of experiments is made

far been unsuccessful, despite the expectation that they are luminous

affects their visual appearances, and discuss the implications for the
detectability of SN Ibc progenitors. Massive WR stars that rapidly lose their
helium envelopes through stellar-wind mass-loss end their lives when their
effective temperatures -- related to their hydrostatic surfaces -- exceed about
150kK.At their pre-supernova stage, their surface properties resemble those of
hot Galactic WR stars of WO sub-type. These are visually faint with narrow-band
visual magnitudes Mv = -1.5 ~ -2.5, despite their high bolometric luminosities
(log L/Lsun = 5.6 ~ 5.7), compared to the bulk of Galactic WR stars (Mv < -4).
In contrast, relatively low-mass helium stars that retain a thick helium
envelope appear fairly bright in optical bands, depending on the final masses
and the history of the envelope expansion during the late evolutionary stages.
We conclude that SNe Ibc observations have so far not provided strong
constraints on progenitor bolometric luminosities and masses, even with the
deepest searches. We also argue that Ic progenitors are more challenging to
identify than Ib progenitors in any optical images.

Telescope (HST), assuming a concordance LCDM cosmology. For both methods, we
find that the recovered values of the cosmological parameters, and the global
nuisance parameters controlling the stretch and colour corrections to the
supernovae lightcurves, suffer from small biasses. The magnitude of the biasses
is similar in both cases, with the BHM yielding slightly more accurate results,
in particular for cosmological parameters when applied to just the SNLS3 single
survey data sets. Most notably, in this case, the biasses in the recovered
matter density $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$ are in opposite directions for the two
methods. For any given realisation of the SNLS3-type data, this can result in a
$\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy in the estimated value of $\Omega_{\rm m,0}$
between the two methods, which we find to be the case for real SNLS3 data. As
more higher and lower redshift SNIa samples are included, however, the
cosmological parameter estimates of the two methods converge.

dominated by advection of particles with Alfven waves to a regime where
diffusion in the turbulence generated by the same CRs is dominant. A second
break at R\simeq 200 GV happens when the diffusive propagation is no longer
determined by the self-generated turbulence, but rather by the cascading of
externally generated turbulence (for instance due to supernova (SN) bubbles)
from large spatial scales to smaller scales where CRs can resonate.

haloes of galaxies along the SNIa lines-of-sight via their gravitational
lensing effect. The full joint posterior distribution of the dark matter halo
parameters is explored using the nested sampling algorithm {\sc MultiNest},
which also efficiently calculates the Bayesian evidence, thereby facilitating
robust model comparison. We first demonstrate the capabilities of the method by
applying it to realistic simulated SNIa data, based on the real 3-year data
release from the Supernova Legacy Survey (SNLS3). Assuming typical values for
the halo parameters in our simulations, we find that a catalogue analogous to
the existing SNLS3 data set is incapable of detecting the lensing signal, but a
catalogue containing approximately three times as many SNIa does produce robust
and accurate parameter constraints and model selection results for two halo
models: a truncated singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and a
Navarro--Frenk--White (NFW) profile, thereby validating our analysis
methodology. In the analysis of the real SNLS3 data, contrary to previous
studies, we obtain only a very marginal detection of a lensing signal and weak
constraints on the halo parameters for the truncated SIS model, although these
constraints are tighter than those obtained from the equivalent simulated SNIa
data set. This difference is driven by a preferred value of $\eta \approx 1$ in
the assumed scaling-law $\sigma \propto L^\eta$ between velocity dispersion and
luminosity, which is somewhat higher than the canonical values of $\eta =
\tfrac{1}{4}$ and $\eta = \tfrac{1}{3}$ for early and late-type galaxies,
respectively, and leads to a stronger lensing effect by the halo. No detection
of a lensing signal is made for the NFW model.

placed on the shells of the spheres, in the form of randomly located halos,
modeled with Navarro-Frenk-White profiles. The remaining mass is placed in the
interior of the spheres, either smoothly distributed, or as randomly located
halos. We compute the distribution of magnitude shifts using a variant of the
method of Holz & Wald (1998), which includes the effect of lensing shear. In
the two models we consider, the standard deviation of this distribution is
0.065 and 0.072 magnitudes and the mean is -0.0010 and -0.0013 magnitudes, for
voids of radius 35 Mpc, sources at redshift 1.5, with the voids chosen so that
90% of the mass is on the shell today. The standard deviation due to voids and
halos is a factor ~ 3 larger than that due to 35 Mpc voids alone with a 1 Mpc
shell thickness which we studied in our previous work. To a good approximation,
the variance of the distribution depends only on the mean column depth and
concentration of halos and on the fraction of the mass density that is in the
form of halos (as opposed to smoothly distributed): it is independent of how
the halos are distributed in space. We derive an approximate analytic formula
for the variance that agrees with our numerical results to \lesssim 20% out to

  parametrization. Recent references added",,"10.1103/PhysRevD.86.096005",,"hep-ph nucl-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the simplest versions of the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and
the Linear Sigma Model (LSM), in the Mean Field Approximation (MFA), in order
to analyze hot and dense two flavor quark matter subject to strong magnetic
fields. We pay especial attention to the case of a finite chemical potential,
which has not yet been fully explored. Our results, for the NJL model, are in
qualitative agreement with other recent applications showing that, for stronger
fields, the first order segment of the transition line increases with the
magnetic strength while the coexistence chemical potential value, at low
temperatures, decreases. In the present work, one of the most important results
is related to the analysis of how these features affect the phase coexistence
region in the $T-\rho_B$ plane. We find that the coexistence boundary
oscillates around the B=0 value for magnetic fields of the order $eB \lesssim
9.5\, m_\pi^2$ which can be understood by investigating the filling of Landau
levels at vanishing temperature. So far, most investigations have been
concerned with the effects of the magnetic field over the $T-\mu$ plane only
while other thermodynamical quantities such as the adiabats, the quark number
susceptibility, the interaction measure and the latent heat have been
neglected. Here, we take a step towards filling this gap by investigating the
influence of a magnetic field over these quantities. Finally, we argue that a
naive application of the MFA does not seem to be appropriate to treat the LSM
in the presence of magnetic fields.

  Jordanie (2011)",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The selection of the best classification algorithm for a given dataset is a
very widespread problem. It is also a complex one, in the sense it requires to
make several important methodological choices. Among them, in this work we
focus on the measure used to assess the classification performance and rank the
algorithms. We present the most popular measures and discuss their properties.
Despite the numerous measures proposed over the years, many of them turn out to
be equivalent in this specific case, to have interpretation problems, or to be
unsuitable for our purpose. Consequently, classic overall success rate or
marginal rates should be preferred for this specific task.

radiation reaction of point charged particles in linear classical
electrodynamics, a theory of generalized higher order tensors and differential
forms is introduced. The generalization of some fundamental notions of the
differential geometry and the theory of differential forms is presented. In
particular, the cohomology and integration theories for generalized higher
order forms are developed, including the Cartan calculus, a generalization of
de Rham cohomology and a version of Thom's isomorphism theorem. We consider in
detail a special type of generalized higher order tensors associated with
bounded maximal $n$-acceleration and use it as a model of spacetime. A
generalization of electrodynamic theory with higher order fields is introduced.
We show that combining the generalized higher order fields with maximal
acceleration geometry the evolution of a point charged particle interacting
with the generalized higher order fields can be described by solutions of an
implicit second order ordinary differential equation. In flat space such
equation is Lorentz invariant, does not have pre-accelerated solutions of
Dirac's type or run-away solutions, it is compatible with Newton's first law of
dynamics and with the covariant Larmor's power radiation law. A generalization
of the Maxwell-Lorentz theory is also introduced. The theory is linear in the
field sector and it reduces to the standard Maxwell-Lorentz electrodynamics
when the maximal acceleration is infinite. Finally, we discuss the assumptions
of our framework in addition to some predictions of the theory.

perturbations induced by uncompensated sensor motion and /or unknown
propagation effects caused by turbulent media. To get refocused images,
autofocus proves to be useful post-processing technique applied to estimate and
compensate the unknown phase errors. However, a severe drawback of the
conventional autofocus algorithms is that they are only capable of removing
one-dimensional azimuth phase errors (APE). As the resolution becomes finer,
residual range cell migration (RCM), which makes the defocus inherently
two-dimensional, becomes a new challenge. In this paper, correction of APE and
residual RCM are presented in the framework of polar format algorithm (PFA).
First, an insight into the underlying mathematical mechanism of polar
reformatting is presented. Then based on this new formulation, the effect of
polar reformatting on the uncompensated APE and residual RCM is investigated in
detail. By using the derived analytical relationship between APE and residual
RCM, an efficient two-dimensional (2-D) autofocus method is proposed.
Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
