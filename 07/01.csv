cryptographic protocols, such as those for secure multiparty-computation and
key management. These protocols typically assume the presence of direct
communication links from the dealer to all participants, in which case the
dealer can directly pass the shares of the secret to each participant. In this
paper, we consider the problem of secret sharing when the dealer does not have
direct communication links to all the participants, and instead, the dealer and
the participants form a general network. Existing methods are based on secure
message transmissions from the dealer to each participant requiring
considerable coordination in the network. In this paper, we present a
distributed algorithm for disseminating shares over a network, which we call
the SNEAK algorithm, requiring each node to know only the identities of its
one-hop neighbours. While SNEAK imposes a stronger condition on the network by
requiring the dealer to be what we call k-propagating rather than k-connected
as required by the existing solutions, we show that in addition to being
distributed, SNEAK achieves significant reduction in the communication cost and
the amount of randomness required.

be ruled by a novel, frequency-dependent function which we call Wave Potential,

exact, Hamiltonian, ray-based kinematical treatment, reducing to the usual
eikonal approximation in the absence of Wave Potential, shows that its presence
induces a mutual, perpendicular ray-coupling, which is the one and only cause
of wave-like phenomena such as diffraction and interference. The Wave
Potential, whose discovery does already constitute a striking novelty in the
case of classical waves, turns out to play an even more important role in the
quantum case. Recalling, indeed, that the time-independent Schroedinger
equation (associating the motion of mono-energetic particles with stationary
monochromatic matter waves) is itself a Helmholtz-like equation, the exact,
ray-based treatment developed in the classical case is extended - without
resorting to statistical concepts - to the exact, trajectory-based Hamiltonian
dynamics of mono-energetic point-like particles. Exact, classical-looking
particle trajectories may be defined, contrary to common belief, and turn out
to be perpendicularly coupled by an exact, energy-dependent Wave Potential,
similar in the form, but not in the physical meaning, to the statistical,
energy-independent ""Quantum Potential"" of Bohm's theory, which is affected, as
is well known, by the practical necessity of representing particles by means of
statistical wave packets, moving along probability flux lines. This result,

Uncertainty Principle, allows a novel, non-probabilistic interpretation of Wave

become extremely successful. As a consequence, more and more data has been
added to the data warehouses and their schemas have become increasingly
complex. These systems still work great in order to generate pre-canned
reports. However, with their current complexity, they tend to be a poor match
for non tech-savvy business analysts who need answers to ad-hoc queries that
were not anticipated. This paper describes the design, implementation, and
experience of the SODA system (Search over DAta Warehouse). SODA bridges the
gap between the business needs of analysts and the technical complexity of
current data warehouses. SODA enables a Google-like search experience for data
warehouses by taking keyword queries of business users and automatically
generating executable SQL. The key idea is to use a graph pattern matching
algorithm that uses the metadata model of the data warehouse. Our results with
real data from a global player in the financial services industry show that
SODA produces queries with high precision and recall, and makes it much easier
for business users to interactively explore highly-complex data warehouses.

web search query logs contain millions of query terms which cannot be
categorized as sensitive or non-sensitive since a term may be sensitive for a
user and non-sensitive for another. Motivated by this observation, we propose
an anonymization technique termed disassociation that preserves the original

participate in identifying combinations. This way the adversary cannot
associate with high probability a record with a rare combination of terms. To

combination of taxonomies and latent factor models to mitigate these issues and
improve recommendation accuracy. We observe that taxonomies provide structure
similar to that of a latent factor model: namely, it imposes human-labeled
categories (clusters) over items. This leads to our proposed taxonomy-aware
latent factor model (TF) which combines taxonomies and latent factors using
additive models. We develop efficient algorithms to train the TF models, which
scales to large number of users/items and develop scalable

information, for example, about emerging events. Existing techniques for
discovering such events from a microblog stream in real time (such as Twitter
trending topics), have several lacunae when used for discovering emerging
events; extant graph based event detection techniques are not practical in
microblog settings due to their complexity; and conventional techniques, which
have been developed for blogs, web-pages, etc., involving the use of keyword
search, are only useful for finding information about known events. Hence, in
this paper, we present techniques to discover events that are unraveling in
microblog message streams in real time so that such events can be reported as
soon as they occur. We model the problem as discovering dense clusters in
highly dynamic graphs. Despite many recent advances in graph analysis, ours is
the first technique to identify dense clusters in massive and highly dynamic
graphs in real time. Given the characteristics of microblog streams, in order
to find clusters without missing any events, we propose and exploit a novel
graph property which we call short-cycle property. Our algorithms find these
clusters efficiently in spite of rapid changes to the microblog streams.
Further we present a novel ranking function to identify the important events.
Besides proving the correctness of our algorithms we show their practical
utility by evaluating them using real world microblog data. These demonstrate
our technique's ability to discover, with high precision and recall, emerging
events in high intensity data streams in real time. Many recent web

events is deemed to be statistically significant if it is unlikely to have
occurred due to randomness or chance alone. We use the chi-square statistic as
a quantitative measure of statistical significance. Given a string of
characters generated from a memoryless Bernoulli model, the problem is to
identify the substring for which the empirical distribution of single letters
deviates the most from the distribution expected from the generative Bernoulli
model. This deviation is captured using the chi-square measure. The most
significant substring (MSS) of a string is thus defined as the substring having
the highest chi-square value. Till date, to the best of our knowledge, there
does not exist any algorithm to find the MSS in better than O(n^2) time, where
n denotes the length of the string. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to

probability. We also study some variants of this problem such as finding the
top-t set, finding all substrings having chi-square greater than a fixed
threshold and finding the MSS among substrings greater than a given length. We
experimentally demonstrate the asymptotic behavior of the MSS on varying the
string size and alphabet size. We also describe some applications of our

Contrary to classical sort-merge joins, our MPSM algorithms do not rely on a
hard to parallelize final merge step to create one complete sort order. Rather
they work on the independently created runs in parallel. This way our MPSM
algorithms are NUMA-affine as all the sorting is carried out on local memory
partitions. An extensive experimental evaluation on a modern 32-core machine
with one TB of main memory proves the competitive performance of MPSM on large
main memory databases with billions of objects. It scales (almost) linearly in

the blocking of gas diffusion by Plateau borders inflated with liquid. By

in the various coupling schemes. The dual pairing of group representations has
been applied profitably in mathematics to the study of invariant theory. We
show that parallel applications to the theory of symmetry and dynamical groups

representations of a discrete group with those of a continuous Lie group or
those of a compact Lie with those of a non-compact Lie group makes it possible
to infer many properties of difficult groups from those of simpler groups. This

computational techniques for solving problems that arise in applications of
symmetry methods in physics and which result from the famous Schur-Weyl duality

  via Mini-Slot Access",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The high bandwidth demand of Internet applications has recently driven the
need of increasing the residential download speed. A practical solution to the
problem has been proposed aggregating the bandwidth of 802.11 Access Points
(APs) backhauls in range via 802.11 connections. Since 802.11 devices are
usually single-radio, the communication to multiple APs on different
radio-channels requires the introduction of a time-division multiple access
(TDMA) policy at the client station. Current investigation in this area
supposes that there is a sufficient number of TCP flows to saturate the
Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) behind the APs. However, this may be
not guaranteed according to the user traffic pattern. As a consequence, a TDMA
policy introduces additional delays in the end-to-end transmissions that will
cause degradation of the TCP throughput and an under-utilization of the AP
backhauls. In this paper, we first perform an in-depth experimental analysis
with a customized 802.11 driver of how the usage of multi-AP TDMA affects the
observed Round-Trip-Time (RTT) of TCP flows. Then, we introduce a simple
analytical model that accurately predicts the TCP RTT when accessing the
wireless medium with a Multi-AP TDMA policy. Based on this model, we propose a
resource allocation algorithm that runs locally at the station and it greatly
reduces the observed TCP RTT with a very low computational cost. Our proposed
scheme can improve up to 1:5 times the aggregate throughput observed by the
station compared to state-of-the-art multi-AP TDMA allocations. We also show
that the throughput performance of the algorithm is very close to the
theoretical upper-bound in key simulation scenarios.

solution strategy for solving the discrete eigenvalue problem by using spectral
finite-elements in conjunction with Gauss-Lobatto quadrature, and a Chebyshev
acceleration technique for computing the occupied eigenspace. The proposed
approach has been observed to provide a staggering 100-200 fold computational
advantage over the solution of a generalized eigenvalue problem. Using the
proposed solution procedure, we investigate the computational efficiency
afforded by higher-order finite-element discretization of the Kohn-Sham DFT
problem. Our studies suggest that staggering computational savings of the order
of 1000 fold relative to linear finite-elements can be realized, for both
all-electron and local pseudopotential calculations. On all the benchmark
systems studied, we observe diminishing returns in computational savings beyond
the sixth-order for accuracies commensurate with chemical accuracy. A
comparative study of the computational efficiency of the proposed higher-order
finite-element discretizations suggests that the performance of finite-element
basis is competing with the plane-wave discretization for non-periodic local
pseudopotential calculations, and compares to the Gaussian basis for
all-electron calculations within an order of magnitude. Further, we demonstrate
the capability of the proposed approach to compute the electronic structure of
a metallic system containing 1688 atoms using modest computational resources,

from Principal Component Analysis of morphological, physical and photometric
galaxy properties. Thus, galaxies can be labeled, ranked and classified by a
single arc length value of the curve, measured at the unique closest projection
of the data points on the P-curve. We find that the P-curve has a ""W"" letter
shape with 3 turning points, defining 4 branches that represent distinct galaxy
populations. This behavior is controlled mainly by 2 properties, namely u-r and
SFR. We further present the variations of several galaxy properties as a
function of arc length. Luminosity functions variate from steep Schechter fits
at low arc length, to double power law and ending in Log-normal fits at high
arc length. Galaxy clustering shows increasing autocorrelation power at large
scales as arc length increases. PCA analysis allowed to find peculiar galaxy
populations located apart from the main cloud of data points, such as small red
galaxies dominated by a disk, of relatively high stellar mass-to-light ratio
and surface mass density. The P-curve allows not only dimensionality reduction,
but also provides supporting evidence for relevant physical models and
scenarios in extragalactic astronomy: 1) Evidence for the hierarchical merging
scenario in the formation of a selected group of red massive galaxies. These
galaxies present a log-normal r-band luminosity function, which might arise
from multiplicative processes involved in this scenario. 2) Connection between
the onset of AGN activity and star formation quenching, which appears in green
galaxies when transitioning from blue to red populations. (Full abstract in

k2=(1/2,-1/2,0), result in domains of two symmetry-related G-type
antiferromagnetic structures, noted A and B, respectively. These domains are
approximately 0.02 mm^2 and are independent of the thermal history. An
understanding of this key aspect of the magnetism is necessary for an overall
picture of the magnetic behaviour in this compound. Azimuthal and polarisation
dependence of magnetic reflections, relating to both magnetic wave vectors,
show that the Ir magnetic moments in the bilayer compound are oriented along
the c axis. This contrasts with single layer Sr2IrO4 where the moments are
confined to the ab plane.

over the Rayleigh number range $6\times10^5\lesssim Ra\lesssim10^{11}$ and the
Prandtl number range $5.2\lesssim Pr\lesssim7$. Our results show that for
rectangular geometry turbulent heat transport is independent of the cells'
aspect ratios and hence is insensitive to the nature and structures of the
large-scale mean flows of the system. This is slightly different from the
observations in cylindrical cells where $Nu$ is found to be in general a
decreasing function of $\Gamma$, at least for $\Gamma=1$ and larger. Such a
difference is probably a manifestation of the finite plate conductivity effect.
Corrections for the influence of the finite conductivity of the top and bottom
plates are made to obtain the estimates of $Nu_{\infty}$ for plates with
perfect conductivity. The local scaling exponents $\beta_l$ of $Nu_{\infty}\sim
Ra^{\beta_l}$ are calculated and found to increase from 0.243 at

low-level activities down to log R' ~ -5.4 (R' is the ratio of the

position-dependent as ~ +400 m/s near the disk center and increasing toward the

Interestingly, this trend tends to disappear when the convectiveshift due to
granular motions (~-300 m/s at the disk center and increasing toward the limb;
simulated based on the two-component model along with the empirical
center-to-limb variation) is subtracted, finally resulting in the averaged

similarities between quantum tomography and the tomography of a classical die
motivated us to apply a simple modification of the classical estimator for use
in the quantum problem. This worked very well. In this article, we adapt a
different aspect of the classical estimator to the quantum problem. In
particular, we investigate the mean estimator, where the mean is taken with a
weight function identical to that in the classical estimator but now with
quantum constraints imposed. Among such mean estimators, we choose an optimal
one with the smallest worst-case error-the minimax mean estimator-and compare
its performance with that of other estimators. Despite the natural
generalization of the classical approach, this minimax mean estimator does not
work as well as one might expect from the analogous performance in the
classical problem. While it outperforms the often-used maximum-likelihood
estimator in having a smaller worst-case error, the advantage is not
significant enough to justify the more complicated procedure required to
construct it. The much simpler adapted estimator introduced in our earlier work
is still more effective. Our previous work emphasized the similarities between
classical and quantum state estimation; in contrast, this paper highlights how
intuition gained from classical problems can sometimes fail in the quantum
arena.

these functions, and formulas due to Fadin, Lipatov and Prygarin, we determine
the six-gluon MHV remainder function in the leading-logarithmic approximation
(LLA) in this limit through ten loops, and the next-to-LLA (NLLA) terms through
nine loops. In separate work, we have determined the symbol of the four-loop

factorizes in the variables (\nu,n) which are related to (w,w*) by a

the adjoint representation to NNLLA accuracy, and the MHV product of impact
factors to NNNLLA accuracy, up to constants representing beyond-the-symbol

us to classify various geometric structures on semisimple symmetric spaces.
Then we investigate the case of symmetric parabolic geometries in detail and
obtain classification of symmetric AHS-structures and symmetric parabolic
contact geometries in the semisimple cases.

binary BD+36 3317 which is known as a member of Delta Lyrae (Stephenson 1)
cluster. We determined colors and brightness of the system, calculated E(B - V)
color excess. We discovered that the system shows total eclipse in secondary
minimum. Using this advantage, we found that the primary component of the
system has B9 - A0 spectral type. Although there is no published orbital
solution, we tried to estimate the physical properties of the system from
simultaneous analysis of UBV light curves with 2003 version of Wilson-Devinney
code. Then we considered photometric solution results together with
evolutionary models and estimated the masses of the components as M1 = 2.5 Msun
and M2 = 1.6 Msun. Those estimations gave the distance of the system as 353 pc.
Considering the uncertainties in distance estimation, resulting distance is in
agreement with the distance of Delta Lyrae cluster.

inefficient in most previous quasar surveys as their optical colors are similar
to those of stars. The near-IR K-band excess technique has been suggested to
overcome this difficulty. Our study also proposed to use optical/near-IR colors
for selecting z<4 quasars. To this method, we selected 105 unidentified bright
targets with i<18.5 from the quasar candidates of SDSS DR6 with both SDSS ugriz
optical and UKIDSS YJHK near-IR photometric data, which satisfy our proposed
Y-K/g-z criterion and have photometric redshifts between 2.2 and 3.5 estimated
from the 9-band SDSS-UKIDSS data. 43 of them were observed with the 2.16m
telescope of NAOC in 2012. 36 of them were identified as quasars at 2.1<z<3.4.
High success rate of discovering these quasars in the SDSS spectroscopic
surveyed area demonstrates the robustness of both the Y-K/g-z selection
criterion and the photometric redshift estimation technique. We also used the
above criterion to investigate the possible star contamination rate to the
quasar candidates of SDSS DR6, and found that it is much higher in selecting
3<z<3.5 quasar candidates than selecting lower redshift ones (z<2.2). The
significant improvement in the photometric redshift estimation by using the
9-band SDSS-UKIDSS data than using the 5-band SDSS data is demonstrated and a
catalog of 7,727 unidentified quasar candidates with photometric redshifts
between 2.2 and 3.5 is provided. We also tested the Y-K/g-z selection criterion
with the SDSS-III/DR9 quasar catalog, and found 96.2% of 17,999 DR9 quasars
with UKIDSS Y and K-band data satisfy our criterion. With some samples of red
and type II quasars, we found that 88% and 96.5% of them can be selected by the
Y-K/g-z criterion respectively, which supports that using the Y-K/g-z criterion
we can efficiently select both unobscured and obscured quasars. (abridged)

A-level revision lesson on mechanics. The context of the problem involved the
motion of a ball thrown vertically upwards in air and studying how the
associated physical quantities changed during its flight. Different groups of
students were assigned to look at the ball's motion using various
representations: motion diagrams, vector diagrams, free-body diagrams, verbal
description, equations and graphs, drawn against time as well as against
displacement. Overall, feedback from students about the lesson was positive. We
further discuss the benefits of using computer simulation to support and extend
student learning.

  Conference 01-03 June 2009, Singapore . http://conference.nie.edu.sg/2009/",,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  This paper highlights the diverse possibilities in the rich community of
educators from the Conceptual Learning of Science (CoLoS) and Open Source
Physics (OSP) movement to engage, enable and empower educators and students, to
create interactive digital media through computer modeling. This concept
revolves around a paradigmatic shift towards participatory learning through
immersive computer modeling, as opposed to using technology for information
transmission. We aim to engage high school educators to professionally develop
themselves by creating and customizing simulations possible through Easy Java
Simulation (Ejs) and its learning community. Ejs allows educators to be
designers of learning environments through modifying source codes of the
simulation. Educators can conduct lessons with students' using these
interactive digital simulations and rapidly enhance the simulation through
changing the source codes personally. Ejs toolkit, its library of simulations
and growing community contributed simulation codes, in a Web 2.0 environment,
potentially allows for rapid proliferation of mass customized virtual
laboratories simulation with educators as designers of learning environment.
Our journey of remixing this simulation created an educator customized
interactive digital media virtual laboratory for advancing learning physics by
inquiry. The process of creating a simulation also has desirable pedagogical
value that will be challenging to bring to high school students to learn by
modeling.The impediments to using this method are discussed.

of holomorphic functions on coverings of Stein manifolds (such as algebras of
Bohr's holomorphic almost periodic functions on tube domains or algebras of all
fibrewise bounded holomorphic functions arising, e.g., in the corona problem
for $H^\infty$). In particular, in this context we obtain results on
holomorphic extension from complex submanifolds, properties of divisors, corona
type theorems, holomorphic analogues of the Peter-Weyl approximation theorem,
Hartogs type theorems, characterizations of uniqueness sets, etc.
  Our proofs are based on analogues of Cartan theorems A and B for coherent
type sheaves on maximal ideal spaces of these algebras proved in Part I.

propagators and the ghost-gluon vertex of Landau-gauge gluodynamics in two
dimensions. While this simplifies some aspects of the calculations as compared
to three and four dimensions, new complications arise due to a mixing of
different momentum regimes. As a result, the solutions for the propagators are
more sensitive to changes in the three-point functions and the ansaetze used
for them at the leading order in a vertex a expansion. Here, we therefore go
beyond this common truncation by including the ghost-gluon vertex
self-consistently for the first time, while using a model for the three-gluon
vertex which reproduces the known infrared asymptotics and the zeros at
intermediate momenta as observed on the lattice. A separate computation of the
three-gluon vertex from the results is used to confirm the stability of this
behavior a posteriori. We also present further arguments for the absence of the
decoupling solution in two dimensions. Finally, we show how in general the
infrared exponent kappa of the scaling solutions in two, three and four
dimensions can be changed by allowing an angle dependence and thus an essential
singularity of the ghost-gluon vertex in the infrared.
