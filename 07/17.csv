to a massive complex scalar field with a harmonic dependence on time and the

very dilute systems. While a simple Wigner crystal becomes energetically
favorable compared to the Laughlin liquid for filling fractions $\nu<1/12$, a
correlated crystal of composite particles emerges already for $\nu \leq 1/6$
with a large energy gap to the simple Wigner crystal. The presence of a new

the horizon. This is in contrast with the prediction of the thin-wall

gravitational microlensing has accumulated tens of TBytes of data and developed
into a powerful astrophysical technique with diverse applications. The review
starts with a theoretical overview of the field and then proceeds to discuss
the scientific highlights. (1) Microlensing observations toward the Magellanic
Clouds rule out the Milky Way halo being dominated by MAssive Compact Halo
Objects (MACHOs). This confirms most dark matter is non-baryonic, consistent
with other observations. (2) Microlensing has discovered about 20 extrasolar
planets (16 published), including the first two Jupiter-Saturn like systems and
the only ""cold Neptunes"" yet detected. They probe a different part of the
parameter space and will likely provide the most stringent test of core
accretion theory of planet formation. (3) Microlensing provides a unique way to
measure the mass of isolated stars, including brown dwarfs to normal stars.
Half a dozen or so stellar mass black hole candidates have also been proposed.
(4) High-resolution, target-of-opportunity spectra of highly-magnified dwarf
stars provide intriguing ""age"" determinations which may either hint at enhanced
helium enrichment or unusual bulge formation theories. (5) Microlensing also
measured limb-darkening profiles for close to ten giant stars, which challenges
stellar atmosphere models. (6) Data from surveys also provide strong
constraints on the geometry and kinematics of the Milky Way bar (through proper
motions); the latter indicates predictions from current models appear to be too
anisotropic compared with observations. The future of microlensing is bright
given the new capabilities of current surveys and forthcoming new telescope
networks from the ground and from space. Some open issues in the field are
identified and briefly discussed.

potential associated with the Higgs fields involved in the spontaneous GUT
symmetry breaking, in the presence of a non-minimal coupling of the inflaton
field to gravity. The inflationary model relies on renormalizable
superpotential terms and does not lead to overproduction of magnetic monopoles.
It is largely independent of one-loop radiative corrections, and it can be
consistent with current observational data on the inflationary observables,
with the GUT symmetry breaking scale assuming its SUSY value. Non-thermal
leptogenesis is realized by the out-of-equilibrium decay of the two lightest
right-handed (RH) neutrinos, which are produced by the inflaton decay.
Confronting our scenario with the current observational data on light
neutrinos, the GUT prediction for the heaviest Dirac neutrino mass, the baryon
asymmetry of the universe and the gravitino limit on the reheating temperature,
we constrain the masses of the RH neutrinos in the range (10^10-10^15) GeV and

However,
conservation laws are not applicable to open systems that undergo irreversible
transformations. More general selection rules are needed to determine whether,
given two states, the transition from one state to the other is possible. The
usual approach to the problem of finding such rules relies heavily on group
theory and involves a detailed study of the structure of the respective
symmetry group. We approach the problem in a completely new way by using
entanglement to investigate the asymmetry properties of quantum states. To this
end, we embed the space state of the system in a tensor product Hilbert space,
whereby symmetric transformations between two states are replaced with local
operations on their bipartite images.The embedding enables us to use the
well-studied theory of entanglement to investigate the consequences of dynamic
symmetries. Moreover, under reversible transformations, the entanglement of the
bipartite image states becomes a conserved quantity. These entanglement-based
conserved quantities are new and different from the conserved quantities based
on expectation values of the Hamiltonian symmetry generators. Our method is not
group-specific and applies to general symmetries associated with any
semi-simple Lie group.

rationality, human players can take decisions on which strategy to choose in a
game on the basis of simple opinions. These opinions can be modified after each
round by observing own or others payoff results but can be also modified after
interchanging impressions with other players. In this way, the update of the
strategies can become a question that goes beyond simple evolutionary rules
based on fitness and become a social issue. In this work, we explore this
scenario by coupling a game with an opinion dynamics model. The opinion is
represented by a continuous variable that corresponds to the certainty of the
agents respect to which strategy is best. The opinions transform into actions
by making the selection of an strategy a stochastic event with a probability
regulated by the opinion. A certain regard for the previous round payoff is
included but the main update rules of the opinion are given by a model inspired
in social interchanges. We find that the dynamics fixed points of the coupled
model is different from those of the evolutionary game or the opinion models
alone. Furthermore, new features emerge such as the resilience of the fraction
of cooperators to the topology of the social interaction network or to the
presence of a small fraction of extremist players.

the accretion disk - such as its mass accretion rate, inner radius, and
emergent magnetic field - should drive and modulate the production of
relativistic jets. Stellar-mass black holes in the ""low/hard"" state are an
excellent laboratory in which to study disk-jet connections, but few
coordinated observations are made using spectrometers that can incisively probe
the inner disk. We report on a series of 20 Suzaku observations of Cygnus X-1
made in the jet-producing low/hard state. Contemporaneous radio monitoring was
done using the Arcminute MicroKelvin Array radio telescope. Two important and
simple results are obtained: (1) the jet (as traced by radio flux) does not
appear to be modulated by changes in the inner radius of the accretion disk;
and (2) the jet is sensitive to disk properties, including its flux,
temperature, and ionization. Some more complex results may reveal aspects of a
coupled disk-corona-jet system. A positive correlation between the reflected
X-ray flux and radio flux may represent specific support for a plasma ejection
model of the corona, wherein the base of a jet produces hard X-ray emission.
Within the framework of the plasma ejection model, the spectra suggest a jet
base with v/c ~ 0.3, or the escape velocity for a vertical height of z ~ 20
GM/c^2 above the black hole. The detailed results of X-ray disk continuum and
reflection modeling also suggest a height of z ~ 20 GM/c^2 for hard X-ray
production above a black hole, with a spin in the range 0.6 < a < 0.99. This
height agrees with X-ray time lags recently found in Cygnus X-1. The overall
picture that emerges from this study is broadly consistent with some
jet-focused models for black hole spectral energy distributions in which a
relativistic plasma is accelerated at z = 10-100 GM/c^2.

in the affirmative some recent conjectures concerning pattern avoidance for
ascent sequences. Given a pattern $\tau$, let $\mathcal{S}_\tau(n)$ denote the

of the existence and stability of spatially periodic waves for the ""good""
Boussinesq equation. In the analysis our instability index theory provides an
explicit, and somewhat surprising, connection between the stability of a given

with high accuracy the experimental results for suspensions of star polymers in

observed in the case of diblock copolymer stars suggesting that the reason for
this peculiar behavior is mainly a consequence of the softness of the

fainter than ever before seen in this source) and long duration (~3 times
longer than a typical low/hard state excursion). During this event little to no
source variability is observed on timescales of ~hours-weeks, and the X-ray
spectrum implies an upper limit of 1.2x10^35 erg s^-1. Five years later another
extended low state occurs, lasting from 2008 December 11 until 2009 June 17.
This event lasts nearly twice as long as the first, and while significant
variability is observed, the source remains reliably in the low/hard spectral
state for the ~188 day duration. These episodes share some characteristics with
the ""anomalous low states"" in the neutron star binary Her X-1. The average
period and amplitude of the variability of LMC X-3 have different values
between these episodes. We characterize the long-term variability of LMC X-3
before and after the two events using conventional and nonlinear time series
analysis methods, and show that, as is the case in Her X-1, the characteristic
amplitude of the variability is related to its characteristic timescale.
Furthermore, the relation is in the same direction in both systems. This
suggests that a similar mechanism gives rise to the long-term variability,
which in the case of Her X-1 is reliably modeled with a tilted, warped
precessing accretion disk.

the cold molecular gas mass with the UV-derived star formation rate and the

fully accounted for and in good agreement with the cooling byproducts over

the predicted lensing signal increases with increasing \Om or \sig8, with mild
additional dependence on the assumed scatter between richness and mass. The

measurements on small scales (R<=2\hmpc). The (\Om,\sig8) constraint is
consistent with and orthogonal to the one inferred from WMAP CMB data,
reflecting agreement with the structure growth predicted by GR for an LCDM

gravitational lens SL2SJ02176-0513, a cusp arc at z=1.847. The UV continuum of
the lensed galaxy is very blue, which is seemingly at odds with its redder
optical colors. The 3D-HST WFC3/G141 near-infrared spectrum of the lens reveals
the source of this discrepancy to be extremely strong [OIII]5007 and H-beta
emission lines with rest-frame equivalent widths of 2000 +/- 100 and 520 +/- 40
Angstroms, respectively. The source has a stellar mass ~10^8 Msun, sSFR \sim
100/Gyr, and detection of [OIII]4363 yields a metallicity of 12 + log(O/H) =
7.5 +/- 0.2. We identify local blue compact dwarf analogs to SL2SJ02176-0513,
which are among the most metal-poor galaxies in the SDSS. The local analogs
resemble the lensed galaxy in many ways, including UV/optical SED, spatial
morphology and emission line equivalent widths and ratios. Common to
SL2SJ02176-0513 and its local counterparts is an upturn at mid-IR wavelengths
likely arising from hot dust heated by starbursts. The emission lines of
SL2SJ02176-0513 are spatially resolved owing to the combination of the lens and
the high spatial resolution of HST. The lensed galaxy is composed of two clumps
with combined size r_e \sim 300 pc, and we resolve significant differences in
UV color and emission line equivalent width between them. Though it has
characteristics occasionally attributed to active galactic nuclei, we conclude
that SL2SJ02176-0513 is a low-metallicity star-bursting dwarf galaxy. Such
galaxies will be found in significant numbers in the full 3D-HST grism survey.

accreting neutron stars as day-long X-ray flares called superbursts. In the few
cases where the onset is observed, superbursts exhibit a short precursor burst
at the start. In each instance, however, the data was of insufficient quality
for spectral analysis of the precursor. Using data from the propane
anti-coincidence detector of the PCA instrument on RXTE, we perform the first
detailed time resolved spectroscopy of precursors. For a superburst from 4U
1820-30 we demonstrate the presence of photospheric radius expansion. We find
the precursor to be 1.4-2 times more energetic than other short bursts from
this source, indicating that the burning of accreted helium is insufficient to
explain the full precursor. Shock heating would be able to account for the
lacking energy. We argue that this precursor is a strong indication that the
superburst starts as a detonation, and that a shock induces the precursor.
Furthermore, we employ our technique to study the superexpansion phase of the
same superburst in greater detail.

stream or a new stream in the MW disk. Comparison to various Galactic models
suggests that these high RVs are best explained by stars in orbits of the
Galactic bar potential, although some observational features remain

single parent body, or spin-up and rotational fission of a rubble-pile. Aside
from detailed dynamical analyses and measurement of rotational light curves,
little work has been done to investigate the colors or spectra of these unusual
objects. A photometric and spectroscopic survey was conducted to determine the
reflectance properties of asteroid pairs. New observations were obtained for a
total of 34 individual asteroids. Additional photometric measurements were
retrieved from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Moving Object Catalog. Colors or
spectra for a total of 42 pair components are presented here. The main findings
of this work are: (1) the components in the observed pair systems have the same
colors within the uncertainties of this survey, and (2) the color distribution
of asteroid pairs appears indistinguishable from that of all Main Belt
asteroids. These findings support a scenario of pair formation from a common
progenitor and suggest that pair formation is likely a compositionally
independent process. In agreement with previous studies, this is most
consistent with an origin via binary disruption and/or rotational fission.

although errors are large, there is an indication of a 2.6 times increase of

(BHs), with NS formation typically occurring at the low mass end and collapse
to a BH more likely at the high mass end. In an intermediate regime, with a
mass range that depends on the uncertain details of rotation and mass loss
during the star's life, a NS is initially formed which then experiences
fallback accretion and collapse to a BH. The electromagnetic consequence of
such an event is not clear. Depending on the progenitor's structure,
possibilities range from a long gamma-ray burst to a Type II supernova (that
may or may not be jet-powered) to a collapse with a weak electromagnetic
signature. Gravitational waves (GWs) provide the exciting opportunity to peer
through the envelope of a dying massive star and directly probe what is
occurring inside. We explore whether fallback onto young NSs can be detected by
ground-based interferometers. When the incoming material has sufficient angular
momentum to form a disk, the accretion spins up the NS sufficiently to produce
non-axisymmetric instabilities and gravitational radiation at frequencies of
~700-2400 Hz for ~30-3000 s until collapse to a BH occurs. Using a realistic
excess cross-power search algorithm, we show that such events are detectable by
Advanced LIGO out to ~17 Mpc. From the rate of nearby core-collapse supernovae,
we estimate that there will be ~1-2 events each year that are worth checking
for fallback GWs. The observation of these unique GW signatures coincident with
electromagnetic detections would identify the transient events that are
associated with this channel of BH formation, while providing information about

high-latitude displacements align themselves with the observed surfaces of
constant angular velocity. The tendency for the angular velocity to remain
constant with depth in the bulk of the convective zone, together with other
critical features of the rotation profile, emerge from little more than a
visual inspection of the governing equation. In the absence of a background

suggesting that solar convection ""plays-off"" of prexisting shear rather than
creates it. We argue that baroclinic vorticity of precisely the right order is

distortion of equipotential surfaces that is not precisely followed by
isothermal surfaces. If so, many features of the Sun's internal rotation become
more clear, including: i) the general appearance of the tachocline; ii) the

galaxies from a hot corona of gas, using a new smoothed particle hydrodynamics
code, 'SPHS'. We find that the 'cold clumps' seen in many classic SPH
simulations in the literature are not present in our SPHS simulations. Instead,
cold gas condenses from the halo along filaments that form at the intersection
of supernovae-driven bubbles from previous phases of star formation. This
positive feedback feeds cold gas to the galactic disc directly, fuelling
further star formation. The resulting galaxies in the SPH and SPHS simulations
differ greatly in their morphology, gas phase diagrams, and stellar content. We
show that the classic SPH cold clumps owe to a numerical thermal instability
caused by an inability for cold gas to mix in the hot halo. The improved
treatment of mixing in SPHS suppresses this instability leading to a
dramatically different physical outcome. In our highest resolution SPHS
simulation, we find that the cold filaments break up into bound clumps that
form stars. The filaments are overdense by a factor of 10-100 compared to the
surrounding gas, suggesting that the fragmentation results from a physical
non-linear instability driven by the overdensity. This 'fragmenting filament'
mode of disc growth has important implications for galaxy formation, in
particular the role of star formation in bringing cold gas into disc galaxies.

formed by individual migration, large-scale population movements, and other
demographic events. Population genomics datasets can provide a window into this
recent history, as rare traces of recent shared genetic ancestry are detectable
due to long segments of shared genomic material. We make use of genomic data
for 2,257 Europeans (the POPRES dataset) to conduct one of the first surveys of
recent genealogical ancestry over the past three thousand years at a
continental scale. We detected 1.9 million shared genomic segments, and used
the lengths of these to infer the distribution of shared ancestors across time
and geography. We find that a pair of modern Europeans living in neighboring
populations share around 10-50 genetic common ancestors from the last 1500
years, and upwards of 500 genetic ancestors from the previous 1000 years. These
numbers drop off exponentially with geographic distance, but since genetic
ancestry is rare, individuals from opposite ends of Europe are still expected
to share millions of common genealogical ancestors over the last 1000 years.
There is substantial regional variation in the number of shared genetic
ancestors: especially high numbers of common ancestors between many eastern
populations likely date to the Slavic and/or Hunnic expansions, while much
lower levels of common ancestry in the Italian and Iberian peninsulas may
indicate weaker demographic effects of Germanic expansions into these areas
and/or more stably structured populations. Recent shared ancestry in modern
Europeans is ubiquitous, and clearly shows the impact of both small-scale
migration and large historical events. Population genomic datasets have
considerable power to uncover recent demographic history, and will allow a much
fuller picture of the close genealogical kinship of individuals across the
world.

two-mode Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in highly anisotropic traps. By means
of perturbative techniques, we show that the tightly confined (transverse)
degrees of freedom can be decoupled from the dynamical equations at the expense
of introducing additional effective three-body, attractive, intra- and
inter-mode interactions into the dynamics of the loosely confined
(longitudinal) degrees of freedom. These effective interactions are mediated by
changes in the transverse wave function. The perturbation theory is valid as
long as the nonlinear scattering energy is small compared to the transverse
energy scales. This approach leads to reduced-dimension mean-field equations
that optimally describe the evolution of a two-mode condensate in general
quasi-1D and quasi-2D geometries. We use this model to investigate the relative
phase and density dynamics of a two-mode, cigar-shaped $^{87}$Rb BEC. We study
the relative-phase dynamics in the context of a nonlinear Ramsey interferometry
scheme, which has recently been proposed as a novel platform for high-precision
interferometry. Numerical integration of the coupled, time-dependent,
three-dimensional, two-mode Gross-Pitaevskii equations for various atom numbers

and outside the pulse. By tuning the pulse velocity, an analog black hole
horizon can be obtained in a suitable frequency window. In this paper, we
develop a quantum theory of light propagation for this system, including the
frequency dispersion of the refractive index of the medium by coupling the
electromagnetic field to matter polarization fields. In a configuration with a
single black hole horizon, the spectrum of spontaneously emitted particles
presents some similarities with Hawking radiation. Furthermore, even in
horizonless systems spontaneous vacuum emission is still possible due to the
dispersive nature of the medium, yet with dramatically different spectral
properties.

a dichotomy in the temporal evolution as one tunes through a Mott
metal-to-insulator transition: in the metallic regime relaxation can be
characterized by evolution toward a steady-state electronic distribution well
described by Fermi-Dirac statistics with an increased effective temperature;
however, in the insulating regime this quasithermal paradigm breaks down with
relaxation toward a nonthermal state with a more complicated electronic
distribution that does not vary monotonically as a function of energy. We
characterize the behavior by studying changes in the energy, photoemission
response, and electronic distribution as functions of time. Qualitatively these
results should be observable on short enough time scales that the electrons
behave like an isolated system not in contact with additional degrees of
freedom which can act as a thermal bath. Importantly, proper modeling used to
analyze experimental findings should account for this behavior, especially when
using strong driving fields or studying materials whose physics may manifest
the effects of strong correlations.

ratio of M_2/M_1 = 0.017 +/- 0.004. The H_alpha and HeI6678 emission lines
additionally have a narrow central spike, as is often seen in the spectra of AM
CVn type stars. Comparing its properties with CVs, AM CVn systems and hydrogen

the first compelling example of an AM CVn system forming via the evolved CV

figure. Although the selection bias of this sample is not yet well defined,
these systems support the evolved CV model as a possible formation channel for

We generate light-cone outputs to compare directly the statistical properties

The angular cross-correlation between the SMGs and Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters is
significantly weaker than that between the SMGs and Lyman-break galaxies. The
cross-correlation is also weaker than the auto-correlation of the SMGs. The
redshift distribution of the SMGs shows a broad peak at $z \sim 2$, where
Bright SMGs contribute significantly to the global cosmic star formation rate

a large class of learning problems including the learning of sparse priors in

asymptotically consistent parameter estimates, which implies that the algorithm
achieves a reconstruction quality equivalent to the oracle algorithm that knows

coupled second order oscillators driven by white noises. It is shown that any
system of such coupled oscillators with positive damping and coupling
coefficients possesses a global random attractor. Moreover, when the damping
and the coupling coefficients are sufficiently large, the global random
attractor is a one-dimensional random horizontal curve regardless of the
strength of the noises, and the system has a rotation number, which implies
that the oscillators in the system tend to oscillate with the same frequency
eventually and therefore the so called frequency locking is successful. The
results obtained in this paper generalize many existing results on the
asymptotic dynamics for a single second order noisy oscillator to systems of
coupled second order noisy oscillators. They show that coupled damped second
order oscillators with large damping have similar asymptotic dynamics as the
limiting coupled first order oscillators as the damping goes to infinite and
also that coupled damped second order oscillators have similar asymptotic
dynamics as their proper space continuous counterparts, which are of great
practical importance.

experimental tests of general relativity and in building the astronomical
ephemerides of celestial bodies in the solar system with an unparalleled
precision. The cornerstone of the theory is the postulate that the solar system
is gravitationally isolated from the rest of the universe and the background
spacetime is asymptotically flat. The present article extends this theoretical
concept and formulates the principles of celestial dynamics of particles and
light moving in gravitational field of a localized astronomical system embedded
to the expanding Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe. We
formulate the precise mathematical concept of the Newtonian limit of Einstein's
field equations in the conformally-flat FLRW spacetime and analyze the geodesic
motion of massive particles and light in this limit. We prove that by doing
conformal spacetime transformations, one can reduce the equations of motion of
particles and light to the classical form of the Newtonian theory. However, the
time arguments in the equations of motion of particles and light differ from
each other in terms being proportional to the Hubble constant, H. This leads to
the important conclusion that the equations of light propagation used currently
by Space Navigation Centers for fitting range and Doppler-tracking observations
of celestial bodies are missing some terms of the cosmological origin that are
proportional to the Hubble constant, H. We also prove that the Hubble expansion
does not affect the atomic time scale used in creation of astronomical
ephemerides. We derive the cosmological correction to the light travel time
equation and argue that their measurement opens an exciting opportunity to
determine the local value of the Hubble constant, H, in the solar system

criteria for prolong the life time of wireless sensor network. In this paper,
we propose a two layer hierarchical routing protocol called Cluster Based
Hierarchical Routing Protocol (CBHRP). We introduce a new concept called
head-set, consists of one active cluster head and some other associate cluster
heads within a cluster. The head-set members are responsible for control and
management of the network. Results show that this protocol reduces energy
consumption quite significantly and prolongs the life time of sensor network as
compared to LEACH.

pre-galactic metal enrichment. We utilize the bright afterglow of a Pop III GRB
exploding in a primordial dwarf galaxy as a luminous background source, and
calculate the strength of metal absorption lines that are imprinted by the
first heavy elements in the intergalactic medium (IGM). To derive the GRB
absorption line diagnostics, we use an existing highly-resolved simulation of
the formation of a first galaxy which is characterized by the onset of atomic
hydrogen cooling in a halo with virial temperature >10^4 K. We explore the
unusual circumburst environment inside the systems that hosted Pop III stars,
modeling the density evolution with the self-similar solution for a champagne
flow. For minihalos close to the cooling threshold, the circumburst density is
roughly proportional to (1+z) with values of about a few cm^{-3}. In more
massive halos, corresponding to the first galaxies, the density may be larger,
n>100 cm^{-3}. The resulting afterglow fluxes may be detectable with the JWST
and VLA in the near-IR and radio wavebands, respectively, out to redshift z>20.
We predict that the maximum of the afterglow emission shifts from near-IR to
millimeter bands with peak fluxes from mJy to Jy at different observed times.
GRBs are ideal tools for probing the metal enrichment in the early IGM, due to
their high luminosities and featureless power-law spectra. The metals in the
first galaxies produced by the first supernova (SN) explosions are likely to
reside in low-ionization stages. We show that if the afterglow can be observed
sufficiently early, analysis of the metal lines can distinguish whether the
first heavy elements were produced in a PISN, or a core-collapse (Type II) SN,
thus constraining the initial mass function of the first stars.

we show that if we use architecturally restricted verifiers instead of
restricting the working memory, i.e. replacing the working tape(s) with a
single counter, we can define some IPS's for each decidable language. Such
verifiers are called two-way probabilistic one-counter automata (2pca's). Then,
we show that by adding a fixed-size quantum memory to a 2pca, called a two-way
one-counter automaton with quantum and classical states (2qcca), the protocol
can be space efficient. As a further result, if the 2qcca can use a quantum
counter instead of a classical one, then the protocol can even be public, also
known as Arthur-Merlin games.
  We also investigate the computational power of 2pca's and 2qcca's as language
recognizers. We show that bounded-error 2pca's can be more powerful than their
deterministic counterparts by giving a bounded-error simulation of their
nondeterministic counterparts. Then, we present a new programming technique for
bounded-error 2qcca's and show that they can recognize a language which seems
not to be recognized by any bounded-error 2pca. We also obtain some interesting

with VLTI/MIDI. This object is one of the few asymptotic giant branch (AGB)
stars that underwent a dust-obscuration event. The cause of such events is
still a matter of discussion. Several symmetric and asymmetric scenarios have
been suggested in the literature. Methods. Mid-infrared interferometric
observations were obtained separated by two years. The observations probe
different depths of the atmosphere and cover different pulsation phases. The
visibilities and the differential phases were interpreted using GEM-FIND, a
tool for fitting spectrally dispersed interferometric observations with the
help of wavelength-dependent geometric models. Results. We report the detection
of an asymmetric structure revealed through the MIDI differential phase. This
asymmetry is observed at the same baseline and position angle two years later.
The observations are best simulated with a model that includes a uniform-disc
plus a Gaussian envelope plus a point-source. The geometric model can reproduce
both the visibilities and the differential phase signatures. Conclusions. Our
MIDI data favour explanations of the R For obscuration event that are based on
an asymmetric geometry. We clearly detect a photocentre shift between the star
and the strongly resolved dust component. This might be caused by a dust clump
or a substellar companion. However, the available observations do not allow us
to distinguish between the two options. The finding has strong implications for
future studies of the geometry of the envelope of AGB stars: if this is a
binary, are all AGB stars that show an obscuration event binaries as well? Or
are we looking at asymmetric mass-loss processes (i.e. dusty clumps) in the
inner part of a carbon-rich Mira?

expressions with a single quantum auxiliary register. To evaluate such

conditioning, one of which is that quantum conditioning is strictly richer than
the usual classical conditioning.

DA white dwarfs is presented. An analysis of three DAs is performed, where
previous studies came to conflicting conclusions as to the stars' nitrogen
configurations. The nitrogen abundances were found to be in keeping with DAs of
higher Teff, with a homogeneous distribution. A search for circumstellar gas
discs was performed on eight stars, where circumstellar pollution may explain
the differences between predicted and observed metal abundances. No positive
detections were made. Already the subject of previous studies, the
circumstellar absorption features seen at many hot DAs were again analysed,
using a more advanced technique than those implemented in previous studies.
This allowed, for the first time, column density measurements for all
non-photospheric absorbing material. The derived column density measurements
are consistent with those predicted to exist in white dwarf Stromgren Spheres,
and the velocities of the absorbing material are not far from the velocities of
either the observed ISM or predicted LISM clouds along the stars' sight lines.
However, given the distances to some of the stars, it is unlikely that the
ionised material resides in the LISM in all cases; it may however be loosely
related to it. The observations here could not conclusively rule out the
ionisation of circumstellar material about the stars, though no evidence for
such material has yet been found. The velocity of the circumstellar material at
WD2218+706 is inconsistent with the expansion velocity of the PN at the star,
implying that the circumstellar material does not reside in the PN, though it
may have originated there. Once though to be related to these circumstellar
features, mass loss at the DAs has been ruled out, since the high log g of
these stars prohibits the loss of significant mass in a stellar wind.

was previously shown that upon increasing d from 0 to infinity, five different
structures of the bilayer Wigner crystal become energetically favored, starting
from a hexagonal lattice (phase I, d=0) and ending at a staggered hexagonal
lattice (phase V, d -> infinity). In this paper, we derive new series
representations of the ground-state energy for all five bilayer structures. The
derivation is based on a sequence of transformations for lattice sums of
Coulomb two-particle potentials plus the neutralizing background, having their
origin in the general theory of Jacobi theta functions. The new series provide
convenient starting points for both analytical and numerical progress. Its
convergence properties are indeed excellent: Truncation at the fourth term
determines in general the energy correctly up to 17 decimal digits. The
accurate series representations are used to improve the specification of
transition points between the phases and to solve a controversy in previous
studies. In particular, it is shown both analytically and numerically that the
hexagonal phase I is stable only at d=0, and not in a finite interval of small
distances between the plates as was anticipated before. The expansions of the
structure energies around second-order transition points can be done
analytically, which enables us to show that the critical behavior is of the

We show that the modifcation introduced in the cosmological equations leads to
several new solutions, only sourced by a perfect fluid, generalizing the

of its 'Managing Research Data' programme, to examine the way in which Big
Science data is managed, and produce any recommendations which may be
appropriate.
  Big science data is different: it comes in large volumes, and it is shared
and exploited in ways which may differ from other disciplines. This project has
explored these differences using as a case-study Gravitational Wave data
generated by the LSC, and has produced recommendations intended to be useful
variously to JISC, the funding council (STFC) and the LSC community.
  In Sect. 1 we define what we mean by 'big science', describe the overall data
culture there, laying stress on how it necessarily or contingently differs from
other disciplines.
  In Sect. 2 we discuss the benefits of a formal data-preservation strategy,
and the cases for open data and for well-preserved data that follow from that.
This leads to our recommendations that, in essence, funders should adopt rather
light-touch prescriptions regarding data preservation planning: normal data
management practice, in the areas under study, corresponds to notably good
practice in most other areas, so that the only change we suggest is to make
this planning more formal, which makes it more easily auditable, and more
amenable to constructive criticism.
  In Sect. 3 we briefly discuss the LIGO data management plan, and pull
together whatever information is available on the estimation of digital
preservation costs.
  The report is informed, throughout, by the OAIS reference model for an open
archive.

fixed clustercentric distance and at fixed stellar mass, lower density galaxies

clustercentric radius is much more sensitive to the density of a galaxy than to
its mass. We suggest that low density galaxies are more easily depleted of
their gas, because they are more easily affected by ram-pressure and/or tidal
forces. We also look at the dependence of our gas fraction/radius relations on
the velocity dispersion of the cluster, finding no clear systematic trend.

galaxy spectra. Rather than an alternative to existing automated tools, it is
put forward as an instrument for quick-look analysis, and for gaining physical
insight when interpreting the outputs provided by automated tools. Though the
recipe is of general application, it was developed for understanding the nature
of the Automatic Spectroscopic K-means based (ASK) template spectra. They
resulted from the classification of all the galaxy spectra in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey data release 7 (SDSS-DR7), thus being a comprehensive representation
of the galaxy spectra in the local universe. Using the recipe, we give a
description of the properties of the gas and the stars that characterize the
ASK classes, from those corresponding to passively evolving galaxies, to HII
galaxies undergoing a galaxy-wide starburst. The qualitative analysis is found
to be in excellent agreement with quantitative analyses of the same spectra. A
number of byproducts follow from the analysis. There is a tight correlation
between the age of the stellar population and the metallicity of the gas, which
is stronger than the correlations between galaxy mass and stellar age, and
galaxy mass and gas metallicity. The galaxy spectra are known to follow a
1-dimensional sequence, and we identify the luminosity-weighted mean stellar
age as the affine parameter that describes the sequence. All ASK classes happen
to have a significant fraction of old stars, although spectrum-wise they are
outshined by the youngest populations. Old stars are metal rich or metal poor
depending on whether they reside in passive galaxies or in star-forming
galaxies.

shorter than 0.3 days and total mass lower than about 1.4 solar mass. We show
that such systems have a long pre-contact phase, which lasts for 8-9 Gyrs,
while the contact phase takes only about 0.8 Gyr, which is rather a short
fraction of the total life. With low mass transfer rate during contact,
moderate mass ratios prevail in LMCBs since they do not have enough time to
reach extreme mass ratios often observed in higher mass binaries. During the
whole evolution both components of LMCBs remain within the MS band.
  The evolution of cool contact binaries towards merging is controlled by the
interplay between the evolutionary expansion of the less massive component
resulting in the mass transfer to the more massive component and the angular
momentum loss from the system by the magnetized wind. In LMCB the angular
momentum loss prevails. As a result, the orbital period systematically
decreases until the binary overflows the outer critical Roche surface and the
components merge into a single fast rotating star of a solar type surrounded by
a remnant disk carrying excess angular momentum. The disk can be a place of
planet formation with the age substantially lower than the age of a host star.
The calculated theoretical tracks show good agreement with the physical
properties of LMCB from the available observations. Estimates of the frequency
of occurrence of LMCB and the merger formation rate indicate that about 40
LMCBs and about 100 low mass merger products is expected to exist within 100 pc
from the Sun.

curves, respectively, while clusters are represented by simple closed regions.
A drawing of a clustered graph is c-planar if it has no edge-edge, edge-region,
or region-region crossings. Determining the complexity of testing whether a
clustered graph admits a c-planar drawing is a long-standing open problem in
the Graph Drawing research area. An obvious necessary condition for c-planarity
is the planarity of the graph underlying the clustered graph. However, such a
condition is not sufficient and the consequences on the problem due to the
requirement of not having edge-region and region-region crossings are not yet
fully understood.
  In order to shed light on the c-planarity problem, we consider a relaxed
version of it, where some kinds of crossings (either edge-edge, edge-region, or
region-region) are allowed even if the underlying graph is planar. We
investigate the relationships among the minimum number of edge-edge,
edge-region, and region-region crossings for drawings of the same clustered
graph. Also, we consider drawings in which only crossings of one kind are
admitted. In this setting, we prove that drawings with only edge-edge or with
only edge-region crossings always exist, while drawings with only region-region
crossings may not. Further, we provide upper and lower bounds for the number of
such crossings. Finally, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to test whether a
drawing with only region-region crossings exist for biconnected graphs, hence
identifying a first non-trivial necessary condition for c-planarity that can be
tested in polynomial time for a noticeable class of graphs.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  One of the main criteria in Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) that has
attracted the researchers' consideration is congestion control. Accordingly,
many algorithms have been proposed to alleviate the congestion problem,
although it is hard to find an appropriate algorithm for applications and
safety messages among them. Safety messages encompass beacons and event-driven
messages. Delay and reliability are essential requirements for event-driven
messages. In crowded networks where beacon messages are broadcasted at a high
number of frequencies by many vehicles, the Control Channel (CCH), which used
for beacons sending, will be easily congested. On the other hand, to guarantee
the reliability and timely delivery of event-driven messages, having a
congestion free control channel is a necessity. Thus, consideration of this
study is given to find a solution for the congestion problem in VANETs by
taking a comprehensive look at the existent congestion control algorithms. In
addition, the taxonomy for congestion control algorithms in VANETs is presented
based on three classes, namely, proactive, reactive and hybrid. Finally, we
have found the criteria in which fulfill prerequisite of a good congestion
control algorithm.

and cheap evaluation of the local Lipschitz constant of the objective's
gradient. This constant must ideally be chosen at every iteration as small as
possible, while serving in an indispensable upper bound for the value of the
objective function. In the previously existing variants of optimal first-order
methods, this upper bound inequality was constructed from points computed
during the current iteration. It was thus not possible to select the optimal
value for this Lipschitz constant at the beginning of the iteration.
  In our variant, the upper bound inequality is constructed from points
available before the current iteration, offering us the possibility to set the
Lipschitz constant to its optimal value at once. This procedure, even if
efficient in practice, presents a higher worse-case complexity than standard
optimal first-order methods. We propose an alternative strategy that retains
the practical efficiency of this procedure, while having an optimal worse-case
complexity. We show how our generic scheme can be adapted for smoothing
techniques, and perform numerical experiments on large scale eigenvalue
minimization problems. As compared with standard optimal first-order methods,
our schemes allows us to divide computation times by two to three orders of

constitutive relation, shear stress vs shear rate, which is most generally

For a huge amount of complex fluids, the up and down sweeps do not superimpose
and define a rheological hysteresis loop. By means of extensive rheometry
coupled to time-resolved velocimetry, we unravel the local scenario involved in
rheological hysteresis for various types of well-studied soft materials. We
introduce two observables that quantify the hysteresis in macroscopic rheology
and local velocimetry respectively, as a function of the sweep rate \delta
t^{-1}. Strikingly, both observables present a robust maximum with \delta t,
which defines a single material-dependent timescale that grows continuously
from vanishingly small values in simple yield stress fluids to large values for
strongly time-dependent materials. In line with recent theoretical arguments,
these experimental results hint at a universal timescale-based framework for
soft glassy materials, where inhomogeneous flows characterized by shear bands

the Sun, from the excellent range of telescopes aboard many spacecraft
complemented with observations from sophisticated ground-based telescopes have
opened up a new world producing significantly more complete information on the
physical conditions of the solar atmosphere than before. The interface between
the lower solar atmosphere where energy is generated by subsurface convection
and the corona comprises the chromosphere, which is dominated by jet-like,
dynamic structures, called mottles when found in quiet regions, fibrils when
found in active regions and spicules when observed at the solar limb. Recently,
space observations with Hinode have led to the suggestion that there should
exist two different types of spicules called Type I and Type II which have
different properties. Ground-based observations in the Ca II H and K
filtergrams reveal the existence of long, thin emission features called straws
in observations close to the limb, and a class of short-lived events called
rapid blue-shifted excursions characterized by large Doppler shifts that appear
only in the blue wing of the Ca II infrared line. It has been suggested that
the key to understanding how the solar plasma is accelerated and heated may
well be found in the studies of these jet-like, dynamic events. However, while
these structures are observed and studied for more than 130 years in the
visible, but also in the UV and EUV emission lines and continua, there are
still many questions to be answered. In this review we present observations and
physical properties of small-scale jet-like chromospheric events observed in

tunneling and on-site interactions. We apply a multi-orbital

with intrinsically occupation-dependent parameters. The resulting decrease of
the tunneling competes with a decrease of the total on-site interaction energy
both affecting the critical lattice depth of the superfluid to Mott insulator

large shift of the transition to shallower lattice depths with increasing
Bose-Fermi attraction. The applied theoretical model allows an accurate
prediction of the modified tunneling amplitudes and the critical lattice depth

China through case studies on eBook companies and a survey research with
individual eBook users. The information from three companies, Beijing Superstar
Electric Company, Beijing Founder APABI Technology Limited, and Beijing Sursen
Electronic Technology Company Limited, showed that the B2B market has been
developed due to the huge requirement from organization customers, universities
libraries in particularly, and the B2C market is still immature. The
information from interviews and relative data revealed that both Superstar and
Sursen have serious copyright infringement which is an important problem
impeding the further development of the eBook market. The questionnaire
explored awareness, purchase, reading and other experiences of eBook end-users.
Questions indicated that readers were attracted by the technical advantages
including costless to copy, easy to transfer, searchable and easy to store, but
did not want to pay for eBooks. Because the computers, especially desktop PCs,
were the main device for reading and the CRT displays were massive used while
there were few dedicated reading device in the market, many eBook end-users
still preferred to read extended passages of text on papers rather than
screens. Today the copyrights issue, user acceptance and the reading device are
three significant obstacles for eBook industry in China.

formation remains unclear, and two main theoretical scenarios have been
proposed so far to regulate the star-formation processes. The first model
assumes that turbulence in star-forming clumps plays a crucial role, and
especially that protostellar outflow-driven turbulence is crucial to support
cluster-forming clumps; while the second scenario is based on the consideration
of a magnetically-supported clump. Previous studies of the NGC 2264-C
protocluster indicate that, in addition to thermal pressure, some extra support
might effectively act against the gravitational collapse of this
cluster-forming clump. We previously showed that this extra support is not due
to the numerous protostellar outflows, nor the enhanced turbulence in this
protocluster. Here we present the results of the first polarimetric campaign
dedicated to quantifying the magnetic support at work in the NGC 2264-C clump.
Our Zeeman observations of the CN(1-0) hyperfine lines provide an upper limit
to the magnetic field strength B_los \leq0.6 mG in the protocluster (projected
along the line of sight). While these results do not provide sufficiently tight
constraints to fully quantify the magnetic support at work in NGC 2264-C, they
suggest that, within the uncertainties, the core could be either magnetically
super or sub-critical, with the former being more likely.

solar wind structures ranging in size from < 105 km to > 106 km was
characterized using one-minute time resolution observation of Interplanetary
Scintillation (IPS) made using the European Incoherent SCA Tter (EISCA T) radar
system. Simultaneously, the global structure and evolution of these features
was characterized by the Heliospheric Imagers (HI) on the Solar TERrestrial
RElations Observatory (STEREO) spacecraft, placing the IPS observations in
context. Of particular interest was the observation of one transient in the
slow wind apparently being swept up and entrained by a Stream Interaction
Region (SIR). The SIR itself was later detected in-situ at Venus by the
Analyser of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA-4) instrument on the Venus
Express (VEX) spacecraft. The availability of such diverse data sources over a
range of different time resolutions enables us to develop a global picture of
these complex events that would not have been possible if these instruments
were used in isolation. We suggest that the range of solar wind transients
discussed here maybe the interplanetary counterparts of transient structures
previously reported from coronagraph observations and are likely to correspond
to transient magnetic structures reported in in-situ measurements in
interplanetary space. The results reported here also provide the first
indication of heliocentric distances at which transients become entrained.

the context of the DIGIT key program. In addition to strong [OI] emission, a
number of OH doublets and a few weak highly excited lines of H2O are detected.
The presence of warm H2O in this Herbig disk is confirmed by a line stacking
analysis, enabled by the full PACS spectral scan, and by lines seen in Spitzer
data. The line fluxes are analyzed using an LTE slab model including line
opacity. The water column density is 10^14 - 10^15 cm^-2, and the excitation
temperature is 200-300 K implying warm gas with a density n > 10^5 cm^-3. For
OH we find a column density of 10^14 - 2x10^15 cm^-2 and T_ex ~ 300-500 K. For
both species we find an emitting region of r ~ 15-20 AU from the star. We argue
that the molecular emission arises from the protoplanetary disk rather than
from an outflow. This far-infrared detection of both H2O and OH contrasts with
near- and mid-infrared observations, which have generally found a lack of water
in the inner disk around Herbig AeBe stars due to strong photodissociation of
water. Given the similarity in column density and emitting region, OH and H2O
emission seems to arise from an upper layer of the disk atmosphere of HD
163296, probing a new reservoir of water. The slightly lower temperature of H2O
compared to OH suggests a vertical stratification of the molecular gas with OH
located higher and water deeper in the disk, consistent with thermo-chemical
models.

particularly suited to the study of models such as the hydrophobic-polar (HP)
lattice model of protein folding. With this generic and fully blind Monte Carlo
procedure, all currently known putative ground states for the most difficult
benchmark HP sequences could be found. For most sequences we could also
determine the entire energy density of states and, together with suitably
designed structural observables, explore the thermodynamics and intricate
folding behavior in the virtually inaccessible low-temperature regime. We
analyze the differences between random and protein-like heteropolymers for
sequence lengths up to 500 residues. Our approach is powerful both in terms of
robustness and speed, yet flexible and simple enough for the study of many
related problems in protein folding.

present the results of low-energy multifrequency monitoring by the GASP project
of the WEBT consortium and collaborators, as well as those of
spectropolarimetric/spectrophotometric monitoring at the Steward Observatory.
We also analyse high-energy observations of the Swift and Fermi satellites. In
the optical-UV band, several results indicate that there is a contribution from
a QSO-like emission component, in addition to both variable and polarised jet
emission. The unpolarised emission component is likely thermal radiation from
the accretion disc that dilutes the jet polarisation. We estimate its
brightness to be R(QSO) ~ 17.85 - 18 and derive the intrinsic jet polarisation
degree. We find no clear correlation between the optical and radio light
curves, while the correlation between the optical and \gamma-ray flux
apparently fades in time, likely because of an increasing optical to \gamma-ray
flux ratio. As suggested for other blazars, the long-term variability of 4C
38.41 can be interpreted in terms of an inhomogeneous bent jet, where different
emitting regions can change their alignment with respect to the line of sight,
leading to variations in the Doppler factor \delta. Under the hypothesis that
in the period 2008-2011 all the \gamma-ray and optical variability on a
one-week timescale were due to changes in \delta, this would range between ~ 7
and ~ 21. If the variability were caused by changes in the viewing angle
\theta\ only, then \theta\ would go from ~ 2.6 degr to ~ 5 degr. Variations in
the viewing angle would also account for the dependence of the polarisation
degree on the source brightness in the framework of a shock-in-jet model.

surprisingly, the transient ordering quasi-adiabatically follows a coherent

pronounced spin-phonon coupling in pnictides that supports rapid development of
a macroscopic order on small vibrational displacement even without breaking the

identical strengths. The mass of the lightest one, $\varsigma$, is $m_\varsigma
\approx m_\pi \frac{f_\pi}{2\sqrt{2}m_W/g} \approx\ 34\,KeV$; it is very weakly
coupled to matter except hadronic matter. The ratio of the two Higgs masses is
that of the two scales involved in the problem, the weak scale
$\sigma=\frac{2\sqrt{2}m_W}{g}$ and the chiral scale $v=f_\pi$, which are also
the respective vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs bosons. They can
freely coexist and be accounted for. The dependence of $m_\varsigma$ and
$m_\xi$ on $m_\pi$, that is, on quark masses, suggests their evolution when
more generations are added. Fermions get their masses from both Higgs
multiplets. The theory definitely stays in the perturbative regime.

release of magnetic energy from the convection zone to the high corona. We are
aiming at describing the first steps of the emergence of an active region
within a pre-existing quiet-Sun corona in terms of the thermal and magnetic
structure. We use unprecedented spatial, temporal and spectral coverage from
the Atmospheric Imager Assembly (AIA) and from the Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Starting on 30 May
2010 at 17:00 UT and for 8 hours, we follow the emergence of the active region
AR11076 within a quiet-Sun region. Using several SDO/AIA filters covering
temperatures from 50000K to 10 MK, we show that the emerging process is
characterised by a thermal shield at the interface between the emerging flux
and pre-existing quiet-Sun corona. The active region 11076 can be considered as
a peculiar example of emerging active region as (i) the polarities emerge in a
photospheric quiet-Sun region near a supergranular-like distribution, (ii) the
polarities forming the bipolar emerging structure do not rotate with respect to
each other indicating a small amount of twist in the emerging flux bundle.
There is a thermal shield formed at the interface between the emerging active
region and the pre-existing quiet-Sun region. The thermal shielding structure
deduced from all SDO/AIA channels exhibits a strong asymmetry between the two
polarities of the active region suggesting that the heating mechanism for one
polarity is more likely to be magnetic reconnection, whilst it is due to
increasing magnetic pressure for the opposite polarity.

self-consistent representation of the water cycle, with atmosphere-surface
interactions, atmospheric transport, and the radiative effects of CO2 and H2O
gas and clouds taken into account. We find that for atmospheric pressures
greater than a fraction of a bar, the adiabatic cooling effect causes
temperatures in the southern highland valley network regions to fall
significantly below the global average. Long-term climate evolution simulations
indicate that in these circumstances, water ice is transported to the highlands
from low-lying regions for a wide range of orbital obliquities, regardless of
the extent of the Tharsis bulge. In addition, an extended water ice cap forms
on the southern pole, approximately corresponding to the location of the
Noachian/Hesperian era Dorsa Argentea Formation. Even for a multiple-bar CO2
atmosphere, conditions are too cold to allow long-term surface liquid water.
Limited melting occurs on warm summer days in some locations, but only for
surface albedo and thermal inertia conditions that may be unrealistic for water
ice. Nonetheless, meteorite impacts and volcanism could potentially cause
intense episodic melting under such conditions. Because ice migration to higher
altitudes is a robust mechanism for recharging highland water sources after
such events, we suggest that this globally sub-zero, `icy highlands' scenario
for the late Noachian climate may be sufficient to explain most of the fluvial
geology without the need to invoke additional long-term warming mechanisms or
an early warm, wet Mars.

selection: the data are sparse and globally dependent, and models are typically
high-dimensional and have large numbers of latent variables. Together, these
issues mean that the usual model-selection criteria do not work properly for
networks. We illustrate these challenges, and show one way to resolve them, by
considering the key network-analysis problem of dividing a graph into
communities or blocks of nodes with homogeneous patterns of links to the rest
of the network. The standard tool for doing this is the stochastic block model,
under which the probability of a link between two nodes is a function solely of
the blocks to which they belong. This imposes a homogeneous degree distribution
within each block; this can be unrealistic, so degree-corrected block models
add a parameter for each node, modulating its over-all degree. The choice
between ordinary and degree-corrected block models matters because they make
very different inferences about communities. We present the first principled
and tractable approach to model selection between standard and degree-corrected
block models, based on new large-graph asymptotics for the distribution of
log-likelihood ratios under the stochastic block model, finding substantial
departures from classical results for sparse graphs. We also develop
linear-time approximations for log-likelihoods under both the stochastic block
model and the degree-corrected model, using belief propagation. Applications to
simulated and real networks show excellent agreement with our approximations.
Our results thus both solve the practical problem of deciding on degree
correction, and point to a general approach to model selection in network
analysis.

and a variety of organizing concepts are now taking shape into a more modern
and dynamic science of structure, form and function. Absolute stability and
equilibrium are replaced by metastable structures existing in a flux of
energy-carrying information and moving within an energy landscape of complex
topology. Structures give place to processes and processes to systems. The
fundamental level is that of atoms. As smaller and smaller groups of atoms are
used for their physical properties, quantum effects become important; already
we see quantum computation taking shape. Concepts move towards those in life
with the emergence of specifically informational structures. We now see the
possibility of the artificial construction of a synthetic living system,
different from biological life, but having many or all of the same properties.
Interactions are essentially nonlinear and collective. Structures begin to have
an evolutionary history with episodes of symbiosis. Underlying all the
structures are constraints of time and space. Through hierarchization, a more
general principle than the periodicity of crystals, structures may be found
within structures on different scales. We must integrate unifying concepts from
dynamical systems and information theory to form a coherent language and
science of shape and structure beyond crystals. To this end, we discuss the
idea of categorizing structures based on information according to the
algorithmic complexity of their assembly.

clusters in the second quadrant of the Milky Way. Methods: From the PPMXL
catalogue of positions and proper motions we took the subset of stars with
near-infrared photometry from 2MASS and added the remaining 2MASS stars without
proper motions (called 2MAst, i.e. 2MASS with astrometry). We developed a
data-processing pipeline including interactive human control of a standardised
set of multi-dimensional diagrams to determine kinematic and photometric
membership probabilities for stars in a cluster region. The pipeline
simultaneously produced the astrophysical parameters of a cluster. From
literature we compiled a target list of presently known open and globular
clusters, cluster candidates, associations, and moving groups. From established
member stars we derived spatial parameters (coordinates of centres and radii of
the main morphological parts of clusters) and cluster kinematics (average
proper motions and sometimes radial velocities). For distance, reddening, and
age determination we used specific sets of theoretical isochrones. Tidal
parameters were obtained by a fit of three-parameter King profiles to the
observed density distributions of members. Results: We investigated all 871
objects in the 2nd Galactic quadrant, of which we successfully treated 642 open
clusters, 2 globular clusters, and 8 stellar associations. The remaining 219
objects (24%) were recognised by us to be nonexistent clusters, duplicate
entries, or clusters too faint for 2MAst. We found that our sample is complete
in the 2nd quadrant up to a distance of 2 kpc, where the average surface
density is 94 clusters per kpc$^{2}$. Compared with literature values we found
good agreement in spatial and kinematic data, as well as for optical distances
and reddening. Small, but systematic offsets were detected in the age
determination.

Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect has already discovered many interesting objects,
thanks to the whole coverage of the sky. One of the SZ candidates detected in
the early months of the mission near to the signal to noise threshold,
PLCKG214.6+37.0, was later revealed by XMM-Newton to be a triple system of
galaxy clusters. We have further investigated this puzzling system with a
multi-wavelength approach and we present here the results from a deep
XMM-Newton re-observation. The characterisation of the physical properties of
the three components has allowed us to build a template model to extract the
total SZ signal of this system with Planck data. We partly reconciled the
discrepancy between the expected SZ signal from X-rays and the observed one,
which are now consistent at less than 1.2 sigma. We measured the redshift of
the three components with the iron lines in the X-ray spectrum, and confirmed
that the three clumps are likely part of the same supercluster structure. The
analysis of the dynamical state of the three components, as well as the absence
of detectable excess X-ray emission, suggest that we are witnessing the
formation of a massive cluster at an early phase of interaction.

consistent with a uniform distribution on the interval [0 degrees, 90 degrees].
With the assumption that the disk galaxies are oblate spheroids, we can compute
cos(beta), where beta is the angle between the rotation axes of the disks. In
the case that one galaxy in the binary is face-on or edge-on, the tilt
ambiguity is resolved, and cos(beta) can be computed unambiguously. For 94
isolated pairs with at least one face-on member, and for 171 isolated pairs

rotation on the apparent shape (i.e. the surface deformation), which could be
relevant for the electromagnetic emission, and on the internal matter
distribution (i.e. the quadrupole distortion), which could be relevant for the
emission of gravitational waves. Using a sample of eight different cold nuclear
physics equations of state, we have computed models of maximum field strength,
as well as the distortion coefficients for the surface and the quadrupolar
deformations. Surprisingly, we find that non-rotating models admit arbitrary
levels of magnetization, accompanied by a growth of size and quadrupole
distortion to which we could not find a limit. Rotating models, on the other
hand, are subject to a mass-shedding limit at frequencies well below the
corresponding ones for unmagnetized stars. Overall, the space of solutions can
be split into three distinct classes for which the surface deformation and the
quadrupole distortion are either prolate and prolate, oblate and prolate, or
oblate and oblate, respectively. We also derive a simple formula expressing the
relativistic distortion coefficients, which allows one to compute the surface
deformation and the quadrupole distortion up to significant levels of rotation
and magnetization, essentially covering all known magnetars. Such a formula
replaces Newtonian equivalent expressions that overestimate the magnetic
quadrupole distortion by about a factor of 6 and are inadequate for strongly
relativistic objects like neutron stars.

and Southern parts of the supernova remnant (SNR) HESS J1731$ - $347 with {\it
Suzaku} is presented. The shell portions covered by the observations emit hard
and line-less X-rays. The spectrum can be reproduced by a simple absorbed
power-law model with a photon index $\Gamma$ of 1.8-2.7 and an absorption
column density $N_{\rm H}$ of (1.0-2.1)$\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. These
quantities change significantly from region to region; the North-Western part
of the SNR has the hardest and most absorbed spectrum. The Western part of the
X-ray shell has a smaller curvature than North-Western and Southern shell
segments. A comparison of the X-ray morphology to the Very High Energy (VHE)
gamma-ray and radio images was performed. The efficiency of electron
acceleration and emission mechanism in each portion of the shell are discussed.
Thermal X-ray emission from the SNR was searched for but could not be detected
at a significant level.

spaced two concentric spheres that confine the massless scalar field is
calculated by using a direct mode summation with contour integration in the
complex plane of eigenfrequencies. We devoleped a new approach appropriate for
the calculation of the Casimir energy for spherical boundary conditions. The
Casimir energy for a massless scalar field between the closely spaced two
concentric spheres coincides with the Casimir energy of the parallel plates for
a massless scalar field in the limit when the dimensionless parameter {\eta},
({\eta}=((a-b)/(\surd(ab))) where a (b) is inner (outer) radius of sphere),
goes to zero. The efficiency of new approach is demonstrated by calculation of
the Casimir energy for a massless scalar field between the closely spaced two
concentric half spheres.

  convention and their origin","6 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In standard convention, the new complete orthonrmal sets of exponential type
orbitals (ETOs) are introduced as functions of the complex or real spherical
harmonics and modified and -generalized Laguerre polynomials (MPLs and GLPs),
where, and is the noninteger or integer (for) frictional quantum number. It is
shown that the origin of the ETOs, MLPs and GLPs is the self-frictional quantum
forces which are analog of radiation damping or self-frictional forces
introduced by Lorentz in classical electrodynamics. The relations for the
quantum self-frictional potentials in terms of ETOs, MLPs and GLPs,
respectively, are established. We note that, in the case of disappearing
frictional forces, the ETOs are reduces to the oringers wave functions for the
hydrogen-like atoms in standard convention and, therefore, become the
noncomplete.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:1107.5638,arXiv:1207.4098",,,,"cs.SE cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many Embedded Systems are indeed Software Based Control Systems (SBCSs), that
is control systems whose controller consists of control software running on a
microcontroller device. This motivates investigation on Formal Model Based
Design approaches for control software. Given the formal model of a plant as a
Discrete Time Linear Hybrid System and the implementation specifications (that
is, number of bits in the Analog-to-Digital (AD) conversion)
correct-by-construction control software can be automatically generated from
System Level Formal Specifications of the closed loop system (that is, safety
and liveness requirements), by computing a suitable finite abstraction of the
plant.
  With respect to given implementation specifications, the automatically
generated code implements a time optimal control strategy (in terms of set-up
time), has a Worst Case Execution Time linear in the number of AD bits $b$, but
unfortunately, its size grows exponentially with respect to $b$. In many
embedded systems, there are severe restrictions on the computational resources
(such as memory or computational power) available to microcontroller devices.
  This paper addresses model based synthesis of control software by trading
system level non-functional requirements (such us optimal set-up time, ripple)
with software non-functional requirements (its footprint). Our experimental
results show the effectiveness of our approach: for the inverted pendulum
benchmark, by using a quantization schema with 12 bits, the size of the small
controller is less than 6% of the size of the time optimal one.
