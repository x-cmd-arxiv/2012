to noise patterns. The centroiding precision achievable poses a limit on the
minimum stellar brightness required and, ultimately, on the observing time
required to reconstruct the wavefront. Maximum likelihood algorithms have been
developed at the Gaia SOC. They provide optimum performance according to the
Cr\'amer-Rao lower bound. Detailed wavefront reconstruction procedures, dealing
with partial telescope pupil sampling and partial microlens illumination have
also been developed. In this work, a brief overview of the WFS and an in depth

which corresponds to large mismatch $q$, the system becomes tantamount to the
recently studied single-component lattice with two embedded sites carrying the
cubic nonlinearity. The modes undergo qualitative changes with the variation of
$q$. In particular, at $l\geq 2$, the symmetry-breaking bifurcation (SBB),
which creates asymmetric states from symmetric ones, is supercritical and
subcritical for small and large values of $q$, respectively, while the
bifurcation is always supercritical at $l=1$. In the experiment, the

possible effect on Earth climate and also due to different interpretations of
long period solar variabilities, including the total solar irradiance. We
shortly review the topic and show that rather long term variations,
corresponding to a length well over a a solar magnetic cycle, are interesting
to consider. The very recently launched mission ""Picard"" is entirely devoted to
the topic but will just permit a short term evaluation. At the time of the last
total solar eclipse of 11/07/2010, several experiments were prepared to
precisely measure the transit time of the Moon related to the precise value of
the solar diameter. Preliminary results coming from the use of a specially
designed CNES photometer, put on different atolls of the French Polynesia, are
presented. In addition the results of new experiments devoted to fast
observations of flash spectra, including their precise chronodating, are
illustrated and discussed. A new definition of the edge of the Sun, free of
spurious scattered light effects strongly affecting all out of eclipse
observations, is emerging from these observations, in agreement with the most
advanced attempts of modelling the outer layers of the photosphere. We also
argue for a definite answer concerning the solar diameter measurement from
eclipses based on a better precision of lunar profiles coming from lunar
altimetry space experiments which will be possible in the following decades.

Modifications to Doppler lensing from redshift-space distortions are

affected by, planets in close orbits, via star-planet tidal interactions. To do
this, we used a standard equilibrium tidal model to compute the orbital
evolution of single planets orbiting both Sun-like stars and 0.1 M\odot
M-dwarfs. We tested two stellar spin evolution profiles, one with fast initial
rotation (P=1.2 day) and one with slow initial rotation (P=8 day). We tested
the effect of varying the stellar and planetary dissipation and the planet's
mass and initial orbital radius. Conclusions: Tidal evolution allows to
differentiate the early behaviors of extremely close-in planets orbiting either
a rapidly rotating star or a slowly rotating star. The early spin-up of the
star allows the close-in planets around fast rotators to survive the early
evolution. For planets around M-dwarfs, surviving the early evolution means
surviving on Gyr timescales whereas for Sun-like stars the spin-down brings
about late mergers of Jupiter planets. In light of this study, we can say that
differentiating between one spin evolution from another given the present
position of planets can be very tricky. Unless we can observe some markers of
former evolution it is nearly impossible to distinguish the two very different
spin profiles, let alone intermediate spin profiles. Though some conclusions
can still be drawn from statistical distributions of planets around fully
convective M-dwarfs. However, if the tidal evolution brings about a merger late
in its history it can also entail a noticeable acceleration of the star in late
ages, so that it is possible to have old stars that spin rapidly. This raises
the question of better constraining the age of stars.

(FQH)-like ground states arise in fractionally filled Chern bands (FCB). Here
we show that the Hamiltonian theory of Composite Fermions (CF) can be as useful
in describing the FCB as it was in describing the FQHE in the continuum. We are
able to introduce CFs into the FCB problem even though there is no external
magnetic field by following a two-stage process. First we construct an
algebraically exact mapping which expresses the electron density projected to
the Chern band, ${\rho}_{{\tiny FCB}}$, as a sum of Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman
density operators, ${\rho}_{{\tiny GMP}}$, that obey the Magnetic Translation
Algebra. Next, following our Hamiltonian treatment of the FQH problem, we
rewrite the GMP operators in terms of CF variables which reproduce the same
algebra. This naturally produces a unique Hartree-Fock ground state for the
CFs, which can be used as a springboard for computing gaps, response functions,
temperature-dependent phenomena, and the influence of disorder. We give two
concrete examples, one of which has no analog in the continuum FQHE with $\nu=
{1 \over 5}$ and $\sigma_{xy}={2\over 5}$. Our approach can be easily extended
to fractionally filled, strongly interacting two-dimensional
time-reversal-invariant topological insulators.

they are physically related, either via a particle physics mechanism or
anthropic selection. A pre-requisite for anthropic selection is the generation
of superhorizon-sized domains of different Omega_{B}/Omega_{DM}. Here we
consider generation of domains of different baryon density via random
variations of the phase or magnitude of a complex field Phi during inflation.
Baryon isocurvature perturbations are a natural consequence of any such
mechanism. We derive baryon isocurvature bounds on the expansion rate during
inflation H_{I} and on the mass parameter mu which breaks the global U(1)
symmetry of the Phi potential. We show that when mu < H_{I} (as expected in
SUSY models) the baryon isocurvature constraints can be satisfied only if H_{I}
is unusually small, H_{I} < 10^{7} GeV, or if non-renormalizable
Planck-suppressed corrections to the Phi potential are excluded to a high
order. Alternatively, an unsuppressed Phi potential is possible if mu is
sufficiently large, mu > 10^{16} GeV. We show that the baryon isocurvature
constraints can be naturally satisfied in Affleck-Dine baryogenesis, as a
result of the high-order suppression of non-renormalizable terms along MSSM
flat directions.

This population is difficult to explain if it formed through typical core
collapse supernovae, leading many authors to invoke electron capture
supernovae. Where Boyles et al. dealt only with non-recycled pulsars in
clusters, we focus on the pulsars that originated in clusters but then escaped
into the field of the Galaxy due to the kicks they receive at birth. The
magnitude of the kick induced by electron capture supernovae is not well known,
so we explore various models for the kick velocity distribution and size of the
population. The most realistic models are those where the kick velocity is <~
10 km/s and where the number of pulsars scales with the luminosity of the
cluster (as a proxy for cluster mass). This is in good agreement with other
estimates of the electron capture supernovae kick velocity. We simulate a
number of large-area pulsar surveys to determine if a population of pulsars
originating in clusters could be identified as being separate from normal disk
pulsars. We find that the spatial and kinematical properties of the population
could be used, but only if large numbers of pulsars are detected. In fact, even
the most optimistic surveys carried out with the future Square Kilometer Array
are likely to detect < 10% of the total population, so the prospects for
identifying these as a separate group of pulsars are presently poor.

functions arise in Tracy and Widom's theory of matrix models, where they
describe the fundamental probability distributions of random matrix theory.
Dyson considered such tau functions in the inverse spectral problem for

there exists a non-commutative differential ring ${\cal A}$ of operators in $H$
and a differential ring homomorphism $\lfloor\,\,\rfloor :{\cal A}\rightarrow

paper obtains conditions on $(-A,B,C)$ for Schr\""odinger's equation with
meromorphic $u$ to be integrable by quadratures. Special results apply to the
linear systems associated with scattering $u$, periodic $u$ and elliptic $u$.
The paper constructs a family of solutions to the Kadomtsev--Petviashivili

modulation of pulsation amplitudes and phases. The modulation is either
strictly periodic or it is quasi-periodic, with the modulation period and
modulation pattern varying from one cycle to the other. Such behaviour has not
been observed in any BL Her variable so far, however, it is a common property
of their lower luminosity siblings - RR Lyrae variables showing the Blazhko
effect. These models provide a support for the recent mechanism proposed by
Buchler & Kollath to explain this still mysterious phenomenon. In their model,
a half-integer resonance that causes the period doubling effect, discovered
recently in the Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, is responsible for the modulation of
the pulsation as well. Although our models are more luminous than is
appropriate for RR Lyrae stars, they clearly demonstrate, through direct
hydrodynamic computation, that the mechanism can indeed be operational.
  Of great importance are models which show quasi-periodic modulation - a
phenomenon observed in Blazhko RR Lyrae stars. Our models coupled with the
analysis of the amplitude equations show that such behaviour may be caused by
the dynamical evolution occurring in the close proximity of the unstable single
periodic saddle point.

stripped-envelope, core-collapse supernova (SN) 2011ei, one of the least
luminous SNe IIb or Ib observed to date. Our observations begin with a
discovery within 1 day of explosion and span several months afterward. Early
optical spectra exhibit broad, Type II-like hydrogen Balmer profiles that
subside rapidly and are replaced by Type Ib-like He-rich features on the
timescale of one week. High-cadence monitoring of this transition suggests that
absorption attributable to a high velocity (> 12,000 km/s) H-rich shell is not
rare in Type Ib events. Radio observations imply a shock velocity of v = 0.13c
and a progenitor star mass-loss rate of 1.4 x 10^{-5} Msun yr^{-1} (assuming
wind velocity v_w=10^3 km/s). This is consistent with independent constraints
from deep X-ray observations with Swift-XRT and Chandra. Overall, the
multi-wavelength properties of SN 2011ei are consistent with the explosion of a
lower-mass (3-4 Msun), compact (R* <= 1x10^{11} cm), He core star. The star
retained a thin hydrogen envelope at the time of explosion, and was embedded in
an inhomogeneous circumstellar wind suggestive of modest episodic mass-loss. We
conclude that SN 2011ei's rapid spectral metamorphosis is indicative of
time-dependent classifications that bias estimates of explosion rates for Type

decreases by roughly a factor of four from z \sim 3.2 to z \sim 4, with
faint-end slopes of {\beta} \sim -1.7 at both redshifts. The decline in space
density of faint optical quasars at z > 3 is similar to what has been found for
more luminous optical and X-ray quasars. We compare the rest-frame UV
luminosity functions found here with the X-ray luminosity function at z > 3,
and find that they evolve similarly between z \sim 3.2 and z \sim 4; however,
the different normalizations imply that roughly 75% of X-ray bright active

higher than found at lower redshift and may imply that the obscured, type-2

properties of dark matter halos, and the relationship between dark matter hosts

Bolshoi simulation. We associate galaxies with halos and subhalos using subhalo
abundance matching, performing a comprehensive analysis which investigates the
underlying assumptions of this technique including (a) which halo property is
most closely associated with galaxy stellar masses and luminosities, (b) how
much scatter is in this relationship, and (c) how much subhalos can be stripped
before their galaxies are destroyed. The models are jointly constrained by new
measurements of the projected two-point galaxy clustering and the observed
conditional stellar mass function of galaxies in groups. The data put tight
constraints on the satellite fraction of galaxies as a function of galaxy
stellar mass, on the scatter between halo and galaxy properties, and on the
underlying conditional stellar mass function. These data rule out several halo
properties commonly used in abundance matching, largely because the satellite
fractions in the models disagree with those data. We show that an abundance
matching model that associates galaxies with the peak circular velocity of
their halos is in good agreement with the data, when scatter of $0.20 \pm 0.03$
dex in stellar mass at a given peak velocity is included. This will yield
important constraints for galaxy formation models, and also provides
encouraging indications that the galaxy--halo connection can be modeled with
sufficient fidelity for future precision studies of the dark Universe.

radial magnetic field at the stellar surface and the potential-field source
surface method to extrapolate a 3D coronal magnetic field for a sample of

possible to force a solution towards field geometries that are symmetric or
antisymmetric about the equator but we demonstrate that this has only a modest
impact on the coronal tracers mentioned above. We find that the dipole
component of the field, which governs the large-scale structure, becomes
increasingly strong as the stellar mass decreases, while the magnitude of the
open (wind-bearing) magnetic flux is proportional to the magnitude of the
reconstructed magnetic flux. By assuming a hydrostatic and isothermal corona we
calculate X-ray emission measures (in magnitude and rotational modulation) for
each star and, using observed stellar densities as a constraint, we reproduce

size and a wire of uniform resistance. A linear charge distribution along the
wire maintains an electrostatic field and a steady current, which produces a
constant magnetic field. Earlier studies of the Poynting vector and the rate of
flow of energy considered only idealized geometries in which the Poynting
vector was confined to the space within the circuit. But in more realistic
cases the Poynting vector is nonzero outside as well as inside the circuit. An
expression is obtained for the Poynting vector in terms of products of
integrals, which are evaluated numerically to show the energy flow. Limiting
expressions are obtained analytically. It is shown that the total power
generated by the battery equals the energy flowing into the wire per unit time.

properties of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster member galaxies within two
massive systems at z~0.3: the merging Bullet Cluster and the more relaxed
MS2137.3-2353. Most star-forming cluster sources (~90%) have characteristic
dust temperatures similar to local field galaxies of comparable infrared (IR)
luminosity (T_dust ~ 30K). Several sub-LIRG (L_IR < 10^11 L_sun) Bullet Cluster
members are much warmer (T_dust > 37K) with far-infrared spectral energy
distribution (SED) shapes resembling LIRG-type local templates. X-ray and
mid-infrared data suggest that obscured active galactic nuclei do not
contribute significantly to the infrared flux of these ""warm dust"" galaxies.
Sources of comparable IR-luminosity and dust temperature are not observed in
the relaxed cluster MS2137, although the significance is too low to speculate
on an origin involving recent cluster merging. ""Warm dust"" galaxies are,
however, statistically rarer in field samples (> 3sigma), indicating that the
responsible mechanism may relate to the dense environment. The spatial
distribution of these sources is similar to the whole far-infrared bright
population, i.e. preferentially located in the cluster periphery, although the
galaxy hosts tend towards lower stellar masses (M_* < 10^10 M_sun). We propose
dust stripping and heating processes which could be responsible for the
unusually warm characteristic dust temperatures. A normal star-forming galaxy
would need 30-50% of its dust removed (preferentially stripped from the outer
reaches, where dust is typically cooler) to recover a SED similar to a ""warm
dust"" galaxy. These progenitors would not require a higher IR-luminosity or
dust mass than the currently observed normal star-forming population.

in the context of merger-driven quasar/galaxy co-evolution where these reddened

construct two new equations of state which match recent neutron star

contraction of a material in the same direction of an applied tension, and in
response to this tension, is inherently unstable. The conceptually similar

to a stress-induced solid-solid phase transition associated with a twisted

heuristic, Multiple Lists, which is a variant on Nearest Neighbor that trades
off compression for a major running-time speedup, is a good option for very
large tables. However, for some compression schemes, it is more important to
generate long runs rather than few runs. For this case, another novel

that the vortex core motion is described by the Thiele equation to very high
precision. At finite temperature, the second order Heun algorithm is applied to
the Langevin dynamical equation with thermal noise and damping. A spontaneous
gyrotropic motion takes place without the application of an external magnetic
field, driven only by thermal fluctuations. The statistics of the vortex radial
position and rotational velocity are described with Boltzmann distributions
determined by $k_F$ and by a vortex gyrotropic mass $m_G=G^2/k_F$,
respectively, where $G$ is the vortex gyrovector.

constitutes the first group catalogue showing statistically significant signs
of wide magnitude gaps (according to Tremaine-Richstone statistics) and
centrally located 1st-ranked galaxies, both consistent with the predictions

is consistent with a large deviation-like principle. As example, it is studied
the fluctuations of the work done on a dragged particle immersed in a complex
environment able to induce power-law tails. When the environment is
characterized by spatiotemporal temperature fluctuations, distributions arising
in nonextensive statistical mechanics define the work statistics. In that

characterized for the multi-user vector broadcast channel. A major insight is
that it is possible to achieve the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) gain if the

low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded amplitude phase-shift keying (APSK)
system. A subset of the interleaved bits output by a binary LDPC encoder are
passed through a nonlinear shaping encoder whose output is more likely to be a
zero than a one. The ""shaping"" bits are used to select from among a plurality
of subconstellations, while the unshaped bits are used to select the symbol
within the subconstellation. Because the shaping bits are biased, symbols from
lower-energy subconstellations are selected more frequently than those from
higher-energy subconstellations. An iterative decoder shares information among
the LDPC decoder, APSK demapper, and shaping decoder. Information rates are
computed for a discrete set of APSK ring radii and shaping bit probabilities,
and the optimal combination of these parameters is identified for the additive
white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. With the assistance of
extrinsic-information transfer (EXIT) charts, the degree distributions of the
LDPC code are optimized for use with the shaped APSK constellation. Simulation
results show that the combination of shaping, degree-distribution optimization,
and iterative decoding can achieve a gain in excess of 1 dB in AWGN at a rate
of 3 bits/symbol compared with a system that does not use shaping, uses an
unoptimized code from the DVB-S2 standard, and does not iterate between decoder
and demodulator.

optimal constants in Fourier analysis \newa{of Boolean functions} and
high-dimensional geometry.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item It has been known since 1994 \cite{GL:94} that every linear threshold
function has squared Fourier mass at least 1/2 on its degree-0 and degree-1
coefficients. Denote the minimum such Fourier mass by $\w^{\leq 1}[\ltf]$,
where the minimum is taken over all $n$-variable linear threshold functions and
all $n \ge 0$. Benjamini, Kalai and Schramm \cite{BKS:99} have conjectured that
the true value of $\w^{\leq 1}[\ltf]$ is $2/\pi$. We make progress on this
conjecture by proving that $\w^{\leq 1}[\ltf] \geq 1/2 + c$ for some absolute
constant $c>0$. The key ingredient in our proof is a ""robust"" version of the
well-known Khintchine inequality in functional analysis, which we believe may
be of independent interest.
  \item We give an algorithm with the following property: given any $\eta > 0$,
the algorithm runs in time $2^{\poly(1/\eta)}$ and determines the value of
$\w^{\leq 1}[\ltf]$ up to an additive error of $\pm\eta$. We give a similar
$2^{{\poly(1/\eta)}}$-time algorithm to determine \emph{Tomaszewski's constant}
to within an additive error of $\pm \eta$; this is the minimum (over all
origin-centered hyperplanes $H$) fraction of points in $\{-1,1\}^n$ that lie
within Euclidean distance 1 of $H$. Tomaszewski's constant is conjectured to be
1/2; lower bounds on it have been given by Holzman and Kleitman \cite{HK92} and
independently by Ben-Tal, Nemirovski and Roos \cite{BNR02}.
  Our algorithms combine tools from anti-concentration of sums of independent
random variables, Fourier analysis, and Hermite analysis of linear threshold
functions.

Enhanced imaging using a bolus of contrast agent, a procedure which allows

its permeability and is widely used in medical assessment of brain flows or
cancerous tumors. Although the study is motivated by medical imaging
application, we obtain a solution of a general problem of Laplace deconvolution

method for Laplace deconvolution which is based on expansions of the
convolution kernel, the unknown function and the observed signal over Laguerre
functions basis. The expansion results in a small system of linear equations
with the matrix of the system being triangular and Toeplitz. The number $m$ of
the terms in the expansion of the estimator is controlled via complexity
penalty. The advantage of this methodology is that it leads to very fast
computations, does not require exact knowledge of the kernel and produces no
boundary effects due to extension at zero and cut-off at $T$. The technique
leads to an estimator with the risk within a logarithmic factor of $m$ of the
oracle risk under no assumptions on the model and within a constant factor of
the oracle risk under mild assumptions. The methodology is illustrated by a
finite sample simulation study which includes an example of the kernel obtained
in the real life DCE experiments. Simulations confirm that the proposed
technique is fast, efficient, accurate, usable from a practical point of view

and B2B transactions, there is a pressing need for the development of
intelligent negotiation systems which consists of feasible architecture, a
reliable framework and flexible multi agent based protocols developed in
specialized negotiation languages with complete semantics and support for
message passing between the buyers and sellers. This is possible using web
services on the internet. The key issue is negotiation and its automation. In
this paper we review the classical negotiation methods and some of the existing
architectures and frameworks. We are proposing here a new combinatory framework
and architecture, NAAS. The key feature in this framework is a component for
prediction or probabilistic behavior pattern recognition of a buyer, along with
the other classical approaches of negotiation frameworks and architectures.
Negotiation is practically very complex activity to automate without human
intervention so in the future we also intend to develop a new protocol which
will facilitate automation of all the types of negotiation strategies like
bargaining, bidding, auctions, under our NAAS framework.

length $\delta x$ is performed after each time interval $\delta t$, are widely
used models for stochastic processes. In the case of a correlated random walk,
the next step has the same sign as the previous one with a probability $q \neq
1/2$. We extend this model to an inhomogeneous ensemble of random walkers with
a given distribution of persistence probabilites $p(q)$ and show that
remarkable statistical properties can result from this inhomogenity: Depending
on the distribution $p(q)$, we find that the probability density $p(\Delta x,
\Delta t)$ for a displacement $\Delta x$ after lagtime $\Delta t$ can have a
leptocurtic shape and that mean squared displacements can increase
approximately like a fractional powerlaw with $\Delta t$. For the special case
of persistence parameters distributed equally in the full range $q \in [0,1]$,
the mean squared displacement is derived analytically. The model is further
extended by allowing different step lengths $\delta x_j$ for each member $j$ of
the ensemble. We show that two ensembles $[\delta t, {(q_j,\delta x_j)}]$ and
$[\delta t^{\prime}, {(q^{\prime}_j,\delta x^{\prime}_j)}]$ defined at
different time intervals $\delta t\neq\delta t^{\prime}$ can have the same
statistical properties at long lagtimes $\Delta t$, if their parameters are
related by a certain scaling transformation. Finally, we argue that similar
statistical properties are expected for homogeneous ensembles, in which the
parameters $(q_j(t),\delta x_j(t))$ of each individual walker fluctuate
temporarily, provided the parameters can be considered constant for time
periods $T\gg\Delta t$ longer than the considered lagtime $\Delta t$.

surrounded by discs from which potentially planetary systems form. Of all
cluster environments starburst clusters are probably the most hostile for
planetary systems in our Galaxy. The intense stellar radiation and extreme
density favour rapid destruction of circumstellar discs via photoevaporation
and stellar encounters. Evolving a virialized model of the Arches cluster in
the Galactic tidal field we investigate the effect of stellar encounters on
circumstellar discs in a prototypical starburst cluster. Despite its proximity
to the deep gravitational potential of the Galactic centre only a moderate
fraction of members escapes to form an extended pair of tidal tails. Our
simulations show that encounters destroy one third of the circumstellar discs
in the cluster core within the first 2.5 Myr of evolution, preferentially
affecting the least and most massive stars. A small fraction of these events
causes rapid ejection and the formation of a weaker second pair of tidal tails
that is overpopulated by disc-poor stars. Two predictions arise from our study:
(i) If not destroyed by photoevaporation protoplanetary discs of massive late
B- and early O-type stars represent the most likely hosts of planet formation
in starburst clusters. (ii) Multi-epoch K- and L-band photometry of the Arches

considering an open Aharonov-Bohm ring with an embedded quantum dot. We develop
a novel many-body scattering theory which enables us to calculate the
conductance through the dot, the transmission phase shift, and the normalized
visibility, in terms of the single-particle T-matrix. For the single-channel
Kondo effect, we find at temperatures much below the Kondo temperature $T_K$
that the transmission phase shift is \pi/2 without any corrections up to order
(T/T_K)^2. The visibility has the form 1-(\pi T/T_K)^2. For the non-Fermi
liquid fixed point of the two channel Kondo, we find that transmission phase
shift is \pi/2 despite the fact that a scattering phase shift is not defined.
At zero temperature the visibility is 1/2, thus at zero temperature exactly
half of the conductance is carried by single-particle processes. We explain
that the spin summation masks the inherent scattering phases of the dot, which
can be accessed only via a spin-resolved experiment. In addition, we calculate
the effect of magnetic field and channel anisotropy, and generalize to the
k-channel Kondo case.

assigned to various types of SNe Ia. A lower mass range of WDs (1.38 Msun <
M_WD <~ 1.5 Msun), which are supported by rigid rotation, correspond to normal
SNe Ia. A variety of spin-down time may lead to a variation of brightness. A
higher mass range of WDs (M_WD >~ 1.5 Msun), which are supported by
differential rotation, correspond to brighter SNe Ia such as SN 1991T. In this
case, a variety of the WD mass may lead to a variation of brightness. We also
show the evolutionary states of the companion stars at SN Ia explosions and
pose constraints on the unseen companions. In the WD+RG systems, in particular,
most of the RG companions have evolved to helium/carbon-oxygen WDs in the
spin-down phase before the SN Ia explosions. In such a case, we do not expect
any prominent signature of the companion immediately before and after the
explosion. We also compare our new models with the recent stringent constraints

galaxies having optical R-magnitudes in the range 18-24 mag, and 52 components
lying within 1"" of a radio position in at least one further catalogue (either

redshifts of up to 0.825. Associating the radio sources with the Spitzer

models. In these models, interacting individuals, while participating in a
self-organizing process, give rise to the emergence of complex behaviors and
patterns. While one main focus in population genetics is on the adaptive
behavior of a population, social dynamics is more often concerned with the
splitting of a connected array of individuals into a state of global
polarization, that is, the emergence of speciation. Applying computational and
mathematical tools we show that the way the mechanisms of selection,
interaction and replacement are constrained and combined in the modeling have
an important bearing on both adaptation and the emergence of speciation.
Differently (un)constraining the mechanism of individual replacement provides
the conditions required for either speciation or adaptation, since these
features appear as two opposing phenomena, not achieved by one and the same
model. Even though natural selection, operating as an external, environmental
mechanism, is neither necessary nor sufficient for the creation of speciation,
our modeling exercises highlight the important role played by natural selection
in the interplay of the evolutionary and the self-organization modeling
methodologies.

categories : lossy and lossless image compression. There are many lossy digital
image compression techniques exists. Among this Incremental Self Organizing Map
is a familiar one. The good pictures quality can be retrieved if image
denoising technique is used for compression and also provides better
compression ratio. Image denoising is an important pre-processing step for many
image analysis and computer vision system. It refers to the task of recovering
a good estimate of the true image from a degraded observation without altering
and changing useful structure in the image such as discontinuities and edges.
Many approaches have been proposed to remove the noise effectively while
preserving the original image details and features as much as possible. This
paper proposes a technique for image compression using Incremental Self

growth series in the virtual reality of two simulations of the climate of the
last millennium. The simple, process-based Vaganov-Shashkin-Lite (VS-Lite) code
calculates tree growth responses controlled by a limited number of climatic
parameters. Growth limitation by different ambient climate conditions allows
for possible nonlinearity and non-stationarity in the pseudo tree growth
series. Statistical reconstructions of temperature are achieved from simulated
tree growth for random selections of pseudo-proxy locations by simple local
regression and composite plus scaling techniques to address additional
ambiguities in paleoclimate reconstructions besides the known uncertainty and
shortcomings of the reconstruction methods. A systematic empirical evaluation
shows that the interrelations between simulated target and reconstructed
temperatures undergo strong variations with possibly pronounced
misrepresentations of temperatures. Thus (i) centennial scale inter-annual
correlations can be very weak; (ii) the decadal range of reconstructed
temperatures may be as large as the range of the temperature variations over
the considered time-period; (iii) decadal variability is under-represented in
the reconstructions. The misrepresentations are in part due to the temporally
varying temperature-growth relations and to an apparent lack of decadal scale
variability in the simulated pseudo-growth series compared to the local
temperatures.

transport at a certain non-zero rotation rate ratio $a = -\omega_o / \omega_i$

explanation for this shift is elucidated, consistent with the experimental
result that $a_{opt}$ becomes approximately independent of the driving strength

perturbations by examining their joint dynamics in a two dimensional
density-velocity divergence phase space. We restrict to spatially flat
cosmologies consisting of pressureless matter and non-clustering dark energy
characterized by a constant equation of state $w$. Using the spherical top-hat
model, we derive the coupled equations that govern the joint evolution of the
perturbations and examine the flow generated by this system. In general, the
initial density and velocity are independent, but requiring that the
perturbations vanish at the big bang time sets a relation between the two. This
relation, which we call the `Zel'dovich curve', acts like an attracting
solution for the phase space dynamics and is the desired non-linear extension
of the density-velocity divergence relation. We obtain a fitting formula for
the curve, which is a generalization of the formulae by Bernardeau and Bilicki
& Chodorowski, and find that as in the linear regime, the explicit dependence
on the dark energy parameters stays weak even in the non-linear regime.
Although the result itself is somewhat expected, the new feature of this work
is the interpretation of the relation in the phase space picture and the
generality of the method. Finally, as an observational implication, we examine
the evolution of galaxy cluster profiles using the spherical infall model for
different values of $w$. We demonstrate that using only the density or the
velocity information to constrain $w$ is subject to degeneracies in other
parameters such as $\sigma_8$ but plotting observations onto the joint
density-velocity phase space can help lift this degeneracy.

detected in ~70% of our sample within the effective radius R_e, the remaining
30% having a flat color profile. Extending the analysis at R>R_e we have found
that the fraction of high-z ETGs with negative F850LP-F160W color gradients
rises up to 100%. For each galaxy, we investigate the origin of the radial
color variation with a technique based on the matching of both the spatially
resolved color and the global spectral energy distribution (SED) to predictions
of composite stellar population models. In fact, we find that the age of the
stellar populations is the only parameter whose radial variation alone can
fully account for the observed color gradients and global SEDs for half of the
galaxies in our sample (6 ETGs), without the need of radial variation of any
other stellar population property. For four out of these six ETGs, a pure
metallicity variation can also reproduce the detected color gradients.
Nonetheless, a minor contribution to the observed color gradients from radial
variation of star-formation time scale, abundance of low-to-high mass stars and
dust cannot be completely ruled out. For the remaining half of the sample, our
analysis suggests a more complex scenario whereby more properties of the
stellar populations need to simultaneously vary to generate the observed color
gradients and global SED. Our results show that, despite the young mean age of
our galaxies (<3-4 Gyr), they already exhibit significant differences among
their stellar content. We have discussed our results within the framework of
the widest accepted scenarios of galaxy formation and conclude that none of
them can satisfactorily account for the observed distribution of color
gradients and for the spatially resolved content of high-z ETGs.

model is able to produce a shape transition. However, the resulting transition
is too rapid, with nuclei that should be transitional being fairly well
deformed, perhaps reflecting the need to maintain several pairs with each
angular momentum.

scaling function representation, can deal with any kind of periodicity (along
one, two, or three spatial axes) as well as with fully isolated boundary
conditions. It can seamlessly accommodate a finite screening length,
non-orthorhombic lattices and charged systems. This approach is particularly
advantageous because convergence is attained by simply refining the real space
grid, namely without any adjustable parameter. At the same time, the numerical
method features O(N log N) scaling of the computational cost (N being the
number of grid points) very much like plane-wave methods. The methodology,
validated on model systems, is tailored for leading-edge computer simulations
of materials (including ab initio electronic structure computations), but it
might as well be beneficial for other research domains.

have been derived from long-term observations of the planets' satellite
motions, and modified shape and solid-body rotation periods were suggested. A
faster rotation period (-40 min) for Uranus and a slower rotation period
(+1h20) of Neptune compared to the Voyager data were found to minimize the
dynamical heights and wind speeds. We apply the improved gravity data, the
modified shape and rotation data, and the physical LM-R equation of state to
compute adiabatic three-layer structure models, where rocks are confined to the
core, and homogeneous thermal evolution models of Uranus and Neptune. We
present the full range of structure models for both the Voyager and the
modified shape and rotation data. In contrast to previous studies based solely
on the Voyager data or on empirical EOS, we find that Uranus and Neptune may
differ to an observationally significant level in their atmospheric heavy
element mass fraction Z1 and nondimensional moment of inertia, nI. For Uranus,
we find Z1 < 8% and nI=0.2224(1), while for Neptune Z1 < 65% and nI=0.2555(2)
when applying the modified shape and rotation data, while for the unmodified
data we compute Z1 < 17% and nI=0.230(1) for Uranus and Z1 < 54% and
nI=0.2410(8) for Neptune. In each of these cases, solar metallicity models
(Z1=0.015) are still possible. The cooling times obtained for each planet are
similar to recent calculations with the Voyager rotation periods: Neptune's
luminosity can be explained by assuming an adiabatic interior while Uranus
cools far too slowly. More accurate determinations of these planets' gravity
fields, shapes, rotation periods, atmospheric heavy element abundances, and
intrinsic luminosities are essential for improving our understanding of the
internal structure and evolution of icy planets.

Magnetically stable trial magnetisation states of the object of interest are
input into MALTS and simulated LTEM images are output. MALTS computes the
magnetic and electric phases accrued by the transmitted electrons via the
Aharonov-Bohm expressions. Transfer and envelope functions are used to simulate
the progression of the electron wave through the microscope lenses. The final
contrast image due to these effects is determined by Fourier Optics. Similar
approaches have been used previously for simulations of specific cases of LTEM
contrast. The novelty here is the integration with micromagnetic codes via a
simple user interface enabling the computation of the contrast from any
structure. The output from MALTS is in good agreement with both experimental
data and published LTEM simulations. A widely-available generalized code for
the analysis of Lorentz contrast addresses is a much needed step towards the
use of LTEM as a standardized laboratory technique.

  to appear in Phys. Lett. B",,"10.1016/j.physletb.2012.10.034",,"hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For flavor neutrino masses M^{PDG}_{ij} (i,j=e,mu,tau) compatible with the
phase convention defined by Particle Data Group (PDG), if neutrino mixings are
controlled by small corrections to those with sin(theta_{13})=0 denoted by
sin(theta_{13})deltaM^{PDG}_{e tau} and sin(theta_{13})deltaM^{PDG}_{tau tau},
CP-violating Dirac phase delta{CP} is calculated by using these corrections. If
possible neutrino mass hierarchies are taken into account, the main source of
delta{CP} turns out to be deltaM_{e tau}^{PDG} except for the inverted mass
hierarchy with {m}_1 approx -{m}_2, where {m}_i=m_ie^{-i varphi_i} (i=1,2)
stands for a neutrino mass m_i accompanied by a Majorana phase varphi_i for
varphi_{1,2,3} giving two CP-violating Majorana phases. We can further derive
that delta_{CP} approx arg(M_{e mu}^{PDG})-arg(M_{mu mu}^{PDG}) with arg (M_{e
mu}^{PDG}) approx arg(M_{e tau}^{PDG}) for the normal mass hierarchy and
delta_{CP} approx arg(M_{ee}^{PDG})-arg(M_{e tau}^{PDG})+pi for the inverted
mass hierarchy with {m}_1 approx {m}_2. For specific flavor neutrino masses
M_{ij} whose phases arise from M_{e mu,e tau,tau tau}, these phases can be
connected with arg(M_{ij}^{PDG}) (i,j=e,mu,tau). As a result, numerical
analysis suggests that Dirac CP-violation becomes maximal as |arg(M_{e mu})|
approaches to pi/2 for the inverted mass hierarchy with {m}_1 approx {m}_2 and
for the degenerate mass pattern satisfying the inverted mass ordering and that
Majorana CP-violation becomes maximal as |arg(M_{tau tau})| approaches to its
maximal value around 0.5 for the normal mass hierarchy. Alternative
CP-violation induced by three CP-violating Dirac phases is compared with the
conventional one induced by delta{CP} and two CP-violating Majorana phases.

huge baseline drift and hundreds of translocation spikes. Thus, incorporation
of suitable signal processing algorithms is necessary for correct and fast
detection of all the translocation spikes and to accurately measure their
amplitude and duration. Generally, low-pass filtering is used for denoising,
averaging is used for baseline detection, and thresholding is used for spike
detection and measurement. Here we present novel algorithms and specifically
developed software for nanopore signal processing that are significantly
improving the accuracy of the nanopore measurements. It includes an improved
method for baseline removing, an optimized algorithm for denoising the nanopore

between those experiments and the models describing quantum fluctuations in

concept of the phase slip is justified when these fluctuations are the
relatively rare events, meaning that the effective resistance of the system

the limit of the strong quantum fluctuations where the existing models are not

demonstrated that below the expected critical temperature the resistance does
not demonstrate any trend towards the conventional for a superconductor
zero-resistivity state even at negligibly small measuring currents. Application
of a small magnetic field leads to an unusual negative magnetoresistance, which
becomes more pronounced at lower temperatures. The origin of the negative
magnetoresistance effect is not clear.

found by reducing the coupled soil moisture and salt mass balance equation to a
single stochastic differential equation driven by multiplicative Poisson noise.
The novel analytical solutions provide insight on the interplay of the main
soil, plant and climate parameters responsible for long-term soil salinization.
In particular, they show the existence of two distinct regimes, one where the
mean salt mass remains nearly constant (or decreases) with increasing rainfall
frequency, and another where mean salt content increases markedly with
increasing rainfall frequency. As a result, relatively small reductions of
rainfall in drier climates may entail dramatic shifts in long-term soil

algorithm is related to the Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables recently introduced
by Goodrich et al., with two important distinctions - SHO-FA relies on linear
measurements, and is robust to noise. The SHO-FA algorithm is the first to
simultaneously have the following properties: (a) it requires only O(k)
measurements, (b) the bit-precision of each measurement and each arithmetic
operation is O (log(n) + P) (here 2^{-P} is the desired relative error in the
reconstruction of x), (c) the decoding complexity is O(k) arithmetic operations
and encoding complexity is O(n) arithmetic operations, and (d) if the
reconstruction goal is simply to recover a single component of x instead of all
of x, with significant probability over A this can be done in constant time.
All constants above are independent of all problem parameters other than the
desired success probability. For a wide range of parameters these properties
are information-theoretically order-optimal. In addition, our SHO-FA algorithm
works over fairly general ensembles of ""sparse random matrices"", is robust to
random noise, and (random) approximate sparsity for a large range of k. In
particular, suppose the measured vector equals A(x+z)+e, where z and e
correspond respectively to the source tail and measurement noise. Under
reasonable statistical assumptions on z and e our decoding algorithm
reconstructs x with an estimation error of O(||z||_2 +||e||_2). The SHO-FA
algorithm works with high probability over A, z, and e, and still requires only
O(k) steps and O(k) measurements over O(log n)-bit numbers. This is in contrast

also known as D0L systems with periodic control, PD0L systems for short. These
systems give rise to a class of one-sided infinite sequences, called PD0L
words.
  We construct a PD0L word with exponential subword complexity, thereby
answering a question raised by Lepisto (1993) on the existence of such words.
We solve another open problem concerning the decidability of the first-order
theories of PD0L words; we show it is already undecidable whether a certain
letter occurs in a PD0L word. This stands in sharp contrast to the situation
for D0L words (purely morphic words), which are known to have at most quadratic
subword complexity, and for which the monadic theory is decidable.
  The main result of our paper, leading to these answers, is that every
computable word w over an alphabet Sigma can be embedded in a PD0L word u over
an extended alphabet Gamma in the following two ways: (i) such that every
finite prefix of w is a subword of u, and (ii) such that w is obtained from u
by erasing all letters from Gamma not in Sigma. The PD0L system generating such
a word u is constructed by encoding a Fractran program that computes the word
w; Fractran is a programming language as powerful as Turing Machines.
  As a consequence of (ii), if we allow the application of finite state
transducers to PD0L words, we obtain the set of all computable words. Thus the
set of PD0L words is not closed under finite state transduction, whereas the
set of D0L words is. It moreover follows that equality of PD0L words (given by
their PD0L system) is undecidable. Finally, we show that if erasing morphisms
are admitted, then the question of productivity becomes undecidable, that is,
the question whether a given PD0L system defines an infinite word.

  variance",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classical analysis of variance requires that model terms be labeled as fixed
or random and typically culminate by comparing variability from each batch
(factor) to variability from errors; without a standard methodology to assess
the magnitude of a batch's variability, to compare variability between batches,
nor to consider the uncertainty in this assessment. In this paper we support
recent work, placing ANOVA into a general multilevel framework, then refine
this through batch level model specifications, and develop it further by
extension to the multivariate case. Adopting a Bayesian multilevel model
parametrization, with improper batch level prior densities, we derive a method
that facilitates comparison across all sources of variability. Whereas
classical multivariate ANOVA often utilizes a single covariance criterion, e.g.
determinant for Wilks' lambda distribution, the method allows arbitrary
covariance criteria to be employed. The proposed method also addresses
computation. By introducing implicit batch level constraints, which yield
improper priors, the full posterior is efficiently factored, thus alleviating
computational demands. For a large class of models, the partitioning mitigates,
or even obviates the need for methods such as MCMC. The method is illustrated
with simulated examples and an application focusing on climate projections with
global climate models.

different SSS properties of CNe in the M 31 bulge and disk were indicated by
recent X-ray population studies, which however considered only a small number

XMM-Newton to observe the SSS phases of CNe in the disk of M 31 and improve the

observations triggered in Aug 2011 and Jan 2012, respectively, and extracted
X-ray spectra and light curves. We report the discovery of an X-ray counterpart
to the M 31 disk nova M31N 2008-05d. The X-ray spectrum of the object allows us
to classify it as a SSS parametrised by a blackbody temperature of 32+/-6 eV.
More than three years after the nova outburst, the X-ray light curve of the SSS
exhibits irregular, broad dip features. These dips affect primarily the very
soft part of the X-ray spectrum, which might indicate absorption effects.
Dipping SSS light curves are rarely observed in M 31 novae. As well as
providing an unparalleled statistical sample, the M 31 population of novae with
SSS counterparts produces frequent discoveries of unusual objects, thereby
underlining the importance of regular monitoring.

The models have different initial magnetic field strengths and field

of M-dwarfs are highly dynamic and intermittent. Magnetic fields and
propagating shock waves produce a complicated fine-structure, which is clearly
visible in synthetic intensity maps in the core of the Ca II K spectral line
and also at millimeter wavelengths. The dynamic small-scale pattern cannot be
described by means of one-dimensional models, which has important implications
for the construction of semi-empirical model atmospheres and thus for the
interpretation of observations in general. Detailed three-dimensional numerical
simulations are valuable in this respect. Furthermore, such models facilitate
the analysis of small-scale processes, which cannot be observed on stars but
nevertheless might be essential for understanding M-dwarf atmospheres and their
activity. An example are so-called ""magnetic tornadoes"", which have recently
been found on the Sun and are presented here in M-dwarf models for the first

with where subjects fixate, and why they fixated where they fixated. To a first
approximation, a set of fixations can be viewed as a set of points in space:
this implies that fixations are spatial data and that the analysis of fixation
locations can be beneficially thought of as a spatial statistics problem. We
argue that thinking of fixation locations as arising from point processes is a
very fruitful framework for eye movement data, helping turn qualitative
questions into quantitative ones.
  We provide a tutorial introduction to some of the main ideas of the field of
spatial statistics, focusing especially on spatial Poisson processes. We show
how point processes help relate image properties to fixation locations. In
particular we show how point processes naturally express the idea that image
features' predictability for fixations may vary from one image to another. We
review other methods of analysis used in the literature, show how they relate
to point process theory, and argue that thinking in terms of point processes
substantially extends the range of analyses that can be performed and clarify
their interpretation.

thin film wrapped around a sphere under the action of capillary forces. A rigid
sphere is coated with a wetting liquid, and then wrapped by a thin film into an
initially cylindrical shape. The equilibrium of this cylindrical shape is
governed by the antagonistic effects of elasticity and capillarity: elasticity
tends to keep the film developable while capillarity tends to curve it in both
directions so as to maximize the area of contact with the sphere. In the
experiments, the contact area between the film and the sphere has cylindrical
symmetry when the sphere radius is small, but destabilises to a non-symmetric,
wrinkled configuration when the radius is larger than a critical value. We
combine the Donnell equations for near-cylindrical shells to include a
unilateral constraint with the impenetrable sphere, and the capillary forces
acting along a moving edge. A non-linear solution describing the axisymmetric
configuration of the film is derived. A linear stability analysis is then
presented, which successfully captures the wrinkling instability, the symmetry
of the unstable mode, the instability threshold and the critical wavelength.
The motion of the free boundary at the edge of the region of contact, which has
an effect on the instability, is treated without any approximation.

implies that the dark matter density profile decreases exponentially with the
gravitational potential in this region. It is curious that this behavior is
identical to what one would have from a Boltzmann gas in thermal equilibrium.
This suggests that an {\it effective} Boltzmann gas description of dark matter
is possible for the halo, which follows even though no requirement of thermal
equilibrium is assumed for the dark matter particles. We examine some
qualitative and quantitative consequences of such an effective description.
This is done by studying a simple model that takes into account gravitational
self-interactions of dark matter and its gravitational interactions with the
baryonic core.
  Solutions to the dynamics are determined by two parameters, one of which is
the ratio of the dark matter mass to the effective temperature of the gas.
Crude estimates can be made for these parameters based on observations.

planet host and non-host samples in term of their [X/H]. The extensive study of
this sample, focused on the abundance differences between stars with and

separate the Galactic stellar populations we applied both a purely kinematical

on the Mg, Si, and Ti abundances) thin and thick discs are also chemically
disjunct for Al, Sc, Co and Ca. Some bifurcation might also exist for Na, V,
Ni, and Mn, but there is no clear boundary of their [X/Fe] ratios. We confirm
that an overabundance in giant-planet host stars is clear for all the studied

Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) phase transition is second order but the
critical temperature $T_c$ is not shifted from the non-interacting gas value
$T_0$. The spectrum of excitations in the BEC phase resembles the Bogoliubov
dispersion with the usual coupling constant replaced by the running coupling
constant which depends on both temperature and momentum. We then study
two-component Bose gases with both inter- and intra- species interactions and
focus on the stability of the mixture state above $T_c$. Our mean-field
approximation predicts an instability from the mixture state to a
phase-separated state when the ratio of the inter-species interaction strength
to the intra-species interaction strength (assuming equal strength for both
species) exceeds a critical value. At high temperature this is a structural
transition and the global translational symmetry is broken. Our work
complements previous studies on the instability of the mixture phase in the

found that inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions in the two methods
results in significant increases in intra- or inter-ring exciton transfer
efficiency. The dependence of exciton transfer efficiency on trapping positions
on single rings of LH2 (B850) and LH1 is similar to that in toy models with
nearest-neighbor coupling only. However, owing to the symmetry breaking caused
by the dimerization of BChls and dipolar couplings, such dependence has been
largely suppressed. In the studies of coupled-ring systems, both methods reveal
interesting role of dipolar interaction in increasing energy transfer
efficiency by introducing multiple intra/inter-ring transfer paths.
Importantly, the time scale (~4ps) of inter-ring exciton transfer obtained from
polaron dynamics is in good agreement with previous studies. In a double-ring
LH2 system, dipole-induced symmetry breaking leads to global minima and local
minima of the average trapping time when there is a finite value of non-zero
dephasing rate, suggesting that environment plays a role in preserving quantum
coherent energy transfer. In contrast, dephasing comes into play only when the
perfect cylindrical symmetry in the hypothetic system is broken. This study has
revealed that dipolar interaction between chromophores may play an important
part in the high energy transfer efficiency in the LH2 system and many other
natural photosynthetic systems.

cosmology. We assume dark energy as a perfect fluid and choose a specific
cosmologically viable form $f(T)= \beta\sqrt{T} $. We show that there is one
attractor solution to the dynamical equation of $f(T)$ Friedmann equations.
Further we investigate the stability in phase space for a general $f(T)$ model
with two interacting fluids. By studying the local stability near the critical
points, we show that the critical points lie on the sheet $u^*=(c-1)v^*$ in the
phase space, spanned by coordinates $(u,v,\Omega,T)$. From this critical sheet,
we conclude that the coupling between the dark energy and matter $c\in (-2,0)$.

to get closer to a fully automatic process of analysing the behaviour of a
system specified as a process of the Markovian Process Algebra ROSA. In this
first development stage, ROSA Analyser is able to generate the Labelled
Transition System, according to ROSA Operational Semantics.
  ROSA Analyser performance starts with the Syntactic Analysis so generating a
layered structure, suitable to then, apply the Operational Semantics Transition
rules in the easier way. ROSA Analyser is able to recognize some states
identities deeper than the Syntactic ones. This is the very first step in the
way to reduce the size of the LTS and then to avoid the state explosion
problem, so making this task more tractable.
  For the sake of better illustrating the usefulness of ROSA Analyser, a case
study is also provided within this work.

The United Nations predicts 17% of purchases by firms and individuals will be
conducted online by 2006. The future of Web-based e-banking in developed areas
appears bright but consumers and merchants in developing countries face in
number of barriers to successful e-banking, including less reliable
telecommunications infrastructure and power supplies, less access to online
payment mechanisms, and relatively high costs for personal computers and
Internet access. How should managers in charge of e-banking prepare for global
implementation? What can they do reach consumers in developing countries? What
factors influence the adoption of consumer-oriented e-banking in various
countries? This research paper will give you the idea on the local conditions
in India, the Hofstede's dimension of culture in India and USA, the Diffusion
of Innovation theory and hence the hypotheses for the innovation
characteristics of interest.

intermediate $Z^{0}$-weak-boson is realized as the composite particle and that
its scalar partner has the mass value larger than $Z^{0}$-weak-boson mass. It
is suggested that 125 Gev Higgs-boson found at LHC is a scalar partner of 91
Gev $Z^{0}$-weak-boson. We predict the existence of charged Higgs-bosons with
the mass value around 100 to 120 Gev as the scalar partners of $W^{\pm}$. We
also discuss about Dark energy and Dark matter.

aspects of abstract software architecture. The behavioral aspects are described
in CSP and checked using the model-checker FDR. While the ADL Wright does not
offer any means to realize such architectures abstract. The objective of this
work is to open up the ADL Wright for Ada through an automated approach based
on MDE. To achieve this, we have developed two Ecore meta-models: the
meta-model Wright and the partial meta-model of Ada. Moreover, we have
designed, built and tested our program Wright2Ada written in ATL to transform
software architecture described in Wright to a concurrent program in Ada.

dimensions with an additional cross-diffusion term in the elliptic equation for
the chemical signal is analyzed. The main feature of the model is that there
exists a new entropy functional yielding gradient estimates for the cell
density and chemical concentration. The main features of the numerical scheme
are positivity preservation, mass conservation, entropy stability, and - under
additional assumptions - entropy dissipation. The existence of a discrete
solution and its numerical convergence to the continuous solution is proved.
Furthermore, temporal decay rates for convergence of the discrete solution to
the homogeneous steady state is shown using a new discrete logarithmic Sobolev
inequality. Numerical examples point out that the solutions exhibit
intermediate states and that there exist nonhomogeneous stationary solutions
with a finite cell density peak at the domain boundary.
