encoded in the firing rates of neural populations. Each neuron in the
populations, however, does not spike independently: spike events are correlated
from cell to cell. To what degree does this apparent redundancy impact the
accuracy with which decisions can be made, and the computations that are
required to optimally decide? We explore these questions for two illustrative
models of correlation among cells. Each model is statistically identical at the
level of pairs cells, but differs in higher-order statistics that describe the
simultaneous activity of larger cell groups. We find that the presence of
correlations can diminish the performance attained by an ideal decision maker
to either a small or large extent, depending on the nature of the higher-order
interactions. Moreover, while this optimal performance can in some cases be
obtained via the standard integration-to-bound operation, in others it requires
a nonlinear computation on incoming spikes. Overall, we conclude that a given
level of pairwise correlations--even when restricted to identical neural
populations--may not always indicate redundancies that diminish decision making
performance.

boundary in a field theory and, specifically, I applied this method to three
Topological Field Theories of the Shwartz type: the non-abelian Chern-Simons
model, the non-abelian three-dimensional BF theory and its abelian
four-dimensional version. This thesis is organized into three chapters. In
Chapter 1 the introduction of the boundary in the non-abelian CS model is
illustrated. The purpose of this chapter is to describe some techniques known
in literature, which are largely used in the following chapters. In Chapter 2
the three-dimensional non-abelian BF theory with a boundary is analyzed. The
most interesting result of this chapter is the interpretation of the boundary
term of the Ward Identities as the gauge-fixing for the residual gauge
invariance of the theory on the boundary. In Chapter 3 the techniques developed
in the previous chapters are applied to the abelian BF theory in four
space-time dimensions with a boundary. The most interesting result of this
chapter, (and of the entire thesis), is the characterization of the boundary
dynamics in terms of canonical commutation relations generated by the algebra
of local boundary observables, which exists due to the residual gauge
invariance of the bulk theory. The results obtained suggest that this model can
be considered as an effective theory for the (3+1)D Topological Insulators.

data such that the threshold is at $p=p_*$. Hence they conjecture that in
ultrarelavistic collisions almost all the kinetic energy can be converted into

a toy model for the binary, they consider the geodesic motion of a test
particle in a Kerr black hole spacetime, where the unstable circular geodesics

$\gamma$. Here, we incorporate radiation reaction into this model using the

a sequence of unstable circular geodesic orbits under the effect of the
self-force. We confirm that almost all the initial energy and angular momentum

infinite initial energy, this happens over a finite number of orbits given by
$n_\infty\simeq 0.41/\eta$, where $\eta$ is the (small) mass ratio. We derive
expressions for the time spent on the critical solution, number of orbits and

Greicius' thesis, he develops necessary and sufficient criteria for determining
when this representation is actually surjective and exhibits such an example.
However, verifying these criteria turns out to be difficult in practice;
Greicius describes tests for them that apply only to semistable elliptic curves
over a specific class of cubic number fields. In this paper, we extend
Greicius' methods in several directions. First, we consider the analogous
problem for elliptic curves with full 2-torsion. Following Greicius, we obtain
necessary and sufficient conditions for the associated adelic representation to
be maximal and also develop a battery of computationally effective tests that
can be used to verify these conditions. We are able to use our tests to
construct an infinite family of curves over Q(alpha) with maximal image, where
alpha is the real root of x^3 + x + 1. Next, we extend Greicius' tests to more
general settings, such as non-semistable elliptic curves over arbitrary cubic
number fields. Finally, we give a general discussion concerning such problems
for arbitrary torsion subgroups.

suppressing the latter by a large spin current. The effect is similar to a
swing which may be set into high amplitude motion by a weak near-resonant push.

catalogue of ultraviolet (UV) sources detected serendipitously by the Optical
Monitor (XMM-OM) on-board the XMM-Newton observatory. The catalogue contains
ultraviolet-detected sources collected from 2,417 XMM-OM observations in 1-6
broad band UV and optical filters, made between 24 February 2000 and 29 March
2007. The primary contents of the catalogue are source positions, magnitudes
and fluxes in 1 to 6 passbands, and these are accompanied by profile
diagnostics and variability statistics. The XMM-SUSS is populated by 753,578 UV
source detections above a 3 sigma signal-to-noise threshold limit which relate
to 624,049 unique objects. Taking account of substantial overlaps between
observations, the net sky area covered is 29-54 square degrees, depending on UV
filter. The magnitude distributions peak at 20.2, 20.9 and 21.2 in UVW2, UVM2
and UVW1 respectively. More than 10 per cent of sources have been visited more
than once using the same filter during XMM-Newton operation, and > 20 per cent
of sources are observed more than once per filter during an individual visit.
Consequently, the scope for science based on temporal source variability on
timescales of hours to years is broad. By comparison with other astrophysical
catalogues we test the accuracy of the source measurements and define the
nature of the serendipitous UV XMM-OM source sample. The distributions of
source colours in the UV and optical filters are shown together with the
expected loci of stars and galaxies, and indicate that sources which are
detected in multiple UV bands are predominantly star-forming galaxies and stars
of type G or earlier.

fields in biology by enabling the fast and cheap sequencing of large amounts of
genomic data. The ever increasing sequencing capacities enabled by current
sequencing machines hold a lot of promise as for the future applications of
these technologies, but also create increasing computational challenges related
to the analysis and storage of these data. A typical sequencing data file may
occupy tens or even hundreds of gigabytes of disk space, prohibitively large
for many users. Raw sequencing data consists of both the DNA sequences (reads)
and per-base quality values that indicate the level of confidence in the
readout of these sequences. Quality values account for about half of the
required disk space in the commonly used FASTQ format and therefore their
compression can significantly reduce storage requirements and speed up analysis
and transmission of these data.
  Results: In this paper we present a framework for the lossy compression of
the quality value sequences of genomic read files. Numerical experiments with
reference based alignment using these quality values suggest that we can
achieve significant compression with little compromise in performance for
several downstream applications of interest, as is consistent with our
theoretical analysis. Our framework also allows compression in a regime - below
one bit per quality value - for which there are no existing compressors.

of quark matter nucleation during the formation of compact stellar objects,
because it determines the nucleation rate and the associated critical size.
However, this quantity is not well known and the theoretical estimates fall
within a wide range, $\gamma_0 \approx 5-300 MeV/fm^2$. We show here that once
the equation of state is available one may use a geometrical approach to obtain
a numerical value for the surface tension that is consistent with the model
approximations adopted. We illustrate this method within the two-flavor linear
\sigma model and the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with two and three flavors.
Treating these models in the mean-field approximation, we find $\gamma_0
\approx 7-30 MeV/fm^2$. Such a relatively small surface tension would favor the
formation of quark stars and may thus have significant astrophysical
implications. We also investigate how the surface tension decreases towards
zero as the temperature is raised from zero to its critical value.

each two-electron spin system in a partially entangled state can be

the total success probability if the cavity is imperfect. The whole protocol
can be repeated to get a higher success probability. With the feasible

hitters algorithm [CCF02]. Count-Sketch uses O(k log n) linear measurements of
a vector x in R^n to give an estimate x' of x. The standard analysis shows that
this estimate x' satisfies ||x'-x||_infty^2 < ||x_tail||_2^2 / k, where x_tail
is the vector containing all but the largest k coordinates of x. Our main
result is that most of the coordinates of x' have substantially less error than
this upper bound; namely, for any c < O(log n), we show that each coordinate i
satisfies (x'_i - x_i)^2 < (c/log n) ||x_tail||_2^2/k with probability
1-2^{-Omega(c)}, as long as the hash functions are fully independent. This
subsumes the previous bound and is optimal for all c. Using these improved
point estimates, we prove a stronger concentration result for set estimates by
first analyzing the covariance matrix and then using a
median-of-median-of-medians argument to bootstrap the failure probability
bounds. These results also give improved results for l_2 recovery of exactly
k-sparse estimates x^* when x is drawn from a distribution with suitable decay,
such as a power law or lognormal. We complement our results with simulations of
Count-Sketch on a power law distribution. The empirical evidence indicates that
our theoretical bounds give a precise characterization of the algorithm's
performance: the asymptotics are correct and the associated constants are
small. Our proof shows that any symmetric random variable with finite variance
and positive Fourier transform concentrates around 0 at least as well as a
Gaussian. This result, which may be of independent interest, gives good
concentration even when the noise does not converge to a Gaussian.

microscopy (CP-AFM), both as function of temperature (248 - 373K) and of

we find that the ETp mechanism can alter with a change in the force applied via
the tip to the proteins. As the applied force increases, ETp via Az changes
from temperature-independent to thermally activated at high temperatures. This
is in contrast to the Cu-depleted form of Az (apo-Az), where increasing the
applied force causes only small quantitative effects, that fit with a decrease
in electrode spacing. At low force ETp via holo-Az is temperature-independent
and thermally activated via apo-Az. This observation agrees with
macroscopic-scale measurements, thus confirming that the difference in ETp
dependence on temperature between holo- and apo-Az is an inherent one that may
reflect a difference in rigidity between the two forms. An important
implication of these results, which depend on CP-AFM measurements over a
significant temperature range, is that for ETp measurements on floppy systems,
such as proteins, the stress applied to the sample should be kept constant or,

surprising lack of temperature-dependence for ETp via the blue copper protein
azurin (Az), from 80K till denaturation, while ETp via apo-(Cu-free) Az was
found to be temperature de-pendent \geq 200K. H/D substitution (deuteration)
can provide a potentially powerful means to unravel factors that affect the ETp
mechanism at a molecular level. Therefore, we measured and report here the
kinetic deuterium isotope effect (KIE) on ETp through holo-Az as a function of
temperature (30-340K). We find that deuteration has a striking effect in that
it changes ETp from temperature independent to temperature dependent above
180K. This change is expressed in KIE values between 1.8 at 340K and 9.1 at
\leq 180K. These values are particularly remarkable in light of the previously
reported inverse KIE on the ET in Az in solution. The high values that we
obtain for the KIE on the ETp process across the protein monolayer are
consistent with a transport mechanism that involves
through-(H-containing)-bonds of the {\beta}-sheet structure of Az, likely those
of am-ide groups.

three RA molecules to HSA and indications for their relative structural
positions. The temperature dependence of ETp shows that both the activation

190K to temperature-independent ETp below this temperature suggests a change in
the ETp mechanism with temperature.

with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), when improper or circularly
asymmetric complex Gaussian signaling is applied. For the Gaussian
multiple-input multiple-output interference channel (MIMO-IC) with the
interference treated as Gaussian noise, we show that the user's achievable rate
can be expressed as a summation of the rate achievable by the conventional
proper or circularly symmetric complex Gaussian signaling in terms of the
users' transmit covariance matrices, and an additional term, which is a
function of both the users' transmit covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices.
The additional degrees of freedom in the pseudo-covariance matrix, which is
conventionally set to be zero for the case of proper Gaussian signaling,
provide an opportunity to further improve the achievable rates of Gaussian
MIMO-ICs by employing improper Gaussian signaling. To this end, this paper
proposes widely linear precoding, which efficiently maps proper
information-bearing signals to improper transmitted signals at each transmitter
for any given pair of transmit covariance and pseudo-covariance matrices. In
particular, for the case of two-user Gaussian single-input single-output
interference channel (SISO-IC), we propose a joint covariance and
pseudo-covariance optimization algorithm with improper Gaussian signaling to
achieve the Pareto-optimal rates. By utilizing the separable structure of the
achievable rate expression, an alternative algorithm with separate covariance
and pseudo-covariance optimization is also proposed, which guarantees the rate
improvement over conventional proper Gaussian signaling.

of Science. Multi-armed bandit problems formalize this dilemma in its canonical
form. Most current research in this field focuses on generic solutions that can
be applied to a wide range of problems. However, in practice, it is often the
case that a form of prior information is available about the specific class of
target problems. Prior knowledge is rarely used in current solutions due to the
lack of a systematic approach to incorporate it into the E/E strategy.
  To address a specific class of E/E problems, we propose to proceed in three
steps: (i) model prior knowledge in the form of a probability distribution over
the target class of E/E problems; (ii) choose a large hypothesis space of
candidate E/E strategies; and (iii), solve an optimization problem to find a
candidate E/E strategy of maximal average performance over a sample of problems
drawn from the prior distribution.
  We illustrate this meta-learning approach with two different hypothesis
spaces: one where E/E strategies are numerically parameterized and another
where E/E strategies are represented as small symbolic formulas. We propose
appropriate optimization algorithms for both cases. Our experiments, with
two-armed Bernoulli bandit problems and various playing budgets, show that the
meta-learnt E/E strategies outperform generic strategies of the literature
(UCB1, UCB1-Tuned, UCB-v, KL-UCB and epsilon greedy); they also evaluate the
robustness of the learnt E/E strategies, by tests carried out on arms whose
rewards follow a truncated Gaussian distribution.

distributed algorithms for these problems compared to the classical setting.
  In order to obtain this result, we extend the technique of Das Sarma et al.
[SICOMP 2012] to obtain a uniform approach to prove non-trivial lower bounds
for quantum distributed algorithms for several graph optimization (both exact
and approximate versions) as well as verification problems, some of which are
new even in the classical setting, e.g. tight randomized lower bounds for
Hamiltonian cycle and spanning tree verification, answering an open problem of
Das Sarma et al., and a lower bound in terms of the weight aspect ratio,
matching the upper bounds of Elkin [STOC 2004]. Our approach introduces the
{\em Server model} and {\em Quantum Simulation Theorem} which together provide
a connection between distributed algorithms and communication complexity. The
Server model is the standard two-party communication complexity model augmented
with additional power; yet, most of the hardness in the two-party model is
carried over to this new model. The Quantum Simulation Theorem carries this
hardness further to quantum distributed computing. Our techniques, except the
proof of the hardness in the Server model, require very little knowledge in
quantum computing, and this can help overcoming a usual impediment in proving
bounds on quantum distributed algorithms.

improved if we remove some edges from the network. This counterintuitive fact,
widely known as Braess's paradox, gives rise to the (selfish) network design
problem, where we seek to recognize routing games suffering from the paradox,
and to improve the equilibrium performance by edge removal. In this work, we
investigate the computational complexity and the approximability of the network
design problem for non-atomic bottleneck routing games, where the individual
cost of each player is the bottleneck cost of her path, and the social cost is
the bottleneck cost of the network. We first show that bottleneck routing games
do not suffer from Braess's paradox either if the network is series-parallel,
or if we consider only subpath-optimal Nash flows. On the negative side, we
prove that even for games with strictly increasing linear latencies, it is
NP-hard not only to recognize instances suffering from the paradox, but also to
distinguish between instances for which the Price of Anarchy (PoA) can decrease
to 1 and instances for which the PoA is as large as \Omega(n^{0.121}) and
cannot improve by edge removal. Thus, the network design problem for such games
is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of O(n^{0.121-\eps}), for any
constant \eps > 0. On the positive side, we show how to compute an almost
optimal subnetwork w.r.t. the bottleneck cost of its worst Nash flow, when the
worst Nash flow in the best subnetwork routes a non-negligible amount of flow
on all used edges. The running time is determined by the total number of paths,
and is quasipolynomial when the number of paths is quasipolynomial.

hypothesis, first proposed in Coleman et al. (2004), that the Fornax dwarf
galaxy was formed from the minor merging of two dwarfs about 2 Gyr ago. Using
orbits for the Fornax dwarf that are consistent with the latest proper motion
measurements, our dynamical evolution models show that the observed asymmetric
shell-like substructures can be formed from the remnant of a smaller dwarf
during minor merging. These models also predict the formation of diffuse
stellar streams. We discuss how these stellar substructures depend on model
parameters of dwarf-dwarf merging, and how the intermediate-age subpopulations
found in the vicinity of these substructures may be formed from gas accretion
in the past merger events. We also suggest that one of Fornax's GCs originates
from a merged dwarf companion, and demonstrate where as yet undetected tidal
streams or HI gas formed from the dwarf merging may be found in the outer halo
of the Galaxy.

of $U_l}$ such that the elements of PMNS matrix, finally yield
$\sin\theta_{13}\neq 0$ and $\tan^2\theta_{23}<1$. To compute the values of
mixing angles we assume the charged lepton correction to be of CKM-like. All
the mixing matrices considered here satisfy the unitarity condition to leading

minimum Doppler factor and energy content of the gamma-ray emitting region of
quasar 3C 279, using a standard proton synchrotron blazar model and the
principles of automatic photon quenching. The latter becomes relevant for high
enough magnetic fields and results in spontaneous annihilation of gamma-rays.
The absorbed energy is then redistributed into electron-positron pairs and soft
radiation. We show that as quenching sets an upper value for the source
rest-frame gamma-ray luminosity, one has, by neccessity, to resort to Doppler
factors that lie above a certain value in order to explain the TeV
observations. The existence of this lower limit for the Doppler factor has also
implications on the energetics of the emitting region. In this aspect, the
proposed method can be regarded as an extension of the widely used one for
estimating the equipartition magnetic field using radio observations. In our
case, the leptonic synchrotron component is replaced by the proton synchrotron
emission and the radio by the VHE gamma-ray observations. We show specifically
that one can model the TeV observations by using parameter values that minimize
both the energy density and the jet power at the cost of high-values of the
Doppler factor. On the other hand, the modelling can also be done by using the
minimum possible Doppler factor; this, however, leads to a particle dominated
region and high jet power for a wide range of magnetic field values. Despite
the fact that we have focused on the case of 3C 279, our analysis can be of
relevance to all TeV blazars favoring hadronic modelling that have, moreover,
simultaneous X-ray observations.

description of the internal dynamics of dressed elementary particles and

interdependent fields satisfying coupled quantum field equations, all expressed
at the same space-time coordinate. Quantization is realized by expanding the
quantum fields in terms of fermionic creation and annihilation operators. This
approach is applied in a QCD description of the light quarks with a zero Higgs
field. Originally massless and pointlike, an isolated quark (described in its
own center-of-mass) acquires mass and a finite extent when treated as an
interacting system of quark and gluon fields. The binding mechanism of this
localized system has a topological character, being a consequence of the
non-linear nature of QCD, while being insensitive to the magnitude of the
coupling constant to lowest order. To prevent this system from collapsing
general relativity is introduced. The quark stabilizes at a radius of 8.8
Planck lengths and acquires a mass of 3.2 MeV, in remarkable agreement with
