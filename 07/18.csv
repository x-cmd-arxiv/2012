radio, optical, and ultraviolet regimes. Of the 365 galaxies in this sample, 80
have been detected in HI by the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA survey. These
detections include 12 early-type dwarfs which have HI and stellar masses
similar to the cluster dwarf irregulars and BCDs. In this sample of 12, half
have star-formation properties similar to late type dwarfs, while the other
half are quiescent like typical early-type dwarfs. We also discuss three
possible mechanisms for their evolution: that they are infalling field galaxies
that have been or are currently being evolved by the cluster, that they are
stripped objects whose gas is recycled, and that the observed HI has been
recently reaccreted. Evolution by the cluster adequately explains the
star-forming half of the sample, but the quiescent class of early-type dwarfs
is most consistent with having recently reaccreted their gas.

observed at the Pierre Auger Observatory (PAO) with energies exceeding 55 EeV.
We investigate whether the UHECRs exhibit the anisotropy signal expected if the
primary particles are protons that originate in galaxies in the local universe,
or in sources correlated with these galaxies. We cross-correlate the UHECR
arrival directions with the positions of IRAS-PSCz and 2MASS-6dF galaxies
taking into account particle energy losses during propagation. This is the
first time that the 6dF survey is used in a search for the sources of UHECRs
and the first time that the PSCz survey is used with the full 69 PAO events.
The observed cross-correlation signal is larger for the PAO UHECRs than for 94%
(98%) of realisations from an isotropic distribution when cross-correlated with
the PSCz (6dF). On the other hand the observed cross-correlation signal is
lower than that expected from 85% of realisations, had the UHECRs originated in
galaxies in either survey. The observed cross-correlation signal does exceed
that expected by 50% of the realisations if the UHECRs are randomly deflected
by intervening magnetic fields by 5 degrees or more. We propose a new method of
analysing the expected anisotropy signal, by dividing the predicted UHECR
source distribution into equal predicted flux radial shells, which can help
localise and constrain the properties of UHECR sources. We find that the 69 PAO
events are consistent with isotropy in the nearest of three shells we define,
whereas there is weak evidence for correlation with the predicted source
distribution in the two more distant shells in which the galaxy distribution is
less anisotropic.

system in which users share a resource, but outcomes depend on the information
held and actions taken by users. If communication is possible, the manager can
ask users to report their private information and then, using this information,
instruct them on what actions they should take. If the users are compliant,
this reduces the manager's optimization problem to a well-studied problem of
optimal control. However, if the users are self-interested and not compliant,
the problem is much more complicated: when asked to report their private
information, the users might lie; upon receiving instructions, the users might
disobey. Here we ask whether the manager can design the system to get around
both of these difficulties. To do so, the manager must provide for the users
the incentives to report truthfully and to follow the instructions, despite the
fact that the users are self-interested. For a class of environments that
includes many resource allocation games in communication networks, we provide
tools for the manager to design an efficient system. In addition to reports and
recommendations, the design we employ allows the manager to intervene in the
system after the users take actions. In an abstracted environment, we find
conditions under which the manager can achieve the same outcome it could if
users were compliant, and conditions under which it does not. We then apply our
framework and results to design a flow control management system.

Planck satellite, we study the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) and pressure profiles of
62 nearby massive clusters detected at high significance in the 14-month
nominal survey. Careful reconstruction of the SZ signal indicates that most
clusters are individually detected at least out to R500. By stacking the radial
profiles, we have statistically detected the radial SZ signal out to 3 x R500,
i.e., at a density contrast of about 50-100, though the dispersion about the
mean profile dominates the statistical errors across the whole radial range.
Our measurement is fully consistent with previous Planck results on integrated
SZ fluxes, further strengthening the agreement between SZ and X-ray
measurements inside R500. Correcting for the effects of the Planck beam, we
have calculated the corresponding pressure profiles. This new constraint from
SZ measurements is consistent with the X-ray constraints from XMM-Newton in the
region in which the profiles overlap (i.e., [0.1-1]R500), and is in fairly good
agreement with theoretical predictions within the expected dispersion. At
larger radii the average pressure profile is slightly flatter than most
predictions from numerical simulations. Combining the SZ and X-ray observed
profiles into a joint fit to a generalised pressure profile gives best-fit
parameters [P0, c500, gamma, alpha, beta] = [6.41, 1.81, 0.31, 1.33, 4.13].
Using a reasonable hypothesis for the gas temperature in the cluster outskirts
we reconstruct from our stacked pressure profile the gas mass fraction profile
out to 3 x R500. Within the temperature driven uncertainties, our Planck
constraints are compatible with the cosmic baryon fraction and expected gas
fraction in halos.

problems, namely randomized contractions. We apply our framework to obtain the
first FPT algorithm for the Unique Label Cover problem and new FPT algorithms
with exponential speed up for the Steiner Cut and Node Multiway Cut-Uncut
problems. More precisely, we show the following:
  - We prove that the parameterized version of the Unique Label Cover problem,
which is the base of the Unique Games Conjecture, can be solved in 2^{O(k^2\log
|\Sigma|)}n^4\log n deterministic time (even in the stronger, vertex-deletion
variant) where k is the number of unsatisfied edges and |\Sigma| is the size of
the alphabet. As a consequence, we show that one can in polynomial time solve
instances of Unique Games where the number of edges allowed not to be satisfied
is upper bounded by O(\sqrt{\log n}) to optimality, which improves over the
trivial O(1) upper bound.
  - We prove that the Steiner Cut problem can be solved in 2^{O(k^2\log
k)}n^4\log n deterministic time and \tilde{O}(2^{O(k^2\log k)}n^2) randomized
time where k is the size of the cutset. This result improves the double
exponential running time of the recent work of Kawarabayashi and Thorup
(FOCS'11).
  - We show how to combine considering `cut' and `uncut' constraints at the
same time. More precisely, we define a robust problem Node Multiway Cut-Uncut
that can serve as an abstraction of introducing uncut constraints, and show
that it admits an algorithm running in 2^{O(k^2\log k)}n^4\log n deterministic
time where k is the size of the cutset. To the best of our knowledge, the only
known way of tackling uncut constraints was via the approach of Marx,
O'Sullivan and Razgon (STACS'10), which yields algorithms with double
exponential running time.
  An interesting aspect of our technique is that, unlike important separators,
it can handle real weights.

Gabriel graph and is motivated by applications in wireless networks. Unlike a
Gabriel graph, there is no unique locally Gabriel graph on a given point set

Thus the edge set of the graph can be customized to optimize certain network
parameters depending on the application. In this paper, we show the following
combinatorial bounds on edge complexity and independent sets of locally Gabriel
graphs:
  (i) For any $n$, there exists locally Gabriel graphs with $\Omega(n^{5/4})$
edges. This improves upon the previous best bound of $\Omega(n^{1+\frac{1}{\log

  (ii) For various subclasses of convex point sets, we show tight linear bounds

hoc network with a finite number of mobiles and finite spatial extent. The
mobiles communicate using coded continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK)
modulation. The performance of the system is a function of the number of
hopping channels, the rate of the error-correction code, and the modulation
index used by the CPFSK modulation. For a given channel model and density of
mobiles, these parameters are jointly optimized by maximizing the
(modulation-constrained) transmission capacity, which is a measure of the
spatial spectral efficiency of the system. The transmission capacity of the
finite network is found by using a recent expression for the spatially averaged
outage probability in the presence of Nakagami fading, which is found in closed

  Our result follows from a novel application of differential privacy. We show
that any algorithm that computes a correlated equilibrium of a complete

call joint differential privacy---can be used as a recommender mechanism while
satisfying our desired incentive properties. Our main technical result is an
algorithm for computing a correlated equilibrium of a large game while

No group of players can learn ""much"" about the type of any player outside the

usually fixed on symmetry or phenomenology grounds. We verify that the

While quadratic divergences are welcome for instance in effective models of low
energy QCD, they pose a problem in the SM treated as an effective theory in the
Higgs sector. Being the very existence of quadratic divergences a matter of
debate, a plausible scenario is to search for a symmetry requirement that could
fix the arbitrary coefficient of the leading quadratic behavior to the Higgs
boson mass to zero. We show that this is possible employing consistency of
scale symmetry breaking by quantum corrections. Besides eliminating a
fine-tuning problem and restoring validity of perturbation theory, this
requirement allows to construct bounds for the Higgs boson mass in terms of
$\delta m^2/m^2_H$ (where $m_H$ is the renormalized Higgs mass and $\delta m^2$
is the 1-loop Higgs mass correction). Whereas $\delta m^2/m^2_H<1$
(perturbative regime) in this scenario allows the Higgs boson mass around the
current accepted value, the inclusion of the quadratic divergence demands
$\delta m^2/m^2_H$ arbitrarily large to reach that experimental value.

smaller than previously thought, greatly reducing the formation time of the
bubbles to about a Myr. This relatively small bubble age is needed to reconcile
the simulations with the upper limit of bubbles ages estimated from the cooling
time of high-energy electrons. No additional physical mechanisms are required
to suppress large-scale hydrodynamic instabilities because the evolution time
is too short for them to develop. The simulated CR bubbles are edge-brightened,
which is consistent with the observed projected flat surface brightness
distribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the sharp edges of the observed

drape around the bubbles during their supersonic expansion, with suppressed
perpendicular diffusion across the bubble surface. Possible causes of the

what is expected for galaxies of near-solar metallicity. Our derived dust
masses are larger (by up to a factor 3) than estimates based on
single-temperature modified blackbody fits. We show that the SED fits are
significantly improved if the starlight intensity distribution includes a

large reservoirs of hidden j_* from AM transport in major mergers. We carry out
a j_*-M_* analysis of literature data for ~100 nearby bright galaxies of all
types. The Es and spirals form parallel j_*-M_* tracks, which for spirals is
like the Tully-Fisher relation, but for Es derives from a mass-size-rotation
conspiracy. The Es contain ~3-4 times less AM than equal-mass spirals. We
decompose the spirals into disks+bulges and find similar j_*-M_* trends to
spirals and Es overall. The S0s are intermediate, and we propose that
morphological types reflect disk/bulge subcomponents following separate j_*-M_*
scaling relations -- providing a physical motivation for characterizing
galaxies by mass and bulge/disk ratio. Next, we construct idealized
cosmological models of AM content, using a priori estimates of dark matter halo
spin and mass. We find that the scatter in halo spin cannot explain the
spiral/E j_* differences, but the data are matched if the galaxies retained
different fractions of initial j (~60% and ~10%). We consider physical
mechanisms for j_* and M_* evolution (outflows, stripping, collapse bias,
merging), emphasizing that the vector sum of such processes must produce the

quantify the effects of secular evolution on black hole growth, we study a
sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in galaxies with a calm formation
history free of significant mergers, a population that heretofore has been
difficult to locate. Here we present an initial sample of 13 AGN in massive
(M_* >~ 1e10 M_sun) bulgeless galaxies -- which lack the classical bulges
believed inevitably to result from mergers -- selected from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey using visual classifications from Galaxy Zoo. Parametric
morphological fitting confirms the host galaxies lack classical bulges; any
contributions from pseudobulges are very small (typically < 5%). We compute
black hole masses for the two broad-line objects in the sample (4.2e6 and 1.2e7
M_sun) and place lower limits on black hole masses for the remaining sample
(typically M_BH >~ 1e6 M_sun), showing that significant black hole growth must
be possible in the absence of mergers or violent disk instabilities.
  The black hole masses are systematically higher than expected from
established bulge-black hole relations. However, if the mean Eddington ratio of
the systems with measured black hole masses (L/L_Edd = 0.065) is typical, 10 of
13 sources are consistent with the correlation between black hole mass and
total stellar mass. That pure disk galaxies and their central black holes may
be consistent with a relation derived from elliptical and bulge-dominated
galaxies with very different formation histories implies the details of stellar
galaxy evolution and dynamics may not be fundamental to the co-evolution of
galaxies and black holes.

that, at fixed stellar mass, galaxies with lower gas fractions typically also

Although some cluster galaxies are gas-deficient objects, statistically the

variations (TTV) are near first-order mean-motion resonances. We derive
analytical formulae for their TTV signals. We separate planet eccentricity into
free and forced parts, where the forced part is purely due to the planets'
proximity to resonance. This separation yields simple analytical formulae. The
phase of the TTV depends sensitively on the presence of free eccentricity: if
the free eccentricity vanishes, the TTV will be in phase with the longitude of
conjunctions. This effect is easily detectable in current TTV data. The
amplitude of the TTV depends on planet mass and free eccentricity, and it
determines planet mass uniquely only when the free eccentricity is sufficiently
small. We proceed to analyze the TTV signals of six short period Kepler pairs.
We find that three of these pairs (Kepler-18,24,25) have TTV phase consistent
with zero. The other three (Kepler-23,28,32) have small TTV phases, but ones
that are distinctly non-zero. We deduce that the free eccentricities of the
planets are small, < 0.01, but not always vanishing. Furthermore, as a
consequence of this, we deduce that the true masses of the planets are fairly
accurately determined by the TTV amplitudes, within a factor < 2. The smallness
of the free eccentricities suggests that the planets have experienced
substantial dissipation. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the
observed pile-up of Kepler pairs near mean-motion resonances is caused by
resonant repulsion. But the fact that some of the planets have non-vanishing
free eccentricity suggests that after resonant repulsion occurred there was a
subsequent phase in the planets' evolution when their eccentricities were
modestly excited, perhaps by interplanetary interactions.

flavor-violating processes. The synergy between these two approaches requires a
direct measurement of the heavy neutrino couplings. We discuss a strategy to
perform such measurements at the LHC in the context of left-right symmetric
models, which is also applicable to other models implementing a type-I or
type-III seesaw. We demonstrate that the ambiguities in the determination of
the heavy neutrino mixing parameters can be resolved by performing an exclusive

dynamically 'hot' at z>2 which may instead favor the formation of
commonly-observed clumpy structures. Alternatively, current instrumentation may
simply not be sensitive enough to detect spiral structures comparable to those

decreases, and spiral galaxies are more numerous by z~1. Here we report
observations of the grand design spiral galaxy Q2343-BX442 at z=2.18.
Spectroscopy of ionized gas shows that the disk is dynamically hot, implying an
uncertain origin for the spiral structure. The kinematics of the galaxy are
consistent with a thick disk undergoing a minor merger, which can drive the
formation of short-lived spiral structure. A duty cycle of < 100 Myr for such
tidally-induced spiral structure in a hot massive disk is consistent with their

hadronic calorimeter is studied using charged pions with energies from 10 GeV
to 80 GeV at the CERN SPS. The energy resolution for single hadrons is
determined to be approximately 58%/sqrt(E/GeV}. This resolution is improved to
approximately 45%/sqrt(E/GeV) with software compensation techniques. These
techniques take advantage of the event-by-event information about the
substructure of hadronic showers which is provided by the imaging capabilities
of the calorimeter. The energy reconstruction is improved either with
corrections based on the local energy density or by applying a single
correction factor to the event energy sum derived from a global measure of the
shower energy density. The application of the compensation algorithms to Geant4
simulations yield resolution improvements comparable to those observed for real
data.

individuals within a population, Delbr\""{u}ck-Gillespie process (DGP)
$n(t)\in\mathbb{Z}^N$, is a birth-death system with state-dependent rates which
contain the system size $V$ as a natural parameter. For large $V$, it is
intimately related to an autonomous, nonlinear ordinary differential equation
as well as a diffusion process. For nonlinear dynamical systems with multiple
attractors, the quasi-stationary and stationary behavior of such a birth-death
process can be underestood in terms of a separation of time scales by a
$T^*\sim e^{\alpha V}$ $(\alpha>0)$: a relatively fast, intra-basin diffusion
for $t\ll T^*$ and a much slower inter-basin Markov jump process for $t\gg
T^*$. In the present paper for one-dimensional systems, we study both
stationary behavior ($t=\infty$) in terms of invariant distribution
$p_n^{ss}(V)$, and finite time dynamics in terms of the mean first passsage
time (MFPT) $T_{n_1\rightarrow n_2}(V)$. We obtain an asymptotic expression of
MFPT in terms of the ""stochastic potential"" $\Phi(x,V)=-(1/V)\ln
p^{ss}_{xV}(V)$. We show in general no continuous diffusion process can provide
asymptotically accurate representations for both the MFPT and the $p_n^{ss}(V)$
for a DGP. When $n_1$ and $n_2$ belong to two different basins of attraction,
the MFPT yields the $T^*(V)$ in terms of $\Phi(x,V)\approx
\phi_0(x)+(1/V)\phi_1(x)$. For systems with a saddle-node bifurcation and
catastrophe, discontinuous ""phase transition"" emerges, which can be
characterized by $\Phi(x,V)$ in the limit of $V\rightarrow\infty$. In terms of
time scale separation, the relation between deterministic, local nonlinear
bifurcations and stochastic global phase transition is discussed. The
one-dimensional theory is a pedagogic first step toward a general theory of
DGP.

situations where the methods of Wiles and Taylor--Wiles do not apply. Previous
generalizations of these methods have been restricted to situations where the
automorphic forms in question contribute to a single degree of cohomology. In
practice, this imposes several restrictions -- one must be in a Shimura variety
setting and the automorphic forms must be of regular weight at infinity. In
this paper, we essentially show how to remove these restrictions.
  Our most general result is a modularity lifting theorem which, on the
automorphic side applies to automorphic forms on the group GL(n) over a general
number field; it is contingent on a conjecture which, in particular, predicts
the existence of Galois representations associated to torsion classes in the
cohomology of the associated locally symmetric space. We show that if this
conjecture holds, then our main theorem implies the following: if E is an
elliptic curve over an arbitrary number field, then E is potentially
automorphic and satisfies the Sato--Tate conjecture.
  In addition, we also prove some unconditional results. For example, in the
setting of GL(2) over Q, we identify certain minimal global deformation rings
with the Hecke algebras acting on spaces of p-adic Katz modular forms of weight
one. Such algebras may well contain p-torsion. Moreover, we also completely
solved the problem (for p odd) of determining the multiplicity of an
irreducible modular representation rhobar in the Jacobian J_1(N), where N is
the minimal level such that rhobar arises in weight two.

contract): Aklim mountain in Morocco, Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos
(ORM) in Spain, Mac\'on range in Argentina, and Cerro Ventarrones in Chile. The
same techniques, instruments and acquisition procedures were taken on each
site. A Multiple Aperture Scintillation Sensor (MASS) and a Differential Image
Motion Monitor (DIMM) were installed at each site. Global statistics of the
integrated seeing, the free atmosphere seeing, the boundary layer seeing and
the isoplanatic angle were studied for each site, and the results are presented
here. In order to estimate other important parameters such as the coherence
time of the wavefront and the overall parameter ""coherence \'etendue""
additional information of vertical profiles of the wind speed was needed. Data
were retrieved from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
archive. Ground wind speed was measured by Automatic Weather Stations (AWS).
More aspects of the turbulence parameters such as their seasonal trend, their
nightly evolution and their temporal stability were also obtained and analyzed.

applicable to particles with or without mass in astrophysical settings. Derived
from first principles, the formulation is manifestly covariant. Absorption and
emission, as well as relativistic, geometrical and optical depth effects are
treated self-consistently. The RT formulation can handle 3D geometrical
settings and structured objects with variations and gradients in the optical
depths across the objects and along the line-of-sight. The presence of mass
causes the intensity variation along the particle bundle ray to be reduced by
an aberration factor. We apply the formulation and demonstrate RT calculations
for emission from accretion tori around rotating black holes, considering two
cases: idealised optically thick tori that have a sharply defined emission
boundary surface, and structured tori that allow variations in the absorption
coefficient and emissivity within the tori. Intensity images and emission
spectra of these tori are calculated. Geometrical effects, such as
lensing-induced self-occulation and multiple-image contribution are far more
significant in accretion tori than geometrically thin accretion disks.
Optically thin accretion tori emission line profiles are distinguishable from
the profiles of lines from optically thick accretion tori and optically thick
geometrically thin accretion disks. Line profiles of optically thin accretion
tori have a weaker dependence on viewing inclination angle than those of the
optically thick accretion tori or accretion disks, especially at high viewing
inclination angles. Limb effects are present in accretion tori with finite
optical depths. Finally, in accretion flows onto relativistic compact objects,
gravitationally induced line resonance can occur. This resonance occurs easily
in 3D flows, but not in 2D flows, such as a thin accretion disk around a black
hole.

0.5, is structurally related to YBa2Cu3O7 in which 25% of the basal Cu cations
[i.e. those in the chain layer] are replaced by Mo, and the Ba cations are
replaced by Sr. After oxidation under high pressure the s = 1 member becomes
superconducting with Tc = 88K. The Cu valence is estimated to be ~2.5, well
beyond the ~2.3 value for which other High-Tc cuprates are considered to be
overdoped Fermi liquids. The increase in valence is attributed to the
additional 0.5 oxygen ions added per chain upon oxidation. The record short
apical oxygen distance, at odds with current theory, suggests the possibility
of a new pairing mechanism but further experiments are urgently needed to
obtain more direct evidence. From the structural point of view the members with
s \geq 2 are considered to be equivalent to single-layer cuprates. All have Tc
~ 56 K which is significantly higher than expected because they also have
higher than expected Cu valences. The XANES-determined valences normalized to
give values in the CuO2 layers are 2.24, 2.25, and 2.26 for s = 2, 3, and 4,
while the BVS values determined for the valence in the CuO2 layer alone are
2.31-2.34 for the s = 2 and 3 members. No evidence for periodic ordering has
been detected by electron diffraction and high resolution imaging studies. The
possibility that the charge reservoir layers are able to screen long range

high-frequency QNMs of Schwarzschild black holes and null geodesics that reside
on the light-ring : the real part of the mode's frequency relates to the
geodesic's orbital frequency, and the imaginary part of the frequency
corresponds to the Lyapunov exponent of the orbit. For slowly rotating black
holes, the QNM real frequency is a linear combination of a the orbit's
precessional and orbital frequencies, but the correspondence is otherwise
unchanged. In this paper, we find a relationship between the QNM frequencies of
Kerr black holes of arbitrary (astrophysical) spins and general spherical
photon orbits, which is analogous to the relationship for slowly rotating
holes. To derive this result, we first use the WKB approximation to compute
accurate algebraic expressions for large-l QNM frequencies. Comparing our WKB
calculation to the leading-order, geometric-optics approximation to scalar-wave
propagation in the Kerr spacetime, we then draw a correspondence between the
real parts of the parameters of a QNM and the conserved quantities of spherical
photon orbits. At next-to-leading order in this comparison, we relate the
imaginary parts of the QNM parameters to coefficients that modify the amplitude
of the scalar wave. With this correspondence, we find a geometric
interpretation to two features of the QNM spectrum of Kerr black holes: First,
for Kerr holes rotating near the maximal rate, a large number of modes have
nearly zero damping; we connect this characteristic to the fact that a large
number of spherical photon orbits approach the horizon in this limit. Second,
for black holes of any spins, the frequencies of specific sets of modes are
degenerate; we find that this feature arises when the spherical photon orbits
corresponding to these modes form closed (as opposed to ergodically winding)
curves.

that the game has multiple equilibria, which, after the equilibrium refinement

arbitrary two dimensional region with Neumann boundary condition. The basic
idea is to solve the original Poisson problem by a two-step procedure: the
first one finds the electric displacement field $\mathbf{D}$ and the second one
involves the solution of potential $\phi$. The first step exploits loop-tree
decomposition technique that has been applied widely in integral equations
within the computational electromagnetics (CEM) community. We expand the
electric displacement field in terms of a tree basis. Then, coefficients of the
tree basis can be found by the fast tree solver in O(N) operations. Such
obtained solution, however, fails to expand the exact field because the tree
basis is not completely curl free. Despite of this, the accurate field could be
retrieved by carrying out a procedure of divergence free field removal.
Subsequently, potential distribution $\phi$ can be found rapidly at the second
stage with another fast approach of O(N) complexity. As a result, the method
dramatically reduces solution time comparing with traditional FEM with
iterative method. Numerical examples including electrostatic simulations are
presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

the mass of the protoplanet is $M_p \lesssim 33M_\oplus$, where $M_\oplus$ is
the Earth mass. However, effects of viscosity on the circumplanetary disk are
negligibly small when the mass of the protoplanet $M_p \gtrsim 33M_\oplus$. We
find that when $M_p \lesssim 33M_\oplus$, viscosity can disrupt the spiral
structure of the gas around the planet considerably and make the gas smoothly
distributed, which makes the torques exerted on the protoplanet weaker. Thus,
viscosity can make the migration speed of a protoplanet lower. After including
viscosity, size of the circumplanetary disk can be decreased by a factor of
$\gtrsim 20%$. Viscosity helps to transport gas into the circumplanetary disk
from the differentially rotating circumstellar disk. The mass of the
circumplanetary disk can be increased by a factor of 50% after viscosity is
taken into account when $M_p \lesssim 33M_\oplus$. Effects of viscosity on the

service that allows tracking indoor entities that do not carry any devices.
Previous work in DF WLAN localization focused on the tracking of a single
entity due to the intractability of the multi-entity tracking problem whose
complexity grows exponentially with the number of humans being tracked. In this
paper, we introduce Spot as an accurate and efficient system for multi-entity
DF detection and tracking. Spot is based on a probabilistic energy minimization
framework that combines a conditional random field with a Markov model to
capture the temporal and spatial relations between the entities' poses. A novel
cross-calibration technique is introduced to reduce the calibration overhead of
multiple entities to linear, regardless of the number of humans being tracked.
This also helps in increasing the system accuracy. We design the energy
minimization function with the goal of being efficiently solved in mind. We
show that the designed function can be mapped to a binary graph-cut problem
whose solution has a linear complexity on average and a third order polynomial
in the worst case. We further employ clustering on the estimated location
candidates to reduce outliers and obtain more accurate tracking. Experimental
evaluation in two typical testbeds, with a side-by-side comparison with the
state-of-the-art, shows that Spot can achieve a multi-entity tracking accuracy
of less than 1.1m. This corresponds to at least 36% enhancement in median
distance error over the state-of-the-art DF localization systems, which can
only track a single entity. In addition, Spot can estimate the number of
entities correctly to within one difference error. This highlights that Spot
achieves its goals of having an accurate and efficient software-only DF
tracking solution of multiple entities in indoor environments.

lensing through the measurements of their first and second order properties,
shear and flexion, is a powerful observational tool for investigating the true
shape of these profiles. One of the three-parameter density profiles recently
favoured in the description of dark matter haloes is the Einasto profile. We
present exact expressions for the shear and the first and second flexions of

different mass profiles including the singular isothermal sphere, the

If the
magneto-rotational instability (MRI) drives turbulence throughout the disc,
there is a unique snow line outside of which the disc is icy. The snow line
moves closer to the star as the infall accretion rate drops. Because the snow
line moves inside the radius of the Earth's orbit, the formation of our
water-devoid planet is difficult with this model. However, protoplanetary discs
are not likely to be sufficiently ionised to be fully turbulent. A dead zone at
the mid-plane slows the flow of material through the disc and a steady state
cannot be achieved. We therefore model the evolution of the snow line also in a
time-dependent disc with a dead zone. As the mass is accumulating, the outer
parts of the dead zone become self gravitating, heat the massive disc and thus
the outer snow line does not come inside the radius of the Earth's orbit,
contrary to the fully turbulent disc model. There is a second, inner icy
region, within the dead zone, that moves inwards of the Earth's orbit after a
time of about 10^6 yr. With this model there is sufficient time and mass in the
disc for the Earth to form from water-devoid planetesimals at a radius of 1 AU.
Furthermore, the additional inner icy region predicted by this model may allow
for the formation of giant planets close to their host star without the need
for much migration.

operation in a program, instruction by instruction. In such a setting, a
transfer function describes the semantics of a single instruction, detailing
how a given abstract input state is mapped to an abstract output state. The net
effect of a sequence of instructions, a basic block, can then be calculated by
composing the transfer functions of the constituent instructions. However,
precision can be improved by applying a single transfer function that captures
the semantics of the block as a whole. Since blocks are program-dependent, this
approach necessitates automation. There has thus been growing interest in
computing transfer functions automatically, most notably using techniques based
on quantifier elimination. Although conceptually elegant, quantifier
elimination inevitably induces a computational bottleneck, which limits the
applicability of these methods to small blocks. This paper contributes a method
for calculating transfer functions that finesses quantifier elimination
altogether, and can thus be seen as a response to this problem. The
practicality of the method is demonstrated by generating transfer functions for
input and output states that are described by linear template constraints,
which include intervals and octagons.

data one can obtain knowledge not only about the structure and characteristics
of the network but also gain understanding about semantic of human relations.
Are they direct or not? Do people tend to sustain single or multiple relations
with a given person? What types of communication is the most important for
them? Answers to these and more questions enable us to draw conclusions about
semantic of human interactions. Unfortunately, most of the methods used for
social network analysis (SNA) may be applied only to one-layered social
networks. Thus, some new structural measures for multi-layered social networks
are proposed in the paper, in particular: cross-layer clustering coefficient,
cross-layer degree centrality and various versions of multi-layered degree
centralities. Authors also investigated the dynamics of multi-layered
neighbourhood for five different layers within the social network. The
evaluation of the presented concepts on the real-world dataset is presented.
The measures proposed in the paper may directly be used to various methods for
collective classification, in which nodes are assigned to labels according to
their structural input features.

variation of the oxygen isotope exponent (IE) with the number of doped holes,
p, in the CuO2 planes has been a source of considerable debate. There is a
growing acceptance in the high-Tc community that the mediating bosons leading
to Cooper pairing have largely electronic character. At the same time there is
an increasing acknowledgement that at some level the lattice-charge
interactions might be important in cuprates. The experimentally observed
substantially large IE over certain doping range always casts a shadow over any
proposal where non-phononic mechanism is invoked. Besides, the various existing
theoretical schemes, based on electron-phonon interactions, cannot describe the
anomalous features shown by the IE as a function of hole
concentration/disorder, either quantitatively or qualitatively. Based on a
recent experiment relating the possibility of Fermi-surface reconstruction to
the thermoelectric transport measurements (Nature Commun. 2:432 doi:
10.1038/ncomms1440 (2011)), we propose here a simple scenario where isotope
substitutions affect the charge/spin stripe state via the coupling to the
underlying lattice and thereby change the superconducting Tc. In this picture,
significant part of the IE, over an extended p-range, actually originates from
the isotope induced stripe modulation and is not directly related to the
characteristic energy scale of the pairing phonons as is the case in
conventional BCS theory. Our proposal qualitatively explains all the disorder-
and p-dependent features of the IE seen in hole doped high-Tc cuprates. We also
provide with an outline of some experiments that can verify the degree of
validity of the proposed scenario.

introduces privacy concerns in a system theoretic context, and addresses the
problem of releasing filtered signals that respect the privacy of the user data

literature, called differential privacy, which provides strong privacy
guarantees against adversaries with arbitrary side information. Methods are
developed to approximate a given filter by a differentially private version, so
that the distortion introduced by the privacy mechanism is minimized. Two
specific scenarios are considered. First, the notion of differential privacy is
extended to dynamic systems with many participants contributing independent
input signals. Kalman filtering is also discussed in this context, when a
released output signal must preserve differential privacy for the measured
signals or state trajectories of the individual participants. Second,
differentially private mechanisms are described to approximate stable filters
when participants contribute to a single event stream, extending previous work
on differential privacy under continual observation.

In this paper, we develop the pair construction for Levy copulas (PLCC).
Similar to pair constructions of distributional copulas, the pair construction

where countable is replaced by uncountable. We explore properties of
generalized Baire and Cantor spaces, equivalence relations and their Borel
reducibility. The study shows that the descriptive set theory looks very
different in this generalized setting compared to the classical, countable
case. We also draw the connection between the stability theoretic complexity of
first-order theories and the descriptive set theoretic complexity of their
isomorphism relations. Our results suggest that Borel reducibility on
uncountable structures is a model theoretically natural way to compare the

quite well by a dimensionless activation energy having the functional form of
U(T, H) = (1-t)^m(H0/H)^-{\beta}, where t = T/Tp, is the reduced temperature
and H0, is a characteristic field scale that primarily determines the magnitude
of the activation energy for a given sample composition. The temperature
exponent, m, shows a systematic variation with the hole content, whereas the
field exponent, {\beta}, is insensitive to the p-values and is close to unity
irrespective of the film composition. H0, on the other hand, changes rapidly as
hole concentration is varied. Possible implications of these results are
discussed in this paper.

channels of strongly interacting particles are investigated. The particles are
free to move in the $x$-direction but are confined by a parabolic potential in
the $y$-direction. They interact with each other through a screened power-law
potential ($r^{-n}e^{-r/\lambda}$). In vertically coupled systems the channels
are stacked above each other in the direction perpendicular to the
$(x,y)$-plane, while in horizontally coupled systems both channels are aligned
in the confinement direction. Using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations we obtain the
ground state configurations and the structural transitions as a function of the
linear particle density and the separation between the channels. At zero
temperature the vertically coupled system exhibits a rich phase diagram with
continuous and discontinuous transitions. On the other hand the vertically
coupled system exhibits only a very limited number of phase transitions due to
its symmetry. Further we calculated the normal modes for the Wigner crystals in
both cases. From MC simulations we found that in the case of vertically coupled
systems the zigzag transition is only possible for low densities. A
Ginzburg-Landau theory for the zigzag transition is presented, which predicts
correctly the behavior of this transition from which we interpret the
structural phase transition of the Wigner crystal through the reduction of the

direct inversion of matrices for obtaining the self-energy terms of electrodes
is computationally demanding in the real-space method because the matrix
dimension corresponds to the number of grid points in the unit cell of
electrodes, which is much larger than that of sites in the tight-binding
approach. The procedure using the ratio matrices of the overbridging
boundary-matching technique [Phys. Rev. B {\bf 67}, 195315 (2003)], which is
related to the wave functions of a couple of grid planes in the matching
regions, greatly reduces the computational effort to calculate self-energy
terms without losing mathematical strictness. In addition, the present
procedure saves computational time to obtain Green's function of the
semi-infinite system required in the Landauer-B\""uttiker formula. Moreover, the
compact expression to relate Green's functions and scattering wave functions,
which provide a real-space picture of the scattering process, is introduced. An
example of the calculated results is given for the transport property of the BN
ring connected to (9,0) carbon nanotubes. The wave function matching at the
interface reveals that the rotational symmetry of wave functions with respect
to the tube axis plays an important role in electron transport. Since the
states coming from and going to electrodes show threefold rotational symmetry,
the states in the vicinity of the Fermi level, whose wave function exhibits
fivefold symmetry, do not contribute to the electron transport through the BN
ring.

determinants whose entries are ultraspherical, Laguerre and Hermite
polynomials. For $T=\Delta$, the first order difference operator, we get some
very elegant symmetries for Casorati determinants of classical discrete
orthogonal polynomials. We also show that for certain operators $T$, the second
determinant above can be rewritten in terms of Selberg type integrals, and that
for certain operators $T$ and certain families of orthogonal polynomials
$(p_n)_n$, one (or both) of these determinants can also be rewritten as the
constant term of certain multivariate Laurent expansions.

use observations obtained at the German Vacuum Tower Telescope (Observatorio

Spectrometer (TESOS), in the BaII 4554 A line to measure velocity and intensity
variations along the photosphere; and, simultaneously, Tenerife Infrared
Polarimeter (TIP-II), in the FeI 1.56 $\mu$m lines to the measure Stokes
parameters and the magnetic field strength at the lower photosphere. We obtain
that the convective velocities of granules in the facular area decrease with
magnetic field while the convective velocities of intergranular lanes increase
with the field strength. Similar to the quiet areas, there is a contrast and
velocity sign reversal taking place in the middle photosphere. The reversal
heights depend on the magnetic field strength and are, on average, about 100 km
higher than in the quiet regions. The correlation between convective velocity
and intensity decreases with magnetic field at the bottom photosphere, but
increases in the upper photosphere. The contrast of intergranular lanes
observed close to the disc center is almost independent of the magnetic field
strength. The strong magnetic field of facular area seems to stabilize the
convection and to promote more effective energy transfer in the upper layers of
the solar atmosphere, since the convective elements reach larger heights.

a neutron star being the compact object in the system. Here, we discuss the
transitions among the states accessible to a neutron star in a system like LS I
+61{\deg}303, such as the ejector, propeller and accretor phases, depending on
the NS spin period, magnetic field and rate of mass captured. We show how the
observed bolometric luminosity (>= few x 1E35 erg/s), and its broad-band
spectral distribution, indicate that the compact object is most probably close
to the transition between working as an ejector all along its orbit, and being
powered by the propeller effect when it is close to the orbit periastron, in a
so-called flip-flop state. By assessing the torques acting onto the compact
object in the various states, we follow the spin evolution of the system,
evaluating the time spent by the system in each of them. Even taking into
account the constraint set by the observed gamma-ray luminosity, we found that
the total age of the system is compatible with being ~5-10 kyr, comparable to
the typical spin-down ages of high-field neutron stars. The results obtained
are discussed in the context of the various evolutionary stages expected for a
neutron star with a high mass companion.

nature. According to the peculiarities of deterministic dynamics, we derive the
Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations in the energy representation of two normal
modes. We find the stationary distribution function in the subcritical and
overcritical regimes and calculate the current dependence of the average
energy, energy fluctuation and their ratio (quality factor). The noncritical
mode shows the Boltzmann statistics with the current-dependent effective
temperature in the whole range of the current values. The effective temperature
of the other, i.e., soft, mode critically depends on the current in the
subcritical region. Distribution function of the soft mode follows the Gaussian
law above the generation threshold. In the overcritical regime, the total
average energy and the quality factor grow with the current value. This raises
the AFM nanooscillators to the promising candidates for active spintronic
components.

(0.5 \mJybeam, 1.4 \mJyarcminsq on average) structure around the radio source
B2 0258+35 hosted by an HI-rich early-type galaxy (NGC 1167). Since B2 0258+35
is a young Compact Steep Spectrum (CSS) source, the newly discovered structure
could represent a remnant from an earlier stage of AGN activity.
  We go on by explaining in detail all the possibilities for triggering the
radio activity in B2 0258+35 regarding gas accretion in a recurrent AGN
activity framework.
  NGC 1167 hosts a very regular, extended and massive \HI\ disc that has been
studied in great detail. Previous studies of the \HI\ closer to the core seem
to go against the assumption of a circum-nuclear disc of \HI\ as the source of
the accreting gas.
  We consider the cooling of gas from the hot, X-ray halo as a possible
alternative option for the fueling of the AGN, as suggested in the case of
other sources of similar radio power as B2 0258+35.
  Estimates are given for the age of the faint diffuse emission as well as for
the current accretion rate, which are in good agreement with literature values.
  If our assumptions about the accretion mechanism are correct, similar
large-scale, relic-like structures should be more commonly found around
early-type galaxies and this will be hopefully confirmed by the next generation
of sensitive, low-frequency radio surveys.

The two parameters $a$ and $\sigma$ of the process combined with time $t$ are
mapped to the parameters $q$ and $\theta$ of the biorthogonal polynomials. By
the transformation of normalization factor of our probability density, the
partition function of the Chern-Simons matrix model is readily obtained. We
study the determinantal structure of the matrix model and prove that, at each

their subsurface structure is an outstanding problem of wide physical

strongly anisotropic magnetic waveguides, these measurements have always been
interpreted in terms of changes to isotropic wavespeeds and flow-advection
related Doppler shifts. Here, we employ PDE-constrained optimization to
determine the appropriate parameterization of the structural properties of the
magnetic interior. Seven different wavespeeds fully characterize helioseismic
wave propagation: the isotropic sound speed, a Doppler-shifting flow-advection
velocity and an anisotropic magnetic velocity. The structure of magnetic media
is sensed by magnetoacoustic slow and fast modes and Alfv\'{e}n waves, each of
which propagates at a different wavespeed. We show that even in the case of
weak magnetic fields, significant errors may be incurred if these anisotropies

the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in the 720 deg^2 of the South Pole Telescope
(SPT) survey completed in the 2008 and 2009 observing seasons. We use the
optical/NIR data to establish whether each candidate is associated with an
overdensity of galaxies and to estimate the cluster redshift. Most photometric
redshifts are derived through a combination of three different cluster redshift
estimators using red-sequence galaxies, resulting in an accuracy of \Delta
z/(1+z)=0.017, determined through comparison with a subsample of 57 clusters
for which we have spectroscopic redshifts. We successfully measure redshifts
for 158 systems and present redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates.
The redshift distribution of the confirmed clusters extends to z=1.35 with a
median of z_{med}=0.57. Approximately 18% of the sample with measured redshifts
lies at z>0.8. We estimate a lower limit to the purity of this SPT SZ-selected
sample by assuming that all unconfirmed clusters are noise fluctuations in the
SPT data. We show that the cumulative purity at detection significance \xi>5
(\xi>4.5) is >= 95 (>= 70%). We present the red brightest cluster galaxy (rBCG)
positions for the sample and examine the offsets between the SPT candidate
position and the rBCG. The radial distribution of offsets is similar to that
seen in X-ray-selected cluster samples, providing no evidence that SZ-selected
cluster samples include a different fraction of recent mergers than
X-ray-selected cluster samples.

programs have been used recently to devise approximation algorithms for various
optimization problems. The approximation guarantee of these algorithms improves
with the number of {\em rounds} $r$ in the hierarchy, though the complexity of
solving (or even writing down the solution for) the $r$'th level program grows
as $n^{\Omega(r)}$ where $n$ is the input size.
  In this work, we observe that many of these algorithms are based on {\em
local} rounding procedures that only use a small part of the SDP solution (of
size $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(r)}$ instead of $n^{\Omega(r)}$). We give an algorithm to
find the requisite portion in time polynomial in its size. The challenge in
achieving this is that the required portion of the solution is not fixed a
priori but depends on other parts of the solution, sometimes in a complicated
iterative manner.
  Our solver leads to $n^{O(1)} 2^{O(r)}$ time algorithms to obtain the same
guarantees in many cases as the earlier $n^{O(r)}$ time algorithms based on $r$
rounds of the Lasserre hierarchy. In particular, guarantees based on $O(\log
n)$ rounds can be realized in polynomial time.
  We develop and describe our algorithm in a fairly general abstract framework.
The main technical tool in our work, which might be of independent interest in
convex optimization, is an efficient ellipsoid algorithm based separation
oracle for convex programs that can output a {\em certificate of infeasibility
with restricted support}. This is used in a recursive manner to find a sequence
of consistent points in nested convex bodies that ""fools"" local rounding
algorithms.

lattice QCD, we investigate the propagator and the effective mass of the gluon
fields in the MA gauge with U(1)$_3 \timesU(1)_8$ Landau gauge fixing. The
Monte Carlo simulation is performed on $16^4$ at $\beta$=5.7, 5.8 and 6.0 at
the quenched level. The off-diagonal gluons behave as massive vector bosons
with the approximate effective mass $M_{\mathrm{off}} \simeq
1.1-1.2\mathrm{GeV}$ in the region of $r =0.3-0.8$fm, and the propagation is
limited within a short range, while the propagation of diagonal gluons remains
even in a large range. In this way, infrared Abelian dominance is shown in
terms of short-range propagation of off-diagonal gluons. Furthermore, we
investigate the functional form of the off-diagonal gluon propagator. The
functional form is well described by the four-dimensional Euclidean Yukawa-type
function $e^{-m_{\rm off}r}/r$ with $m_{\rm off} \simeq 1.3-1.4\mathrm{GeV}$

It is usually distinguished between unit and item nonresponse: in the former,
we completely fail to have information from a unit selected in the sample,
while in the latter, we observe only part of the information on the selected
unit. Unit nonresponse is usually dealt with by reweighting: each unit selected

probability; the initial sampling weight is multiplied by the inverse of
estimated response probability. Item nonresponse is usually dealt with by
imputation. By noting that for a particular survey variable, we just have
observed and unobserved values, in this work we exploit the connection between
unit and item nonresponse. In particular, we assume that the factors that drive
unit response are the same as those that drive item response on selected

and that can explain part of the unknown behavior of a unit to participate in
the survey. The latent covariate is estimated using latent trait models. Such
approach is particularly relevant for sensitive items and, therefore, can
handle non-ignorable nonresponse. Auxiliary information known for both
respondents and nonrespondents can be included either in the latent variable
model or in the logistic model. The approach can be also used when auxiliary
information is not available, and we focus here on this case. The theoretical

can be utilized as chemical and gas sensors. TiO2 is a semiconductor material,
which can have a wide range of applications in nanopore-based sensors. In this
study, TiO2 nanopores were prepared by electrochemical anodization. Titanium
was used as the anode, while platinum was used as the cathode in an
electrochemical cell filled with a hydrofluoric acid electrolyte solution.
During the preparation process, titanium was converted to its oxide form.
Nanostructures were synthesized under varying physical conditions, including HF
concentrations of 0.5-10% and anodization times of 5-30 minutes. The resulting
nanopore structures were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
With a progressive increase in HF concentration (from 0.5% to 10%), the
diameter of the nanopores decreased, from approximately 100 nm in diameter to
50 nm. The nanopores showed a transformation from tube-like structures to pore
networks with increased HF concentration or anodization time. The results show
that the dimensions and morphology of the nanopores can be controlled by
alteration of the anodization conditions.

conductivity in a two dimensional S=1/2 Heisenberg quantum magnet on a square
lattice. We explore the model in both the Neel antiferromagnetic (AF) phase and
the collinear antiferromagnetic (CAF) phase. We find that in contrast to the
effects of spin anisotropy in the Heisenberg model, spatial anisotropy in the
AF phase does not suppress the zero temperature regular part of the spin
conductivity in the zero frequency limit - rather it enhances it. We also
explore the finite temperature effects on the Drude weight in the AF phase for
various spatial and spin anisotropy parameters. We find that the Drude weight
goes to zero as the temperature approaches zero. At finite temperatures (within
the collision less approximation) enhancing spatial anisotropy increases the
Drude weight value and increasing spin anisotropy decreases the Drude weight
value. In the CAF phase (within the non-interacting approximation) the zero
frequency spin conductivity has a finite value for non-zero values of the
spatial anisotropy parameter. In the CAF phase increasing the spatial
anisotropy parameter suppresses the regular part of the spin conductivity
response at zero frequency. Furthermore, we find that the CAF phase displays a
spike in the spin conductivity not seen in the AF phase. Inclusion of the
smallest amount of spin anisotropy causes a gap to develop in the spin
conductivity response of both the AF and CAF phase. Based on these studies we
conclude that materials with spatial anisotropy are better spin conductors than
those with spin anisotropy both at zero and finite temperatures. We utilize
exchange parameter ratios for real material systems as inputs to the
computation of spin conductivity.

prominent class of possible sources of very high energy cosmic ray particles

energy from some shock, implies an enormous hidden energy for a spectrum of
index ~-2. Some analyzes suggest the particles' injection spectrum at source to
be as steep as -2.4 to -2.7, making the problem much worse, by a factor of
order 10^6. Nevertheless, it seems implausible that more than at the very best
1/3 of the jet energy, goes into the required flux of energetic particles thus,
one would need to allow for the possibility that there is an energy problem,
which we would like to address in this work. Sequences of consecutive oblique
shock features, or conical shocks, have been theorized and eventually observed
in many AGN jets. Based on that, we use by analogy the 'Comptonisation' effect
and we propose a scenario of a single injection of particles which are
accelerated consecutively by several oblique shocks along the axis of an AGN
jet. We use detailed test-particle approximation Monte Carlo simulations in
order to calculate particle spectra by acceleration at such a shock pattern
while monitoring the efficiency of acceleration, calculating differential
spectra. We find that the first shock of a sequence of oblique shocks,
establishes a low energy power-law spectrum with ~E^-2.7. The consecutive
shocks push the spectrum up in energy, rendering flatter distributions with
steep cut-offs and characteristic depletion at low energies, an effect which
could explain the puzzling apparent extra source power as well as the flat or
inverted spectra from distant flaring sources.
