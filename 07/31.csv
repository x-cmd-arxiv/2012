is found to exhibit a universal wave pattern (""gradient marker"") in a vicinity
of the maxima/minima of the gradient. The pattern is common for optics, quantum
mechanics and any other propagation governed by the same wave equation. Derived
analytically in adiabatic limit, it has an elegantly simple yet nontrivial
single-cycle profile, which is found in perfect agreement with numerical
simulations for specific examples. We also found resonant states in continuum
in the case of quantum wells, and formulated criterium for their existence.

pinning available in MgB2, rather than by lack of connectivity. This suggests
strongly that both increasing sample size and enhancing pinning through doping
will allow further increases in trapped field performance of bulk MgB2.

as the flux decreases, then soften. This change in behaviour has been variously
attributed to either the X-rays switching from being produced in the flow to
being dominated by the jet, or to the flow switching seed photons from the disc
to self generated seed photons from cyclo-synchrotron. Here we build a simple
truncated disc, hot inner flow, plus standard conical synchrotron jet model to
explore what this predicts for the X-ray emission mechanism as a function of
mass accretion rate.
  We find that the change in X-ray spectral index can be quantitatively (not
just qualitatively) explained by the seed photon switch in the hot flow i.e.
this supports models where the X-rays are always produced by the hot flow. By
contrast, standard conical jet models are as radiatively inefficient as the hot
flow so there is no transition in X-ray production mechanism with $\dot{m}$.
Including the effects of electron cooling allows the jet X-rays to drop more
slowly with accretion rate and hence overtake the X-rays from the hot flow,
however this produces a corresponding change in the radio-X-ray correlation,
which is not observed. We argue that the unbroken radio-X-ray correlation down
to quiescence rules out the jet transition model as an explanation for the
trend in X-ray spectral index.
  Our favoured model is then a truncated disc with an inner, hot, radiatively
inefficient flow which always dominates the hard X-rays, coupled to a conical
synchrotron jet which produces the radio emission. However, even this has
issues at low $\dot{m}$ as the low optical depth and high temperature of the
flow means that the Compton spectrum is not well approximated by a power law.
This shows the need for a more sophisticated model for the electron
distribution in the hot flow.

settings, where lack of obvious orderings on their data space, require notions
of data equivalences to be considered. For example, Varshney & Goyal (DCC,
2006) considered multiset equivalences, while Choi & Szpankowski (IEEE Trans.
IT, 2012) considered isomorphic equivalences in graphs. Here equivalences are
considered under a relatively broad framework - finite-dimensional,
non-sequential data spaces with equivalences under group action, for which
analogues of two well-studied embedding theorems are derived: the Whitney
embedding theorem and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma. Only the canonical data
points need to be carefully embedded, each such point representing a set of
data points equivalent under group action. Two-step embeddings are considered.
First, a group invariant is applied to account for equivalences, and then
secondly, a linear embedding takes it down to low-dimensions. Our results
require hypotheses on discriminability of the applied invariant, such notions
related to seperating invariants (Dufresne, 2008), and completeness in pattern
recognition (Kakarala, 1992). In the latter theorem, the embedding complexity
depends on the size of the canonical part, which may be significantly smaller
than the whole data set, up to a factor equal to the size the group.

O-type stars. Among this select group, it stands out due to its sharp-lined
photospheric spectrum. Since its discovery, the MiMeS Collaboration has
continued to obtain spectroscopic and magnetic observations in order to refine
our knowledge of its magnetic field strength and geometry, rotational period,
and spectral properties and variability. In this paper we report new ESPaDOnS
spectropolarimetric observations of HD 57682, which are combined with
previously published ESPaDOnS data and archival H{\alpha} spectroscopy. This
dataset is used to determine the rotational period (63.5708 \pm 0.0057 d),
refine the longitudinal magnetic field variation and magnetic geometry (dipole
surface field strength of 880\pm50 G and magnetic obliquity of 79\pm4\circ as
measured from the magnetic longitudinal field variations, assuming an
inclination of 60\circ), and examine the phase variation of various lines. In
particular, we demonstrate that the H{\alpha} equivalent width undergoes a
double-wave variation during a single rotation of the star, consistent with the
derived magnetic geometry. We group the variable lines into two classes: those
that, like H{\alpha}, exhibit non-sinusoidal variability, often with multiple
maxima during the rotation cycle, and those that vary essentially sinusoidally.
Based on our modelling of the H{\alpha} emission, we show that the variability
is consistent with emission being generated from an optically thick, flattened
distribution of magnetically-confined plasma that is roughly distributed about
the magnetic equator. Finally, we discuss our findings in the magnetospheric
framework proposed in our earlier study.

formation process. We build on our previous work by calculating separately the
dust and gas temperatures. The dust temperature is set by radiative equilibrium
between heating by embedded stars and radiation from dust. The gas temperature
is determined using an energy-rate balance algorithm which includes molecular
cooling, dust-gas collisional energy transfer, and cosmic-ray ionization. The
fragmentation proceeds roughly similarly to simulations in which the gas
temperature is set to the dust temperature, but there are differences. The
structure of regions around sink particles have properties similar to those of
Class 0 objects, but the infall speeds and mass accretion rates were, on
average, higher than those seen for regions forming only low-mass stars. The
gas and dust temperature have complex distributions not well modeled by
approximations that ignore the detailed thermal physics. There is no simple
relationship between density and kinetic temperature. In particular, high
density regions have a large range of temperatures, determined by their
location relative to heating sources. The total luminosity underestimates the
star formation rate at these early stages, before ionizing sources are
included, by an order of magnitude. As predicted in our previous work, a larger
number of intermediate mass objects form when improved thermal physics is
included, but the resulting IMF still has too few low mass stars. However, if
we consider recent evidence on core-to-star efficiencies, the match to the IMF
is improved.

an intuitive picture in which the solvent concentration gradient, at osmotic
equilibrium, arises from the balance between an outward force, caused by the
increased total density in the solution, and an inward diffusive flux caused by
the decreased solvent density in the solution. While more complex effects may
occur in other osmotic systems, they are not required for a description of the

coalgebra and for Hopf algebras the self-dual notion of a strongly bicovariant
differential graded algebra $(\Omega,d)$ augmented by a codifferential $i$ of
degree -1. Here $\Omega$ is a graded super-Hopf algebra extending the Hopf
algebra $\Omega^0=A$ and, where applicable, the dual super-Hopf algebra gives
the same structure on the dual Hopf algebra. We show how to construct such
objects from first order data, with both a minimal construction using
braided-antisymmetrizes and a maximal one using braided tensor algebras and
with dual given via braided-shuffle algebras. The theory is applied to quantum
groups with $\Omega^1(C_q(G))$ dually paired to $\Omega^1(U_q(g))$, and to
finite groups in relation to (super) Hopf quivers.

possibility of entanglement between cells. Here, we present computational
results that treat small groups of QCA cells with a Hamiltonian analogous to a
quantum mechanical Ising-like spin chain in a transverse field, including the
effects of intercellular entanglement. When energy relaxation is included in
the model, we find that intercellular entanglement changes the qualitative
behaviour of the system, and new features appear. In clocked QCA, isolated
groups of active cells experience oscillations in their polarization states as
information propagates. Additionally, energy relaxation tends to bring groups
of cells to an unpolarized ground state. This contrasts with the results of
previous simulations which employed the ICHA. The ICHA is a valid approximation
in the limit of very low tunneling rates, which can be realized in
lithographically defined quantum-dots. However, in molecular and atomic
implementations of QCA, entanglement will play a greater role. The degree to
which entanglement poses a problem for memory and clocking depends upon the

(DESpec, SUMIRE, BigBOSS, 4MOST, HECTOR) demand fast, efficient and affordable
spectrographs, with higher resolutions (R = 3000-5000) than current designs.
Beam-size is a (relatively) free parameter in the design, but the properties of
VPH gratings are such that, for fixed resolution and wavelength coverage, the
effect on beam-size on overall VPH efficiency is very small. For
alltransmissive cameras, this suggests modest beam-sizes (say 80-150mm) to
minimize costs; while for catadioptric (Schmidt-type) cameras, much larger
beam-sizes (say 250mm+) are preferred to improve image quality and to minimize
obstruction losses. Schmidt designs have benefits in terms of image quality,
camera speed and scattered light performance, and recent advances such as MRF
technology mean that the required aspherics are no longer a prohibitive cost or
risk. A new Schmidt/Maksutov-derived design is presented, which differs from
previous designs in having the detector package outside the camera, and
adjacent to the spectrograph pupil. The telescope pupil already contains a hole
at its center, because of the obstruction from the telescope top-end. With a
250mm beam, it is possible to largely hide a 6cm \times 6cm detector package
and its dewar within this hole. This means that the design achieves a very high
efficiency, competitive with transmissive designs. The optics are excellent, as
least as good as classic Schmidt designs, allowing F/1.25 or even faster
cameras. The principal hardware has been costed at $300K per arm, making the
design affordable.

boundary divergences, which presumably correspond to real (but finite) physical
effects occurring near the boundary. Our working hypothesis is that the stress
tensor for idealized boundary conditions with some finite cutoff should be a
reasonable ad hoc model for the true situation. The theory will have a sensible
renormalized limit when the cutoff is taken away; this requires making sense of
the Einstein equation with a distributional source. Calculations with the
standard ultraviolet cutoff reveal an inconsistency between energy and pressure
similar to the one that arises in noncovariant regularizations of cosmological
vacuum energy. The problem disappears, however, if the cutoff is a spatial
point separation in a ""neutral"" direction parallel to the boundary. Here we
demonstrate these claims in detail, first for a single flat reflecting wall
intersected by a test boundary, then more rigorously for a region of finite
cross section surrounded by four reflecting walls. We also show how the
moment-expansion theorem can be applied to the distributional limits of the
source and the solution of the Einstein equation, resulting in a mathematically
consistent differential equation where cutoff-dependent coefficients have been
identified as renormalizations of properties of the boundary. A number of
issues surrounding the interpretation of these results are aired.

set of human microbial communities where the sequencing results cluster by

Factors such as bin size, using presence or absence calls and technical
replicate manipulation had a negligible effect on clustering. In fact, no
established bin sizing method reported in the literature performed
significantly different results than simply picking bin intervals at random. We
conclude that in an analysis of ARISA data from an ecosystem of sufficient
complexity to saturate bins, a careful choice of clustering algorithm is
essential whereas differing strategies for choosing bins are likely to have a
much less pronounced effect on the outcome of the analysis. As a tool for
distinguishing complex microbial communities, ARISA closely approximates the

response function at zero wavevector that can be used to define the full
complex frequency-dependent viscosity tensor, both with and without a uniform
magnetic field. The formulas in the existing literature are frequently
incomplete, incorrect, or lack a derivation; in particular, Hall viscosity is
overlooked. Our approach begins from the response to a uniform external strain
field, which is an active time-dependent coordinate transformation in d space
dimensions. These transformations form the group GL(d,R) of invertible
matrices, and the infinitesimal generators are called strain generators. These
enable us to express the Kubo formula in different ways, related by Ward
identities; some of these make contact with the adiabatic transport approach.
For Galilean-invariant systems, we derive a relation between the stress
response tensor and the conductivity tensor that is valid at all frequencies
and in both the presence and absence of a magnetic field. In the presence of a
magnetic field and at low frequency, this yields a relation between the Hall
viscosity, the q^2 part of the Hall conductivity, the inverse compressibility
(suitably defined), and the diverging part of the shear viscosity (if any);
this relation generalizes a result found recently. We show that the correct
value of the Hall viscosity at zero frequency can be obtained (at least in the
absence of low-frequency bulk and shear viscosity) by assuming that there is an
orbital spin per particle that couples to a perturbing electromagnetic field as
a magnetization per particle. We study several examples as checks on our
formulation.

faster than 20 fs. Alternatively, ultrafast electron diffraction may be used to
investigate the near-field dynamics of the plasmonic antenna.

$n$-point Euclidean space, a $(1+\eps)$-spanner with constant degree,
hop-diameter $O(\log n)$ and weight $O(\log n) \cdot \omega(MST)$ can be built
in $O(n \log n)$ time. Recently Elkin and Solomon (technical report, April
2012) proved this conjecture of Arya et al. in the affirmative. In fact, the
proof of Elkin and Solomon is more general in two ways. First, it applies to
arbitrary doubling metrics. Second, it provides a complete tradeoff between the
three involved parameters that is tight (up to constant factors) in the entire
range.
  Subsequently, Chan et al. (technical report, July 2012) provided another
proof for Arya et al.'s conjecture, which is simpler than the proof of Elkin
and Solomon. Moreover, Chan et al. (2012) also showed that one can build a
fault-tolerant (FT) spanner with similar properties. Specifically, they showed
that there exists a $k$-FT $(1+\eps)$-spanner with degree $O(k^2)$,
hop-diameter $O(\log n)$ and weight $O(k^3 \cdot \log n) \cdot \omega(MST)$.
The running time of the construction of Chan et al. was not analyzed.
  In this work we improve the results of Chan et al., using a simpler proof.
Specifically, we present a simple proof which shows that a $k$-FT
$(1+\eps)$-spanner with degree $O(k^2)$, hop-diameter $O(\log n)$ and weight
$O(k^2 \cdot \log n) \cdot \omega(MST)$ can be built in $O(n \cdot (\log n +
k^2))$ time. Similarly to the constructions of Elkin and Solomon and Chan et
al., our construction applies to arbitrary doubling metrics. However, in
contrast to the construction of Elkin and Solomon, our construction fails to
provide a complete (and tight) tradeoff between the three involved parameters.
The construction of Chan et al. has this drawback too.
  For random point sets in $\mathbb R^d$, we ""shave"" a factor of $\log n$ from
the weight bound.

comes from type II spicule material that is heated as it is ejected from the
chromosphere. This contrasts with the traditional view that the corona is
filled via chromospheric evaporation that results from coronal heating. We
explore the observational consequences of a hypothetical spicule dominated
corona and conclude from the large discrepancy between predicted and actual
observations that only a small fraction of the hot plasma can be supplied by
spicules (<2% in active regions, <5% in the quiet Sun, and <8% in coronal
holes). The red-blue asymmetries of EUV spectral lines and the ratio of lower
transition region (LTR; T<0.1 MK) to coronal emission measures are both
predicted to be 2 orders of magnitude larger than observed. Furthermore, hot
spicule material would cool dramatically by adiabatic expansion as it rises
into the corona, so substantial coronal heating would be needed to maintain the
high temperatures that are seen at all altitudes. We suggest that the corona
contains a mixture of thin strands, some of which are populated by spicule
injections, but most of which are not. A majority of the observed hot emission
originates in non-spicule strands and is explained by traditional coronal
heating models. However, since these models predict far too little emission
from the LTR, most of this emission comes from the bulk of the spicule material
that is only weakly heated and visible in He II (304 A) as it falls back to the

of solid helium confined in porous Vycor glass and found an abrupt drop in the
resonant period below 200 mK. The period drop was interpreted as probable
experimental evidence of nonclassical rotational inertia (NCRI). This
experiment sparked considerable activities in the studies of superfluidity in
solid helium. More recent ultrasound and TO studies, however, found evidence
that shear modulus stiffening is responsible for at least a fraction of the
period drop found in bulk solid helium samples. The experimental configuration
of KC makes it unavoidable to have a small amount of bulk solid inside the
torsion cell containing the Vycor disc. We report here the results of a new
helium in Vycor experiment with a design that is completely free from any bulk
solid shear modulus stiffening effect. We found no measureable period drop that
can be attributed to NCRI.

due to the motion of vortices generated by the magnetization dynamics of the

in an increase in resistance on the superconducting side of the transition, but
an increase in conductance on the insulating side.

has traditionally been deployed over tightly-coupled clusters where the data is
already locally available. The assumption that the data and compute resources
are available in a single central location, however, no longer holds for many
emerging applications in commercial, scientific and social networking domains,
where the data is generated in a geographically distributed manner. Further,
the computational resources needed for carrying out the data analysis may be
distributed across multiple data centers or community resources such as Grids.
In this paper, we develop a modeling framework to capture MapReduce execution
in a highly distributed environment comprising distributed data sources and
distributed computational resources. This framework is flexible enough to
capture several design choices and performance optimizations for MapReduce
execution. We propose a model-driven optimization that has two key features:
(i) it is end-to-end as opposed to myopic optimizations that may only make
locally optimal but globally suboptimal decisions, and (ii) it can control
multiple MapReduce phases to achieve low runtime, as opposed to single-phase
optimizations that may control only individual phases. Our model results show
that our optimization can provide nearly 82% and 64% reduction in execution
time over myopic and single-phase optimizations, respectively. We have modified
Hadoop to implement our model outputs, and using three different MapReduce
applications over an 8-node emulated PlanetLab testbed, we show that our
optimized Hadoop execution plan achieves 31-41% reduction in runtime over a
vanilla Hadoop execution. Our model-driven optimization also provides several
insights into the choice of techniques and execution parameters based on
application and platform characteristics.

of line emission at 111 GeV and 129 GeV in the Galactic center, we examine the
co-added gamma-ray spectrum of unassociated point sources in the Second
Fermi-LAT catalog (2FGL) using 3.9 years of LAT data. Using the SOURCE event
class, we find evidence for lines at 111 GeV and 129 GeV with a local
significance of 3.3 sigma based on a conservative estimate of the background at
E>135 GeV. Other 2FGL sources analyzed in the same way do not show line
emission at 111 GeV and 129 GeV. The line-emitting sources are mostly within 30
degrees of the Galactic plane, although this anisotropy may be a selection
effect. If the double-line emission from these objects is confirmed with future
data, it will provide compelling support for the hypothesis that the Galactic
center line signal is indeed from dark matter annihilation.

model, the stability of dark matter is realized by the global U(1)$_{DM}$
symmetry which arises by the B$-$L charge assignment. Right-handed neutrinos
obtain TeV scale Majorana masses at the tree level. Dirac masses of neutrinos
are generated via one-loop diagrams. Consequently, tiny neutrino masses are
generated at the two-loop level by the seesaw mechanism. This model gives
characteristic predictions, such as light decayable right-handed neutrinos,
Dirac fermion dark matter and an extra heavy vector boson. These new particles
would be accessible at collider experiments because their masses are at the TeV
scale. The U(1)$_{B-L}$ vector boson may be found at the LHC, while the other
new particles could only be tested at future linear colliders. We find that the
dark matter can be observed at a linear collider with $\sqrt{s}$=500 GeV and
that light right-handed neutrinos can also be probed with $\sqrt{s}$=1 TeV.

These groups are distributed in various large-scale environments from voids to

they reside. Our aim is to study the effects that the local group scale and the
supercluster scale environment have on galaxies. We use a luminosity-density
field to determine density of the large-scale environment of galaxies in groups
of various richness. We calculate fractions of different types of galaxies in
groups with richnesses up to 50 member galaxies and in different large-scale
environments from voids to superclusters. The fraction of passive elliptical
galaxies rises and the fraction of star-forming spiral galaxies declines when
the richness of a group of galaxies rises from two to approximately ten
galaxies. On the large scale, the passive elliptical galaxies become more
numerous than star-forming spirals when the environmental density grows to the
density level typical for superclusters. The large-scale environment affects
the level of these fractions in groups: galaxies in equally rich groups are
more likely to be elliptical in supercluster environments than in lower
densities. The crossing point, where the number of passive and star-forming
galaxies is equal, happens in groups with lower richness in superclusters than
in voids. Galaxies in low-density areas require richer groups to evolve from
star-forming to passive. Groups in superclusters are on average more luminous
than groups in large-scale environments with lower density. Our results suggest
that the evolution of galaxies is affected by both, by the group in which the
galaxy resides, and by its large-scale environment. Galaxies in lower-density
regions develop later than galaxies in similar mass groups in high-density
environments.

spectra and Hubble imaging from which we measure emission-line kinematics and
galaxy inclinations, respectively. Our large sample allows us to overcome
scatter intrinsic to galaxy properties in order to examine trends in
kinematics. We find that at a fixed stellar mass galaxies systematically
decrease in disordered motions and increase in rotation velocity and potential
well depth with time. Massive galaxies are the most well-ordered at all times
examined, with higher rotation velocities and less disordered motions than less
massive galaxies. We quantify disordered motions with an integrated gas
velocity dispersion corrected for beam smearing (sigma_g). It is unlike the
typical pressure-supported velocity dispersion measured for early type galaxies
and galaxy bulges. Because both seeing and the width of our spectral slits
comprise a significant fraction of the galaxy sizes, sigma_g integrates over
velocity gradients on large scales which can correspond to non-ordered gas
kinematics. We compile measurements of galaxy kinematics from the literature
over 1.2<z<3.8 and do not find any trends with redshift, likely for the most
part because these datasets are biased toward the most highly star-forming
systems. In summary, over the last ~8 billion years since z=1.2, blue galaxies
evolve from disordered to ordered systems as they settle to become the
rotation-dominated disk galaxies observed in the Universe today, with the most
massive galaxies being the most evolved at any time.

reproduce the old stellar populations observed for massive galaxies, they fail
in reproducing their observed chemical abundances. This problem is alleviate
but still present if AGN feedback is completely switched off. Moreover, in this
case, model predictions fail in accounting for the old stellar ages of massive

nuclei (AGN) are not entirely consistent with AGN observations. As well as such
discrepencies, observations show evidence for the existence of high mass
outflow winds originating from the vicinity of the active black hole (BH). Such
winds may originate from various parts of the disc and could change the local
accretion rate which should alter the emitted spectral energy distribution
(SED) and affect the global disc luminosity and the BH growth rate. The new
calculations presented here show the effects of several types of winds on the
observed and inferred disc properties. Some wind profiles can have a profound
effect on the observed SED and can perhaps explain the poorly understood
deviations of AGN spectra from standard disc spectra. We show a factor ~2
possible error in estimating the disc luminosity and larger deviations in
estimating L/Ledd. The BH growth rate computed without taking the effects of
wind into account may be significantly over-estimated. We also suggest a
practical way to use the observed SED in order to make first order corrections
to BH growth rate and account for the effects of disc winds.

poor statistics, projection effects and the lack of accurate distances, our
understanding of their dynamical and evolutionary status is still limited. This
is particularly true for the so called Shakhbazyan groups (SHK) which are still
largely unexplored due to the lack of systematic spectroscopic studies of both
their member galaxies and the surrounding environment. In our previous paper,
we investigated the statistical properties of a large sample of SHK groups
using Sloan Digital Sky Survey data and photometric redshifts. Here we present
the follow-up of 5 SHK groups (SHK 10, 71, 75, 80, 259) observed within our
spectroscopic campaign with the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo, aimed at
confirming their physical reality and strengthening our photometric results.
For each of the selected groups we were able to identify between 6 and 13
spectroscopic members, thus confirming the robustness of the photometric
redshift approach in identifying real galaxy over-densities. Consistently with
the finding of our previous paper, the structures studied here have properties
spanning from those of compact and isolated groups to those of loose groups.
For what the global physical properties are concerned (total mass,
mass-to-light ratios, etc.), we find systematic differences with those reported
in the literature by previous studies. Our analysis suggests that previous
results should be revisited; we show in fact that, if the literature data are
re-analysed in a consistent and homogeneous way, the properties obtained are in
agreement with those estimated for our sample.

[X/H] abundance variation is below sigma < 0.03, as expected from a coeval
stellar population preserving natal abundance patterns, supporting the use of
elemental abundances as a probe to reconstruct dispersed clusters. We find
discrepancies between Cr I and Cr II abundances as well as between Ti I and Ti
II abundances, where the ionized abundances are larger by about 0.2 dex. This
follows other such studies which demonstrate the effects of overionization in
cool stars. IC 4756 are supersolar in Mg, Si, Na and Al, but are solar in the
other elements. The fact that IC 4756 is supersolar in some alpha-elements (Mg,
Si) but solar in the others (Ca, Ti) suggests that the production of
alpha-elements is not simply one dimensional and could be exploited for
chemical tagging.

0.6% (M81) to 5.6% (SMC) of the 3.6 micron flux and 1.0% (M81) to 10.1% (SMC)
of the 4.5 micron flux. We find a trend of decreasing AGB contribution with
increasing galaxy metallicity, luminosity and mass and decreasing SSFR.
However, these galaxy properties are strongly correlated in our sample and the
simplest explanation of the trend is galaxy metallicity. Bright, red sources
other than dusty AGB stars represent a smaller fraction of the luminosity,
~1.2% at 3.6 microns, however their dust is likely cooler and their
contributions are likely larger at longer wavelengths. Excluding the SMC, the
contribution from these red sources correlates with the specific star formation
rate as we would expect for massive stars. In total, after correcting for dust
emission at other wavelengths, the dust around AGB stars radiates 0.1-0.8% of
the bolometric luminosities of the galaxies. Thus, hot dust emission from AGB

spectra are so close to the WD that particles directly exposed to starlight
must be heated above 1500 K and are expected to be unstable against
sublimation. To reconcile this expectation with observations we explore
particle sublimation in H-poor debris disks around WDs. We show that because of
the high metal vapor pressure the characteristic sublimation temperature in
these disks is 300-400 K higher than in their protoplanetary analogues,
allowing particles to survive at higher temperatures. We then look at the
structure of the inner edges of debris disks and show that they should
generically feature superheated inner rims directly exposed to starlight with
temperatures reaching 2500-3500 K. Particles migrating through the rim towards
the WD (and rapidly sublimating) shield the disk behind them from strong
stellar heating, making the survival of solids possible close to the WD. Our
model agrees well with observations of WD+disk systems provided that disk
particles are composed of Si-rich material such as olivine, and have sizes in

with quasiparticles defines a fundamental limitation for the qubit coherence.
We develop a theory of the pure dephasing rate \Gamma_{\phi} caused by
quasiparticles tunneling through a Josephson junction and of the inhomogeneous
broadening due to changes in the occupations of Andreev states in the junction.
To estimate \Gamma_{\phi}, we derive a master equation for the qubit dynamics.
The tunneling rate of free quasiparticles is enhanced by their large density of
states at energies close to the superconducting gap. Nevertheless, we find that
\Gamma_{\phi} is small compared to the rates determined by extrinsic factors in
most of the current qubit designs (phase and flux qubits, transmon, fluxonium).
The split transmon, in which a single junction is replaced by a SQUID loop,
represents an exception that could make possible the measurement of
\Gamma_{\phi}. Fluctuations of the qubit frequency leading to inhomogeneous
broadening may be caused by the fluctuations in the occupation numbers of the
Andreev states associated with a phase-biased Josephson junction. This
mechanism may be revealed in qubits with small-area junctions, since the
smallest relative change in frequency it causes is of the order of the inverse
number of transmission channels in the junction.

it is unclear how suitable NDN is for applications that are not obviously

boundary in an unsteady flow based on the Stokes second problem. An increase in
slip is observed in comparison to the steady flow for shear rates below the
critical shear rate of the corresponding steady flow. This increased slip is
attributed to fluid inertial forces not represented in a steady flow. An
unsteady mathematical model for slip is established, which estimates the
increment in slip at the boundary. The model shows that slip is also dependent
on acceleration in addition to the shear rate of fluid at the wall. By writing
acceleration in terms of shear rate, it is shown that slip at the wall in
unsteady flows is governed by the gradient of shear rate and shear rate of the
fluid. Non-dimensionalizing the model gives a universal curve which can be used
to find the slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface based on the
information of shear rate and gradient of shear rate of the fluid. A governing
non-dimensional number, defined as the ratio of phase speed to speed of sound,
is identified to help in explaining the mechanism responsible for the
transition of slip boundary condition from finite to a perfect slip and
determining when this would occur. Phase lag in fluid velocity relative to wall
is observed. The lag increases with decreasing time period of wall oscillation
and increasing wall hydrophobicity. The phenomenon of hysteresis is seen when
looking into the variation of slip velocity as a function of wall velocity and
slip velocity as a function of fluid shear rate. The cause for hysteresis is
attributed to the unsteady inertial forces of the fluid.

a segment of M contacting the solid sphere: the shape is either convex, s=1, or
concave, s=-1.
  For the fixed contact angles the set of the functions H_n^s(\psi) behaves in
such a way that in the plane (\psi,H) there exists a bounded domain where
H_n^s(\psi) do not exist for any distance between solids. The curves
H_n^s(\psi) may be tangent to the boundary of domain which is a smooth closed

of this paper is to define and evaluate an approximation scheme that can be
used to study nuclei that are described as two particles attached to a closed
(sub-)shell nucleus. The equation-of-motion coupled-cluster formalism has been
used to obtain ground and excited state energies. This method is based on the
diagonalization of a non-Hermitian matrix obtained from a similarity
transformation of the many-body nuclear Hamiltonian. A chiral interaction at
the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order using a cutoff at 500 MeV was used.
The ground state energies of ${}^6$Li and ${}^6$He were in good agreement with
a no-core shell-model calculation using the same interaction. Several excited
states were also produced with overall good agreement. Only the $J^\pi=3^+$
excited state in ${}^6$Li showed a sizable deviation. The ground state energies
of ${}^{18}$O, ${}^{18}$F and ${}^{18}$Ne were converged, but underbound
compared to experiment. Moreover, the calculated spectra were converged and
comparable to both experiment and shell-model studies in this region. Some
excited states in ${}^{18}$O were high or missing in the spectrum. It was also
shown that the wave function for both ground and excited states separates into
an intrinsic part and a Gaussian for the center-of-mass coordinate. Spurious

an existing connectivity graph. An edge exists from one node to another in the
reachability graph at time t if there exists a journey (i.e., a spatiotemporal
path) in the connectivity graph from the first node to the second, leaving
after t, with a positive edge traversal time tau, and arriving within a maximum
delay delta. We make three contributions. First, we develop the theoretical
framework around temporal reachability graphs. Second, we harness our
theoretical findings to propose an algorithm for their efficient computation.
Finally, we demonstrate the analytic power of the temporal reachability graph
concept by applying it to synthetic and real-life datasets. On top of defining
clear upper bounds on communication capabilities, reachability graphs highlight
asymmetric communication opportunities and offloading potential.

(planetesimal) bodies. To first order, the torques exerted by the interior and
exterior disks cancel, analogous to the cancellation of the torques from the
gravitational interaction with the gas (type I migration). Assuming the
dispersion-dominated regime and power-laws characterized by indices {\alpha}
and {\beta} for the surface density and eccentricity profiles, we calculate the
net torque on the planet. We consider both distant encounters and close
(orbit-crossing) encounters. We find that the close and distant encounter
torques have opposite signs with respect to their {\alpha} and {\beta}
dependences; and that the torque is especially sensitive to the eccentricity
gradient ({\beta}). Compared to type-I migration due to excitation of density
waves, the planetesimal-driven migration rate is generally lower due to the
lower surface density of solids in gas-rich disk, although this may be
partially or fully offset when their eccentricity and inclination are small.
Allowing for the feedback of the planet on the planetesimal disk through
viscous stirring, we find that under certain conditions a self-regulated
migration scenario emerges, in which the planet migrates at a steady pace that
approaches the rate corresponding to the one-sided torque. If the local
planetesimal disk mass to planet mass ratio is low, however, migration stalls.
We quantify the boundaries separating the three migration regimes.

that the patches from which halos formed are locally biased with respect to the
initial fluctuation field, meaning that the halo-patch fluctuation field can be
written as a Taylor series in that of the dark matter. If quantities other than
the local density influence halo formation, then this Lagrangian bias will
generically be nonlocal; the Taylor series must be performed with respect to
these other variables as well. We illustrate the effect with Monte-Carlo
simulations of a model in which halo formation depends on the local shear (the
quadrupole of perturbation theory), and provide an analytic model which
provides a good description of our results. Our model, which extends the
excursion set approach to walks in more than one dimension, works both when
steps in the walk are uncorrelated, as well as when there are correlations
between steps. For walks with correlated steps, our model includes two distinct
types of nonlocality: one is due to the fact that the initial density profile
around a patch which is destined to form a halo must fall sufficiently steeply
around it -- this introduces k-dependence to even the linear bias factor, but
otherwise only affects the monopole of the clustering signal. The other is due
to the surrounding shear field; this affects the quadratic and higher order
bias factors, and introduces an angular dependence to the clustering signal. In
both cases, our analysis shows that these nonlocal Lagrangian bias terms can be
significant, particularly for massive halos; they must be accounted for in
analyses of higher order clustering such as the halo bispectrum in Lagrangian
or Eulerian space. Although we illustrate these effects using halos, our
analysis and conclusions also apply to the other constituents of the cosmic web
-- filaments, sheets and voids.

excited states in full generality. The inner products between these edge states
are computed in the thermodynamic limit, assuming generalized screening (i.e.
short-range correlations only) inside the quantum Hall droplet, and using the
language of boundary conformal field theory (boundary CFT). These inner
products take universal values in this limit: they are equal to the
corresponding inner products in the bulk 2d chiral CFT which underlies the
trial wavefunction. This is a bulk/edge correspondence; it shows the equality
between equal-time correlators along the edge and the correlators of the bulk
CFT up to a Wick rotation. This approach is then used to analyze the
entanglement spectrum (ES) of the ground state obtained with a bipartition
A\cupB in real-space. Starting from our universal result for inner products in
the thermodynamic limit, we tackle corrections to scaling using standard
field-theoretic and renormalization group arguments. We prove that generalized
screening implies that the entanglement Hamiltonian H_E = - log {\rho}_A is
isospectral to an operator that is local along the cut between A and B. We also
show that a similar analysis can be carried out for particle partition. We
discuss the close analogy between the formalism of trial wavefunctions given by

a classical observer for distinguishing between classical and nonclassical

rest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 um. Star-formation rates are obtained
from spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an AGN

positive correlation between the AGN activity (proxied by the X-ray luminosity)
and the sSFR for the most active systems with X-ray luminosities exceeding
Lx=10^43 erg/s and redshifts z~1. We do not find evidence for such a
correlation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts. We do not
find any correlation between the SFR (or the sSFR) and the X-ray absorption
derived from high-quality XMM-Newton spectra either, showing that the
absorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host,
while the star-formation is not nuclear. Comparing the sSFR of the hosts to the
characteristic sSFR of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift we find that
the AGNs reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the AGN
- sSFR connection. Limiting our analysis to the highest X-ray luminosity AGNs
(X-ray QSOs with Lx>10^44 erg/s), we find that the highest-redshift QSOs (with

data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). This ninth data
release (DR9) of the SDSS project includes 535,995 new galaxy spectra (median
z=0.52), 102,100 new quasar spectra (median z=2.32), and 90,897 new stellar
spectra, along with the data presented in previous data releases. These spectra
were obtained with the new BOSS spectrograph and were taken between 2009
December and 2011 July. In addition, the stellar parameters pipeline, which
determines radial velocities, surface temperatures, surface gravities, and
metallicities of stars, has been updated and refined with improvements in
temperature estimates for stars with T_eff<5000 K and in metallicity estimates
for stars with [Fe/H]>-0.5. DR9 includes new stellar parameters for all stars
presented in DR8, including stars from SDSS-I and II, as well as those observed
as part of the SDSS-III Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and
Exploration-2 (SEGUE-2).
  The astrometry error introduced in the DR8 imaging catalogs has been
corrected in the DR9 data products. The next data release for SDSS-III will be
in Summer 2013, which will present the first data from the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) along with another year of
data from BOSS, followed by the final SDSS-III data release in December 2014.

the relative motion between large particles and a turbulent flow. This
definition is necessary because the slip velocity used in the standard drag
model fails when particle size falls within the inertial subrange of ambient
turbulence. We propose two definitions, selected in part due to their
simplicity: they do not require filtration of the fluid phase velocity field,
nor do they require the construction of conditional averages on particle
locations. A key benefit of this simplicity is that the stochastic slip
velocity proposed here can be calculated equally well for laboratory, field,
and numerical experiments. The stochastic slip velocity allows the definition
of a Reynolds number that should indicate whether large particles in turbulent
flow behave (a) as passive tracers; (b) as a linear filter of the velocity
field; or (c) as a nonlinear filter to the velocity field. We calculate the
value of stochastic slip for ellipsoidal and spherical particles (the size of
the Taylor microscale) measured in laboratory homogeneous isotropic turbulence.
The resulting Reynolds number is significantly higher than 1 for both particle
shapes, and velocity statistics show that particle motion is a complex
non-linear function of the fluid velocity. We further investigate the nonlinear
relationship by comparing the probability distribution of fluctuating
velocities for particle and fluid phases.

energy, causing unusually high magnetovolume effects of $\Delta M/\Delta a$ ~
4.3 $\mu_B$/\AA as well as a Stoner instability [IN(0) ~ 1.2]. At the optimized

but the combined effects of the p-d hybridization, the magnetovolume, and the

domain theory has a role to play in the capacity of channels; in particular,
the (n x n)-stochastic matrices, which are the classical channels having the
same sized input as output, admit a quotient compact ordered space which is a
domain, and the capacity map factors through this quotient via a
Scott-continuous map that measures the quotient domain. We also comment on how

controls the charge gap. The magnetic structure was found to be an out-of-plane

was developed for studying pattern generation problems. The entropy and the
Minkowski dimensions of general multiplicative systems can thus be computed. A
multi-dimensional decoupled system is investigated in three main steps. (I)
Identify the admissible lattices of the system; (II) compute the density of
copies of admissible lattices of the same length, and (III) compute the number
of admissible patterns on the admissible lattices.
  A coupled system can be decoupled by removing the multiplicative relation set
and then performing procedures similar to those applied to a decoupled system .
The admissible lattices are chosen to be the\ maximum graphs of different
degrees which are mutually independent. The entropy can be obtained after the
remaining error term is shown to approach zero as the degree of the admissible
lattice tends to infinity.

investigate the Nf=4, 8 and 12 flavor SU(3) systems at several couplings near

equivalently, on the running coupling). This energy dependence can be explored
even with fixed lattice parameters (bare coupling and mass). We find that for
the 4 flavor system the mass anomalous dimension decreases as the energy
increases, consistent with perturbative expectations. For the 8 flavor system
the energy dependence is too weak to be observable at present. The 12 flavor
system at our strongest couplings shows the anomalous dimension increasing with
energy, consistent with backward flow and the presence of an infrared fixed

work, the Lagrangian formulation of an electrostatic field in three spatial

$\beta'=2\beta$ up to first order over deformation parameter $\beta$. It is
shown that there is a similarity between electrostatics in the presence of a
minimal length (modified electrostatics) and higher derivative Podolsky's
electrostatics. The important property of this modified electrostatics is that
the classical self-energy of a point charge becomes a finite value. Two
different upper bounds on the isotropic minimal length of this modified
electrostatics are estimated. The first upper bound will be found by treating
the modified electrostatics as a classical electromagnetic system, while the
second one will be estimated by considering the modified electrostatics as a
quantum field theoretic model. It should be noted that the quantum upper bound

waves in the frequency range [50, 1190] Hz and with frequency derivative ranges
of [-2 x 10^-9, 1.1 x 10^-10] Hz/s for the fifth LIGO science run (S5). The
novelty of the search lies in the use of a non-coherent technique based on the
Hough-transform to combine the information from coherent searches on timescales
of about one day. Because these searches are very computationally intensive,
they have been deployed on the Einstein@Home distributed computing project
infrastructure. The search presented here is about a factor 3 more sensitive
than the previous Einstein@Home search in early S5 LIGO data. The
post-processing has left us with eight surviving candidates. We show that
deeper follow-up studies rule each of them out. Hence, since no statistically
significant gravitational wave signals have been detected, we report upper
limits on the intrinsic gravitational wave amplitude h0. For example, in the
0.5 Hz-wide band at 152.5 Hz, we can exclude the presence of signals with h0
greater than 7.6 x 10^-25 with a 90% confidence level.

rules on explicit bosonic realization of level -1 modules for the affine Lie

for these representations, and the corresponding decomposition for $\ell \ge
3$. We also obtain the complete reducibility of the associated level -1 modules
for affine Lie algebra of type $C_{\ell}^{(1)}$. Next we notice that the
category of $D_{2 \ell -1}^{(1)}$ modules at level $- 2 \ell +3 $ obtained in
Per\v{s}e (2012) has the isomorphic fusion algebra. This enables us to
decompose certain $E_6 ^{(1)}$ and $F_4 ^{(1)}$--modules at negative levels.

the conditions under which icy planetesimals formed and can provide clues to
the contribution of comets to the delivery of water and other volatiles to
Earth. Available measurements suggest that there is isotopic diversity in the
comet population. The Herschel Space Observatory revealed an ocean-like ratio
in the Jupiter-family comet 103P/Hartley 2, whereas most values measured in
Oort-cloud comets are twice as high as the ocean D/H ratio. We present here a
new measurement of the D/H ratio in the water of an Oort-cloud comet. HDO,
H_2O, and H_2^18O lines were observed with high signal-to-noise ratio in comet
C/2009 P1 (Garradd) using the Herschel HIFI instrument. Spectral maps of two
water lines were obtained to constrain the water excitation. The D/H ratio
derived from the measured H_2^16O and HDO production rates is 2.06+/-0.22 X
10**-4. This result shows that the D/H in the water of Oort-cloud comets is not
as high as previously thought, at least for a fraction of the population, hence
the paradigm of a single, archetypal D/H ratio for all Oort-cloud comets is no
longer tenable. Nevertheless, the value measured in C/2009 P1 (Garradd) is
significantly higher than the Earth's ocean value of 1.558 X 10**-4. The
measured H_2^16O/H_2^18O ratio of 523+/-32 is, however, consistent with the
terrestrial value.

shearing motions couple to the non--ideal effects, destabilising low frequency
fluctuations in the medium. The origin of this non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic
instability lies in the collisional coupling of the neutral particles to the
magnetized plasma in the presence of a sheared background flow. Unsurprisingly,
the maximum growth rate and most unstable wavenumber depend on the flow
gradient and ambient diffusivities.
  The orientation of the magnetic field, velocity shears and perturbation wave
vector play a crucial role in assisting the instability. When the magnetic
field and wave vector are both vertical, ambipolar and Ohm diffusion can be
combined as Pedersen diffusion and cause only damping; in this case only Hall
drift in tandem with shear flow drives the instability. However, for
non-vertical fields and oblique wave vectors, both ambipolar diffusion and Hall
drift are destabilizing.
  We investigate the stability of magnetic elements in the network and
internetwork regions. The shear scale is not yet observationally determined,
but assuming a typical shear flow gradient $\sim 0.1 \,\mbox{s}^{-1}$ we show
that the magnetic diffusion shear instability grows on a time scale of one
minute. Thus, it is plausible that network--internetwork magnetic elements are
subject to this fast growing, diffusive shear instability, which could play an
important role in driving low frequency turbulence in the plasma in the solar
photosphere and chromosphere.

Synthesis Radio Telescope(WSRT) have been reported. These observations were
made towards nearby positions where already hydrogen lines were detected at
sufficiently high intensity($\geq$50mK) at 1.4 GHz. This approach gave a fair
chance for the detection of helium line as well, keeping in mind the relative
abundance(10%) of helium with respect to hydrogen. Care was also taken to avoid
the presence of HII regions along the line of sight so that the line emission
originates from the extended diffuse low density ionized component, ELDWIM of
the Galaxy. The observations have resulted in the detection of helium line
towards 5 positions out of 11 with signal to noise ratio(snr) $>$ 4$\sigma$. An
attempt has been made to associate detection/non-detection of helium line to
the presence of surrounding HII regions. A weighting scheme that accounts for
nearby($<$ 500pc) HII regions, their distances and other factors produces
favourable results. It is seen from this weighting scheme that a higher weight
favours the detection of helium line while lower weight is associated with
non-detection. The idea is to correlate ionization of ELDWIM with the

similar to that of the $N$-fold way method. By using a list of sites into which
we can insert a particle, we avoid trying a useless transition which is
forbidden by the constraint conditions. We applied the present method to a
lattice glass model proposed by Biroli and M{\'e}zard. We first evaluated the
efficiency of the method through measurements of the autocorrelation function

higher than that of the standard Monte-Carlo method. We also compared the

as the replica exchange method and the Wang-Landau method is inflnuenced by the
choice of the local update method. The results show that the efficiency is
considerably improved by the use of efficient local update methods. For
example, when the number of sites $N_{\rm site}$ is 1024, the ergodic time
$\tau_{\rm E}$ of the replica exchange method in the grand-canonical ensemble,
which is the average round-trip time of a replica in chemical-potential space,
with the present local update method is more than $10^2$ times shorter than

three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations of this outflow-from-inflow
scenario. By comparison with observations, our results can be used to test the
theoretical models and guide future numerical simulations. We predict both
absorption and emission features, most of which are formed in a polar funnel of
outflowing gas. This outflow causes strong absorption for observer orientation
angles of < 35 degrees. Particularly in 3D, the strength of this absorption
varies significantly for different lines-of-sight owing to the fragmentary
structure of the gas flow. Although infalling material occupies a large
fraction of the simulation volume, we do not find that it imprints strong
absorption features since the ionization state is very high. Thus, an absence
of observed inflow absorption features does not exclude the models. The main
spectroscopic consequence of the infalling gas is a scattered continuum
component that partially re-fills the absorption features caused by the
outflowing polar funnel. Fluorescence and scattering in the outflow is
predicted to give rise to several emission features for all observer
orientations. For the hydrodynamical simulations considered we find both
ionization states and column densities for the outflowing gas that are too high
to be quantitatively consistent with well-observed X-ray absorption systems.
Nevertheless, our results are qualitatively encouraging and further exploration

synaptic bonds, as there is evidence that biological synaptic transitions might
occur in a discrete stepwise fashion. Second, the possibility that in the
mammalian brain, unused, silent synapses might be pruned in the long-term.
Besides the usual pattern and network capacities, we calculate the synaptic
capacity of the model, a recently proposed measure where only the functional
subset of synapses is taken into account. We find that in terms of network
capacity, Willshaw learning is strongly affected by the pattern coding rates,
which have to be kept fixed and very low at any time to achieve a non-zero
capacity in the large network limit. The information carried per functional

positive activation energy that depends on its type. There is no binding energy
between particles of the same type. At the boundary of the box particles are
created and annihilated in a way that represents the presence of an infinite
gas reservoir. We start the dynamics from the empty box and are interested in
the transition time to the full box. This transition is triggered by a critical
droplet appearing somewhere in the box. In the first paper we identified the
parameter range for which the system is metastable, showed that the first
entrance distribution on the set of critical droplets is uniform, computed the
expected transition time up to and including a multiplicative factor of order
one, and proved that the nucleation time divided by its expectation is
exponentially distributed, all in the limit of low temperature. These results
were proved under three hypotheses, and involved three model-dependent
quantities: the energy, the shape and the number of critical droplets. Here
prove the third hypothesis and identify the shape and the number of critical

to show the existence of periodic surface water waves with vorticity in order
that it becomes suited to a stability analysis. This is achieved by enlarging
the function space to a class of stream functions that do not correspond
necessarily to travelling profiles. In particular, for smooth profiles and
smooth stream functions, the normal component of the velocity field at the free
boundary is not required a priori to vanish in some Galilean coordinate system.
Travelling periodic waves are obtained by a direct minimisation of a functional
that corresponds to the total energy and that is therefore preserved by the
time-dependent evolutionary problem (this minimisation appears in Burton and
Toland after a first maximisation). In addition, we not only use the
circulation along the upper boundary as a constraint, but also the total
horizontal impulse (the velocity becoming a Lagrange multiplier). This allows
us to preclude parallel flows by choosing appropriately the values of these two
constraints and the sign of the vorticity. By stability, we mean conditional
energetic stability of the set of minimizers as a whole, the perturbations

SMBH feedback simulations to date showing that quasar's effects on galaxies are
not always negative. We find that when the ambient shocked gas cools rapidly,
the shocked gas is compressed into thin cold dense shells, filaments and
clumps. Driving these high density features out is much more difficult than
analytical models predict since dense filaments are resilient to the feedback.
However, in this regime quasars have another way of affecting the host -- by
triggering a massive star formation burst in the cold gas by over-pressurising
it. Under these conditions SMBHs actually accelerate star formation in the
host, having a positive rather than negative effect on their host galaxies. The
relationship between SMBH and galaxies is thus even more complex and symbiotic
than currently believed. We also suggest that the instabilities found here may

($\sim 200 M_\odot$), the flux of ionizing photons is strong enough to
considerably reduce the gas density in the ionization zone, and the typical
lifetimes of stars ($\sim 2$ Myr) are insufficient for the growth of
instabilities. The gas in a protogalaxy with $M\sim 10^7 M_\odot$ with a 200

in the case of a 120 $M_\odot$ central star, only one-third of the total mass

be simply related to the FT of these variations. This procedure was applied to
more than 100 different chemical structures, inspired by the exhaustive

unique in-plane configuration, we identify two distinct phases in the space of
carrier density and magnetic field. At high densities and fields, the
electronic system is strongly polarized and shows a response, which is highly
anisotropic along the crystalline directions. Surprisingly, below a
density-dependent critical field, the polarization and anisotropy vanish
whereas the resistivity sharply rises. The unprecedented vanishing of the easy
axes below a critical field is in sharp contrast with other coupled magnetic
systems and indicates strong coupling with the moments that depends on the
symmetry of the itinerant electrons. The observed interplay between the two
phases indicates the nature of magnetism at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface as both

light Higgs mass at the LHC. SO(10)-like relations are assumed for neutrino
Dirac Yukawa couplings and two cases of mixing, one large, PMNS-like, and
another small, CKM-like, are considered. It is shown that for the large mixing
case, only a small range of parameter space with moderate $\tan \beta$ is still
allowed. This remaining region can be ruled out by an order of magnitude
improvement in the current limit on BR($\mu \to e + \gamma$). We also explore a
model with non-universal Higgs mass boundary conditions at the high scale. It
is shown that the renormalization group induced flavor violating slepton mass
terms are highly sensitive to the Higgs boundary conditions. Depending on the
choice of the parameters, they can either lead to strong enhancements or
cancellations within the flavor violating terms. Such cancellations might relax
the severe constraints imposed by lepton flavor violation compared to mSUGRA.
Nevertheless for a large region of parameter space the predicted rates lie
within the reach of future experiments once the light Higgs mass constraint is
imposed. We also update the potential of the ongoing and future experimental
searches for lepton flavor violation in constraining the supersymmetric
parameter space.

unclear how much synchrony is caused by afferent synchronized events and how
much is intrinsic due to the connectivity structure of cortex. The available
analytical approaches based on the diffusion approximation do not allow to
model spike synchrony, preventing a thorough analysis. Here we theoretically
investigate to what extent common synaptic afferents and synchronized inputs
each contribute to closely time-locked spiking activity of pairs of neurons. We
employ direct simulation and extend earlier analytical methods based on the
diffusion approximation to pulse-coupling, allowing us to introduce precisely
timed correlations in the spiking activity of the synaptic afferents. We
investigate the transmission of correlated synaptic input currents by pairs of
integrate-and-fire model neurons, so that the same input covariance can be
realized by common inputs or by spiking synchrony. We identify two distinct
regimes: In the limit of low correlation linear perturbation theory accurately
determines the correlation transmission coefficient, which is typically smaller
than unity, but increases sensitively even for weakly synchronous inputs. In
the limit of high afferent correlation, in the presence of synchrony a
qualitatively new picture arises. As the non-linear neuronal response becomes
dominant, the output correlation becomes higher than the total correlation in
the input. This transmission coefficient larger unity is a direct consequence
of non-linear neural processing in the presence of noise, elucidating how
synchrony-coded signals benefit from these generic properties present in
cortical networks.

surprisingly, some hot Jupiters have been reported to exhibit transit timing
variations (TTVs). The aim of this paper is to identify the origin of these
observations, identify possible periodic biases leading to false TTV
detections, and refine the sample to a few candidates with likely dynamical
TTVs. Methods. We present TTV frequencies and amplitudes of hot Jupiters in
Kepler Q0--6 data with Fourier analysis and a frequency-dependent bootstrap
calculation to assess the false alarm probability levels of the detections.
Results. We identified 36 systems with TTV above four standard deviation
confidence, about half of them exhibiting multiple TTV frequencies. Fifteen of
these objects (HAT-P-7b, KOI-13, 127, 183, 188, 190, 196, 225, 254, 428, 607,
609, 684, 774, 1176) probably show TTVs due to a systematic observational
effect: long cadence data sampling is regularly shifted transit-by-transit,
interacting with the transit light curves, introducing a periodic bias, and
leading to a stroboscopic period. For other systems, the activity and rotation
of the host star can modulate light curves and explain the observed TTVs. By
excluding the systems that were inadequately sampled, showed TTV periods
related to the stellar rotation, or turned out to be false positives or
suspects, we ended up with seven systems. Three of them (KOI-186, 897, 977)
show the weakest stellar rotation features, and these are our best candidates
for dynamically induced TTV variations. Conclusions. Those systems with
periodic TTVs that we cannot explain with systematics from observation, stellar
rotation, activity, or inadequate sampling may be multiple systems or even
exomoon hosts.

dependent energy and mass input according to stellar evolutionary tracks. We
vary the position of the three stars relative to each other to compare the
energy response for cases of isolated, merging and initially cospatial bubbles.
Due to mainly the Vishniac instability, our simulated bubbles develop thick
shells and filamentary internal structures in column density. The shell widths
reach tens of per cent of the outer bubble radius, which compares favourably to
observations. More energy is retained in the ISM for more closely packed
groups, by up to a factor of three and typically a factor of two for
intermediate times after the first supernova. Once the superbubble is
established, different positions of the contained stars make only a minor
difference to the energy tracks. For our case of three massive stars, the
energy deposition varies only very little for distances up to about 30 pc
between the stars. Energy injected by supernovae is entirely dissipated in a
superbubble on a timescale of about 1 Myr, which increases slightly with the
superbubble size at the time of the explosion. The Vishniac instability may be
responsible for the broadening of the shells of interstellar bubbles. Massive
star winds are significant energetically due to their - in the long run - more
efficient, steady energy injection and because they evacuate the space around
the massive stars. For larger scale simulations, the feedback effect of close
groups of stars or clusters may be subsumed into one effective energy input
with insignificant loss of energy accuracy.

coherent transport regime with a strong coupling throughout the junction and a
Coulomb blockade regime in which the molecule is only weakly coupled to both
leads. The former case where the tunnelling barrier is considered to be
delocalized across the system can be well described with common mean-field
techniques based on density functional theory (DFT), while the latter case with
its two distinct barriers localized at the interfaces usually requires a
multideterminant description. There is a third scenario with just one barrier
localized inside the molecule which we investigate here using a variety of
quantum-chemical methods by studying partial charge shifts in biphenyl radical
ions induced by an electric field at different angles to modulate the coupling
and thereby the barrier within the $\pi$-system. We find steps rounded off at
the edges in the charge versus field curves for weak and intermediate coupling,
whose accurate description requires a correct treatment of both exchange and
dynamical correlation effects is essential. We establish that DFT standard
functionals fail to reproduce this feature, while a long range corrected hybrid
functional fares much better, which makes it a reasonable choice for a proper

incompletely synapse specific (""crosstalk"") might be analogous to genetic
mutations. We analyze aspects of the effect of crosstalk in Hebbian learning
using the classical Oja model.
  Methods: In previous work we showed that crosstalk leads to learning of the
principal eigenvector of EC (the input covariance matrix pre-multiplied by an
error matrix that describes the crosstalk pattern), and found that with
positive input correlations increasing crosstalk smoothly degrades performance.
However, the Oja model requires negative input correlations to account for
biological ocular segregation. Although this assumption is biologically
somewhat implausible, it captures features that are seen in more complex
models. Here, we analyze how crosstalk would affect such segregation.
  Results: We show that for statistically unbiased inputs crosstalk induces a
bifurcation from segregating to non-segregating outcomes at a critical value
which depends on correlations. We also investigate the behavior in the vicinity
of this critical state and for weakly biased inputs.
  Conclusions: Our results show that crosstalk can induce a bifurcation under
special conditions even in the simplest Hebbian models and that even the low
levels of crosstalk observed in the brain could prevent normal development.
However, during learning pairwise input statistics are more complex and
crosstalk-induced bifurcations may not occur in the Oja model. Such
bifurcations would be analogous to ""error catastrophes"" in genetic models, and
we argue that they are usually absent for simple linear Hebbian learning
because such learning is only driven by pairwise correlations.

100 MeV to 10 GeV range has been detected from more than a dozen globular
clusters in our galaxy, including 47 Tucanae and Terzan 5. Based on a sample of
known gamma-ray globular clusters, the empirical relations between gamma-ray
luminosity and properties of globular clusters such as their stellar encounter
rate, metallicity, and possible optical and infrared photon energy densities,

power law with a cut-off at a few gigaelectronvolts. Together with the
detection of pulsed gamma-rays from two MSPs in two different globular
clusters, such spectral signature lends support to the hypothesis that
gamma-rays from globular clusters represent collective curvature emission from
magnetospheres of MSPs in the clusters. Alternative models, involving
Inverse-Compton (IC) emission of relativistic electrons that are accelerated
close to MSPs or pulsar wind nebula shocks, have also been suggested.

moduli of the HSP evaluated by the MEFM are sensitive to both the relative size
of the inclusions (i.e., their multimodal nature) and the RDFs estimated from

critical for any nonlinear localized phenomena such as onset of yielding,

mimicked, counter-intuitively, by polarized photons in a quantum nonlinear

circumnuclear megamaser disk from four observations with the Very Long Baseline
Array, the Green Bank Telescope and the Effelsberg Telescope. We also monitored
the maser spectral profile for 2.3 years using the Green Bank Telescope to
measure accelerations of maser lines by tracking their line-of-sight velocities
as they change with time. The measured accelerations suggest that the systemic
maser spots have a significantly wider radial distribution than in the
archetypal megamaser in NGC 4258. We model the maser emission as arising from a
circumnuclear disk with orbits dominated by the central black hole. The best
fit of the data gives a Hubble constant of $H_{0} =$ 68$\pm$9 km s$^{-1}$
Mpc$^{-1}$, which corresponds to an angular-diameter distance of 144$\pm$19
Mpc. In addition, the fit also gives a mass of the central black hole of

countries, are often driven by individual beliefs and sentiments about health
and disease. Individual behaviors affecting health outcomes are increasingly
modulated by social networks, for example through the associations of
like-minded individuals - homophily - or through peer influence effects. Using
a statistical approach to measure the individual temporal effects of a large
number of variables pertaining to social network statistics, we investigate the
spread of a health sentiment towards a new vaccine on Twitter, a large online
social network. We find that the effects of neighborhood size and exposure
intensity are qualitatively very different depending on the type of sentiment.
Generally, we find that larger numbers of opinionated neighbors inhibit the
expression of sentiments. We also find that exposure to negative sentiment is
contagious - by which we merely mean predictive of future negative sentiment
expression - while exposure to positive sentiments is generally not. In fact,
exposure to positive sentiments can even predict increased negative sentiment
expression. Our results suggest that the effects of peer influence and social
contagion on the dynamics of behavioral spread on social networks are strongly
content-dependent.

time with a fixed time delay, which we call hard delay. For weak noise, the
rates of inter-attractor switching and extinction are exponentially small.
Finding these rates to logarithmic accuracy is reduced to variational problems.
The solutions of the variational problems give the most probable paths followed
in switching or extinction. We show that the equations for the most probable

general results are obtained for small delay compared to the relaxation rate.
We also develop a direct variational method to find the rates. We find that the

dephasing. We have shown that an enhancement of the induced nonlinearity can be
achieved by two order of the magnitude with a negative interaction strength
which implies a large negative qubit-field detuning as well. Bright solitons
are found to be supported under perturbations only in the upper (optical)
branch of polaritons, for which the corresponding group velocity is controlled
by tuning the interacting strength. With the help of perturbation theory for
solitons, we also demonstrate that the group velocity of these polariton
solitons is suppressed by the diffusion process.

can be correlated in time. We characterize the system throughput asymptotically
in n. Specifically, we explicitly show how the throughput behaves for different
values of the coding block size K as a function of n, as n approaches infinity.
For finite values of K and n, under the more restrictive assumption of
Gilbert-Elliott channels, we are able to provide a lower bound on the maximum
achievable throughput. Using simulations we show the tightness of the bound
with respect to system parameters n and K, and find that its performance is
significantly better than the previously known lower bounds.

methodology, which is a recently-developed heuristic approach to optimization,
and to discuss its applicability to medical physics problem formulations that
specify the desired solution (of physically given or otherwise obtained
constraints) by an optimization criterion. Methods: The underlying idea is that
many iterative algorithms for finding such a solution are perturbation
resilient in the sense that, even if certain kinds of changes are made at the
end of each iterative step, the algorithm still produces a
constraints-compatible solution. This property is exploited by using permitted
changes to steer the algorithm to a solution that is not only
constraints-compatible, but is also desirable according to a specified
optimization criterion. The approach is very general, it is applicable to many
iterative procedures and optimization criteria used in medical physics.
Results: The main practical contribution is a procedure for automatically
producing from any given iterative algorithm its superiorized version, which
will supply solutions that are superior according to a given optimization
criterion. It is shown that if the original iterative algorithm satisfies
certain mathematical conditions, then the output of its superiorized version is
guaranteed to be as constraints-compatible as the output of the original
algorithm, but it is superior to the latter according to the optimization
criterion. This intuitive description is made precise in the paper and the
stated claims are rigorously proved. Superiorization is illustrated on
simulated computerized tomography data of a head cross-section and, in spite of
its generality, superiorization is shown to be competitive to an optimization
algorithm that is specifically designed to minimize total variation.

consistent description of the symmetries of dynamical systems at different
times and the symmetries of the various parts of such systems, we introduce
discrete analogs of the gauge connections. Gauge structures are particularly
important to describe the quantum behavior. We show that quantum behavior is
the result of a fundamental inability to trace the identity of
indistinguishable objects in the process of evolution. Information is available
only on invariant statements and values, relating to such objects. Using
mathematical arguments of a general nature we can show that any quantum
dynamics can be reduced to a sequence of permutations. Quantum interferences
occur in the invariant subspaces of permutation representations of symmetry
groups of dynamical systems. The observable values can be expressed in terms of
permutation invariants. We also show that for the description of quantum
phenomena, instead of a nonconstructive number system --- the field of complex
numbers, it is enough to use cyclotomic fields --- the minimal extentions of
natural numbers suitable for quantum mechanics. Finite groups of symmetries
play a central role in this article. The interest in such groups has an
additional motivation in physics. Numerous experiments and observations in
particle physics point to an important role of finite groups of relatively low
orders in a number of fundamental processes.
