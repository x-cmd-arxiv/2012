a single white dwarf (WD) accreting from a non-degenerate companion (the SD
channel) or the result of two merging WDs (DD channel). However, no consensus
currently exists as to which progenitor scenario is the correct one, or whether
the observed SN Ia rate is produced by a combination of both channels. Unlike a
DD progenitor a SD progenitor is expected to emit supersoft X-rays for a
prolonged period of time (~1 Myr) as a result of the burning of accreted matter
on the surface of the WD. An argument against the SD channel as a significant
producer of SNe type Ia has been the lack of observed supersoft X-ray sources
(SSS) and the lower-than-expected integrated soft X-ray flux from elliptical
galaxies.
  We wish to determine if it is possible to obscure the supersoft X-ray
emission from a nuclear burning white dwarf in an accreting single degenerate
binary system. In case of obscured systems we wish to determine their general
observational characteristics.
  We examine the emergent X-ray emission from a canonical SSS system surrounded
by a spherically symmetric configuration of material, assuming a black body
spectrum with T_BB=50 eV and L=10^38 erg/s. The circumbinary material is
assumed to be of solar chemical abundances, and we leave the mechanism behind
the mass loss into the circumbinary region unspecified.
  If steadily accreting, nuclear burning WDs are canonical SSS our analysis
suggests that they can be obscured by relatively modest circumbinary mass loss
rates. This may explain the discrepancy of SSS compared to the SN Ia rate
inferred from observations if the SD progenitor scenario contributes
significantly to the SN Ia rate. Recycled emissions from obscured systems may
be visible in other wavebands than X-rays. It may also explain the lack of
observed SSS in symbiotic binary systems.

of relay nodes (for establishing a packet communication path with a control

consider a model, where a deployment operative steps along a random lattice
path whose evolution is Markov. At each step, the path can randomly either
continue in the same direction or take a turn ""North"" or ""East,"" or come to an
end, at which point a data source (e.g., a temperature sensor) has to be placed
that will send packets to a control centre at the origin of the path. A
decision has to be made at each step whether or not to place a wireless relay
node. Assuming that the packet generation rate by the source is very low, and
simple link-by-link scheduling, we consider the problem of relay placement so
as to minimize the expectation of an end-to-end cost metric (a linear
combination of the sum of convex hop costs and the number of relays placed).
This impromptu relay placement problem is formulated as a total cost Markov
decision process. First, we derive the optimal policy in terms of an optimal
placement set and show that this set is characterized by a boundary beyond
which it is optimal to place. Next, based on a simpler alternative
one-step-look-ahead characterization of the optimal policy, we propose an
algorithm which is proved to converge to the optimal placement set in a finite
number of steps and which is faster than the traditional value iteration. We
show by simulations that the distance based heuristic, usually assumed in the
literature, is close to the optimal provided that the threshold distance is

covariance matrices of power spectra and bispectra of all triangle
configurations. In addition to the known contributions which extend up to
six-point correlation functions, we propose a new contribution `the halo sample
variance (HSV)' arising from the coupling of the lensing Fourier modes with
large-scale mass fluctuations on scales comparable with the survey region via
halo bias theory. We show that the model predictions are in good agreement with
the simulation once we take the HSV into account. The HSV gives a dominant
contribution to the covariance matrices at multipoles l > 10^3, which arises
from massive haloes with a mass of > 10^14 solar mass and at relatively low
redshifts z < 0.4. Since such haloes are easily identified from a multi-colour
imaging survey, the effect can be estimated from the data. By adding the
bispectrum to the power spectrum, the total information content or the
cumulative signal-to-noise ratio up to a certain maximum multipole of a few
10^3 is improved by 20--50 per cent, which is equivalent to a factor of
1.4--2.3 larger survey area for the power spectrum measurement alone. However,
it is still smaller than the case of a Gaussian field by a factor of 3 mostly
due to the HSV. Thus bispectrum measurements are useful for cosmology, but
using information from upcoming surveys requires that non-Gaussian covariances
are carefully estimated.

confirms the importance of thresholding for noisy GGD signals. We provide the
optimum soft thresholding value that mimics the behavior of the Bayes estimator
and minimizes the resulting error.
  The value of the threshold in BayesShrink, which is one of the most used and
efficient soft thresholding methods, has been provided heuristically in the
literature. Our proposed method, denoted by Rigorous BayesShrink
(R-BayesShrink), explains the theory of BayesShrink threshold and proves its
optimality for a subclass of GDD signals. R-BayesShrink improves and
generalizes the existing BayesShrink for the class of GGD signals. While the
BayesShrink threshold is independent from the wavelet coefficient distribution
and is just a function of noise and noiseless signal variance, our method
adapts to the distribution of wavelet coefficients of each scale. It is shown
that BayesShrink is a special case of our method when shape parameter in GGD is
one or signal follows Laplace distribution. Our simulation results confirm the
optimality of R-BayesShrink in GGD denoising with regards to Peak Signal to

South Pole, is an air shower array with an area of 1 km2. The detector allows a
detailed exploration of the mass composition of primary cosmic rays in the
energy range from about 100 TeV to 1 EeV by exploiting the correlation between
the shower energy measured in IceTop and the energy deposited by muons in the
deep ice. In this paper we report on the technical design, construction and

framework for calibration, reconstruction and simulation. Finally the first
experience from commissioning and operating the detector and the performance as
an air shower detector will be discussed.

trees and multiple sequence alignments from unaligned molecular sequences. This
problem is generally formulated in terms of string-valued evolutionary
processes along the branches of a phylogenetic tree. The classical evolutionary
process, the TKF91 model, is a continuous-time Markov chain model comprised of
insertion, deletion and substitution events. Unfortunately this model gives
rise to an intractable computational problem---the computation of the marginal
likelihood under the TKF91 model is exponential in the number of taxa. In this
work, we present a new stochastic process, the Poisson Indel Process (PIP), in
which the complexity of this computation is reduced to linear. The new model is
closely related to the TKF91 model, differing only in its treatment of
insertions, but the new model has a global characterization as a Poisson
process on the phylogeny. Standard results for Poisson processes allow key
computations to be decoupled, which yields the favorable computational profile
of inference under the PIP model. We present illustrative experiments in which
Bayesian inference under the PIP model is compared to separate inference of
phylogenies and alignments.

executing any top-1 query on S rather than D is minimally perceptible to any

  We adapt known geometric ideas of top-k depth contours and the reverse top-k

the optimality of regret minimizing sets using L2 distance. We design an
O(cn^2) plane sweep algorithm for two dimensions to compute an optimal regret

baryon asymmetry of the universe as its realization depends on the presence at
the weak scale of new particles which may be searched for at high energy
colliders. In the MSSM it may only be realized in the presence of light stops,
and with moderate or small mixing between the left- and right-handed
components. Consistency with the observed Higgs mass around 125 GeV demands the
heavier stop mass to be much larger than the weak scale. Moreover the lighter
stop leads to an increase of the gluon-gluon fusion Higgs production cross
section which seems to be in contradiction with indications from current LHC
data. We show that this tension may be considerably relaxed in the presence of
a light neutralino with a mass lower than about 60 GeV, satisfying all present
experimental constraints. In such a case the Higgs may have a significant
invisible decay width and the stop decays through a three or four body decay
channel, including a bottom quark and the lightest neutralino in the final

to bulk logarithmic conformal field theories (LCFTs). We concentrate on the
closed $gl(1|1)$ spin-chain and its continuum limit - the $c=-2$ symplectic
fermions theory - and rely on two technical companion papers, ""Continuum limit
and symmetries of the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain"" [Nucl. Phys. B 871 (2013)
245-288] and ""Bimodule structure in the periodic gl(1|1) spin chain"" [Nucl.
Phys. B 871 (2013) 289-329]. Our main result is that the algebra of local
Hamiltonians, the Jones-Temperley-Lieb algebra JTL_N, goes over in the
continuum limit to a bigger algebra than the product of the left and right
Virasoro algebras. This algebra, S - which we call interchiral, mixes the left
and right moving sectors, and is generated, in the symplectic fermions case, by
the additional field $S(z,\bar{z})=S_{ab}\psi^a(z)\bar{\psi}^b(\bar{z})$, with
a symmetric form $S_{ab}$ and conformal weights (1,1). We discuss in details
how the Hilbert space of the LCFT decomposes onto representations of this
algebra, and how this decomposition is related with properties of the finite
spin-chain. We show that there is a complete correspondence between algebraic
properties of finite periodic spin chains and the continuum limit. An important
technical aspect of our analysis involves the fundamental new observation that
the action of JTL_N in the $gl(1|1)$ spin chain is in fact isomorphic to an
enveloping algebra of a certain Lie algebra, itself a non semi-simple version
of $sp(N-2)$. The semi-simple part of JTL_N is represented by $Usp(N-2)$,
providing a beautiful example of a classical Howe duality, for which we have a
non semi-simple version in the full JTL image represented in the spin-chain. On
the continuum side, simple modules over the interchiral algebra S are
identified with ""fundamental"" representations of $sp(\infty)$.

of response in the core of the optical recombination lines on short timescales,
(ii) the enhanced red-wing response on short timescales, (iii) differences
between the measured delays for the HILs and LILs, and (iv) identifies
turbulence as a means of producing Lorentzian profiles (esp. for LILs) in low
inclination systems, and for suppressing significant continuum--emission-line
delays between the line wings and line core (esp. in LILs). A key motivation of
this work was to reveal the physical underpinnings of the reported measurements
of SMBH masses and their uncertainties. We find that SMBH masses derived from
measurements of the fwhm of the mean and rms profiles show the closest
correspondence between the emission lines in a single object, even though the
emission line fwhm is a more biased mass indicator with respect to inclination.
The predicted large discrepancies in the SMBH mass estimates between emission
lines at low inclination, as derived using the line dispersion, we suggest may
be used as a means of identifying near face-on systems. Our general results do
not depend on specific choices in the simplifying assumptions, but are in fact
generic properties of BLR geometries with axial symmetry that span a
substantial range in radially-increasing scale height supported by turbulence,

presence of a single V_Si does not affect the half-metallic behavior of
pristine Z-SiCNRs; however, a single V_C leads to a transition from
half-metallic to metallic behavior in Z-SiCNRs due to the edge Si p orbitals
and the atoms surrounding the vacancy. The interactions of vacancies with
foreign impurity atoms (B and N) are also investigated and it is observed that
V_SiN_C does not only suppress the oscillatory type magnetism of V_SiV_C, but
also retains the half-metallic character of the pristine Z-SiCNRs. The defect
formation energies of vacancies can be reduced by substitutional B and N atoms.

gravity. Important aspects of the dynamics are understood, but many open
questions are pressing on. In this paper we address some of them using a
twistorial description, which brings new light on both classical and quantum
aspects of the theory. At the classical level, we clarify the covariant
properties of the discrete geometries involved, and the role of the simplicity
constraints in leading to SU(2) Ashtekar-Barbero variables. We identify areas
and Lorentzian dihedral angles in twistor space, and show that they form a
canonical pair. The primary simplicity constraints are solved by simple
twistors, parametrized by SU(2) spinors and the dihedral angles. We construct
an SU(2) holonomy and prove it to correspond to the (lattice version of the)
Ashtekar-Barbero connection. We argue that the role of secondary constraints is
to provide a non trivial embedding of the cotangent bundle of SU(2) in the
space of simple twistors. At the quantum level, a Schroedinger representation
leads to a spinorial version of simple projected spin networks, where the
argument of the wave functions is a spinor instead of a group element. We
rewrite the Liouville measure on the cotangent bundle of SL(2,C) as an integral
in twistor space. Using these tools, we show that the
Engle-Pereira-Rovelli-Livine transition amplitudes can be derived from a path
integral in twistor space. We construct a curvature tensor, show that it
carries torsion off-shell, and that its Riemann part is of Petrov type D.
Finally, we make contact between the semiclassical asymptotic behaviour of the
model and our construction, clarifying the relation of the Regge geometries

and b are the outcomes respectively for measurements alpha on one side, and
beta on the other, of an experiment involving two entangled particles traveling
in opposite directions from a source. The parameter lambda (the set of ""hidden

two particles. Because of lambda, the joint probability of detection is now
dependent only on lambda and the local measurement setting of alpha; similarly
for the other side and the setting beta. From this equation John Bell derived a
simple inequality that is violated by the predictions of quantum mechanics,
which is generally taken to imply that quantum mechanics is a nonlocal theory.
But, by combining Richard Feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics with a

(the ""space of all paths,"" SP) that (1) is immediately seen to replicate the

detectors on each side of the two-particle experiment. However, the set lambda
is nonmeasurable, and therefore the above equation is meaningless in SP.

threshold-based packet dropping policy that maximizes the weighted sum
throughput. Next, we consider utility maximization and develop a receiver-based
flow control scheme that, when combined with threshold-based packet dropping,
achieves the optimal utility. The flow control scheme creates virtual queues at
the receivers as a push-back mechanism to optimize the amount of data delivered
to the destinations via back-pressure routing. A novel feature of our scheme is
that a utility function can be assigned to a collection of flows, generalizing
the traditional approach of optimizing per-flow utilities. Our control policies
use finite-buffer queues and are independent of arrival statistics. Their
near-optimal performance is proved and further supported by simulation results.

discrete random variables. In this paper we obtain an entropy power inequality
for random variables taking values in an abelian group of order 2^n, i.e. for
such a group G we explicitly characterize the function f_G(x,y) giving the
minimum entropy of the sum of two independent G-valued random variables with
respective entropies x and y. Random variables achieving the extremum in this
inequality are thus the analogs of Gaussians in this case, and these are also

symmetry, convex in y for fixed x. This is a generalization to abelian groups

markedly enhanced, in concomitance with the reduction of spin degrees of
freedom previously seen in magnetic measurements as low dimensional precursors
of the spin-Peierls transition. The magneto-elastic coupling appears to be much
weaker in the hydrogenated salt due to the highly inhomogeneous elastic
behavior induced by the proximity of the charge ordering transition to the

ultrasound velocity is observed below the spin-Peierls transition temperature
$T_{\rm SP}$ in agreement with scaling of the elastic deformation with the

least 9/10, $\norm{SAx}_2 = (1 \pm \eps)\norm{Ax}_2$ simultaneously for all $x
\in \mathbb{R}^d$. Such a matrix $S$ is called a \emph{subspace embedding}.
Furthermore, $SA$ can be computed in $\nnz(A) + \poly(d \eps^{-1})$ time, where
$\nnz(A)$ is the number of non-zero entries of $A$. This improves over all
previous subspace embeddings, which required at least $\Omega(nd \log d)$ time
to achieve this property. We call our matrices $S$ \emph{sparse embedding
matrices}.
  Using our sparse embedding matrices, we obtain the fastest known algorithms
for $(1+\eps)$-approximation for overconstrained least-squares regression,
low-rank approximation, approximating all leverage scores, and
$\ell_p$-regression. The leading order term in the time complexity of our
algorithms is $O(\nnz(A))$ or $O(\nnz(A)\log n)$.
  We optimize the low-order $\poly(d/\eps)$ terms in our running times (or for
rank-$k$ approximation, the $n*\poly(k/eps)$ term), and show various tradeoffs.
For instance, we also use our methods to design new preconditioners that
improve the dependence on $\eps$ in least squares regression to $\log 1/\eps$.
Finally, we provide preliminary experimental results which suggest that our
algorithms are competitive in practice.

  V\'egh","On Mimicking Networks Representing Minimum Terminal Cuts",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a capacitated undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ with a set of terminals $K
\subset V$, a mimicking network is a smaller graph $H=(V_H,E_H)$ that exactly
preserves all the minimum cuts between the terminals. Specifically, the vertex
set of the sparsifier $V_H$ contains the set of terminals $K$ and for every
bipartition $U, K-U $ of the terminals $K$, the size of the minimum cut
separating $U$ from $K-U$ in $G$ is exactly equal to the size of the minimum
cut separating $U$ from $K-U$ in $H$.
  This notion of a mimicking network was introduced by Hagerup, Katajainen,
Nishimura and Ragde (1995) who also exhibited a mimicking network of size
$2^{2^{k}}$ for every graph with $k$ terminals. The best known lower bound on
the size of a mimicking network is linear in the number of terminals. More
precisely, the best known lower bound is $k+1$ for graphs with $k$ terminals
(Chaudhuri et al. 2000).
  In this work, we improve both the upper and lower bounds reducing the
doubly-exponential gap between them to a single-exponential gap. Specifically,
we obtain the following upper and lower bounds on mimicking networks: 1) Given
a graph $G$, we exhibit a construction of mimicking network with at most
$(|K|-1)$'th Dedekind number ($\approx 2^{{(k-1)} \choose {\lfloor {{(k-1)}/2}
\rfloor}}$) of vertices (independent of size of $V$). Furthermore, we show that
the construction is optimal among all {\it restricted mimicking networks} -- a
natural class of mimicking networks that are obtained by clustering vertices
together. 2) There exists graphs with $k$ terminals that have no mimicking
network of size smaller than $2^{\frac{k-1}{2}}$.
  We also exhibit improved constructions of mimicking networks for trees and
graphs of bounded tree-width.

this end, we first derive the zero-temperature phase diagram of the interacting

semi-metallic and a charge-density-wave ordered phase, the system exhibits a
quantum anomalous Hall phase, which is generated dynamically, i.e. purely as a
result of the repulsive fermionic interactions and in the absence of any
external gauge fields. We establish the topological nature of this dynamically
created Mott insulating phase by the numerical calculation of a Chern number.
Based on the knowledge of the mean-field phase diagram, we then discuss in
detail how the interacting Hamiltonian can be engineered effectively by
state-of-the-art experimental techniques for laser-dressing of cold fermionic
ground-state atoms with electronically excited Rydberg states that exhibit
strong dipolar interactions.

4,536,891 ratings provided by 171,670 users on 23,974$ movies, as well as the
household groupings of a subset of the users. The test dataset comprises 5,450
ratings for which the user label is missing, but the household label is
provided. The challenge required to identify the user labels for the ratings in
the test set. Our main finding is that temporal information (time labels of the
ratings) is significantly more useful for achieving this objective than the
user preferences (the actual ratings). Using a model that leverages on this
fact, we are able to identify users within a known household with an accuracy
of approximately 96% (i.e. misclassification rate around 4%).

through the solar corona and how can oscillations be used to diagnose the
plasma parameters and the magnetic field. In particular, we aim to analyse how
the temporal dependence of the loop length (here modelling the expansion) will
affect the P1 /P2 period ratio of transverse loop oscillations.
  Due to the uncertainty of the loop's shape through its expansion, we discuss
separately the case of the loop that maintains its initial semi-circular shape
and the case of the loop that from a semi-circular shape evolve into an
elliptical shape loop. The equations that describe the oscillations in
expanding flux tube are complicated due to the spatial and temporal dependence
of coefficients. Using the WKB approximation we find approximative values for
periods and their evolution, as well as the period ratio. For small values of
time (near the start of the expansion) we can employ a regular perturbation
method to find approximative relations for eigenfunctions and eigenfrequencies.
  Using simple analytical and numerical methods we show that the period of
oscillations are affected by the rising of the coronal loop. The change in the
period due to the increase in the loop's length is more pronounced for those
loops that expand into a more structured (or cooler corona). The deviation of
periods will have significant implications in determining the degree of
stratification in the solar corona. The effect of expansion on the periods of
oscillations is considerable only in the process of expansion of the loop but
not when it reached its final stage.

the NMSSM is obviously better than the MSSM. To explain the fine-tuning
problems such as gauge hiearchy problem and strong CP problem in the SM, we
point out that supersymmetry does not need to provide a dark matter candidate,
i.e., R-parity can be violated. Thus, we consider three kinds of the NMSSM
scenarios: in Scenarios I and II R-parity is conserved and the lightest
neutralino relic density is respectively around and smaller than the observed
value, while in Scenario III R-parity is violated. To fit all the experimental
data, we consider the \chi^2 analyses, and find that the Higgs boson mass and
decay rates can be explained very well in these Scenarios. Considering the
small \chi^2 values and fine-tuning around 2-3.7% (or 1-2%), we obtain the
viable parameter space with light (or relatively heavy) supersymmetric particle
spectra only in Scenario III (or in Scenarios I and II). Because the singlino,
Higgsinos, and light stop are relatively light in general, we can relax the LHC
supersymmetry search constraints but the XENON100 experiment gives a strong
constraint in Scenarios I and II. In all the viable parameter space, the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon (g_{\mu} - 2)/2 are generically small.
With R-parity violation, we can increase (g_{\mu} - 2)/2, and avoid the
contraints from the LHC supersymmetry searches and XENON100 experiment.
Therefore, Scenario III with R-parity violation is more natural and realistic
than Scenarios I and II.

resides in a diffuse intergalactic component usually referred to as the
Intra-Cluster Light (ICL). Theoretical models indicate that these intergalactic
stars originate mostly from the tidal interaction of the cluster galaxies
during the assembly history of the cluster, and that a significant fraction of
these stars could have formed in-situ from the late infall of cold metal-poor
gas clouds onto the cluster. The models make predictions about the age
distribution of the ICL stars, which may provide additional observational
constraints. However, these models also over-predict the fraction of stellar
mass in the ICL by a substantial margin. Here we present population synthesis
models for the ICL of a dumb-bell dominated intermediate redshift (z=0.29)
X-ray cluster for which we have deep MOS data obtained with the FORS2
instrument. In a previous paper we have proposed that the dumbell galaxy act as
a grinding machine tearing to pieces the galaxies that pass nearby thus
enriching the intergalactic medium. In this paper we analyze the spectra at
different locations within the ICL and find that it is dominated by old metal
rich stars, at odds with what has been found in nearby clusters where the stars
that dominate the ICL are old and metal poor. While we see a weak evidence of a
young, metal poor, component, if real, these young stars would amount to less
than 1% of the total ICL mass, much less than the up to 30% predicted by the
models. We propose that the very metal rich (i.e. 2.5 times solar) stars in the
ICL of our cluster, which comprise approximately 40% of the total mass,
originate mostly from the central dumb-bell galaxy, while the remaining solar
and metal poor stars come from spiral, post-starburst (E+A), and metal poor

consistent with the bulk of NGC 4365's stellar light, which `rolls' about the
photometric major axis. The blue and red GC subpopulations show `normal'
rotation about the minor axis. We also find that the red GC subpopulation is

suggesting a possible bias towards radial orbits relative to the other GC
subpopulations. Additionally, we find a population of low velocity GCs that

Three different simulations are performed with different mean Mach numbers (1,

of the same order as the ionized-gas pressure. The density structures initiated

ionization compression. When the curvature of the shell is sufficient, the
shell collapse on itself to form a pillar while a smaller curvature leads to
the formation of dense clumps that are accelerated with the shell and therefore
remain in the shell during the simulation. When the turbulent ram pressure of
the cold gas is sufficient to balance the ionized-gas pressure, some dense-gas
bubbles have enough kinetic energy to penetrate inside the ionized medium,
forming cometary globules. This suggests a direct relation in the observations
between the presence of globules and the relative importance of the turbulence
compared to the ionized-gas pressure. The probability density functions present
a double peak structure when the turbulence is low relative to the ionized-gas
pressure. This could be used in observations as an indication of the turbulence
inside molecular clouds.

black hole's gravitational tidal field exceeds the star's self gravity at
pericenter. Some of this stellar tidal debris can become gravitationally bound
to the black hole, leading to a bright electromagnetic flare with bolometric
luminosity proportional to the rate at which material falls back to pericenter.
In the Newtonian limit, this flare will have a light curve that scales as
t^-5/3 if the tidal debris has a flat distribution in binding energy. We
investigate the time dependence of the black-hole mass accretion rate when
tidal disruption occurs close enough the black hole that relativistic effects
are significant. We find that for orbits with pericenters comparable to the
radius of the marginally bound circular orbit, relativistic effects can double
the peak accretion rate and halve the time it takes to reach this peak
accretion rate. The accretion rate depends on both the magnitude of the
black-hole spin and its orientation with respect to the stellar orbit; for
orbits with a given pericenter radius in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, a maximal
black-hole spin anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum leads to the
largest peak accretion rate.

electrons are generated in hadronic cosmic ray (CR) proton interactions with
ambient thermal protons of the intra-cluster medium. Our CR model derives from
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation and additionally
accounts for CR transport in the form of CR streaming and diffusion. This opens
the possibility of changing the radio halo luminosity by more than an order of
magnitude on a dynamical time scale. We build a mock galaxy cluster catalog
from the large MultiDark N-body LCDM simulation by adopting a phenomenological
gas density model for each cluster based on X-ray measurements that matches
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) and X-ray scaling relations and luminosity function.
Using magnetic field strength estimates from Faraday rotation measure studies,
our model successfully reproduces the observed surface brightness profiles of
giant radio halos (Coma, A2163) as well as radio mini-halos (Perseus,
Ophiuchus), while obeying upper limits on the gamma-ray emission in these
clusters. Our model is also able to simultaneously reproduce the observed
bimodality of radio-loud and radio-quiet clusters at the same L_X as well as
the unimodal distribution of radio-halo luminosity versus the SZ flux Y;
thereby suggesting a physical solution to this apparent contradiction. For a
plausible fraction of 10% radio-loud clusters, our model matches the NVSS
radio-halo luminosity function. Constructing an analytical radio-halo
luminosity function, we demonstrate the unique prospects for low-frequency
radio surveys (such as the LOFAR Tier 1 survey) to detect ~3500 radio halos
back to redshift two and to probe the underlying physics of radio halos.

origin in the fact that the presence of a well defined hierarchy allows agents
to climb it, thus reinforcing it, whereas in a ""disordered"" society it is
harder for agents to find out whom they should connect to in order to become

transverse motions may be caused by reconnection between large scale fields

process that is know to generate high frequency kink mode MHD waves propagating
along the magnetic field lines.

calculations apply to BCS weak-coupling superconductors with isotropic gaps and
transport mean-free paths much less than the BCS coherence length. The kinetic
inductance is calculated for the response to a small alternating current when
the film is carrying a dc bias current. In the slow-experiment/fast-relaxation

transmitted. Such diseases are spatially transmitted via multiple species in
heterogeneous environments, typically described by complex meta-population
models. The reproduction number is a critical metric predicting whether the
disease can invade the meta-population system. This paper presents the
reproduction number for a generic disease vertically and horizontally
transmitted among multiple species in heterogeneous networks, where nodes are
locations, and links reflect outgoing or incoming movement flows. The
metapopulation model for vertically and horizontally transmitted diseases is
gradually formulated from two species, two-node network models. We derived an
explicit expression of the reproduction number, which is the spectral radius of
a matrix reduced in size with respect to the original next generation matrix.
The reproduction number is shown to be a function of vertical and horizontal
transmission parameters, and the lower bound is the reproduction number for
horizontal transmission. As an application, the reproduction number and its
bounds for the Rift Valley fever zoonosis, where livestock, mosquitoes, and
humans are the involved species are derived. By computing the reproduction
number for different scenarios through numerical simulations, we found the
reproduction number is affected by livestock movement rates only when
parameters are heterogeneous across nodes. To summarize, our study contributes
the reproduction number for vertically and horizontally transmitted diseases in
heterogeneous networks. This explicit expression is easily adaptable to
specific infectious diseases, affording insights into disease evolution.

Our main result concerns the Lubin-Tate tower, which plays a vital role in the

As an application, we find a family of open neighborhoods of this perfectoid
space whose special fibers are certain remarkable varieties over a finite field

sector. We derive the implied level of LIV required to suppress observation of
predicted fluxes from several mainstream cosmogenic neutrino models, and
specifically those recently constrained by the ANITA and RICE experiments. We
simulate via detailed Monte Carlo code the propagation of cosmogenic neutrino

observed simultaneous with electron distributions satisfying the whistler heat
flux instability threshold and most with T_{perp,h}/T_{para,h} > 1.01. Thus,
the whistler mode waves appear to be driven by a heat flux instability and
cause perpendicular heating of the halo electrons. The lower hybrid waves show
a much weaker correlation between \partialB and normalized heat flux magnitude
and are often observed near magnetic field gradients. A third type of event
shows fluctuations consistent with a mixture of both lower hybrid and whistler

is to develop a method for collecting data for which the least squares
estimator for the ranking problem has maximal Fisher information. Our approach,
based on experimental design, is to view data collection as a bi-level
optimization problem where the inner problem is the ranking problem and the
outer problem is to identify data which maximizes the informativeness of the

reducing to a problem of finding multigraphs with large algebraic connectivity.

be determined from the probability that the state is occupied. However, it is
often necessary to impose a biasing potential on the system so that high energy
states are sampled with sufficient frequency. The unbiased energy is typically
obtained from the data using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM).
Here we present differential energy surface analysis (DESA), in which the
gradient of the energy surface, dE/dx, is extracted from data taken with a
series of harmonic biasing potentials. It is shown that DESA produces a maximum
likelihood estimate of the folding landscape gradient. DESA is demonstrated by
analyzing data from a simulated system as well as data from a single-molecule
unfolding experiment in which the end-to-end distance of a DNA hairpin is
measured. It is shown that the energy surface obtained from DESA is
indistinguishable from the energy surface obtained when WHAM is applied to the
same data. Two criteria are defined which indicate whether the DESA results are
self-consistent. It is found that these criteria can detect a situation where
the energy is not a single-valued function of the measured reaction coordinate.
The criteria were found to be satisfied for the experimental data analyzed,
confirming that end-to-end distance is a good reaction coordinate for the
experimental system. The combination of DESA and the optical trap assay in
which a structure is disrupted under harmonic constraint facilitates an
extremely accurate measurement of the folding energy surface.

Theory",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the multiantenna broadcast channel without transmit-side
channel state information (CSIT). For this channel, it has been known that when
all receivers have channel state information (CSIR), the degrees of freedom
(DoF) cannot be improved beyond what is available via TDMA. The same is true if
none of the receivers possess CSIR. This paper shows that an entirely new
scenario emerges when receivers have unequal CSIR. In particular, orthogonal
transmission is no longer DoF-optimal when one receiver has CSIR and the other
does not. A multiplicative superposition is proposed for this scenario and
shown to attain the optimal degrees of freedom under a wide set of antenna
configurations and coherence lengths. Two signaling schemes are constructed
based on the multiplicative superposition. In the first method, the messages of
the two receivers are carried in the row and column spaces of a matrix,
respectively. This method works better than orthogonal transmission while
reception at each receiver is still interference free. The second method uses
coherent signaling for the receiver with CSIR, and Grassmannian signaling for
the receiver without CSIR. This second method requires interference
cancellation at the receiver with CSIR, but achieves higher DoF than the first
method.

heavy-heavy interatomic properties. This new universality is explained by the
universal properties of the van der Waals interactions in a simple

cannot provide deterministic service guarantees to a buyer. At the same time,
buyers are of different {\em types}, characterized by different communication
needs, tolerance for the channel uncertainty, and so on, all of which a buyer's
private information. The license holder must then try to design different
contracts catered to different types of buyers in order to maximize its profit.
We address this problem by adopting as a reference a traditional spectrum
market where the buyer can purchase exclusive access with fixed/deterministic
guarantees. We fully characterize the optimal solution in the cases where there
is a single buyer type, and when multiple types of buyers share the same, known
channel condition as a result of the primary user activity. In the most general

some four-term idempotents. However, Mockenhaupt conjectured that even the

work for all 2k < p < 2k+2 and for all k \in N. In two previous papers we

integral mean estimates in error bounds for a certain fourth order quadrature.

linear combinations of powers and powers of logarithms of absolute value

Pierce--Birkhoff conjecture. In the nineteen eighties J. Madden proved that the
Pierce-Birkhoff conjecture for a ring A$is equivalent to a statement about an
arbitrary pair of points $\alpha,\beta\in\sper\ A$ and their separating ideal
$<\alpha,\beta>$; we refer to this statement as the Local Pierce-Birkhoff
conjecture at $\alpha,\beta$. In this paper, for each pair $(\alpha,\beta)$
with $ht(<\alpha,\beta>)=\dim A$, we define a natural number, called complexity
of $(\alpha,\beta)$. Complexity 0 corresponds to the case when one of the
points $\alpha,\beta$ is monomial; this case was already settled in all
dimensions in a preceding paper. Here we introduce a new conjecture, called the
Strong Connectedness conjecture, and prove that the strong connectedness
conjecture in dimension n-1 implies the connectedness conjecture in dimension n
in the case when $ht(<\alpha,\beta>)$ is less than n-1. We prove the Strong
Connectedness conjecture in dimension 2, which gives the Connectedness and the
Pierce--Birkhoff conjectures in any dimension in the case when
$ht(<\alpha,\beta>)$ less than 2. Finally, we prove the Connectedness (and
hence also the Pierce--Birkhoff) conjecture in the case when dimension of A is
equal to $ht(<\alpha,\beta>)=3$, the pair $(\alpha,\beta)$ is of complexity 1
and $A$ is excellent with residue field the field of real numbers.

structural transitions, when increasing the external force. They are
characterized by a sudden increase of DNA contour length and a decrease of the
bending rigidity. It has been proposed that the first transition, at forces of
60--80 pN, is a transition from B to S-DNA, viewed as a stretched duplex DNA,
while the second one, at stronger forces, is a strand peeling resulting in
single stranded DNAs (ssDNA), similar to thermal denaturation. But due to
experimental conditions these two transitions can overlap, for instance for
poly(dA-dT). We derive analytical formula using a coupled discrete worm like
chain-Ising model. Our model takes into account bending rigidity, discreteness
of the chain, linear and non-linear (for ssDNA) bond stretching. In the limit
of zero force, this model simplifies into a coupled model already developed by
us for studying thermal DNA melting, establishing a connexion with previous
fitting parameter values for denaturation profiles. We find that: (i) ssDNA is
fitted, using an analytical formula, over a nanoNewton range with only three
free parameters, the contour length, the bending modulus and the monomer size;
(ii) a surprisingly good fit on this force range is possible only by choosing a
monomer size of 0.2 nm, almost 4 times smaller than the ssDNA nucleobase
length; (iii) mesoscopic models are not able to fit B to ssDNA (or S to ss)
transitions; (iv) an analytical formula for fitting B to S transitions is
derived in the strong force approximation and for long DNAs, which is in
excellent agreement with exact transfer matrix calculations; (v) this formula
fits perfectly well poly(dG-dC) and $\lambda$-DNA force-extension curves with
consistent parameter values; (vi) a coherent picture, where S to ssDNA
transitions are much more sensitive to base-pair sequence than the B to S one,
emerges.

we now consider a continuous fluid-structure system. Energy harvesting is

lies in a moderate fluid loading range, for which {the flexible structure} may
be destabilised by damping. The key goal of this work is to {analyse the effect

protoplanetary disks, during which a forming planetary system or
photoevaporation processes open a gap in the inner disk, drastically changing
the disk structure. From theoretical arguments it is expected that dust growth,
fragmentation and radial drift are strongly influenced by gas disk structure,
and pressure bumps in disks have been suggested as key features that may allow
grains to converge and grow efficiently.
  Aims. We want to study how the presence of a large planet in a disk
influences the growth and radial distribution of dust grains, and how
observable properties are linked to the mass of the planet.
  Methods. We combine two-dimensional hydrodynamical disk simulations of
disk-planet interactions with state-of-the-art coagulation/fragmentation models
to simulate the evolution of dust in a disk which has a gap created by a
massive planet. We compute images at different wavelengths and illustrate our
results using the example of the transition disk LkCa15.
  Results. The gap opened by a planet and the long-range interaction between
the planet and the outer disk create a single large pressure bump outside the
planetary orbit. Millimeter-sized particles form and accumulate at the pressure
maximum and naturally produce ring-shaped sub-millimeter emission that is
long-lived because radial drift no longer depletes the large grain population
of the disk. For large planet masses around 9 $M_{\mathrm{Jup}}$, the pressure
maximum and, therefore, the ring of millimeter particles is located at
distances that can be more than twice the star-planet separation, creating a
large spatial separation between the gas inner edge of the outer disk and the
peak millimeter emission. Smaller grains do get closer to the gap and we
predict how the surface brightness varies at different wavelengths.

focus on quasilinear scales where the minimum scale \lambda_{min} or
corresponding maximum wavenumber k_{max}= 2\pi/\lambda_{min} is targeted to be
between k_{max}={0.05-0.2} h/Mpc. For spectroscopic surveys, we find that we
can recover the full 3D clustering information when the redshift bin width
\Delta z used in the 2D tomography is similar to the targeted minimum scale,
i.e. \Delta z ~ {0.6-0.8} \lambda_{min} H(z)/c which corresponds to \Delta z ~
0.01-0.05 for z<1. This value of \Delta z is optimal in the sense that larger
values of \Delta z lose information, while smaller values violate our minimum
scale requirement. For a narrow-band photometric survey, with photo-z error
\sigma_z=0.004, we find almost identical results to the spectroscopic survey
because the photo-z error is smaller than the optimal bin width \sigma_z<\Delta
z. For a typical broad-band photometric survey with \sigma_z=0.1, we have that
\sigma_z>\Delta z and most radial information is intrinsically lost. The
remaining information can be recovered from the 2D tomography if we use \Delta
z ~ 2\sigma_z. While 3D and 2D analysis are shown here to be equivalent, the
advantage of using angular positions and redshifts is that we do not need a
fiducial cosmology to convert to 3D coordinates. This avoids assumptions and
marginalization over the fiducial model. In addition, it becomes straight
forward to combine RSD, clustering and weak lensing in 2D space.

dependent electric field ${\bf E}(t)$ in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic
field. A general and explicit factorization of the time evolution operator is
derived with each factor having a clear physical interpretation. The
factorization consists of a geometric operator (path-ordered magnetic
translation), a dynamical operator generated by the usual time-independent
Landau Hamiltonian, and a nonadiabatic operator that determines the transition
probabilities among the Landau levels. Since the path-ordered magnetic
translation and the nonadiabatic operators are, up to completely determined
numerical phase factors, just ordinary exponentials whose exponents are
explicitly expressible in terms of the canonical variables, all of the factors
in the factorization are explicitly constructed. The numerical phase factors
are quantum mechanical in nature and could be of significance in interference
experiments. The factorization is unique from the point of view of the quantum
adiabatic theorem and provides a demonstration of how the quantum adiabatic
theorem (incorporating the Berry phase phenomenon) is realized when infinitely
degenerate energy levels are involved. Since the factorization separates the
effect caused by the electric field into a geometric factor and a nonadiabatic
factor, it makes possible to calculate the nonadiabatic transition
probabilities near the adiabatic limit. A formula for matrix elements that
determines the mixing of the Landau levels for a general, non-adiabatic
evolution is also provided by the factorization.

case. We assume that the direction of the magnetic field changes with time in a
general way, so the Heisenberg equations of motion cannot be solved by
quadrature. Also, the potential is assumed to be of a general form. We use the
rotation operator associated with the solid angle Berry phase to transform the
problem to a rotating reference frame that follows the direction of the
magnetic field. In the rotating reference frame, we derive a natural
factorization of the time evolution operator by recognizing the crucial role
played by a gauge transformation. The major complexity of the problem arises
from the coupling between motion in the direction of the magnetic field and
motion perpendicular to the field. In the factorization, this complexity is
consolidated into a single operator that approaches the identity operator when
the potential confines the particle sufficiently close to a plane perpendicular
to the magnetic field. The structure of this operator is clarified by deriving
an expression for its generating Hamiltonian. The magnetic translation is the
most notable physical consequence in the adiabatic limit. This and the
non-adiabatic effects are studied as consequences of the general factorization.

the time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic equations to find temporal signatures of
large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves in the model atmosphere of open and expanding
magnetic field configuration, with a realistic temperature distribution. We
calculate the temporally and spatially averaged, instantaneous transversal
velocity of non-linear Alfv\'en waves at different heights of the model
atmosphere, and estimate its contribution to the unresolved non-thermal motions
caused by the waves. We find that the pulse-driven nonlinear Alfv\'en waves
with the amplitude $A_{\rm v}$=50 km s$^{-1}$ are the most likely candidates
for the non-thermal broadening of Si VIII $\lambda$1445.75 \AA\ line profiles
in the polar coronal hole as reported by Banerjee et al. (1998). We also
demonstrate that the Alfv\'en waves driven by comparatively smaller velocity
pulse with its amplitude $A_{\rm v}$=25 km s$^{-1}$ may contribute to the
spectral line width of the same line at various heights in coronal hole without
any significant broadening. The main conclusion of this paper is that
non-linear Alfv\'en waves excited impulsively in the lower solar atmosphere are
responsible for the observed spectral line broadening in polar coronal holes.
This is an important result as it allows us to conclude that such large
amplitude and pulse-driven Alfv\'en waves do indeed exist in solar coronal
holes. The existence of these waves and their undamped growth may impart the
required momentum to accelerate the solar wind.

Stamatellos et al. (2007), the column density is estimated using pre-computed
local quantities and is then used to estimate the radiative cooling rate. The
cooling rate is a quantity of considerable importance, for example, in
assessing the probability of disc fragmentation. Our method has three steps:
(i) the column density from the particle to the mid plane is estimated using
the vertical component of the gravitational acceleration, (ii) the ""total
surface density"" from the mid plane to the surface of the disc is calculated,
(iii) the column density from each particle to the surface is calculated from
the difference between (i) and (ii). This method is shown to greatly improve
the accuracy of column density estimates in disc geometry compared with the
method of Stamatellos. On the other hand, although the accuracy of our method
is still acceptable in the case of high density fragments formed within discs,
we find that the Stamatellos method performs better than our method in this
regime. Thus, a hybrid method (where the method is switched in regions of large
over-density) may be optimal.

clouds (IRDCs) were mapped at PACS 70, 100, and 160 micron and SPIRE 250, 350,
and 500 micron. In this paper, we characterize a population of cores which
appear in the PACS bands and place them into context with their host cloud and
investigate their evolutionary stage. We construct spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of 496 cores which appear in all PACS bands, 34% of which
lack counterparts at 24 micron. From single-temperature modified blackbody fits
of the SEDs, we derive the temperature, luminosity, and mass of each core.
These properties predominantly reflect the conditions in the cold, outer
regions. Taking into account optical depth effects and performing simple
radiative transfer models, we explore the origin of emission at PACS
wavelengths. The core population has a median temperature of 20K and has masses
and luminosities that span four to five orders of magnitude. Cores with a
counterpart at 24 micron are warmer and bluer on average than cores without a
24 micron counterpart. We conclude that cores bright at 24 micron are on
average more advanced in their evolution, where a central protostar(s) have
heated the outer bulk of the core, than 24 micron-dark cores. The 24 micron
emission itself can arise in instances where our line of sight aligns with an
exposed part of the warm inner core. About 10% of the total cloud mass is found
in a given cloud's core population. We uncover over 300 further candidate cores
which are dark until 100 micron. These are candidate starless objects, and
further observations will help us determine the nature of these very cold
cores.

reported for all E1, E2, M1, and M2 transitions among the lowest 49 levels.
Additionally, theoretical lifetimes are listed for all 49 levels. Collision
strengths are averaged over a Maxwellian velocity distribution and the
effective collision strengths obtained listed over a wide temperature range up
to 10**8.1 K. Comparisons are made with similar data obtained with the Flexible

show that upper bounds on the s-rank of the matrix multiplication tensor imply
upper bounds on the ordinary rank. In particular, if the ""s-rank exponent of
matrix multiplication"" equals 2, then omega = 2. This connection between the
s-rank exponent and the ordinary exponent enables us to significantly
generalize the group-theoretic approach of Cohn and Umans, from group algebras
to general algebras. Embedding matrix multiplication into general algebra
multiplication yields bounds on s-rank (not ordinary rank) and, prior to this
paper, that had been a barrier to working with general algebras.
  We identify adjacency algebras of coherent configurations as a promising
family of algebras in the generalized framework. Coherent configurations are
combinatorial objects that generalize groups and group actions; adjacency
algebras are the analogue of group algebras and retain many of their important
features. As with groups, coherent configurations support matrix multiplication
when a natural combinatorial condition is satisfied, involving triangles of
points in their underlying geometry.
  Finally, we prove a closure property involving symmetric powers of adjacency
algebras, which enables us to prove nontrivial bounds on omega using
commutative coherent configurations and suggests that commutative coherent
configurations may be sufficient to prove omega = 2. Altogether, our results
show that bounds on omega can be established by embedding large matrix
multiplication instances into small commutative coherent configurations, while
avoiding the representation-theoretic complications that were present in the
group-theoretic approach.

models the motion of a masless body under the influence of the Newtionan
gravitational force caused by two other bodies, the primaries, which move along
cicular planar Keplerian orbits. In a suitable system of coordinates, this
system has two degrees of freedom and the conserved energy is usually called
the Jacobi constant. In 1980, J. Llibre and C. Sim\'o proved the existence of
oscillatory motions for the restricted planar circular three body problem, that
is, of orbits which leave every bounded region but which return infinitely
often to some fixed bounded region. To prove their existence they had to assume
the ratio between the masses of the two primaries to be exponentially small
with respect to the Jacobi constant. In the present work, we generalize their
work proving the existence of oscillatory motions for any value of the mass
ratio.
  To obtain such motions, we show that, for any value of the mass ratio and for
big values of the Jacobi constant, there exist transversal intersections
between the stable and unstable manifolds of infinity which guarantee the
existence of a symbolic dynamics that creates the oscillatory orbits. The main
achievement is to rigorously prove the existence of these orbits without
assuming the mass ratio small since then this transversality can not be checked
by means of classical perturbation theory respect to the mass ratio. Since our
method is valid for all values of mass ratio, we are able to detect a curve in
the parameter space, formed by the mass ratio and the Jacobi constant, where
cubic homoclinic tangencies between the invariant manifolds of infinity appear.

require the use of new genuine NNLO four-parton antenna functions involving

establish continuity of j(r). Finally we describe a related exactly solvable

Universe. We use large, hydrodynamical simulations from the OWLS project to
investigate the effect of feedback from galaxy formation on the probability
distribution function and the power spectrum of the Lyman-alpha transmitted
flux. While metal-line cooling is unimportant, both galactic outflows from
massive galaxies driven by active galactic nuclei and winds from low-mass
galaxies driven by supernovae have a substantial impact on the flux statistics.
At redshift z=2.25, the effects on the flux statistics are of a similar
magnitude as the statistical uncertainties of published data sets. The changes
in the flux statistics are not due to differences in the temperature-density
relation of the photo-ionised gas. Instead, they are caused by changes in the
density distribution and in the fraction of hot, collisionally ionised gas. It
may be possible to disentangle astrophysical and cosmological effects by taking
advantage of the fact that they induce different redshift dependencies. In
particular, the magnitude of the feedback effects appears to decrease rapidly
with increasing redshift. Analyses of Lyman-alpha forest data from surveys that
are currently in process, such as BOSS/SDSS-III and X-Shooter/VLT, must take

C-Markov. This new definition fulfils one important expectation for a Markov
property: there exists a natural set-indexed generalization of the concept of
transition operator which leads to characterization and construction theorems
for C-Markov processes. Several other usual Markovian notions, including Feller
and strong Markov properties, can also be developed in this framework.
Actually, the C-Markov property turns out to be a natural extension of the
two-parameter \ast-Markov property to the multiparameter and as well the
set-indexed settings. Moreover, generalizing a classic result of the
real-parameter Markov theory, sample paths of multiparameter C-Feller processes

a signal was detected from about 200 to 430 Hz that had the proper dispersion
characteristics to be a whistler. The frequency-time dispersion of the whistler
was found to be 81 Hz1/2s. Based on this dispersion constant, we determined,
from a travel time computation, that the whistler must have originated from
lightning in the northern hemisphere of Saturn. Using a simple centrifugal
potential model consisting of water group ions, and hydrogen ions we also
determine the fractional concentration and scale height that gave the best fit
to the observed dispersion.

Fermi surface in optimally doped FeTe_{0.6}Se_{0.4} (T_c = 14.5 K), using
laser-excited angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). We observe
sharp superconducting coherence peaks at T = 2.5 K. In contrast to earlier
ARPES studies but consistent with thermodynamic results, the momentum
dependence shows a \cos(4\varphi) modulation of the SC-gap anisotropy. The
observed SC-gap anisotropy strongly indicates that the pairing interaction is
not a conventional phonon-mediated isotropic one. Instead, the results suggest
the importance of second-nearest-neighbor electronic interactions between the
iron sites in the framework of s_\pm-wave superconductivity.

the existence of globally optimal solutions to the commutativity properties of

together with the linear stability analysis of a two-dimensional steady base
flow are discussed. Spanwise boundary conditions are periodic and control
parameters set such that the shear layer is stable against Kelvin-Helmholtz
modes. Three branches of destabilising modes are found. The most destabilising
branch is associated with steady modes, over a finite range of spanwise
wavenumbers. The two other branches provide unsteady modes. Features of each
branches are recovered in the permanent regime: wavelength of the most powerful
spanwise Fourier mode, swaying phenomenon, angular frequencies, indicating that
modes of each branches are selected and interact in the permanent flow.

show that the Fermi surfaces (FS) of the non-superconducting crystal are in
good agreement with the rigid band shift model based on electron doping by
excess Fe while that of the superconducting crystal is in good agreement with
the calculated FS with no shift. From the FS comparison of both crystals, we
demonstrate the change of the cross-sectional area of the FS, suggesting that
the suppression of the FS nesting with the vector Q_{s} = (\pi, \pi) due to
excess Fe results in the disappearance of the superconductivity.

nanowire modulated by longitudinal periodic potential. The modulation potential
can be obtained from realistically grown supperlattices (SLs). Our study shows
that the Rashba spin-orbit interaction induces the level crossing point in the
parabolic nanowire SLs. We estimate large anticrossing width (approximately 117
$\mu eV$) between singlet-triplet states. We study the phonon and
electromagnetic field mediated spin transition rates in the parabolic nanowire
SLs. We report that the phonon mediated spin transition rate is several order
of magnitude larger than the electromagnetic field mediated spin transition
rate. Based on the Feynman disentangling technique, we find the exact spin
transition probability. For the case wave vector $k=0$, we report that the
transition probability can be tuned in the form of resonance at fixed time
interval. For the general case ($k\neq 0$), we solve the Riccati equation and
find that the arbitrary values of $k$ induces the damping in the transition
probability. At large value of Rashba spin-orbit coupling coefficients for
($k\neq 0$), spin transition probability freezes.

of the Micro Vertex Detector (MVD) of the PANDA experiment. The MVD will detect
charged particles as close as possible to the interaction zone. Design criteria
and the optimisation process as well as the technical solutions chosen are
discussed and the results of this process are subjected to extensive Monte
Carlo physics studies. The route towards realisation of the detector is
outlined.

line with non-Hermitian potential $V$ lie in the disjoint union of two disks in
the right and left half plane, respectively, provided that the $L^1-norm$ of
$V$ is bounded from above by the speed of light times the reduced Planck
constant. An analogous result for the Schr\""odinger operator, originally proved
by Abramov, Aslanyan and Davies, emerges in the nonrelativistic limit. For
massless Dirac operators, the condition on $V$ implies the absence of nonreal
eigenvalues. Our results are further generalized to potentials with slower
decay at infinity. As an application, we determine bounds on resonances and
embedded eigenvalues of Dirac operators with Hermitian dilation-analytic
potentials.

  for Pediatric Cardiology",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electronic health records contain rich textual data which possess critical
predictive information for machine-learning based diagnostic aids. However many
traditional machine learning methods fail to simultaneously integrate both
vector space data and text. We present a supervised method using Laplacian
eigenmaps to augment existing machine-learning methods with low-dimensional
representations of textual predictors which preserve the local similarities.
The proposed implementation performs alternating optimization using gradient
descent. For the evaluation we applied our method to over 2,000 patient records
from a large single-center pediatric cardiology practice to predict if patients
were diagnosed with cardiac disease. Our method was compared with latent
semantic indexing, latent Dirichlet allocation, and local Fisher discriminant
analysis. The results were assessed using AUC, MCC, specificity, and
sensitivity. Results indicate supervised Laplacian eigenmaps was the highest
performing method in our study, achieving 0.782 and 0.374 for AUC and MCC
respectively. SLE showed an increase in 8.16% in AUC and 20.6% in MCC over the
baseline which excluded textual data and a 2.69% and 5.35% increase in AUC and
MCC respectively over unsupervised Laplacian eigenmaps. This method allows many
existing machine learning predictors to effectively and efficiently utilize the
potential of textual predictors.

for comparison. Dependent on the coverage different morphologies are observed:
Superlattices of single adatoms in the 0.04 ML region, ordered adatom clusters
in the 0.1 ML region, elongated islands in the 0.3 ML region, and interwoven
stripes in the 0.5 ML region. In the region above the sequence is reversed with
occupied and empty positions complemented. Stronger short range interactions
increase the feature size of the clusters and reduce their lattice order. The
influence of the substrate elastic anisotropy turns out to be significant.

The relationship between this invariant and the level of the (quadratic) form
is investigated. The problem of determining the set of values of the weak
isotropy index of a form with respect to field extensions is addressed, with
both admissible and inadmissible integers being determined. The analogous
investigation with respect to the level of a form is also undertaken, with some

the NP-hard problem of scheduling jobs on N identical machines. The jobs are
independent and are allowed to be stopped and restarted on another machine at a
later time. They have well-defined deadlines, and relative priorities
quantified by non-negative real weights. The objective is to find schedules
which minimize the total weighted tardiness (TWT) of all jobs. We show how this
problem can be mapped into quadratic form and present a polynomial time
heuristic solution based on the Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) approach. It is
demonstrated, through the results of extensive numerical simulations, that this
solution outperforms other popular heuristic methods. The proposed heuristic is
both theoretically and empirically shown to be scalable to large problem sizes
(over 100 jobs to be scheduled), which makes it applicable to grid computing
scheduling, arising in fields such as computational biology, chemistry and
