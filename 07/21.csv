point in a given data cloud in R^d. Later, in measuring the depth of an
arbitrary point z with respect to the data, David Donoho and Miriam Gasko
considered hyperplanes through z and determined its 'depth' by the smallest
portion of data that are separated by such a hyperplane. Since then, these
ideas has proved extremely fruitful. A rich statistical methodology has
developed that is based on data depth and, more general, nonparametric depth
statistics. General notions of data depth have been introduced as well as many
special ones. These notions vary regarding their computability and robustness
and their sensitivity to reflect asymmetric shapes of the data. According to
their different properties they fit to particular applications. The upper level
sets of a depth statistic provide a family of set-valued statistics, named
depth-trimmed or central regions. They describe the distribution regarding its
location, scale and shape. The most central region serves as a median. The
notion of depth has been extended from data clouds, that is empirical
distributions, to general probability distributions on R^d, thus allowing for
laws of large numbers and consistency results. It has also been extended from
d-variate data to data in functional spaces.

the constraints, both inherent and practical, that set the usable upper limit

Doppler shifts, to keep the force resonant with the atoms as they are slowed.
In an initial experimental test of this chirped BCF method, helium atoms are
slowed by $\sim 370$ m/s using a BCF profile with a velocity width of $\lesssim
125$ m/s. Straightforward scaling of the present results indicates that a

thin and dense supernova shock wave may be capable of triggering the
self-gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core while simultaneously
injecting SLRIs. Axisymmetric hydrodynamics models have shown that this

fingers appear early in the 3D models, only a few RT fingers are likely to
impact the densest portion of the collapsing cloud core. These few RT fingers
must then be the source of any SLRI spatial heterogeneity in the solar nebula
inferred from isotopic analyses of chondritic meteorites. The models show that
SLRI injection efficiencies from a supernova several pc away fall at the lower

geodesic acceleration, we note that the small-residual approximation is
complemented by a small-curvature approximation. This latter approximation
provides a much broader justification for the Gauss-Newton approximate Hessian

progress, we explore here the benefits of performing the relevant computations
in a Geometric Algebra framework, which is particularly suited to describing
reflections. Starting from the Coxeter generators of the reflections, we
describe how the relevant chiral (rotational), full (Coxeter) and binary
polyhedral groups can be easily generated and treated in a unified way in a
versor formalism. In particular, this yields a simple construction of the
binary polyhedral groups as discrete spinor groups. These in turn are known to
generate Lie and Coxeter groups in dimension four, notably the exceptional
groups D_4, F_4 and H_4. A Clifford algebra approach thus reveals an unexpected
connection between Coxeter groups of ranks 3 and 4. We discuss how to extend
these considerations and computations to the Conformal Geometric Algebra setup,
in particular for the non-crystallographic groups, and construct root systems

belonging to Daubechies and Coiflet family in achieving image segmentation
through a fast statistical algorithm.The fact that wavelets belonging to
Daubechies family optimally capture the polynomial trends and those of Coiflet
family satisfy mini-max condition, makes this comparison interesting. In the
context of the present algorithm, it is found that the performance of Coiflet
wavelets is better, as compared to Daubechies wavelet.

Ahmad","Quantum Key Distribution based on Single Photon Bi-partite Correlation","12 pages, 5 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a scheme for key distribution based on bi-partite correlation of
single photons. Alice keeps an ancilla photon and sends a signal photon to Bob,
where intrinsic bi-partite correlation of these photons is obtained through
first order intensity correlation in their detectors. The key bits are
distributed through sharing four bi-partite correlation functions and photon
counting. The scheme consists of two parts; first, Alice prepares deterministic
photon states and Bob measures the photon states based on his random choice on
correlation functions. Second, Alice guesses Bob's choice of correlation
functions and sets the key bits by sending out photon states. Bob verifies the
key bits through the photon states regardless Alice made a right or wrong
guess. We called this key distribution scheme as prepare-measure-guess-verify
(PMGV) protocol. We discuss the protocol by using a highly attenuated laser
light, and then point out the advantages of using a fiber based correlated
photon-pair to achieve better performance in security, communication distance
and success rate of key distribution.

3-user $M \times N$ multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian interference
channel (GIC) in which each transmitter has $M$ antennas and each receiver has
$N$ antennas. A constraint of $2M \leq N$ is imposed so that random coding with
message-splitting achieves the optimal GDOF. Unlike symmetric case, two cross
channels to unintended receivers from each transmitter can have different
strengths, and hence, well known Han-Kobayashi common-private message splitting
would not achieve the optimal GDOF. Instead, splitting each user's message into
three parts is shown to achieve the optimal GDOF. The capacity of the
corresponding deterministic model is first established which provides
systematic way of determining side information for converse. Although this
deterministic model is philosophically similar to the one considered by Gou and
Jafar, additional constraints are imposed so that capacity description of the
deterministic model only contains the essential terms for establishing the GDOF
of Gaussian case. Based on this, the optimal GDOF of Gaussian case is
established with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ capacity approximation. The behavior of the
GDOF is interestingly different from that of the corresponding symmetric case.
Regarding the converse, several multiuser outer bounds which are suitable for
asymmetric case are derived by non-trivial generalization of the symmetric
case.

the boundary of the interval. As a first application, we show that there exists
a Kahler-Einstein metric on $P^2$ with cone singularity along a smooth conic
(degree 2) curve if and only if the angle is in $(\pi/2, 2\pi]$. When the angle
is $2\pi/3$ this proves the existence of a Sasaki-Einstein metric on the link
of a three dimensional $A_2$ singularity, and thus answers a problem posed by
Gauntlett-Martelli-Sparks-Yau. As a second application we prove a version of
Donaldson's conjecture about conical Kahler-Einstein metrics in the toric case
using Song-Wang's recent existence result of toric invariant conical
Kahler-Einstein metrics.

of Dependency sequents (D-sequents). Given a CNF formula F(X), a D-sequent is a
record stating that under a partial assignment a set of variables of X is
redundant in formula \exists{X}[F]. The D-sequent calculus is based on
operation join that forms a new D-sequent from two existing D-sequents. The new
algorithm solves the quantified version of SAT. That is, given a satisfiable
formula F, it, in general, does not produce an assignment satisfying F.
  The new algorithm is called DS-QSAT where DS stands for Dependency Sequent
and Q for Quantified.
  Importantly, a DPLL-like procedure is only a special case of DS-QSAT where a
very restricted kind of D-sequents is used. We argue that this restriction a)
adversely affects scalability of SAT-solvers and b) is caused by looking for an
explicit satisfying assignment rather than just proving satisfiability. We give
experimental results substantiating these claims.

based on matrix elements for \nu e e+ \mu- \bar{\nu}_{\mu}b\bar{b} production
and includes all non-resonant diagrams, interferences, and off-shell effects of
the top quarks. Such contributions are formally suppressed by the top-quark
width and turn out to be small in the inclusive cross section. However, they
can be strongly enhanced in exclusive observables that play an important role
in Higgs and new-physics searches. Also non-resonant and off-shell effects due
to the finite W-boson width are investigated in detail, but their impact is
much smaller than naively expected. We also introduce a matching approach to
improve NLO calculations involving intermediate unstable particles. Using a
fixed QCD scale leads to perturbative instabilities in the high-energy tails of
distributions, but an appropriate dynamical scale stabilises NLO predictions.
Numerical results for the total cross section, several distributions, and

Si3N4 system at 980 nm and g/2pi approx. 900 kHz in a Si system at 1550 nm. The
fact that large coupling strengths to GHz mechanical oscillators can be
achieved in SiN is important, as this material has a broad optical transparency
window, which allows operation throughout the visible and near-infrared. As an
application of this platform, we consider wide-band optical frequency
conversion between 1300 nm and 980 nm, using two optical nanobeam cavities
coupled on either side to the breathing mode of a mechanical nanobeam

dissipation and boundary driving, and derive its hydrodynamic description in
the large size limit. Both the average macroscopic behavior and the fluctuating
properties of the hydrodynamic fields are obtained from the microscopic
dynamics. This analysis yields a fluctuating balance equation for the local
energy density at the mesoscopic level, characterized by two terms: (i) a
diffusive term, with a current that fluctuates around its average behavior
given by nonlinear Fourier's law, and (ii) a dissipation term which is a
general function of the local energy density. The quasi-elasticity of
microscopic dynamics, required in order to have a nontrivial competition
between diffusion and dissipation in the macroscopic limit, implies a noiseless
dissipation term in the balance equation, so dissipation fluctuations are
enslaved to those of the density field. The microscopic complexity is thus
condensed in just three transport coefficients, the diffusivity, the mobility
and a new dissipation coefficient, which are explicitly calculated within a
local equilibrium approximation. Interestingly, the diffusivity and mobility
coefficients obey an Einstein relation despite the fully nonequilibrium
character of the problem. The general theory here presented is applied to a
particular albeit broad family of systems, the simplest nonlinear dissipative
variant of the so-called KMP model for heat transport. The theoretical
predictions are compared to extensive numerical simulations, and an excellent
agreement is found.

exponential decline of the X-ray flux was followed with Swift observations, all
of which revealed spectra with low temperatures (~100eV) indicating that MAXI
J0158-744 is a new Supersoft Source (SSS). The Swift X-ray spectra near maximum
show features around 0.8 keV that we interpret as possible absorption from
OVIII, and emission from O, Fe, and Ne lines. We obtained SAAO and ESO optical
spectra of the counterpart early in the outburst and several weeks later. The
early spectrum is dominated by strong Balmer and HeI emission, together with
weaker HeII emission. The later spectrum reveals absorption features that
indicate a B1/2IIIe spectral type, and all spectral features are at velocities
consistent with the Small Magellanic Cloud. At this distance, it is a luminous
SSS (>10^37 erg/s) but whose brief peak luminosity of >10^39 erg/s in the 2-4
keV band makes it the brightest SSS yet seen at ""hard"" X-rays. We propose that
MAXI J0158-744 is a Be-WD binary, and the first example to possibly enter ULX
territory. The brief hard X-ray flash could possibly be a result of the
interaction of the ejected nova shell with the B star wind in which the white
dwarf (WD) is embedded. This makes MAXI J0158-744 only the third Be/WD system
in the Magellanic Clouds, but it is by far the most luminous. The properties of
MAXI J0158-744 give weight to previous suggestions that SSS in nearby galaxies
are associated with early-type stellar systems.

  Yule trees",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The branching structure of biological evolution confers statistical
dependencies on phenotypic trait values in related organisms. For this reason,
comparative macroevolutionary studies usually begin with an inferred phylogeny
that describes the evolutionary relationships of the organisms of interest. The
probability of the observed trait data can be computed by assuming a model for
trait evolution, such as Brownian motion, over the branches of this fixed tree.
However, the phylogenetic tree itself contributes statistical uncertainty to
estimates of other evolutionary quantities, and many comparative evolutionary
biologists regard the tree as a nuisance parameter. In this paper, we present a
framework for analytically integrating over unknown phylogenetic trees in
comparative evolutionary studies by assuming that the tree arises from a
continuous-time Markov branching model called the Yule process. To do this, we
derive a closed-form expression for the distribution of phylogenetic diversity,
which is the sum of branch lengths connecting a set of taxa. We then present a
generalization of phylogenetic diversity which is equivalent to the expected
trait disparity in a set of taxa whose evolutionary relationships are generated
by a Yule process and whose traits evolve by Brownian motion. We derive
expressions for the distribution of expected trait disparity under a Yule tree.
Given one or more observations of trait disparity in a clade, we perform fast
likelihood-based estimation of the Brownian variance for unresolved clades. Our
method does not require simulation or a fixed phylogenetic tree. We conclude
with a brief example illustrating Brownian rate estimation for thirteen
families in the Mammalian order Carnivora, in which the phylogenetic tree for
each family is unresolved.

polarization power spectra using the 95-GHz data. This data set comprises 5337
hours of observations recorded by an array of 84 polarized coherent receivers
with a total array sensitivity of 87 uK sqrt(s). Four low-foreground fields
were observed, covering a total of ~1000 square degrees with an effective
angular resolution of 12.8', allowing for constraints on primordial
gravitational waves and high-signal-to-noise measurements of the E-modes across
three acoustic peaks. The data reduction was performed using two independent
analysis pipelines, one based on a pseudo-Cl (PCL) cross-correlation approach,
and the other on a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach. All data selection
criteria and filters were modified until a predefined set of null tests had
been satisfied before inspecting any non-null power spectrum. The results
derived by the two pipelines are in good agreement. We characterize the EE, EB
and BB power spectra between l=25 and 975 and find that the EE spectrum is
consistent with LCDM, while the BB power spectrum is consistent with zero.
Based on these measurements, we constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio to
r=1.1+0.9-0.8 (r<2.8 at 95% C.L.) as derived by the ML pipeline, and
r=1.2+0.9-0.8 (r<2.7 at 95% C.L.) as derived by the PCL pipeline. In one of the
fields, we find a correlation with the dust component of the Planck Sky Model,
though the corresponding excess power is small compared to statistical errors.
Finally, we derive limits on all known systematic errors, and demonstrate that
these correspond to a tensor-to-scalar ratio smaller than r=0.01, the lowest
level yet reported in the literature.

  Messages","Two-Column Version, Introduction Revised",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a brain inspired wireless communication scheme, cognitive radio is a novel
approach to promote the efficient use of the scarce radio spectrum by allowing
some users called cognitive users to access the under-utilized spectrum
licensed out to the primary users. Besides highly reliable communication and
efficient utilization of the radio spectrum, the security of information
transmission against eavesdropping is critical in the cognitive radios for many
potential applications. In this paper, this problem is investigated from an
information theoretic viewpoint. Capacity limits are explored for the Cognitive
Radio Channel (CRC) with confidential messages. As an idealized information
theoretic model for the cognitive radio, this channel includes two transmitters
which send independent messages to their corresponding receivers such that one
transmitter, i.e., the cognitive transmitter, has access non-causally to the
message of the other transmitter, i.e., the primary transmitter. The message
designated to each receiver is required to be kept confidential with respect to
the other receiver. The secrecy level for each message is evaluated using the
equivocation rate. Novel inner and outer bounds for the capacity-equivocation
region are established. It is shown that these bounds coincide for some special
cases. Specifically, the capacity-equivocation region is derived for a class of
less-noisy CRCs and also a class of semi-deterministic CRCs. For the case where
only the message of the cognitive transmitter is required to be kept
confidential, the capacity-equivocation region is also established for the
Gaussian CRC with weak interference.

construct high signal-to-noise (S/N) profiles. We call these high S/N profiles
super profiles. We analyze and discuss possible systematics that may change the
observed shapes of the super profiles. After quantifying these effects and
selecting a sub-sample of unaffected galaxies, we find that the super profiles
are best described by a narrow and a broad Gaussian component, which are
evidence of the presence of the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM) and the Warm Neutral
Medium (WNM). The velocity dispersion of the narrow component range from ~3.4
to ~8.6 km/s with an average of 6.5+/-1.5 km/s, whereas that of the broad
component range from ~10.1 to ~24.3 km/s with an average of 16.8+/-4.3 km/s. We
find that the super profile parameters correlate with star formation indicators
such as metallicity, FUV-NUV colors and H_alpha luminosities. The flux ratio
between the narrow and broad components tends to be highest for high
metallicity, high star formation rate (SFR) galaxies. We show that the narrow
component identified in the super profiles is associated with the presence of
star formation, and possibly with molecular hydrogen.

aim is to predict colour magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for huge numbers of stars.
With this method we generate synthetic CMDs for N-body simulations of galaxies.
Sophisticated hydrodynamic N-body models of galaxies require equal quality
simulations of the photometric properties of their stellar content. The only
prerequisite for the method to work is very little information on the star
formation and chemical enrichment histories, i.e. the age and metallicity of
all star-particles as a function of time. The method takes into account the gap
between the mass of real stars and that of the star-particles in N-body
simulations, which best correspond to the mass of star clusters with different
age and metallicity, i.e. a manifold of single stellar sopulations (SSP).
Methods. The theory extends the concept of SSP to include the phase-space
(position and velocity) of each star. Furthermore, it accelerates the building
up of simulated CMD by using a database of theoretical SSPs that extends to all
ages and metallicities of interest. Finally, it uses the concept of
distribution functions to build up the CMD. The technique is independent of the
mass resolution and the way the N-body simulation has been calculated. This
allows us to generate CMDs for simulated stellar systems of any kind: from open
clusters to globular clusters, dwarf galaxies, or spiral and elliptical
galaxies. Results. The new theory is applied to an N-body simulation of a disc
galaxy to test its performance and highlight its flexibility.

5 bands between 100-500 {\mu}m from the HeViCS survey, and with HI data from
the VIVA survey, to obtain spatially resolved dust and gas distributions. We
studied the environmental dependencies by adding to our sample eight galaxies
with 12CO(1-0) maps from the literature. We estimate the integrated mass of
molecular hydrogen for the galaxies observed in the CO lines. We find
molecular-to-total gas mass fractions between 0.04 \leq fmol \leq 0.65, with
the lowest values for the dimmest galaxy in the B-band. The integrated
dust-to-gas ratio ranges between 0.011 and 0.004. For the 12 mapped galaxies we
derive the radial distributions of the atomic gas, molecular gas, and dust. We
also study the effect of different CO-to-H2 conversion factors. Both the
molecular gas and the dust distributions show steeper radial profiles for
HI-deficient galaxies and the average dust-to-gas ratio for these galaxies
increases or stays radially constant. On scales of \sim 3 kpc, we find a strong
correlation between the molecular gas and the 250 micron surface brightness
that is tighter than average for non-deficient galaxies. The correlation
becomes linear if we consider the total gas surface mass density. However, the
inclusion of atomic hydrogen does not improve the statistical significance of
the correlation. The environment can modify the distributions of molecules and
dust within a galaxy, although these components are more tightly bound than the
atomic gas.

etendue and spectral resolving power for seeing-limited, integral field
observations in the 0.9-1.8 um range and is most sensitive in the 0.9-1.35 um
range. Its optical design consists of front-end re-imaging optics, an
all-reflective image slicer-type, integral field unit (IFU) called FISICA, and
a long-slit grating spectrograph back-end that is coupled with a HAWAII 2RG
focal plane array. The full wavelength range is achieved by selecting between
two different gratings. By virtue of its re-imaging optics, the spectrograph is
quite versatile and can be used at multiple telescopes. The size of its
field-of-view is unrivalled by other similar spectrographs, offering a 4.5"" x
12"" integral field at a 10-meter class telescope (or 20"" x 50"" at a 2.3-meter
telescope). The use of WIFIS will be crucial in astronomical problems which
require wide-field, two-dimensional spectroscopy such as the study of merging
galaxies at moderate redshift and nearby star/planet-forming regions and
supernova remnants. We discuss the final optical design of WIFIS, and its
predicted on-sky performance on two reference telescope platforms: the 2.3-m
Steward Bok telescope and the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. We also present
the results from our laboratory characterization of FISICA. IFU properties such
as magnification, field-mapping, and slit width along the entire slit length
were measured by our tests. The construction and testing of WIFIS is expected
to be completed by early 2013. We plan to commission the instrument at the

thermoelectric power S(T) measurements. Furthermore 11B NMR study was performed
to probe the magnetism on a microscopic scale. The chi(T), C(T) and rho(T) data
confirm bulk ferromagnetic ordering with Tc = 5.1 K. Ce ions in CeIr2B2 are in
stable trivalent state. Our low-temperature C(T) data measured down to 0.4 K
yield Sommerfeld coefficient gamma = 73(4) mJ/molK2 which is much smaller than
the previously reported value of gamma = 180 mJ/molK2 deduced from the specific
heat measurement down to 2.5 K. For LaIr2B2 gamma = 6(1) mJ/molK2 which implies
the density of states at the Fermi level D(EF) = 2.54 states/(eV f.u.) for both
spin directions. The renormalization factor for quasi-particle density of
states and hence for quasi-particle mass due to 4f correlations in CeIr2B2 is
12. The Kondo temperature TK ~ 4 K is estimated from the jump in specific heat
of CeIr2B2 at Tc. Both C(T) and rho(T) data exhibit gapped-magnon behavior in
magnetically ordered state with an energy gap Eg ~ 3.5 K. The rho data as a
function of magnetic field H indicate a large negative magnetoresistance (MR)
which is highest for T = 5 K.While at 5 K the negative MR keeps on increasing
up to 10 T, at 2 K an upturn is observed near H = 3.5 T. On the other hand, the
thermoelectric power data have small absolute values (S ~ 7 {\mu}V/K)
indicating a weak Kondo interaction. A shoulder in S(T) at about 30 K followed
by a minimum at ~ 10 K is attributed to crystal electric field (CEF) effects
and the onset of magnetic ordering. 11B NMR line broadening provides strong
evidence of ferromagnetic correlations below 40 K.

worst-case scenario for the multi-user MIMO system, where the transmitter
assumes users cooperate to eavesdrop on other users. We derive the achievable
secrecy sum-rate and obtain the closed-form expression for the optimal

large-system analysis. We show that the RCI precoder with
$\alpha_{\mathrm{LS}}$ outperforms several other linear precoding schemes, and
it achieves a secrecy sum-rate that has same scaling factor as the sum-rate
achieved by the optimum RCI precoder without secrecy requirements. We propose a
power allocation algorithm to maximize the secrecy sum-rate for fixed $\alpha$.
We then extend our algorithm to maximize the secrecy sum-rate by jointly
optimizing $\alpha$ and the power allocation vector. The jointly optimized

by up to 20 percent at practical values of the signal-to-noise ratio and for 4

delay-robust, namely logically equivalent to their delay-free counterparts. For
this we introduce inter-agent channels modeled as 2-state automata, compute the

delay-robustness. From the test it typically results that the given delay-free
distributed control is delay-robust with respect to certain communicated

the X-ray free electron laser (X-FEL) at the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source
(LCLS) we now have such a source available in the keV regime. One challenge
with X-ray Thomson scattering experiments is understanding how to model the
scattering for partially ionized plasmas. Most Thomson scattering codes used to
model experimental data greatly simplify or neglect the contributions of the
bound electrons to the scattered intensity. In this work we take the existing
models of Thomson scattering that include elastic ion-ion scattering and the
electron-electron plasmon scattering and add the contribution of the bound
electrons in the partially ionized plasmas. Except for hydrogen plasmas almost
every plasma that is studied today has bound electrons and it is important to
understand their contribution to the Thomson scattering, especially as new
X-ray sources such as the X-FEL will allow us to study much higher Z plasmas.
Currently most experiments have looked at hydrogen or beryllium. We will first
look at the bound electron contributions to beryllium by analysing existing
experimental data. We then consider several higher Z materials such as Cr and
predict the existence of additional peaks in the scattering spectrum that
requires new computational tools to understand. For a Sn plasma we show that
the bound contributions changes the shape of the scattered spectrum in a way
that would change the plasma temperature and density inferred by the
experiment.

theoretical probability distributions which can be used to approximate
observational patterns of focal mechanisms. Uniform random rotation
distributions for various DC sources are discussed, as well as two non-uniform
distributions: the rotational Cauchy and von Mises-Fisher. We discuss how
parameters of these rotations can be estimated by a statistical analysis of
earthquake source properties in global seismicity. We also show how earthquake
focal mechanism orientations can be displayed on the Rodrigues vector space.

quantum field theory, magnetic catalysis is broadly defined as an enhancement
of dynamical symmetry breaking by an external magnetic field. We start from a
brief discussion of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the role of a magnetic
field in its a dynamics. This is followed by a detailed presentation of the
essential features of the phenomenon. In particular, we emphasize that the
dimensional reduction plays a profound role in the pairing dynamics in a
magnetic field. Using the general nature of underlying physics and its
robustness with respect to interaction types and model content, we argue that
magnetic catalysis is a universal and model-independent phenomenon. In support
of this claim, we show how magnetic catalysis is realized in various models
with short-range and long-range interactions. We argue that the general nature
of the phenomenon implies a wide range of potential applications: from certain
types of solid state systems to models in cosmology, particle and nuclear
physics. We finish the review with general remarks about magnetic catalysis and
an outlook for future research.

internal structures have been generated through microfluidics. To study effects
of layers, inner droplets and asymmetry of internal structures on rheology of
multiple emulsions, a generalized boundary integral method is developed to
investigate multiple emulsions with orderly structures up to n layers and up to
mi droplets in the i-th layer. Under a modest extensional flow, the
complication of internal structures and the collision among inner droplets will
subject the particle to stronger shears. However, the particle will ease the
added tension through the simplification of internal structures
(destabilization) such as coalescence or release of inner droplets. Since the
rheology of multiple emulsions is sensitive to internal structures and their
change, modelling them as the core-shell droplets to obtain viscosity equation
should be modified by introducing the variable ""time"". Asymmetric internal
structures will induce oriented contact and merging of the outer and inner
interface. The start time of the interface merging can be controlled by
adjusting the viscosity ratio and enhancing the asymmetry, which is promising
in the controlled release of inner droplets for targeted drug delivery.

(CO2) to liquid fuels and commodity chemicals, in part because of its high

activation on CeO2 surfaces remain largely unknown. We use density functional
theory, corrected for onsite Coulombic interactions (DFT+U), to explore various
adsorption sites and configurations for CO2 on stoichiometric and reduced CeO2
(110). Our model of reduced CeO2 (110) contains oxygen vacancies at the topmost
atomic layer and undergoes surface reconstruction upon introduction of these
vacancies. We find that CO2 adsorption on reduced CeO2 (110) is
thermodynamically favored over the corresponding adsorption on stoichiometric
CeO2 (110). The most stable adsorption configuration consists of CO2 adsorbed
parallel to the reduced CeO2 (110) surface, with the molecule situated near the
site of the oxygen vacancy. Structural changes in the CO2 molecule are also
observed upon adsorption, so that the resulting O-C-O angle is 136.9 degrees
and the C-O bonds are 1.198 Angstroms and 1.311 Angstroms in length,
respectively. The molecule bends out of plane to form a unidentate carbonate,
as opposed to the bidentate carbonate found by other researchers for CO
adsorption to stoichiometric CeO2. We deduce that charge transfer from reduced
surface Ce3+ ions to the adsorbate to form the carbonate anion is the first
step in the activation and reduction process and cleavage of the C-O bond.

  (2) If $K$ is a non-CM field of unit rank 2 or higher, then the computational

experiments such as that of Aspect, Dalibard and Roger [Phys. Rev. Lett. 49
(1982) 1804-1807] provides empirical proof of nonlocality in the real world.
This paper reviews recent work on Bell's theorem, linking it to issues in
causality as understood by statisticians. The paper starts with a proof of a
strong, finite sample, version of Bell's inequality and thereby also of Bell's
theorem, which states that quantum theory is incompatible with the conjunction
of three formerly uncontroversial physical principles, here referred to as
locality, realism and freedom. Locality is the principle that the direction of
causality matches the direction of time, and that causal influences need time
to propagate spatially. Realism and freedom are directly connected to
statistical thinking on causality: they relate to counterfactual reasoning, and
to randomisation, respectively. Experimental loopholes in state-of-the-art Bell
type experiments are related to statistical issues of post-selection in
observational studies, and the missing at random assumption. They can be
avoided by properly matching the statistical analysis to the actual
experimental design, instead of by making untestable assumptions of
independence between observed and unobserved variables. Methodological and
statistical issues in the design of quantum Randi challenges (QRC) are
discussed. The paper argues that Bell's theorem (and its experimental
confirmation) should lead us to relinquish not locality, but realism.

found that V648 Car shows large U-band variability over time scales of minutes.
To our knowledge, it is amongst the largest flickering of a symbiotic star ever
reported. Our finding supports the hypothesis that symbiotic WDs producing hard
X-rays are predominantly powered by accretion, rather than quasi-steady nuclear
burning, and have masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit. No significant
periodicity is evident from the flickering light curve. The ASAS long-term V
light curve suggests the presence of a tidally distorted giant accreting via
Roche Lobe overflow, and a binary period of about 520 days. On the basis of the
outstanding physical properties of V648 Car as hinted by its fast and long-term
optical variability, as well as by its nature as hard X-ray emitter, we
therefore call for simultaneous follow-up observations in different bands,
ideally combined with time-resolved optical spectroscopy.

to reducing the error of segmentation. As a by-product, our method produces a
dictionary of optimized orthonormal descriptors for each segmented region. The
unique feature of our method is that it achieves the simultaneous segmentation
and description for non-smooth image structures under the same optimization
framework. The experiments validate our theoretical claims and show the clear
superior performance of our methods over other related methods for segmentation

is governed by 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, while the
elastodynamics of the cylindrical wall is modeled by the 1D cylindrical Koiter

  The proof is based on a novel semi-discrete, operator splitting numerical

Series Models with Independent Noise (TiMINo). These models require independent
residual time series, whereas traditional methods like Granger causality
exploit the variance of residuals. There are two main contributions: (1)
Theoretical: By restricting the model class (e.g. to additive noise) we can
provide a more general identifiability result than existing ones. This result
incorporates lagged and instantaneous effects that can be nonlinear and do not
need to be faithful, and non-instantaneous feedbacks between the time series.
(2) Practical: If there are no feedback loops between time series, we propose
an algorithm based on non-linear independence tests of time series. When the
data are causally insufficient, or the data generating process does not satisfy
the model assumptions, this algorithm may still give partial results, but
mostly avoids incorrect answers. An extension to (non-instantaneous) feedbacks
is possible, but not discussed. It outperforms existing methods on artificial

single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to assist the development of new DNA-based
biosensors. A ssDNA model containing twelve bases was constructed from the
130-145 codon sequence of the p53 gene. Various thermodynamic macroscopic
observables such as temperature, energy distributions, as well as root mean
square deviation (RMSD) of the nucleic acid backbone of the ssDNA were studied
using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The AMBER program was used for
building the structural model of the ssDNA, and atomistic MD simulations in
three different ensembles were carried out using the NAMD program. The
microcanonical (NVE), conical (NVT) and isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensembles
were employed to compare the equilibrium characteristics of ssDNA in aqueous
solutions. Our results indicate that the conformational stability of the ssDNA
is dependent on the thermodynamic conditions.

to choose a set of elements that maximizes the total value of the set, subject
to being an independent set of a matroid given in advance. The difficulty comes
from the assumption that decisions are irrevocable: if we choose to accept an
element when it is presented by the stream then we can never get rid of it, and
if we choose not to accept it then we cannot later add it. Babaioff, Immorlica,
and Kleinberg [SODA 2007] introduced this problem, gave O(1)-competitive
algorithms for certain classes of matroids, and conjectured that every matroid
admits an O(1)-competitive algorithm. However, most matroids that are known to
admit an O(1)-competitive algorithm can be easily represented using graphs
(e.g. graphic and transversal matroids). In particular, there is very little
known about F-representable matroids (the class of matroids that can be
represented as elements of a vector space over a field F), which are one of the
foundational matroid classes. Moreover, most of the known techniques are as
dependent on graph theory as they are on matroid theory. We go beyond graphs by
giving an O(1)-competitive algorithm for regular matroids (the class of
matroids that are representable over every field), and use techniques that are
matroid-theoretic rather than graph-theoretic. We use the regular matroid
decomposition theorem of Seymour to decompose any regular matroid into matroids
which are either graphic, cographic, or isomorphic to R_{10}, and then show how
to combine algorithms for these basic classes into an algorithm for regular
matroids. This allows us to generalize beyond regular matroids to any class of
matroids that admits such a decomposition into classes for which we already
have good algorithms. In particular, we give an O(1)-competitive algorithm for
the class of max-flow min-cut matroids.

equation of motion of a point charge in six dimensions?
  This book provides a self-contained and systematic introduction to problems
of radiation and radiation reaction in classical field theory. Besides
conventional electrodynamics in four dimensions (one time dimension and three
spatial ones), we consider exotic worlds of dimensions other than four which
arise in various research areas, e. g. in string theory, physics of graphene,
dynamics of superfluid 4He film etc. Thorough analysis is given to radiation
phenomena and charges' equations of motions where the radiation reaction is
taken into account. The intended audience is physicist who works in relative
fields or graduate student who wants a short exposition of classical
electrodynamics in the language of coordinate-free differential geometry.

of a star in which the fluid component is interacting with a growing vacuum
energy density. The influence of the variable vacuum in the collapsing core is
quantified by a phenomenological \beta-parameter as predicted by dimensional
arguments and the renormalization group approach. For all reasonable values of
this free parameter, we find that the vacuum energy density increases the
collapsing time but it cannot prevent the formation of a singular point.
However, the nature of the singularity depends on the values of \beta. In the
radiation case, a trapped surface is formed for \beta<1/2 whereas for
\beta>1/2, a naked singularity is developed. In general, the critical value is
\beta=1-2/3(1+\omega), where the \omega-parameter describes the equation of
state of the fluid component.

galaxies observed at intermediate to high redshift agree with expectations for
the properties of galaxies that formed metal-poor halo globular clusters (GCs).
The low metallicity of these clusters is the result of their formation in
low-mass galaxies. Metal-poor GCs could enter spiral galaxies along with their
dwarf galaxy hosts, unlike metal-rich GCs which form in the spirals themselves.
Considering an initial GC mass larger than the current mass to account for
multiple stellar populations, and considering the additional clusters that are
likely to form with massive clusters, we estimate that each GC with a mass
today greater than 2x10^5 Msun was likely to have formed among a total stellar
mass ~3x10^7 Msun, a molecular mass ~10^9 Msun, and 10^7 to 10^9 Msun of older
stars, depending on the relative gas fraction. The star formation rate would
have been several Msun/yr lasting for ~10^7 yrs, and the Lyman-alpha luminosity
would have been ~10^42 erg/s. Integrating the LAE galaxy luminosity function
above this minimum, considering the average escape probability for Lyalpha
photons (25%), and then dividing by the probability that a dwarf galaxy is
observed in the LAE phase (0.4%), we find agreement between the co-moving space
density of LAEs and the average space density of metal-poor globular clusters
today. The local galaxy WLM, with its early starburst and old GC, could be an
LAE remnant that did not get into a galaxy halo because of its remote location.

the sequence of colors along the path does not contain two identical,
consecutive blocks. The remarkable construction of Thue asserts that 3 colors
are enough to color nonrepetitively paths of any length. A nonrepetitive
coloring of a graph is a coloring of its vertices such that all simple paths
are nonrepetitively colored. Assume that each vertex $v$ of a graph $G$ has
assigned a set (list) of colors $L_v$. A coloring is chosen from $\{L_v\}_{v\in
V(G)}$ if the color of each $v$ belongs to $L_v$. The Thue choice number of
$G$, denoted by $\pi_l(G)$, is the minimum $k$ such that for any list
assignment $\set{L_v}$ of $G$ with each $|L_v|\geq k$ there is a nonrepetitive
coloring of $G$ chosen from $\{L_v\}$. Alon et al. (2002) proved that
$\pi_l(G)=O(\Delta^2)$ for every graph $G$ with maximum degree at most
$\Delta$. We propose an almost linear bound in $\Delta$ for trees, namely for
any $\epsi>0$ there is a constant $c$ such that $\pi_l(T)\leq
c\Delta^{1+\epsi}$ for every tree $T$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. The only
lower bound for trees is given by a recent result of Fiorenzi et al. (2011)
that for any $\Delta$ there is a tree $T$ such that
$\pi_l(T)=\Omega(\frac{\log\Delta}{\log\log\Delta})$. We also show that if one
allows repetitions in a coloring but still forbid 3 identical consecutive
blocks of colors on any simple path, then a constant size of the lists allows
to color any tree.

particles were computed with a modified lubrication model called Fast
Lubrication Dynamics. Studies were conducted for a wide range of volume
fractions between $0.3 \leq \phi \leq 0.5$ and P\`{e}clet numbers between $0
\leq Pe \leq 1000$. The microstructure was found to be disordered at all volume
fractions, though signatures of weak string like ordering were evident
particularly in $\phi=0.5$ homonuclear suspensions at intermediate to high
shear rates ($Pe$ in the range 10-100). Complex orientation behavior was
observed as a function of shape, shear rates, and volume fractions. At very low
shear rates, random orientation distribution was observed in all cases. At the
highest shear rates, orientation distribution in suspensions of homonuclear
particles exhibited a shift towards an alignment with the vorticity axis at all
volume fractions, while in suspensions of fused-dumbbells it exhibited a shift
away from the vorticity axis at low volume fractions and a negligible shift at
higher volume fractions. The orientation behavior is further characterized by
examining the orientation distribution in the velocity--gradient plane -- in
this case an increased particle alignment with the velocity axis is generally
observed with increasing volume fractions, but not universally with increasing
shear rates. Mechanistic origins for the complex orientation behavior as a
function of shear rate, volume fraction, and particle shape is described.
