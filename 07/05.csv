phase with gapless excitations and the even-parity dimer and Neel phases with
gapped excitations, in addition to the Haldane dimer phase. Furthermore, we
show the existence of gapped phases with coexisting orders in narrow regions

generated through the curvaton mechanism from a scalar field with an electric
charge, or precisely the Standard Model U(1) weak hypercharge. This links the
dynamics of the very early universe concretely to the Standard Model of
particle physics, and because the coupling strength is known, it reduces the
number of free parameters in the curvaton model. The gauge coupling also
introduces several new physical effects. Charge fluctuations are generated
during inflation, but they are screened by electron-positron pairs therefore do
not violate observational constraints. After inflation, the curvaton interacts
with thermal radiation which destroys the curvaton condensate and prevents the
generation of curvature perturbations, unless the inflaton dynamics satisfy
strong constraints. The curvaton also experiences a period of parametric
resonance with the U(1) gauge field. Using the standard perturbative approach,
we find that the model can generate the observed density perturbation for
Hubble rate H_* > 10^8 GeV and curvaton mass m > 0.01 H_*, but with a level of
non-Gaussianity (f_NL > 130) that violates observational constraints. However,

symplectic space. We present the physical motivation for studying singularities
of the Wigner caustic on shell and present its mathematical definition in terms
of a generating family. Because such a generating family is an odd deformation
of an odd function, we study simple singularities in the category of odd
functions and their odd versal deformations, applying these results to classify
the singularities of the Wigner caustic on shell, interpreting these
singularities in terms of the local geometry of L.

times larger than the mass of its isospin partner, the bottom quark. It decays
almost 100% of the time to a $W$ boson and a bottom quark. Using top-antitop
pairs at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider, the CDF and {\dzero}
collaborations have measured the top quark's mass in different final states for
integrated luminosities of up to 5.8 fb$^{-1}$. This paper reports on a
combination of these measurements that results in a more precise value of the
mass than any individual decay channel can provide. It describes the treatment
of the systematic uncertainties and their correlations. The mass value
determined is $173.18 \pm 0.56 \thinspace ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.75 \thinspace
({\rm syst})$ GeV or $173.18 \pm 0.94$ GeV, which has a precision of $\pm

a time-dependent radial perturbation. The equation of the perturbation includes
nonlinearity up to any arbitrary order, and bears a form that is very similar
to the metric equation of an analogue acoustic black hole. Casting the
perturbation as a standing wave on subsonic solutions, and maintaining
nonlinearity in it up to the second order, we get the time-dependence of the
perturbation in the form of a Li\'enard system. A dynamical systems analysis of
the Li\'enard system reveals a saddle point in real time, with the implication
that instabilities will develop in the accreting system when the perturbation
is extended into the nonlinear regime. The instability of initial subsonic
states also adversely affects the temporal evolution of the flow towards a
final and stable transonic state.

model on the honeycomb lattice at half-filling, we apply both perturbative and
non-perturbative techniques to derive effective spin Hamiltonians describing
the low-energy physics of the Mott-insulating phase of the system. Exact
diagonalizations of the so-derived models on small clusters are performed, in
order to assess the quality of the effective low-energy theory in the
spin-liquid regime. We show that six-spin interactions on the elementary loop
of the honeycomb lattice are the dominant sub-leading effective couplings. A
minimal spin model is shown to reproduce most of the energetic properties of
the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice in its spin-liquid phase.
Surprisingly, a more elaborate effective low-energy spin model obtained by a
systematic graph expansion rather disagrees beyond a certain point with the
numerical results for the Hubbard model at intermediate couplings.

static and dynamic properties when experiencing an effective transverse
staggered field originating from the varying local environment of the
individual spins. We present a temperature-, angular- and field-dependent 29Si
NMR study of the model compound BaCu2Si2O7. The experimental data are
interpreted in terms of the divergent low-temperature transverse
susceptibility, predicted by theory for spin chains in coexisting longitudinal
and transverse staggered fields. Our analysis first employs a
finite-temperature ""Density Matrix Renormalization Group"" (DMRG) study of the
relevant one-dimensional Hamiltonian. Next we compare our numerical with the
presently known analytical results. With an analysis based on crystal
symmetries we show how the anisotropic contribution to the sample magnetization
is experimentally accessible even below the ordering temperature, in spite of
its competition with the collinear order parameter of the antiferromagnetic
phase. The modification of static and dynamic properties of the system due to
the presence of a local transverse staggered field (LTSF) acting on the
one-dimensional spin array are argued to cause the unusual spin reorientation
transitions observed in BaCu2Si2O7. On the basis of a Ginzburg-Landau type
analysis, we discuss aspects of competing spin structures in the presence of
magnetic order and the enhanced transverse susceptibility.

exploiting measurements of the magnitude gap, m12, defined as the difference
between the r-band absolute magnitude of the two brightest cluster members. We
find that in a mock sample of galaxy groups and clusters constructed from the
Bolshoi simulation, the scatter about the mass-richness relation decreases by
15-20% when magnitude gap information is included. A similar trend is evident
in a volume-limited, spectroscopic sample of galaxy groups observed in the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find that SDSS groups with small magnitude
gaps are richer than large-gap groups at fixed values of the one-dimensional
velocity dispersion among group members sigma_v, which we use as a mass proxy.
We demonstrate explicitly that m12 contains information about cluster mass that
supplements the information provided by group richness and the luminosity of
the brightest cluster galaxy, L_bcg. In so doing, we show that the luminosities
of the members of a group with richness N are inconsistent with the
distribution of luminosities that results from N random draws from the global
galaxy luminosity function. As the cosmological constraining power of galaxy
clusters is limited by the precision in cluster mass determination, our
findings suggest a new way to improve the cosmological constraints derived from
galaxy clusters.

In this review article, we survey common computational methods used to study

reaching to quantum chemistry and density functional theory. We sketch their
underlying frameworks and investigate their strengths and weaknesses when
applied to potentially large biomolecules. In particular, density functional
theory---a framework that can treat thousands of atoms on firm theoretical
ground---can now accurately describe systems dominated by weak van der Waals
interactions. This newfound ability has rekindled interest in using this
tried-and-true approach to investigate biological systems of real importance.
In this review, we focus on some new methods within density functional theory
that allow for accurate inclusion of the weak interactions that dominate
binding in biological macromolecules. Recent work utilizing these methods to
study biologically-relevant systems will be highlighted, and a vision for the
future of density functional theory within molecular biology will be discussed.

with small momentum transfer near the bottom of the electron spectrum.
Importantly, pairwise forward scattering in the vicinity of the Fermi surface
alone is not sufficient to produce a nonzero dc drag resistivity $\rho_{\rm

this mechanism of scattering before. We show that slow equilibration between
two subsystems of electrons of opposite chirality, ""bottlenecked"" by inelastic

leads to a strong suppression of Coulomb drag, which results in an activation
dependence of $\rho_{\rm D}$ on temperature---instead of the conventional power

Taking into account the experimental constraints from previous direct searches,
flavour physics, electroweak measurements as well as theoretical

rate equal to, or above, the SM prediction is viable over the full mass range
$123\gev \lsim M_H \lsim 127\gev$, both in the MSSM and the NMSSM. We find that
besides the interpretation of a possible signal at about $125\gev$ in terms of
the lightest $\cp$-even Higgs boson, both the MSSM and the NMSSM permit also a
viable interpretation where an observed state at about $125\gev$ would
correspond to the second-lightest $\cp$-even Higgs boson in the spectrum, which
would be accompanied by another light Higgs with suppressed couplings to $W$
and $Z$ bosons. We find that a significant enhancement of the $\ga\ga$ rate,
compatible with the signal strenghts observed by ATLAS and CMS, is possible in
both the MSSM and the NMSSM, and we analyse in detail different mechanisms in

on opposite sides of the Fermi surface. The Fermi velocities at these pairs of
points are in general not parallel. Here we consider the case where pairs of
hot spots coalesce, and the wave vector (\pi,\pi) of the SDW connects hot spots
with parallel Fermi velocities. Using the specific example of electron-doped
cuprates, we first show that Kanamori screening and generic features of the
Lindhard function make this case experimentally relevant. The temperature
dependence of the correlation length, the spin susceptibility and the
self-energy at the hot spots are found using the Two-Particle-Self-Consistent
theory and specific numerical examples worked out for parameters characteristic
of the electron-doped cuprates. While the curvature of the Fermi surface at the
hot spots leads to deviations from perfect nesting, the pseudo-nesting
conditions lead to drastic modifications to the temperature dependence of these
physical observables: Neglecting logarithmic corrections, the correlation
length \xi scales like 1/T, i.e. z=1 instead of the naive z=2, the (\pi,\pi)
static spin susceptibility \chi like $1/\sqrt T$, and the imaginary part of the
self-energy at the hot spots like $T^{3/2}$. The correction $T_1^{-1}\sim
T^{3/2}$ to the Korringa NMR relaxation rate is subdominant. We also consider
this problem at zero temperature, or for frequencies larger than temperature,
using a field-theoretical model of gapless SDW fluctuations interacting with
fermions. The imaginary part of the fermionic self-energy close to the hot
spots scales as $-\omega^{3/2}\log\omega$. This is less singular than earlier
predictions of the form $-\omega\log\omega$. The difference arises from the
effects of umklapp terms that were not included in previous studies.

J1701-462 in its Sco-like Z phase, the branches of GX 17+2 can be explained by
three processes operating at a constant accretion rate Mdot into the disk:
increase of Comptonization up the horizontal branch, transition from a standard
thin disk to a slim disk up the normal branch, and temporary fast decrease of
the inner disk radius up the flaring branch. We also model the Comptonization
in an empirically self-consistent way, with its seed photons tied to the
thermal disk component and corrected for to recover the pre-Comptonized thermal
disk emission. This allows us to show a constant Mdot along the entire Z track
based on the thermal disk component. We also measure the upper kHz QPO
frequency and find it to depend on the apparent inner disk radius R_in (prior
to Compton scattering) approximately as frequency \propto R_in^(-3/2),
supporting the idenfitication of it as the Keplerian frequency at R_in. The
horizontal branch oscillation is probably related to the dynamics in the inner
disk as well, as both its frequency and R_in vary significantly on the
horizontal branch but become relatively constant on the normal branch.

such lopsided configurations if and when stimulated by external perturbations.
Here, we present results of N-body simulations which show unstable
counter-rotating stellar clusters around super-massive black holes saturating
into uniformly precessing lopsided nuclei. The double nucleus in our featured
experiment decomposes naturally into a thick eccentric disk of apo-apse aligned
stars which is embedded in a lighter triaxial cluster. The eccentric disk
reproduces key features of Keplerian disk models of Andromeda's double nucleus;
the triaxial cluster has a distinctive kinematic signature which is evident in
HST observations of Andromeda's double nucleus, and has been difficult to
reproduce with Keplerian disks alone. Our simulations demonstrate how the
combination of eccentric disk and triaxial cluster arises naturally when a star
cluster accreted over a pre-existing and counter-rotating disk of stars, drives
disk and cluster into a mutually destabilizing dance. Such accretion events are
inherent to standard galaxy formation scenarios. They are here shown to double

Gannon-Lee-type singularity theorem based on the existence of marginally outer
trapped surfaces (MOTS) on noncompact initial data sets for globally hyperbolic
spacetimes. This result requires that the MOTS be generic in a suitable sense.
In the same spirit, this author has proven some variants of that result which
hold for weaker causal conditions on spacetime, but which concern (generic)
marginally trapped surfaces (MTS) rather than MOTS, i.e., most of the results
need a condition on the convergence of the ingoing family of normal null
geodesics as well. However, much of the more recent literature has focused on
MOTS rather than MTS as quasi-local substitutes for the description of black
holes, as they are arguably more natural and easier to handle in a number of
situations. It is therefore pertinent to ask to what extent one can deduce the
existence of singularities in the presence of MOTS alone. In this note, we
address this issue and show that singularities still arise in the presence of

clustering from measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy
clustering. We present new cosmological parameter constraints based on
large-scale measurements of spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 7 (DR7). We generalise the approach of Baldauf
et al. (2010) to remove small scale information (below 2 and 4 Mpc/h for
lensing and clustering measurements, respectively), where the cross-correlation
coefficient differs from unity. We derive constraints for three galaxy samples
covering 7131 sq. deg., containing 69150, 62150, and 35088 galaxies with mean
redshifts of 0.11, 0.28, and 0.40. We clearly detect scale-dependent galaxy
bias for the more luminous galaxy samples, at a level consistent with
theoretical expectations. When we vary both \sigma_8 and \Omega_m (and
marginalise over non-linear galaxy bias) in a flat LCDM model, the
best-constrained quantity is \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.25)^{0.57}=0.80 +/- 0.05
(1-sigma, stat. + sys.), where statistical and systematic errors have
comparable contributions, and we fixed n_s=0.96 and h=0.7. These strong
constraints on the matter clustering suggest that this method is competitive
with cosmic shear in current data, while having very complementary and in some
ways less serious systematics. We therefore expect that this method will play a
prominent role in future weak lensing surveys. When we combine these data with
WMAP7 CMB data, constraints on \sigma_8, \Omega_m, H_0, w_{de} and \sum m_{\nu}
become 30--80 per cent tighter than with CMB data alone, since our data break
several parameter degeneracies.

point, however, is known to be associated with undesirable power oscillations
which require closed-loop control strategies to regulate the aggregate power

It is shown analytically and verified numerically that by shifting the set
point ""safely"" the aggregate power consumption can be changed to a different
value within a time frame of the order of a TCL's cycle duration and avoid the
undesired oscillations seen otherwise in a ""sudden"" shift. We discuss how the
excess aggregate energy transferred under a safe shift in the set point could
potentially mitigate the burden due to abnormal energy generation within a

sum of certain hypergeometric functions and more generally the same can be done
with polylogarithms, for which several zeta functions are a special case. An
analytic continuation formula for these hypergeometric functions exists and is
used to derive some infinite sums which allow the zeta function at integer
arguments n to be written as a weighted infinite sum of hypergeometric
functions at n - 1. The form might be considered to be a shift operator for the
Riemann zeta function which leads to the curious values {\zeta}F(0) = I_0(2) -
1 and {\zeta}F(1) = Ei(1) - {\gamma} which involve a Bessel function of the
first kind and an exponential integral respectively and differ from the values
{\zeta}(0) = -1/2 and {\zeta}(1) = \infty given by the usual method of
continuation. Interpreting these ""hypergeometrically continued"" values of the
zeta constants in terms of reciprocal common factor probability we have
{\zeta}F(0)^-1 \sim 78.15% and {\zeta}F(1)^-1 \sim 75.88% which contrasts with
the standard known values for sensible cases like {\zeta}(2)^-1 \sim 60.79% and
{\zeta}(3)^-1 \sim 83.19%. The combinatorial definitions of the Stirling
numbers of the second kind, and the 2-restricted Stirling numbers of the second
kind are recalled because they appear in the differential equatlon satisfied by
the hypergeometric representation of the polylogarithm. The notion of fractal
strings is related to the (chaotic) Gauss map of the unit interval which arises
in the study of continued fractions, and another chaotic map is also introduced
called the ""Harmonic sawtooth"" whose Mellin transform is the (appropritately
scaled) Riemann zeta function. These maps are within the family of what might
be called ""deterministic chaos"". Some number theoretic definitions are also

Sagittarius containing several candidate Supernova Remnants and obtained deep
optical narrow-band images and spectra to explore their nature. The images of
the unstudied area have been obtained in the light of Halpha+[N II], [S II] and
[O III]. The resulting mosaic covers an area of 1.4x1.0 deg^2 where filamentary
and diffuse emission was discovered, suggesting the existence of more than one
supernova remnants (SNRs) in the area. Deep long slit spectra were also taken
of eight different regions. Both the flux calibrated images and the spectra
show that the emission from the filamentary structures originates from
shock-heated gas, while the photo-ionization mechanism is responsible for the
diffuse emission. Part of the optical emission is found to be correlated with
the radio at 4850 MHz suggesting their association, while the WISE infrared
emission found in the area at 12 and 22 micron marginally correlates with the
optical. The presence of the [O III] emission line in one of the candidate SNRs
suggests shock velocities into the interstellar ""clouds"" between 120 and 200
km/s, while the absence in the other indicates slower shock velocities. For all
candidate remnants the [S II] 6716/6731 ratio indicates electron densities
below 240 cm^{-3}, while the Halpha emission has been measured to be between
0.6 to 41x10^{-17} erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2. The existence of eight pulsars within
1.5deg away from the center of the candidate SNRs also supports the scenario of
many SNRs in the area as well as that the detected optical emission could be
part of a number of supernovae explosions.

  Sensing Networks","24 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables, submitted",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Radio frequency (RF) sensing networks are a class of wireless sensor networks
(WSNs) which use RF signals to accomplish tasks such as passive device-free
localization and tracking. The algorithms used for these tasks usually require
access to measurements of baseline received signal strength (RSS) on each link.
However, it is often impossible to collect this calibration data (measurements
collected during an offline calibration period when the region of interest is
empty of targets). We propose adapting background subtraction methods from the
field of computer vision to estimate baseline RSS values from measurements
taken while the system is online and obstructions may be present. This is done
by forming an analogy between the intensity of a background pixel in an image
and the baseline RSS value of a WSN link and then translating the concepts of
temporal similarity, spatial similarity and spatial ergodicity which underlie
specific background subtraction algorithms to WSNs. Using experimental data, we
show that these techniques are capable of estimating baseline RSS values with
enough accuracy that RF tomographic tracking can be carried out in a variety of
different environments without the need for a calibration period.

limited ringdown that perform a desired quantum operation in the presence of
resonator distortions of the ideal waveform. Inclusion of ringdown suppression
in numerical pulse optimizations significantly reduces spectrometer deadtime
when using high quality factor (high-Q) resonators, leading to increased
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity of inductive measurements. To
demonstrate the method, we experimentally measure the free-induction decay of
an inhomogeneously broadened solid-state free radical spin system at high Q.
The measurement is enabled by using a numerically optimized bandwidth-limited
OCT pulse, including ringdown suppression, robust to variations in static and
microwave field strengths. We also discuss the applications of pulse design in
high-Q resonators to universal control of anisotropic-hyperfine coupled
electron-nuclear spin systems via electron-only modulation even when the
bandwidth of the resonator is significantly smaller than the hyperfine coupling
strength. These results demonstrate how limitations imposed by linear response
theory may be vastly exceeded when using a sufficiently accurate system model

close to 1, is list decodable at radius (1-1/q-\epsilon) with list size
L=O(1/\epsilon^2) and rate R=\Omega_q(\epsilon^2/(log^3(1/\epsilon))). Up to
the polylogarithmic factor in (1/\epsilon) and constant factors depending on q,
this matches the lower bound L=\Omega_q(1/\epsilon^2) for the list size and
upper bound R=O_q(\epsilon^2) for the rate. Previously only existence (and not
abundance) of such codes was known for the special case q=2 (Guruswami,
H{\aa}stad, Sudan and Zuckerman, 2002).
  In order to obtain our result, we employ a relaxed version of the well known
Johnson bound on list decoding that translates the average Hamming distance
between codewords to list decoding guarantees. We furthermore prove that the
desired average-distance guarantees hold for a code provided that a natural
complex matrix encoding the codewords satisfies the Restricted Isometry
Property with respect to the Euclidean norm (RIP-2). For the case of random
binary linear codes, this matrix coincides with a random submatrix of the
Hadamard-Walsh transform matrix that is well studied in the compressed sensing
literature.
  Finally, we improve the analysis of Rudelson and Vershynin (2008) on the
number of random frequency samples required for exact reconstruction of
k-sparse signals of length N. Specifically, we improve the number of samples
from O(k log(N) log^2(k) (log k + loglog N)) to O(k log(N) log^3(k)). The proof
involves bounding the expected supremum of a related Gaussian process by using
an improved analysis of the metric defined by the process. This improvement is
crucial for our application in list decoding.

deviation from the Coulombic law of conduction in high fields. One of the
important aims of the present line of work was in removing or avoiding the
divergence difficulty in calculating the electrophoretic and relaxation time
coefficients. The present work achieves that aim by calculating on the basis of
computing the axial velocity profiles the position of the center of the ion
atmosphere as a function of the reduced field strength and therewith computing
the electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients for the migrating
spherical ion atmosphere at each value of the reduced field strength. With the
electrophoretic and relaxation time coefficients thus calculated along the
trajectory of the center of the ion atmosphere with regard to the reduced field
strength, the equivalent ionic conductance of a magnesium sulfate solution is
calculated and compared with experimental data in very good accuracy. It is
also compared with the prediction by Wilson's theory and is found very much
improved over the latter. Moreover, the present method is divergence-free
unlike Wilson's theory. It therefore not only sheds a new light on the
nonequilibrium liquid structure of ionic solutions and the motion of ion
atmosphere in an electric field, but also shows how the Onsager--Wilson theory
of conductance in electrolyte solutions should be applied to account for the

cryptosystem) has its encryption speed having a complexity order faster than
the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, El-Gammal, RSA and ECC. It can also transmit a
larger data set securely when compared to existing asymmetric schemes. It has a
simple mathematical structure. Thus, it would have low computational
requirements and would enable communication devices with low computing power to
deploy secure communication procedures efficiently.

advantage of QMD is that we can study dynamical processes of nucleon many-body

inhomogeneous structures of low-density nuclear matter consisting not only of
spherical nuclei but also of nuclear ""pasta"", i.e., rod-like and slab-like
nuclei. We show that the pasta phases can appear in the ground and equilibrium
states of nuclear matter without assuming nuclear shape. Next we show our
simulation of compression of nuclear matter which corresponds to the collapsing
stage of supernovae. With increase of density, a crystalline solid of spherical
nuclei change to a triangular lattice of rods by connecting neighboring nuclei.

complementary methods (Hilbert transform and Fourier power spectra). Horizontal

  The net energy flux is upward. In the range 3-10 mHz, a full FOV space and
time averaged flux of 2700 W m$^{-2}$ (lower layer 80-130 km) and 2000 W
m$^{-2}$ (upper layer 130-180 km) is concentrated in less than 1% of the solar
surface in the form of narrow (0.3$""$) AE. Their total duration (including rise

a potential candidate for cost sensitive, safety critical and space conserving

largely over estimated Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) bounds of applications.
In this report we present the DPQ together with an algorithm to predict the

located in the QSO host galaxies. 4 (7%) of the candidates turned out to be
late-type stars, and another 4 (7%) are compact galaxies. The remaining 4
objects we could not identify. In terms of their optical spectra the QSOs are
similar to the QSOs selected in the FIRST-2MASS red Quasar survey except they
are on average fainter, more distant and only two are detected in the FIRST
survey. We estimate the amount of extinction using the SDSS QSO template
reddened by SMC-like dust. It is possible to get a good match to the observed
(restframe ultraviolet) spectra, but for nearly all the reddened QSOs it is not
possible to match the near-IR photometry from UKIDSS. The likely reasons are
that the SDSS QSO template is too red at optical wavelengths due to
contaminating host galaxy light and that the assumed SMC extinction curve is
too shallow. Our survey has demonstrated that selection of QSOs based on
near-IR photometry is an efficent way to select QSOs, including reddened QSOs,
with only small contamination from late-type stars and compact galaxies. This
will be useful with ongoing and future wide-field near-IR surveys such as the

group to explain peculiar features visible in the polarized radio maps. We
analyzed soft X-ray (0.2-1 keV) emission from NGC 3627 to study the

galaxy. Any change throughout the disk can reflect distortions visible in the
radio polarized emission. We also studied two bright point sources that are

the temperature of the hot gas in the area of the polarized radio ridge in the
western arm of the galaxy. In the eastern part of the disk we find two

spread of fads and opinions. Along with models of epidemics, they constitute a
major theoretical framework of social spreading processes. In threshold models
on static networks, an individual changes her state if a certain fraction of
her neighbors has done the same. When there are strong correlations in the
temporal aspects of contact patterns, it is useful to represent the system as a
temporal network. In such a system, not only contacts but also the time of the
contacts are represented explicitly. There is a consensus that bursty temporal
patterns slow down disease spreading. However, as we will see, this is not a
universal truth for threshold models. In this work, we propose an extension of
Watts' classic threshold model to temporal networks. We do this by assuming
that an agent is influenced by contacts which lie a certain time into the past.
I.e., the individuals are affected by contacts within a time window. In
addition to thresholds as the fraction of contacts, we also investigate the
number of contacts within the time window as a basis for influence. To
elucidate the model's behavior, we run the model on real and randomized
empirical contact datasets.

  Congress of Mathematics",,,,"math.AG math.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we deal with branched coverings over the complement to finitely
many exceptional points on the Riemann sphere having the property that the
local monodromy around each of the branching points is of finite order. To such
a covering we assign its \textit{signature}, i.e. the set of its exceptional
and branching points together with the orders of local monodromy operators
around the branching points.
  What can be said about the monodromy group of a branched covering if its
signature is known? It seems at first that the answer is nothing or next to
nothing. Indeed, generically it is so. However there is a (small) list of
signatures of \textit{elliptic} and \textit{parabolic} types, for which the
monodromy group can be described completely, or at least determined up to an
abelian factor. This appendix is devoted to investigation of these signatures.
For all these signatures (with one exception) the corresponding monodromy
groups turn out to be solvable.
  Linear differential equations of Fuchs type related to these signatures are
solvable in quadratures (in the case of elliptic signatures --- in algebraic
functions). A well-known example of this type is provided by Euler differential
equations, which can be reduced to linear differential equations with constant
coefficients.
  The algebraic functions related to all (but one) of these signatures are
expressible in radicals. A simple example of this kind is provided by the
possibility to express the inverse of a Chebyshev polynomial in radicals.
Another example of this kind is provided by functions related to division
theorems for the argument of elliptic functions. Such functions play a central
role in the work [1] of Ritt.

the Stueckelberg auxiliary fields. The explicit form of the Lagrangians and the
gauge transformation laws are found. The theory can be written in terms of
gauge-invariant objects similar to the massless theories, thus allowing us to
hope to use the same methods for investigation of interactions. In the massive
spin 3 field example we are able to rewrite the Lagrangian using the new the
so-called separated variables, so that the study of Lagrangian formulation
reduces to finding the Lagrangian containing only half of the fields. The same
construction takes places for arbitrary integer spin field as well. Further
working in terms of separated variables, we build Lagrangian for arbitrary
integer spin and write it in terms of gauge-invariant objects. Also, we
demonstrate how to restore the full set of variables, thus receiving Lagrangian

analogy with existing literature, aggregates can grow, nucleate and fragment
stochastically. We assume that the quality control system acts as an enzyme
that can degrade aggregates at different stages of the growth process, with an
efficiency that decreases with the size of the aggregate. We show how this
stochastic dynamics, depending on the parameter choice, leads to two
qualitatively different behaviors: a homeostatic state, where the quality
control system is stable and aggregates of large sizes are not formed, and an
oscillatory state, where the quality control system periodically breaks down,
allowing for the formation of large aggregates. We discuss how these periodic
breakdowns may constitute a mechanism for the sporadic development of
neurodegenerative diseases.

proto-neutron star stage. This high accretion episode can submerge the magnetic
field deep in the crust. The diffusion of the magnetic field back to the
surface will take hundreds to millions of years depending on the amount of mass
accreted and the consequent depth the field is buried. Neutron stars with large
kick velocities will accrete less amount of fallback material leading to
shallower submergence of their fields and shorter time-scales for the growth of
their fields. We obtain the relation $\tau_{\rm Ohm} \propto v^{-1}$ between
the space velocity of the neutron star and Ohmic time-scale for the growth of
the magnetic field. We compare this with the relation between the measured
transverse velocities, $v_{\perp}$ and the field growth time-scales,
$\mu/\dot{\mu}$, inferred from the measured braking indices. We find that the
observational data is consistent with the theoretical prediction though the
small number of data precludes a strong conclusion. Measurement of the
transverse velocities of pulsars B1509$-$58, J1846$-$0258, J1119$-$6127 and

estimates when inferring network structures, and much recent progress has been
made for Gaussian models. These models have been used extensively in
applications to gene expression data, even in cases where there appears to be
significant deviations from the Gaussian model. For more robust inferences, it
is natural to consider extensions to t-distribution models. We argue that the
classical multivariate t-distribution, defined using a single latent Gamma
random variable to rescale a Gaussian random vector, is of little use in highly
multivariate settings, and propose other, more flexible t-distributions. Using
an independent Gamma-divisor for each component of the random vector defines
what we term the alternative t-distribution. The associated model allows one to
extract information from highly multivariate data even when most experiments
contain outliers for some of their measurements. However, the use of this
alternative model comes at increased computational cost and imposes constraints
on the achievable correlation structures, raising the need for a compromise
between the classical and alternative models. To this end we propose the use of
Dirichlet processes for adaptive clustering of the latent Gamma-scalars, each
of which may then divide a group of latent Gaussian variables. Dirichlet
processes are commonly used to cluster independent observations; here they are
used instead to cluster the dependent components of a single observation. The
resulting Dirichlet t-distribution interpolates naturally between the two
extreme cases of the classical and alternative t-distributions and combines
more appealing modeling of the multivariate dependence structure with favorable
computational properties.

earlier during outbursts compared to quiescence and that the width of the

the two-dimensional (2D) positions of a moving test particle in regular time
intervals. The resulting sample trajectories are then used to induce the
properties of the underlying stochastic process. Often, it can be assumed a
priori that the underlying discrete-time random walk model is independent from
absolute position (homogeneity), direction (isotropy) and time (stationarity),
as well as ergodic. In this article we first review some common statistical
methods for analyzing 2D trajectories, based on quantities with built-in
rotational invariance. We then discuss an alternative approach in which the
two-dimensional trajectories are reduced to one dimension by projection onto an
arbitrary axis and rotational averaging. Each step of the resulting 1D
trajectory is further factorized into sign and magnitude. The statistical
properties of the signs and magnitudes are mathematically related to those of
the step lengths and turning angles of the original 2D trajectories,
demonstrating that no essential information is lost by this data reduction. The
resulting binary sequence of signs lends itself for a pattern counting
analysis, revealing temporal properties of the random process that are not
easily deduced from conventional measures such as the velocity autocorrelation
function. In order to highlight this simplified 1D description, we apply it to
a 2D random walk with restricted turning angles (RTA model), defined by a
finite-variance distribution $p(L)$ of step length and a narrow turning angle
distribution $p(\phi)$, assuming that the lengths and directions of the steps

normal and inverted mass hierarchies are permitted within $3\sigma$
experimental bounds, with the prediction of small (large) deviations from
maximality in the atmospheric mixing angle for the normal (inverted) case.
Interestingly, we show that the inverted case is excluded by the global
analysis in $1\sigma$ experimental bounds, while the most recent MINOS data
seem to favor the inverted case. Our model make predictions for the Dirac CP
phase in the normal and inverted hierarchies, which can be tested in
near-future neutrino oscillation experiments. Our model also predicts the

latent variables. HOPLS differs substantially from other regression models in
that it explains the data by a sum of orthogonal Tucker tensors, while the
number of orthogonal loadings serves as a parameter to control model complexity
and prevent overfitting. The low dimensional latent space is optimized
sequentially via a deflation operation, yielding the best joint subspace
approximation for both $\tensor{X}$ and $\tensor{Y}$. Instead of decomposing
$\tensor{X}$ and $\tensor{Y}$ individually, higher order singular value
decomposition on a newly defined generalized cross-covariance tensor is
employed to optimize the orthogonal loadings. A systematic comparison on both

dust aggregates levitating at mbar pressures and elevated temperatures of 800
K. We report on collisions between basalt dust aggregates of from 0.3 to 5 mm
in size at velocities between 0.1 and 15 cm/s. Individual grains are smaller
than 25 \mum in size. We find that for all impact energies in the studied range
sticking occurs at a probability of 32.1 \pm 2.5% on average. In general, the
sticking probability decreases with increasing impact parameter. The sticking
probability increases with energy density (impact energy per contact area). We
also observe collisions of aggregates that were formed by a previous sticking
of two larger aggregates. Partners of these aggregates can be detached by a
second collision with a probability of on average 19.8 \pm 4.0%. The measured
accretion efficiencies are remarkably high compared to other experimental
results. We attribute this to the rel. large dust grains used in our
experiments, which make aggregates more susceptible to restructuring and energy
dissipation. Collisional hardening by compaction might not occur as the
aggregates are already very compact with only 54 \pm 1% porosity. The
disassembly of previously grown aggregates in collisions might stall further
aggregate growth. However, owing to the levitation technique and the limited
data statistics, no conclusive statement about this aspect can yet be given. We
find that the detachment efficiency decreases with increasing velocities and
accretion dominates in the higher velocity range. For high accretion
efficiencies, our experiments suggest that continued growth in the mm-range
with larger constituent grains would be a viable way to produce larger
aggregates, which might in turn form the seeds to proceed to growing
planetesimals.

evolutionary models. Homogeneity of the evolutionary process imposes fixed
rates of evolution throughout the tree. In complex data problems this
assumption is likely to put the results of the analyses in question.
  In this work we propose an algorithm for parameter and branch lengths
inference in the discrete-time Markov processes on trees. This broad class of
nonhomogeneous models comprises the general Markov model and all its submodels,
including both stationary and nonstationary models.
  Here, we adapted the well-known Expectation-Maximization algorithm and
present a detailed performance study of this approach for a selection of
nonhomogeneous evolutionary models. We conducted an extensive performance
assessment on multiple sequence alignments simulated under a variety of
settings. We demonstrated high accuracy of the tool in parameter estimation and
branch lengths recovery, proving the method to be a valuable tool for
phylogenetic inference in real life problems. $\empar$ is an open-source C++
implementation of the methods introduced in this paper and is the first tool
designed to handle nonhomogeneous data.

It is shown that although the quantum discord for particular initial states may
be perfectly preserved over some finite time window in the absence of any

(known orbital motion of the Earth) and orbital motion of the lens yields a
binary lens mass ratio of q = 0.321 +/- 0.007 and a projected separation of s =
0.072 +/- 0.001$ in units of the Einstein radius. The parallax parameters allow
us to determine the lens distance D_L = 3.11 +/- 0.39 kpc and total mass
M_L=1.40 +/- 0.18 M_sun; this leads to the primary and secondary components
having masses of M_1 = 1.06 +/- 0.13 M_sun and M_2 = 0.34 +/- 0.04 M_sun,
respectively. The parallax model indicates that the binary lens system is
likely constructed by the main sequence stars. On the other hand, we used a
Bayesian analysis to estimate probability distributions by the model that
includes the effects of xallarap (possible orbital motion of the source around
a companion) and parallax (q = 0.270 +/- 0.005, s = 0.083 +/- 0.001). The
primary component of the binary lens is relatively massive with M_1 =
0.9_{-0.3}^{+4.6} M_sun and it is at a distance of D_L = 2.6_{-0.9}^{+3.8} kpc.
Given the secure mass ratio measurement, the companion mass is therefore M_2 =
0.2_{-0.1}^{+1.2} M_sun. The xallarap model implies that the primary lens is
likely a stellar remnant, such as a white dwarf, a neutron star or a black
hole.

that: (i) the quantum expectation value of the position operator coincides at
any time with the searched classical trajectory, $< \psi_{EMWF} | {\hat {\vec

to relativistic quantum mechanics. There is substantial agreement with Bohr's
viewpoint: the macroscopic description of the preparation, certain intermediate

climate of a planet around the habitable zone. A thorough investigation of the
thermodynamics of the climate system is performed for very diverse conditions
of energy input and infrared atmosphere opacity. Using PlaSim, an Earth-like
general circulation model, the solar constant S* is modulated between 1160 and
1510 Wm-2 and the CO2 concentration, [CO2], from 90 to 2880 ppm. It is observed
that in such a parameter range the climate is bistable, i.e. there are two
coexisting attractors, one characterised by warm, moist climates (W) and one by
completely frozen sea surface (Snowball Earth, SB). Linear relationships are
found for the two transition lines (W\rightarrowSB and SB\rightarrowW) in
(S*,[CO2]) between S* and the logarithm of [CO2]. The dynamical and
thermodynamical properties - energy fluxes, Lorenz energy cycle, Carnot
efficiency, material entropy production - of the W and SB states are very
different: W states are dominated by the hydrological cycle and latent heat is
prominent in the material entropy production; the SB states are predominantly
dry climates where heat transport is realized through sensible heat fluxes and
entropy mostly generated by dissipation of kinetic energy. We also show that
the Carnot efficiency regularly increases towards each transition between W and
SB, with a large decrease in each transition. Finally, we propose well-defined
empirical functions allowing for expressing the global non-equilibrium
thermodynamical properties of the system in terms of either the mean surface
temperature or the mean planetary emission temperature. This paves the way for
the possibility of proposing efficient parametrisations of complex
non-equilibrium properties and of practically deducing fundamental properties
of a planetary system from a relatively simple observable.

a narrow gaped armchair graphene nanoribbon (GNR) is performed. We employ the
adiabatic approximation assuming that the motions parallel (""slow"") and
perpendicular (""fast"") to the boundaries of the ribbon are separated
adiabatically. The energy spectrum comprises a sequence of series of
quasi-Rydberg levels relevant to the ""slow"" motion adjacent from the low
energies to the size-quantized levels associated with the ""fast"" motion. Only
the series attributed to the ground size-quantized sub-band is really discrete,
while others corresponding to the excited sub-bands consist of quasi-discrete
(Fano resonant) levels of non-zero energetic widths, caused by the coupling
with the states of the continuous spectrum branching from the low lying
sub-bands. In the two- and three-subband approximation the spectrum of the
complex energies of the impurity electron is derived in an explicit form.
Narrowing the GNR leads to an increase of the binding energy and the resonant
width both induced by the finite width of the ribbon. Displacing the impurity
centre from the mid-point of the GNR causes the binding energy to decrease
while the resonant width of the first excited Rydberg series increases. As for
the second excited series their widths become narrower with the shift of the
impurity. A successful comparison of our analytical results with those obtained
by other theoretical and experimental methods is presented. Estimates of the
binding energies and the resonant widths taken for the parameters of typical
GNRs show that not only the strictly discrete but also the some resonant states
are quite stable and could be studied experimentally in doped GNRs.

In our model, each agent is a node in a fixed network and strives to be matched
to another agent. An agent has a complete preference list over all other agents
it can be matched with. Agents can match arbitrarily, and they learn about
possible partners dynamically based on their current neighborhood. We consider
convergence of dynamics to locally stable matchings -- states that are stable
with respect to their imposed information structure in the network. In the
two-sided case of stable marriage in which existence is guaranteed, we show
that the existence of a path to stability becomes NP-hard to decide. This holds
even when the network exists only among one partition of agents. In contrast,
if one partition has no network and agents remember a previous match every
round, a path to stability is guaranteed and random dynamics converge with
probability 1. We characterize this positive result in various ways. For
instance, it holds for random memory and for cache memory with the most recent
partner, but not for cache memory with the best partner. Also, it is crucial
which partition of the agents has memory. Finally, we present results for
centralized computation of locally stable matchings, i.e., computing maximum
locally stable matchings in the two-sided case and deciding existence in the
roommates case.

Baryon and Cold Dark Matter (CDM) perturbations grow anomalously for scales
within the Compton wavelength of the scalar field. In the late time Universe
when reionisation occurs, the spectrum of the 21cm brightness temperature is
thus affected. We study this effect for chameleon-f(R) models, dilatons and
symmetrons. Although the f(R) models are more tightly constrained by solar
system bounds, and effects on dilaton models are negligible, we find that
symmetrons where the phase transition occurs before z_* ~ 12 will be detectable
for a scalar field range as low as 5 kpc. For all these models, the detection
prospects of modified gravity effects are higher when considering modes
parallel to the line of sight where very small scales can be probed. The study
of the 21 cm spectrum thus offers a complementary approach to testing modified
gravity with large scale structure surveys. Short scales, which would be highly
non-linear in the very late time Universe when structure forms and where
modified gravity effects are screened, appear in the linear spectrum of 21 cm
physics, hence deviating from General Relativity in a maximal way.

addition and deletion of edges) $n$-vertex graphs using a trivial deterministic

that outperforms the na\""{\i}ve O(n) one was reported up to this date. The only
progress in this direction is due to Ivkovi\'{c} and Lloyd \cite{IL93}, who in
1993 devised a deterministic algorithm with an \emph{amortized} update time of
$O((n+m)^{\sqrt{2}/2})$, where $m$ is the number of edges.
  In this paper we show the first deterministic fully dynamic algorithm that
outperforms the trivial one. Specifically, we provide a deterministic
\emph{worst-case} update time of $O(\sqrt{m})$. Moreover, our algorithm
maintains a matching which is in fact a 3/2-approximate maximum cardinality
matching (MCM). We remark that no fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining
$(2-\eps)$-approximate MCM improving upon the na\""{\i}ve O(n) was known prior
to this work, even allowing amortized time bounds and \emph{randomization}.
  For low arboricity graphs (e.g., planar graphs and graphs excluding fixed
minors), we devise another simple deterministic algorithm with
\emph{sub-logarithmic update time}. Specifically, it maintains a fully dynamic
maximal matching with amortized update time of $O(\log n/\log \log n)$. This
result addresses an open question of Onak and Rubinfeld \cite{OR10}.
  We also show a deterministic algorithm with optimal space usage, that for
arbitrary graphs maintains a maximal matching in amortized $O(\sqrt{m})$ time,

vehicle such that the probability of satisfying a temporal logic specification
over a set of properties at the regions in a partitioned environment is
maximized. We assume that the vehicle can determine its precise initial
position in a known map of the environment. However, inspired by practical
limitations, we assume that the vehicle is equipped with noisy actuators and,
during its motion in the environment, it can only measure its angular velocity
using a limited accuracy gyroscope. Through quantization and discretization, we
construct a finite approximation for the motion of the vehicle in the form of a
Markov Decision Process (MDP). We allow for task specifications given as
temporal logic statements over the environmental properties, and use tools in
Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic (PCTL) to generate an MDP control policy
that maximizes the probability of satisfaction. We translate this policy to a
vehicle feedback control strategy and show that the probability that the
vehicle satisfies the specification in the original environment is bounded from
below by the maximum probability of satisfying the specification on the MDP.

to be very dynamical producing high density outflows at large speeds. Most of
these events represent X-ray jets from pre-existing or newly emerging coronal
bright points at X-ray temperatures. The average electron density of the jets
is logNe ~ 8.76 cm^-3 while in the flaring site it is logNe ~ 9.51 cm^-3. The
jet temperatures reach a maximum of 2.5 MK but in the majority of the cases the

a maximum of 2.5 MK though in a single event scanned a minute after the flaring

microflaring in the transition region and corona. Chromospheric emission was
only detected in their footpoints and was only associated with downflows. The
Doppler shift measurements in the quiet Sun transient brightenings confirmed
that these events do not produce jet-like phenomena. The plasma flows in these

to improve the understanding of the folding mechanism and the function of

conformations that build out the transition state is particularly cumbersome,
mainly because of the large computational cost of generating a
statistically-sound set of folding trajectories. Here we show that a biasing
algorithm, based on the physics of the ratchet-and-pawl, can be used to
identify efficiently the transition state. The basic idea is that the
algorithmic ratchet exerts a force on the protein when it is climbing the
free-energy barrier, while it is inactive when it is descending. The transition
state can be identified as the point of the trajectory where the ratchet
changes regime. Besides discussing this strategy in general terms, we test it
within a protein model whose transition state can be studied independently by
plain molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, we show its power in
explicit-solvent simulations, obtaining and characterizing a set of
transition--state conformations for ACBP and CI2.

Although solutions to these problems are intractable in general, there might be

natural and possibly efficient way to represent a POMDP is through the
predictive state representation (PSR) - a representation which recently has

automata with no increase in the representation size. Furthermore, we show that

representation and POMDPs to the well-founded multiplicity automata literature.
Based on the multiplicity automata representation, we provide a planning

these two strategies, reveals a deep connection between them, and suggests how

internal structure which defines an exponential family, whose sufficient
statistics must be matched by the parent region. Reduction operators on these

revealed that all EP approximations on discrete variables are special cases of
GBP, and conversely that some wellknown GBP approximations, such as overlapping
squares, are special cases of EP. Furthermore, region graphs derived from EP
have a number of good structural properties, including maxent-normality and
overall counting number of one. The result is a convenient framework for
producing high-quality approximations with a user-adjustable level of

a search not over the space of structures, but over the space of orderings,
selecting for each ordering the best network consistent with it. This search
space is much smaller, makes more global search steps, has a lower branching
factor, and avoids costly acyclicity checks. We present results for this

of Canuto's (2002) ideas on turbulence and waves, these balances are merged
with an (internal) gravity-wave energy balance presented for the open ocean by
Gregg (1989), without mean-flow shear. The latter was augmented by a linear
(viscous) friction term. Gregg's wave-energy source is interpreted on its
long-wave spectral end as internal tides, topography, large-scale wind, and
atmospheric low-pressure actions. In addition, internal eigen waves, generated
by mean-flow shear, and the aging of the wave field from a virginal (linear)
into a saturated state are taken into account. Wave packets and turbulence are
treated as particles (vortices, packets) by ensemble kinetics so that the loss
terms in all three balances have quadratic form. Following a proposal by Peters
(2008), the mixing efficiency of purely wave-generated turbulence is treated as
a universal constant, as well as the turbulent Prandtl number under neutral
conditions. It is shown that: (i) in the wind tunnel, eigen waves are switched
off, (ii) due to remotely generated long waves or other non-local energy
sources, coexistence equilibria of turbulence and waves are stable even at
Richardson numbers as high as $10^3$; (iii) the three-equation system is
