the maximal quantum symmetry group, whose projective representations preserve

  arXiv:1111.5033",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.str-el quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The occurrence of high-T_c superconductivity in systems including the
cuprates and the iron-based superconductors, is known to coincide with the
existence of anomalous normal-state properties which have been associated with
quantum criticality. We argue here that this observation results from the fact
that quantum criticality can allow the occurrence of very-strong-coupling
superconductivity by preventing its suppression due to competing
symmetry-breaking instabilities. Treating the electrons through a large-U
ansatz yields their separation into boson quasiparticles which are directly
involved in the formation of these instabilities, represented as their Bose
condensates, and charge-carrying fermion quasiparticles which are affected by
them indirectly. Within the critical regime, condensates corresponding to the
different broken-symmetry states are combined; consequently their negative
effect on the pairing of the fermions is strongly diminished, enabling high-T_c
superconductivity to occur. The observed phase diagram of the hole-doped
cuprates then derives from a hidden T=0 quantum phase transition between a
Fermi-liquid and a non-Fermi-liquid broken-symmetry striped state. The
pseudogap range within this diagram is found to include two distinct regimes,
with partial pairing occurring in one of them.

drug abuse and its dynamical evolution at the individual and global level. The
agents are heterogeneous with respect to their intrinsic inclination to drugs,
to their budget attitude and social environment. The various levels of drug use
were inspired by the professional description of the phenomenon and this
permits a direct comparison with all available data. We show that certain
elements have a great importance to start the use of drugs, for example the
rare events in the personal experiences which permit to overcame the barrier of
drug use occasionally. The analysis of how the system reacts to perturbations
is very important to understand its key elements and it provides strategies for
effective policy making. The present model represents the first step of a
realistic description of this phenomenon and can be easily generalized in

a utility maximizing scheduler based on loopy belief propagation is presented
that enables computationally-efficient local processing and low communication

a large class of inter-cellular interference coordination problems including
subband scheduling, dynamic orthogonalization and beamforming whenever the

relatively small sizes is developed for cDNA microarray experiments. The method
allows the main effects and interactions of successive orders to be of possibly
unequal importance. First, the approximate theory is em-ployed to get an
optimal design measure which is then discretized. It is, however, observed that
a na\""ive discretization may fail to yield an exact design of the stipulated
size and, even when it yields such an exact design, there is often scope for
improvement in efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a step-up/down
procedure which is seen to work very well. The resulting highly efficient
designs are found to remain almost free from possible dye-color effects under a
suitable dye-color assignment. They are also seen to be quite robust to
heteroscedasticity as may be caused by biological variability. We focus on the

emitted from a nearly edge-on disk with the position angle of PA = -46 deg,

rotation, the radii of the maser disk are r = 0.087--0.335 pc, and the

theory, developed for treating the physics of the t-J model. We start from the
exact Schwinger equation of motion for the Greens function for projected
electrons, and develop a systematic expansion in a parameter \lambda, relating
to the double occupancy. The resulting Greens function has a canonical part
arising from an effective Hamiltonian of the auxiliary electrons, and a
caparison part, playing the role of a frequency dependent adaptive spectral
weight. This adaptive weight balances the requirement at low \omega, of the
invariance of the Fermi volume, and at high \omega, of decaying as c_0/(i
\omega), with a correlation depleted c_0 <1. The effective Hamiltonian H_{eff}
describing the auxiliary Fermions is given a natural interpretation with an
effective interaction V_{eff} containing both the exchange J(ij), and the
hopping parameters t(ij). It is made Hermitian by adding suitable terms that
ultimately vanish, in the symmetrized theory developed in this paper. Simple
but important shift invariances of the t-J model are noted with respect to
translating its parameters uniformly. These play a crucial role in constraining
the form of V_{eff} and also provide checks for further approximations. The
auxiliary and physical Greens function satisfy two sum rules, and the Lagrange
multipliers for these are identified. A complete set of expressions for the
Greens functions to second order in \lambda is given, satisfying various
invariances. A systematic iterative procedure for higher order approximations
is detailed. A superconducting instability of the theory is noted at the
simplest level with a high transition temperature.

radiation and the different elements present in the atmosphere, which are
responsible for energy attenuation. In Colombia there have been neither
measurements nor studies of atmospheric components such as gases and aerosols
that can cause turbidity and pollution. Therefore satellite images cannot be
corrected radiometrically in a proper way. When a suitable atmospheric
correction is carried out, loss of information is avoided, which may be useful
for discriminating image land cover. In this work a computational model was
used to find radiative atmospheric attenuation (300 1000nm wavelength region)
on an equatorial tropical desert (La Tatacoa, Colombia) in order to conduct an
adequate atmospheric correction.

teams for new product development does not know which type of technology should
be used. Approach: To address the gap and answer the question, the study
presents a set of factors that make a technology construct. The proposed
construct modified by finding of the field survey (N = 240). We empirically
examine the relationship between construct and its factors by employing the
Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). A measurement model built base on the 19
preliminary factors that extracted from literature review. The result shows 10
factors out of 19 factors maintaining to make technology construct. Results:
These 10 technology factors can be grouped into two constructs namely Web base

development managers of enterprises to concentrate in the main factors for
leading an effective virtual R&D team. In addition, it provides a guideline for

the collected molecular and cold dust material along the bubbles and the
12CO(J=3-2) velocity map reveals that the molecular gas in the bubbles is
physically associated around the G8.14+0.23 region. We have detected 244 young
stellar objects (YSOs) in the region and about 37% of these YSOs occur in
clusters. Interestingly, these YSO clusters are associated with the collected
material on the edges of the bubbles. We have found good agreement between the
dynamical age of the H II region and the kinematical time scale of bubbles
(from the 12CO(J=3-2) line data) with the fragmentation time of the accumulated
molecular materials to explain possible ""collect-and-collapse"" process around
the G8.14+0.23 region. However, one can not entirely rule out the possibility
of triggered star formation by compression of the pre-existing dense clumps by
the shock wave. We have also found two massive embedded YSOs (about 10 and 22
Msolar) which are associated with the dense fragmented clump at the interface
of the bubbles. We conclude that the expansion of the H II region is also
leading to the formation of these two young massive embedded YSOs in the

First, it is posed an interaction scheme between universes whose evolution is

of the cosmological constant of one of the universes becomes very close to zero

partner universe. Second, we found normal modes for a 'chain' of interacting

finally point out that the multiverse may be much more than the mere sum of its

Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluon $g^{(2)}$ has loop-induced vertices with the standard

strong coupling of a gluon and the large Yukawa coupling of a top quark,
leading to substantial branching ratio of $Br(g^{(2)} \to t \bar{t}) \approx
7%-8%$. As the $g^{(2)}$ coupling with two gluons appears via dimension-6

Poland-Scheraga type approach, generalized to account for the fact that the
total linking number (LK), which measures the number of windings of one strand
around the other, is conserved. In the model the LK conservation is maintained
by invoking both overtwisting and writhing (supercoiling) mechanisms. This
generalizes previous studies which considered each mechanism separately. The
phase diagram of the model is analyzed as a function of the temperature and the
elastic constant $\kappa$ associated with the overtwisting energy for any given
loop entropy exponent, $c$. As is the case where the two mechanisms apply
separately, the model exhibits no denaturation transition for $c \le 2$. For
$c>2$ and $\kappa=0$ we find that the model exhibits a first order transition.
The transition becomes of higher order for any $\kappa>0$. We also calculate
the contribution of the two mechanisms separately in maintaining the
conservation of the linking number and find that it is weakly dependent on the
loop exponent $c$.

experimental technique called the Jet Counter, originally developed at the
Andrzej So{\l}tan Institute for Nuclear Studies. The Jet Counter is a unique
device in the world for studying the interaction of low energy electrons with
nanometer targets in the range 2-10 nm (in unit density). The basic
experimental result is the frequency distribution of ionization cluster size
produced by ionizing particles in a gaseous (nitrogen or propane) nanometric
track segment. The first experimental data on the frequency distribution of
ionization cluster size produced by low energy ""single"" electrons (100 eV -
2000 eV) in target cylinders of nitrogen (N2) 0.34 {\mu}g/cm2. in diameter are
presented. New experimental data on the frequency distribution of ionization
cluster size produced by 3.8 MeV {\alpha}-particles in a target cylinder of
nitrogen (N2) and propane gas (C3H8), ranging from 0.1 to 0.5 {\mu}g/cm2 in

simulations. A Bayesian analysis is applied for convoluting the measured
spectra to the true cluster size distributions. New quantities characterizing
the interaction of ionizing radiation with the nanometre level are proposed,
namely - P1, M1 and F2. It has been shown that these quantities may substitute

magnetic fields largely depends on the disposition of particle trajectories
relative to the field lines. The motion of particles with trajectories close to
the curved magnetic lines is usually referred to the so-called curvature
radiation. The latter is treated within the formalism of synchrotron radiation
by replacing the particle Larmor radius with the curvature radius of the field
lines. However, even at small pitch angles, the curvatures of the particle
trajectory and the field line may differ significantly. Moreover, as we show in
this paper the trajectory curvature varies with time, i.e. the process has a
stochastic character. Therefore for calculations of observable characteristics
of radiation by an ensemble of particles, the radiation intensities should be
averaged over time. In this paper, for determination of particle trajectories
we use the Hamiltonian formalism, and show that that close to curved magnetic
lines, for the given configuration of the magnetic field, the initial point and
particle energy, always exist a smooth trajectory without fast oscillations of
the curvature radius. This is the trajectory which is responsible for the
curvature radiation. The realization of this regime requires the initial
particle velocity to be directed strictly along the smooth trajectory. This
result might have direct relation to the recent spectral measurements of
gamma-radiation of pulsars by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.

rings centred at two locations on the sky that have recently drawn special
attention in the context of the conformal cyclic cosmology scenario proposed by
Penrose (2009). We extend this analysis to rings with larger radii and centred
on other points of the sky. Using the fast convolution technique enables us to
perform this search with higher resolution and a wider range of radii than in
previous studies. We show that for one of the two special points rings with
radii larger than 10 degrees have systematically lower variance in comparison
to the concordance LambdaCDM model predictions. However, we show that this
deviation is caused by the multipoles up to order l=7. Therefore, the deficit
of power for concentric rings with larger radii is yet another manifestation of
the well-known anomalous CMB distribution on large angular scales. Furthermore,
low variance rings can be easily found centred on other points in the sky. In
addition, we show also the results of a search for extremely high variance
rings. As for the low variance rings, some anomalies seem to be related to the
anomalous distribution of the low-order multipoles of the WMAP CMB maps. As
such our results are not consistent with the conformal cyclic cosmology
scenario.

explained the quasi-totality of its thermodynamic and transport properties, was
greeted with great circumspection, before it became the play ground of particle
physicists, who largely contributed to understand the deep physics behind this
phenomenon. In the course of this undertaking, revolutionizing new concepts in
physics were brought to light, such as (i) the ""physical significance of the
phase"" of a quantum mechanical wave function whose role in force-transmitting
gauge fields is to control the interaction between elementary particles in a
current conserving manner (ii) ""spontaneous symmetry breaking"" and its related
to it collective Nambu-Goldstone modes, which encode the basic symmetry
properties of a quantum vacuum and the associated to them conserved quatities,
(iii) The ""Anderson-Higgs mechanism"" and its associated to it, but so far
experimentally unconfirmed ""Higgs field"", which provides the introduction of
massive force transmitting gauge fields and ultimately the mass of elementary
particles. These concepts were vital in consolidating the standard model for
elementary particles and presented the final answer to what distinguishes a
superconducting from a non-superconducting state: ""electromagnetic gauge
symmetry breaking"", whatever the microscospic mechanism for that might be. We
illustrate here how these concepts gradually emerged, once the basic features,
which characterize superconductivity - the Meissner-Ochsenfeld magnetic field
screening and the fundamental London equations explaining them in a

is obtained from a (2r x r)-grid by deleting every odd vertical edge in every
odd row and every even vertical edge in every even row, then deleting the two
resulting vertices of degree one, and finally subdividing edges arbitrarily.
The vertices of degree two that existed before the subdivision are called the
pegs of the r-wall. Let G be a graph with no K_t minor, and let W be an R-wall
in G. We prove that there exist a subset A of V(G) of size at most 12288t^{24}
and an r-subwall W' of W such that V(W') is disjoint from A and W' is a flat
wall in G-A in the following sense. There exists a separation (X,Y) of G-A such
that X\cap Y is a subset of the vertex set of the cycle C' that bounds the
outer face of W', V(W') is a subset of Y, every peg of W' belongs to X and the
graph G[Y] can almost be drawn in the unit disk with the vertices X\cap Y drawn
on the boundary of the disk in the order determined by C'. Here almost means
that the assertion holds after repeatedly removing parts of the graph separated
from X\cap Y by a cutset Z of size at most three, and adding all edges with
both ends in Z. Our proof gives rise to an algorithm that runs in polynomial
time even when r and t are part of the input instance. The proof is
self-contained in the sense that it uses only results whose proofs can be found
in textbooks.

author. We extend the results published in the proceedings in two ways.
  First, we show that the data structure of power circuits can be generalized
to work with arbitrary bases q>=2. This results in a data structure that can
hold huge integers, arising by iteratively forming powers of q. We show that
the properties of power circuits known for q=2 translate to the general case.
This generalization is non-trivial and additional techniques are required to
preserve the time bounds of arithmetic operations that were shown for the case
q=2.
  The extended power circuit model permits us to conduct operations in the
Baumslag-Solitar group BS(1,q) as efficiently as in BS(1,2). This allows us to
solve the word problem in the generalization H_4(1,q) of Higman's group, which
is an amalgamated product of four copies of the Baumslag-Solitar group BS(1,q)
rather than BS(1,2) in the original form.
  As a second result, we allow arbitrary numbers f>=4 of copies of BS(1,q),
leading to an even more generalized notion of Higman groups H_f(1,q). We prove
that the word problem of the latter can still be solved within the O(n^6) time
bound that was shown for H_4(1,2).

queries are computable by constant depth (AC-0) circuits.
  Our result is almost tight in the sense that nearly n^2 counting queries can

super-polynomially many queries can be answered in exponential time.

it is impossible to construct a lattice action that implements both the O(3)
symmetry as well as at least one supersymmetry exactly at finite lattice
spacing. It is shown by explicit calculations that previously proposed
discretizations fail to reproduce the exact symmetries of the target manifold
in the continuum limit. We provide an alternative lattice action with exact
O(3) symmetry and compare two approaches based on different derivative
operators. Using the nonlocal SLAC derivative for the quenched model on
moderately sized lattices we extract the value {\sigma}(2, u_0) = 1.2604(13)
for the step scaling function at u_0 = 1.0595, to be compared with the exact
value 1.261210. For the supersymmetric model with SLAC derivative the discrete
chiral symmetry is maintained but we encounter strong sign fluctuations,
rendering large lattice simulations ineffective. By applying the Wilson
prescription, supersymmetry and chiral symmetry are broken explicitly at finite
lattice spacing, though there is clear evidence that both are restored in the
continuum limit by fine tuning of a single mass parameter.

break parity invariance. Our analysis shows that (M-N) is related to the

attention in the ecological literature, leading to a proliferation of methods,
including the inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP) model, maximum entropy
(Maxent) modeling of species distributions and logistic regression models.
Several recent articles have shown the close relationships between these
methods. We explain why the IPP intensity function is a more natural object of
inference in presence-only studies than occurrence probability (which is only
defined with reference to quadrat size), and why presence-only data only allows
estimation of relative, and not absolute intensity of species occurrence. All
three of the above techniques amount to parametric density estimation under the
same exponential family model (in the case of the IPP, the fitted density is
multiplied by the number of presence records to obtain a fitted intensity). We
show that IPP and Maxent give the exact same estimate for this density, but
logistic regression in general yields a different estimate in finite samples.
When the model is misspecified - as it practically always is - logistic
regression and the IPP may have substantially different asymptotic limits with
large data sets. We propose ``infinitely weighted logistic regression,'' which
is exactly equivalent to the IPP in finite samples. Consequently, many
already-implemented methods extending logistic regression can also extend the
Maxent and IPP models in directly analogous ways using this technique.

to determine the near-horizon spacetime, while for the null case (an isolated

  The formalism is demonstrated for two applications. First, spacetime is
considered near an isolated horizon and the construction is both checked
against the Kerr-Newman solution and compared to the well-known near-horizon
limit for stationary extremal black hole spacetimes. Second, spacetime is
examined in the vicinity of a slowly evolving horizon and it is demonstrated
that there is always an event horizon candidate in this region. The geometry
and other properties of this null surface match those of the slowly evolving
horizon to leading order and in this approximation the candidate evolves in a

experiments made that time at nuclear reactors. On base of the positron
spectrum the standard antineutrino spectrum for typical reactor fuel
composition was restored. In presented analysis the partial spectra forming
this standard spectrum were extracted using specific method. They could be used

radiative energy transport at the base of the convective envelope of the
solar-like oscillator HD 52265 recently observed by the CoRoT satellite.
Methods: We investigated the origin of one specific feature found in the HD
52265 frequency spectrum. We modelled the star to derive the internal structure
and the oscillation frequencies that best match the observations and used a
seismic indicator sensitive to the properties of the base of the envelope
convection zone. Results: The seismic indicators clearly reveal that to best
represent the observed properties of HD 52265, models must include penetrative
convection below the outer convective envelope. The penetrative distance is
estimated to be $\sim0.95 H_P$, which corresponds to an extent over a distance
representing 6.0 per cents of the total stellar radius, significantly larger
than what is found for the Sun. The inner boundary of the extra-mixing region
is found at $0.800\pm0.004 R$ where $R=1.3 R_\odot$ is the stellar radius.
Conclusions: These results contribute to the tachocline characterization in
stars other than the Sun.

asks, for an interval graph with some intervals pre-drawn by the input, whether
the partial representation can be extended to a representation of the entire
graph. In this paper, we give a linear-time algorithm for extending proper
interval representations and an almost quadratic-time algorithm for extending
unit interval representations.
  We also introduce the more general problem of bounded representations of unit
interval graphs, where the input constrains the positions of some intervals by
lower and upper bounds. We show that this problem is NP-complete for
disconnected input graphs and give a polynomial-time algorithm for the special
class of instances, where the ordering of the connected components of the input
graph along the real line is prescribed. This includes the case of partial
representation extension.
  The hardness result sharply contrasts the recent polynomial-time algorithm
for bounded representations of proper interval graphs [Balko et al. ISAAC'13].
So unless $\text{P} = \text{NP}$, proper and unit interval representations have
vastly different structure. This explains why partial representation extension
problems for these different types of representations require substantially
different techniques.

affect the large-scale structure of the genome. These changes include gene
gain, loss, duplication, chromosome fusion, fission, and rearrangement. When
gene gain and loss occurs in addition to other types of rearrangement,
breakpoints of rearrangement can exist that are only detectable by comparison
of three or more genomes. An arbitrarily large number of these ""hidden""
breakpoints can exist among genomes that exhibit no rearrangements in pairwise
comparisons.
  We present an extension of the multichromosomal breakpoint median problem to
genomes that have undergone gene gain and loss. We then demonstrate that the
median distance among three genomes can be used to calculate a lower bound on
the number of hidden breakpoints present. We provide an implementation of this
calculation including the median distance, along with some practical
improvements on the time complexity of the underlying algorithm.
  We apply our approach to measure the abundance of hidden breakpoints in
simulated data sets under a wide range of evolutionary scenarios. We
demonstrate that in simulations the hidden breakpoint counts depend strongly on
relative rates of inversion and gene gain/loss. Finally we apply current
multiple genome aligners to the simulated genomes, and show that all aligners
introduce a high degree of error in hidden breakpoint counts, and that this
error grows with evolutionary distance in the simulation. Our results suggest
that hidden breakpoint error may be pervasive in genome alignments.

the Rossiter-McLaughlin (R-M) effect. Our analyses show that the R-M effect for
a binary planet or exomoon during its complete transit phase can be divided
into two parts. The first is the conventional one similar to the R-M effect
from the transit of a single planet, of which the mass and the projected area
are the combinations of the binary components; and the second is caused by the
orbital rotation of the binary components, which may add a sine- or linear-mode
deviation to the stellar radial velocity curve. We find that the latter effect
can be up to several or several ten m/s. By doing numerical simulations as well
as analytical analyses, we illustrate that the distribution and dispersion of
the latter effects obtained from multiple transit events can be used to
constrain the dynamical configuration of the binary planet, such as, how the
inner orbit of the binary planet is inclined to its orbit rotating around the
central star. We find that the signatures caused by the orbital rotation of the
binary components are more likely to be revealed if the two components of
binary planet have different masses and mass densities, especially if the heavy
one has a high mass density and the light one has a low density. Similar
signature on the R-M effect may also be revealed in a hierarchical triple star
system containing a dark compact binary and a tertiary star.

presented from detailed studies of the period and light variations, based on
the historical data and our new observations. All available light curves
display total eclipses at secondary minima and inverse O'Connell effects with
Max I fainter than Max II, which are satisfactorily modeled by adding the
slightly time-varying hot spot on the primary star. A total of 87 times of
minimum light spanning over about 74 yrs, including our 22 timing measurements,
were used for ephemeris computations. Detailed analysis of the O-C diagram
showed that the orbital period has changed in combinations with an upward
parabola and a sinusoidal variation. The continuous period increase with a rate
of +5.65 \times 10^-7 d yr^-1 is consistent with that calculated from the
Wilson-Devinney synthesis code. It can be interpreted as a mass transfer from
the secondary to the primary star at a rate of 2.74 \times 10^-7 M\odot yr^-1,
which is one of the largest rates for contact systems. The most likely
explanation of the sinusoidal variation with a period of 30.2 yrs and a
semi-amplitude of 0.0062 d is a light-traveltime effect due to the existence of
a circumbinary object. We suggest that BX Dra is probably a triple system,
consisting of a primary star with a spectral type of F0, its secondary
component of spectral type F1-2, and an unseen circumbinary object with a
minimum mass of M3 = 0.23 M\odot.

remanence and coercivity of a kinetic Ising model in the presence of quenched
bond dilution are investigated in detail. The kinetic equation describing the
time dependence of the magnetization is derived by means of effective-field
theory with single-site correlations. It is found that the frequency
dispersions of hysteresis loop area, remanence and coercivity strongly depend
on the quenched bond randomness, as well as applied field amplitude and
oscillation frequency. In addition, the shape of the hysteresis curves for a
wide variety of Hamiltonian parameters is studied and some interesting
behaviors are found. Finally, a comparison of our observations with those of
recently published studies is represented and it is shown that there exists a
qualitatively good agreement.

cluster member candidates in ~56 square degrees in \APer{} by combining
photometry in five near-infrared passbands and proper motions derived from the
multiple epochs provided by the UKIDSS GCS DR9. We also provide revised
membership for all previously published APer low-mass stars and brown dwarfs
recovered in GCS based on the new photometry and astrometry provided by DR9. We
find no evidence of $K$-band variability in members of APer with dispersion
less than 0.06-0.09 mag. We employed two independent but complementary methods
to derive the cluster luminosity and mass functions: a probabilistic analysis
and a more standard approach consisting of stricter astrometric and photometric
cuts. We find that the resulting luminosity and mass functions obtained from
both methods are consistent. We find that the shape of the APer mass function
is similar to that of the Pleiades although the characteristic mass may be
higher after including higher mass data from earlier studies (the dispersion is
comparable). We conclude that the mass functions of APer, the Pleiades, and
Praesepe are best reproduced by a log-normal representation similar to the
system field mass function although with some variation in the characteristic
mass and dispersion values.

incorporating an artificial heat conductivity term in which the adopted signal
velocity is applicable when gravity is present. In accordance with previous
findings it is shown that the performances of SPH to describe the development
of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities depend strongly on the consistency of the
initial condition set-up and on the leading error in the momentum equation due
to incomplete kernel sampling. An error and stability analysis shows that the
quartic B-spline kernel (M_5) possesses very good stability properties and we
propose its use with a large neighbor number, between ~50 (2D) to ~ 100 (3D),
to improve convergence in simulation results without being affected by the
so-called clumping instability. SPH simulations of the blob test show that in
the regime of strong supersonic flows an appropriate limiting condition, which
depends on the Prandtl number, must be imposed on the artificial conductivity
SPH coefficients in order to avoid an unphysical amount of heat diffusion.
Results from hydrodynamic simulations that include self-gravity show profiles
of hydrodynamic variables that are in much better agreement with those produced
using mesh-based codes. In particular, the final levels of core entropies in
cosmological simulations of galaxy clusters are consistent with those found
using AMR codes. Finally, results of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability test
demonstrate that in the regime of very subsonic flows the code has still
several difficulties in the treatment of hydrodynamic instabilities. These
problems being intrinsically due to the way in which in standard SPH gradients
are calculated and not to the implementation of the artificial conductivity
term.

production cross section and decay widths of a light CP-even Higgs boson. For
simplicity, we consider scenarios in which only one of the sfermions from the
third generation is light. For each case, we attempt to explain the apparently
large enhancement in the Higgs production and decay in the diphoton channel
with small deviations in the ZZ channel. In the MSSM framework we find that
only a light stau can explain these observations while keeping the lightest
CP-even Higgs boson mass in the interval 123 GeV \lesssim m_h \lesssim 127 GeV.
For the light stop scenario, the observations related to the diphoton and ZZ
channel can be accommodated but, in order to satisfy the Higgs mass bound, one
needs to go beyond the MSSM. In particular, we invoke vector like particles
with masses around a TeV. These new particles preserve gauge coupling
unification and provide additional contributions to the Higgs mass. With these
new contributions a 126 GeV Higgs mass is easily achieved. We also find that
with only a light sbottom quark, the above mentioned excess is hard to
accommodate.

It is found that the resulting universe model maintains its anisotropic nature

shear scalars. The physical implications of this model are discussed by using
different parameters and their graphs. We conclude that this model corresponds
to an accelerated expanding universe for particular values of the parameters.

choosing an exponential potential and cosmologically viable form of F(T). We
found that the dynamical system of equations admits two unstable critical
points; thus no attractor solutions exist in this cosmology. Furthermore,
taking into account the scalar field mimicking quintessence and phantom energy,
we discuss the corresponding cosmic evolution for both small and large times.
We investigate the cosmological implications of the model via the equation of
state and deceleration parameters of our model and show that the late-time
Universe will be dominated by phantom energy and, moreover, phantom crossing is
possible. Our results do not lead to explicit predictions for inflation and the
early Universe era.
