and Ellis-Jaffe sum rules is derived in the conformal invariant limit of
massless U(1) theory, namely in the perturbative quenched QED model, and in the
same limit of the massless $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory with fermions. The derivation
is based on the comparison of results of application of the operator product
expansion approach to the dressed triangle Green functions of singlet Axial
vector- Vector-Vector and non-singlet Axial vector-Vector-Vector fermion
currents in the limit, when the conformal symmetry is not violated. The
expressions for the $O(\alpha_s^3)$ approximation of the non-singlet
coefficient function, derived in the conformal invariant limit of $SU(N_c)$
group, is reminded. Its possible application in the phenomenological analysis
of the experimental data for the Bjorken polarized sum rule is outlined.

orders of magnitude. This work illuminates and conquers the theoretical
challenges that stand in the way of combining the power of these techniques.
The challenge in marrying these techniques is not subtle: computing the
reachable control states of a pushdown system relies on limiting access during
transition to the top of the stack; abstract garbage collection, on the other
hand, needs full access to the entire stack to compute a root set, just as
concrete collection does. \emph{Introspective} pushdown systems resolve this
conflict. Introspective pushdown systems provide enough access to the stack to
allow abstract garbage collection, but they remain restricted enough to compute
control-state reachability, thereby enabling the sound and precise product of
pushdown analysis and abstract garbage collection. Experiments reveal
synergistic interplay between the techniques, and the fusion demonstrates
""better-than-both-worlds"" precision.

ejection activity of their central stars is still poorly understood.
Appropriately characterizing the evolution of the shells ejected during the
late stages of evolution is vital to gain insight into the mechanism of nebular
shaping.
  Herschel/HIFI provides an invaluable tool by opening a new window from which
to probe warm molecular gas (~50-1000 K). We present a radiative-transfer,
spatio-kinematic modeling of the molecular envelope of the young planetary
nebula NGC 7027 in high- and low-J 12CO and 13CO transitions observed by
Herschel/HIFI and IRAM 30-m, and discuss the structure and dynamics of the
molecular envelope.
  We have developed a code which, used along with the existing SHAPE software,
implements spatio-kinematic modeling with accurate non-LTE calculations of line
excitation and radiative transfer in molecular species. We have used this code
to build a relatively simple ""russian doll"" model of the molecular envelope of
NGC 7027.
  The model nebula consists of four nested, mildly bipolar shells plus a pair
of high-velocity blobs. The innermost shell is the thinnest and shows a
significant jump in physical conditions (temperature, density, abundance and
velocity) with respect to the adjacent shell. This is a clear indication of a
shock front in the system. Each of the high-velocity blobs is divided into two
sections with different physical conditions. The presence of H2O in NGC 7027, a
C-rich nebula, is likely due to photo-induced chemistry from the hot central
star. The computed molecular mass of the nebula is 1.3 Msun, compatible with
estimates from previous works.

modes of quantum fields in non-uniformly moving cavities. The transformations
generated by the cavity motion can be considered as multipartite quantum gates.
We present two setups for which multi-mode entanglement can be generated for
bosons and fermions. As a highlight we show that the bosonic genuine
multipartite correlations can be resonantly enhanced. Our results provide
fundamental insights into the structure of Bogoliubov transformations and
suggest strong links between quantum information, quantum fields in curved
spacetimes and gravitational analogs by way of the equivalence principle.

microelectronics and its eventual transition to nanoelectronics. As it is well
known, there is a continuous exponential tendency of microelectronics towards
miniaturization summarized in G. Moore's empirical law. There is consensus that
the corresponding decrease in size must end in 10 to 15 years due to physical
as well as economical limits. It is thus necessary to prepare new solutions if
one wants to pursue this trend further. One approach is to start from the
ultimate limit, i.e. the atomic level, and design new materials and components
which will replace the present day MOS (metal-oxide-semi- conductor) based
technology. This is exactly the essence of nanotechnology, i.e. the ability to
work at the molecular level, atom by atom or molecule by molecule, to create
larger structures with fundamentally new molecular orga- nization. This should
lead to novel materials with improved physical, chemi- cal and biological
properties. These properties can be exploited in new devices. Such a goal would
have been thought out of reach 15 years ago but the advent of new tools and new
fabrication methods have boosted the field. We want to give here an overview of
two different subfields of nano- electronics. The first part is centered on
inorganic materials and describes two aspects: i) the physical and economical
limits of the tendency to miniaturiza- tion; ii) some attempts which have
already been made to realize devices with nanometric size. The second part
deals with molecular electronics, where the basic quantities are now molecules,
which might offer new and quite interest- ing possibilities for the future of
nanoelectronics

that achieves constant degree, diameter $O(\log n)$, and weight $O(\log^2 n)
\cdot \omega(MST)$, and has running time $O(n \cdot \log n)$. This construction
applies to $n$-point constant-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Moreover, Arya et
al. conjectured that the weight bound can be improved by a logarithmic factor,
without increasing the degree and the diameter of the spanner, and within the
same running time.
  This conjecture of Arya et al. became a central open problem in the area of
Euclidean spanners.
  In this paper we resolve the long-standing conjecture of Arya et al. in the
affirmative. Specifically, we present a construction of spanners with the same
stretch, degree, diameter, and running time, as in Arya et al.'s result, but
with optimal weight $O(\log n) \cdot \omega(MST)$.
  Moreover, our result is more general in three ways. First, we demonstrate
that the conjecture holds true not only in constant-dimensional Euclidean
spaces, but also in doubling metrics. Second, we provide a general tradeoff
between the three involved parameters, which is tight in the entire range.
Third, we devise a transformation that decreases the lightness of spanners in
general metrics, while keeping all their other parameters in check. Our main
result is obtained as a corollary of this transformation.

not guaranteed to find a (dis)proof of minimal cost on every input.

Although the origin of the inverted Hanle effect has been thought to be

finding is inconsistent with the conventional interpretation. More importantly,
we report that there were two different Hanle signals in a non-local 3-terminal

ascribed to spin transport. These results strongly suggest that (1) there is
room for discussion concerning the origin of the inverted Hanle effect, and (2)

$m_{1/2}$ can lie in the sub-TeV region, $A_0/m_0$ is mostly confined to a
narrow strip with $|A_0/m_0| \leq 1$, while $m_0$ is typically a TeV or larger.
Further, the Bayesian analysis is used to set 95% CL lower bounds on sparticle
masses. Additionally, it is shown that the spin independent neutralino-proton
cross section lies just beyond the reach of the current sensitivity but within
the projected sensitivity of the SuperCDMS-1T and XENON-1T experiments, which
explains why dark matter has thus far not been detected. The light sparticle

abstract tasks suffice to solve problems in a wide variety of settings.
Furthermore, the techniques described in this thesis can be extended to provide
a wide range of additional tests beyond the ones described here.
  A variety of applications for these methods are examined in detail. These
applications are drawn from the area of text analysis and genetic sequence
analysis. The textually oriented tasks include finding interesting collocations
and cooccurent phrases, language identification, and information retrieval. The
biologically oriented tasks include species identification and the discovery of
previously unreported long range structure in genes. In the applications
reported here where direct comparison is possible, the performance of these new
methods substantially exceeds the state of the art.
  Overall, the methods described here provide new and effective ways to analyse

league, based on a simple dynamics that mimics a soccer tournament. In our
model, a team is created with a defined potential(ability) which is updated
during the tournament according to the results of previous games. The updated
potential modifies a teams' future winning/losing probabilities. We show that
this evolutionary game is able to reproduce the statistical properties of final
standings of actual editions of the Brazilian tournament (Brasileir\~{a}o).
However, other leagues such as the Italian and the Spanish tournaments have
notoriously non-Gaussian traces and cannot be straightforwardly reproduced by
this evolutionary non-Markovian model. A complete understanding of these
phenomena deserves much more attention, but we suggest a simple explanation
based on data collected in Brazil: Here several teams were crowned champion in
previous editions corroborating that the champion typically emerges from random
fluctuations that partly preserves the gaussian traces during the tournament.
On the other hand, in the Italian and Spanish leagues only a few teams in
recent history have won their league tournaments. These leagues are based on
more robust and hierarchical structures established even before the beginning
of the tournament. For the sake of completeness, we also elaborate a totally
Gaussian model (which equalizes the winning, drawing, and losing probabilities)
and we show that the scores of the ""Brasileir\~{a}o"" cannot be reproduced. Such
aspects stress that evolutionary aspects are not superfluous in our modeling.
Finally, we analyse the distortions of our model in situations where a large
number of teams is considered, showing the existence of a transition from a
single to a double peaked histogram of the final classification scores. An
interesting scaling is presented for different sized tournaments.

demonstrate that left-handed metamaterials can significantly suppress
localization of light and lead to an anomalously enhanced transmission. This
suppression is essential at the long-wavelength limit in the case of normal
incidence, at specific angles of oblique incidence (Brewster anomaly), and in
the vicinity of the zero-epsilon or zero-mu frequencies for dispersive
metamaterials. Remarkably, in disordered samples comprised of alternating
normal and left-handed metamaterials, the reciprocal Lyapunov exponent and
reciprocal transmittance increment can differ from each other. Second, we study
magneto-active multilayered structures, which exhibit nonreciprocal
localization of light depending on the direction of propagation and on the
polarization. At resonant frequencies or realizations, such nonreciprocity
results in effectively unidirectional transport of light. Third, we discuss the
analogy between the wave propagation through multilayered samples with
metamaterials and the charge transport in graphene, which enables a simple
physical explanation of unusual conductive properties of disordered graphene
superlatices. We predict disorder-induced resonances of the transmission
coefficient at oblique incidence of the Dirac quasiparticles. Finally, we
demonstrate that an interplay of nonlinearity and disorder in dielectric media
can lead to bistability of individual localized states excited inside the
medium at resonant frequencies. This results in nonreciprocity of the wave
transmission and unidirectional transport of light.

evolution in single neurons can be measured at high frequency, but biophysical
realistic models have to include the unobserved dynamics of ion channels. One
such model is the stochastic Morris-Lecar model, defined by a nonlinear
two-dimensional stochastic differential equation. The coordinates are coupled,
that is, the unobserved coordinate is nonautonomous, the model exhibits
oscillations to mimic the spiking behavior, which means it is not of
gradient-type, and the measurement noise from intracellular recordings is
typically negligible. Therefore, the hidden Markov model framework is
degenerate, and available methods break down. The main contributions of this
paper are an approach to estimate in this ill-posed situation and nonasymptotic
convergence results for the method. Specifically, we propose a sequential Monte
Carlo particle filter algorithm to impute the unobserved coordinate, and then
estimate parameters maximizing a pseudo-likelihood through a stochastic version
of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It turns out that even the rate
scaling parameter governing the opening and closing of ion channels of the

Outreach activities can help in promoting the concept of space weather. In
particular the visual beauty and excitement of the aurora make these lights a
wonderful inspirational hook. A century ago Norwegian experimental physicist
Kristian Birkeland, one of the founding fathers of modern space science,
demonstrated with his Terrella experiment the formation of the aurora. Recently
a modernised version of the Terrella has been designed. This Planeterrella
experiment is very flexible, allowing the visualization of many phenomena
occurring in our space environment. Although the Planeterrella was originally
designed to be small to be demonstrated locally by a scientist, the
Planeterrella has proved to be a very successful public outreach experiment. We
believe that its success is due to two main factors (i) the Planeterrella is
not patented and the plans are given freely to any public institution and (ii)
the advertisement does not rely on press release, books or web sites but mainly
on National and European scientific networks such as COST ES 0803. Today, nine
Planeterrellas are operating or under construction in four different countries,
and more are in the pipleline. In five years, about 50,000 people in Europe
have been able to see live demonstrations of the formation of auroral lights,
picture the space environment and get an introduction to space weather with
this experiment. Many more have seen the Planeterrella demonstrated on TV

by capillary forces. In systems with comparable pore length and diameter, such
as paper and sand, the front of the propagating liquid forms a continuous
interface. Sections of this interface advance in a highly correlated manner due
to an effective surface tension, which restricts front broadening. Here we
investigate water imbibition in a nanoporous glass (Vycor) in which the pores
are much longer than they are wide. In this case, no continuous liquid-vapor
interface with coalesced menisci can form. Anomalously fast imbibition front
roughening is experimentally observed by neutron imaging.We propose a
theoretical pore network model, whose structural details are adapted to the
microscopic pore structure of Vycor glass, and show that it displays the same
large scale roughening characteristics as observed in the experiment. The model
predicts that menisci movements are uncorrelated. This indicates that despite
the connectivity of the network the smoothening effect of surface tension on
the imbibition front roughening is negligible. These results suggest a new
universality class of imbibition behavior which is expected to occur in any
matrix with elongated, interconnected pores of random radii.

identification of stops which decay predominantly into a top quark and the
stable lightest supersymmetric particle. We use a simple kinematical variable,
$M3$, to reconstruct two top quarks which are pair-produced from the stops, in
the fully hadronic channel. The dominant Standard Model (SM) background for
this signal stems from $t\bar t$ plus jets, with one top quark decaying into $
bl\nu$, where the lepton is undetected and the $\nu$ produces missing
transverse momentum. The lepton identification efficiency is thus crucial in
order to estimate the background correctly. We identify kinematical variables
to reduce the SM background. We find that it is possible to achieve signal and

GeV for a neutralino mass of 100 GeV.

the kay factor insuring (by conjecture of Cook) the generation of endless

60 years ago, the individuals (claims, propositions, lemmas, conjectures,

evolves extremely slowly. We show that all theorems in LCT have descended from
some common primitive propositions such as ""every complete graph is

improvements, modifications and three kinds of generalizations - closing,
associating and extending. It is reasonable to review Darwinian mechanisms in

new challenges of virtual network embedding in wireless multi-hop networks, and
propose a new embedding algorithm that efficiently uses the resources of the
physical substrate network. We examine our algorithm's performance through
extensive simulations under various scenarios. Due to lack of competitive
algorithms, we compare the proposed algorithm to five other algorithms, mainly
borrowed from wired embedding or artificially made by us, partially with or
