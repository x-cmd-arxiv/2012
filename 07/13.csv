so far prohibited simulations of the cold and dense regime. Here we study the
onset of nuclear matter employing a three-dimensional effective theory derived
by combined strong coupling and hopping expansions, which is valid for heavy
but dynamical quarks and has a mild sign problem only. Its numerical
evaluations agree between a standard Metropolis and complex Langevin algorithm,
where the latter is free of the sign problem. Our continuum extrapolated data
clearly show a first order phase transition building up at $\mu_B \approx m_B$
as the temperature approaches zero. An excellent description of the data is
achieved by an analytic solution in the strong coupling limit.

metal oxides is introduced and explained on several examples. It is shown that
spin-orbital entanglement in superexchange models destabilizes the long-range
(spin and orbital) order and may lead either to a disordered spin-liquid state
or to novel phases at low temperature which arise from strongly frustrated
interactions. Such novel ground states cannot be described within the
conventionally used mean field theory which separates spin and orbital degrees
of freedom. Even in cases where the ground states are disentangled,
spin-orbital entanglement occurs in excited states and may become crucial for a
correct description of physical properties at finite temperature. As an
important example of this behaviour we present spin-orbital entanglement in the
$R$VO$_3$ perovskites, with $R$=La,Pr,...,Yb,Lu, where such finite temperature
properties of these compounds can be understood only using entangled states:
($i$) thermal evolution of the optical spectral weights, ($ii$) the dependence
of transition temperatures for the onset of orbital and magnetic order on the
ionic radius in the phase diagram of the $R$VO$_3$ perovskites, and ($iii$)
dimerization observed in the magnon spectra for the $C$-type antiferromagnetic
phase of YVO$_3$. Finally, it is shown that joint spin-orbital excitations in
an ordered phase with coexisting antiferromagnetic and alternating orbital
order introduces topological constraints for the hole propagation and will thus
radically modify transport properties in doped Mott insulators where hole
motion implies simultaneous spin and orbital excitations.

practical methods for non-destructive measurements on optical fields is
therefore an important topic for future practical quantum information

$S$ given $T$ queries to a stochastic first order oracle. We argue that the
complexity of convex minimization is only determined by the rate of growth of
the function around its minimizer $x^*_{f,S}$, as quantified by a Tsybakov-like
noise condition. Specifically, we prove that if $f$ grows at least as fast as
$\|x-x^*_{f,S}\|^\kappa$ around its minimum, for some $\kappa > 1$, then the
optimal rate of learning $f(x^*_{f,S})$ is
$\Theta(T^{-\frac{\kappa}{2\kappa-2}})$. The classic rate $\Theta(1/\sqrt T)$
for convex functions and $\Theta(1/T)$ for strongly convex functions are
special cases of our result for $\kappa \rightarrow \infty$ and $\kappa=2$, and
even faster rates are attained for $\kappa <2$. We also derive tight bounds for
the complexity of learning $x_{f,S}^*$, where the optimal rate is
$\Theta(T^{-\frac{1}{2\kappa-2}})$. Interestingly, these precise rates for
convex optimization also characterize the complexity of active learning and our
results further strengthen the connections between the two fields, both of
which rely on feedback-driven queries.

the ability to manipulate the coupling by applying strain may lead to

limits of communications in interference networks is established. Here,
interference network is referred to as a general single-hop communication
scenario with arbitrary number of transmitters and receivers, and also
arbitrary distribution of messages among transmitters and receivers. It is
shown that the information flow in such networks follows similar derivations
from many aspects. This systematic study is launched by considering the basic
building blocks in Part I. The Multiple Access Channel (MAC), the Broadcast
Channel (BC), the Classical Interference Channel (CIC) and the Cognitive Radio
Channel (CRC) are proposed as the main building blocks for all interference
networks. First, a brief review of existing results regarding these basic
structures is presented. New observations are also presented in this regard.
Specifically, it is shown that the well-known strong interference conditions
for the two-user CIC do not change if the inputs are dependent. Next, new
capacity outer bounds are established for the basic structures with two
receivers. These outer bounds are all derived based on a unified framework. By
using the derived outer bounds, some new capacity results are proved for the
CIC and the CRC; a mixed interference regime is identified for the two-user
discrete CIC where the sum-rate capacity is established. Also, a noisy
interference regime is derived for the one-sided discrete CIC. For the CRC, a
full characterization of the capacity region for a class of more-capable
channels is obtained. Moreover, it is shown that the derived outer bounds are
useful to study the channels with one-sided receiver side information wherein
one of the receivers has access to the non-intended message; capacity bounds
are also discussed in details for such scenarios.

of the radio halo of the Coma cluster with the gamma-ray upper limits obtained
by the Fermi-LAT and with the magnetic field strength derived from Faraday
rotation measures (RM). We explore the possibility that the radio halo is due
to synchrotron emission of secondary electrons generated via p-p collisions in
the intra-cluster-medium (ICM). First we investigate the case of pure secondary
models. We use the observed spatial distribution of the halo's radio brightness
to constrain the amount of cosmic rays (CRs) and their spatial distribution in
the cluster that are required by the model. Under the canonical assumption that
the spectrum of CRs is a power-law in momentum and that the spectrum of
secondaries is stationary, we find that the combination of the steep spectrum
of CRs necessary to explain the spectrum of the halo and their very broad
spatial distribution (and large energy density) result in a gamma-ray emission
in excess of present limits, unless the cluster magnetic field is sufficiently
large. However such a field appears inconsistent with constraints from RM.
Second we investigate more complex models based on secondary particles in which
CR protons and their secondaries are all reaccelerated by MHD turbulence. We
show that under these conditions it is possible to reproduce the radio data and
to predict gamma-rays in agreement with the Fermi-LAT limits without tension
with constraints on the cluster magnetic field. Reacceleration of secondaries

functions. However, they should resemble the smoothness of the corresponding
real solutions in one way or another. In two of our recent papers, a kind of
spacial smoothness indicators was defined and subsequently applied on the {\it
a posteriori} error analysis. Here we prove that the boundedness of those
smoothness indicators is actually a necessary condition for a piecewise
polynomial function to approximate a smooth function with optimal convergence
rate. This should help in validating the error analysis in the related papers.
Moreover, the result of this paper provides an efficient practical method to
detect the loss of convergence rate due to the lack of numerical smoothness,
hence it serves as a criterion for the qualities of many numerical schemes.

  Information Flow in Degraded Networks","A table of contents is given",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this second part of our multi-part papers, the information flow in
degraded interference networks is studied. A full characterization of the
sum-rate capacity for the degraded networks with any possible configuration is
established. It is shown that a successive decoding scheme is sum-rate optimal
for these networks. Also, it is proved that the transmission of only a certain
subset of messages is sufficient to achieve the sum-rate capacity in such
networks. Algorithms are presented to determine this subset of messages
explicitly. According to these algorithms, the optimal strategy to achieve the
sum-rate capacity in degraded networks is that the transmitters try to send
information for the stronger receivers and, if possible, avoid sending the
messages with respect to the weaker receivers. The algorithms are easily
understood using our graphical illustrations for the achievability schemes
based on directed graphs. The sum-rate expression for the degraded networks is
then used to derive a unified outer bound on the sum-rate capacity of arbitrary
non-degraded networks. Several variations of the degraded networks are
identified for which the derived outer bound is sum-rate optimal. Specifically,
noisy interference regimes are derived for certain classes of
multi-user/multi-message interference networks. Also, for the first time,
network scenarios are identified where the incorporation of both successive
decoding and treating interference as noise achieves their sum-rate capacity.
Finally, by taking insight from our results for degraded networks, we establish
a unified outer bound on the entire capacity region of the general interference
networks. These outer bounds for a broad range of network scenarios are tighter
than the existing cut-set bound.

networks with strong interference. First, the two-receiver networks are

established. It is shown that this outer bound can be systematically translated
into simple capacity outer bounds for special cases such as the two-user
Classical Interference Channel (CIC) and the Broadcast Channel with Cognitive
Relays (BCCR) with common information. For these channels, special cases are
presented where our outer bounds are tight, which yield the exact capacity.
More importantly, by using the derived outer bounds, a strong interference
regime is identified for the general two-receiver interference networks with
any arbitrary topology. This strong interference regime, which is represented
by only two conditions, includes all previously known results for simple
topologies such as the two-user CIC, the cognitive radio channel, and many
others. Then, networks with arbitrary number of receivers are considered.
Finding non-trivial strong interference regime for such networks, specifically
for the CICs with more than two users, has been one of the open problems in
network information theory. In this paper, we will give a solution to this
problem. Specifically, a new approach is developed based on which one can
obtain strong interference regimes not only for the multi-user CICs but also
for any interference network of arbitrary large sizes. For this development,
some new technical lemmas are proved which have a central role in the
derivations. As a result, this paper establishes the first non-trivial capacity
result for the multi-user classical interference channel. A general formula is
also presented to derive strong interference conditions for any given network
topology.

perform quantum teleportation by presenting several protocols in many different

single formalism the three major strategies known to date that allow one to use
partially entangled states for direct quantum teleportation (no distillation
strategies permitted) and compare their efficiencies in real world
implementations. We show how one can improve the efficiency of many direct
teleportation protocols by combining these techniques. We then develop new
teleportation protocols employing multipartite partially entangled states. The
three techniques are also used here in order to achieve the highest efficiency
possible. Finally, we prove the upper bound for the optimal success rate for
protocols based on partially entangled Bell states and show that some of the

between apsidal and libration periods lying within first-order mean motion
resonances [mmr] in the solar system. At the 4/3 and 3/2 mmr in the asteroid
belt, we find in general that it is possible to identify the positions of their
considerably large number and to determine the degree of chaos that they
develop. The severity of the latter corresponds to the absence of observed
asteroids at low eccentricity, e, in both of these mmr and even more so at 2/1.
Chaos at higher e is present but weaker so that real bodies can remain over the
age of the solar system. This reduced chaos, we suggest, arises because the
denser though weaker secondaries have widths that allow them to overlap and so
provide a continuous quite constant level of chaos over a broad eccentricity
range. We also consider the similar first-order 1/2 mmr with Neptune in the
Kuiper belt at 47.8 AU and find considerable chaos, probably once again induced
by secondary resonances, among the many orbits with e < 0.10. The instability
so generated seems very likely to correspond in realistic models to the slow
escape from 1/2 of a fair number of its once captured bodies over the solar
system's age.

network with two receivers, splitting messages into more than two sub-messages
in a random coding scheme is redundant. To this end, the Broadcast Channel with
Cognitive Relays (BCCR) is considered. A novel achievability scheme is designed
for this network. Our achievability design is derived by a systematic
combination of the best known achievability schemes for the basic building
blocks included in the network: the Han-Kobayashi scheme for the two-user
interference channel and the Marton coding scheme for the broadcast channel.
Meanwhile, in our scheme each private message is split into only two
sub-messages which is identically exploited also in the Han-Kobayashi scheme.
It is shown that the resultant achievable rate region includes previous results
as well. More importantly, the procedure of the achievability design is
described by graphical illustrations based on directed graphs. Then, it is
argued that by extending the proposed scheme on the MACCM plan of messages, one
can derive similar achievability schemes for any other single-hop communication
network.

rotating objects provided the negative rotational energy of zero-point

this paper, we show that for massless electrically charged particles the
rotational vacuum effect should be drastically (astronomically) enhanced in the
presence of a magnetic field. As an illustration, we show that in a background
of experimentally available magnetic fields the zero-point energy of massless
excitations in rotating torus-shaped doped carbon nanotubes may indeed
overwhelm the classical energy of rotation for certain angular frequencies so
that the permanently rotating state is energetically favored. The suggested
""zero-point driven"" devices -- which have no internally moving parts --
correspond to a perpetuum mobile of a new, fourth kind: They do not produce any
work despite the fact that their equilibrium (ground) state corresponds to a
permanent rotation even in the presence of an external environment. We show

timing variations (TTVs) using a Bayesian approach.
  Methods: The observations were obtained using telescope-defocusing
techniques, and achieve a high precision with random errors in the photometry
as low as 1mmag per point. To investigate the possibility of TTVs in the light
curve, we calculate the overall probability of a TTV signal using Bayesian
methods.
  Results: The observations are used to determine the photometric parameters
and the physical properties of the GJ1214 system. Our results are in good
agreement with published values. Individual times of mid-transit are measured
with uncertainties as low as 10s, allowing us to reduce the uncertainty in the
orbital period by a factor of two.
  Conclusions: A Bayesian analysis reveals that it is highly improbable that
the observed transit times is explained by TTV, when compared with the simpler
alternative of a linear ephemeris.

typical of CVs at minimum light. One object appears to be a flare star, while
another has a spectrum consistent with a CV but lies, intriguingly, at the
center of a small nebulosity. We measured orbital periods for eight of the CVs,
and estimated distances for two based on the spectra of their secondary stars.
In addition to the spectra, we obtained direct imaging for an overlapping
sample of 37 objects, for which we give magnitudes and colors. Most of our new
orbital periods are shortward of the so-called period gap from roughly 2 to 3
hours. By considering the cross-identifications between the Catalina objects
and other catalogs such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we argue that a large
number of cataclysmic variables remain uncatalogued. By comparing the CRTS
sample to lists of previously-known CVs that CRTS does not recover, we find
that the CRTS is biased toward large outburst amplitudes (and hence shorter
orbital periods). We speculate that this is a consequence of the survey

better constrain these quantities. We use our SED-fitting tool including
nebular emission to analyze a large sample of LBGs, assuming five different
star formation histories, extending our first analysis of this sample (de
Barros et al. 2012, paper I). In addition we predict the IR luminosities
consistently with the SED fits.
  Compared to ""standard"" SED fits assuming constant SFR and neglecting nebular
lines, assuming variable SFHs yield systematically lower stellar masses, higher
extinction, higher SFR, higher IR luminosities, and a wider range of equivalent
widths for optical emission lines. Exponentially declining and delayed SFHs
yield basically identical results and generally fit best. Exponentially rising
SFHs yield similar masses, but somewhat higher extinction.
  We find significant deviations between the derived SFR and IR luminosity from
the commonly used SFR(IR) or SFR(IR+UV) calibration, due to differences in the
SFHs and ages. Models with variable SFHs, favored statistically, yield
generally a large scatter in the SFR-mass relation. We show that the true
scatter in the SFR-mass relation can be significantly larger than inferred
using SFR(UV) and/or SFR(IR).
  Different SFHs, and hence differences in the derived SFR-mass relation and in
the specific star formation rates, can be tested/constrained observationally
with future IR observations with ALMA. Measurement of emission lines, such as
Halpha and [OII]3727, can also provide useful constraints on the SED models. We
conclude that our findings of a large scatter in SFR-mass at high-z and an
increase of the specific star formation rate above z>~3 (paper I) can be tested

the solar azimuthal velocity in the Galactic rest frame Vg,\odot and hence the

reduce the set of assumptions to near axisymmetry of the disc and are designed
for kinematically hot stars, which are less affected by spiral arms and other
effects. The first two methods use the position-dependent rotational streaming
in the heliocentric radial velocities U. The resulting rotation estimate
{\theta} from U velocities does not depend on Vg,\odot. The first approach
compares this with rotation from the galactic azimuthal velocities to constrain
Vg,\odot at an assumed R0. Both Vg,\odot and R0 can be determined using the
proper motion of Sgr A\ast as a second constraint. The second strategy makes
use of {\theta} being roughly proportional to R0. Therefore a wrong R0 can be
detected by an unphysical trend of Vg,\odot with the intrinsic rotation of
different populations. From these two strategies I estimate R0 = (8.27 \pm
0.29) kpc and Vg,\odot = (250 \pm 9) kms-1 for a stellar sample from SEGUE, or
respectively Vc = (238 \pm 9) kms-1. The result is consistent with the third
estimator, where I use the angle of the mean motion of stars, which should
follow the geometry of the Galactic disc. This method also gives the Solar
radial motion with high accuracy. The rotation effect on U velocities must not
be neglected when measuring the Solar radial velocity U\odot. It biases U\odot
in any extended sample that is lop-sided in position angle {\alpha} by of order
10 kms-1. Combining different methods I find U\odot \sim 14 kms-1, moderately
higher than previous results from the Geneva-Copenhagen Survey.

derive dust corrected UV star formation rates (SFRs) as a function of radius

the spatial location of ongoing star formation. We find that the star formation
rates present in different regions of a galaxy reflect the already existent
stellar mass density, i.e. high density regions have higher star formation
rates than lower density regions, on average. This observed star formation is
extrapolated in several ways to the present day, and we measure the amount of
new stellar mass that is created in individual portions of each galaxy to
determine how the stellar mass added via star formation changes the observed
stellar mass profile, the Sersic index (n) and effective radius (R_e) over
time. We find that these massive galaxies fall into three broad classifications
of star formation distribution. These different star formation distributions
increase the effective radii over time, which are on average a factor of
~16pm5% larger, with little change in n (average Delta n=-0.9pm0.9) after
evolution. We also implement a range of simple stellar migration models into
the simulated evolutionary path of these galaxies in order to gauge its effect
on the properties of our sample. This yields a larger increase in the evolved
R_e than the pure static star formation model, with a maximum average increase
of Delta R_e~54pm19%, but with little change in n, Delta n ~-1.1pm1.3. These
results are not in agreement with the observed change in the R_e and n between

characterized by the mass ratio and a single effective total spin. The mapping
consists of a time-dependent rotation of the waveforms into the

parameter biases in the total spin of $\Delta \chi \leq 0.04$), even in the
case of transitional precession. In addition, we demonstrate a simple method to
construct hybrid post-Newtonian--numerical-relativity precessing-binary

particular a strong gamma-ray flare was observed in 2011 June reaching an
isotropic gamma-ray luminosity (0.1-300 GeV) of 1.0x10^48 erg/s, comparable to
that of the brightest flat spectrum radio quasars, and showing spectral

designed to detect planetary transits and asteroseismological signals from
solar-like stars, Kepler has provided high quality data for many areas of
investigation. Unconditioned simple aperture time-series photometry are however
affected by systematic structure. Examples of these systematics are
differential velocity aberration, thermal gradients across the spacecraft, and
pointing variations. While exhibiting some impact on Kepler's primary science,
these systematics can critically handicap potentially ground-breaking
scientific gains in other astrophysical areas, especially over long timescales
greater than 10 days. As the data archive grows to provide light curves for
$10^5$ stars of many years in length, Kepler will only fulfill its broad
potential for stellar astrophysics if these systematics are understood and
mitigated. Post-launch developments in the Kepler archive, data reduction
pipeline and open source data analysis software have occurred to remove or
reduce systematic artifacts. This paper provides a conceptual primer for users
of the Kepler data archive to understand and recognize systematic artifacts
within light curves and some methods for their removal. Specific examples of
artifact mitigation are provided using data available within the archive.
Through the methods defined here, the Kepler community will find a road map to
maximizing the quality and employment of the Kepler legacy archive.

that is independent and satisfies the property that every vertex $v \in V$ is
at a distance of at most $t$ from some vertex in $S$. A \textit{maximal
independent set (MIS)} is a 1-ruling set. The problem of computing an MIS on a
network is a fundamental problem in distributed algorithms and the fastest
algorithm for this problem is the $O(\log n)$-round algorithm due to Luby
(SICOMP 1986) and Alon et al. (J. Algorithms 1986) from more than 25 years ago.
Since then the problem has resisted all efforts to yield to a sub-logarithmic
algorithm. There has been recent progress on this problem, most importantly an
$O(\log \Delta \cdot \sqrt{\log n})$-round algorithm on graphs with $n$
vertices and maximum degree $\Delta$, due to Barenboim et al. (Barenboim,
Elkin, Pettie, and Schneider, April 2012, arxiv 1202.1983; to appear FOCS
2012).
  We approach the MIS problem from a different angle and ask if O(1)-ruling
sets can be computed much more efficiently than an MIS? As an answer to this
question, we show how to compute a 2-ruling set of an $n$-vertex graph in
$O((\log n)^{3/4})$ rounds. We also show that the above result can be improved
for special classes of graphs such as graphs with high girth, trees, and graphs
of bounded arboricity.
  Our main technique involves randomized sparsification that rapidly reduces
the graph degree while ensuring that every deleted vertex is close to some
vertex that remains. This technique may have further applications in other
contexts, e.g., in designing sub-logarithmic distributed approximation
algorithms. Our results raise intriguing questions about how quickly an MIS (or
1-ruling sets) can be computed, given that 2-ruling sets can be computed in
sub-logarithmic rounds.

sequence of functions, one for each clinical decision, where each function
takes as input up-to-date patient information and gives as output a single
recommended treatment. Current methods for estimating optimal dynamic treatment
regimes, for example Q-learning, require the specification of a single outcome
by which the `goodness' of competing dynamic treatment regimes are measured.
However, this is an over-simplification of the goal of clinical decision
making, which aims to balance several potentially competing outcomes. For
example, often a balance must be struck between treatment effectiveness and
side-effect burden. We propose a method for constructing dynamic treatment
regimes that accommodates competing outcomes by recommending sets of treatments
at each decision point. Formally, we construct a sequence of set-valued
functions that take as input up-to-date patient information and give as output
a recommended subset of the possible treatments. For a given patient history,
the recommended set of treatments contains all treatments that are not inferior
according to any of the competing outcomes. When there is more than one
decision point, constructing these set-valued functions requires solving a
non-trivial enumeration problem. We offer an exact enumeration algorithm by
recasting the problem as a linear mixed integer program. The proposed methods
are illustrated using data from a depression study and the CATIE schizophrenia

the importance of impact heating in the thermal evolution of planetesimals. We
find on a local scale that heating material to petrologic type 6 is achievable
for a range of impact velocities and initial porosities, and impact melting is
possible in porous material at a velocity of > 4 km/s. Burial of heated
impactor material beneath the impact crater is common, insulating that material
and allowing the parent body to retain the heat for extended periods (~
millions of years). Cooling rates at 773 K are typically 1 - 1000 K/Ma,
matching a wide range of measurements of metallographic cooling rates from
chondritic materials. While the heating presented here is localized to the

have occurred. Moreover, as most meteorite samples are on the centimeter to

a Gaussian mixture, and learn its parameters through expectation maximization,

understanding of hot accretion flows. One is that only a small fraction of
accretion flow available at the outer boundary can finally falls onto the black
hole while most of them is lost in outflow. Another one is that electrons may
directly receive a large fraction of the viscously dissipated energy in the
accretion flow, i.e, $\delta\sim 0.1-0.5$. The radiative efficiency of hot
accretion flow when these two progresses are taken into account has not been
systematically studied and is the subject of the present paper. We consider two
regimes of hot accretion model. One is the advection dominated accretion flows
(ADAFs) which lie on low accretion rate regime, $\la 10\alpha^2\ledd/c^2$;
another being the luminous hot accretion flows (LHAFs) which lie above this
accretion rate. For the latter, we assume that the accretion flow will has a
two-phase structure above a certain accretion rate, and a simplification is
adopted in our calculation of the dynamics. Our results indicate that the
radiative efficiency of hot accretion flow increases with the accretion rate
and is highly enhanced by the direct viscous heating to electrons compared to
the previous case of $\delta\ll 1$. When the accretion rate is high, the
radiative efficiency of hot accretion flow is comparable to that of the
standard thin disk. Fitting formulae of radiative efficiency as a function of
accretion rate for various $\delta$ values are presented.

inferences are made about different measurements that might have been

paradox is the paradigm example of such a paradox, where a ball is placed in
one of three boxes and it is inferred that it would have been found, with
certainty, both in box 1 and in box 2 had either box been opened on their own.
Precisely what is at stake in PPS paradoxes has been unclear, and classical
models have been suggested which are supposed to mimic the essential features
of the problem. We show that the essential difference between the classical and
quantum pre- and post-selection effects lies in the fact that for a quantum PPS
paradox to occur the intervening measurement, had it been performed, would need
to be invasive but non-detectable. This invasiveness is required even for null
result measurements. While some quasi-classical features (such as
non-contextuality and macrorealism) are compatible with PPS paradoxes, it seems
no fully classical model of the 3 box paradox is possible.

perspective proposed by one of the authors in a previous work and which
consists in predicting the occurrence of reactivation of latent tuberculosis
infection or newly acquired tuberculosis during treatment; this is based on
variational procedures on a simple set of parameters (e.g. rate of reactivation
of a latent infection). Then, we develop a full analytical study of this
approach through a Markov chain analysis and we find an exact solution for the
temporal evolution of the number of cases of tuberculosis infection
(re)activation. The analytical solution is compared with Monte Carlo
simulations and with experimental data, showing overall excellent agreement.
The generality of this theoretical framework allows to investigate also the
case of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections; in particular, we show that
reactivation in that context plays a minor role. This may suggest that, while
the screening for tuberculous is necessary prior to initiating biologics, when
considering non-tuberculous mycobacteria only a watchful monitoring during the
treatment is recommended. The framework outlined in this paper is quite general
and could be extremely promising in further researches on drug-related adverse
events.

framework based on operator algebras of classes of bounded linear operators.
This approach does not assume any state space representation and views LTV
systems as causal operators. After reducing the problem to a shortest distance
minimization in a space of bounded linear operators, duality theory is applied
to show existence of optimal solutions, which satisfy a ""time-varying"" allpass
or flatness condition. Under mild assumptions the optimal TV controller is
shown to be essentially unique. Next, the concept of M-ideals of operators is
used to show that the computation of time-varying (TV) controllers reduces to a
search over compact TV Youla parameters. This involves the norm of a TV compact
Hankel operator defined on the space of causal trace-class 2 operators and its
maximal vectors. Moreover, an operator identity to compute the optimal TV Youla
parameter is provided. These results are generalized to the mixed sensitivity
problem for TV systems as well, where it is shown that the optimum is equal to
the operator induced of a TV mixed Hankel-Toeplitz. The final outcome of the
approach developed here is that it leads to two tractable finite dimensional
convex optimizations producing estimates to the optimum within desired
tolerances, and a method to compute optimal time-varying controllers.

with 10^{-5} eV, the axion reveals a characteristic damping behavior in the
evolution of density perturbations on scales smaller than the solar system
size. The damping scale is inversely proportional to the square-root of the
axion mass. We show that the axion mass smaller than 10^{-24} eV induces a
significant damping in the baryonic density power spectrum in cosmologically
relevant scales, thus deviating from the cold dark matter in the scale smaller
than the axion Jeans scale. With such a small mass, however, our basic
assumption about the coherently oscillating scalar field is broken in the early

Bose-Einstein condensate and the ultra-light scalar field. We introduce a
simple model to avoid this problem by introducing evolving axion mass in the

entanglement exhibits period sudden birth and death. By choosing appropriate
parameter values, the initial maximal entanglement of the two atoms can be
frozen. The relation between the concurrence and cooperative parameter is
calculated.

post-Newtonian (2PN) approximation is obtained with Chandrasekhar's approach.
By focusing on an $N$-point-masses system as the first step, we reduce the
metric to its 2PN form for light propagation. Unlike previous works, at 2PN
order, we abandon the hierarchized hypothesis and do not assume two
parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$ to be unity.
We find that although there exist $\gamma$ and $\beta$ in the 2PN metric, only
$\gamma$ appears in the 2PN equations of light. As a simple example for
applications, a gauge-invariant angle between the directions of two incoming
photons for a differential measurement is investigated after the light
trajectory is solved in a static and spherically symmetric spacetime. It shows
the deviation from the general relativity (GR) $\delta\theta_{\mathrm{STT}}$
does \emph{not} depend on $\beta$ even at 2PN level in this circumstance, which
is consistent with previous results. A more complicated application is light
deflection in a 2-point-masses system. We consider a case that the light
propagation time is much less than the time scale of its orbital motion and
thus treat it as a static system. The 2-body effect at 2PN level originating
from relaxing the hierarchized hypothesis is calculated. Our analysis shows the
2PN 2-body effect in the Solar System is one order of magnitude less than
future $\sim 1$ nas experiments, while this effect could be comparable with 1PN
component of $\delta\theta_{\mathrm{STT}}$ in a binary system with two Sun-like
stars and separation by $\sim 0.1$ AU if an experiment would be able to measure
$\gamma-1$ down to $\sim 10^{-6}$.

layered (two-dimensional) crystal structure. The low dimensionality can affect
the electronic structure and can realize high transition temperatures (Tc)
and/or unconventional superconductivity mechanisms. As standard examples, we
now have two types of high-Tc superconductors. The first group is the Cu-oxide
superconductors whose crystal structure is basically composed of a stacking of
spacer (blocking) layers and superconducting CuO2 layers.1-4 The second group
is the Fe-based superconductors which also possess a stacking structure of
spacer layers and superconducting Fe2An2 (An = P, As, Se, Te) layers.5-13 In
both systems, dramatic enhancements of Tc are achieved by optimizing the spacer
layer structure, for instance, a variety of composing elements, spacer
thickness, and carrier doping levels with respect to the superconducting
layers. In this respect, to realize higher-Tc superconductivity, other than
Cu-oxide and Fe-based superconductors, the discovery of a new prototype of
layered superconductors needs to be achieved. Here we show superconductivity in
a new bismuth-oxysulfide layered compound Bi4O4S3. Crystal structure analysis
indicates that this superconductor has a layered structure composed of stacking
of Bi4O4(SO4)1-x and Bi2S4 layers; the parent compound (x = 0) is Bi6O8S5. Band
calculation suggests that Bi4O4S3 (x = 0.5) is metallic while Bi6O8S5 (x = 0)
is a band insulator with Bi3+. Furthermore, the Fermi level for Bi4O4S3 is just
on the peak position of the partial density of states of the Bi 6p orbital
within the BiS2 layer. The BiS2 layer is a basic structure which provides

spin freezing temperature T$_f$, the isothermal magnetization M(H) and the
temperature dependence of electronic specific heat C_e(T) exhibit anomalous
power-law singularities; both quantities are controlled by a single exponent.
The temperature dependence of magnetization M(T) also displays a power-law
behavior, but its exponent differs remarkably from that derived from M(H) and
C_e(T). Our analyses further reveal that the magnetization data M(H,T) obey a
phenomenological scaling law of M(H,T) \propto H^\alpha f(H/T^\delta) in a
temperature region between the spin freezing temperature T_f and the scaling
temperature T_scaling. T_scaling systematically decreases with the decease of
Ca content. This scaling law breaks down near the critical concentration x =
0.1 where a CSG-to-IMM phase transition occurs. We discussed these behaviors in

determined by a combination of superconducting quantum interference device
(SQUID) magnetometry, electrical transport measurements, soft x-ray magnetic
circular dichroism (SXMCD), XAS, and optical magnetic circular dichroism (OMCD)
and was supported by first-principle calculations. SXMCD and XAS measurements
revealed a 90% contribution to ferromagnetism from the Ti ions and a 10%
contribution from the O ions. RBS/channelling measurements show complete Ta
substitution in the Ti sites though carrier activation was only 50% at 5% Ta
concentration implying compensation by cationic defects. The role of Ti vacancy
and Ti3+ was studied via XAS and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS)
respectively. It was found that in films with strong ferromagnetism, the Ti
vacancy signal was strong while Ti3+ signal was absent. We propose (in the
absence of any obvious exchange mechanisms) that the localised magnetic
moments, Ti vacancy sites, are ferromagnetically ordered by itinerant carriers.
Cationic-defect-induced magnetism is an alternative route to ferromagnetism in

takes the opposite sign. Numerical estimates show that with a typical torsion

proven experimentally elusive, and to our knowledge no macroscopic experimental
demonstration of the difference between the predictions of the two mentioned

density of axions and gravitational waves. We find that the existence of
long-lived domain walls leads to the overproduction of cold dark matter axions,
while the density of gravitational waves is too small to observe at the present

the whole parameter region of models are excluded unless an unacceptable

gravity. This Weyl fluid of geometrical origin (reducing in the spherically
symmetric, static configuration to a dark radiation and dark pressure) modifies
space-time geometry around galaxies and has been shown to explain the flatness
of galactic rotation curves. Independent observations for discerning between
the Weyl fluid and other dark matter models are necessary. Gravitational
lensing could provide such a test. Therefore we study null geodesics and weak
gravitational lensing in the dark radiation dominated region of galaxies in a
class of spherically symmetric brane-world metrics. We find that the lensing
profile in the brane-world scenario is distinguishable from dark matter
lensing, despite both the brane-world scenario and dark matter models fitting
the rotation curve data. In particular, in the asymptotic regions light
deflection is 18% enhanced as compared to dark matter halo predictions. For a
linear equation of state of the Weyl fluid we further find a critical radius,
below which brane-world effects reduce, while above it they amplify light
deflection. This is in contrast to any dark matter model, the addition of which
always increases the deflection angle.

of periods ratio that are just slightly larger than some low order resonant
values. This feature occurs naturally when resonant couples undergo dissipation
that damps the eccentricities. However, the resonant angles appear to librate
at the end of the migration process, which is often believed to be an evidence
that the systems remain in resonance.
  Here we provide an analytical model for the dissipation in resonant planetary
systems valid for low eccentricities. We confirm that dissipation accounts for
an excess of pairs that lie just aside from the nominal periods ratios, as
observed by the Kepler mission. In addition, by a global analysis of the phase
space of the problem, we demonstrate that these final pairs are non-resonant.
Indeed, the separatrices that exist in the resonant systems disappear with the
dissipation, and remains only a circulation of the orbits around a single
elliptical fixed point. Furthermore, the apparent libration of the resonant
angles can be explained using the classical secular averaging method. We show
that this artifact is only due to the severe damping of the amplitudes of the
eigenmodes in the secular motion.

Preparations for DES have included building a dedicated 3 deg2 CCD camera

high performance computing (HPC) enabled data management system (DESDM).
  The DESDM system will be used for processing, calibrating and serving the DES
data. The total data volumes are high (~2PB), and so considerable effort has
gone into designing an automated processing and quality control system. Special
purpose image detrending and photometric calibration codes have been developed
to meet the data quality requirements, while survey astrometric calibration,
coaddition and cataloging rely on new extensions of the AstrOmatic codes which
now include tools for PSF modeling, PSF homogenization, PSF corrected model
fitting cataloging and joint model fitting across multiple input images.
  The DESDM system has been deployed on dedicated development clusters and HPC
systems in the US and Germany. An extensive program of testing with small rapid
turn-around and larger campaign simulated datasets has been carried out. The
system has also been tested on large real datasets, including Blanco Cosmology

an extension of the configuration model, in which stubs (half-edges) are paired
to form a network. Clustering is obtained by forming small completely connected
subgroups, and positive (negative) degree correlation is obtained by connecting
a fraction of the stubs with stubs of similar (dissimilar) degree. An SIR
(Susceptible -> Infective -> Recovered) epidemic model is defined on this
network. Asymptotic properties of both the network and the epidemic, as the
population size tends to infinity, are derived: the degree distribution, degree
correlation and clustering coefficient, as well as a reproduction number $R_*$,
the probability of a major outbreak and the relative size of such an outbreak.
The theory is illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations and numerical examples.
The main findings are that clustering tends to decrease the spread of disease,
the effect of degree correlation is appreciably greater when the disease is
close to threshold than when it is well above threshold and disease spread
broadly increases with degree correlation $\rho$ when $R_*$ is just above its
threshold value of one and decreases with $\rho$ when $R_*$ is well above one.

zero-temperature using the real-time renormalization group (RT-RG) in the
framework of a kinetic equation for the reduced density operator. We further
develop the general finite temperature real-time transport formalism by
introducing field superoperators that obey fermionic statistics. This direct
second quantization in Liouville-Fock space strongly simplifies the
construction of operators and superoperators which transform irreducibly under
the Anderson-model symmetry transformations. The fermionic field superoperators
naturally arise from the univalence (fermion-parity) superselection rule for
the total system. Expressed in these field superoperators, the causal structure
of the perturbation theory for the effective time-evolution
superoperator-kernel becomes explicit. The causal structure also implies the
existence of a fermion-parity protected eigenvector of the exact Liouvillian,
explaining a recently reported result on adiabatic driving [Phys. Rev. B 85,
075301 (2012)] and generalizing it to arbitrary order in the tunnel coupling.
Furthermore, in the WBL the causal representation exponentially reduces the
number of diagrams for the time-evolution kernel. We perform a complete 2-loop
RG analysis at finite voltage and magnetic field, while systematically
accounting for the dependence on both the quantum dot and reservoir
frequencies. Using the second quantization in Liouville-space and symmetry
restrictions we obtain analytical RT-RG equations with an efficient numerical
solution and we extensively study the model parameter space, excluding the
Kondo regime. The incorporated renormalization effects result in an enhancement
of the inelastic cotunneling peak. Moreover, we find a tunnel-induced
non-linearity of the stability diagrams at finite voltage, both in the SET and

bursting and tonic spiking or tonic spiking and silence. Bistability has been
proposed to endow neurons with richer forms of information processing in
general and to be involved in short-term memory in particular by allowing a
brief signal to elicit long-lasting changes in firing. In this paper, we focus
on bistability that allows for a choice between tonic spiking and
depolarization block in a wide range of the depolarization levels. We consider
the spike-producing currents in two neurons, models of which differ by the
parameter values. Our dopaminergic neuron model displays bistability in a wide
range of applied currents at the depolarization block. The Hodgkin-Huxley model
of the squid giant axon shows no bistability. We varied parameter values for
the model to analyze transitions between the two parameter sets. We show that
bistability primarily characterizes the inactivation of the Na+ current. Our
study suggests a connection between the amount of the Na+ window current and
the length of the bistability range. For the dopaminergic neuron we hypothesize
that bistability can be linked to a prolonged action of antipsychotic drugs.

previously published X-ray eclipse times from 1977 to 2008, to which we added
the eclipse time observed by Suzaku in 2006. This point is very important to
cover the time gap between the last RXTE eclipse time (taken in 2003) and the
most recent Chandra eclipse time (taken in 2008). Similarly we collected the
optical/UV eclipse arrival times covering the period from 1979 to 2006, adding
a further eclipse time taken on 1978 and updating previous optical/UV
ephemeris. We compared the X-ray and the optical/UV ephemeris, and finally
derived a new ephemeris of the source by combining the eclipse arrival times in
the X-ray and optical/UV bands. The X-ray eclipse time delays calculated with
respect to a constant orbital period model display a clear parabolic trend,
confirming that the orbital period of this source constantly increases at a
rate of $\dot{P}_{\rm{orb}} =1.51(7) \times 10^{-10}$ s/s. Combining the X-ray
and the optical/UV data sets, we find that $\dot{P}_{\rm{orb}} =1.59(9) \times
10^{-10}$ s/s, which is compatible with the X-ray orbital solution. We also
investigate the possible presence of a delay of the optical/UV eclipse with
respect to the X-ray eclipse, finding that this delay may not be constant in
time. In particular, this variation is compatible with a sinusoidal modulation
of the optical/UV eclipse arrival times with respect to the long-term parabolic
trend. In this case, the optical/UV eclipse should lag the X-ray eclipse and
the time-lag oscillate about an average value. (Abridged)

characteristics of Maya blue that has attracted the attention of scientists
since its rediscovery in 1931: its high stability against chemical aggression
(acids, alkalis, solvents, etc.) and biodegradation, which has permitted the
survival of many works of art for centuries in hostile environments, such as
the tropical forest. We have reproduced the different methods proposed to
produce a synthetic pigment with the characteristics of the ancient Maya blue.
The stability of the pigments produced using either palygorskite or sepiolite
has been analysed by performing acid attacks of different intensities. The
results are analysed in terms of pigment decolouration and destruction of the
clay lattice, revealed by X-ray diffraction. Palygorskite pigments are much

the relationship between the strength of the community structure and the

appealing, this analysis was not performed before. We adopt an approach based

possible field-induced exotic local spin-liquid-like, aligned-spin, and

low temperature reversible MCE material by at least a factor of 3. The
extremely large magnetic entropy change may be attributed to the large amount
of weakly interacting spins that can be easily aligned at low-lying energy in
the quantum critical regime of our nanosized materials, since there is large
MCE in the local spin-liquid-like (low energy excitation and even gapless

this case, the absolute change of the RQ $|\rho(x)-\rho(y)|$ becomes the

fundamental significance because Valiant and Roughgarden showed in 2006 that
`the ""global"" behaviour of an equilibrium flow in a large random network is
similar to that in Braess' original four-node example'. In this paper, a
natural generalisation of Braess' network is introduced and conditions for the
occurrence of Braess' paradox are formulated for the generalised network.
  The Braess' paradox has been studied mainly in the context of the classical
problem introduced by Braess and his colleagues, assuming a certain type of
networks. Specifically, two pairs of links in those networks are assumed to
have the same volume-delay functions. The occurrence of Braess' paradox for
this specific case of network symmetry was investigated by Pas and Principio in
1997. Such a symmetry is not common in real-life networks because the
parameters of volume-delay functions are associated with roads physical and
functional characteristics, which typically differ from one link to another
(e.g. roads in networks are of different length). Our research provides an
extension of previous studies on Braess' paradox by considering arbitrary
volume-delay functions, i.e. symmetry properties are not assumed for any of the
network's links and the occurrence of Braess' paradox is studied for a general
configuration.

  We find a similar rate of interaction in the type II quasars as in a

14%). However the surface brightness of the detected features is up to 2
magnitudes brighter for the type II quasars than for the quiescent early-types,
which have surface brightnesses in the range 22.1-26.1 mag arcsec sq and a
median surface brightness 24.3 mag arcsec sq. This may indicate that the
mergers witnessed in the comparison sample galaxies could have different
progenitors, or we may be viewing the interactions at different stages. We also
compare our results with a sample of radio-loud AGN and find a higher rate of
interaction signatures (95 +/- 21%) than in the type II quasars, but a very
similar range of surface brightnesses for the morphological features (20.9-24.8
mag arcsec sq), possibly indicating a similarity in the types of triggering
interactions.
  The range of features detected in the type II quasars suggests that AGN
activity can be triggered before, during or after the coalescence of the black
holes. Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that galaxy
interaction plays an important role in the triggering of quasar activity.

we show that it is possible to measure the Luttinger parameter of the

consistent with the chiral Luttinger theory prediction for the full hard-core

can a recommender system be accurate if users do not entrust it with their
private data? To answer this, we study the problem of learning item-clusters
under local differential privacy, a powerful, formal notion of data privacy. We
develop bounds on the sample-complexity of learning item-clusters from
privatized user inputs. Significantly, our results identify a sample-complexity
separation between learning in an information-rich and an information-scarce
regime, thereby highlighting the interaction between privacy and the amount of
information (ratings) available to each user.
  In the information-rich regime, where each user rates at least a constant
fraction of items, a spectral clustering approach is shown to achieve a
sample-complexity lower bound derived from a simple information-theoretic
argument based on Fano's inequality. However, the information-scarce regime,

fundamentally different approach both for lower bounds and algorithms. To this
end, we develop new techniques for bounding mutual information under a notion
of channel-mismatch, and also propose a new algorithm, MaxSense, and show that
it achieves optimal sample-complexity in this setting.
  The techniques we develop for bounding mutual information may be of broader
interest. To illustrate this, we show their applicability to $(i)$ learning

variety of application domains, extracting useful information in the form of
events, allowing experts or other systems to monitor and respond when
significant events are recognised. In a typical event recognition application,
however, these systems often have to deal with a significant amount of
uncertainty. In this paper, we address the issue of uncertainty in logic-based
event recognition by extending the Event Calculus with probabilistic reasoning.
Markov Logic Networks are a natural candidate for our logic-based formalism.
However, the temporal semantics of the Event Calculus introduce a number of
challenges for the proposed model. We show how and under what assumptions we
can overcome these problems. Additionally, we study how probabilistic modelling
changes the behaviour of the formalism, affecting its key property, the inertia
of fluents. Furthermore, we demonstrate the advantages of the probabilistic
Event Calculus through examples and experiments in the domain of activity
recognition, using a publicly available dataset for video surveillance.

approach, based on Reverse Monte Carlo modelling, that is capable of assessing
this dilemma. As a demonstration, we use the most frequently cited set of
""experimental"" partial radial distribution functions on liquid water and
investigate whether the 3 partials (O-O, O-H and H-H) are consistent with the
total structure factor of pure liquid D_2O from neutron diffraction and that of
H_2O from X-ray diffraction. We find that while neutron diffraction on heavy
water is in full agreement with all the 3 partials, the addition of X-ray
diffraction data clearly shows problems with the O-O partial radial
distribution function. We suggest that the approach introduced here may also be
used to establish whether partial radial distribution functions obtained from
statistical theories of the liquid state are consistent with the measured
structure factors.

(BCI) and Haptic interfaces. We propose to adapt haptic guides based on the
mental activity measured by a BCI system. This novel approach is illustrated
within a proof-of-concept system: haptic guides are toggled during a
path-following task thanks to a mental workload index provided by a BCI. The
aim of this system is to provide haptic assistance only when the user's brain
activity reflects a high mental workload. A user study conducted with 8
participants shows that our proof-of-concept is operational and exploitable.
Results show that activation of haptic guides occurs in the most difficult part
of the path-following task. Moreover it allows to increase task performance by
53% by activating assistance only 59% of the time. Taken together, these
results suggest that BCI could be used to determine when the user needs
assistance during haptic interaction and to enable haptic guides accordingly.

(ASEP). Subsystems consisting of ASEPs are connected by bidirectional links
with each other, which results in balance between every pair of subsystems. The
network includes some specific important cases discussed in earlier works such
as the ASEP with the Langmuir kinetics, multiple lanes and finite reservoirs.
Probability distributions of particles in the steady state are exactly given in
factorized forms according to their balance properties. Although the system has
nonequilibrium parts, the expressions are well described in a framework of
statistical mechanics based on equilibrium states. Moreover, the overall
argument does not depend on the network structures, and the knowledge obtained
in this work is applicable to a broad range of problems.

relativity merges space with time. We tried to show that it is possible to
model space as three complex coordinates. In our construction, the usual
spatial coordinate are the real part while time is considered as parameter of a
path attached to each spatial point in imaginary parts. For flat spacetime,
Lorentz invariant is realized on induced metric. We first consider the space as
a six dimensional real manifold corresponding to the three complex coordinates.
The complex structure is then implemented in a reference frame dependent
manner. With this complex structure, Lorentz transformation induces a
holomorphic transformation in the complex manifold so that spatial coordinate
remained to be viewed as real axis. Scalar field in complex space could induce
a field that satisfying Klein-Gordon equation on spacetime. Finally we
described possible construction of gravity by using equivalence principle.
Assuming the coordinate transformation to an accelerating observer also induces
a holomorphic transformation, we outlined how to recover general relativity in
Hamiltonian formalism.

the junctionless transistors. The simulation results are consistent with the
experimental measurements and provide new insights on the depletion effect of
the hetero-doped gate on the drain current. Based on the calculated I-V curves,
a compact model is then constructed for the junctionless transistors. The
validity of the compact model is further verified by the transient circuit

of previous tests, and when to stop and make a diagnosis. Cost-sensitive
diagnostic policies perform tradeoffs between (a) the cost of tests and (b) the
cost of misdiagnoses. An optimal diagnostic policy minimizes the expected total
cost. We formalize this diagnosis process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
We investigate two types of algorithms for solving this MDP: systematic search
based on AO* algorithm and greedy search (particularly the Value of Information
method). We investigate the issue of learning the MDP probabilities from
examples, but only as they are relevant to the search for good policies. We do
not learn nor assume a Bayesian network for the diagnosis process. Regularizers
are developed to control overfitting and speed up the search. This research is
the first that integrates overfitting prevention into systematic search. The
paper has two contributions: it discusses the factors that make systematic
search feasible for diagnosis, and it shows experimentally, on benchmark data
sets, that systematic search methods produce better diagnostic policies than
greedy methods.

This paper introduces MTE influence diagrams, which can represent decision
problems without restrictions on the relationships between continuous and
discrete chance variables, without limitations on the distributions of
continuous chance variables, and without limitations on the nature of the
utility functions. In MTE influence diagrams, all probability distributions and
the joint utility function (or its multiplicative factors) are represented by
MTE potentials and decision nodes are assumed to have discrete state spaces.
MTE influence diagrams are solved by variable elimination using a fusion
algorithm.

set of variables, with a DAG structure representing immediate dependencies
among the variables. For each node, a table of parameters (CPtable) represents
local conditional probabilities, with rows indexed by conditioning events
(assignments to parents). CP-table rows are usually modeled as independent
random vectors, each assigned a Dirichlet prior distribution. The assumption
that rows are independent permits a relatively simple analysis but may not
reflect actual prior opinion about the parameters. Rows representing similar
conditioning events often have similar conditional probabilities. This paper
introduces a more flexible family of ""dependent Dirichlet"" prior distributions,
where rows are not necessarily independent. Simple methods are developed to
approximate the Bayes estimators of CP-table parameters with optimal linear
estimators; i.e., linear combinations of sample proportions and prior means.
This approach yields more efficient estimators by sharing information among
rows. Improvements in efficiency can be substantial when a CP-table has many
rows and samples sizes are small.

very similar structure may locally have completely different measurements,
e.g., images taken under different illumination conditions, or the speech
signal captured in different environments. While there have been many
successful attempts to address these problems in application-specific settings,
we believe that underlying a large set of problems in signal representation is
a representational deficiency of intensity-derived local measurements that are
the basis of most efficient models. We argue that interesting structure in
signals is better captured when the signal is de- fined as a matrix whose
entries are discrete indices to a separate palette of possible measurements. In
order to model the variability in signal structure, we define a signal class
not by a single index map, but by a probability distribution over the index
maps, which can be estimated from the data, and which we call probabilistic
index maps. The existing algorithm can be adapted to work with this
representation. Furthermore, the probabilistic index map representation leads
to algorithms with computational costs proportional to either the size of the
palette or the log of the size of the palette, making the cost of significantly
increased invariance to non-structural changes quite bearable. We illustrate
the benefits of the probabilistic index map representation in several
applications in computer vision and speech processing.

new methods, we also cast existing unsupervised probabilistic record-linkage
methods in this framework. Some of the techniques we propose to minimize
overfitting in the above model are of interest in the general graphical model

quite competitively even with fully supervised record-linkage methods.
