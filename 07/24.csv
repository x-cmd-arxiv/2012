system-wide monitoring and remote control from a central location. Control
systems are widely used in critical infrastructures such as electric grid,
natural gas, water and wastewater industries. While control systems can be
vulnerable to a variety of types of cyber attacks that could have devastating
consequences, little research has been done to secure the control systems.

SCADA systems. American Gas Association (AGA) had originally been designing
cryptographic standard to protect SCADA communication links and finished the

This paper presents an attack on the protocols in the first draft of AGA
standard (Wright et al., 2004). This attack shows that the security mechanisms
in the first version of the AGA standard protocol could be easily defeated. We
then propose a suite of security protocols optimised for SCADA/DCS systems

channels, authenticated emergency channels, and revised authenticated emergency
channels. These protocols are designed to address the specific challenges that

initial state to a final state. Hence it can be characterized from the point of
view of communication theory, i.e., in terms of its ability to transfer
information. Quantum information provides a theoretical framework and the
proper mathematical tools to accomplish this. In this context the notion of
codes and communication capacities have been introduced by generalizing them
from the classical Shannon theory of information transmission and error
correction. The underlying assumption of this approach is to consider the
channel not as acting on a single system, but on sequences of systems, which,
when properly initialized allow one to overcome the noisy effects induced by
the physical process under consideration. While most of the work produced so
far has been focused on the case in which a given channel transformation acts
identically and independently on the various elements of the sequence
(memoryless configuration in jargon), correlated error models appear to be a
more realistic way to approach the problem. A slightly different, yet
conceptually related, notion of correlated errors applies to a single quantum
system which evolves continuously in time under the influence of an external
disturbance which acts on it in a non-Markovian fashion. This leads to the
study of memory effects in quantum channels: a fertile ground where interesting
novel phenomena emerge at the intersection of quantum information theory and
other branches of physics. A survey is taken of the field of quantum channels
theory while also embracing these specific and complex settings.

gravitational influence of the planets has a non-negligible effect on the
causes of the solar magnetic cycle. In this work we looked for a possible
causal link in relation with solar barycentric dynamics and prolonged minima
events. We searched for particular changes in the Sun's acceleration and
concentrated on long-term variations of the solar cycle. We show how the
orbital angular momentum of the Sun evolves and how the inclination of the
solar barycentric orbit varies during the epochs of orbital retrogressions. In
particular, at these moments, the radial component of the Sun's acceleration
(i.e., in the barycentre-Sun direction) had an exceptional magnitude. These
radial impulses occurred at the very beginning of the Maunder Minimum, during
the Dalton Minimum and also at the maximum of cycle 22 before the present
extended minimum. We also found a strong correlation between the planetary
torque and the observed sunspots international number around that maximum. We
apply our results in a novel theory of Sun-planets interaction that it is
sensitive to Sun barycentric dynamics and found a very important effect on the
Sun's capability of storing hypothetical reservoirs of potential energy that
could be released by internal flows and might be related to the solar cycle.
This process begins about 40 years before the solar angular momentum
inversions, i.e., before Maunder Minimum, Dalton Minimum, and before the
present extended minimum. Our conclusions suggest a dynamical characterization
of peculiar prolonged solar minima. We discuss the possible implications of
these results for the solar cycle including the present extended minimum.

a model and security definition for authenticated key exchange. They claimed
that in the ideal-cipher model (random oracles), the two-flow protocol at the
core of Encrypted Key Exchange (EKE) is secure. Bellare and Rogaway suggested
several instantiations of the ideal cipher in their proposal to the IEEE
P1363.2 working group. Since then there has been an increased interest in
proving the security of password-based protocols in the ideal-cipher model. For
example, Bresson, Chevassut, and Pointcheval have recently showed that the

model. In this paper, we present examples of real (NOT ideal) ciphers

without a rigorous metric for ideal-ciphers, the value of provable security in

Our extension is now made for studying the long-time behavior of some strongly
continuous semigroup generated by a (degenerate) Kolmogorov backward operator
L. Additionally, we introduce several domain issues into the framework.
Necessary conditions for proving hypocoercivity need then only to be verified
on some fixed operator core of L. Furthermore, the setting is also suitable for
covering existence and construction problems as required in many applications.
The methods are applicable to various, different, Kolmogorov backward evolution
problems. As a main part, we apply the extended framework to the (degenerate)
spherical velocity Langevin equation. The latter can be seen as some kind of an
analogue to the classical Langevin equation in case spherical velocities are
required. This model is of important industrial relevance and describes the
fiber lay-down in the production process of nonwovens. For the construction of

structures is performed: PET, PEN and two PET/PEN blends (90/10 and 70/30 w/w).
During the melt processing of the blends transesterification reactions yield
block and random PET/PEN copolymers that act as compatibilizers. The blends
obtained in this way have been characterized by 1H-NMR and DSC. A degree of
randomness of 0.38 and 0.26 has been found for the 90/10 and 70/30 copolymers.
It is shown by DSC that this copolimerization is enough to compatibilize the
blends. The alpha relaxation, the dielectric manifestation of the glass
transition, has been studied by thermally stimulated depolarization currents
(TSDC). The relaxation has been analyzed into its elementary modes by means of
a relaxation map analysis. The activation energies of the modes of the glass
transition do not change significantly between the four materials: in all cases
the modes with a larger contribution have around 3 eV and modes with less than
1 eV are not detected. The change in the pre-exponential factor accounts
entirely for the relaxation time change from material to material, that is
larger as the PEN content increases. The compensation law is fulfilled and
compensation plots converge for high-frequency modes. The polarizability
decreases as the PEN content increases due to the increased stiffness of the
polymer backbone. An analysis of the cooperativity shows that the central modes
of the distribution are the most cooperative while high-frequency modes tend to
behave more as Arrhenius. The low-frequency modes are difficult to study due to
the asymmetry of the distribution of relaxation times. PEN turns out to be the
less cooperative material. It is demonstrated how the parameters obtained from

solve the naturalness and susy flavor problems now require a fair degree of
complexity. Here we consider the simplest possibility for supersymmetry near
the weak scale, but with the requirement of naturalness dropped. In ""pure
gravity mediation"", all supersymmetric particles except for the gauginos lie at
tens to thousands of TeV, with the gauginos obtaining loop suppressed masses
automatically by anomaly mediation and higgsino threshold corrections. The
gauginos are the lightest superpartners, and we investigate the current
collider constraints on their masses, as well as the future reach of the LHC.
We consider gluino pair production with a jets + missing energy signature, as
well as events with disappearing charged tracks caused by charged winos
decaying into their neutral partners. We show that presently, gluino masses
less than about 1 TeV and wino masses less than about 300 GeV are excluded, and
that the 14 TeV LHC can probe gluino masses up to about 2 TeV and wino masses
up to 1 TeV.

the limiting of the physical mass value $m \leq m_{max}= {m_1}^2/2m_2$ takes
place for the case of a fermion field with a $\gamma_5$-dependent mass term
($m\rightarrow m_1 +\gamma_5 m_2 $). In the regions of unbroken $\cal PT$
symmetry the Hamiltonian $H$ has another symmetry represented by a linear
operator $ \cal C$. We exactly construct this operator by using a
non-perturbative method. In terms of $ \cal C$ operator we calculate a
time-independent inner product with a positive-defined norm. As a consequence
of finiteness mass spectrum we have the $\cal PT$-symmetric Hamiltonian in the
areas $(m\leq m_{max})$, but beyond this limits $\cal PT$-symmetry is broken.
Thus, we obtain that the basic results of the fermion field model with a
$\gamma_5$-dependent mass term is equivalent to the Model with a Maximal Mass
which for decades has been developed by V.Kadyshevsky and his colleagues. In
their numerous papers the condition of finiteness of elementary particle mass
spectrum was introduced in a purely geometric way, just as the velocity of
light is a maximal velocity in the special relativity. The adequate geometrical
realization of the limiting mass hypothesis is added up to the choice of (anti)
de Sitter momentum space of the constant curvature.

of the galaxy spin and can therefore be used to analyze a large galaxy dataset.
The results show that the local universe (z<0.3) is not isotropic in terms of
galaxy spin, with probability P<5.8*10^-6 of such asymmetry to occur by chance.
The handedness asymmetries exhibit an approximate cosine dependence, and the
most likely dipole axis was found at RA=132, DEC=32 with 1 sigma error range of
107 to 179 degrees for the RA. The probability of such axis to occur by chance
is P<1.95*10^-5 . The amplitude of the handedness asymmetry reported in this

improved by a factor of 40, and the direction of the axis disagrees somewhat.

relative phase has significant effects on both the evolution of the atomic
excited-state population and the information flow between the atom and the
reservoir, as quantified by the trace distance. Furthermore, by considering two
two-level atoms interacting with a common damped mode of the radiation field,
we highlight how initial relative phases can affect the subsequent entanglement
dynamics.

one end by a stopper and at the other end by a piston. All surfaces are hard
and frictionless. A uniform gravitational field is directed parallel to the
plane of the disks and perpendicular to the axis of the channel. We employ a
method of configurational statistics that interprets jammed states as
configurations of floating particles with structure. The particles interlink
according to set rules. The two jammed microstates with smallest volume act as
pseudo-vacuum. The placement of particles is subject to a generalized Pauli
principle. Jammed macrostates are generated by random agitations and specified
by two control variables. One is a measure of the intensity of random
agitations at given pressure. The other is a measure of the change in
gravitational potential energy in units of compression work when one particle
is excited. In this two-dimensional space of variables there exists a critical
point. The jammed macrostate realized at the critical point depends on the path
of approach. We describe all jammed macrostates by volume and entropy. Both are
functions of the average population densities of particles. Approaching the
critical point in an extended space of control variables generates two types of
jammed macrostates: states with random heterogeneities in mass density and
states with domains of uniform mass density.

justifications for the new properties found in these materials. In order to
describe these new effects some theories were adapted and some others have been
tried. In this work we present an application of the fractional calculus to
study the superconductor in the context of London theory. Here we investigated
the linear London equation modified by fractional derivatives for
non-differentiable functions, instead of integer ones, in a coarse grained
scenario. We apply the fractional approach based in the modified
Riemann-Liouville sense to improve the model in order to include possible
non-local interactions and the media. It is argued that the e ects of
non-locality and long memory, intrinsic to the formalism of the fractional
calculus, are relevant to achieving a satisfactory phenomenological
description. In order to compare the present results with the usual London
theory, we calculated the magnetic field distribution for a mesoscopic
superconductor system. Also, a fractional Pippard-like model is proposed to
take into account the non-locality beside effects of interactions and the
media. We propose that parameter alfa of fractionality can be used to create an
alternative way to characterize superconductors.

ratios of the higher order Balmer lines. The H\beta\ and H\gamma\ pair of lines
is detected with S/N>5 in 55 individual objects and the H\beta\ and H\delta\
pair is detected in 50 individual objects. We also create stacked spectra to
probe the attenuation in objects without individual detections. The median
attenuation at H\alpha\ based on the objects with individually detected lines
is A(H\alpha)=0.9+-1.0 magnitudes, in good agreement with the attenuation found
in local samples of star-forming galaxies. We find that the z=0.8 galaxies
occupy a similar locus of attenuation as a function of magnitude, mass and SFR

infinite set of non-linear integral equations of the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz

range of parameter space, it is natural to have the coupling to vectors, cV,
approximately constant, while the coupling to fermions, cf, is suppressed. This
leads to enhanced VBF signals of gamma gamma while keeping other signals of
Higgses approximately constant (such as WW* and ZZ*), and suppressing higgs to
tau tau. Sizable tree-level effects are often accompanied by light charged
Higgs states, which lead to important constraints from b to s gamma and top to
b H+, but also often to similarly sizable contributions to the inclusive h to
gamma gamma signal from radiative effects. In the simplest model, this is
described by a Type I 2HDM, and in supersymmetry is naturally realized with

contribute further with fewer constraints from heavy flavor decays. With
supersymmetry, Grand Unification motivates the inclusion of colored partner
fields. These G-quarks may provide additional evidence for such a model.

biochemical reaction processes on 2-dimensional surfaces using a model of
signal transduction processes on biomembranes. We perform simulations of the
2-dimensional cell-based model, which describes the reactions and diffusion of
the receptors, signaling proteins, target proteins, and crowders on the cell
membrane. The signaling proteins are activated by receptors, and these
activated signaling proteins activate target proteins that bind autonomously
from the cytoplasm to the membrane, and unbind from the membrane if activated.
If the target proteins bind frequently, the volume fraction of molecules on the
membrane becomes so large that the excluded volume of the molecules for the
reaction and diffusion dynamics cannot be negligible. We find that such
excluded volume effects of the molecules induce non-trivial variations of the
signal flow, defined as the activation frequency of target proteins, as
follows. With an increase in the binding rate of target proteins, the signal
flow varies by i) monotonically increasing; ii) increasing then decreasing in a
bell-shaped curve; or iii) increasing, decreasing, then increasing in an
S-shaped curve. We further demonstrate that the excluded volume of molecules
influences the hierarchical molecular distributions throughout the reaction
processes. In particular, when the system exhibits a large signal flow, the
signaling proteins tend to surround the receptors to form receptor-signaling
protein clusters, and the target proteins tend to become distributed around
such clusters. To explain these phenomena, we analyze the stochastic model of
the local motions of molecules around the receptor.

domain walls in tetragonal phase of perovskite ferroelectrics is studied. The
effect is shown to lower the symmetry of 180-degree walls which are oblique
with respect to the cubic crystallographic axes, while {100} and {110} walls
stay ""untouched"". Being of the Ising type in the absence of the flexoelectric
interaction, the oblique domain walls acquire a new polarization component with
a structure qualitatively different from the classical Bloch-wall structure. In
contrast to the Bloch-type walls, where the polarization vector draws a helix
on passing from one domain to the other, in the flexoeffect-affected wall, the
polarization rotates in opposite directions on the two sides of the wall and
passes through zero in its center. Since the resulting polarization profile is
invariant upon inversion with respect to the wall center it does not brake the
wall symmetry in contrast to the classical Bloch-type walls. The flexoelectric
coupling lower the domain wall energy and gives rise to its additional
anisotropy that is comparable to that conditioned by the elastic anisotropy.
The atomic orderof- magnitude estimates shows that the new polarization
component P2 may be comparable with spontaneous polarization Ps, thus
suggesting that, in general, the flexoelectric coupling should be mandatory
included in domain wall simulations in ferroelectrics. Calculations performed
for barium titanate yields the maximal value of the P2, which is much smaller
than that of the spontaneous polarization. This smallness is attributed to an
anomalously small value of a component of the ""strain-polarization""
elecrostictive tensor in this material.

with the results from Paranjape & Sheth (2012, PS12) who show that the
magnitude distribution of the brightest and second brightest galaxies can be
explained based on order statistics of luminosities randomly sampled from the
total galaxy luminosity function. We find that a conditional luminosity
function (CLF) for galaxies which varies with halo mass, in a manner which is
consistent with existing observations, naturally leads to a magnitude gap
distribution which changes as a function of halo mass at fixed richness, in
qualitative agreement with H12. We show that, in general, the luminosity
distribution of the brightest and the second brightest galaxy depends upon
whether the luminosities of galaxies are drawn from the CLF or the global
luminosity function. However, we also show that the difference between the two
cases is small enough to evade detection in the small sample investigated by
PS12. This shows that the luminosity distribution is not the appropriate
statistic to distinguish between the two cases, given the small sample size. We
argue in favor of the CLF (and therefore H12) based upon its consistency with
other independent observations, such as the kinematics of satellite galaxies,
the abundance and clustering of galaxies, and the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.

galaxies in the local universe. We examine three samples of galaxies with
metallicities and star formation rates at z = 0.07, 0.8 and 2.26, including the
SDSS and DEEP2 surveys. We infer the total mass of oxygen produced and mass of
oxygen found in the gas-phase from our local SDSS sample. The star formation
history is determined by requiring that galaxies evolve along the relation
between stellar mass and star formation rate observed in our three samples. We
show that the observed relation between stellar mass and star formation rate
for our three samples is consistent with other samples in the literature. The
mass-metallicity relation is well established for our three samples and from
this we empirically determine the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies.
Thus, we are able to simultaneously constrain the star formation rates and
metallicities of galaxies over cosmic time allowing us to estimate the mass of
oxygen locked up in stars. Combining this work with independent measurements
reported in the literature we conclude that the loss of oxygen from the
interstellar medium of local star-forming galaxies is likely to be a ubiquitous
process with the oxygen mass loss scaling (almost) linearly with stellar mass.
We estimate the total baryonic mass loss and argue that only a small fraction
of the baryons inferred from cosmological observations accrete onto galaxies.

between 10^4.5 and 10^7 K. At these temperatures, cooling is dominated by
metal-line emission if the metallicity Z>~0.1 Zsun. We explore the
detectability of several lines using large cosmological, hydrodynamical

the expected mean surface brightness profiles for different halo masses.
Assuming a detection limit of 10^-1 photon s^-1 cm^-2 sr^-1, proposed X-ray

radius (Rvir) of groups and clusters and out to 0.4Rvir for haloes with masses

detected out to smaller radii, 0.1-0.5Rvir. With a detection limit of 10^-20
erg s^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2, future UV telescopes can detect C III emission out to
0.2-0.6Rvir at z=0.25. C IV, O VI, Si III, and Si IV can be seen out to
0.1-0.2Rvir for Mhalo>10^12 Msun. Optical HI H-alpha emission is comparable in
strength to C III emission. At z=3 it may be possible to observe C III out to
0.2-0.3Rvir and other rest-frame UV lines out to ~0.1Rvir for Mhalo>10^11 Msun
with upcoming optical instruments. Metal-line emission is typically biased
towards high density and metallicity and towards the temperature at which the
emissivity curve of the corresponding metal line peaks. The bias is similar for
the different soft X-ray lines considered, whereas it varies strongly between
different UV lines. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback can change the inner
surface brightness profiles significantly, but it generally does not change the
radius out to which the emission can be observed. Metal-line emission is a
promising probe of the warm and hot, enriched gas around galaxies and provides
a unique window into the interactions between galaxies and their gaseous
haloes.

Tseliakhovich & Hirata showed that the relative ""stream"" velocity between the

effect, but an unusually large one - can influence the later structure
formation history of the Universe. We quantify the effect of the stream
velocity on the so-called ""characteristic mass"" - the minimum mass of a dark
matter halo capable of retaining most of its baryons throughout its formation
epoch - using three different high-resolution sets of cosmological simulations
(with separate transfer functions for baryons and dark matter) that vary in box
size, particle number, and the value of the relative velocity between the dark
matter and baryons. In order to understand this effect theoretically, we
generalize the linear theory filtering mass to properly account for the
difference between the dark matter and baryonic density fluctuation evolution
induced by the stream velocity. We show that the new filtering mass provides an
accurate estimate for the characteristic mass, while other theoretical ansatzes
for the characteristic mass are substantially less precise.

this setting. We also show that every feasible Bayesian auction can be
implemented as a distribution over virtual VCG allocation rules. A virtual VCG
allocation rule has the following simple form: Every bidder's type t_i is
transformed into a virtual type f_i(t_i), via a bidder-specific function. Then,
the allocation maximizing virtual welfare is chosen. Using this
characterization, we show how to find and run the revenue-optimal auction given
only black box access to an implementation of the VCG allocation rule. We
generalize this result to arbitrarily correlated bidders, introducing the

  We obtain our reduction from revenue to welfare optimization via two
algorithmic results on reduced forms in settings with arbitrary feasibility and

feasibility of a reduced form. Second, we provide a geometric algorithm to
decompose any feasible reduced form into a distribution over virtual VCG

motivates a consideration of a broader range of models. We consider a simple
addition to the MSSM of a ""Sister Higgs"" ($\Sigma_d$), a Higgs field that
participates in electroweak symmetry breaking but does not give any direct
masses to Standard Model matter fields. While a relatively minor addition, the
phenomenological implications can be important. Such a field can be naturally
charged under an additional symmetry group $G_s$. If gauged, the Higgs mass is
naturally much larger than in the MSSM through an NMSSM-type interaction, but
with $\Sigma_d$ playing the role of $H_d$. The addition of the sister Higgs
allows new R-parity violating operators $\Sigma_d H_d E$, which are less
constrained than conventional leptonic R-parity violation. Considerations of
unification motivates the presence of colored $G_s$-charged fields. Production
of these G-quarks can lead to new b-rich final states and modifications to
decays of gluinos, as well as new opportunities for R-parity violation. Unlike
a conventional fourth generation, G-quarks dominantly decay into a light jet
and a scalar (potentially the Higgs), which then generally decays to b-jets.
The presence of additional sister charges allows the possibilities that
lightest sister-charged particle (LSiP) could be stable. We consider the
possibility of an LSiP dark matter candidate and find it is generally very
constrained.

apply this result to critically assess an important conjecture recently made in

discord should always be lower bounded by squared negativity. This conjecture
has strengthened the common belief that measures of generic quantum
correlations should be more than those of entanglement. Our analysis shows that
unfortunately this is not the case and we give several counterexamples to this
conjecture. All the examples considered here are in finite dimensions.
Surprisingly, there are counterexamples in $2\otimes n$ for any $n>2$.
Coincidentally, it appears that the $4\otimes 4$ Werner state, when seen as a
$2\otimes 8$ dimensional state, also violates the conjecture. This result
contributes significantly to the negative side of the current ongoing debates
on the defining notion of geometric discord as a good measure of generic

dispersion relation, fixed by integrability up to an unknown interpolating
function h(lambda), to explicit one-loop calculations on the string worldsheet.
For AdS(3) x S(3) x S(3) x S(1) the spectrum contains heavy, as well as light

modularity and hierarchy, whose composition may be compactly described. This
renders metabolic architecture comprehensible as a system, and suggests the
order in which layers of that system emerged. Metabolism also serves as the
foundation in other hierarchies, at least up to cellular integration including
bioenergetics and molecular replication, and trophic ecology. The
recapitulation of patterns first seen in metabolism, in these higher levels,
suggests metabolism as a source of causation or constraint on many forms of
organization in the biosphere.
  We identify as modules widely reused subsets of chemicals, reactions, or
functions, each with a conserved internal structure. At the small molecule
substrate level, module boundaries are generally associated with the most
complex reaction mechanisms and the most conserved enzymes. Cofactors form a
structurally and functionally distinctive control layer over the small-molecule
substrate. Complex cofactors are often used at module boundaries of the
substrate level, while simpler ones participate in widely used reactions.
Cofactor functions thus act as ""keys"" that incorporate classes of organic
reactions within biochemistry.
  The same modules that organize the compositional diversity of metabolism are
argued to have governed long-term evolution. Early evolution of core
metabolism, especially carbon-fixation, appears to have required few
innovations among a small number of conserved modules, to produce adaptations
to simple biogeochemical changes of environment. We demonstrate these features
of metabolism at several levels of hierarchy, beginning with the small-molecule
substrate and network architecture, continuing with cofactors and key conserved
reactions, and culminating in the aggregation of multiple diverse physical and
biochemical processes in cells.

of ~ 3 higher than the true clump mass function, due to projection of
low-density material along the line of sight. Alves et al. (2007) first
proposed that a shift of a clump mass function to higher masses by a factor of

Multi-armed Bandit problem (MAB) that minimizes the cumulative regret. However,
search differs from MAB in that in MCTS it is usually only the final ""arm pull""
(the actual move selection) that collects a reward, rather than all ""arm
pulls"". Therefore, it makes more sense to minimize the simple regret, as
opposed to the cumulative regret. We begin by introducing policies for
multi-armed bandits with lower finite-time and asymptotic simple regret than
UCB, using it to develop a two-stage scheme (SR+CR) for MCTS which outperforms
UCT empirically.
  Optimizing the sampling process is itself a metareasoning problem, a solution
of which can use value of information (VOI) techniques. Although the theory of
VOI for search exists, applying it to MCTS is non-trivial, as typical myopic
assumptions fail. Lacking a complete working VOI theory for MCTS, we
nevertheless propose a sampling scheme that is ""aware"" of VOI, achieving an
algorithm that in empirical evaluation outperforms both UCT and the other
proposed algorithms.

probed by the SDSS. Our study is conducted from the perspective of a user of
the models, who has observational data in hand and seeks to convert them into
physical quantities. Stellar population models for galaxies are created by
synthesizing star formations histories and chemical enrichments using single
stellar populations from several groups (Starburst99, GALAXEV, Maraston2005,
GALEV). The role of dust is addressed through a simplistic, but observationally
motivated, dust model that couples the amplitude of the extinction to the star
formation history, metallicity and the viewing angle. Moreover, the influence
of emission lines is considered (for the subset of models for which this
component is included). The performance of the models is investigated by: 1)
comparing their prediction with the observed galaxy population in the SDSS
using the (u-g)-(r-i) and (g-r)-(i-z) color planes, 2) comparing predicted
stellar mass and luminosity weighted ages and metallicities, specific star
formation rates, mass to light ratios and total extinctions with literature
values from studies based on spectroscopy. Strong differences between the
various models are seen, with several models occupying regions in the
color-color diagrams where no galaxies are observed. We would therefore like to
emphasize the importance of the choice of model. Using our preferred model we
find that the star formation history, metallicity and also dust content can be
constrained over a large part of the parameter space through the use of
u,g,r,i,z-band photometry. However, strong local degeneracies are present due
to overlap of models with high and low extinction in certain parts of color
space.

extensive interests in applying LT code techniques to distributed storage

Thomason's experimental results show that LDPC code performs well only
asymptotically when the number of data fragments increases and it has the worst
performance for small number of data fragments (e.g., less than 100). In their
INFOCOM 2012 paper, Cao, Yu, Yang, Lou, and Hou proposed to use exhaustive
search approach to find a deterministic LT code that could be used to decode
the original data content correctly in distributed storage systems. However, by
Plank and Thomason's experimental results, it is not clear whether the
exhaustive search approach will work efficiently or even correctly. This paper
carries out the theoretical analysis on the feasibility and performance issues
for applying LT codes to distributed storage systems. By employing the
underlying ideas of efficient Belief Propagation (BP) decoding process in LT
codes, this paper introduces two classes of codes called flat BP-XOR codes and
array BP-XOR codes (which can be considered as a deterministic version of LT
codes). We will show the equivalence between the edge-colored graph model and
degree-one-and-two encoding symbols based array BP-XOR codes. Using this
equivalence result, we are able to design general array BP-XOR codes using

scale as L_bHa^0.7 for 10^40 < L_bHa < 10^45 ergs s^-1. Following our earlier
result that L_bHa \propto L_bol, this trend indicates that the relative narrow
line luminosity decreases with increasing L_bol. We derive L_bol / 10^43 ergs
s^-1 = 4000 (L([OIII]) / 10^43 ergs s^-1)^1.39. This implies that the
bolometric correction factor, L_bol / L([OIII]), decreases from 3,000 at L_bol

narrow component dominates the observed H-alpha profile, and most type 1 AGN

explain the dominance of intermediate type AGN at low luminosity, and the most
likely mechanism is a decrease in the narrow line region covering factor with
increasing L_bol. Deviations from the above trend occur in objects with L /

also referred to as fractional integral operators. First we prove mixed
$A_p$-$A_\infty$ type estimates in the spirit of [13, 15, 17]. Then we prove
strong and weak type inequalities in the case $p<q$ using the so-called log
bump conditions. These results complement the strong type inequalities of
P\'erez [30] and answer a conjecture from [3]. For both sets of results our

with the opposite-sign gaps of s+- superconductor, leads to several anomalous
features. In the case of strong frustration a nontrivial time-reversal-symmetry
breaking (TRSB) state, with nonzero phase angles between all gap parameters, is
possible. In a more typical state, the s-wave order parameter is aligned with
one of the s+- gaps. The other (anti-aligned) gap induces negative feature in
the s-wave density of states, which can serve as a fingerprint of s+- state.
Another consequence of the frustration is an extended region in the parameter
space in which s-wave superconductivity is suppressed, despite being in contact
with nominally stronger superconductor. This negative proximity effect is
always present for the TRSB state, but extends even into the aligned states. We
study these effects within a simple microscopic model assuming dirty limit in
all bands, which allows us to model the system in terms of minimum number of

calculation is unique in that it follows a large number of cycles, thus
revealing the secular evolution of the WD system.
  We find that counter to previous studies, accretion does not give rise to
steady state burning. Instead, it produces cyclic thermonuclear runaways of two
types. During most of the evolution, many small cycles of hydrogen ignition and
burning build a helium layer over the surface of the white dwarf. This He layer
gradually thickens and progressively becomes more degenerate. Once a sufficient
amount of He has accumulated, several very large helium burning flashes take
place and expel the accreted envelope, leaving no net mass accumulation.
  The results imply that such a system will not undergo an accretion induced
collapse, nor will it lead to a SN Type Ia, unless a major new physical process
is found.

age distribution and dissolution rate of LMC star clusters. We find that the
frequency of massive clusters with masses M>5000 Msun is almost constant
between 10 and 200 Myr, showing that the influence of residual gas expulsion is
limited to the first 10 Myr of cluster evolution or clusters less massive than
5000 Msun. Comparing the cluster frequency in that interval with the absolute
star formation rate, we find that about 15% of all stars in the LMC were formed
in long-lived star clusters that survive for more than 10 Myr. We also find
that the mass function of LMC clusters younger than 1 Gyr can be fitted by a
power-law mass function with slope \alpha=-2.3, while older clusters follow a
significantly shallower slope and interpret this is a sign of the ongoing
dissolution of low-mass clusters. Our data shows that for ages older than 200
Myr, about 90% of all clusters are lost per dex of lifetime. The implied
cluster dissolution rate is significantly faster than that based on analytic
estimates and N-body simulations. Our cluster age data finally shows evidence
for a burst in cluster formation about 1 Gyr ago, but little evidence for
bursts at other ages.

from the bow shock region of runaway star BD+43$^\circ$3654
\citep{Benaglia10}.If this object exhibits typical characteristics, then
runaway star systems can contribute a non-negligible fraction of Galactic
cosmic-ray electrons. To constrain the maximum energy of accelerated particles
from measurements of possible non-thermal emissions in the X-ray band, Suzaku
observed BD+43$^\circ$3654 in April 2011 with an exposure of 99 ks. Because the
onboard instruments have a stable and low background level, Suzaku detected a
possible enhancement over the background of $7.6\pm 3.4$ cnt arcmin$^{-2}$ at
the bow shock region, where the error represents the 3 sigma statistics only.
However, the excess is not significant within the systematic errors of
non-X-ray and cosmic-ray backgrounds of the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer, which
are $\pm 6.0$ and $\pm 34$ cnt arcmin$^{-2}$, respectively, and the 3-sigma
upper limit in the X-ray luminosity from the shock region, which is $1.1 \times
10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ per 41.2 arcmin$^2$ in the 0.5 to 10 keV band. This
result leads to three conclusions: (1) a shock-heating process is inefficient
on this system; (2) the maximum energy of electrons does not exceed $\sim$ 10
TeV, corresponding to a Lorentz factor of less than $10^7$; and (3) the
magnetic field in the shock acceleration site might not be as turbulent as
those in pulsar wind nebulae and supernova remnants.

the transport process and achieve perfect fidelity with limited resources,
involving only manipulation of the end-qubits. These strategies could be thus
applied not only to engineered systems with relaxed fabrication precision, but

apply the Wannier function representation to develop a systematic

asymptotic relative angular momentum components which forms an orthogonal basis

serves both as an expansion tool for interactions and as a definition of
positive semidefinite Hamiltonians for which the ideal fractional Chern
insulator wavefunctions are exact nullspace modes. We compare the short-range
two-body pseudopotential expansion of various fractional Chern insulator models
at one-third filling in phase regimes where a Laughlin-type ground state is
expected to be realized. We also discuss the effect of inhomogeneous Berry
curvature which leads to components of the Hamiltonian that cannot be expanded
into pseudopotentials, and elaborate on their role in determining low energy
theories for fractional Chern insulators. Finally, we generalize our Chern
pseudopotential approach to interactions involving more than two bodies with
the goal of facilitating the identification of non-Abelian fractional Chern
insulators.

subclass ${\cal W}^{\ast}_k(d)$ consisting of the $(k+1)$-neighbourly members
of ${\cal W}_k(d)$. We introduce the mu-vector of any simplicial complex and
show that, in the case of 2-neighbourly simplicial complexes, the mu-vector
dominates the vector of its Betti numbers componentwise; the two vectors are
equal precisely for tight simplicial complexes. We are able to estimate/compute
certain alternating sums of the components of the mu-vector of any
2-neighbourly member of ${\cal W}_k(d)$ for $d\geq 2k$. As one consequence of
this theory, we prove a lower bound theorem for such triangulated manifolds, as
well as determine the integral homology type of members of ${\cal
W}^{\ast}_k(d)$ for $d \geq 2k+2$. As another application, we prove that, when
$d \neq 2k+1$, all members of ${\cal W}^{\ast}_k(d)$ are tight. We also
characterize the tight members of ${\cal W}^{\ast}_k(2k + 1)$ in terms of their
$k^{\rm th}$ Betti numbers. These results more or less answer a recent question
of Effenberger, and also provide a uniform and conceptual tightness proof for
all except two of the known tight triangulated manifolds.
  We also prove a lower bound theorem for triangulated manifolds in which the
members of ${\cal W}_1(d)$ provide the equality case. This generalises a result
(the $d=4$ case) due to Walkup and Kuehnel. As a consequence, it is shown that
every tight member of ${\cal W}_1(d)$ is strongly minimal, thus providing
substantial evidence in favour of a conjecture of Kuehnel and Lutz asserting
that tight triangulated manifolds should be strongly minimal.

critical, universal maximum matter density in loop quantum cosmology for the
case of a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmology with scalar
matter. The argument is based on the existence of a sharp exponential
ultraviolet cutoff in momentum space on the eigenfunctions of the quantum
cosmological dynamical evolution operator (the gravitational part of the
Hamiltonian constraint), attributable to the fundamental discreteness of
spatial volume in loop quantum cosmology. The existence of the cutoff is proved
directly from recently found exact solutions for the eigenfunctions for this
model. As a consequence, the operators corresponding to the momentum of the
scalar field and the spatial volume approximately commute. The ultraviolet
cutoff then implies that the scalar momentum, though not a bounded operator, is
in effect bounded on subspaces of constant volume, leading to the upper bound
on the expectation value of the matter density. The maximum matter density is
universal (i.e. independent of the quantum state) because of the linear scaling
of the cutoff with volume. These heuristic arguments are supplemented by a new
proof in the volume representation of the existence of the maximum matter
density. The techniques employed to demonstrate the existence of the cutoff
also allow us to extract the large volume limit of the exact eigenfunctions,
confirming earlier numerical and analytical work showing that the
eigenfunctions approach superpositions of the eigenfunctions of the
Wheeler-DeWitt quantization of the same model. We argue that generic (not just
semiclassical) quantum states approach symmetric superpositions of expanding
and contracting universes.

subsequent interaction of this dipole with the nucleon. The dipole cross

Its cloud of screening electrons, that are virtually bound to the radicals

Near-field Acoustic Holography (NAH) techniques to identify the vibrating
sources. This paper shows that, for convex homogeneous plates with arbitrary
boundary conditions, new regularization schemes can be developed, based on the
sparsity of the normal velocity of the plate in a well-designed basis, i.e. the
possibility to approximate it as a weighted sum of few elementary basis
functions. In particular, these new techniques can handle discontinuities of
the velocity field at the boundaries, which can be problematic with standard
techniques. This comes at the cost of a higher computational complexity to
solve the associated optimization problem, though it remains easily tractable
with out-of-the-box software. Furthermore, this sparsity framework allows us to
take advantage of the concept of Compressive Sampling: under some conditions on
the sampling process (here, the design of a random array, which can be
numerically and experimentally validated), it is possible to reconstruct the
sparse signals with significantly less measurements (i.e., microphones) than
classically required. After introducing the different concepts, this paper
presents numerical and experimental results of NAH with two plate geometries,
and compares the advantages and limitations of these sparsity-based techniques
over standard Tikhonov regularization.

fraction of disk bearing stars increases towards the periphery of the cluster;
2) there is an evidence supporting the notion that the mechanisms for disk

measurements, but recent observations suggest the possibility of directly
detecting the winds by observing the Doppler shift of spectral lines seen
during transit. Motivated by these observations, we show how Doppler
measurements can place powerful constraints on the meteorology. We show that
the atmospheric circulation--and Doppler signature--of hot Jupiters splits into
two regimes. Under weak stellar insolation, the day-night thermal forcing
generates fast zonal jet streams from the interaction of atmospheric waves with
the mean flow. In this regime, air along the terminator (as seen during
transit) flows toward Earth in some regions and away from Earth in others,
leading to a Doppler signature exhibiting superposed blueshifted and redshifted
components. Under intense stellar insolation, however, the strong thermal
forcing damps these planetary-scale waves, inhibiting their ability to generate
jets. Strong frictional drag likewise damps these waves and inhibits jet
formation. As a result, this second regime exhibits a circulation dominated by
high-altitude, day-to-night airflow, leading to a predominantly blueshifted
Doppler signature during transit. We present state-of-the-art circulation
models including nongray radiative transfer to quantify this regime shift and
the resulting Doppler signatures; these models suggest that cool planets like
GJ 436b lie in the first regime, HD 189733b is transitional, while planets
hotter than HD 209458b lie in the second regime. Moreover, we show how the
amplitude of the Doppler shifts constrains the strength of frictional drag in
the upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters. If due to winds, the ~2-km/sec blueshift
inferred on HD 209458b may require drag time constants as short as 10^4-10^6
seconds, possibly the result of Lorentz-force braking on this planet's hot
dayside.

  Modeling and Deployment","25 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Microwave power transfer (MPT) delivers energy wirelessly from stations
called power beacons (PBs) to mobile devices by microwave radiation. This
provides mobiles practically infinite battery lives and eliminates the need of
power cords and chargers. To enable MPT for mobile charging, this paper
proposes a new network architecture that overlays an uplink cellular network
with randomly deployed PBs for powering mobiles, called a hybrid network. The
deployment of the hybrid network under an outage constraint on data links is
investigated based on a stochastic-geometry model where single-antenna base
stations (BSs) and PBs form independent homogeneous Poisson point processes
(PPPs) and single-antenna mobiles are uniformly distributed in Voronoi cells
generated by BSs. In this model, mobiles and PBs fix their transmission power
at p and q, respectively; a PB either radiates isotropically, called isotropic
MPT, or directs energy towards target mobiles by beamforming, called directed
MPT. The model is applied to derive the tradeoffs between the network
parameters including p, q, and the BS/PB densities under the outage constraint.
First, consider the deployment of the cellular network. It is proved that the
outage constraint is satisfied so long as the product the BS density decreases
with increasing p following a power law where the exponent is proportional to
the path-loss exponent. Next, consider the deployment of the hybrid network
assuming infinite energy storage at mobiles. It is shown that for isotropic
MPT, the product between q, the PB density, and the BS density raised to a
power proportional to the path-loss exponent has to be above a given threshold
so that PBs are sufficiently dense; for directed MPT, a similar result is
obtained with the aforementioned product increased by the array gain. Last,
similar results are derived for the case of mobiles having small energy
storage.

with a possibly top-heavy stellar mass distribution. It is likely that magnetic
fields play a crucial role in the distribution of stellar masses inside
star-forming molecular clouds. In this context, we explore the effects of
magnetic fields, with a typical field strength of 38 microG, such as in RCW 38,
and a field strength of 135 microG, similar to NGC 2024 and the infrared dark
cloud G28.34+0.06, on the initial mass function (IMF) near (< 10 pc) a 10^7
solar mass black hole. Using these conditions, we perform a series of numerical
simulations with the hydrodynamical code FLASH to elucidate the impact of
magnetic fields on the IMF and the star-formation efficiency (SFE) emerging
from an 800 solar mass cloud. We find that the collapse of a gravitationally
unstable molecular cloud is slowed down with increasing magnetic field strength
and that stars form along the field lines. The total number of stars formed
during the simulations increases by a factor of 1.5-2 with magnetic fields. The
main component of the IMF has a lognormal shape, with its peak shifted to
sub-solar (< 0.3 M_sun) masses in the presence of magnetic fields, due to a
decrease in the accretion rates from the gas reservoir. In addition, we see a
top-heavy, nearly flat IMF above ~2 solar masses, from regions that were
supported by magnetic pressure until high masses are reached. We also consider
the effects of X-ray irradiation if the central black hole is active. X-ray
feedback inhibits the formation of sub-solar masses and decreases the SFEs even
further. Thus, the second contribution is no longer visible. We conclude that
magnetic fields potentially change the SFE and the IMF both in active and
inactive galaxies, and need to be taken into account in such calculations.

communicates to a destination node via N parallel relays through a cascade of a
Gaussian broadcast (BC) and a multiple access (MAC) channel. Introduced in 2000
by Schein and Gallager, the capacity of this relay network is unknown in
general. The best currently available capacity approximation, independent of
the coefficients and the SNR's of the constituent channels, is within an
additive gap of 1.3 N bits, which follows from the recent capacity
approximations for general Gaussian relay networks with arbitrary topology.
  In this paper, we approximate the capacity of this network within 2 log N
bits. We show that two strategies can be used to achieve the
information-theoretic cutset upper bound on the capacity of the network up to
an additive gap of O(log N) bits, independent of the channel configurations and
the SNR's. The first of these strategies is simple partial decode-and-forward.
Here, the source node uses a superposition codebook to broadcast independent
messages to the relays at appropriately chosen rates; each relay decodes its
intended message and then forwards it to the destination over the MAC channel.
A similar performance can be also achieved with compress-and-forward type
strategies (such as quantize-map-and-forward and noisy network coding) that
provide the 1.3 N-bit approximation for general Gaussian networks, but only if
the relays quantize their observed signals at a resolution inversely
proportional to the number of relay nodes N. This suggest that the
rule-of-thumb to quantize the received signals at the noise level in the
current literature can be highly suboptimal.

relationship between two nodes in the network. In a trust network, a
fundamental question is how to assess and compute the bias and prestige of the
nodes, where the bias of a node measures the trustworthiness of a node and the
prestige of a node measures the importance of the node. The larger bias of a
node implies the lower trustworthiness of the node, and the larger prestige of
a node implies the higher importance of the node. In this paper, we define a
vector-valued contractive function to characterize the bias vector which
results in a rich family of bias measurements, and we propose a framework of
algorithms for computing the bias and prestige of nodes in trust networks.
Based on our framework, we develop four algorithms that can calculate the bias
and prestige of nodes effectively and robustly. The time and space complexities
of all our algorithms are linear w.r.t. the size of the graph, thus our
algorithms are scalable to handle large datasets. We evaluate our algorithms

situations, in which an individual is motivated to help another to acquire a
good reputation and receive help from others afterwards. Ingroup favoritism is
another aspect of human cooperation, whereby individuals help members in their
own group more often than those in other groups. Ingroup favoritism is a puzzle
for the theory of cooperation because it is not easily evolutionarily stable.
In the context of indirect reciprocity, ingroup favoritism has been shown to be
a consequence of employing a double standard when assigning reputations to
ingroup and outgroup members; e.g., helping an ingroup member is regarded as
good, whereas the same action toward an outgroup member is regarded as bad. We
analyze a model of indirect reciprocity in which information sharing is
conducted groupwise. In our model, individuals play social dilemma games within
and across groups, and the information about their reputations is shared within
each group. We show that evolutionarily stable ingroup favoritism emerges even
if all the players use the same reputation assignment rule regardless of group
(i.e., a single standard). Two reputation assignment rules called simple
standing and stern judging yield ingroup favoritism. Stern judging induces much
stronger ingroup favoritism than does simple standing. Simple standing and
stern judging are evolutionarily stable against each other when groups
employing different assignment rules compete and the number of groups is
sufficiently large. In addition, we analytically show as a limiting case that
homogeneous populations of reciprocators that use reputations are unstable when
individuals independently infer reputations of individuals, which is consistent
with previously reported numerical results.

time-reversibility of the process. For stochastic differential equations
(SDE's) time discretization numerical schemes usually destroy the property of
time-reversibility. Despite an extensive literature on the numerical analysis
for SDE's, their stability properties, strong and/or weak error estimates,
large deviations and infinite-time estimates, no quantitative results are known
on the lack of reversibility of the discrete-time approximation process. In
this paper we provide such quantitative estimates by using the concept of
entropy production rate, inspired by ideas from non-equilibrium statistical
mechanics. The entropy production rate for a stochastic process is defined as
the relative entropy (per unit time) of the path measure of the process with
respect to the path measure of the time-reversed process. By construction the
entropy production rate is nonnegative and it vanishes if and only if the
process is reversible. Crucially, from a numerical point of view, the entropy
production rate is an {\em a posteriori} quantity, hence it can be computed in
the course of a simulation as the ergodic average of a certain functional of
the process (the so-called Gallavotti-Cohen (GC) action functional). We compute
the entropy production for various numerical schemes such as explicit
Euler-Maruyama and explicit Milstein's for reversible SDEs with additive or
multiplicative noise. Additionally, we analyze the entropy production for the
BBK integrator of the Langevin processes. We show that entropy production is an
observable that distinguishes between different numerical schemes in terms of
their discretization-induced irreversibility. Furthermore, our results show
that the type of the noise critically affects the behavior of the entropy
production rate.

field of material science. We consider a self-assembly process whose elementary
building blocks are decorated patchy colloids of various types, that
spontaneously drive the system toward a unique and predetermined targeted
macroscopic structure.
  To this aim, we discuss a simple theoretical model -- the Kern-Frenkel model
-- describing a fluid of colloidal spherical particles with a pre-defined
number and distribution of solvophobic and solvophilic regions on their
surface. The solvophobic and solvophilic regions are described via a
short-range square-well and a hard-sphere potentials, respectively.
  Integral equation and perturbation theories are presented to discuss
structural and thermodynamical properties, with particular emphasis on the
computation of the fluid-fluid (or gas-liquid) transition in the
temperature-density plane.
  The model allows the description of both one and two attractive caps, as a
function of the fraction of covered attractive surface, thus interpolating
between a square-well and a hard-sphere fluid, upon changing the coverage.
  By comparison with Monte Carlo simulations, we assess the pros and the cons
of both integral equation and perturbation theories in the present context of
patchy colloids, where the computational effort for numerical simulations is
rather demanding.

waves for a model of Schr\""odinger equation with concentrated nonlinearity in
dimension three. The nonlinearity is obtained considering a {point} (or
contact) interaction with strength $\alpha$, which consists of a singular
perturbation of the laplacian described by a selfadjoint operator $H_{\alpha}$,
where the strength $\alpha$ depends on the wavefunction: $i\dot u= H_\alpha u$,
$\alpha=\alpha(u)$. If $q$ is the so-called charge of the domain element $u$,
i.e. the coefficient of its singular part, we let the strength $\alpha$ depend
on $u$ according to the law $\alpha=-\nu|q|^\sigma$, with $\nu > 0$. This
characterizes the model as a focusing NLS with concentrated nonlinearity of
power type. For such a model we prove the existence of standing waves of the
form $u (t)=e^{i\omega t}\Phi_{\omega}$, which are orbitally stable in the
range $\sigma \in (0,1)$, and orbitally unstable for $\sigma \geq 1.$ Moreover,
we show that for $\sigma \in (0,\frac{1}{\sqrt 2})$ every standing wave is
asymptotically stable in the following sense. Choosing initial data close to
the stationary state in the energy norm, and belonging to a natural weighted
$L^p$ space which allows dispersive estimates, the following resolution holds:
$u(t) = e^{i\omega_{\infty} t} \Phi_{\omega_{\infty}} +U_t*\psi_{\infty}
+r_{\infty}, \quad \textrm{as} \;\; t \rightarrow +\infty$, where $U$ is the
free Schr\""odinger propagator, $\omega_{\infty} > 0$ and $\psi_{\infty}$,
$r_{\infty} \in L^2(\R^3)$ with $\| r_{\infty} \|_{L^2} = O(t^{-5/4}) \quad

admitted nonlinearity for which asymptotic stability of solitons is proved is
subcritical.

modal expansion of the bispectrum. The computational cost of accurate
bispectrum estimation is negligible relative to simulation evolution, so the
isotropic bispectrum can be used as a standard diagnostic whenever the power
spectrum is evaluated. As an application we measure the evolution of
gravitational and primordial dark matter bispectra in $N$-body simulations with
Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial conditions of the local, equilateral,
orthogonal and flattened shape. The results are compared to theoretical models
using a 3D visualisation, 3D shape correlations and the cumulative bispectrum
signal-to-noise, all of which can be evaluated extremely quickly. Our measured
bispectra are determined by $\mathcal{O}(50)$ coefficients, which can be used
as fitting formulae in the nonlinear regime and for non-Gaussian initial
conditions. In the nonlinear regime with $k<2h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, we find an
excellent correlation between the measured dark matter bispectrum and a simple
model based on a `constant' bispectrum plus a (nonlinear) tree-level
gravitational bispectrum. In the same range for non-Gaussian simulations, we
find an excellent correlation between the measured additional bispectrum and a
constant model plus a (nonlinear) tree-level primordial bispectrum. We
demonstrate that the constant contribution to the non-Gaussian bispectrum can
be understood as a time-shift of the constant mode in the gravitational
bispectrum, which is motivated by the one-halo model. The final amplitude of
this extra non-Gaussian constant contribution is directly related to the
initial amplitude of the constant mode in the primordial bispectrum. We also
comment on the effects of regular grid and glass initial conditions on the
bispectrum.

all infected individuals. HIV infection elicits a vigorous immune response
starting about 2-3 weeks post infection that can lower the amount of virus in
the body, but which cannot eradicate the virus. How HIV establishes a chronic
infection in the face of a strong immune response remains poorly understood. It
has been shown that HIV is able to rapidly change its proteins via mutation to
evade recognition by virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Typically,
an HIV-infected patient will generate 4-12 CTL responses specific for parts of
viral proteins called epitopes. Such CTL responses lead to strong selective
pressure to change the viral sequences encoding these epitopes so as to avoid
CTL recognition. Here we review experimental data on HIV evolution in response
to CTL pressure, mathematical models developed to explain this evolution, and
highlight problems associated with the data and previous modeling efforts. We
show that estimates of the strength of the epitope-specific CTL response depend
on the method used to fit models to experimental data and on the assumptions
made regarding how mutants are generated during infection. We illustrate that
allowing CTL responses to decay over time may improve the fit to experimental
data and provides higher estimates of the killing efficacy of HIV-specific
CTLs. We also propose a novel method for simultaneously estimating the killing
efficacy of multiple CTL populations specific for different epitopes of HIV
using stochastic simulations. Lastly, we show that current estimates of the
efficacy at which HIV-specific CTLs clear virus-infected cells can be improved
by more frequent sampling of viral sequences and by combining data on sequence
evolution with experimentally measured CTL dynamics.

superfluid state at a critical Zeeman field. We show that the nonanalyticities
of the thermodynamic functions as well as other physical quantities at the
quantum phase transition originate from the infrared singularities caused by
the gapless fermionic spectrum. The same argument applies also to the BCS-BEC
evolution in 2D fermionic superfluids with $p$- or d-wave pairing. The
superfluid density $n_s$ and the velocity of the Goldstone sound mode $c_s$
behave oppositely in the normal and the topological superfluid phases: they are
suppressed by the Zeeman field in the normal superfluid phase, but get enhanced
in the topological superfluid phase. The velocity of the Goldstone sound mode
also shows nonanalyticity at the quantum phase transition. For large Zeeman

$n$ is the total fermion density and $\upsilon_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi velocity

refining the size of the measurement area (here 10 cm \times 10 cm are

higher value can be observed intuitively. Finally, the fundamental diagrams of

fundamental diagrams of the two branches match well. However, the velocities in

the same densities. After the merging, the specific flow increases with the

\lambda-extendible properties of graphs as a generalization of the property of
being bipartite. They showed that for any 0<\lambda<1 and \lambda-extendible
property \Pi, any connected graph G on n vertices and m edges contains a
subgraph H \in {\Pi} with at least \lambda m+ (1-\lambda)/2 (n-1) edges. The
property of being bipartite is 1/2-extendible, and thus this bound generalizes
the Edwards-Erd\H{o}s bound for Max-Cut.
  We define a variant, namely strong \lambda-extendibility, to which the bound
applies. For a strongly \lambda-extendible graph property \Pi, we define the
parameterized Above Poljak- Turz\'ik (APT) (\Pi) problem as follows: Given a
connected graph G on n vertices and m edges and an integer parameter k, does
there exist a spanning subgraph H of G such that H \in {\Pi} and H has at least
\lambda m + (1-\lambda)/2 (n - 1) + k edges? The parameter is k, the surplus
over the number of edges guaranteed by the Poljak-Turz\'ik bound.
  We consider properties {\Pi} for which APT (\Pi) is fixed- parameter
tractable (FPT) on graphs which are O(k) vertices away from being a graph in
which each block is a clique. We show that for all such properties, APT (\Pi)
is FPT for all 0<\lambda<1. Our results hold for properties of oriented graphs
and graphs with edge labels. Our results generalize the result of Crowston et
al. (ICALP 2012) on Max-Cut parameterized above the Edwards-Erd\H{o}s bound,
and yield FPT algorithms for several graph problems parameterized above lower
bounds, e.g., Max q-Colorable Subgraph problem. Our results also imply that the
parameterized above-guarantee Oriented Max Acyclic Digraph problem is FPT, thus
solving an open question of Raman and Saurabh (Theor. Comput. Sci. 2006).

  of Botany",,,,"q-bio.TO physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Zinc uptake in roots is believed to be mediated by ZIP (ZRT-, IRT-like
Proteins) transporters. Once inside the symplast, zinc is transported to the
pericycle, where it exits by means of HMA (Heavy Metal ATPase) transporters.
The combination of symplastic transport and spatial separation of influx and
efflux produces a pattern in which zinc accumulates in the pericycle. Here,
mathematical modelling was employed to study the importance of ZIP regulation,
HMA abundance and symplastic transport in creation of the radial pattern of
zinc in primary roots of Arabidopsis thaliana.
  A comprehensive one-dimensional dynamic model of radial zinc transport in
roots was developed and used to conduct simulations. The model accounts for the
structure of the root consisting of symplast and apoplast and includes effects
of water flow, diffusion, and cross-membrane transport via transporters. It
also incorporates the radial geometry and varying porosity of root tissues, as
well as regulation of ZIP transporters.
  Steady state patterns were calculated for various zinc concentrations in the
medium, water influx and HMA abundance. The experimentally observed zinc
gradient was reproduced very well. Increase of HMA or decrease in water influx
led to loss of the gradient. The dynamic behaviour for a change in medium
concentration and water influx was also simulated showing short adaptation
times in the range of seconds to minutes. Slowing down regulation led to
oscillations in expression levels, suggesting the need for rapid regulation and
existence of buffering agents.
  The model captures the experimental findings very well and confirms the
hypothesis that low abundance of HMA4 produces a radial gradient in zinc
concentration. Surprisingly, transpiration was found to be also a key
parameter. The model suggests that ZIP regulation takes place on a comparable
time scale as symplastic transport.

difference between the network obtained considering publicly exchanged messages

the network is very homogeneous, in the sense that each individual interacts in

the edges, and a subset of nodes T, find (if it exists) a spanning connected
subgraph H of minimum cost such that every node in T has odd degree and every
node not in T has even degree; H may have multiple copies of any edge of G. Two
well-known special cases are the TSP (|T| = 0) and the s-t path TSP (|T| = 2).
Recently, An, Kleinberg, and Shmoys [STOC 2012] improved on the long-standing
5/3-approximation guarantee for the latter problem and presented an algorithm
based on LP rounding that achieves an approximation guarantee of (1+sqrt(5))/2

  We show that the methods of An et al. extend to the minimum-cost connected
T-join problem. They presented a new proof for a 5/3-approximation guarantee
for the s-t path TSP; their proof extends easily to the minimum-cost connected
T-join problem. Next, we improve on the approximation guarantee of 5/3 by
extending their LP-rounding algorithm to get an approximation guarantee of 13/8

  Finally, we focus on the prize-collecting version of the problem, and present
a primal-dual algorithm that is ""Lagrangian multiplier preserving"" and that
achieves an approximation guarantee 3 - 2/(|T|-1) when |T| >= 4. Our
primal-dual algorithm is a generalization of the known primal-dual
2-approximation for the prize-collecting s-t path TSP. Furthermore, we show
that our analysis is tight by presenting instances with |T| >= 4 such that the
cost of the solution found by the algorithm is exactly 3 - 2/(|T|-1) times the
cost of the constructed dual solution.

report transient anomalous diffusion (subdiffusion) which converges back to a
Brownian motion with reduced diffusion coefficient at long times, after the

considered the macroscopic limit of transient anomalous diffusion. On the other
hand, membranes are also heterogeneous media in which Brownian motion may be
locally slowed-down due to variations in lipid composition. Here, we
investigate whether both situations lead to a similar behavior for the
reversible ligand-binding reaction in 2d. We compare the (long-time)
equilibrium properties obtained with transient anomalous diffusion due to
obstacle hindrance or power-law distributed residence times (continuous-time
random walks) to those obtained with space-dependent slowed-down Brownian
motion. Using theoretical arguments and Monte-Carlo simulations, we show that
those three scenarios have distinctive effects on the apparent affinity of the
reaction. While continuous-time random walks decrease the apparent affinity of
the reaction, locally slowed-down Brownian motion and local hinderance by
obstacles both improve it. However, only in the case of slowed-down Brownian
motion, the affinity is maximal when the slowdown is restricted to a subregion
of the available space. Hence, even at long times (equilibrium), these
processes are different and exhibit irreconcilable behaviors when the area
fraction of reduced mobility changes.

however to be shielded from the deleterious effects of the environment. While
dynamical decoupling techniques can improve the coherence time, they impose a
compromise between sensitivity and bandwidth, since to higher decoupling power
correspond higher frequencies of the field to be measured. Moreover, the
performance of pulse sequences is ultimately limited by control bounds and
errors. Here we analyze a versatile alternative based on continuous driving. We
find that continuous dynamical decoupling schemes can be used for AC
magnetometry, providing similar frequency constraints on the AC field and
improved sensitivity for some noise regimes. In addition, the exibility of

gauge fixings or the introduction matter fields in terms of which the theory is
deparameterized. The resulting theories have true Hamiltonians for their
evolution that usually involve square roots, and this poses certain challenges
for their implementation as self-adjoint quantum operators. We show in the
context of a simple model of totally constrained theory that one can introduce
related, well defined operators that reproduce semiclassically the same physics
as the original ones, at least for states peaked in the regions of phase space
where their associated classical quantities are well defined.

luminosity distribution appears to be log-normal in form. We investigate some
of the consequences that occur when one applies this functional form to
populations of pulsars in globular clusters. We use Bayesian methods to explore
constraints on the mean and standard deviation of the luminosity function, as
well as the total number of pulsars, given an observed sample of pulsars down
to some limiting flux density, accounting for measurements of flux densities of
individual pulsars as well as diffuse emission from the direction of the
cluster. We apply our analysis to Terzan 5, 47 Tucanae and M 28, and
demonstrate, under reasonable assumptions, that the number of potentially
observable pulsars should be within 95% credible intervals of
$147^{+112}_{-65}$, $83^{+54}_{-35}$ and $100^{+91}_{-52}$, respectively.
Beaming considerations would increase the true population size by approximately
a factor of two. Using non-informative priors, however, the constraints are not
tight due to the paucity and quality of flux density measurements. Future
cluster pulsar discoveries and improved flux density measurements would allow
this method to be used to more accurately constrain the luminosity function,
and to compare the luminosity function between different clusters.

a temporary network without the use of any existing network infrastructure or
centralized administration. A cognitive radio is a radio that can change its
transmitter parameters based on interaction with the environment in which it
operates. The basic idea of cognitive radio networks is that the unlicensed
devices (cognitive radio users or secondary users) need to vacate the spectrum
band once the licensed device (primary user) is detected. Cognitive capability
and reconfigurability are the key characteristics of cognitive radio. Routing
is an important issue in Mobile Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (MCRAHNs). In
this paper, a survey of routing protocols for mobile cognitive radio ad

allow us to investigate the magnetic field and velocity in and around UDs at a
resolution approaching 0.13"". From the analysis of 339 UDs, we draw the
following conclusions: (1)UDs show clear hints of upflows, as predicted by
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. By contrast, we could not find
systematic downflow signals. Only in very deep layers we detect localized
downflows around UDs, but they do not persist in time. (2) We confirm that UDs
exhibit weaker and more inclined fields than their surroundings, as reported
previously. However, UDs that have strong fields above 2000 G or are in the
decay phase show enhanced and more vertical fields. (3)There are enhanced
fields at the migration front of UDs detached from penumbral grains, as if
their motion were impeded by the ambient field. (4) Long-lived UDs travel
longer distances with slower proper motions. Our results appear to confirm some
aspects of recent numerical simulations of magnetoconvection in the umbra
(e.g., the existence of upflows in UDs), but not others (e.g., the systematic
weakening of the magnetic field at the position of UDs.)

high-resolution, high-quality spectra of early-type nearby stars located in the
southern hemisphere at an average distance of 300 pc. Equivalent widths of the
two DIBs were determined by means of a realistic continuum fitting and
synthetic atmospheric transmissions. For all stars that possess a precise
measurement of their color excess, we compare the DIBs and the extinction. We
find average linear relationships of the DIBS and the color excess that agree
well with those of a previous survey of northern hemisphere stars closer than
550 pc. This similarity shows that there is no significant spatial dependence
of the average relationship in the solar neighborhood within $\simeq$ 600 pc. A
noticeably different result is our higher degree of correlation of the two DIBs
with the extinction. We demonstrate that it is simply due to the lower
temperature and intrinsic luminosity of our targets. Using cooler target stars
reduces the number of outliers, especially for nearby stars, confirming that
the radiation field of UV bright stars has a significant influence on the DIB
strength. We have used the cleanest data to compute updated DIB shapes.

produced by interactions of cosmic-rays (CRs) and interstellar gas in those

agree well with that predicted from direct CR observations at the Earth, the
measured emissivities from 250 MeV to 10 GeV indicate a variation of the CR
density by ~20% in the neighborhood of the solar system, even if we consider
systematic uncertainties. The molecular mass calibrating ratio, Xco =
