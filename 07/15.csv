introducing uncertainties on the design parameters and formulating the
resulting reliable design problem as a multiobjective optimization problem.
Uncertainties are modelled through evidence theory and the belief, or
credibility, in the successful achievement of mission goals is maximised along
with the reliability of constraint satisfaction. The multiobjective
optimisation problem is solved through a novel algorithm based on the
collaboration of a population of agents in search for the set of highly
reliable solutions. Two typical problems in mission analysis are used to
illustrate the proposed methodology.

  Learning Research",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) approximates a non-negative matrix
$X$ by a product of two non-negative low-rank factor matrices $W$ and $H$. NMF
and its extensions minimize either the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the
Euclidean distance between $X$ and $W^T H$ to model the Poisson noise or the
Gaussian noise. In practice, when the noise distribution is heavy tailed, they
cannot perform well. This paper presents Manhattan NMF (MahNMF) which minimizes
the Manhattan distance between $X$ and $W^T H$ for modeling the heavy tailed
Laplacian noise. Similar to sparse and low-rank matrix decompositions, MahNMF
robustly estimates the low-rank part and the sparse part of a non-negative
matrix and thus performs effectively when data are contaminated by outliers. We
extend MahNMF for various practical applications by developing box-constrained
MahNMF, manifold regularized MahNMF, group sparse MahNMF, elastic net inducing
MahNMF, and symmetric MahNMF. The major contribution of this paper lies in two
fast optimization algorithms for MahNMF and its extensions: the rank-one
residual iteration (RRI) method and Nesterov's smoothing method. In particular,
by approximating the residual matrix by the outer product of one row of W and
one row of $H$ in MahNMF, we develop an RRI method to iteratively update each
variable of $W$ and $H$ in a closed form solution. Although RRI is efficient
for small scale MahNMF and some of its extensions, it is neither scalable to
large scale matrices nor flexible enough to optimize all MahNMF extensions.
Since the objective functions of MahNMF and its extensions are neither convex
nor smooth, we apply Nesterov's smoothing method to recursively optimize one
factor matrix with another matrix fixed. By setting the smoothing parameter
inversely proportional to the iteration number, we improve the approximation
accuracy iteratively for both MahNMF and its extensions.

its parent extension where fields are still defined on AdS or conformal space

the target space. In this way, a manifestly local and o(d,2)-covariant

of the condensate. The 1D regime contains an inflection point in the dispersion
relation, which should decrease the superfluid critical velocity according to
the Landau criterion. The inflection point also represents a minimum in the

The 3D-1D transition also results in an increase in the lifetime of the

In addition, the static structure factor is measured in the long-wavelength

integration, based on a bilingual architecture that combines ML and Scala. The
overall aim is to connect LCF-style provers like Isabelle (or Coq or HOL) with
sophisticated front-end technology on the JVM platform, overcoming command-line
interaction at last.
  The present system description specifically covers Isabelle/jEdit as part of
the official release of Isabelle2011-1 (October 2011). It is a concrete Prover
IDE implementation based on Isabelle/PIDE library modules (implemented in
Scala) on the one hand, and the well-known text editor framework of jEdit
(implemented in Java) on the other hand.
  The interaction model of our Prover IDE follows the idea of continuous proof
checking: the theory source text is annotated by semantic information by the
prover as it becomes available incrementally. This works via an asynchronous
protocol that neither blocks the editor nor stops the prover from exploiting
parallelism on multi-core hardware. The jEdit GUI provides standard metaphors
for augmented text editing (highlighting, squiggles, tooltips, hyperlinks etc.)
that we have instrumented to render the formal content from the prover context.
Further refinement of the jEdit display engine via suitable plugins and fonts
approximates mathematical rendering in the text buffer, including symbols from
the TeX repertoire, and sub-/superscripts.
  Isabelle/jEdit is presented here both as a usable interface for current
Isabelle, and as a reference application to inspire further projects based on
PIDE.

networks in the presence of Rayleigh fading. It is assumed that the system uses
a capacity-approaching code (e.g., turbo or LDPC) and noncoherent binary
continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) modulation. By using
transmission capacity as the performance metric, the number of hopping
channels, CPFSK modulation index, and code rate are jointly optimized. Mobiles
in the network are assumed to be uniformly located within a finite area.
Closed-form expressions for outage probability are given for a network
characterized by a physical interference channel. The outage probability is
first found conditioned on the locations of the mobiles, and then averaged over
the spatial distribution of the mobiles. The transmission capacity, which is a
measure of the spatial spectral efficiency, is obtained from the outage
probability. The transmission capacity is modified to account for the
constraints of the CPFSK modulation and capacity-approaching coding. Two
optimization methods are proposed for maximizing the transmission capacity. The
first is a brute-force method and the second is a gradient-search algorithm.
The results obtained from the optimization shed new insight into the
fundamental tradeoffs among the number of frequency-hopping channels, the
modulation index, and the rate of the error-correcting code.

we find that the presence of gas in the early phases has important effects on

analysis of network behaviour, which has largely been studied by numerical
simulation. This can lead to difficult problems of parameter determination.
However, molecular networks give rise, through mass-action kinetics, to
polynomial dynamical systems, whose steady states are zeros of a set of
polynomial equations. These equations may be analysed by algebraic methods, in
which parameters are treated as symbolic expressions whose numerical values do
not have to be known in advance. For instance, an ""invariant"" of a network is a
polynomial expression on selected state variables that vanishes in any steady
state. Invariants have been found that encode key network properties and that
discriminate between different network structures. Although invariants may be
calculated by computational algebraic methods, such as Gr\""obner bases, these
become computationally infeasible for biologically realistic networks. Here, we
exploit Chemical Reaction Network Theory (CRNT) to develop an efficient
procedure for calculating invariants that are linear combinations of
""complexes"", or the monomials coming from mass action. We show how this
procedure can be used in proving earlier results of Horn and Jackson and of
Shinar and Feinberg for networks of deficiency at most one. We then apply our

whose networks have deficiencies up to four. We show that bifunctionality leads

therefore reveal hints of the origin of these particles. At the South Pole, the
IceCube Neutrino Observatory is capable of measuring two components of cosmic
ray air showers in coincidence: the electromagnetic component at high altitude
(2835 m) using the IceTop surface array, and the muonic component above ~1 TeV
using the IceCube array. This unique detector arrangement provides an
opportunity for precision measurements of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and
composition in the region of the knee and beyond. We present the results of a

respect to stochastic dependence. It compares two alternative notions of
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) available in the current literature. These
notions are both based on the conditional distribution of a random variable Y
given a stress event for a random variable X, but they use different types of
stress events. We derive representations of these alternative CoVaR notions in
terms of copulas, study their general dependence consistency and compare their
performance in several stochastic models. Our central finding is that
conditioning on X>=VaR_\alpha(X) gives a much better response to dependence
between X and Y than conditioning on X=VaR_\alpha(X). We prove general results
that relate the dependence consistency of CoVaR using conditioning on
X>=VaR_\alpha(X) to well established results on concordance ordering of
multivariate distributions or their copulas. These results also apply to some
other systemic risk measures, such as the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and
the Systemic Impact Index (SII). We provide counterexamples showing that CoVaR
based on the stress event X=VaR_\alpha(X) is not dependence consistent. In
particular, if (X,Y) is bivariate normal, then CoVaR based on X=VaR_\alpha(X)
is not an increasing function of the correlation parameter. Similar issues
arise in the bivariate t model and in the model with t margins and a Gumbel
copula. In all these cases, CoVaR based on X>=VaR_\alpha(X) is an increasing
function of the dependence parameter.

macromolecules, which can be modeled by Cayley trees and Vicsek fractals,
respectively. In this paper, we study the trapping problem in Cayley trees and
Vicsek fractals with different underlying geometries, focusing on a particular
case with a perfect trap located at the central node. For both networks, we
derive the exact analytic formulas in terms of the network size for the average
trapping time (ATT)---the average of node-to-trap mean first-passage time over
the whole networks. The obtained closed-form solutions show that for both
Cayley trees and Vicsek fractals, the ATT display quite different scalings with
various system sizes, which implies that the underlying structure plays a key
role on the efficiency of trapping in polymer networks. Moreover, the
dissimilar scalings of ATT may allow to differentiate readily between
dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers.

behaviour of $h$ as a function of the academic age $A_A$ for about 1400 Italian
physicists, with career lengths spanning from 3 to 46 years. The individual
$h$-index is strongly correlated with the square root of the total citations
$N_C$: $h \approx 0.53 \sqrt{N_C}$. For academic ages ranging from 12 to 24
years, the distribution of the time scaled index $h/\sqrt{A_A}$ is
approximately time-independent and it is well described by the Gompertz
function. The time scaled index $h/\sqrt{A_A}$ has an average approximately
equal to 3.8 and a standard deviation approximately equal to 1.6. Finally, the
time scaled index $h/\sqrt{A_A}$ appears to be strongly correlated with the
contemporary $h$-index $h_c$.

reconstructing the operators of quantum devices of growing sophistication. We
describe a novel tomographic procedure using coherent states which begins by
reconstructing the diagonals of the operator, and then each successive
off-diagonal in a recursive manner. Each recursion is considerably more
efficient than reconstructing the operator in its entirety, and each successive
recursion involves fewer parameters. We apply our technique to reconstruct the

corresponding microchemistry was determined by obtaining EDS measurements at
specific regions of the samples. Mapping was obtained in order to investigate
atomic distribution in microstructure. Moreover, to ensure the associations

orbit of the L-shaped translation surface tiled by three squares under the
Teichm\""uller geodesic flow. These surfaces are real algebraic curves with
three real components. We are interested in describing these surfaces by their
period matrices. We show that the only Riemann surface in that family admitting
a non-hyperelliptic automorphism comes from the 3-square-tiled translation
surface itself. This makes the computation of an exact expression for period
matrices of other Riemann surfaces in that family by the classical method
impossible. We nevertheless give the solution to the Schottky problem for that
family: we exhibit explicit necessary and sufficient conditions for a Riemann
matrix to be a period matrix of a Riemann surface in the family, involving the
vanishing of a genus 3 theta characteristic on a family of double covers.

The model describes systems of particles subject to alignment interaction and
short-range repulsion. It consists of a non-conservative hyperbolic system for
the density and velocity orientation. Short-range repulsion is included through
a singular pressure which becomes infinite at the jamming density. The singular
limit of infinite pressure stiffness leads to phase transitions from
compressible to incompressible dynamics. The paper proposes an
Asymptotic-Preserving scheme which takes care of the singular pressure while
preventing the breakdown of the CFL stability condition near congestion. It
relies on a relaxation approximation of the system and an elliptic formulation
of the pressure equation. Numerical simulations of impinging clusters show the
efficiency of the scheme to treat congestions. A two-fluid variant of the model
provides a model of path formation in crowds.

polynomial time approximation schemes (PTAS's) for a wide class of scheduling
problems on uniformly related machines. This class includes (among others)
minimizing the makespan, maximizing the minimum load, and minimizing the l_p
norm of the machine loads vector. Previously, this kind of result was only
known for the makespan objective. Monotone algorithms have the property that an
increase in the speed of a machine cannot decrease the amount of work assigned
to it. The key idea of our novel method is to show that for goal functions that
are sufficiently well-behaved functions of the machine loads, it is possible to
compute in polynomial time a highly structured nearly optimal schedule.
Monotone approximation schemes have an important role in the emerging area of
algorithmic mechanism design. In the game-theoretical setting of these
scheduling problems there is a social goal, which is one of the objective
functions that we study. Each machine is controlled by a selfish
single-parameter agent, where its private information is its cost of processing
a unit sized job, which is also the inverse of the speed of its machine. Each
agent wishes to maximize its own profit, defined as the payment it receives
from the mechanism minus its cost for processing all jobs assigned to it, and
places a bid which corresponds to its private information. For each one of the
problems, we show that we can calculate payments that guarantee truthfulness in
an efficient manner. Thus, there exists a dominant strategy where agents report
their true speeds, and we show the existence of a truthful mechanism which can
be implemented in polynomial time, where the social goal is approximated within
a factor of 1+epsilon for every epsilon>0.

general grounds that hard short distance scattering processes are highly
suppressed for center of mass scattering energies beyond the fundamental Planck

non-perturbative quantum gravity effects could be manifest as an extinction of
high transverse momentum jets at the LHC. To model these effects we implement
an Extinction Monte Carlo modification of the Pythia event generator based on a
large damping Veneziano form factor modification of hard QCD scattering
processes. Using this we illustrate the leading effects of extinction on the
inclusive jet transverse momentum spectrum at the LHC. We estimate that an
extinction mass scale of up to roughly half the center of mass beam collision
energy could be probed with high statistics data.

quantum systems is one of the key unsolved problems in quantum physics. While
small quantum systems with discrete energy levels are noiseless and stay
coherent forever in the absence of any coupling to external world, most
large-scale quantum systems are able to produce thermal bath and excitation
decay. This intrinsic decoherence is manifested by a broadening of energy
levels which aquire a finite width. The important question is what is the
driving force and the mechanism of transition(s) between two different types of
many-body systems - with and without intrinsic decoherence? Here we address
this question via the numerical study of energy level statistics of a system of
spins-1/2 with anisotropic exchange interactions and random transverse fields.
Our results present the first evidence for a well-defined quantum phase
transition between domains of discrete and continous many-body spectra in a
class of random spin models. Because this model also describes the physics of
the superconductor-insulator transition in disordered superconductors like InO
and similar materials, our results imply the appearance of novel insulating
phases in the vicinity of this transition.
