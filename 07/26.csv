symmetric pairs for involutive automorphism of the second kind of symmetrizable
Kac-Moody algebras. The resulting quantum symmetric pairs are right coideal
subalgebras of quantized enveloping algebras. They give rise to triangular
decompositions, including a quantum analog of the Iwasawa decomposition, and
they can be written explicitly in terms of generators and relations. Moreover,
their centers and their specializations are determined. The constructions
follow G. Letzter's theory of quantum symmetric pairs for semisimple Lie
algebras. The main additional ingredient is the classification of involutive
automorphisms of the second kind of symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebras due to Kac
and Wang. The resulting theory comprises various classes of examples which have
previously appeared in the literature, such as q-Onsager algebras and the
twisted q-Yangians introduced by Molev, Ragoucy, and Sorba.

  Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering, pp. 385-391, 2011",,,"cs.IR cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe
content within Web 2.0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a
hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies enable end-users to freely
create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some
content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and
ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than
increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms,
homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they
introduce. To address this issue, a variety of approaches have been proposed
that recommend users what tags to use, both when labelling and when looking for
resources.
  As we illustrate in this paper, real world folksonomies are characterized by
power law distributions of tags, over which commonly used similarity metrics,
including the Jaccard coefficient and the cosine similarity, fail to compute.
We thus propose a novel metric, specifically developed to capture similarity in
large-scale folksonomies, that is based on a mutual reinforcement principle:
that is, two tags are deemed similar if they have been associated to similar
resources, and vice-versa two resources are deemed similar if they have been
labelled by similar tags. We offer an efficient realisation of this similarity
metric, and assess its quality experimentally, by comparing it against cosine
similarity, on three large-scale datasets, namely Bibsonomy, MovieLens and
CiteULike.

most general sense) by groups of users, who cooperate for achieving a common
goal. Collaboration is a fundamental assumption and requirement for the correct
operation of many communication systems. The main challenge when creating
collaborative systems in a decentralized manner is dealing with the fact that
users may behave in selfish ways, trying to obtain the benefits of the tasks
but without participating in their execution. In this context, Game Theory has
been instrumental to model collaborative systems and the task allocation
problem, and to design mechanisms for optimal allocation of tasks. In this
paper, we revise the classical assumptions and propose a new approach to this
problem. First, we establish a system model based on heterogenous nodes (users,
players), and propose a basic distributed mechanism so that, when a new task
appears, it is assigned to the most suitable node. The classical technique for
compensating a node that executes a task is the use of payments (which in most
networks are hard or impossible to implement). Instead, we propose a
distributed mechanism for the optimal allocation of tasks without payments. We
prove this mechanism to be robust event in the presence of independent selfish
or rationally limited players. Additionally, our model is based on very weak
assumptions, which makes the proposed mechanisms susceptible to be implemented
in networked systems (e.g., the Internet).

which are not accounted for in a polytropic EOS model. Variation of the plasma

gamma-ray source in the Milky Way Galactic Center that is consistent with a
spatially extended signal using about 4 years of Fermi-LAT data. The gamma-ray
flux is consistent with annihilation of dark matter particles with a thermal
annihilation cross-section if the spatial distribution of dark matter particles
is similar to the predictions of dark matter only simulations. We find
statistically significant detections of an extended source with gamma-ray
spectrum that is consistent with dark matter particle masses of approximately
10 GeV to 1 TeV annihilating to b/b-bar quarks, and masses approximately 10 GeV
to 30 GeV annihilating to tau+ tau- leptons. However, a part of the allowed
region in this interpretation is in conflict with constraints from Fermi
observations of the Milky Way satellites. The biggest improvement over the fit
including just the point sources is obtained for a 30 GeV dark matter particle
annihilating to b/b-bar quarks. The gamma-ray intensity and spectrum are also
well fit with emission from a millisecond pulsar (MSP) population following a
density profile like that of low-mass X-ray binaries observed in M31. The
greatest goodness-of-fit of the extended emission is with spectra consistent
with known astrophysical sources like MSPs in globular clusters or cosmic ray
bremsstrahlung on molecular gas. Therefore, we conclude that the bulk of the
emission is likely from an unresolved or spatially extended astrophysical
source. However, the interesting possibility of all or part of the extended
emission being from dark matter annihilation cannot be excluded at present.

Schwarzschild de Sitter spacetimes we attend to the cosmological region of
spacetime which is bounded in the past by cosmological horizons and to the
future by a spacelike hypersurface at infinity. We prove an energy estimate
capturing the expansion of that region which combined with earlier results for
the static region yields a global boundedness result for linear waves. It
asserts that a general finite energy solution to the global initial value
problem has a limit on the future boundary at infinity that can be viewed as a
function on the standard cylinder with finite energy, and that moreover any
decay along the cosmological horizon is inherited along the future boundary. In
particular, we exhibit an explicit nonvanishing quantity on the future boundary
of the spacetime consistent with our expectations for the nonlinear stability
problem. Our results apply to a large class of expanding cosmologies near the
Schwarzschild de Sitter geometry, in particular subextremal Kerr de Sitter
spacetimes.

approximately vertically, travel times measured from surface pairs for these
large separations are mostly sensitive to vertical flows, at least for shallow
flows within a few Mm of the solar surface. All previous analyses of
supergranulation have used smaller separations and have been hampered by the
difficulty of separating the horizontal and vertical flow components. We find
that the large separation travel times associated with supergranulation cannot
be studied using the standard phase-speed filters of time-distance
helioseismology. These filters, whose use is based upon a refractive model of
the perturbations, reduce the resultant travel time signal by at least an order
of magnitude at some distances. More effective filters are derived. Modeling
suggests that the center--annulus travel time difference $[\delta t_{\rm{oi}}]$
in the separation range $\Delta=10$\,-\,$24 ^\circ$ is insensitive to the
horizontally diverging flow from the centers of the supergranules and should
lead to a constant signal from the vertical flow. Our measurement of this
quantity, $5.1 \pm 0.1\secs$, is constant over the distance range. This
magnitude of signal cannot be caused by the level of upflow at cell centers
seen at the photosphere of $10\ms$ extended in depth. It requires the vertical

two-sample and independence testing: on the one hand, the energy distances and
distance covariances from the statistics literature; on the other, maximum mean
discrepancies (MMD), that is, distances between embeddings of distributions to
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), as established in machine learning.
In the case where the energy distance is computed with a semimetric of negative
type, a positive definite kernel, termed distance kernel, may be defined such
that the MMD corresponds exactly to the energy distance. Conversely, for any
positive definite kernel, we can interpret the MMD as energy distance with
respect to some negative-type semimetric. This equivalence readily extends to
distance covariance using kernels on the product space. We determine the class
of probability distributions for which the test statistics are consistent
against all alternatives. Finally, we investigate the performance of the family
of distance kernels in two-sample and independence tests: we show in particular
that the energy distance most commonly employed in statistics is just one
member of a parametric family of kernels, and that other choices from this
family can yield more powerful tests.

  The main features of CalcHEP are the computation of Feynman diagrams,
integration over multi-particle phase space and event simulation at parton
level. The principle attractive key-points along these lines are that it has:
a) an easy startup even for those who are not familiar with CalcHEP; b) a
friendly and convenient graphical user interface; c) the option for a user to
easily modify a model or introduce a new model by either using the graphical
interface or by using an external package with the possibility of cross
checking the results in different gauges; d) a batch interface which allows to
perform very complicated and tedious calculations connecting production and
decay modes for processes with many particles in the final state.
  With this features set, CalcHEP can efficiently perform calculations with a
high level of automation from a theory in the form of a Lagrangian down to
phenomenology in the form of cross sections, parton level event simulation and
various kinematical distributions.

formulated and solved in a number of relevant scenarios. In this class of
models, actions are taken at encoders or decoders, either to acquire side
information in an efficient way or to control or probe effectively the channel
state. In this paper, the problem of embedding information on the actions is
studied for both the source and the channel coding set-ups. In both cases, a
decoder is present that observes only a function of the actions taken by an
encoder or a decoder of an action-dependent point-to-point link. For the source
coding model, this decoder wishes to reconstruct a lossy version of the source
being transmitted over the point-to-point link, while for the channel coding
problem the decoder wishes to retrieve a portion of the message conveyed over
the link. For the problem of source coding with actions taken at the decoder, a
single letter characterization of the set of all achievable tuples of rate,
distortions at the two decoders and action cost is derived, under the
assumption that the mentioned decoder observes a function of the actions
non-causally, strictly causally or causally. A special case of the problem in
which the actions are taken by the encoder is also solved. A single-letter
characterization of the achievable capacity-cost region is then obtained for
the channel coding set-up with actions. Examples are provided that shed light
into the effect of information embedding on the actions for the
action-dependent source and channel coding problems.

accretion disks. Using the PLUTO code we solve the time-dependent resistive MHD
equations taking into account the disk and jet evolution simultaneously. The
main question we address is which kind of disks do launch jets and which kind
of disks do not? In particular, we study how the magnitude and distribution of
the (turbulent) magnetic diffusivity affect mass loading and jet acceleration.
We have applied a turbulent magnetic diffusivity based on \alpha-prescription,
but have also investigate examples where the scale height of diffusivity is
larger than that of the disk gas pressure. We further investigate how the
ejection efficiency is governed by the magnetic field strength. Our simulations
last for up to 5000 dynamical time scales corresponding to 900 orbital periods
of the inner disk. As a general result we observe a continuous and robust
outflow launched from the inner part of the disk, expanding into a collimated
jet of super fast magneto-sonic speed. For long time scales the disk internal
dynamics changes, as due to outflow ejection and disk accretion the disk mass
decreases. For magneto-centrifugally driven jets we find that for i) less
diffusive disks, ii) a stronger magnetic field, iii) a low poloidal
diffusivity, or a iv) lower numerical diffusivity (resolution), the mass
loading of the outflow is increased - resulting in more powerful jets with high
mass flux. For weak magnetization the (weak) outflow is driven by the magnetic
pressure gradient. We further investigate the jet asymptotic velocity and the
jet rotational velocity in respect of the different launching scenarios. We
find a lower degree of jet collimation than previous studies, most probably due
to our revised outflow boundary condition.

their own measurement, their demand and a partial statistical channel state
information (CSI) of other users. In particular, we investigate the properties
of a Stackelberg game, in which the base station is a player on its own. We
derive analytically the utilities related to the channel quality perceived by
users to obtain the equilibria. We study the Price of Anarchy (PoA) of such
system, where the PoA is the ratio of the social welfare attained when a
network planner chooses policies to maximize social welfare versus the social
welfare attained in Nash/Stackeleberg equilibrium when users choose their
policies strategically. We show by means of a Stackelberg formulation, how the
operator, by sending appropriate information about the state of the channel,
can configure a dynamic offset that optimizes its global utility while users
maximize their individual utilities. The proposed hierarchical decision
approach for wireless networks can reach a good trade-off between the global
network performance at the equilibrium and the requested amount of signaling.
Typically, it is shown that when the network goal is orthogonal to user's goal,
this can lead the users to a misleading association problem.

overlapping the latter with a coherent state at a beam splitter, and subsequent
photon-number resolved detection. This setup allows a complete test of
nonclassicality of an arbitrary quantum state. The role of the quantum
efficiency as well as statistical and systematic uncertainties are discussed.
Finally, the scheme is demonstrated for a realistic example.

In order to calculate the dielectric function, first, using hybrid density
functional wavefunctions we have added GW corrections on top of the hybrid
density functional calculations and we solved the so-called Bethe Salpeter
equation to include effects of correlations of the electron-hole pair created
upon photon absorption. We find that the effects of electron correlations are
very important and they show up as a strong contribution of the electron-hole

electron/hole pair excitation on top of the interacting group state.

large number of resonance ground-state absorption lines (e.g., CII, MgII, AlII,

fine-structure levels of FeII. Time-varying absorption from a highly excited

clear evidence of ionization by the GRB, which is for the first time

densities at each epoch of observations by fitting absorption lines with a
four-component Voigt-profile model. We perform CLOUDY photo-ionization

10^12 Msun are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon
conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z ~ 2.5 (consistent
with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected
to be significant out to at least z ~ 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low
redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous
expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we
provide new fitting formulae for star formation histories that are more
accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide

predictions of cluster observable properties, in which feedback from active
galactic nuclei (AGN) is a critical component. In order to model the physical
effects due to supermassive black holes (SMBH) on cosmological scales, subgrid
modeling is required, and a variety of implementations have been developed in
the literature. However, theoretical uncertainties due to model and parameter
variations are not yet well understood, limiting the predictive power of
simulations including AGN feedback. By performing a detailed parameter
sensitivity study in a single cluster using several commonly-adopted AGN
accretion and feedback models with FLASH, we quantify the model uncertainties
in predictions of cluster integrated properties. We find that quantities that
are more sensitive to gas density have larger uncertainties (~20% for Mgas and
a factor of ~2 for Lx at R500), whereas Tx, Ysz, and Yx are more robust
(~10-20% at R500). To make predictions beyond this level of accuracy would
require more constraints on the most relevant parameters: the accretion model,
mechanical heating efficiency, and size of feedback region. By studying the
impact of AGN feedback on the scaling relations, we find that an
anti-correlation exists between Mgas and Tx, which is another reason why Ysz
and Yx are excellent mass proxies. This anti-correlation also implies that AGN
feedback is likely to be an important source of intrinsic scatter in the
Mgas-Tx and Lx-Tx relations.

jet simply thrusts through with no signs of strong interaction. This is further
strengthened by the presence of a kT~1 keV collisionally ionized component in
the ACIS spectrum of a shock heated cloud (HST-G). We estimate that the

time-resolved emission spectrum is best modeled with a combination of a Band

initially 15\pm2 MeV, which is the highest value ever detected in a GRB. This
measurement was made possible by combining GBM/BGO data with LAT Low Energy

of the blackbody component also decreased, starting from ~80 keV, and the decay

smaller values of $c_s$, the positive correlation between $r$ and $n_s$ also
leads to slightly tighter constraint on the upper bound of $n_s$, while the
running of scalar spectral index $dn_s/d\ln k$ is generally unaffected. For the
sound speed $c_s$, it is not well constrained if only the CMB power spectrum
data is used, while the constraints are obtainable by taking $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm

using the first two years of data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
Survey (BOSS). Stellar masses are obtained by fitting model spectral energy
distributions to u,g,r,i,z magnitudes, and simulations with mock galaxies are
used to understand how well the templates recover the stellar mass. Accurate
BOSS spectroscopic redshifts are used to constrain the fits. We find that the
distribution of stellar masses in BOSS is narrow (Delta log M~0.5 dex) and
peaks at about logM ~ 11.3 (for a Kroupa initial stellar mass function), and
that the mass sampling is uniform over the redshift range 0.2 to 0.6, in
agreement with the intended BOSS target selection. The galaxy masses probed by
BOSS extend over ~10^{12} M, providing unprecedented measurements of the
high-mass end of the galaxy mass function. We find that the galaxy number
density above ~ 2.5 10^{11} M agrees with previous determinations. We perform a
comparison with semi-analytic galaxy formation models tailored to the BOSS
target selection and volume, in order to contain incompleteness. The abundance
of massive galaxies in the models compare fairly well with the BOSS data, but
the models lack galaxies at the massive end. Moreover, no evolution with
redshift is detected from ~0.6 to 0.4 in the data, whereas the abundance of
massive galaxies in the models increases to redshift zero. Additionally, BOSS
data display colour-magnitude (mass) relations similar to those found in the
local Universe, where the most massive galaxies are the reddest. On the other
hand, the model colours do not display a dependence on stellar mass, span a
narrower range and are typically bluer than the observations. We argue that the
lack of a colour-mass relation for massive galaxies in the models is mostly due
to metallicity, which is too low in the models.

Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) collaboration. This data set has been
released in the ninth SDSS data release, the first public data release of BOSS
spectra. We show that the typical signal-to-noise ratio of BOSS spectra is
sufficient to measure stellar velocity dispersion and emission line fluxes for
individual objects. The typical velocity dispersion of a BOSS galaxy is 240
km/s, with an accuracy of better than 30 per cent for 93 per cent of BOSS
galaxies. The distribution in velocity dispersion is redshift independent
between redshifts 0.15 and 0.7, which reflects the survey design targeting
massive galaxies with an approximately uniform mass distribution in this
redshift interval. The majority of BOSS galaxies lack detectable emission
lines. We analyse the emission line properties and present diagnostic diagrams
using the emission lines [OII], Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha, and [NII] (detected in
about 4 per cent of the galaxies). We show that the emission line properties
are strongly redshift dependent and that there is a clear correlation between
observed frame colours and emission line properties. Within in the low-z sample
around 0.15<z<0.3, half of the emission-line galaxies have LINER-like emission
line ratios, followed by Seyfert-AGN dominated spectra, and only a small
fraction of a few per cent are purely star forming galaxies. AGN and LINER-like
objects, instead, are less prevalent in the high-z sample around 0.4<z<0.7,
where more than half of the emission line objects are star forming. This is a
pure selection effect caused by the non-detection of weak Hbeta emission lines
in the BOSS spectra. Finally, we show that star forming, AGN and emission line
free galaxies are well separated in the g-r vs r-i target selection diagram.

of their large-scale environment. In order to characterize the environment on
large scales, we use the catalogue of future virialized superstructures (FVS)
by Luparello et al. and separate samples of luminous galaxies according to
whether or not they belong to FVS. In order to avoid biases in the selection of
galaxies, we have constructed different subsamples so that the distributions of
luminosities and masses are comparable outside and within FVS. As expected, at
large scales, there is a strong difference between the clustering of galaxies
inside and outside FVS. However, this behaviour changes at scales r < 1 Mpc/h,
where the correlations have similar amplitudes. The amplitude of the two-halo
term of the correlation function for objects inside FVS does not depend on
their mass, but rather on that of the FVS. This is confirmed by comparing this
amplitude with that expected from extended Press-Schechter fits. In order to
compare these observational results with current models for structure
formation, we have performed a similar analysis using a semi-analytic
implementation in a LCDM cosmological model. We find that the cross-correlation
functions from the mock catalogue depend on the large-scale structures in a
similar way to the observations. From our analysis, we conclude that the
clustering of galaxies within the typical virialized regions of groups, mainly
depends on the halo mass, irrespective of the large-scale environment.

7""x12"" area on the sky having unity fill-factor with ~300 spatial elements that
subsample the median HET image quality. The fiber feed assembly includes an
optimized dichroic beam splitter that allows LRS2-B to simultaneously observe
370 nm to 470 nm and 460 nm to 700 nm at fixed resolving powers of R \approx
1900 and 1200, respectively. We discuss the departures from the nominal VIRUS
design, which includes the IFU, fiber feed, camera correcting optics, and
volume phase holographic grisms. Additionally, the motivation for the selection
of the wavelength coverage and spectral resolution of the two channels is
briefly discussed. One such motivation is the follow-up study of spectrally and

of the universe is generated by cosmic structure formation, without resort to
Dark Energy, modifications to gravity, or a local void. The observed
acceleration results from the combined effect of innumerable local
perturbations due to individually virializing systems, overlapping together in
a smoothly-inhomogeneous adjustment of the FRW metric, in a process governed by
the causal flow of inhomogeneity information outward from each clumped system.
After noting how common arguments claiming to limit backreaction are physically
unrealistic, models are presented which fit the supernova luminosity distance
data essentially as well as $\Lambda$CDM, while bringing several important
cosmological parameters to a new Concordance. These goals are all achieved with
a second-generation version of our formalism that accounts for the negative
feedback of Causal Backreaction upon itself due to the slowed propagation of
gravitational inhomogeneity information.

reasonable possibility of the growth of instabilities. In addition, much work
in the literature has invoked this possibility in order to explain observed jet
structures and obtain information from these structures. For example, it was
recently shown that the observed helical structures in the jet in S5 0836+710
could be associated with helical pressure waves generated by Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability. Our aim is to resolve the arc-second structure of the jet in the
quasar S5 0836+710 and confirm the lack of a hot-spot (reverse jet-shock) found
by present observing arrays, as this lack implies a loss of jet collimation
before interaction with the intergalactic medium. In this work, we use an
observation performed in 2008 using EVN and MERLIN. The combined data reduction
has provided a complete image of the object at arc-second scales. The lack of a
hot-spot in the arc-second radio structure is taken as evidence that the jet
losses its collimation between the VLBI region and the region of interaction
with the ambient medium. This result, together with the previous identification
of the helical structures in the jet with helical pressure waves that grow in
amplitude with distance, allow us to conclude that the jet is probably
disrupted by the growth of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. This observational
evidence confirms that the physical parameters of jets can be extracted using
the assumption that instability is present in jets and can be the reason for
many observed structures. Interestingly, the observed jet is classified as a
FRII object in terms of its luminosity, but its large-scale morphology does not
correspond to this classification. The implications of this fact are discussed.

cataloguing of CMEs tedious, and so a robust method of detection and analysis
is required. This has led to the development of automated CME detection and
cata- loguing packages such as CACTus, SEEDS and ARTEMIS. Here we present the
development of a new CORIMP (coronal image processing) CME detection and
tracking technique that overcomes many of the drawbacks of current catalogues.
It works by first employing the dynamic CME separation technique outlined in a
companion paper, and then characterising CME structure via a multiscale
edge-detection algorithm. The detections are chained through time to determine
the CME kinematics and morphological changes as it propagates across the
plane-of-sky. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by its
application to a selection of SOHO/LASCO and STEREO/SECCHI images, as well as
to synthetic coronagraph images created from a model corona with a variety of

AMN/(M+N-1) degrees of freedom (DoF), thus resolving in this case a discrepancy
between the spatial scale invariance conjecture (scaling the number of antennas
at each node by a constant factor will scale the total DoF by the same factor)
and a decomposability property of overconstrained wireless networks. While the
best previously-known general DoF outer bound is consistent with the spatial
invariance conjecture, the best previously-known general DoF inner bound,
inspired by the K user MIMO interference channel, was based on the
decomposition of every transmitter and receiver into multiple single antenna
nodes, transforming the network into an AM X AN user SISO X network. While such
a decomposition is DoF optimal for the K user MIMO interference channel, a gap
remained between the best inner and outer bound for the MIMO X channel. Here we
close this gap with the new insight that the MIMO X network is only one-sided
decomposable, i.e., either all the transmitters or all the receivers (but not
both) can be decomposed by splitting multiple antenna nodes into multiple
single antenna nodes without loss of DoF. The result is extended to SIMO and
MISO X networks as well and in each case the DoF results satisfy the spatial
scale invariance property. In addition, the feasibility of linear interference
alignment is investigated based only on spatial beamforming without symbol
extensions. Similar to MIMO interference networks, we show that when the
problem is improper, it is infeasible.

of the Galactic plane (-70deg > l > 30deg, |b| < 0.5deg) using the 22-m Mopra
antenna at 12-mm wavelengths. Observations were conducted in on-the-fly mode
using the Mopra spectrometer (MOPS), targeting water masers, thermal molecular
emission and radio-recombination lines. Foremost among the thermal lines are
the 23 GHz transitions of NH3 J,K = (1,1) and (2,2), which trace the densest
parts of molecular clouds (n > 10^4 cm^{-3}). In this paper we present the NH3
(1,1) and (2,2) data, which have a resolution of 2 arcmin and cover a velocity
range of +/-200 km/s. The median sensitivity of the NH3 data-cubes is sigma_Tmb
= 0.20 +/1 0.06 K. For the (1,1) transition this sensitivity equates to a 3.2
kpc distance limit for detecting a 20 K, 400 Msun cloud at the 5-sigma level.
Similar clouds of mass 5,000 Msun would be detected as far as the Galactic
centre, while 30,000 Msun clouds would be seen across the Galaxy. We have
developed an automatic emission finding procedure based on the ATNF DUCHAMP
software and have used it to create a new catalogue of 669 dense molecular
clouds. The catalogue is 100 percent complete at the 5-sigma detection limit
(Tmb = 1.0 K). A preliminary analysis of the ensemble cloud properties suggest
that the near kinematic distances are favoured. The cloud positions are
consistent with current models of the Galaxy containing a long bar. Combined
with other Galactic plane surveys this new molecular-line dataset constitutes a
key tool for examining Galactic structure and evolution. Data-cubes, spectra
and catalogues are available to the community via the HOPS website.

packets before forwarding them. Recently, the buffer has been exploited in
one-way relaying to opportunistically schedule the two different links
according to their channel quality. The intuition is that, if the channel to
the destination is poor, then RS stores more data from the source, in order to
use it when the channel to the destination is good. We apply this intuition to
the case of half-duplex two-way relaying, where the interactions among the
buffers and the links become more complex. We investigate the sum-rate
maximization problem in the Time Division Broadcast (TDBC): the users send
signals to the RS in different time slots, the RS decodes and stores messages
in the buffers. For downlink transmission, the RS re-encodes and sends using
the optimal broadcast strategy. The operation in each time slot is not
determined in advance, but depends on the channel state information (CSI). We

  Singapore ""Article was withdrawn as it is being considered for a book
  publication.""",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this thesis we showed that Non-equilibrium Green's Function Perturbation
Theory (NEGF) is really the overarching perturbative transport theory. This is
shown in great detail by using NEGF as a starting point and developing in 3
directions to obtain the usual transport-related expressions. The 3 directions
are: Landauer-like theory, kinetic theory and Green-Kubo linear response
theory. This thesis is concerned with using NEGF to generalize the 2 directions
of Landauer-like theory and the kinetic theory.
  Firstly, NEGF is used to derive phonon-phonon Hedin-like functional
derivative equations which generates conserving self energy approximations for
phonon-phonon interaction. Secondly, for the Landauer-like theory, using the
perturbation expansion, we easily obtain anharmonic (or phonon-phonon
interaction) corrections to the ballistic energy current and to the noise
associated to the energy current. The lowest 3-phonon interaction, the lowest
and the second lowest 4-phonon interaction corrections to the ballistic energy
current are obtained. The lowest 3-phonon interaction correction to the noise
is obtained. Along a seperate line, we found that we can incooperate high mass
disorder into the ballistic energy current formula. The coherent potential
approximation (CPA) for treating high mass disorder is found to be compatible
with the ballistic energy current expression.
  Lastly, for the kinetic theory, Wigner coordinates + gradient expansion
easily allow the reproduction of the usual phonon Boltzmann kinetic equation.
It is also straightforward to derive phonon-phonon correlation corrections to
kinetic equations. Kinetic equations lead to hydrodynamic (balance) equations
and we derived phonon-phonon correlation corrections to the entropy, energy and
momentum balance equations.

However, it has serious consequences for the description of Gamow-Teller

adding further phenomenological parameters. Relativistic Hartree-Fock models do
not suffer from these problems. They can successfully describe the GTR and SDR

viable way to detect close-in rocky planets around white dwarfs. Multi-band
polarimetry would also allow reveal the presence of a planet atmosphere,
providing a first characterisation. Planets in the CHZ of a 0.6 M_sun white
dwarf will be distorted by Roche geometry, and a Kepler-11d analogue would
overfill its Roche lobe. With current facilities a Super-Earth-sized

demonstrated by the perturbation calculations, and the PSS-breaking term can be

zero-point agrees within 0.01 \kms with the zero-points carefully determined by
Nidever et al. (2002) and Latham et al. (2002). For reference we compute the

solid state and biomedical applications. Apatites are open structures, which
can undergo complex anisotropic deformations, and the response of NMR can
elucidate the microscopic changes induced by an applied pressure. The computed
NMR parameters proved to be in good agreement with the available experimental
data. The structural evaluation of the material behavior under hydrostatic
pressure (from --5 to +100 kbar) indicated a shrinkage of the diameter of the
apatitic channel, and a strong correlation between NMR shielding and pressure,
proving the sensitivity of this technique to even small changes in the chemical
environment around the nuclei. This theoretical approach allows the exploration
of all the different nuclei composing the material, thus providing a very
useful guidance in the interpretation of experimental results, particularly
valuable for the more challenging nuclei such as $^{43}$Ca and $^{17}$O.

devise estimators for these spectra in the presence of a realistic

noise levels that correspond to the Planck (143 GHz channel) and EPIC (150 GHz

of this study is to characterize the photometric decay of the satellite sunspot
and the evolution of photospheric and chromospheric horizontal proper motions
in its surroundings. We apply the local correlation tracking technique to a
16-hour time-series of Hinode G-band and CaIIH images and study the horizontal
proper motions in the vicinity of the satellite sunspot on 2006 December 7.
Decorrelation times were computed to measure the lifetime of solar features in
intensity and flow maps. We observed shear flows in the dominant umbral cores
of the satellite sunspot. These flows vanished once the penumbra had
disappeared. This slow penumbral decay had an average rate of 152Mm2/day over
an 11-hour period. Typical lifetimes of intensity features derived from an
autocorrelation analysis are 3-5min for granulation, 25-35min for G-band bright
points, and up to 200-235min for penumbrae, umbrae, and pores. Long-lived
intensity features (i.e., the dominant umbral cores) are not related to
long-lived flow features in the northern part of the sunspot, where flux
removal, slowly decaying penumbrae, and persistent horizontal flows of up to 1
km/s contribute to the erosion of the sunspot. Finally, the restructuring of
magnetic field topology was responsible for a homologous M2.0 flare, which
shared many characteristics with an X6.5 flare on the previous day.
Notwithstanding the prominent role of delta-spots in flaring, we conclude based
on the decomposition of the satellite sunspot, the evolution of the surrounding
flow fields, and the timing of the M2.0 flare that the vanishing magnetic flux
in the decaying satellite sunspot played an instrumental role in triggering the
homologous M2.0 flare and the eruption of a small Halpha filament.

Through the technique of reverse logistic regression we estimate and compare

offset), and (iii) the monopole+dipole hypothesis (a cosmic variation manifest
to the Earth-bound observer as a North-South divergence)---under a variety of

weak support for a skeptical interpretation in which the apparent dipole effect
is driven solely by systematic errors of opposing sign inherent in measurements
from the two telescopes employed to obtain these observations. Throughout we
seek to exemplify a 'best practice' approach to Bayesian model selection with
prior-sensitivity analysis; in a companion paper we extend this methodology to
a semi-parametric framework using the infinite-dimensional Dirichlet process.

programs (RCP). RCPs are convex optimization problems with a (usually large)
number N of randomly extracted constraints; they arise in several applicative
areas, especially in the context of decision under uncertainty, see [2],[3]. We
here consider a setup in which instances of the random constraints (the
scenario) are not held by a single centralized processing unit, but are
distributed among different nodes of a network. Each node ""sees"" only a small
subset of the constraints, and may communicate with neighbors. The objective is
to make all nodes converge to the same solution as the centralized RCP problem.
To this end, we develop two distributed algorithms that are variants of the
constraints consensus algorithm [4],[5]: the active constraints consensus (ACC)
algorithm, and the vertex constraints consensus (VCC) algorithm. We show that
the ACC algorithm computes the overall optimal solution in finite time, and
with almost surely bounded communication at each iteration. The VCC algorithm
is instead tailored for the special case in which the constraint functions are
convex also w.r.t. the uncertain parameters, and it computes the solution in a
number of iterations bounded by the diameter of the communication graph. We
further devise a variant of the VCC algorithm, namely quantized vertex
constraints consensus (qVCC), to cope with the case in which communication
bandwidth among processors is bounded. We discuss several applications of the
proposed distributed techniques, including estimation, classification, and
random model predictive control, and we present a numerical analysis of the
performance of the proposed methods. As a complementary numerical result, we
show that the parallel computation of the scenario solution using ACC algorithm
significantly outperforms its centralized equivalent.

  Although the tilings were originally obtained by matching rules and by

in the plane. If $X_Q$ denotes the set of all Taylor-Socolar tilings with
centers on $Q$ then $X_Q$ forms a natural hull under the standard local
topology of hulls and is a dynamical system for the action of $Q$. The $Q$-adic
completion $\bar{Q}$ of $Q$ is a natural factor of $X_Q$ and the natural
mapping $X_Q \longrightarrow \bar{Q}$ is bijective except at a dense set of
points of measure 0 in $\bar{Q}$. We show that $X_Q$ consists of three LI
classes under translation. Two of these LI classes are very small, namely
countable $Q$-orbits in $X_Q$. The other is a minimal dynamical system which
maps surjectively to $\bar{Q}$ and which is variously $2:1$, $6:1$, and $12:1$

temporal non-locality in the mean electromotive force (emf). This arises in
random flows due to a finite response time of the mean emf to changes in the
mean magnetic field, and leads to the telegraph equation for the mean field.
The resulting dynamo model also includes the nonlinear dynamo effects arising
from magnetic helicity balance. Within this framework, coherent large-scale
magnetic spiral arms superimposed on the dominant axially symmetric magnetic
structure are considered. A non-axisymmetric forcing of the mean-field dynamo
by a spiral pattern (either stationary or transient) is invoked, with the aim
of explaining the phenomenon of magnetic arms. For a stationary dynamo forcing
by a rigidly rotating material spiral, we find corotating non-axisymmetric
magnetic modes enslaved to the axisymmetric modes and strongly peaked around
the corotation radius. For a forcing by transient material arms wound up by the
galactic differential rotation, the magnetic spiral is able to adjust to the
winding so that it resembles the material spiral at all times. There are
profound effects associated with the temporal non-locality, i.e. finite `dynamo
relaxation time'. For the case of a rigidly rotating spiral, a finite
relaxation time causes each magnetic arm to mostly lag the corresponding
material arm with respect to the rotation. For a transient material spiral that
winds up, the finite dynamo relaxation time leads to a large, negative (in the
sense of the rotation) phase shift between the magnetic and material arms,
similar to that observed in NGC 6946 and other galaxies. We confirm that
sufficiently strong random seed fields can lead to global reversals of the
regular field along the radius whose long-term survival depends on specific
features of a given galaxy.

to compress it and store, using little memory, the value of the minimum cut (or
equivalently, maximum flow) between every bipartition of terminals. One
appealing methodology to implement a compression of $G$ is to construct a
\emph{mimicking network}: a small network $G'$ with the same $k$ terminals, in
which the minimum cut value between every bipartition of terminals is the same
as in $G$. This notion was introduced by Hagerup, Katajainen, Nishimura, and
Ragde [JCSS '98], who proved that such $G'$ of size at most $2^{2^k}$ always
exists. Obviously, by having access to the smaller network $G'$, certain
computations involving cuts can be carried out much more efficiently.
  We provide several new bounds, which together narrow the previously known gap
from doubly-exponential to only singly-exponential, both for planar and for
general graphs. Our first and main result is that every $k$-terminal planar
network admits a mimicking network $G'$ of size $O(k^2 2^{2k})$, which is
moreover a minor of $G$. On the other hand, some planar networks $G$ require
$|E(G')| \ge \Omega(k^2)$. For general networks, we show that certain bipartite
graphs only admit mimicking networks of size $|V(G')| \geq 2^{\Omega(k)}$, and
moreover, every data structure that stores the minimum cut value between all
bipartitions of the terminals must use $2^{\Omega(k)}$ machine words.

during the non-linear evolution of the beam-plasma system, the accelerated

its energy efficiently to the thermal plasma, a noticeable part of the electron
population is accelerated. For model cases with initially monoenergetic beams
in uniform plasma, we found that the amount of energy in the accelerated
electrons above the injected beam-electron energy varies depending the plasma
conditions and could be around 10-30% of the initial beam energy. This type of
acceleration could be important for the interpretation of non-thermal electron
populations in solar flares. Its neglect could lead to the over-estimation of

timescales, which may affect their response to stimulation through non-linear
and stochastic interaction with ion channels and ionic concentrations. Since
new processes are constantly being discovered, biophysical neuron models
increasingly become ""too complex to be useful"" yet ""too simple to be
realistic"". A fundamental open question in theoretical neuroscience pertains to
how this deadlock may be resolved. In order to tackle this problem, we first
define the notion of a ""excitable neuron model"". Then we analytically derive
the input-output relation of such neuronal models, relating input spike trains
to output spikes based on known biophysical properties. Thus we obtain
closed-form expressions for the mean firing rates, all second order statistics
(input-state-output correlation and spectra) and construct optimal linear
estimators for the neuronal response and internal state. These results are
guaranteed to hold, given a few generic assumptions, for any stochastic
biophysical neuron model (with an arbitrary number of slow kinetic processes)
under general sparse stimulation. This solution suggests that the common
simplifying approach that ignores much of the complexity of the neuron might
actually be unnecessary and even deleterious in some cases. Specifically, the
stochasticity of ion channels and the temporal sparseness of inputs is exactly
what rendered our analysis tractable, allowing us to incorporate slow kinetics.

focusing particularly on the case when the singlet mass lies within a narrow ~
few GeV window around the Higgs mass. Such a `singlet neighbor' presents novel
mechanisms for modifying the observed properties of the Higgs boson. For
instance, even a small amount of the Higgs-singlet mixing can lead to a
significant enhancement of the apparent diphoton rate. Alternatively, the Higgs
may decay into the nearby singlet, along with a very light, very soft mediator
particle, in which case there can be O(1) enhancement to the apparent diphoton
rate even for ~ TeV-scale charged vector-like matter. We also explore models in
which vector-like fermions mix with the SM leptons, causing the simultaneous
enhancement of diphoton and suppression of ditau Higgs branching ratios. Our
scenario can be tested with the accumulating LHC data by probing for the

We find that a distinct phenomenology arises when compared with standard

close proximity to a planar interface. Efficient incorporation of this
potential into the Schr\""{o}dinger equation is utilized to map out the
influence of the image potential effects on carrier tunneling in such
heterostructures. In particular, the interplay between carrier mass and the
dielectric constants of a quantum dot, its surrounding matrix, and the
electrode is studied. We find that the polarizability of the planar electrode
structure can significantly increase the tunneling rates for heavier carriers,
potentially resulting in a qualitative change in the dependence of tunneling
rate on mass. Our method for treating polarization can be generalized to the
screening of two particle interactions, and can thus be applied to calculations
such as exciton dissociation and the Coulomb blockade. In contrast to tunneling
via intermediate surface localized states of the quantum dot, our work
identifies the parameter space over which volume states undergo significant
modification in their tunneling characteristics.

namely functions with a small number of overall input-output dependencies. In
contrast to previous works, we seek extractors for essentially all the entropy
without any assumption on the underlying distribution beyond a min-entropy
requirement. We give two simple constructions of sparse extractor families,
which are collections of sparse functions such that for any distribution X on
inputs of sufficiently high min-entropy, the output of most functions from the
collection on a random input chosen from X is statistically close to uniform.
  For strong extractor families (i.e., functions in the family do not take
additional randomness) we give upper and lower bounds on the sparsity that are
tight up to a constant factor for a wide range of min-entropies. We then prove
that for some min-entropies weak extractor families can achieve better
sparsity.
  We show how this construction can be used towards more efficient parallel
transformation of (non-uniform) one-way functions into pseudorandom generators.
More generally, sparse extractor families can be used instead of pairwise
independence in various randomized or nonuniform settings where preserving
locality (i.e., parallelism) is of interest.

cosmological gravitational wave background. Prompted by the fact that a
possible candidate to source those gravitational waves would be cosmic strings,
we perform a parameter fitting study with models which considers both cosmic
strings and the effective number of neutrinos as free parameters, using CMB and

the number of extra relativistic species, and that strings can account for all
the extra radiation necessary. In fact, CMB data prefer strings at a 2sigma
level, paying the price of a higher extra radiation component. CMB data also
give a moderate preference for a model with ns=1. The inclusion of non-CMB data
lowers both the preference for strings and for the extra relativistic species.

non-deterministic timed automata with inputs and outputs (TAIOs) in the formal
framework of the tioco conformance theory. In this context, a first problem is
the determinization of TAIOs, which is necessary to foresee next enabled
actions after an observable trace, but is in general impossible because not all
timed automata are determinizable. This problem is solved thanks to an
approximate determinization using a game approach. The algorithm performs an
io-abstraction which preserves the tioco conformance relation and thus
guarantees the soundness of generated test cases. A second problem is the
selection of test cases from a TAIO specification. The selection here relies on
a precise description of timed behaviors to be tested which is carried out by
expressive test purposes modeled by a generalization of TAIOs. Finally, an
algorithm is described which generates test cases in the form of TAIOs equipped
with verdicts, using a symbolic co-reachability analysis guided by the test
purpose. Properties of test cases are then analyzed with respect to the
precision of the approximate determinization: when determinization is exact,
which is the case on known determinizable classes, in addition to soundness,
properties characterizing the adequacy of test cases verdicts are also
guaranteed.

shape communities are generic and follow two approaches: maximizing the
internal density of such communities or reducing the connectivity of the
internal vertices with those outside the community. However, these metrics take
the edges as a set and do not consider the internal layout of the edges in the
community. We define a set of properties oriented to social networks that
ensure that communities are cohesive, structured and well defined. Then, we
propose the Weighted Community Clustering (WCC), which is a community metric
based on triangles. We proof that analyzing communities by triangles gives
communities that fulfill the listed set of properties, in contrast to previous

two radical parties (A and B) interact with ""centrists"" (C and Cz), we study
the competition between a persuasive majority and a committed minority. In this
model, A's and B's are incompatible voters that can convince centrists or be
swayed by them. Here, radical voters are more persuasive than centrists, whose
sub-population consists of susceptible agents C and a fraction zeta of centrist
zealots Cz. Whereas C's may adopt the opinions A and B with respective rates
1+delta_A and 1+delta_B (with delta_A>=delta_B>0), Cz's are committed
individuals that always remain centrists. Furthermore, A and B voters can
become (susceptible) centrists C with a rate 1. The resulting competition
between commitment and persuasion is studied in the mean field limit and for a
finite population on a complete graph. At mean field level, there is a
continuous transition from a coexistence phase when
zeta<Delta_c=delta_A/(1+delta_A) to a phase where centrism prevails when zeta>=
Delta_c. In a finite population of size N, demographic fluctuations lead to
centrism consensus and the dynamics is characterized by the mean consensus time
tau. Because of the competition between commitment and persuasion, here
consensus is reached much slower (zeta<Delta_c) or faster (zeta>=Delta_c) than
in the absence of zealots (when tau\simN). In fact, when zeta<Delta_c and there
is an initial minority of centrists, the mean consensus time asymptotically
grows as tau\simN^{-1/2} e^{N gamma}, where gamma is determined. The dynamics
is thus characterized by a metastable state where the most persuasive voters
and centrists coexist when delta_A>delta_B, whereas all species coexist when
delta_A=delta_B. When zeta>=Delta_c and the initial density of centrists is
low, one finds tau\simln N (when N>>1). Our analytical findings are
corroborated by stochastic simulations.

experiment at TeV energies, with a statistical significance of 6.2 standard
deviations. The peak of the signal is found at a position consistent with the
pulsar PSR J1907+0602. Parametrizing the source shape with a two-dimensional
Gauss function we estimate an extension \sigma = 0.49 \pm 0.22 degrees,
consistent with a previous measurement by the Cherenkov Array H.E.S.S.. The
observed energy spectrum is dN/dE = 6.1 \pm 1.4 \times 10^-13 (E/4 TeV)^{-2.54
\pm 0.36} photons cm^-2 s^-1 TeV^-1, in the energy range 1-20 TeV. The measured
gamma ray flux is consistent with the results of the Milagro detector, but is
2-3 times larger than the flux previously derived by H.E.S.S. at energies of a
few TeV. The continuity of the Milagro and ARGO-YBJ observations and the stable
excess rate observed by ARGO-YBJ along 4 years of data taking support the
identification of MGRO J1908+06 as the steady powerful TeV pulsar wind nebula
of PSR J1907+0602, with an integrated luminosity above 1 TeV about 1.8 times
the Crab Nebula luminosity.

comparable to each other, there exists a range of scales in which the effective

high-energy and very-high-energy gamma-ray domains. As exemplified by RX
J1713.7-3946, the nature of this emission has been hotly debated, and direct
evidence for the efficient acceleration of cosmic-ray protons at the SNR shocks
still remains elusive. We analyzed more than 40 months of data acquired by the
Large Area Telescope (LAT) on-board the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope in the
HE domain, and gathered all of the relevant multi-wavelength (from radio to VHE
gamma-rays) information about the broadband nonthermal emission from RCW 86.
For this purpose, we re-analyzed the archival X-ray data from the ASCA/Gas
Imaging Spectrometer (GIS), the XMM-Newton/EPIC-MOS, and the RXTE/Proportional
Counter Array (PCA). Beyond the expected Galactic diffuse background, no
significant gamma-ray emission in the direction of RCW 86 is detected in any of
the 0.1-1, 1-10 and 10-100 GeV Fermi-LAT maps. In the hadronic scenario, the
derived HE upper limits together with the HESS measurements in the VHE domain
can only be accommodated by a spectral index Gamma <= 1.8, i.e. a value
in-between the standard (test-particle) index and the asymptotic limit of
theoretical particle spectra in the case of strongly modified shocks. The
interpretation of the gamma-ray emission by inverse Compton scattering of high
energy electrons reproduces the multi-wavelength data using a reasonable value
for the average magnetic field of 15-25 muG. For these two scenarios, we
assessed the level of acceleration efficiency. We discuss these results in the

gamma-ray activity coincides with the same repetitive pattern of
multiwavelength emission and to analyze in depth the overall gamma-ray spectrum
by assuming both leptonic and hadronic scenarios. Seven intense gamma-ray
events were detected in this period, with a typical event lasting one or two
days. These durations are longer than the likely cooling times of the gamma-ray
emitting particles, implying we see continuous acceleration rather than the
result of an impulsive event such as the ejection of a single plasmoid which
then cools as it propagates outwards. Cross-correlating the AGILE-GRID light
curve with X-ray and radio monitoring data, we find that the main events of
gamma-ray activity have been detected while the system was in soft spectral
X-ray states (RXTE/ASM count rate > 3 counts/s), that coincide with local and
often sharp minima of the hard X-ray flux (Swift/BAT count rate < 0.02
counts/cm^2/s), a few days before intense radio outbursts. [...] These
gamma-ray events may thus reflect a sharp transition in the structure of the
accretion disk and its corona, which leads to a rebirth of the microquasar jet
and subsequent enhanced radio activity. [...] Finally, we examine leptonic and
hadronic emission models for the gamma-ray events and find that both scenarios
are valid. In the leptonic model - based on inverse Compton scatterings of
mildly relativistic electrons on soft photons from the Wolf-Rayet companion
star and from the accretion disk - the emitting particles may also contribute
to the overall hard X-ray spectrum, possibly explaining the hard non-thermal
power-law tail sometimes seen during special soft X-ray states in Cygnus X-3.

functional and the corresponding matrix gap equation in powers of the small
deviation from the critical temperature tau = 1-T/T_c. The two lowest orders of
this expansion produce the equation for T_c and the GL theory. It is shown that
in agreement with previous studies, the two-band GL theory maps onto the
single-band GL model and thus fails to describe the difference in the spatial
profiles of the two band condensates. We prove that except for some very
special cases, this difference appears already in the leading correction to the
GL theory, which constitutes the extended GL formalism. We derive linear
differential equations that determine the leading corrections to the band order
parameters and magnetic field, discuss the validity of these equations, and
consider examples of an important interplay between the band condensates.
Finally, we present numerical results for the thermodynamic critical magnetic
field and temperature-dependent band gaps (at zero field), which are in a very
good agreement with those obtained from the full BCS approach in a wide
temperature range. To this end, we emphasize the advantages of our extended GL
theory in comparison with the often used two-component GL-like model based on

signature of the formation processes of the galactic disk. We use
nondissipative numerical simulations to follow the evolution of a Milky Way
(MW)-like disk to verify if secular dynamical processes can account for this
correlation in the old thick disk stellar population. We followed the evolution
of an ancient disk population represented by 10 million particles whose
chemical abundances were assigned by assuming a cosmologically plausible radial
metallicity gradient with lower metallicity in the inner regions, as expected
for the 10-Gyr-old MW. Essentially, inner disk stars move towards the outer
regions and populate layers located at higher |z|. A rotation--metallicity
correlation appears, which well resembles the behaviour observed in our Galaxy
at a galactocentric distance between 8 kpc and 10 kpc. In particular,we measure
a correlation of \partial V_\phi/\partial[Fe/H]\simeq 60 km s^{-1}dex^{-1} for
particles at 1.5 kpc < |z| < 2.0 kpc that persists up to 6 Gyr. Our pure N-body
models can account for the V_\phi vs. [Fe/H] correlation observed in the thick
disk of our Galaxy, suggesting that processes internal to the disk such as
heating and radial migration play a role in the formation of this old stellar
component. In this scenario, the positive rotation-metallicity correlation of
the old thick disk population would represent the relic signature of an ancient
""inverse"" chemical (radial) gradient in the inner Galaxy, which resulted from
accretion of primordial gas.

particular the amount of matter remaining outside the black hole at late times
and its properties, has been one of the main motivations behind the numerical
simulation of these systems. Black hole-neutron star binaries are amongst the
most likely progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts --- as long as massive
(probably a few percents of a solar mass), hot accretion disks are formed
around the black hole. Whether this actually happens strongly depends on the
physical characteristics of the system, and in particular on the mass ratio,
the spin of the black hole, and the radius of the neutron star. We present here
a simple two-parameter model, fitted to existing numerical results, for the
determination of the mass remaining outside the black hole a few milliseconds
after a black hole-neutron star merger (i.e. the combined mass of the accretion
disk, the tidal tail, and the potential ejecta). This model predicts the
remnant mass within a few percents of the mass of the neutron star, at least
for remnant masses up to 20% of the neutron star mass. Results across the range
of parameters deemed to be the most likely astrophysically are presented here.
We find that, for 10 solar mass black holes, massive disks are only possible
for large neutron stars (R>12km), or quasi-extremal black hole spins (a/M>0.9).
We also use our model to discuss how the equation of state of the neutron star
affects the final remnant, and the strong influence that this can have on the
rate of short gamma-ray bursts produced by black hole-neutron star mergers.

through suppression of heavy seesaw scale. In inverse seesaw models the seesaw

lowered to be in the range probed by experiments at the LHC without fine
tuning. In this paper we construct models in which inverse seesaw neutrino
masses are generated at two loop level. These models also naturally have dark
matter candidates. Although the recent data from Xenon100 put stringent

mixing, dark matter relic density and direct detection. These models also have
some interesting experimental signatures for collider and flavor physics.

length, resulting in nonmonotonic intervortex forces.
