Subsequent explicit study of 14 different octahedral tilt-patterns showed that
the I4/mcm, Imma, and R\bar{3}c structures, all with antiferrodistortive
rotations of the octahedra, have significantly lower total energy than the

underlying gossiping mechanism: whereas the earlier model assumed that an

Accepted for publication in ApJ",,"10.1088/0004-637X/763/1/62",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The centers of stellar spheroids are often marked by the presence of
nucleated central regions, called nuclear star clusters (NSCs). The origin of
NSCs is still unclear. Here we investigate the possibility that NSCs originate
from the migration and merger of stellar clusters at the center of galaxies
where a massive black hole (MBH) may sit. We show that the observed relation
between NSC masses and the velocity dispersion of their host spheroids cannot
be reconciled with a purely in-situ formation scenario. On the other hand, the
observed relation appears to be in agreement with the predictions of the
cluster merger model which also reproduces the observed relation between the
size of NSCs and their total luminosity. We evolve through dynamical friction a
population of stellar clusters in a model of a galactic bulge taking into
account dynamical dissolution, starting from a power-law cluster initial mass
function and a total mass in stellar clusters consistent with the cluster
formation efficiency of the Milky Way (MW). The most massive clusters reach the
center of the galaxy and merge to form a compact nucleus; after 10 Gyr, the
resulting NSC has properties that are consistent with the observed distribution
of stars in the MW NSC. When a MBH is included at the center of a galaxy,
globular clusters are tidally disrupted during inspiral, resulting in NSCs with
lower densities than those of NSCs forming in galaxies with no MBHs. We suggest
this as a possible explanation for the lack of NSCs in galaxies containing MBHs
more massive than ~10^8M_Sun. Finally, we investigate the orbital evolution of
globular clusters in giant elliptical galaxies which are believed to always
host a MBH at their center rather than a NSC. In these systems an additional
mechanism can prevent a NSC from forming: the time for globular clusters to
reach the center of the galaxy is much longer than the Hubble time.

from -h to +h. The interface leads to Friedel oscillations and proximity
effects, in particular close to the quantum phase transition of the bulk, which
is a metal-insulator transition in the fermionic language. The most prominent
interface effects appear for odd-numbered rings, for which - in contrast to
even chains - the ground state is doubly degenerate. In the regime where the
bulk energy spectrum is gapped a level appears close to midgap, with a wave
function localized in the region of the interface. The two members of the
ground state doublet have two different particle number parities and spin
components S_z=+-1/2. They also have different energy levels and thus the
degeneracy does not originate from different occupancies of a rigid band

linking the two degenerate ground states resembles a Majorana operator.
Coherent superpositions of the two states may be suitable candidates for well

opportunistically access the unused/under-utilized channels of primary users
(PUs). To utilize spectrum resources efficiently, an auction scheme is often
applied where an operator serves as an auctioneer and accepts spectrum requests
from SUs. Most existing works on spectrum auctions assume that the operator has
perfect knowledge of PU activities. In practice, however, it is more likely
that the operator only has statistical information of the PU traffic when it is
trading a spectrum hole, and it is acquiring more accurate information in real
time. In this paper, we distinguish PU channels that are under the control of
the operator, where accurate channel states are revealed in real-time, and
channels that the operator acquires from PUs out of its control, where a
sense-before-use paradigm has to be followed. Considering both spectrum
uncertainty and sensing inaccuracy, we study the social welfare maximization
problem for serving SUs with various levels of delay tolerance. We first model
the problem as a finite horizon Markov decision process when the operator knows
all spectrum requests in advance, and propose an optimal dynamic programming
based algorithm. We then investigate the case when spectrum requests are
submitted online, and propose a greedy algorithm that is 1/2-competitive for
homogeneous channels and is comparable to the offline algorithm for more
general settings. We further show that the online algorithm together with a
payment scheme achieves incentive compatibility for the SUs while guaranteeing
a non-negative revenue for the operator.

studied. The dynamics of the model is described by using a two-dimensional
measure preserving mapping for the variables velocity and time. The system is
characterized by a control parameter $\epsilon$ and experiences a transition
from integrable ($\epsilon=0$) to non integrable ($\epsilon\ne 0$). For small
values of $\epsilon$, the phase space shows a mixed structure where periodic
islands, chaotic seas and invariant tori coexist. As the parameter $\epsilon$
increases and reaches a critical value $\epsilon_c$ all invariant tori are
destroyed and the chaotic sea spreads over the phase space leading the particle
to diffuse in velocity and experience Fermi acceleration (unlimited energy
growth). During the dynamics the particle can be temporarily trapped near
periodic and stable regions. We use the finite time Lyapunov exponent to
visualize this effect. The survival probability was used to obtain some of the
transport properties in the phase space. For large $\epsilon$, the survival
probability decays exponentially when it turns into a slower decay as the
control parameter $\epsilon$ is reduced. The slower decay is related to
trapping dynamics, slowing the Fermi Acceleration, i.e., unbounded growth of
the velocity

proliferation of smart handheld devices and traffic-hungry applications. A
cost-effective and practical solution is to offload cellular data through WiFi.
Recent theoretical and experimental studies show that a scheme, referred to as
delayed WiFi offloading, can significantly save the cellular capacity by
delaying users' data and exploiting mobility and thus increasing chance of
meeting WiFi APs (Access Points). Despite a huge potential of WiFi offloading
in alleviating mobile data explosion, its success largely depends on the
economic incentives provided to users and operators to deploy and use delayed
offloading. In this paper, we study how much economic benefits can be generated
due to delayed WiFi offloading, by modeling a market based on a two-stage
sequential game between a monopoly provider and users. We also provide
extensive numerical results computed using a set of parameters from the real
traces and Cisco's projection of traffic statistics in year 2015. In both
analytical and numerical results, we model a variety of practical scenarios and
control knobs in terms of traffic demand and willingness to pay of users,
spatio-temporal dependence of pricing and traffic, and diverse pricing and
delay tolerance. We demonstrate that delayed WiFi offloading has considerable
economic benefits, where the increase ranges from 21% to 152% in the provider's
revenue, and from 73% to 319% in the users' surplus, compared to on-the-spot
WiFi offloading.

this remarkable quantum phase is the ground state of a reasonable microscopic

the p4 staggered action along the Line of Constant Physics (LCP) defined by a

splitting still shows an O(a^2) behavior but with a temperature dependent
slope. In addition to the analysis done for the pion multiplet we have
performed an analogous computation for the light-strange and strange mesons and
also looked at the scalar, vector and axial vector channels to understand how
the multiplets split at finite temperature. Finally the temperature dependence

observations of the three so-called 'embedded star clusters' located in the
nuclear region of NGC1365. Adaptive-optics- corrected K-band data cubes were
obtained with the ESO/VLT instrument SINFONI. The continuum in the K-band and
emission lines such as HeI, Bracket-gamma, and several H2 lines were mapped at
an achieved angular resolution of 0.2arcsec over a field of 3x3arcsec^2 around
each source. We find that the continuum emission of the sources is spatially
resolved. This means that they are indeed cluster complexes confined to regions
of about 50pc extension. We performed robust measurements of the equivalent
width of the CO absorption band at 2.3micro and of Bracket-gamma. For the main
mid-infrared bright sources, the data only allow us to determine an upper limit
to the equivalent width of the CO bands. Under the assumption of an
instantaneously formed standard initial mass function Starburst99 model, the
new measurements are found to be incompatible with previously published
mid-infrared line ratios. We show that an upper mass limit of 25 to 30 solar
masses, lower than the typically assumed 100solar masses, allows one to simply
remove this inconsistency. For such a model, the measurements are consistent
with ages in the range of 5.5Myr to 6.5Myr, implying masses in the range from 3
to 10 x 10^6 solar masses. We detect extended gas emission both in HII and H2.
We argue that the central cluster complexes are the sources of excitation for
the whole nebulae, through ionisation and shock heating. We detect a blue wing
on the Bracket-gamma emission profile, suggesting the existence of gas outflows
centred on the cluster complexes. We do not find any evidence for the presence
of a lower mass cluster population, which would fill up a 'traditional' power
law cluster mass function.

tunneling). We theoretically show that such chiral tunneling can be directly
observed from the junction resistance of a tilted interface probed with
separate split gates. The junction resistance is shown to increase with tilt in
agreement with recent experimental evidence. The tilt dependence arises because
of the misalignment between modal density and the anisotropic transmission lobe
oriented perpendicular to the tilt. A critical determinant is the presence of
edge scattering events that can completely reverse the angle-dependence. The
absence of such reversals in the experiments indicates that these edge effects
are not overwhelmingly deleterious, making the premise of transport governed by

high resolution near-infrared camera NACO at the VLT. These data were taken
during the commissioning of the apodising phase plate (APP) coronagraph. By
inserting simulated planets into these data, we test the performance of our
method as a function of planet brightness for different positions on the image.
We find that in all cases PynPoint has a detection threshold that is superior
to that given by our LOCI analysis when assessed in a common statistical
framework. We obtain our best improvements for smaller inner working angles
(IWA). For an IWA of ~ 0.29"" we find that we achieve a detection sensitivity
that is a factor of 5 better than LOCI. We also investigate our ability to
correctly measure the flux of planets. Again, we find improvements over LOCI,
with PynPoint giving more stable results. Finally, we apply our package to a

arcmin^2) at wavelengths 500 to 950 nm and using 24 contiguous medium-band
filters (spectral resolution R 50). The data reach 26.5 mag (>3-sigma level)
with sub-arcsec seeing in all bands. SHARDS main goal is obtaining accurate
physical properties of interm- and high-z galaxies using well-sampled optical
SEDs with sufficient spectral resolution to measure absorption and emission
features. Among the different populations of high-z galaxies, SHARDS principal
targets are massive quiescent galaxies at z>1. In this paper, we outline the
observational strategy and include a detailed discussion of the special

science demonstration results about the detection and study of emission-line
galaxies (star-forming and AGN) at z=0-5. We also analyze the SEDs for a sample
of 27 quiescent massive galaxies at 1.0<z<1.4. We discuss on the improvements
introduced by the SHARDS dataset in the analysis of their SFH and stellar
properties. We discuss the systematics arising from the use of different
stellar population libraries. We find that the UV-to-MIR SEDs of the massive
quiescent galaxies at z=1.0-1.5 are well described by an exponential decaying
SFH with scale tau=100-200 Myr, age 1.5-2.0 Gyr, solar or slightly sub-solar
metallicity, and moderate extinction, A(V)~0.5 mag. We also find that galaxies
with masses above M* are typically older than lighter galaxies, as expected in
a downsizing scenario of galaxy formation. This trend is, however, model
dependent, i.e., it is significantly more evident in the results obtained with
some stellar population synthesis libraries and almost absent in others.

radiation coming to us from distant astrophysical sources, may reveal parity
violation in either the electromagnetic or gravitational sectors of the
fundamental interactions in nature. Until only recently this phenomenon could
be probed with only radio observations or observations at UV wavelengths.
Recently, there is a substantial effort to constrain such non-standard models
using observations of the rotation of the polarization plane of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) radiation. This can be done via measurements of the
$B$-modes of the CMB or by measuring its TB and EB correlations which vanish in
the standard model. In this paper we show that $EB$ correlations-based
estimator is the best for upcoming polarization experiments. The $EB$ based
estimator surpasses other estimators because it has the smallest noise and of
all the estimators is least affected by systematics. Current polarimeters are
optimized for the detection of $B$-mode polarization from either primordial
gravitational waves or by large scale structure via gravitational lensing. In
the paper we also study optimization of CMB experiments for the detection of
cosmological birefringence, in the presence of instrumental systematics, which
by themselves are capable of producing $EB$ correlations; potentially mimicking
CB.

considerable NSI sensitivity, thanks to the interference of the standard and
new physics conversion amplitudes. In particular, in some parts of NSI
parameter space, the upcoming NOvA experiment will be sensitive enough to see ~
3sigma deviations from the SM-only hypothesis. On the flip side, NSI introduce
important ambiguities in interpreting NOvA results as measurements of
CP-violation, the mass hierarchy and the octant of theta_23. In particular,
observed CP violation could be due to a phase coming from NSI, rather than the

space-division multiplexed (SDM) systems using multimode fibers exhibiting a
rapidly varying birefringence. A primary objective is to generalize the Manakov
equations, well known in the case of single-mode fibers. We first investigate a
reference case where linear coupling among the spatial modes of the fiber is
weak and after averaging over birefringence fluctuations, we obtain new Manakov
equations for multimode fibers. Such an averaging reduces the number of
intermodal nonlinear terms drastically since all four-wave-mixing terms average
out. Cross-phase modulation terms still affect multimode transmission but their
effectiveness is reduced. We then verify the accuracy of our new Manakov
equations by transmitting multiple PDM-QPSK signals over different modes of a
multimode fiber and comparing the numerical results with those obtained by
solving the full stochastic equation. The agreement is excellent in all cases
studied. A great benefit of the new equations is to reduce the computation time
by a factor of 10 or more. Another important feature observed is that
birefringence fluctuations improve system performance by reducing the impact of
fiber nonlinearities. Finally multimode fibers with strong random coupling
among all spatial modes are considered. Linear coupling is modeled using the
random matrix theory approach. We derive new Manakov equations for multimode
fibers in that regime and show that such fibers can perform better than
single-modes fiber for large number of propagating spatial modes.

infinite-dimensional Lie algebra shs[\mu], and under the duality, \mu is to be
identified with \lambda=N/(N+k+1). Here we elucidate the structure of the
(quantum) asymptotic symmetry algebra sW_{\infty}[\mu] for arbitrary \mu and
central charge c. In particular, we show that for each value of the central
charge, there are generically four different values of \mu that describe the
same sW_{\infty} algebra. Among other things this proves that the quantum
symmetries on both sides of the duality agree; this equivalence does not just
hold in the 't Hooft limit, but even at finite N and k.

However, how to apply it to a wireless network remains an unresolved issue.
Particularly, challenges lie in the joint design between the physical layer and
the routing protocol. Applying an existing routing protocol to a two-way relay
network can easily compromise the advantages of two-way relaying. Considering
routing path selection and two-way relaying together can be formulated as a
network optimization problem, but it is usually NP-hard. In this paper, we take
a different approach to study routing path selection for two-way relay
networks. Instead of solving the joint optimization problem, we study the
fundamental characteristics of a routing path consisting of multihop two-way
relaying nodes. Information theoretical analysis is carried out to derive
bandwidth efficiency and energy efficiency of a routing path in a two-way relay
network. Such analysis provides a framework of routing path selection by
considering bandwidth efficiency, energy efficiency and latency subject to
physical layer constraints such as the transmission rate, transmission power,
path loss exponent, path length, and the number of relays. This framework
provides insightful guidelines on routing protocol design of a two-way relay
network. Our analytical framework and insights are illustrated by extensive
numerical results.

quiet Sun loops are seldom identifiable and therefore difficult to study on an

2077) quiet Sun (QS) coronal loops utilizing a novel technique called the
Michigan Loop Diagnostic Technique (MLDT) is presented. This technique combines
Differential Emission Measure Tomography (DEMT) and a potential field source
surface (PFSS) model, and consists of tracing PFSS field lines through the
tomographic grid on which the Local Differential Emission Measure (LDEM) is
determined. As a result, the electron temperature Te and density Ne at each
point along each individual field line can be obtained. Using data from
STEREO/EUVI and SOHO/MDI, the MLDT identifies two types of QS loops in the
corona: so-called ""up"" loops in which the temperature increases with height,
and so-called ""down"" loops in which the temperature decreases with height. Up
loops are expected, however, down loops are a surprise, and furthermore, they
are ubiquitous in the low-latitude corona. Up loops dominate the QS at higher
latitudes. The MLDT allows independent determination of the empirical pressure
and density scale heights, and the differences between the two remain to be
explained. The down loops appear to be a newly discovered property of the solar
minimum corona that may shed light on the physics of coronal heating. The
results are shown to be robust to the calibration uncertainties of the EUVI
instrument.

that propagates through a turbulent magnetic field. The energization process of
electrons is investigated by utilizing a combination of hybrid (kinetic ions
and fluid electron) simulations and test-particle electron simulations. In this
method, the motions of the test-particle electrons are numerically integrated
in the time-dependent electric and magnetic fields generated by two-dimensional
hybrid simulations. We show that large-scale magnetic fluctuations effect
electrons in a number of ways and lead to efficient and rapid energization at
the shock front. Since the electrons mainly follow along magnetic lines of
force, the large-scale braiding of field lines in space allows the fast-moving
electrons to interact with the shock front and get accelerated multiple times.
Ripples in the shock front occurring at various scales will also contribute to
the acceleration by mirroring the electrons. Our calculation shows that this
process favors electron acceleration at perpendicular shocks. The acceleration
efficiency is critically dependent on the turbulence amplitude and coherence
length. We also discuss the implication of this study for solar energetic
particles (SEPs) by comparing the acceleration of electrons with that of
protons. Their correlation indicates that perpendicular shocks play an
important role in SEP events.

  A Contract-Theory Based Approach","30 Pages, 8 figures, 3 tables, journal",,,,"cs.NI cs.MA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  User cooperation although improves performance of wireless systems, it
requires incentives for the potential cooperating nodes to spend their energy
acting as relays. Moreover, these potential relays are better informed than the
source about their transmission costs, which depend on the exact channel
conditions on their relay-destination links. This results in asymmetry of
available information between the source and the relays. In this paper, we use
contract theory to tackle the problem of relay selection under asymmetric
information in OFDM-based cooperative wireless system that employs
decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. We first design incentive compatible
offers/contracts, consisting of a menu of payments and desired
signal-to-noise-ratios (SNR)s at the destination and then the source broadcasts
this menu to nearby mobile nodes. The nearby mobile nodes who are willing to
relay notify back the source with the contracts they are willing to accept in
each subcarrier. We show that when the source is under a budget constraint, the
problem of relay selection in each subcarrier in order to maximize the capacity
is a nonlinear non-separable knapsack problem. We propose a heuristic relay
selection scheme to solve this problem. We compare the performance of our
overall mechanism and the heuristic solution with a simple relay selection
scheme and selected numerical results showed that our solution performs better
and is close to optimal. The overall mechanism introduced in this paper is
simple to implement, requires limited interaction with potential relays and
hence requires minimal signalling overhead.

population in clusters, the destruction of galaxies by mergers and tides, and
the evolution of the intracluster light. We find that destruction of galaxies
by mergers dominates over destruction by tides by about an order of magnitude
at all redshifts. However, tidal destruction is sufficient to produce
intracluster light fractions f_ICL that are sufficiently high to match
observations. The bulk of the intracluster light (60%) is provided by
intermediate galaxies of total masses 10^11 Msun-10^12 Msun and stellar masses
6x10^8 Msun-3x10^10 Msun that were tidally destroyed by even more massive
galaxies. The contribution of low-mass galaxies to the intracluster light is
small and the contribution of dwarf galaxies is negligible, even though, by
numbers, most galaxies that are tidally destroyed are dwarfs. Tracking clusters
back in time, we find that their values of f_ICL tend to increase over time,
but can experience sudden changes that are sometimes non-monotonic. These
changes occur during major mergers involving clusters of comparable masses but
very different intracluster luminosities. Most of the tidal destruction events
take place in the central regions of clusters. As a result, the intracluster
light is more centrally concentrated than the galactic light. Our results

consider an absorptive/reflective medium having the complex refractive index
n_2+ik_2, submerged in a transparent dielectric of refractive index n_1,

the impedance-mismatch between the two media, which mismatch is dependent on

the full WMAP 7-yr temperature and polarization data, the type Ia supernova
data from Union2.1 sample, the baryon acoustic oscillation data from SDSS DR7

To deal with the perturbations of dark energy, we adopt the parameterized
post-Friedmann method. We find that, for the simplest holographic dark energy
model without spatial curvature and massive neutrinos, the phenomenological
parameter $c<1$ at more than $4\sigma$ confidence level. The inclusion of
spatial curvature enlarges the error bars and leads to $c<1$ only in about
$2.5\sigma$ range; in contrast, the inclusion of massive neutrinos does not
have significant influence on $c$. We also find that, for the holographic dark
energy model with spatial curvature but without massive neutrinos, the
$3\sigma$ error bars of the current fractional curvature density $\Omega_{k0}$
are still in order of $10^{-2}$; for the model with massive neutrinos but
without spatial curvature, the $2\sigma$ upper bound of the total mass of
neutrinos is $\sum m_{\nu} < 0.48$ eV. Moreover, there exists clear degeneracy
between spatial curvature and massive neutrinos in the holographic dark energy
model, which enlarges the upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu}$ by more than 2 times.
In addition, we demonstrate that, making use of the full WMAP data can give
better constraints on the holographic dark energy model, compared with the case
using the WMAP ``distance priors''.

our definition of scaling regularity and scaling zeta functions motivated by
geometric zeta functions and, in particular, partition zeta functions. Some of

Specifically, scaling zeta functions generalize partition zeta functions when

partitions determined by the self-similar system in question. Moreover, in
certain cases, self-similar measures can be shown to exhibit lattice or
nonlattice structure with respect to specified scaling regularity values.

natural evolution, in which there is no final objective. Yet the pursuit of
objectives is ubiquitous in simulated evolution. A significant problem is that
objective approaches assume that intermediate stepping stones will increasingly
resemble the final objective when in fact they often do not. The consequence is
that while solutions may exist, searching for such objectives may not discover
them. This paper highlights the importance of leveraging human insight during
search as an alternative to articulating explicit objectives. In particular, a
new approach called novelty-assisted interactive evolutionary computation
(NA-IEC) combines human intuition with novelty search for the first time to
facilitate the serendipitous discovery of agent behaviors. In this approach,
the human user directs evolution by selecting what is interesting from the
on-screen population of behaviors. However, unlike in typical IEC, the user can
now request that the next generation be filled with novel descendants. The
experimental results demonstrate that combining human insight with novelty
search finds solutions significantly faster and at lower genomic complexities
than fully-automated processes, including pure novelty search, suggesting an
important role for human users in the search for solutions.

Several new physics models have been proposed to explain this deviation. We
consider the consistency of the parameter space of vector unparticle (in
Flavor-Conserving scenario) with the existing $t\bar{t}$ production
measurements. In particular, we look at the total cross sections at the LHC and
Tevatron, differential cross section with $t\bar{t}$ invariant mass, and the
LHC charge asymmetry to identify the regions in parameter space that can give
the desired top $A_{\text{FB}}$ observed by the Tevatron. We show that in spite
of the intrinsic tension between the LHC charge asymmetry and $A_{\text{FB}}$,
there exists a region in the unparticle parameters space where the top
$A_{\text{FB}}$ and the LHC charge asymmetry are satisfied simultaneously.
Finally, we show that the consistent region with $t\bar{t}$ observables is
consistent with the constraints coming from the dijet resonance searches.

It combines the Monte Carlo method for star cluster evolution and the Fewbody
code to perform scattering experiments. The Fewbody was added in order to track
more precisely dynamical interactions between objects which can lead to
creations of various exotic objects observed in the star clusters, like Blue
Stragglers Stars (BSS). The MOCCA code is currently one of the most advanced
codes for simulating real size star clusters. It follows the star cluster
evolution closely to N-body codes but is much faster. We show that the MOCCA
code is able to follow the evolution of BSS with details. It is a suitable tool
to perform full scale evolution of real star clusters and detail comparison
with observations of exotic star cluster objects like BSS.
  This paper is the first one of the series of papers about properties of BSS
in star clusters. This type of stars is particularly interesting today, because
by studying them one can get important constrains on a link between the stellar
and dynamical evolution of star clusters. We discuss here first results
concerning BSS for an arbitrary chosen test model. We investigate properties of
BSS which characterize different channels of formation like masses, semi-major
axes, eccentricities, and orbital periods. We show how BSS from different
channels change their types, and discuss initial and final positions of BSS,
their bimodal distribution in the star cluster, lifetimes and more.

concentrations below optimal doping a pseudogap removes quasi-particle spectral
weight from parts of the Fermi surface, and causes a break-up of the Fermi

collapses on a universal function proportional to (hbar omega)^2+(1.5 pi k_B

quantum oscillations at low temperature and high magnetic field in underdoped

multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) switching scheme that enables data
exchange among multiple users. Here, a multi-antenna relay linearly precodes
the received (uplink) signals from multiple users before forwarding the signal
in the downlink, where the purpose of precoding is to let each user receive its
desired signal with interference from other users suppressed. The problem of
optimizing the precoder based on various design criteria is typically
non-convex and difficult to solve. The main contribution of this paper is a
unified approach to solve the weighted sum mean square error (MSE) minimization
and weighted sum rate maximization problems in MIMO switching. Specifically, an
iterative algorithm is proposed for jointly optimizing the relay's precoder and
the users' receive filters to minimize the weighted sum MSE. It is also shown
that the weighted sum rate maximization problem can be reformulated as an
iterated weighted sum MSE minimization problem and can therefore be solved
similarly to the case of weighted sum MSE minimization. With properly chosen
initial values, the proposed iterative algorithms are asymptotically optimal in
both high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes for MIMO switching,
either with or without self-interference cancellation (a.k.a., physical-layer
network coding). Numerical results show that the optimized MIMO switching
scheme based on the proposed algorithms significantly outperforms existing
approaches in the literature.

  Science on 27/7/2012",,"10.1007/s10509-012-1197-0",,"physics.gen-ph astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Galaxies and galaxy clusters have rotational velocities apparently too fast
to allow them to be gravitationally bound by their visible matter. This has
been attributed to the presence of invisible (dark) matter, but so far this has
not been directly detected. Here, it is shown that a new model that modifies
inertial mass by assuming it is caused by Unruh radiation, which is subject to
a Hubble-scale (Theta) Casimir effect predicts the rotational velocity (v) to
be: v^4=2GMc^2/Theta (the Tully-Fisher relation) where G is the gravitational
constant, M is the baryonic mass and c is the speed of light. The model
predicts the outer rotational velocity of dwarf and disk galaxies, and galaxy
clusters, within error bars, without dark matter or adjustable parameters, and
makes a prediction that local accelerations should remain above 2c^2/Theta at a
galaxy's edge.

"1207.7064","Richard Healey","Richard Healey","How to use quantum theory locally to explain ""non-local"" correlations",,,,,"quant-ph physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  J.S. Bell's work has convinced many that correlations in violation of CHSH
inequalities show that the world itself is non-local, and that there is an
apparently essential conflict between any sharp formulation of quantum theory
and relativity. Against this consensus, this paper argues that there is no
conflict between quantum theory and relativity. Quantum theory itself helps us
explain such (otherwise) puzzling correlations in a way that contradicts
neither Bell's intuitive locality principle nor his local causality condition.
The argument depends on understanding quantum theory along pragmatist lines,
and on a more general view of how that theory helps us explain. Quantum theory
is compatible with Bell's intuitive locality principle and with his local
causality condition not because it conforms to them, but because they are
simply inapplicable to quantum theory, as so understood.

  Applications Conference, ACSAC'2012",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper a novel system for detecting meaningful deviations in a mobile
application's network behavior is proposed. The main goal of the proposed
system is to protect mobile device users and cellular infrastructure companies
from malicious applications. The new system is capable of: (1) identifying
malicious attacks or masquerading applications installed on a mobile device,
and (2) identifying republishing of popular applications injected with a
malicious code. The detection is performed based on the application's network
traffic patterns only. For each application two types of models are learned.
The first model, local, represents the personal traffic pattern for each user
using an application and is learned on the device. The second model,
collaborative, represents traffic patterns of numerous users using an
application and is learned on the system server. Machine-learning methods are
used for learning and detection purposes. This paper focuses on methods
utilized for local (i.e., on mobile device) learning and detection of
deviations from the normal application's behavior. These methods were
implemented and evaluated on Android devices. The evaluation experiments
demonstrate that: (1) various applications have specific network traffic
patterns and certain application categories can be distinguishable by their
network patterns, (2) different levels of deviations from normal behavior can
be detected accurately, and (3) local learning is feasible and has a low
performance overhead on mobile devices.

such a process, we find the relation between the coupling constant g(2D) in
QCD2 and the coupling constant $g(4D)$ in QCD4. We also show that quarks and
gluons in QCD2 acquire masses as a result of the compactification.
