a topological insula- tor (TI) when it is considered as an open quantum system
in interaction with a noisy environment at a certain temperature T . As a
result, we find that protected end states in a TI become unstable and decay
with time. Very remarkably, the interaction with the thermal environment
(fermion-boson) respects chiral symmetry, which is the symmetry responsible for
the protection (robustness) of the end states in this TI when it is isolated
from the environment. Therefore, this mechanism makes end states unstable while
preserving their protecting symmetry. Our results have immediate practical
implications in recently proposed simulations of TI using cold atoms in optical
lattices. Accordingly, we have computed lifetimes of topological end states for
these physical implementations that are useful to make those experiments
realistic.

in a smooth, possibly unbounded, domain. Under suitable assumptions, we deduce
a condition on the size of the domain that implies the existence of a positive
solution satisfying a uniform pointwise estimate. Here, uniform means that the
estimate is independent of the domain. The main advantage of our approach is
that it allows us to remove a restrictive monotonicity assumption that was
imposed in the recent paper. In addition, we can remove a non-degeneracy
condition that was assumed in the latter reference. Furthermore, we can
generalize an old result, concerning semilinear elliptic nonlinear eigenvalue
problems. Moreover, we study the boundary layer of global minimizers of the
corresponding singular perturbation problem. For the above applications, our
approach is based on a refinement of a result, concerning the behavior of
global minimizers of the associated energy over large balls, subject to
Dirichlet conditions. Combining this refinement with global bifurcation theory
and the sliding method, we can prove uniform estimates for solutions away from
their nodal set. Combining our approach with a-priori estimates that we obtain
by blow-up, a doubling lemma, and known Liouville type theorems, we can give a
new proof of a known Liouville type theorem without using boundary blow-up
solutions. We can also provide an alternative proof, and a useful extension, of
a Liouville theorem, involving the presence of an obstacle. Making use of the
latter extension, we consider the singular perturbation problem with mixed
boundary conditions. Moreover, we prove some new one-dimensional symmetry and
rigidity properties of certain entire solutions to Allen-Cahn type equations,

robotic team satisfying a high level mission specification. Each robot in the
team is modeled as a weighted transition system where the weights have
associated deviation values that capture the non-determinism in the traveling
times of the robot during its deployment. The mission is given as a Linear
Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over a set of propositions satisfied at the
regions of the environment. Additionally, we have an optimizing proposition
capturing some particular task that must be repeatedly completed by the team.
The goal is to minimize the maximum time between successive satisfying
instances of the optimizing proposition while guaranteeing that the mission is
satisfied even under non-deterministic traveling times. Our method relies on
the communication capabilities of the robots to guarantee correctness and
maintain performance during deployment. After computing a set of optimal
satisfying paths for the members of the team, we also compute a set of
synchronization sequences for each robot to ensure that the LTL formula is
never violated during deployment. We implement and experimentally evaluate our
method considering a persistent monitoring task in a road network environment.

We demonstrate that the stars and star clusters that form naturally in the
inner regions of dwarfs are expected to migrate from the gas rich, star forming
centre to join the stellar spheroid. For dwarf galaxies, this process could be
the dominant source of halo stars. The effect is caused by stellar
feedback-driven bulk motions of dense gas which, by causing potential
fluctuations in the inner regions of the halo, couple to all collisionless
components. This effect has been demonstrated to generate cores in otherwise
cuspy cold dark matter profiles and is particularly effective in dwarf galaxy
haloes. It can build a stellar spheroid with larger ages and lower
metallicities at greater radii without requiring an outside-in formation model.
Globular cluster-type star clusters can be created in the galactic ISM and then
migrate to the spheroid on 100\thinspace Myr timescales. Once outside the inner
regions they are less susceptible to tidal disruption and are thus long lived;
clusters on wider orbits may be easily unbound from the dwarf to join the halo
of a larger galaxy during a merger. A simulated dwarf galaxy
($\text{M}_{vir}\simeq10^{9}\text{M}_{\odot}$ at $z=5$) is used to examine this
gravitational coupling to dark matter and stars.

function with a sparse prior on the unknown coefficients. These priors can
conveniently be expressed as a maximization over zero-mean Gaussians with
different variance hyperparameters. Standard MAP estimation (Type I) involves
maximizing over both the hyperparameters and coefficients, while an empirical
Bayesian alternative (Type II) first marginalizes the coefficients and then
maximizes over the hyperparameters, leading to a tractable posterior
approximation. The underlying cost functions can be related via a dual-space
framework from Wipf et al. (2011), which allows both the Type I or Type II
objectives to be expressed in either coefficient or hyperparmeter space. This
perspective is useful because some analyses or extensions are more conducive to
development in one space or the other. Herein we consider the estimation of a
trade-off parameter balancing sparsity and data fit. As this parameter is
effectively a variance, natural estimators exist by assessing the problem in
hyperparameter (variance) space, transitioning natural ideas from Type II to
solve what is much less intuitive for Type I. In contrast, for analyses of
update rules and sparsity properties of local and global solutions, as well as
extensions to more general likelihood models, we can leverage coefficient-space
techniques developed for Type I and apply them to Type II. For example, this
allows us to prove that Type II-inspired techniques can be successful
recovering sparse coefficients when unfavorable restricted isometry properties
(RIP) lead to failure of popular L1 reconstructions. It also facilitates the
analysis of Type II when non-Gaussian likelihood models lead to intractable
integrations.

underlying cost function is non-convex leading to an intractable, NP-hard
optimization problem. Consequently, the convex nuclear norm is frequently used
as a surrogate penalty term for matrix rank. The problem is that in many
practical scenarios there is no longer any guarantee that we can correctly
estimate generative low-rank matrices of interest, theoretical special cases
notwithstanding. Consequently, this paper proposes an alternative empirical
Bayesian procedure build upon a variational approximation that, unlike the
nuclear norm, retains the same globally minimizing point estimate as the rank
function under many useful constraints. However, locally minimizing solutions
are largely smoothed away via marginalization, allowing the algorithm to
succeed when standard convex relaxations completely fail. While the proposed
methodology is generally applicable to a wide range of low-rank applications,
we focus our attention on the robust principal component analysis problem
(RPCA), which involves estimating an unknown low-rank matrix with unknown
sparse corruptions. Theoretical and empirical evidence are presented to show
that our method is potentially superior to related MAP-based approaches, for
which the convex principle component pursuit (PCP) algorithm (Candes et al.,

violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. It is further demonstrated that
experimentally identifiable multiple energy scales are related to the scaling

scale parameter by evaluating cumulative sum of moving sample variances and
also by evaluating sample variance of preceding and succeeding moving sample

of Hurst parameter of selfsimilar processes. As an example we introduce simple
fractional Brownian motion (sfBm) which is semi-selfsimilar with stationary
increments. We present some simulations and numerical evaluation to illustrate

(NLTE) line formation calculations for Fe were performed using 1D hydrostatic
MARCS and MAFAGS-OS model atmospheres, as well as the spatial and temporal
average stratifications from full 3D hydrodynamical simulations of stellar

ionization balance can be well established with the 1D and mean 3D models under
NLTE including calibrated inelastic collisions with H I calculated from the
Drawin's (1969) formulae. Strong low-excitation Fe I lines are very sensitive
to the atmospheric structure; classical 1D models fail to provide consistent
excitation balance, particularly so for cool metal-poor stars. A better
agreement between Fe I lines spanning a range of excitation potentials is
obtained with the mean 3D models. Mean NLTE metallicities determined for the
standard stars using the 1D and mean 3D models are fully consistent. Also, the
NLTE spectroscopic effective temperatures and gravities from ionization balance

the physics of episodic accretion and the extent to which this phenomenon can
explain the luminosity distribution of protostars. We present new and archival
data for V2775 Ori (HOPS 223), a protostar in the L 1641 region of the Orion
molecular clouds that was discovered by Caratti o Garatti et al. (2011) to have
recently undergone an order-of-magnitude increase in luminosity. Our
near-infrared spectra of the source have strong blueshifted He I 10830
absorption, strong H2O and CO absorption, and no H I emission, all typical of
FU Orionis sources. With data from IRTF, 2MASS, HST, Spitzer, WISE, Herschel,
and APEX that span from 1 to 70 microns pre-outburst and from 1 to 870 microns
post-outburst, we estimate that the outburst began between 2005 April and 2007
March. We also model the pre- and post-outburst spectral energy distributions
of the source, finding it to be in the late stages of accreting its envelope
with a disk-to-star accretion rate that increased from about 2x10^-6 M_sun/yr
to about 10^-5 M_sun/yr during the outburst. The post-outburst luminosity at
the epoch of the FU Orionis-like near-IR spectra is 28 L_sun, making V2775 Ori
the least luminous documented FU Orionis outburster with a protostellar
envelope. The existence of low-luminosity outbursts supports the notion that a
range of episiodic accretion phenomena can partially explain the observed
spread in protostellar luminosities.

star S CrA N and test whether the observations agree with the standard picture
proposed for Herbig Ae stars.
  Methods: Our observations were carried out with the VLTI/AMBER instrument in
the H and K bands with the low spectral resolution mode. For the interpretation
of our near-infrared AMBER and archival mid-infrared MIDI visibilities, we
employed both geometric and temperature-gradient models.
  Results: To characterize the disk size, we first fitted geometric models
consisting of a stellar point source, a ring-shaped disk, and a halo structure
to the visibilities. In the H and K bands, we measured ring-fit radii of 0.73
+- 0.03 mas (corresponding to 0.095 +- 0.018 AU for a distance of 130 pc) and
0.85 +- 0.07 mas (0.111 +- 0.026 AU), respectively. This K-band radius is
approximately two times larger than the dust sublimation radius of ~0.05 AU
expected for a dust sublimation temperature of 1500 K and gray dust opacities,
but approximately agrees with the prediction of models including backwarming
(namely a radius of ~0.12 AU). The derived temperature-gradient models suggest
that the disk is approximately face-on consisting of two disk components with a
gap between star and disk. The inner disk component has a temperature close to
the dust sublimation temperature and a quite narrow intensity distribution with
a radial extension from 0.11 AU to 0.14 AU.
  Conclusions: Both our geometric and temperature-gradient models suggest that
the T Tauri star S CrA N is surrounded by a circumstellar disk that is
truncated at an inner radius of ~0.11 AU. The narrow extension of the inner
temperature-gradient disk component implies that there is a hot inner rim.

(energetic feedback from supernovae and subsequent tidal stripping)
significantly reduces the dark matter mass in the central regions of luminous
satellite galaxies. The reduced central masses of the simulated satellites
reproduce the observed internal dynamics of Milky Way and M31 satellites as a
function of luminosity. We use these realistic satellites to update predictions
for the observed velocity and luminosity functions of satellites around Milky
Way-mass galaxies when baryonic effects are accounted for. We also predict that
field dwarf galaxies in the same luminosity range as the Milky Way classical
satellites should not exhibit velocities as low as the satellites, since the
field dwarfs do not experience tidal stripping. Additionally, the early
formation times of the satellites compared to field galaxies at the same
luminosity may be apparent in the star formation histories of the two
populations. Including baryonic physics in Cold Dark Matter models naturally
explains the observed low dark matter densities in the Milky Way's dwarf
spheroidal population. Our simulations therefore resolve the tension between
kinematics predicted in Cold Dark Matter theory and observations of satellites,
without invoking alternative forms of dark matter.

redshift control samples from the literature to study evolutionary trends from
z=0 --> 5.33 (>12 Gyr). We observe a significant strengthening in the
characteristic N(HI) for fixed MgII equivalent width as one moves toward higher
redshift. Indeed at our sample's mean zbar=3.402, all MgII systems are either
damped Ly-alpha absorbers or sub-DLAs, with 40.7% of systems exceeding the DLA
threshold (compared to 16.7% at zbar=0.927). We set lower limits on the
metallicity of the MgII systems where we can measure HI; these results are
consistent with the full DLA population. The classical MgII systems
(W(2796)=0.3-1.0 Ang), which preferentially associate with sub-DLAs, are quite
metal rich at ~0.1 Solar. We applied quantitative classification metrics to our
absorbers to compare with low redshift populations, finding that weak systems
are similar to classic MgII absorbers at low redshift. The strong systems
either have very large MgII and FeII velocity spreads implying non-virialized
dynamics, or are more quiescent DLAs. There is tentative evidence that the
kinetically complex systems evolve in similar fashion to the global star
formation rate. We speculate that if weaker MgII systems represent accreting
gas as suggested by recent studies of galaxy-absorber inclinations, then their
high metal abundance suggests re-accretion of recently ejected material rather
than first-time infall from the metal-poor IGM, even at early times.

cosmological constraints from the large-scale structure. In the first approach
(method I), small-scale galaxy lensing measurements of their halo mass provide
a constraint on the halo bias, which can be combined with the large-scale
galaxy clustering to measure the dark matter clustering. In the second approach
(method II), large-scale galaxy clustering and large-scale galaxy-galaxy
lensing can be combined into a direct measurement of the dark matter
clustering. These two methods can be combined into one method I+II to make use
of lensing measurements on all scales. In the third approach (method III), we
add abundance information to the method I. We explore the statistical power of
these three approaches as a function of galaxy luminosity to investigate the
optimal mass range for each method and their cosmological constraining power.
In the case of the SDSS, we find that the three methods give comparable
constraints, but not in the same mass range: the method II works best for halos
of M~10^13 Msun, and the methods I and III work best for halos of M~10^14 Msun.
We discuss the robustness of each method against various systematics.
Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the future large-scale galaxy surveys
and find that the cluster abundance method is not superior to the combined
method I+II, both in terms of statistical power and robustness against
systematic errors. The cosmic shear-shear correlation analysis in the future
surveys yields constraints as strong as the combined method, but suffer from
additional systematic effects. We thus advocate the combined analysis of
clustering and lensing (method I+II) as a powerful alternative to other
large-scale probes. Our analysis provides a guidance to observers planning
large-scale galaxy surveys such as the DES, Euclid, and the LSST.

boson, after a combined analysis of the di-photon and ZZ search channels. This
observation has significant impact on low-energy supersymmetry. First, some
fine-tuning is necessary to accommodate such a Higgs mass in the Minimal
Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) because the tree-level mass of the SM-like
Higgs boson in the MSSM is relatively small. We study the possibility of
lifting the mass of the SM-like Higgs boson by non-decoupling D-term from an
additional U(1) gauge symmetry. In particular, we focus on a gauged
Peccei-Quinn symmetry which can also be related to a possible solution of the
mu problem in the MSSM. In addition to the measurement of the mass of the
Higgs, the data also reveals a tantalizing hint of a significantly enhanced
di-photon signal rate, 1.56 pm 0.43 and 1.9 pm 0.5 times of the SM prediction
in the CMS and ATLAS experiments, respectively. We demonstrate that such an
enhancement can be accommodated in this MSSM extension. Anomaly cancellation
requires the introduction of charged exotics. If some of them happen to be
light and have sizable coupling to the SM-like Higgs boson, the di-photon
signal rate can be enhanced significantly. EW precision measurements provide
stringent constraints on this model. Taking these into account, we identify two
benchmark scenarios. We argue that they are representative of large classes of
viable models beyond our current example which can consistently enhance the
Higgs to di-photon rate. We also comment on possible signals of such light
exotics at the LHC.

the latter are the mass function index and the minimal subhalo mass. We use
recent results from N-body simulations to set the most reasonable range of
parameters, and find that the signal can be boosted by a factor ranging from 2
to 15 towards the Galactic poles, slightly more towards the Galactic
anticenter, with an important dependence on the subhalo mass index. This
uncertainty is however much less than that of the extragalactic signal studied
in the literature. We derive upper bounds on the dark matter annihilation cross
section using the isotropic gamma-ray emission measured by Fermi-LAT, for two
directions in the sky, the Galactic anticenter and the Galactic pole(s). The
former represents the lowest irreducible signal from dark matter annihilation,
and the latter is robust as the astrophysical background, dominated by the
hadronic contribution, is rather well established in that direction. Finally,
we show how the knowledge of the minimal subhalo mass, which formally depends
on the dark matter particle interactions with normal matter, can be used to
derive the mass function index.

a blend with a stellar eclipsing binary either in the background/foreground or

higher false positive rate for the small, short-period Kepler planet candidates

concentration up to $x=0.15$, where additional competing magnetic orders appear
at low temperature. For $0.17 \leq x \leq 0.30$, the system experiences another
spin flop transition and recovers the low-$x$ spiral spin configuration. A
simple commensurate spin structure with $\vec{q}=(0.5,0,0)$ is found to coexist
with the incommensurate spiral order. The complex evolution of magnetic
structure in Co doped $\rm MnWO_4$ contrasts sharply with other transition
metal ion doped $\rm Mn_{1-x}A_xWO_4$ (A=Zn, Mg, Fe) where the chemical
substitutions stabilize only one type of magnetic structure. The rich phase
diagram of $\rm Mn_{1-x}Co_{x}WO_4 $ results from the interplay between
magnetic frustration and spin anisotropy of the Co ions.

survey of the Magellanic Clouds system (VMC) that provides photometry in the
YJKs bands and 12 epochs in the Ks band. The (Y-J) versus (J-Ks) diagram has
been used to distinguish QSO candidates from Milky Way stars and stars of the
Magellanic Clouds. Then, the slope of variation in the Ks band has been used to
identify a sample of high confidence candidates. These criteria were developed
based on the properties of 117 known QSOs presently observed by the VMC survey.
VMC YJKs magnitudes and Ks light-curves of known QSOs behind the Magellanic
system are presented. About 75% of them show a slope of variation in Ks>10^-4
mag/day and the shape of the light-curve is in general irregular and without
any clear periodicity. The number of QSO candidates found in tiles including
the South Ecliptic Pole and the 30 Doradus regions is 22 and 26, respectively,
with a ~20% contamination by young stellar objects, planetary nebulae, stars

periodic variable in the Orion Nebula Cluster. An extensive I-band photometric
data set of CHS7797 was compiled between 2004-2010 using various telescopes.
Further optical data have been collected in R and z' bands. In addition,
simultaneous observations of the ONC region including CHS7797 were performed in
the I, J, Ks and IRAC [3.6] and [4.5] bands over a time interval of about 40d.
CHS7797 shows an unusual large-amplitude variation of about 1.7 mag in the R,
I, and z' bands with a period 17.786. The amplitude of the brightness
modulation decreases only slightly at longer wavelengths. The star is faint
during 2/3 of the period and the shape of the phased light-curves for seven
different observing seasons shows minor changes and small-amplitude variations.
Interestingly, there are no significant colour-flux correlations for
wavelengths smaller than 2microns, while the object becomes redder when fainter
at longer wavelengths. CHS7797 has a spectral type of M6 and an estimated mass
between 0.04-0.1Msun. The analysis of the data suggests that the periodic
variability of CHS7797 is most probably caused by an orbital motion.
Variability as a result of rotational brightness modulation by spots is
excluded by the lack of any color-brightness correlation in the optical. The
latter indicates that CHS7797 is most probably occulted by circumstellar matter
in which grains have grown from typical 0.1 microns to 1-2 micron sizes. We
discuss two possible scenarios in which CHS7797 is periodically eclipsed by
structures in a disc, namely that CHS7797 is a single object with a
circumstellar disc, or that CHS7797 is a binary system, similar to KH15D, in
which an inclined circumbinary disc is responsible of the variability. Possible
reasons for the typical 0.3mag variations in I-band at a given phase are
discussed.

in globular clusters (GCs) there is still no unambiguous observational evidence
for their existence. The most promising signatures for IMBHs are found in the
cores of GCs, where the evidence now comes from the stellar velocity
distribution, the surface density profile, and, for very deep observations, the
mass-segregation profile near the cluster center. However, interpretation of
the data, and, in particular, constraints on central IMBH masses, require the
use of detailed cluster dynamical models. Here we present results from Monte
Carlo cluster simulations of GCs that harbor IMBHs. As an example of
application, we compare velocity dispersion, surface brightness and
mass-segregation profiles with observations of the GC M10, and constrain the
mass of a possible central IMBH in this cluster. We find that, although M10
does not seem to possess a cuspy surface density profile, the presence of an
IMBH with a mass up to 0.75% of the total cluster mass, corresponding to about
600 Msun, cannot be excluded. This is also in agreement with the surface
brightness profile, although we find it to be less constraining, as it is
dominated by the light of giants, causing it to fluctuate significantly. We
also find that the mass-segregation profile cannot be used to discriminate
between models with and without IMBH. The reason is that M10 is not yet
dynamically evolved enough for the quenching of mass segregation to take
effect. Finally, detecting a velocity dispersion cusp in clusters with central
densities as low as in M10 is extremely challenging, and has to rely on only
20-40 bright stars. It is only when stars with masses down to 0.3 Msun are
included that the velocity cusp is sampled close enough to the IMBH for a
significant increase above the core velocity dispersion to become detectable.

investigated is how the wave function changes for a symmetric Friedel-Anderson

volume (when the level spacing is smaller than the resonance width) the change
in the wave function can be expressed in terms of a universal single-electron

the number of electrons and independent of the parameters of the

Analogously, in this paper, we first define the second-order achievable rate

both reversible and irreversible reactions. Such systems are typical in
homogeneous combustion and heterogeneous catalytic oxidation. Most complex

no limit for irreversible reactions whereas the kinetic equations may have such
a limit. We represent the systems with irreversible reactions as the limits of
the fully reversible systems when some of the equilibrium concentrations tend
to zero. The structure of the limit reaction system crucially depends on the
relative rates of this tendency to zero. We study the dynamics of the limit
system and describe its limit behavior as $t \to \infty$. If the reversible
systems obey the principle of detailed balance then the limit system with some
irreversible reactions must satisfy the {\em extended principle of detailed
balance}. It is formulated and proven in the form of two conditions: (i) the
reversible part satisfies the principle of detailed balance and (ii) the convex
hull of the stoichiometric vectors of the irreversible reactions does not
intersect the linear span of the stoichiometric vectors of the reversible
reactions. These conditions imply the existence of the global Lyapunov
functionals and alow an algebraic description of the limit behavior. The
thermodynamic theory of the irreversible limit of reversible reactions is
illustrated by the analysis of hydrogen combustion.

study reward allocation amongst a collection of users/entities across
disciplines as diverse as economics, law and engineering. In network
engineering, this framework has been particularly insightful towards
understanding how Internet protocols allocate bandwidth, and motivated diverse
research efforts on distributed mechanisms to maximize network utility while
incorporating new relevant constraints, on energy, power, storage, stability,
etc., e.g., for systems ranging from communication networks to the smart-grid.
However when the available resources and/or users' utilities vary over time,
reward allocations will tend to vary, which in turn may have a detrimental
impact on the users' overall satisfaction or quality of experience.
  This paper introduces a generalization of NUM framework which explicitly
incorporates the detrimental impact of temporal variability in a user's
allocated rewards. It explicitly incorporates tradeoffs amongst the mean and
variability in users' reward allocations, as well as fairness. We propose a
simple online algorithm to realize these tradeoffs, which, under stationary
ergodic assumptions, is shown to be asymptotically optimal, i.e., achieves a
long term performance equal to that of an offline algorithm with knowledge of
the future variability in the system. This substantially extends work on NUM to
an interesting class of relevant problems where users/entities are sensitive to
temporal variability in their service or allocated rewards.

provide financial and societal benefits. One challenge in achieving efficient
building operation is the fact that few financial motivations exist for
encouraging low energy configuration and operation of buildings. As a result,
incentive schemes for managers of large buildings are being proposed for the
purpose of saving energy. This paper focuses on incentive design for the
configuration and operation of building-wide heating, ventilation, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, because these systems constitute the largest
portion of energy usage in most buildings. We begin with an empirical model of
a building-wide HVAC system, which describes the tradeoffs between energy
consumption, quality of service (as defined by occupant satisfaction), and the
amount of work required for maintenance and configuration. The model has
significant non-convexities, and so we derive some results regarding
qualitative properties of non-convex optimization problems with certain
partial-ordering features. These results are used to show that ""baselining""
incentive schemes suffer from moral hazard problems, and they also encourage
energy reductions at the expense of also decreasing occupant satisfaction. We
propose an alternative incentive scheme that has the interpretation of a
performance-based bonus. A theoretical analysis shows that this encourages
energy and monetary savings and modest gains in occupant satisfaction and
quality of service, which is confirmed by our numerical simulations.

double carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (WDs) is responsible for at least some Type
Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Previous (standard) studies of the anticipated SN
birthrate from this channel have assumed that the merger process is
conservative and that the primary criterion for explosion is that the merged
mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar mass. Han & Webbink (1999) demonstrated that
mass transfer and merger in close double WDs will in many cases be
non-conservative. Pakmor et al. (2011) further suggested that the merger
process should be violent in order to initiate an explosion. We have therefore
investigated how the SN Ia birthrate from the double-degenerate (DD) channel is
affected by these constraints. Using the binary-star population-synthesis
method, we have calculated the DD SN Ia birthrate under conservative and
non-conservative approximations, and including lower mass and mass-ratio limits
indicated by recent smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic calculations. The predicted
DD SN Ia rate is significantly reduced by all of these constraints. With
dynamical mass loss alone (violent merger) the birthrate is reduced to 56% of
the conservative rate. Requiring that the mass ratio $q>2/3$ further reduces
the birthrate to 18% that of the standard assumption. An upper limit of 0.0061
SNuM, or a Galactic rate of $4.6 \times 10^{-4}{\rm yr}^{-1}$, might be
realistic.

reported to be responsible for the generation of the effective field. However,
quantitative understanding of the effective field, including its direction with
respect to the current flow, is lacking. Here we show vector measurements of
the current induced effective field in Ta|CoFeB|MgO heterostructrures. The
effective field shows significant dependence on the Ta and CoFeB layers'
thickness. In particular, 1 nm thickness variation of the Ta layer can result
in nearly two orders of magnitude difference in the effective field. Moreover,
its sign changes when the Ta layer thickness is reduced, indicating that there
are two competing effects that contribute to the effective field. The relative

films under the influence of a transverse temperature gradient, which is
maintained by thermal baths across a direction perpendicular to the direction
of growth. Therefore, different longitudinal layers grow at different
temperatures between $T_1$ and $T_2$, where $T_1<T_c^{hom}<T_2$ and
$T_c^{hom}=0.69(1)$ is the critical temperature of films grown in homogeneous
thermal baths. We find a far-from-equilibrium continuous order-disorder phase
transition driven by the thermal bath gradient. We characterize this
gradient-induced critical behavior by means of standard finite-size scaling
procedures, which lead to the critical temperature $T_c=0.84(2)$ and a new
universality class consistent with the set of critical exponents $\nu=3/2$,
$\gamma=5/2$, and $\beta=1/4$. In order to gain further insight into the
effects of the temperature gradient, we also develop a bond model that captures
the magnetic film's growth dynamics. Our findings show that the interplay of
geometry and thermal bath asymmetries leads to growth bond flux asymmetries and
the onset of transverse ordering effects that explain qualitatively the shift
observed in the critical temperature. The relevance of these mechanisms is
further confirmed by a finite-size scaling analysis of the interface width,
which shows that the growing sites of the system define a self-affine
interface.

system integrates inference rules for propositional calculus and definitions.

law of force in conjunction with Maxwell's equations. We develop a theory of
the force exerted by a focused light beam on the free surface as well as within
the volume of a transparent dielectric medium. Although the medium can be
either solid or liquid, here we emphasize the application of the formulas to
liquids since, in principle at least, surface deformations and liquid motions
are measurable. Our theory predicts that, upon entering the liquid from the
free space, the beam of light exerts an outward vertical force on the entrance
surface that tends to produce a localized bulge. This surface force, however,
is much weaker than that predicted by prevailing theories and, in contrast to
current beliefs, is found to depend on the polarization state of the incident
beam. Within the volume of the liquid we predict that the forces of radiation
tend to create four counter-rotating vortices at the four corners of the
focused spot; the sense of rotation within these vortices depends on the
direction of the incident polarization. These striking departures from
conventional wisdom with regard to the force of radiation arise from a revision
in the form of the Lorentz law as applied to the bound charges/currents within
a dielectric medium.

interest to researchers. For example, for a search engine, the use of different
ranking algorithms may return different ranking lists. The effect of a ranking
algorithm can be estimated by computing the distance (similarity) between the
result ranking it returns and the appropriate ranking people expect. People may
be interested in only the first few items of result ranking, therefore the
metric for measuring the distance should emphasize on the items in higher
positions. Besides, in an extreme case, if a result ranking is the total
reverse of the expected ranking, then it is considered to be the worst ranking
with the maximum distance. Therefore, a metric is called for, which can satisfy
both of the two intuitions. To address this problem, we present a weighted
metric based on the classical Spearman's footrule metric to measure the
distance between two permutations of n objects. This metric can be applied in

through molecular Josephson junctions. The tunneling rates of electrons are
dominated by vibronic replicas of the superconducting gap, which show up as
prominent features in the differential conductance for the dc and ac current.
For relatively large molecule-lead coupling, a features that appears when the
Josephson frequency matches the vibron frequency can be identified with an
over-the-gap structure observed by Marchenkov et al. [Nat. Nanotech. 2, 481
(2007)]. However, we are more concerned with the weak-coupling limit, where
resonant tunneling through the molecular level dominates. We find that certain
features involving both Andreev reflection and vibron emission show an unusual
shift of the bias voltage V at their maximum with the gate voltage V_g as V ~
(2/3) V_g. Moreover, due to the polaronic effect, the ac Josephson current
shows a phase shift of pi when the bias eV is increased by one vibronic energy
quantum hbar omega_v. This distinctive even-odd effect is explained in terms of
the different sign of the coupling to vibrons of electrons and of
Andreev-reflected holes.

  Programs",,,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previous approaches to systematic state-space exploration for testing
multi-threaded programs have proposed context-bounding and depth-bounding to be
effective ranking algorithms for testing multithreaded programs. This paper
proposes two new metrics to rank thread schedules for systematic state-space
exploration. Our metrics are based on characterization of a concurrency bug
using v (the minimum number of distinct variables that need to be involved for
the bug to manifest) and t (the minimum number of distinct threads among which
scheduling constraints are required to manifest the bug). Our algorithm is
based on the hypothesis that in practice, most concurrency bugs have low v
(typically 1- 2) and low t (typically 2-4) characteristics. We iteratively
explore the search space of schedules in increasing orders of v and t. We show
qualitatively and empirically that our algorithm finds common bugs in fewer
number of execution runs, compared with previous approaches. We also show that
using v and t improves the lower bounds on the probability of finding bugs
through randomized algorithms.
  Systematic exploration of schedules requires instrumenting each variable
access made by a program, which can be very expensive and severely limits the
applicability of this approach. Previous work [5, 19] has avoided this problem
by interposing only on synchronization operations (and ignoring other variable
accesses). We demonstrate that by using variable bounding (v) and a static
imprecise alias analysis, we can interpose on all variable accesses (and not
just synchronization operations) at 10-100x less overhead than previous
approaches.

The model is constructed in the framework of supersymmetry, with a family

mechanism, while some standard model(SM) gauge group singlet fields are
included which transforms non-trivially under family symmetry. In the model,
each order of contributions are suppressed by $\delta \sim 0.1$ compared to the
previous one. In order to reproduce the mass hierarchy, $m_\tau$ and
$\sqrt{\Delta m_{atm}^2}$, $m_\mu$ and $\sqrt{\Delta m_{sol}^2}$ are obtained
at leading-order(LO) and next-to-leading-order(NLO) respectively, while

$\sin{\theta_{13}}=\displaystyle

analytically and numerically, the scaling behavior of the FPT distribution to a
given target node, averaged over all starting nodes. We find that random walks
arrive quickly at a local hub, and therefore, the FPT distribution shows a
crossover with respect to time from fast decay behavior (induced from the
attractive effect to the hub) to slow decay behavior (caused by the exploring
of the entire system). Moreover, the mean FPT is independent of the degree of
the target node in the case of compact exploration. These theoretical results
justify the necessity of using a random jump protocol (empirically used in
search engines) and provide guidelines for designing an effective network to

close to what is predicted by MHD simulations of turbulent ISM, provided the

between the inner and outer shell limits. Water maser clumps could be matched
at successive epochs separated by <2 years for AGB stars, or at least 5 years
for RSG. This is much shorter than the decades taken for the wind to cross the
maser shell, and comparison with spectral monitoring shows that some features
fade and reappear. In 5 sources, most of the matched features brighten or dim
in concert from one epoch to the next. One cloud in W Hya was caught in the act
of passing in front of a background cloud leading to 50-fold, transient
amplification. The masing clouds are 1-2 orders of magnitude denser than the
wind average and contain a substantial fraction of the mass loss in this
region, with a filling factor <1%. The RSG clouds are ~10x bigger than those
round the AGB stars. Proper motions are dominated by expansion, with no
systematic rotation. The maser clouds survive for decades (the shell crossing
time) but the masers are not always beamed in our direction. Radiative effects
cause changes in flux density throughout the maser shells on short timescales.
Cloud size is proportional to parent star size; clouds have a similar radius to
the star in the 22-GHz maser shell. Stellar properties such as convection cells

indefinite Sturm-Liouville operator \[ A=-(\sgn\, x)\frac{d}{wdx}\frac{d}{rdx}
\] acting in $L^2_{w}(-b,b)$. It is assumed that $w,r\in L^1_{\loc}(-b,b)$ are
even and positive a.e. on $(-b,b)$.
  The second object is the so-called HELP inequality
\[(\int_{0}^b\frac{1}{\tilde{r}}|f'|\, dx)^2 \le K^2
\int_{0}^b|f|^2\tilde{w}\,dx\int_{0}^b\Big|\frac{1}{\tilde{w}}\big(\frac{1}{\tilde{r}}f'\big)'\Big|^2\tilde{w}\,
dx, \] where the coefficients $\tilde{w},\tilde{r}\in L^1_{\loc}[0,b)$ are
positive a.e. on $(0,b)$.
  Both problems are well understood when the corresponding Sturm-Liouville
differential expression is regular. The main objective of the present paper is
to give criteria for both the validity of the HELP inequality and the
similarity to a self-adjoint operator in the singular case. Namely, we
establish new criteria formulated in terms of the behavior of the corresponding
Weyl-Titchmarsh $m$-functions at 0 and at $\infty$. As a biproduct of this
result we show that both problems are closely connected. Namely, the operator
$A$ is similar to a self-adjoint one precisely if the HELP inequality with
$\tilde{w}=r$ and $\tilde{r}=w$ is valid.
  Next we characterize the behavior of $m$-functions in terms of coefficients
and then these results enable us to reformulate the obtained criteria in terms
of coefficients. Finally, we apply these results for the study of the two-way
diffusion equation, also known as the time-independent Fokker-Plank equation.

  Processes, edited by Markus Aschwanden",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech nlin.AO physics.pop-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The statistics of natural catastrophes contains very counter-intuitive
results. Using earthquakes as a working example, we show that the energy
radiated by such events follows a power-law or Pareto distribution. This means,
in theory, that the expected value of the energy does not exist (is infinite),
and in practice, that the mean of a finite set of data in not representative of
the full population. Also, the distribution presents scale invariance, which
implies that it is not possible to define a characteristic scale for the
energy. A simple model to account for this peculiar statistics is a branching
process: the activation or slip of a fault segment can trigger other segments
to slip, with a certain probability, and so on. Although not recognized
initially by seismologists, this is a particular case of the stochastic process
studied by Galton and Watson one hundred years in advance, in order to model
the extinction of (prominent) families. Using the formalism of probability
generating functions we will be able to derive, in an accessible way, the main
properties of these models. Remarkably, a power-law distribution of energies is
only recovered in a very special case, when the branching process is at the
onset of attenuation and intensification, i.e., at criticality. In order to
account for this fact, we introduce the self-organized critical models, in
which, by means of some feedback mechanism, the critical state becomes an
attractor in the evolution of such systems. Analogies with statistical physics
are drawn. The bulk of the material presented here is self-contained, as only
elementary probability and mathematics are needed to start to read.

locked in an ""electron wave guide"" which is the consequence of multiple
magnetic scattering on diagonally running chains of Cu atoms with mutually
opposite spins, i.e. magnetic stripes. The oxygen holes lattice and the
magnetic stripes are confinements for moving conduction electrons and their
mutual modulation leads directly to pairs of parallel electron currents, which
are equivalent to moving pairs of electrons. This kind of electron currents can
exist as long as the antiferromagnetic background exists, i.e. up to the Curie
temperature. In turn, the oxygen hole lattice can exist as long as the Coulomb
forces balance the longitudinal and the transversal thermal displacements of
oxygen hole from their equilibrium positions in the hole lattice.

put to sleep for energy efficiency according to sleep scheduling approaches.
Any sleep scheduling scheme with its supporting protocols ensures that data can
always be routed from source to sink. In this paper, we investigate a problem
of multi-hop broadcast and routing in random sleep scheduling scheme, and
propose a novel protocol, called DQSB, by quasi-synchronization mechanism to
achieve reliable broadcast and less latency routing. DQSB neither assumes time
synchronization which requires all neighboring nodes wake up at the same time,
nor assumes duty-cycled awareness which makes it difficult to use in
asynchronous WSNs. Furthermore, the benefit of quasi-synchronized mechanism for
broadcast from sink to other nodes is the less latency routing paths for
reverse data collection to sink because of no or less sleep waiting time.
Simulation results show that DQSB outperforms the existing protocols in
broadcast times performance and keeps relative tolerant broadcast latency
performance, even in the case of unreliable links. The proposed DQSB protocol,
in this paper, can be recognized as a tradeoff between broadcast times and
broadcast latency. We also explore the impact of parameters in the assumption
and the approach to get proper values for supporting DQSB.

promising for mobile operators as it improves their network coverage and

introduces increased number of macro/femto handoff and wastage of electrical
energy which in turn may affect the system performance. Users moving with high
velocity or undergoing real-time transmission suffers degraded performance due
to huge number of unnecessary macro/femto handoff. On the other hand, huge
amount of electrical energy is wasted when a femto BS is active in the network
but remains unutilized due to low network load. Our proposed energy efficient
handoff decision algorithm eliminates the unnecessary handoff while balancing
the load of the macro and femto cells at minimal energy consumption. The
performance of the proposed algorithm is analyzed using Continuous Time Markov
Chain (CTMC) Model. In addition, we have also contributed a method to determine
the balanced threshold level of the received signal strength (RSS) from macro
base station (BS). The balanced threshold level provides equal load
distribution of the mobile users to the macro and femto BSs. The balanced
threshold level is evaluated based on the distant location of the femto cells
for small scaled networks. Numerical analysis shows that threshold level above
the balanced threshold results in higher load distribution of the mobile users

lifetime challenge of wireless sensor networks, as it can continuously harvest
energy from the environment. Unfortunately, it is challenging to guarantee a
satisfactory short-term performance in EH communication systems because the
harvested energy is sporadic. In this paper, we consider the channel training
optimization problem in EH communication systems, i.e., how to obtain accurate
channel state information to improve the communication performance. In contrast
to conventional communication systems, the optimization of the training power
and training period in EH communication systems is a coupled problem, which
makes such optimization very challenging. We shall formulate the optimal
training design problem for EH communication systems, and propose two solutions
that adaptively adjust the training period and power based on either the
instantaneous energy profile or the average energy harvesting rate. Numerical
and simulation results will show that training optimization is important in EH
communication systems. In particular, it will be shown that for short block
lengths, training optimization is critical. In contrast, for long block
lengths, the optimal training period is not too sensitive to the value of the
block length nor to the energy profile. Therefore, a properly selected fixed
training period value can be used.

several timescales and for a large number of observables. Putting the pieces
together of this dynamical behavior is not an easy task and requires a detailed
understanding of the physical processes that control the temporal evolution of

disks are well described by standard $\alpha$-disk theory. This paper is the
first of a series that aims at studying the possibility of inferring several
disk and stellar parameters through the follow-up of various observables. Here
we study the temporal evolution of the disk density for different dynamical
scenarios, including the disk build-up as a result of a long and steady mass
injection from the star, the disk dissipation that occurs after mass injection
is turned off, as well as scenarios in which active periods are followed by
periods of quiescence. For those scenarios, we investigate the temporal
evolution of continuum photometric observables using a 3-D non-LTE radiative
transfer code. We show that lightcurves for different wavelengths are specific
of a mass loss history, inclination angle and $\alpha$ viscosity parameter. The
diagnostic potential of those lightcurves is also discussed.

prominent clumps of H_alpha emitters, one surrounding the radio galaxy and
another located at ~1.5 Mpc away to the south-west, and the other located in

together in the near future and may grow to a single more massive cluster at

faint end of the red sequence, and they tend to be located in the high density

H_alpha emitters between the dense clumps and the other regions, suggesting
that this is one of the notable sites where the progenitors of massive galaxies

find that H_alpha emission of the radio galaxy is fairly extended spatially

the Lya emission is indeed severely extended by resonant scattering.

is to index $\cal{D}$ such that when a pattern $P$ of length $p$, and a
parameter $k$ come as a query, the index returns the $k$ most relevant
documents to the pattern $P$. Hon et. al. \cite{HSV09} gave the first linear
space framework to solve this problem in $O(p + k\log k)$ time. This was
improved by Navarro and Nekrich \cite{NN12} to $O(p + k)$. These results are
powerful enough to support arbitrary relevance functions like frequency,
proximity, PageRank, etc. In many applications like desktop or email search,
the data resides on disk and hence disk-bound indexes are needed. Despite of
continued progress on this problem in terms of theoretical, practical and
compression aspects, any non-trivial bounds in external memory model have so
far been elusive. Internal memory (or RAM) solution to this problem decomposes
the problem into $O(p)$ subproblems and thus incurs the additive factor of
$O(p)$. In external memory, these approaches will lead to $O(p)$ I/Os instead
of optimal $O(p/B)$ I/O term where $B$ is the block-size. We re-interpret the
problem independent of $p$, as interval stabbing with priority over tree-shaped

top-$k$ queries (with unsorted outputs) in near optimal $O(p/B + \log_B n +

invariance. Unlike for Euclidean monopoles, the formulae for the squared Higgs

Active tag requires a power source that's why its cost is more than passive

privacy. Some solutions utilize expensive cryptographic primitives such as hash
or encryption functions, and some lightweight approaches have been reported to
be not secure.
  This paper describes a lightweight Mutual authentication and ownership

LFSRs are very efficient in hardware and particularly suitable for the low-cost
RFID tags. To functioning security in low cost RFID tag minimum gate
requirement is 2000 gates. To implement security protocols using PUF and LFSR

This monogamy bound holds either for pure or mixed quantum states provided that
bipartite quantum discord does not increase under discard of subsystems. We
illustrate the monogamy behavior for multipartite pure states with Schmidt
decomposition as well as for W-GHZ mixed states. As a by-product, we apply the

spatially homogeneous case. There the Einstein equations reduce to ordinary
differential equations and it becomes a statement that the solutions of the

of this kind rigorously was very slow but recently there has been new progress
in this area, particularly in the case of the vacuum Einstein equations. In
this paper we generalize some of these results to the Einstein-Maxwell

occurred on August 7 2010. Their corresponding results are presented and
compared, especially in their propagation direction and spatial extent in 3D.
We find that mask fitting and geometric localisation method produce consistent
results. Reconstructions including three-view observations are more precise
than reconstructions done with only two views. Compared to the forward modeling
method, in which a-priori shape of the CME geometry is assumed, mask fitting
has more flexibility. Polarisation ratio method makes use of the Thomson
scattering geometry. We find spatially the 3D CME derived from mask fitting
lies mostly in the overlap region obtained with the polarisation method from
COR2 A and B. In addition, mask fitting can help resolve the front/back
ambiguity inherent in the polarisation ratio method. However, local correlation
tracking plus triangulation did not show a consistent result with the other
four methods. For reconstructions of a diffuse CME, when the separation angle
between STEREO A and B is large, finding two corresponding points in a STEREO
image pair becomes very difficult. Excluding the local correlation tracking
method, the latitude of the CME's centre of gravity derived from the other
methods deviates within one degree and longitude differs within 19 degrees.

fabrication of volume phase gratings (VPGs) in fused silica and gallium
lanthanum sulphide (GLS) glasses. The VPGs we fabricated had a spatial
frequency of 333 lines/mm. The optimum fused silica grating was found to
exhibit a first order diffraction efficiency of 40 % at 633 nm, but exhibited
approximately 40 % integrated scattered light. The optimum GLS grating was
found to exhibit a first order diffraction efficiency of 71 % at 633 nm and
less than 5 % integrated scattered light. Importantly for future astronomy
applications, both gratings survived cooling to 20 K. This paper summarises the
grating design and ULI manufacturing process, and provides details of the
diffraction efficiency performance and blaze curves for the VPGs. In contrast
to conventional fabrication technologies, ULI can be used to fabricate VPGs in
almost any dielectric material, including mid-IR transmitting materials such as
the GLS glass used here. Furthermore, ULI potentially provides the freedom to
produce complex groove patterns or blazed gratings. For these reasons, we
believe that ULI opens the way towards the development of novel VPGs for future

micron, the width of the infrared bump, the near-infrared index and the
luminosity at 12.3 micron, all previously reported as possible diagnostic tools
to distinguish between the two dust distributions. We find that, due to the
different dust chemical compositions used in the two models, the behaviour of
the silicate features at 9.7 and 18 micron is quite distinct between the two
models. The width of the infrared bump and the peak of the infrared emission
can take comparable values, their distributions do, however, vary. The
near-infrared index is also quite different, due partly to the primary sources
adopted by the two models. Models with matched parameters do not produce
similar SEDs and virtually no random parameter combinations can result in

using the multi-component gas code SPEDI. The total mass ($M_{tot}$) is seen to
give an approximate stability condition for power law IMFs with fixed values of
$m_{max}$ and $m_{min}$ independent of $\alpha$. The value $M_{tot}/m_{max}
\simeq 12000$ is shown to give an approximate stability condition which is also
independent of $m_{max}$, though the critical value is somewhat higher for the
steepest IMF that was studied. For appropriately chosen cases, direct N-body
runs were carried out in order to check the results obtained from SPEDI.
Finally, evidence of the gravothermal nature of the oscillations found in the
N-body runs is presented.

molecules (PAHs) is studied for the variety of these molecules with different
numbers of condensed rings and over a broad range of electron temperatures,
using a multichannel quantum scattering approach. The calculations of the
relevant cross sections are used in turn to model the corresponding attachment
rates for each of the systems under study, and these rates are parametrized as
a function of temperature using a commonly employed expression for two-body
processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). AIM: The scope of this work is to
use first principles to establish the influence of chemical properties on the
efficiency of the electron-attachment process for PAHs. METHODS: Quantum
multichannel scattering methods are employed to generate the relevant cross
sections, hence the attachment rates, using integral elastic cross sections
computed over a broad range of relevant energies, from threshold up to 1000 K
and linking the attachment to low-energy resonant collisions. RESULTS: The
rates obtained for the present molecules are found to markedly vary within the
test ensemble of the present work and to be lower than the earlier values used
for the entire class of PAHs anions, when modelling their evolutions in ISM
environments. The effects of such differences on the evolutions of chemical
networks that include both PAH and PAH- species are analysed in some detail and
related to previous calculations.

simple, and reduced-cost acquisition, by exploiting a sparse signal model. Most
notably, recovery of the signal by computationally efficient algorithms is
guaranteed for certain randomized acquisition systems. However, there is a
discrepancy between the theoretical guarantees and practical applications. In
applications, including Fourier imaging in various modalities, the measurements
are acquired by inner products with vectors selected randomly (sampled) from a
frame. Currently available guarantees are derived using a so-called restricted
isometry property (RIP), which has only been shown to hold under ideal
assumptions. For example, the sampling from the frame needs to be independent
and identically distributed with the uniform distribution, and the frame must
be tight. In practice though, one or more of the ideal assumptions is typically
violated and none of the existing guarantees applies.
  Motivated by this discrepancy, we propose two related changes in the existing
framework: (i) a generalized RIP called the restricted biorthogonality property
(RBOP); and (ii) correspondingly modified versions of existing greedy pursuit
algorithms, which we call oblique pursuits. Oblique pursuits are guaranteed
using the RBOP without requiring ideal assumptions; hence, the guarantees apply
to practical acquisition schemes. Numerical results show that oblique pursuits
also perform competitively with, or sometimes better than their conventional
counterparts.

observed column densities of HC3N are typically two orders of magnitude lower

repressive regimes, leading them to develop and deploy network-based censorship
mechanisms within their networks. Existing censorship circumvention systems
face different difficulties in providing unobservable communication with their
clients; this limits their availability and poses threats to their users. To
provide the required unobservability, several recent circumvention systems
suggest modifying Internet routers running outside the censored region to
intercept and redirect packets to censored destinations. However, these
approaches require modifications to ISP networks, and hence requires
cooperation from ISP operators and/or network equipment vendors, presenting a
substantial deployment challenge. In this report we propose a deployable and
unobservable censorship-resistant infrastructure, called FreeWave. FreeWave
works by modulating a client's Internet connections into acoustic signals that
are carried over VoIP connections. Such VoIP connections are targeted to a
server, FreeWave server, that extracts the tunneled traffic of clients and
proxies them to the uncensored Internet. The use of actual VoIP connections, as
opposed to traffic morphing, allows FreeWave to relay its VoIP connections
through oblivious VoIP nodes, hence keeping itself unblockable from censors
that perform IP address blocking. Also, the use of end-to-end encryption
prevents censors from identifying FreeWave's VoIP connections using packet
content filtering technologies, like deep-packet inspection. We prototype the
designed FreeWave system over the popular VoIP system of Skype. We show that
FreeWave is able to reliably achieve communication bandwidths that are
sufficient for web browsing, even when clients are far distanced from the
FreeWave server.

experiments highlight a close correlation between the adsorbate stretching
frequency and equilibrium bond length for a wide range of adsorption geometries
and substrate compositions. In this work, we study the origins of this
correlation, commonly known as Badger's rule, by deconvoluting and examining
contributions from the adsorption environment to the intramolecular potential
using first-principles calculations. Noting that intramolecular anharmonicity
is preserved upon CO chemisorption, we show that Badger's rule for adsorbed CO
can be expressed solely in terms of the tabulated Herzberg spectroscopic
constants of isolated CO. Moreover, although it had been previously established
using finite-cluster models that Badger's rule is not affected by electrical
conditions, we find here that Badger's rule breaks down when the electrified
surface is represented as a periodic slab. Examining this breakdown in terms of
anharmonic contributions from the effective surface charge reveals limitations
of conventional finite-cluster models in describing electrical conditions at

combinatorial valuations for complementary and substitutable goods, in three
auction environments: sequential auctions, simultaneous auctions, and the
Trading Agent Competition (TAC) Classic hotel auction design, a hybrid of
sequential and simultaneous auctions. The problem of bidding in sequential
auctions is formulated as an MDP, and it is argued that expected marginal
utility bidding is the optimal bidding policy. The problem of bidding in
simultaneous auctions is formulated as a stochastic program, and it is shown by
example that marginal utility bidding is not an optimal bidding policy, even in
deterministic settings. Two alternative methods of approximating a solution to
this stochastic program are presented: the first method, which relies on
expected values, is optimal in deterministic environments; the second method,
which samples the nondeterministic environment, is asymptotically optimal as
the number of samples tends to infinity. Finally, experiments with these
various bidding policies are described in the TAC Classic setting.

of a good set of clusters to be used in GBP has remained more of an art then a
science until this day. This paper proposes a sequential approach to adding new
clusters of nodes and their interactions (i.e. ""regions"") to the approximation.
We first review and analyze the recently introduced region graphs and find that
three kinds of operations (""split"", ""merge"" and ""death"") leave the free energy

the notion of ""weakly irreducible"" regions as the natural candidates to be
added to the approximation. Computational complexity of the GBP algorithm is
controlled by restricting attention to regions with small ""region-width"".
Combining the above with an efficient (i.e. local in the graph) measure to

algorithm for adding new regions bottom-up to the region graph. Experiments
show that this algorithm can indeed perform close to optimally.

Factored Latent Analysis is latent class analysis in which the observation
space is subdivided and each aspect of the original space is represented by a
separate latent class model. One could simply treat these factors as completely
independent and ignore their interdependencies or one could concatenate them
together and attempt to learn latent class structure for the complete
observation space. Alternatively, FLA allows the interdependencies to be
exploited in estimating an effective model, which is also capable of
representing a factored latent state. In this paper, FLA is used to learn a set
of factored latent classes to represent different modalities of observations of
tracked objects. Different characteristics of the state of tracked objects are
each represented by separate latent class models, including normalized size,
normalized speed, normalized direction, and position. This model also enables
effective temporal segmentation of these sequences. This method is data-driven,
unsupervised using only pairwise observation statistics. This data-driven and

  allocation in OFDMA Cellular networks",,"International Journal of Wireless & Mobile Networks (IJWMN) Vol.
  4, No. 3, June 2012",,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tremendous growth in the demand for wireless applications such as streaming
audio/videos, Skype and video games require high data rate irrespective of
user's location in the cellular network. However, the Quality of Service (QoS)
of users degrades at the cell boundary. Relay enhanced multi-hop cellular
network is one of the cost effective solution to improve the performance of
cell edge users. Optimal deployment of Fixed Relay Nodes (FRNs) is essential to
satisfy the QoS requirement of edge users. We propose new schemes for channel
partitioning and FRN placement in cellular networks. Path-loss, Signal to
Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) experienced by users, and effects of
shadowing have been considered. The analysis gives more emphasis on the
cell-edge users (worst case scenario). The results show that these schemes
achieve higher system performance in terms of spectral efficiency and also
increase the user data rate at the cell edge.
