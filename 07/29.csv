information geometry, the natural geometry of the space of probability
distributions. Dynamics requires additional structure. To evolve the
probabilities $P^k$, we introduce coordinates $S^k$ canonically conjugate to
the $P^k$ and a symplectic structure. We then seek to extend the metric
structure of information geometry, to define a geometry over the full space of
the $P^k$ and $S^k$. Consistency between the metric tensor and the symplectic
form forces us to introduce a K\""ahler geometry. The construction has notable
features. A complex structure is obtained in a natural way. The canonical
coordinates of the K\""ahler space are precisely the wave functions of quantum
mechanics. The full group of unitary transformations is obtained. Finally, one
may associate a Hilbert space with the K\""ahler space, which leads to the
standard version of quantum theory. We also show that the metric that we derive
here using purely geometrical arguments is precisely the one that leads to
Wootters' expression for the statistical distance for quantum systems.

Brandt proposed an extremely low memory FMG-FAS algorithm over 25 years ago
that has several attractive properties for reducing costs on modern - memory
centric -- machines and has not been developed to our knowledge. This method,
segmental refinement (SR), has very low memory requirements because the finest
grids need not be held in memory at any one time but can be ""swept"" through,
computing coarse grid correction and any quantities of interest, allowing for
orders of magnitude reduction in memory usage. This algorithm has two useful
ideas for effectively exploiting future architectures: improved data locality
and reuse via ""vertical"" processing of the multigrid algorithms and the method
of $\tau$-corrections, which allows for not storing the entire fine grids at
any one time. This report develops this algorithm for a model problem and a
parallel generalization of the original sweeping technique. We show that
FMG-FAS-SR can work as originally predicted, solving systems accurately enough
to maintain the convergence rate of the discretization with one FMG iteration,
and that the parallel algorithm provides a natural approach to fully exploiting
the available parallelism of FMG.

Employing a two-mode approximation, we systematically develop two cubic-quintic

ensuing dynamical system. Finally, we obtain a reduced canonical description
for the conjugate variables of relative population imbalance and relative phase

repulsive), only a symmetry breaking bifurcation can be identified, a
remarkable effect that emerges e.g. in the setting of repulsive cubic but
attractive quintic interactions is a ""symmetry restoring"" bifurcation. Namely,
in addition to the supercritical pitchfork that leads to a spontaneous symmetry
breaking of the anti-symmetric state, there is a subcritical pitchfork that
eventually reunites the asymmetric daughter branch with the anti-symmetric
parent one. The relevant bifurcations, the stability of the branches and their
dynamical implications are examined both in the reduced (ODE) and in the full

expresses the criterion for passing from one model to another without loss of

under such sufficient statistics. While this is well studied in the finite
sample size case, in the infinite case, we encounter technical problems
concerning the appropriate topologies. Here, we introduce notions of
parametrized measure models and tensor fields on them that exhibit the right

handle the topological issues and show that the Fisher metric and the
Amari-Chentsov tensor on statistical models in the class of symmetric 2-tensor
fields and 3-tensor fields can be uniquely (up to a constant) characterized by
their invariance under sufficient statistics, thereby achieving a full
generalization of the original result of Chentsov to infinite sample sizes.
More generally, we decompose Markov morphisms between statistical models in
terms of statistics. In particular, a monotonicity result for the Fisher

dominant multipath taps are widely separated in time, thereby resulting in a
large delay spread. Traditionally, accurate channel estimation is done by
sampling received signal by analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at Nyquist rate
(high-speed ADC sampling) and then estimate all channel taps with
high-resolution. However, traditional linear estimation methods have two mainly
disadvantages: 1) demand of the high-speed ADC sampling rate which already
exceeds the capability of current ADC and also the high-speed ADC is very
expensive for regular wireless communications; 2) neglect the inherent channel
sparsity and the low spectral efficiency wireless communication is unavoidable.
To solve these challenges, in this paper, we propose a high-resolution
compressive channel estimation method by using low-speed ADC sampling. Our
proposed method can achieve close performance comparing with traditional sparse
channel estimation methods. At the same time, the proposed method has following
advantages: 1) reduce communication cost by utilizing cheap low-speed ADC; 2)
improve spectral efficiency by extracting potential training signal resource.
Numerical simulations confirm our proposed method using low-speed ADC sampling.

replicated across different nodes. However the increasing volume of data to be
stored has motivated the introduction of erasure codes, a storage efficient
alternative to replication, particularly suited for archival in data centers,
where old datasets (rarely accessed) can be erasure encoded, while replicas are
maintained only for the latest data. Many recent works consider the design of
new storage-centric erasure codes for improved repairability. In contrast, this
paper addresses the migration from replication to encoding: traditionally
erasure coding is an atomic operation in that a single node with the whole
object encodes and uploads all the encoded pieces. Although large datasets can
be concurrently archived by distributing individual object encodings among
different nodes, the network and computing capacity of individual nodes
constrain the archival process due to such atomicity.
  We propose a new pipelined coding strategy that distributes the network and
computing load of single-object encodings among different nodes, which also
speeds up multiple object archival. We further present RapidRAID codes, an
explicit family of pipelined erasure codes which provides fast archival without
compromising either data reliability or storage overheads. Finally, we provide
a real implementation of RapidRAID codes and benchmark its performance using
both a cluster of 50 nodes and a set of Amazon EC2 instances. Experiments show
that RapidRAID codes reduce a single object's coding time by up to 90%, while
when multiple objects are encoded concurrently, the reduction is up to 20%.

substructures within dark matter halos. If the cold dark matter consists of
weakly interacting massive particles, their annihilation within these
substructures could lead to diffuse GeV emission that would dominate over the
annihilation signal of the host halo. In this work we search for GeV emission
from three nearby galaxy clusters: Coma, Virgo and Fornax. We first remove
known extragalactic and galactic diffuse gamma-ray backgrounds and point
sources from the Fermi 2-year catalog and find a significant residual diffuse
emission in all three clusters. We then investigate whether this emission is
due to (i) unresolved point sources; (ii) dark matter annihilation; or (iii)
cosmic rays (CR). Using 45 months of Fermi-LAT data we detect several new point
sources (not present in the Fermi 2-year point source catalogue) which
contaminate the signal previously analyzed by Han et al.(arxiv:1201.1003).
Including these and accounting for the effects of undetected point sources, we
find no significant detection of extended emission from the three clusters
studied. Instead, we determine upper limits on emission due to dark matter
annihilation and cosmic rays. For Fornax and Virgo the limits on CR emission
are consistent with theoretical models, but for Coma the upper limit is a
factor of 2 below the theoretical expectation. Allowing for systematic
uncertainties associated with the treatment of CR, the upper limits on the
cross section for dark matter annihilation from our clusters are more stringent
than those from analyses of dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way. We rule out the
thermal cross section for supersymmetric dark matter particles for masses as
large as 100 GeV (depending on the annihilation channel).

Tolerant Networks (DTNs). The proposed mechanism tackles a core problem of such
systems: how to induce coordination of DTN relays in order to achieve a target
performance figure, e.g., delivery probability or end-to-end delay, under a
given constraint in term of network resources, e.g., number of active nodes or
energy consumption. Also, we account for the realistic case when the cost for
taking part in the forwarding process varies with the devices' technology or
the users' habits. Finally, the scheme is truly applicable to DTNs since it
works with no need for end-to-end connectivity.
  In this context, we first introduce the basic coordination mechanism
leveraging the notion of a Minority Game. In this game, relays compete to be in
the population minority and their utility is defined in combination with a
rewarding mechanism. The rewards in turn configure as a control by which the
network operator controls the desired operating point for the DTN. To this aim,
we provide a full characterization of the equilibria of the game in the case of
heterogeneous DTNs. Finally, a learning algorithm based on stochastic
approximations provably drives the system to the equilibrium solution without
requiring perfect state information at relay nodes or at the source node and

accuracy of GW parameter estimation improves if we use available information
from EM data. We do this by investigating whether correlations exist between
the GW parameters that describe these binaries and whether some of these
parameters are also available from EM observations. We used verification
binaries, which are known as the guaranteed sources for eLISA and will test the
functioning of the instrument. We find that of the seven parameters that
characterise such a binary, only a few are correlated. The most useful result
is the strong correlation between amplitude and inclination, which can be used
to constrain the parameter uncertainty in amplitude by making use of the
constraint of inclination from EM measurements. The improvement can be up to a
factor of $\sim6.5$, but depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the source
data. Moreover, we find that this strong correlation depends on the
inclination. For mildly face-on binaries ($\iota \lesssim 45^{\circ}$), EM data
on inclination can improve the estimate of the GW amplitude by a significant
factor. However, for edge-on binaries ($\iota \sim 90^{\circ}$), the
inclination can be determined accurately from GW data alone, thus GW data can
be used to select systems that will likely be eclipsing binaries for EM

likely that the gas physical conditions that prevail in forming clusters,
largely determine the properties of stars that form and in particular the
initial mass function. We develop an analytical model to account for the
formation of low mass clusters and the formation of stars within clusters. The
formation of clusters is determined by an accretion rate, the virial
equilibrium and energy as well as thermal balance. For this latter both
molecular and dust cooling are considered using published rates. The star
distribution is computed within the cluster using the physical conditions
inferred from this model and the Hennebelle & Chabrier theory. Our model
reproduces well the mass-size relation of low mass clusters (up to few $\simeq
10^3$ M$_\odot$ of stars corresponding to about 5 times more gas) and an
initial mass function which is $i)$ very close to the Chabrier's IMF, $ii)$
weakly dependent on the mass of the clusters, $iii)$ relatively robust to (i.e.
not too steeply dependent on) variations of physical quantities as accretion
rate, radiation and cosmic rays abundances. The weak dependence of the mass
distribution of stars with the cluster mass results from the compensation
between varying clusters densities, velocity dispersions and temperatures all
inferred from first physical principles. This constitutes a possible
explanation for the apparent universality of the IMF within the Galaxy though
variations with the local conditions could certainly be observed.

no solutions at any time. The proof relies on a key result asserting that every

mixture of known results on barrelledness and two fundamental results of Banach
space theory (namely, a result of Pe{\l}czy\'nski on Banach spaces containing
$L_1(\mu)$ and the $\ell_1$-theorem of Rosenthal). Next, we introduce a natural
notion of weak-approximate solutions for the non-autonomous Cauchy-Peano

hyperbolic-parabolic problems with Neumann boundary conditions. More generally,
we study boundary layers with mixed Dirichlet--Neumann boundary conditions
where the number of Dirichlet conditions is fewer than the number of hyperbolic
characteristic modes entering the domain, that is, the number of boundary
conditions needed to specify an outer hyperbolic solution. We have shown
previously that this situation prevents the usual WKB approximation involving
an outer solution with pure Dirichlet conditions. It also rules out the usual
maximal estimates for the linearization of the hyperbolic-parabolic problem
about the boundary layer.
  Here we show that for linear, constant-coefficient, hyperbolic-parabolic
problems one obtains a reduced hyperbolic problem satisfying Neumann or mixed
Dirichlet--Neumann rather than Dirichlet boundary conditions. When this
hyperbolic problem can be solved, a unique formal boundary-layer expansion can
be constructed. In the extreme case of pure Neumann conditions and totally
incoming characteristics, we carry out a full analysis of the quasilinear case,
obtaining a boundary-layer approximation to all orders with a rigorous error
analysis. As a corollary we characterize the small viscosity limit for this
problem. The analysis shows that although the associated linearized hyperbolic

with superconducting flux qubits coupled to a cavity. A distinct feature of
this proposal is that since only qubit-cavity resonant interaction and
qubit-pulse resonant interaction are used, the gate can be performed much
faster when compared with the previous proposals. This proposal does not
require adjustment of the qubit level spacings during the gate operation. In
addition, neither uniformity in the qubit parameters nor exact placement of
qubits in the cavity is needed by this proposal.

K$_{0.3}$MoO$_3$ (blue bronze) and propose a novel theoretical description of
these results. The observed Fermi surface, with two quasi-one-dimensional
sheets, is consistent with a ladder material with a weak inter-ladder coupling.
Hence, we base our description on spectral properties of one-dimensional
ladders. The marked broadening of the ARPES lineshape, a significant fraction
of an eV, is interpreted in terms of spin-charge separation. A high energy
feature, which is revealed for the first time in the spectra near the Fermi
momentum thanks to improved energy resolution, is seen as a signature of a
higher energy bound state of soliton excitations on a ladder.

  and proper fractional chaotic systems through a novel non-Lyapunov approach","50 pages, 12 figures",,,,"nlin.CD math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identification of the unknown parameters and orders of fractional chaotic
systems is of vital significance in controlling and synchronization of
fractional-order chaotic systems. However there exist basic hypotheses in
traditional estimation methods, that is, the parameters and fractional orders
are partially known or the known data series coincide with definite forms of
fractional chaotic differential equations except some uncertain parameters and
fractional orders. What should I do when these hypotheses do not exist?
  In this paper, a non-Lyapunov novel approach with a novel united mathematical
model is proposed to reconstruct fractional chaotic systems, through the
fractional-order differential equations self-growing mechanism by some genetic
operations ideas independent of these hypotheses. And the cases of identifying
the unknown parameters and fractional orders of fractional chaotic systems can
be thought as special cases of the proposed united mathematical reconstruction
method in non-Lyapunov way. The problems of fractional-order chaos
reconstruction are converted into a multiple modal non-negative special
functions' minimization through a proper translation, which takes
fractional-order differential equations as its particular independent variables
instead of the unknown parameters and fractional orders. And the objective is
to find best form of fractional-order differential equations such that the
objective function is minimized. Simulations are done to reconstruct a series
of hyper and normal fractional chaotic systems. The experiments' results show
that the proposed self-growing mechanism of fractional-order differential
equations with genetic operations is a successful methods for fractional-order
chaotic systems' reconstruction, with the advantages of high precision and
robustness.

Gao's mathematical model is put and analysed in three sub-models, not only for
the unknown orders and parameters' identification but also for systems'
reconstruction of fractional chaos systems with time-delays or not. Then the
problems of fractional-order chaos' identification are converted into a
