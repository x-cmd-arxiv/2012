  Capture-Recapture",,,,,"q-bio.QM stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  Understanding space usage and resource selection is a primary focus of many
studies of animal populations. Usually, such studies are based on location data
obtained from telemetry, and resource selection functions (RSF) are used for
inference. Another important focus of wildlife research is estimation and
modeling population size and density. Recently developed spatial
capture-recapture (SCR) models accomplish this objective using individual
encounter history data with auxiliary spatial information on location of
capture. SCR models include encounter probability functions that are
intuitively related to RSFs, but to date, no one has extended SCR models to
allow for explicit inference about space usage and resource selection. We
develop a statistical framework for jointly modeling space usage, resource
selection, and population density by integrating SCR data, such as from camera
traps, mist-nets, or conventional catch-traps, with resource selection data
from telemetered individuals. We provide a framework for estimation based on
marginal likelihood, wherein we estimate simultaneously the parameters of the
SCR and RSF models.
  Our method leads to increases in precision for estimating population density
and parameters of ordinary SCR models. Importantly, we also find that SCR
models alone can estimate parameters of resource selection functions and, as
such, SCR methods can be used as the sole source for studying space-usage;
however, precision will be higher when telemetry data are available. Finally,
we find that SCR models using standard symmetric and stationary encounter
probability models produce biased estimates of density when animal space usage
is related to a landscape covariate. Therefore, it is important that space
usage be taken into consideration, if possible, in studies focused on
estimating density using capture-recapture methods.

  Multicellular Organisms","29 pages",,,,"q-bio.TO cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A computational theory and model of the ontogeny and development of bilateral
symmetry in multicellular organisms is presented. Understanding the origin and
evolution of bilateral organisms requires an understanding of how bilateral
symmetry develops, starting from a single cell. Bilateral symmetric growth of a
multicellular organism from a single starter cell is explained as resulting
from the opposite handedness and orientation along one axis in two daughter
founder cells that are in equivalent developmental control network states.
Several methods of establishing the initial orientation of the daughter cells
(including oriented cell division and cell signaling) are discussed. The
orientation states of the daughter cells are epigenetically inherited by their
progeny. This results in mirror development with the two founding daughter
cells generating complementary mirror image multicellular morphologies. The end
product is a bilateral symmetric organism. The theory gives a unified
explanation of diverse phenomena including symmetry breaking, situs inversus,
gynandromorphs, inside-out growth, bilaterally symmetric cancers, and the
rapid, punctuated evolution of bilaterally symmetric organisms in the Cambrian
Explosion. The theory is supported by experimental results on early embryonic
development. The theory makes precise testable predications.

constrained using current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, including
WMAP7 and SPT, to be less than 0.063 (0.11) at 68% (95%) confidence level.
Further, we consider the additional effect of the CMB-lensing amplitude,
curvature, effective number of relativistic species and massive neutrinos and
show that the bound from current data on {\beta} is already strong enough to be
rather stable with respect to any of these variables. The strongest effect is
obtained when we allow for massive neutrinos, in which case the bound becomes
slightly weaker, {\beta} < 0.084(0.14). A larger value of the effective number
of relativistic degrees of freedom favors larger couplings between dark matter
and dark energy as well as values of the spectral index closer to 1. Adding the
present constraints on the Hubble constant, as well as from baryon acoustic
oscillations and supernovae Ia, we find {\beta} < 0.050(0.074). In this case we
also find an interesting likelihood peak for {\beta} = 0.041 (still compatible
with 0 at 1{\sigma}). This peak comes mostly from a slight difference between
the Hubble parameter HST result and the WMAP7+SPT best fit. Finally, we show
that forecasts of Planck+SPT mock data can pin down the coupling to a precision
of better than 1% and detect whether the marginal peak we find at small non
zero coupling is a real effect.

accretion, which invoke disk-locking, using stellar and accretion parameters
derived from models of low resolution optical spectra of 36 T Tauri stars
(TTSs) in NGC 2264 (age~3 Myrs). Little evidence is found for models that
assume purely dipolar field geometries; however, strong support is found in the
data for a modified version of the X-wind model (Shu et al. 1994) which allows
for non-dipolar field geometries. The trapped flux concept in the X-wind model
is key to making the analytic predictions which appear supported in the data.
By extension, our analysis provides support for the outflows predicted by the
X-wind as these also originate in the trapped flux region. In addition, we find
no support in the data for accretion powered stellar winds from young stars. By
comparing the analysis presented here of NGC 2264 with a similar analysis of
stars in Taurus (age~1-2 Myr), we find evidence that the equilibrium
interaction between the magnetic field and accretion disk in TTS systems
evolves as the stars grow older, perhaps as the result of evolution of the
stellar magnetic field geometry. We compare the accretion rates we derive with
accretion rates based on U-band excess, finding good agreement. In addition, we
use our accretion parameters to determine the relationship between accretion
and H-beta luminosity, again finding good agreement with previously published
results; however, we also find that care must be used when applying this
relationship due to strong chromospheric emission in young stars which can lead
to erroneous results in some cases.

satellite combined with INTEGRAL, Swift/BAT data, and Fermi/LAT data. We then
model the overall spectral energy distribution including radio and infrared
data. The combined Suzaku, Swift and INTEGRAL data are represented by an
absorbed exponentially cut-off power-law with reflection from neutral material
with a photon index Gamma = 1.68+-0.03, a high-energy cut-off Ecut = 227+143-67
keV, a reflection component with R = 0.7+-0.3 and a Gaussian component to
account for the iron emission-line at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width of EW =
85+-11 eV. The X-ray spectrum appears dominated by thermal, Seyfert-like
processes, but there are also indications of non-thermal processes. The radio
to gamma-ray spectral energy distribution can be fit with a single-zone
synchrotron-self Compton model, with no need for an additional thermal
component. We suggest a hybrid scenario to explain the broad-band emission,

low star-formation efficiency threaded by a uniform magnetic field
perpendicular to its main axis. It harbors more than a hundred, mostly
quiescent, very chemically young starless cores. The cloud is, therefore, a
good laboratory to study the earliest stages of the star-formation process. We
aim to investigate the primordial conditions and the relation among physical,
chemical, and magnetic properties in the evolution of low-mass starless cores.
We used the IRAM 30-m telescope to map the 1.2 mm dust continuum emission of
five new starless cores, which are in good agreement with previous visual
extinction maps. For the sample of nine cores, which includes the four cores
studied in a previous work, we derived a Av to NH2 factor of
(1.27$\pm$0.12)$\times10^{-21}$ mag cm$^{2}$ and a background visual extinction
of ~6.7 mag possibly arising from the cloud material. We derived an average
core diameter of ~0.08 pc, density of ~10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$, and mass of ~1.7 Msun.
Several trends seem to exist related to increasing core density: (i) diameter
seems to shrink, (ii) mass seems to increase, and (iii) chemistry tends to be
richer. No correlation is found between the direction of the surrounding
diffuse medium magnetic field and the projected orientation of the cores,
suggesting that large scale magnetic fields seem to play a secondary role in
shaping the cores. The full abstract is available in the pdf.

abundance variations that cannot be explained by mixing, and thus the first
discovered to host multiple populations. It is also the first star cluster to
exhibit two subpopulations in the Na:O diagram with one being chemically
homogeneous while the second has an intrinsic spread that follows the

in $[0,1]$ of a lattice-dependent polynomial, it has recently been shown that
the notion of a critical polynomial can be extended to any periodic lattice.
The polynomial is computed on a finite subgraph, called the base, of an
infinite lattice. For any problem with exactly known solution, the prediction
of the bond threshold is always correct, regardless of the base chosen. For
unsolved problems, the polynomial is referred to as the generalized critical
polynomial and provides an approximation that becomes more accurate with

The polynomials are computed using the deletion-contraction algorithm, which
quickly becomes intractable by hand for more than about 18 bonds. Here, I
present generalized critical polynomials calculated with a computer program for
bases of up to 36 bonds for all the Archimedean lattices, except the kagome

understanding of recombination losses, we determined the SE parameters, i.e.
the ideality factor and the dark saturation current, from temperature dependent
static j/V-measurements on
poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)(P3HT):[6,6]-phenyl-C$_{61}$ butyric acid methyl

are directly related to charge carrier recombination and become also accessible
by transient photovoltage and photocurrent methods in the case of
field-independent charge carrier generation. Although determined in very
different ways, both SE parameters were found to be identical. The good
agreement of static and transient approaches over a wide temperature range
demonstrates the validity of the Shockley model for OSC based on material
systems satisfying the requirement of field-independent polaron-pair
dissociation. In particular, we were able to reproduce the photocurrent at
various light intensities and temperatures from the respective nongeminate
recombination rates. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the dark
saturation current $j_0$ allowed determining the effective band gap of the
photoactive blend perfectly agreeing with the literature values of the energy
onset of the photocurrent due to charge transfer absorption. We also present a

from the Sgr core to its trailing tail. Our systematic, large area sample shows
no evidence for significant rotation, a result at odds with the ~20 km/s
rotation required as an explanation for the bifurcation seen in the Sgr tidal
stream; the observed small (<= 4 km/s) velocity trend along primarily the major
axis is consistent with models of the projected motion of an extended body on
the sky with no need for intrinsic rotation. The Sgr core is found to have a
flat velocity dispersion (except for a kinematically colder center point)
across its surveyed extent and into its tidal tails, a property that matches
the velocity dispersion profiles measured for other Milky Way dwarf spheroidal

incompleteness and incorrect redshifts in spectroscopic surveys to photometric
redshift training and calibration and the resulting effects on cosmological

of the simulations is modeled after the upcoming Dark Energy Survey and the
spectroscopy is based on a low/intermediate resolution spectrograph with
wavelength coverage of 5500{\AA} < {\lambda} < 9500{\AA}. The principal
systematic errors that such a spectroscopic follow-up encounters are
incompleteness (inability to obtain spectroscopic redshifts for certain
galaxies) and wrong redshifts. Encouragingly, we find that a neural
network-based approach can effectively describe the spectroscopic
incompleteness in terms of the galaxies' colors, so that the spectroscopic
selection can be applied to the photometric sample. Hence, we find that
spectroscopic incompleteness yields no appreciable biases to cosmology,
although the statistical constraints degrade somewhat because the photometric
survey has to be culled to match the spectroscopic selection. Unfortunately,
wrong redshifts have a more severe impact: the cosmological biases are
intolerable if more than a percent of the spectroscopic redshifts are
incorrect. Moreover, we find that incorrect redshifts can also substantially
degrade the accuracy of training set based photo-z estimators. The main problem
is the difficulty of obtaining redshifts, either spectroscopically or
photometrically, for objects at z > 1.3. We discuss several approaches for

network, non-linear phenomena such as multiple stable equilibrium states and
spontaneous oscillations can occur. Such behavior has been observed or
predicted in a number of networks including the flow of blood through the
microcirculation, the flow of picoliter droplets through microfluidic devices,
the flow of magma through lava tubes, and two-phase flow in refrigeration
systems. While the existence of non-linear phenomena in a network with many
inter-connections containing fluids with complex rheology may seem
unsurprising, this paper demonstrates that even simple networks containing
Newtonian fluids in laminar flow can demonstrate multiple equilibria.
  The paper describes a theoretical and experimental investigation of the
laminar flow of two miscible Newtonian fluids of different density and
viscosity through a simple network. The fluids stratify due to gravity and
remain as nearly distinct phases with some mixing occurring only by diffusion.
This fluid system has the advantage that it is easily controlled and modeled,
yet contains the key ingredients for network non-linearities. Experiments and
3D simulations are first used to explore how phases distribute at a single
T-junction. Once the phase separation at a single junction is known, a network
model is developed which predicts multiple equilibria in the simplest of
networks. The existence of multiple stable equilibria is confirmed
experimentally and a criteria for their existence is developed. The network
results are generic and could be applied to or found in different physical

the gravitational waveforms from compact binary coalescences (CBCs). We do so
by the matched filtering of complete inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) signals
with a bank of inspiral-phase templates modeled after the 3.5 post-Newtonian
TaylorT1 approximant. The rationale for the choice of the templates is
threefold: (1) The inspiral phase of the Phenomenological signals, which are an
example of complete IMR signals, is modeled on the same TaylorT1 approximant.
(2) In the low-mass limit, where the merger and ringdown phases last much
shorter than the inspiral phase, the errors should tend to vanishingly small
values and, thus, provide an important check on the numerical aspects of our
simulations. (3) Since the binary black hole (BBH) signals are not yet known
for mass-ratios above ten and since signals from CBCs involving neutron stars
are affected by uncertainties in the knowledge of their equation of state,
inspiral templates are still in use in searches for those signals. The results
from our numerical simulations are compared with analytical calculations of the
systematic errors using the Fisher matrix on the template parameter space. We
find that the loss in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be as large as 60% even
for binary black holes with component masses m1 = 13M\odot and m2 = 20M\odot.
Also, the estimated total-mass for the same pair can be off by as much as 20%.
Both of these are worse for some higher-mass combinations. Even the estimation
of the symmetric mass-ratio {\eta} suffers a nearly 20% error for this example,
and can be worse than 50% for the mass ranges studied here. These errors
significantly dominate their statistical counterparts (at a nominal SNR of 10).
It may, however, be possible to mitigate the loss in SNR by allowing for
templates with unphysical values of {\eta}.

revisit the commons approach to unlicensed spectrum and try to show that a
commons can be basically regulated from the inside out. GT simulations of CR
interactions reveal the emergence of certain equilibria mirroring
behaviours/trends?. Once these ?trends identified, norms may be expressed and
then embedded into machines (CRs). Internalized norms may thus become the
alternative to external enforcement of rules. We call these emerging norms
techno-social norms (TSNs). TSNs could eventually become a means of regulating
the use of unlicensed spectrum and making open spectrum access feasible. Open
spectrum access scenarios are considered and analysis is performed based on
reformulations of two game theoretical models: Cournot and Bertrand. The
standard oligopoly models are reformulated in terms of radio resource access in
unlicensed bands. In order to capture the large variety of CR interaction
situations, several GT equilibrium concepts are considered: Nash, Pareto,
Berge-Zhukovskii, and Lorenz. In order to capture the heterogeneity of CR
interactions, the standard GT model is enriched allowing players to be biased
toward different types of equilibrium (or rationality). An evolutionary
game-equilibrium detection method is used. Numerical simulations bring relevant
insights on the problem of autonomy vs. regulation in emerging CR environments.
Relying on extensive GT simulations, some rules of behaviour - to be expanded
into techno-social norms - may be derived.

such as imaging bones, microcalcifications in the breast, mass lesions, and
calcified arteries. The obtained images may have a resolution of 0.7--0.8 mm.
Current VA systems based on confocal or linear array transducers generate
C-scan images at the beam focal plane. Images on the axial plane are also
possible, however the system resolution along depth worsens when compared to
the lateral one. Typical axial resolution is about 1.0 cm. Furthermore, the
elevation resolution of linear array systems is larger than that in lateral
direction. This asymmetry degrades C-scan images obtained using linear arrays.
The purpose of this article is to study VA image restoration based on a 3D
point spread function (PSF) using classical deconvolution algorithms: Wiener,
constrained least-squares (CLSs), and geometric mean filters. To assess the
filters' performance, we use an image quality index that accounts for
correlation loss, luminance and contrast distortion. Results for simulated VA
images show that the quality index achieved with the Wiener filter is 0.9 (1
indicates perfect restoration). This filter yielded the best result in
comparison with the other ones. Moreover, the deconvolution algorithms were
applied to an experimental VA image of a phantom composed of three stretched
0.5 mm wires. Experiments were performed using transducer driven at two
frequencies, 3075 kHz and 3125 kHz, which resulted in the difference-frequency
of 50 kHz. Restorations with the theoretical line spread function (LSF) did not
recover sufficient information to identify the wires in the images. However,
using an estimated LSF the obtained results displayed enough information to

modulation perpendicular to the propagation direction due to both angular
dispersion and the dispersion due to Bragg's law. The characteristic measure of

Both methods re- vealed that the UCDs are old (mean age 10.8 \pm 0.7 Gyr) and
(generally) metal-rich (mean [Fe/H] = -0.8 \pm 0.1). The alpha-element
abundances of the objects measured from the Lick indices are super-Solar.
  We used these measurements to test the hypothesis that UCDs are formed by the
tidal disruption of present-day nucleated dwarf elliptical galaxies. The data
are not consistent with this hypothesis because both the ages and abundances
are significantly higher than those of observed dwarf galaxy nuclei (this does
not exclude disruption of an earlier generation of dwarf galaxies). They are
more consistent with the properties of globular star clusters, although at
higher mean metallicity. The UCDs display a very wide range of metallicity
(-1.7 <[Fe/H]< 0.0), spanning the full range of both globular clusters and
dwarf galaxy nuclei.
  We confirm previous reports that most UCDs have high metalliticities for
their luminosities, lying significantly above the canonical
metallicitiy-luminosity relation followed by early-type galaxies. In contrast

breakup of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9, an event that occurred during a 1.33 Jupiter
radii encounter with that planet in July 1992. Tidal disruption of the comet
nucleus led to a chain of sub-nuclei about 100-1000 m in diameter; these went
on to collide with the planet two years later (Chodas & Yeomans 1996). They
were intensively studied prior to and during the collisions, making SL9 the
best natural benchmark for physical models of small body disruption. For the
first time in the study of this event, we use numerical codes treating
rubble-piles as collections of polyhedra (Korycansky & Asphaug 2009). This
introduces forces of dilatation and friction, and inelastic response. As in our
previous studies (Asphaug & Benz 1994,1996) we conclude that the progenitor
must have been a rubble-pile, and we obtain approximately the same pre-breakup
diameter (about 1.5 km) in our best fits to the data. We find that the
inclusion of realistic fragment shapes leads to grain locking and dilatancy, so
that even in the absence of friction or other dissipation we find that
disruption is overall more difficult than in our spheres-based simulations. We
constrain the comet's bulk density at about 300-400 kg/m^3, half that of our
spheres-based predictions and consistent with recent estimates derived from

  (IJCSIT). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1206.2058",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/publicdomain/","  During the past decades, to study high-dimensional data in a large variety of
problems, researchers have proposed many Feature Extraction algorithms. One of
the most effective approaches for optimal feature extraction is based on mutual
information (MI). However it is not always easy to get an accurate estimation
for high dimensional MI. In terms of MI, the optimal feature extraction is
creating a feature set from the data which jointly have the largest dependency
on the target class and minimum redundancy. In this paper, a
component-by-component gradient ascent method is proposed for feature
extraction which is based on one-dimensional MI estimates. We will refer to
this algorithm as Mutual Information Feature Extraction (MIFX). The performance
of this proposed method is evaluated using UCI databases. The results indicate
that MIFX provides a robust performance over different data sets which are
almost always the best or comparable to the best ones.

out to be positively correlated with the photon energy at the higher energy

energy below 13 keV and then decreases in the energy band of 13-20 keV. There
is no clear dependence on photon energy for the quality factor. Based on these

requires knowing how the ballots cast in an election are organized into groups,
for instance, how many containers of ballots there are in all and how many
ballots are in each container. A list of the ballot group identifiers along
with number of ballots in each group is called a ballot manifest. What if the
ballot manifest is not accurate? Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be
missing from the manifest, it is not necessary to make worst-case assumptions
about those ballots--for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of
missing ballots--to ensure that the audit remains conservative. Rather, it
suffices to make worst-case assumptions about the individual randomly selected
ballots that the audit cannot find. This observation provides a simple
modification to some risk-limiting audit procedures that makes them
automatically become more conservative if the ballot manifest has errors. The
modification--phantoms to evil zombies (~2EZ)--requires only an upper bound on
the total number of ballots cast. ~2EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically
larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring
more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors. This
ensures that the true risk limit remains smaller than the nominal risk limit.
On the other hand, if the manifest is in fact accurate and the upper bound on
the total number of ballots equals the total according to the manifest, ~2EZ
has no effect at all on the number of ballots audited nor on the true risk
limit.

them prone to singularities. Unfortunately, it is non-trivial to give a clear
physical interpretation to the Richardson-Gaudin variables because no physical
operator is directly related to the individual variables. Purpose: The purpose
of this paper is to shed more light on the critical behavior of the
Richardson-Gaudin equations, and how this is related to the product wave
structure of the Bethe Ansatz. Method: A pseudo-deformation of the quasi-spin
algebra is introduced, leading towards a Heisenberg-Weyl algebra in the
contraction limit of the deformation parameter. This enables an adiabatic
connection of the exact Bethe Ansatz eigenstates with pure bosonic multiphonon
states. The physical interpretation of this approach is an adiabatic
suppression of the Pauli exclusion principle. Results: The method is applied to
a so-called ""picket-fence"" model for the BCS Hamiltonian, displaying a typical
critical behavior in the Richardson-Gaudin variables. It was observed that the
associated bosonic multiphonon states change collective nature at the critical
interaction strengths of the Richardson-Gaudin equations. Conclusions: The
Pauli exclusion principle is the main responsible for the critical behavior of
the Richardson-Gaudin equations, which can be suppressed by means of a pseudo
deformation of the quasispin algebra.

mechanism for phage genome ejection \textit{in vivo}; the mechanism is

The latter is built on top of a large set of water microstates describing the
kinetic stability of local hydrogen-bond arrangements up to the second
solvation shell. In temperature space, the landscape displays three regions
with an overall different organization. At ambient conditions, the free-energy
surface is characterized by structural inhomogeneities with multiple,
structurally well defined, short-lived basins of attraction. Below around
ambient temperature, the liquid rapidly becomes homogeneous. In this regime,
the landscape is funneled-like, with fully-coordinated water arrangements at

temperature of maximal compressibility (Widom line) where the funnel becomes

and outflows emitted by young stellar objects can be used to trace the various
evolutionary stages they pass through as they evolve to become main sequence
stars.
  To understand the relevance of atomic and molecular cooling in shocks, and
how accretion and ejection efficiency evolves with the source evolutionary
state, we will study the far-infrared counterparts of bright optical jets
associated with Class I and II sources in Taurus (T Tau, DG Tau A, DG Tau B, FS
Tau A+B, and RW Aur).
  We have analysed Herschel/PACS observations of a number of atomic ([OI]63um,
145um, [CII]158um) and molecular (high-J CO, H2O, OH) lines, collected within
the OTKP GASPS. To constrain the origin of the detected lines we have compared
the FIR emission maps with the emission from optical-jets and
millimetre-outflows, and the line fluxes and ratios with predictions from shock
and disk models.
  All of the targets are associated with extended emission in the atomic lines
correlated with the direction of the optical jet/mm-outflow. The atomic lines
can be excited in fast dissociative J-shocks. The molecular emission, on the
contrary, originates from a compact region, that is spatially and spectrally
unresolved. Slow C- or J- shocks with high pre-shock densities reproduce the
observed H2O and high-J CO lines; however, the disk and/or UV-heated outflow
cavities may contribute to the emission.
  While the cooling is dominated by CO and H2O lines in Class 0 sources, [OI]
becomes an important coolant as the source evolves and the environment is
cleared. The cooling and mass loss rates estimated for Class II and I sources
are one to four orders of magnitude lower than for Class 0 sources. This
provides strong evidence to indicate that the outflow activity decreases as the
source evolves.

decade. In this paper, an EHD based drug delivery system is well designed,
which can be used to generate a single drug droplet as small as 2.83 nL in 8.5
ms with a total device of 2x2x3 mm^3, and an external supplied voltage of 1500
V. Theoretically, we derive the expressions for the size and the formation time
of a droplet generated by EHD method, while taking into account the drug supply
rate, properties of liquid, gap between electrodes, nozzle size, and charged
droplet neutralization. This work proves a repeatable, stable and controllable
droplet generation and delivery system based on EHD method.

universe governed by the extended nonlinear massive gravity, in which the
graviton mass is promoted to a scalar-field potential. The extra freedom of the
theory can lead to certain energy conditions violations and drive cyclicity
with two different mechanisms: either with a suitably chosen scalar-field
potential under a given Stuckelberg-scalar function, or with a suitably chosen
Stuckelberg-scalar function under a given scalar-field potential. Our analysis
shows that extended nonlinear massive gravity can alter significantly the
evolution of the universe at both early and late times.

butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) bulk heterojunction solar cells to analyze the
limitations of solar cell performance in pristine and annealed devices. From
the determined charge carrier decay rate under open circuit conditions and the
voltage dependent charge carrier densities n(V) the nongeminate loss current
jloss of the device is accessible. We found that jloss alone is sufficient to
describe the j-V characteristics across the whole operational range, for
annealed and, not yet shown before, also for the lower performing pristine
solar cells. Even in a temperature range from 300 K to 200 K nongeminate
recombination is found to be the dominant and, therefore, performance limiting
loss process. Consequently, charge photogeneration is voltage independent in
the voltage range studied.

with a suspended graphene membrane described by the Dirac model is
investigated. We show that a major impact on the thermal correction is made by
the size of the gap in the energy spectrum of graphene quasiparticles.
Specifically, if the temperature is much smaller than the gap parameter
(alternatively, larger or of the order of the gap parameter), the thermal
correction is shown to be relatively small (alternatively, large). We have
calculated the free energy of the thermal Casimir-Polder interaction of atoms
of He, Na, Rb, and Cs with graphene described by both the hydrodynamic and
Dirac models. It is shown that in exact computations using the Dirac model, one
should use the polarization operator at nonzero temperature. The computational
results for the Casimir-Polder free energy obtained in the framework of
hydrodynamic model of graphene are several times larger than in the Dirac model
within the separation region below 2$\mu$m. We conclude that the theoretical
predictions following from the two models can be reliably discriminated in
experiments on quantum reflection of different atoms on graphene.

a deeper understanding of their meaning. It was later believed that these units
may provide a link between quantum theory and gravity in a yet to be developed
theory of quantum gravity. I propose a model where the Planck units appear
naturally by assuming that the quantum vacuum can be gravitationally polarized
based on recent work on the gravitational properties of anti-particles. In
order to match the observed values, we arrive at Planck particle/anti-particle
pairs (micro black holes) with Planck masses that define the gravitational
constant in vacuum through gravitational polarization. This gives the Planck
mass a new important interpretation as indeed linking quantum fluctuations to
gravity by defining the gravitational constant. In addition, a better
understanding of why the Planck length is usually associated as the smallest
length in nature can be illustrated from another perspective.
