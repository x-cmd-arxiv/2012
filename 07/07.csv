Hamiltonian is a sum of local commuting projectors of bounded range. We
consider whether or not such a system has a zero energy ground state. To do
this, we consider the problem as a one-dimensional problem, grouping all sites
along a column into ""supersites""; using $C^*$-algebraic methods (Bravyi and
Vyalyi), we can solve this problem if we can characterize the central elements
of the interaction algebra on these supersite. Unfortunately, these central
elements may be very complex, making brute force impractical. Instead, we show
a characterization of these elements in terms of matrix product operators with
bounded bond dimension. This bound can be interpreted as a bound on the number
of particle types in lattice theories with bounded Hilbert space dimension on
each site. Topological order in this approach is related to the existence of
certain central elements which cannot be ""broken"" into smaller pieces without
creating an end excitation. Using this bound on bond dimension, we prove that
several special cases of this problem are in NP, and we give part of a proof
that the general case is in NP. Further, we characterize central elements that
appear in certain specific models, including toric code and Levin-Wen models,
as either product operators in the Abelian case or matrix product operators
with low bond dimension in the non-Abelian case; this matrix product operator
representation may have practical application in engineering the complicated
multi-spin interactions in the Levin-Wen models.

electrons $n=0.4$. It is shown that when the anisotropy is appropriately
chosen, the ground state is ferromagnetic with magnetic order perpendicular to
the anisotropy. The increasing of the ratio $\frac tU$, where $t$ is the
hopping parameter and $U$ is the Coulomb repulsion, decreases the Curie
temperature, and the system arrives at the quantum critical point $(T_C=0)$.
The result is obtained introducing Schwinger bosons and slave Fermions
representation of the electron operators. Integrating out the spin-singlet
Fermi fields an effective Heisenberg model with ferromagnetic exchange constant
is obtained for vectors which identifies the local orientation of the spin of
the itinerant electrons. The amplitude of the spin vectors is an effective spin
of the itinerant electrons accounting for the fact that some sites, in the
ground state, are doubly occupied or empty. Owing to the anisotropy, the magnon
fluctuations drive the system to quantum criticality and when the effective
spin is critically small these fluctuations suppress the magnetic order.

both phenomena may manifest similar features. X-ray data can help to determine
the real origin of the perturbation. We analyse the distribution and physical
properties of the hot gas in the Virgo cluster spiral galaxies NGC 4254 and NGC
4569, which indicate that the cluster environment has had a significant
influence on their properties. By performing both spatial and spectral analyses
of X-ray data, we try to distinguish between two major phenomena: tidal and ram
pressure interactions. We compare our findings with the case of NGC 2276, in
which a shock was reported, by analysing XMM-Newton X-ray data for this galaxy.
We use archival XMM-Newton observations of NGC 4254, NGC 4569, and NGC 2276.
Maps of the soft diffuse emission in the energy band 0.2 - 1 keV are obtained.
For the three galaxies, especially at the position of magnetic field
enhancements we perform a spectral analysis to derive gas temperatures and thus
to look for shock signatures. A shock is a signature of ram pressure resulting
from supersonic velocities; weak tidal interactions are not expected to
influence the temperature of the ionized gas. In NGC 4254, we do not observe
any temperature increase. This suggests tidal interactions rather than ram
pressure stripping. In NGC 4569 the radio polarized ridge shows a higher
temperature, which may indicate ram-pressure effects. For NGC 2276, we do not
find clear indications of a shock. The main driver of the observed distortions
is most likely tidal interaction. Determining gas temperatures via sensitive
X-ray observations seems to be a good method for distinguishing between ram
pressure and tidal interaction effects acting upon a galaxy.

interacting parts of these physical systems, the equations of motion are
discussed in this paper. The generally accepted claim is that both parts of

relating the velocity moments of an observable tracer population to the
underlying gravitational potential. This technique has recently been applied in
the search for Dark Matter in objects such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies where
the presence of Dark Matter is inferred via stellar velocities. A precise
account of the density is needed to constrain the expected gamma ray flux from
DM self-annihilation and to distinguish between cold and warm dark matter
models. Unfortunately the traditional method of fitting the second order Jeans
equation to the tracer dispersion suffers from an unbreakable degeneracy of
solutions due to the unknown velocity anisotropy of the projected system. To
tackle this degeneracy one can appeal to higher moments of the Jeans equation.
By introducing an analog to the Binney anisotropy parameter at fourth order,
beta' we create a framework that encompasses all solutions to the fourth order
Jeans equations rather than those in the literature that impose unnecessary
correlations between anisotropy of second and fourth order moments. The
condition beta' = f(beta) ensures that the degeneracy is lifted and we
interpret the separable augmented density system as the order-independent case
beta'= beta. For a generic choice of beta' we present the line of sight
projection of the fourth moment and how it could be incorporated into a joint
likelihood analysis of the dispersion and kurtosis. Having presented the
mathematical framework, we then use it to develop a statistical method for the
purpose of placing constraints on dark matter density parameters from discrete
velocity data. The method is tested on simulated dwarf spheroidal data sets
leading to results which motivate study of real dwarf spheroidal data sets.

found that in a non-supersymmetric SU(5) with the usual adjoint Higgs, but with
large non-minimal coupling to the curvature, there are flat directions that
might lead to inflation. Interestingly, the one of lowest energy breaks into
SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1), as suggested by gauge coupling unification. Further, we
show that this flat direction is stable against small fluctuations in other

magnetic and thermal properties reveals that substituting 4d Rh4+ (4d5) ions
for 5d Ir4+(5d5) ions in Sr2IrO4 directly reduces the SOI and rebalances the
competing energies so profoundly that it generates a rich phase diagram for
Sr2Ir1-xRhxO4 featuring two major effects: (1) Light Rh doping (0\leqx\leq0.16)
prompts a simultaneous and precipitous drop in both the electrical resistivity
and the magnetic ordering temperature TC, which is suppressed to zero at x =
0.16 from 240 K at x=0. (2) However, with heavier Rh doping (0.24< x<0.85
(\pm0.05)) disorder scattering leads to localized states and a return to an
insulating state with spin frustration and exotic magnetic behavior that only
disappears near x=1. The intricacy of Sr2Ir1-xRhxO4 is further highlighted by
comparison with Sr2Ir1-xRuxO4 where Ru4+(4d4) drives a direct crossover from
the insulating to metallic states.

KOI-13 is composed by two fast-rotating A-type stars of similar magnitude. One
of these two stars hosts a transiting planet discovered by Kepler. We obtained
new radial velocity measurements using the SOPHIE spectrograph at the
Observatoire de Haute-Provence that revealed an additional companion in this
system. This companion has a mass between 0.4 and 1 Msun and orbits one of the
two main stars with a period of 65.831 \pm 0.029 days and an eccentricity of
0.52 \pm 0.02. The radial velocities of the two stars were derived using a
model of two fast-rotating line profiles. From the residuals, we found a hint
of the stellar variations seen in the Kepler light curve with an amplitude of
about 1.41 km/s and a period close to the rotational period. This signal
appears to be about three order of magnitude larger than expected for stellar
activity. From the analysis of the residuals, we also put a 3-sigma upper-limit
on the mass of the transiting planet KOI-13.01 of 14.8 Mjup and 9.4 Mjup,
depending on which star hosts the transit. We found that this new companion has
no significant impact on the photometric determination of the mass of KOI-13.01
but is expected to affect precise infrared photometry. Finally, using dynamical
simulations, we infer that the new companion is orbiting around KOI-13B while
the transiting planet candidate is expected to orbit KOI-13A. Thus, the
transiting planet candidate KOI-13.01 is orbiting the main component of a
hierarchical triple system.

properties by coupling high-resolution numerical simulations with semi-analytic
modeling (SAM) of galaxy formation and evolution. EDE models are characterized
by a non-vanishing high-redshift contribution of dark energy, producing an
earlier growth of structures and a modification of large-scale structure
evolution. They can be viewed as typical representatives of non-standard dark
energy models in which only the expansion history is modified, and hence the
impact on galaxy formation is indirect. We show that in EDE cosmologies the
predicted space density of galaxies is enhanced at all scales with respect to
the standard LCDM scenario, and the corresponding cosmic star formation history
and stellar mass density is increased at high-redshift. We compare these
results with a set of theoretical predictions obtained with alternative SAMs
applied to our reference LCDM simulation, yielding a rough measure of the
systematic uncertainty of the models. We find that the modifications in galaxy
properties induced by EDE cosmologies are of the same order of magnitude as
intra-SAM variations for a standard LCDM realization (unless rather extreme EDE
models are considered), suggesting that is difficult to use such predictions
alone to disentangle between different cosmological scenarios. However, when
independent information on the underlying properties of host dark matter haloes
is included, the SAM predictions on galaxy bias may provide important clues on
the expansion history and the equation-of-state evolution.

separated in height by about 13 Mm. This ""double-decker"" configuration
sustained for days before the upper branch erupted with a GOES-class M1.0 flare
on 2010 August 7. Analyzing this evolution, we obtain the following main
results. 1) During hours before the eruption, filament threads within the lower
branch were observed to intermittently brighten up, lift upward, and then merge
with the upper branch. The merging process contributed magnetic flux and
current to the upper branch, resulting in its quasi-static ascent. 2) This
transfer might serve as the key mechanism for the upper branch to lose
equilibrium by reaching the limiting flux that can be stably held down by the
overlying field or by reaching the threshold of the torus instability. 3) The
erupting branch first straightened from a reverse S shape that followed the
polarity inversion line and then writhed into a forward S shape. This shows a
transfer of left-handed helicity in a sequence of writhe-twist-writhe. The fact
that the initial writhe is converted into the twist of the flux rope excludes
the helical kink instability as the trigger process of the eruption, but
supports the occurrence of the instability in the main phase, which is indeed
indicated by the very strong writhing motion. 4) A hard X-ray sigmoid, likely
of coronal origin, formed in the gap between the two original filament branches
in the impulsive phase of the associated flare. This supports a model of
transient sigmoids forming in the vertical flare current sheet. 5) Left-handed
magnetic helicity is inferred for both branches of the dextral filament. 6) Two
types of force-free magnetic configurations are compatible with the data, a
double flux rope equilibrium and a single flux rope situated above a loop
arcade.

action in a form which is manifestly invariant under electric-magnetic duality.
This is achieved by introducing new potentials through solving the constraints
of the Hamiltonian formulation. The price for making electric-magnetic duality
invariance manifest through this direct procedure is losing manifest Lorentz
invariance. Both theories admit supersymmetric extensions, which make the
bosonic fields and their corresponding fermionic partners to be parts of the
same geometrical object, a supermultiplet. We present in this paper the
supersymmetric extension of the manifestly electric-magnetic duality invariant
actions for the photon and the photino; and for the graviton and the gravitino.
In each case the spinor fields transform under electric-magnetic duality in a
chiral manner. For the spin-tree-half field, which possesses a gauge
invariance, it is necessary to bring in a spinor ""prepotential"". As in previous
cases the introduction of additional potentials to solve the constraints
increases the number of gauge invariances of the action, thus keeping the
number of degrees of freedom unaltered. The similarity in the formulations for
the photon-photino and graviton-gravitino systems is remarkable.

demonstrate, for the first time, that the $E_{peak,0}$ bears a very strong
correlation with the isotropic energy of the individual pulses, and hence, each

needed in order to use GRB pulses for cosmological purposes, we explore other

another sample of Fermi/GBM GRBs having bright, long and single/ separable
pulse(s) and fit the time-resolved spectra of the individual pulses with the
Band model and a model consisting of a blackbody and a power-law. Both these
models give acceptable fits. We find that the peak energy/ temperature always
decreases exponentially with fluence in the later part of a pulse. We

thermal bremsstrahlung radiation at radio continuum frequencies that could be
linked to some Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs). The main targets for this
investigation are SNRs expanding in high density environments. There are
several indicators of radio thermal bremsstrahlung radiation from SNRs, such as
a flattening at higher frequencies and thermal absorption at lower frequencies
intrinsic to an SNR. In this work we discuss the radio continuum properties of
3 SNRs that are the best candidates for testing our hypothesis of significant
thermal emission. In the case of SNRs IC443 and 3C391, thermal absorption has
been previously detected. For IC443, the contribution of thermal emission at 1
GHz, from our model fit is 3-57%. It is similar to the estimate obtained from
the thermal absorption properties (10-40% at 1 GHz). In the case of the 3C391
the conclusions are not so clear. The results from our model fit (thermal
emission contribution of 10-25% at 1 GHz) and results obtained from the low
frequency absorption (thermal contribution of 0.15-7% at 1 GHz) do not overlap.
For the SNR 3C396 we suggest that if previously detected thermal absorption
could be intrinsic to the SNR then the thermal emission (<47% at 1 GHz from our
model fit) could be significant enough to shape the radio continuum spectrum at
high frequencies. Polarization observations for these SNRs can constrain the
strength of a thermal component. Reliable observations at low frequencies (<100
MHz) are needed as well as more data at high radio frequencies (>1 GHz), in
order to make stronger conclusions about the existence of ""radio thermally
active"" SNRs.

analyze the light curves of the permitted Ha, Hb, optical Fe II line fluxes,
and the continuum flux in order to search for a time lag between them.
Additionally, in order to estimate the contribution of iron lines from
different multiplets, we fit the Hb and Fe II lines with a sum of Gaussian
components. We found that during the monitoring period the spectral variation
(F_max/F_min) of Ark 564 was between 1.5 for Ha to 1.8 for the Fe II lines. The
correlation between the Fe II and Hb flux variations is of higher significance
than that of Ha and Hb (whose correlation is almost absent). The permitted-line
profiles are Lorentzian-like, and did not change shape during the monitoring
period. We investigated, in detail, the optical Fe II emission and found
different degrees of correlation between the Fe II emission arising from

  1. We provide a lower bound of 1+ln 2~1.693 on the competitive ratio of any
randomized algorithm for the maximum cardinality matching problem, thus
improving on the currently best known bound of e/(e-1)~1.581 due to Karp,

ratio of 5.356 for maximum weight matching. This finding demonstrates the power
of randomization in this context, showing how to beat the tight bound of 3

Gauss map from the 3-torus to the 2-sphere, and show that the pairwise linking
numbers and Milnor triple linking number that classify the link up to link
homotopy correspond to the Pontryagin invariants that classify its generalized
Gauss map up to homotopy. This can be viewed as a natural extension of the
familiar fact that the linking number of a two-component link in 3-space is the
degree of its associated Gauss map from the 2-torus to the 2-sphere. When the
pairwise linking numbers are all zero, we give an integral formula for the
triple linking number analogous to the Gauss integral for the pairwise linking
numbers, but patterned after J.H.C. Whitehead's integral formula for the Hopf
invariant. The integrand in this formula is geometrically natural in the sense
that it is invariant under orientation-preserving rigid motions of 3-space,

  We focus on two combinatorial optimization problems, namely the Generalized

the second one is a generalization of the Assignment Problem for an arbitrary

evaluation. A broad spectrum of related subjects, covered in this research,
includes test bed generation and analysis, implementation and performance
issues, local search neighborhoods and efficient exploration algorithms,
metaheuristics design and population sizing in memetic algorithm.
  The most important results are obtained in the areas of local search and
memetic algorithms for the considered problems. In both cases we have
significantly advanced the existing knowledge on the local search neighborhoods
and algorithms by systematizing and improving the previous results. We have
proposed a number of efficient heuristics which dominate the existing
algorithms in a wide range of time/quality requirements.

Steep density gradients are considered, with scale lengths comparable to the
poloidal ion gyroradius, together with strong radial electric fields sufficient
to electrostatically confine the ions. Attention is restricted to relatively
weak ion temperature gradients (but permitting arbitrary electron temperature
gradients), since in this limit a delta-f (small departures from a Maxwellian
distribution) rather than full-f approach is justified. This assumption is in
fact consistent with measured inter-ELM H-Mode edge pedestal density and ion
temperature profiles in many present experiments, and is expected to be
increasingly valid in future lower collisionality experiments. In the numerical
analysis, the distribution function and Rosenbluth potentials are solved for
simultaneously, allowing use of the exact field term in the linearized
Fokker-Planck collision operator. In the pedestal, the parallel and poloidal
flows are found to deviate strongly from the best available conventional
neoclassical prediction, with large poloidal variation of a different form than
in the local theory. These predicted effects may be observable experimentally.
In the local limit, the Sauter bootstrap current formulae appear accurate at
low collisionality, but they can overestimate the bootstrap current near the
plateau regime. In the pedestal ordering, ion contributions to the bootstrap
and Pfirsch-Schluter currents are also modified.

a factor 2, thus lending credence to earlier conclusions drawn with respect to
the pinning mechanism. The comparable values of the experimental screening
current density and the zero-temperature critical current density reveals the
limited usefulness of the widely used ""interpolation formula"".

collisions collected at sqrt(s)=7 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. Fully
hadronic final states are selected based on the variable MT2, an extension of
the transverse mass in events with two invisible particles. Two complementary
studies are performed. The first targets the region of parameter space with
medium to high squark and gluino masses, in which the signal can be separated
from the standard model backgrounds by a tight requirement on MT2. The second
is optimized to be sensitive to events with a light gluino and heavy squarks.
In this case, the MT2 requirement is relaxed, but a higher jet multiplicity and
at least one b-tagged jet are required. No significant excess of events over
the standard model expectations is observed. Exclusion limits are derived for
the parameter space of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the
standard model, as well as on a variety of simplified model spectra.

communication at the highest rate at which information can be sent over the
channel with a negligible probability of error. In the shadow of this
definition, diversity receivers (such as selection combining, equal-gain
combining and maximal-ratio combining) and transmission techniques (such as
cascaded fading channels, amplify-and-forward multihop transmission) are
deployed in mitigating various performance impairing effects such as fading and
shadowing in digital radio communication links. However, the exact analysis of
ergodic capacity is in general not always possible for all of these forms of
diversity receivers and transmission techniques over generalized composite
fading environments due to it's mathematical intractability. In the literature,
published papers concerning the exact analysis of ergodic capacity have been
therefore scarce (i.e., only [1] and [2]) when compared to those concerning the
exact analysis of average symbol error probability. In addition, they are
essentially targeting to the ergodic capacity of the maximal ratio combining
diversity receivers and are not readily applicable to the capacity analysis of
the other diversity combiners / transmission techniques. In this paper, we
propose a novel moment generating function-based approach for the exact ergodic
capacity analysis of both diversity receivers and transmission techniques over
generalized composite fading environments. As such, we demonstrate how to
simultaneously treat the ergodic capacity analysis of all forms of both
diversity receivers and multihop transmission techniques.

abundance ([Fe/H] ~ -6) and a peculiar chemical composition that includes large
overabundances of C, N, and O with respect to iron. One important question is
whether the chemical abundances in this star reflect the chemical composition
of the gas cloud from which it was formed or if they have been severely
affected by other processes, such as dust-gas winnowing. Aims: We measure or
provide an upper limit to the abundance of the volatile element sulphur, which
can help to discriminate between the two scenarios. Methods: We observed HE
1327-2326 with the high resolution infra-red spectrograph CRIRES at the VLT to
observe the S I lines of Multiplet 3 at 1045 nm. Results: We do not detect the
S I line. A 3sigma$upper limit on the equivalent width (EW) of any line in our
spectrum is EW<0.66 pm. Using either one-dimensional static or
three-dimensional hydrodynamical model-atmospheres, this translates into a
robust upper limit of [S/H]<-2.6. Conclusions: This upper limit does not
provide conclusive evidence for or against dust-gas winnowing, and the evidence
coming from other elements (e.g., Na and Ti) is also inconclusive or
contradictory. The formation of dust in the atmosphere versus an origin of the
metals in a metal-poor supernova with extensive ""fall-back"" are not mutually
exclusive. It is possible that dust formation distorts the peculiar abundance
pattern created by a supernova with fall-back, thus the abundance ratios in HE
1327-2326 may be used to constrain the properties of the supernova(e) that
produced its metals, but with some caution.
