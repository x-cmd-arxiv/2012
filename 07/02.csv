products is possible. Here, we present a general spectral two-state rate theory
for ergodic dynamical systems in thermal equilibrium that explicitly takes into
account how the system is observed. The theory allows the systematic estimation
errors made by standard rate theories to be understood and quantified. We also
elucidate the connection of spectral rate theory with the popular Markov state
modeling (MSM) approach for molecular simulation studies. An optimal rate
estimator is formulated that gives robust and unbiased results even for poor
reaction coordinates and can be applied to both computer simulations and
single-molecule experiments. No definition of a dividing surface is required.
Another result of the theory is a model-free definition of the reaction
coordinate quality (RCQ). The RCQ can be bounded from below by the directly
computable observation quality (OQ), thus providing a measure allowing the RCQ
to be optimized by tuning the experimental setup. Additionally, the respective
partial probability distributions can be obtained for the reactant and product
states along the observed order parameter, even when these strongly overlap.
The effects of both filtering (averaging) and uncorrelated noise are also
examined. The approach is demonstrated on numerical examples and experimental
single-molecule force probe data of the p5ab RNA hairpin and the apo-myoglobin
protein at low pH, here focusing on the case of two-state kinetics.

of the fundamental problems in distributed coordination between autonomous

for the results of [Agmon and Peleg 2006] who solve the gathering problem in

of correct robots can be achieved in the presence of multiple crash failures.
We resolve the question in this paper and show how to solve gathering, when any
number of robots may crash at any time during the algorithm, assuming strong
multiplicity detection and chirality. In contrast it is known that for the more
stronger byzantine faults, it is impossible to gather even in a 3-robot system
if one robot is faulty. Our algorithm solves the gathering of correct robots in
the semi-synchronous model where an adversary may stop any robot before
reaching its desired destination. Further the algorithm is self-stabilizing as
it achieves gathering starting from any configuration (except the bivalent
configuration where deterministic gathering is impossible).

accommodate the Higgs mass, while the quarks and leptons are required by gauge
invariance to carry non-zero charge under $U(1)_X$. This induces an irreducible
rate, $\sigma$BR, for $pp \rightarrow X \rightarrow \ell\ell$ relevant to
existing and future resonance searches, and gives rise to higher dimension
operators that are stringently constrained by precision electroweak
measurements. Combined, these bounds define a maximally allowed region in the
space of observables, ($\sigma$BR, $m_X$), outside of which is excluded by
naturalness and experimental limits. If natural supersymmetry utilizes
non-decoupling D-terms, then the associated $X$ boson can only be observed
within this window, providing a model independent `litmus test' for this broad

results only exclude regions in parameter space which were already disfavored

|V(G)|$ there exists a prime subtournament of $G$ with $|V(H)| + 1$ vertices

$C_i$ shares an edge with $C_{i+1}$ for all $1 \le i \le n-1$. Next, we

is found only in a vanishing fraction of the minimum-cost solutions at $\lambda

action, but can be affected by motion of the galaxy through the surrounding
medium. Observations of polarized radio emission of galaxies located in galaxy
clusters have revealed noticeable features of large-scale magnetic
configurations, including displacements of the magnetic structures from the
optical images and tails, which are possible imprints of ram pressure effects
arising from motion of the galaxies through the intracluster medium. We present
a quantitative dynamo model which attempts to describe the above effects. In
contrast to the traditional problem of a wind affecting a body with a
prescribed magnetic field, we investigate how a non-magnetized wind flow
affects a magnetic field that is being self-excited by galactic dynamo action.
In order to isolate the leading physical effects we exploit a simple dynamo
model that can describe relevant effects. In particular, we use what is known
as the 'no-z' approximation for the mean-field dynamo equations. In a suitable
parametric range we obtain displacements of the large-scale magnetic field, as
well as magnetic tails. However, the specific details of their locations are
quite counterintuitive. The direction of displacement is perpendicular to,
rather than parallel to, the wind direction. The point at which the tail
emerges from the galaxy depends on details of the model. The tail is eventually
directed downstream. In the simplest case the magnetic tail begins in the
region where the wind decreases the total gas velocity. Any wind that
penetrates the galaxy modifies the intrinsic dynamo action. These features are
different from those found in ram-pressure models. Any determination of
galactic motion through the cluster medium from observational data needs to
take the effects of dynamo action into account.

  Correspondence","4 pages",,"10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.131601",,"hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aging can be realized as a sub-algebra of Schr\""odinger algebra by discarding
the time-translation generator. While the 2-point functions of the Age algebra
have been known for some time, little else was known about the higher $n$-point
correlators. In this letter we present novel 3-point correlators of scalar
primary operators. We find that the Aging correlators are distinct from the
Schr\""odinger correlators by more than certain dressings with time-dependent
factors, as was the case with 2-point functions. In the existing literature,
the holographic geometry of Aging is obtained by performing certain general
coordinate transformations on the holographic dual of the Schr\""odinger theory.
Consequently, the Aging 2-point functions derived from holography look as the
Schr\""odinger 2-point functions dressed by time-dependent factors. However,
since the 3-point functions obtained in this letter are not merely dressed
Schr\""odinger correlators and instead depend on an additional time-translation
breaking variable, we conclude that the most general holographic realization of
Aging is yet to be found.

that of topological, of smooth, or of otherwise geometric
infinity-groupoids/infinity-stacks, and more generally in slices of these. It
provides a natural geometric model for structured higher nonabelian cohomology
and controls general fiber bundles in terms of associated bundles. For suitable
choices of structure infinity-group G these G-principal infinity-bundles
reproduce the theories of ordinary principal bundles, of bundle
gerbes/principal 2-bundles and of bundle 2-gerbes and generalize these to their
further higher and equivariant analogs. The induced associated infinity-bundles
subsume the notions of gerbes and higher gerbes in the literature.
  We discuss here this general theory of principal infinity-bundles, intimately
related to the axioms of Giraud, Toen-Vezzosi, Rezk and Lurie that characterize
infinity-toposes. We show a natural equivalence between principal
infinity-bundles and intrinsic nonabelian cocycles, implying the classification
of principal infinity-bundles by nonabelian sheaf hyper-cohomology. We observe
that the theory of geometric fiber infinity-bundles associated to principal
infinity-bundles subsumes a theory of infinity-gerbes and of twisted
infinity-bundles, with twists deriving from local coefficient infinity-bundles,
which we define, relate to extensions of principal infinity-bundles and show to
be classified by a corresponding notion of twisted cohomology, identified with
the cohomology of a corresponding slice infinity-topos.

homogeneous, isotropic and spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW)
cosmological model filled of a fluid of dark energy (DE) with constant equation
of state (EOS) parameter interacting with dark matter (DM). The reconstruction
method is based on expansions of the general interaction term and the relevant
cosmological variables in terms of Chebyshev polynomials which form a complete
set orthonormal functions. In this article, we reconstruct the interaction
function expanding it in terms of only the first four Chebyshev polynomials and
obtain the best estimation for the coefficients of the expansion assuming three
models: (a) a DE equation of the state parameter w=-1 (an interacting
cosmological Lambda), (b) a DE equation of the state parameter w = constant
with a dark matter density parameter fixed, (c) a DE equation of the state
parameter w = constant with a free constant dark matter density parameter to be
estimated. In all the cases, the preliminary reconstruction shows that in the
best scenario there exist the possibility of a crossing of the noninteracting
line Q=0 in the recent past within the 1-sigma and 2-sigma errors from positive
values at early times to negative values at late times. This means that, in
this reconstruction, there is an energy transfer from DE to DM at early times
and an energy transfer from DM to DE at late times. We conclude that this fact
is an indication of the possible existence of a crossing behavior in a general
interaction coupling between dark components. Finally, we conclude that in this
scenario, the observations put strong constraints on the strength of the
interaction so that its magnitude can not solve the coincidence problem or at
least alleviate significantly.

analyzing the ability to`boost' the success probability of deciding a
distributed language. The main outcome of this analysis is that the distributed
computing setting contrasts significantly with the sequential one as far as
randomization is concerned. Indeed, we prove that in some cases, the ability to
increase the success probability for deciding distributed languages is rather
limited. Informally, a (p,q)-decider for a language L is a distributed
randomized algorithm which accepts instances in L with probability at least p
and rejects instances outside of L with probability at least q. It is known
that every hereditary language that can be decided in t rounds by a
(p,q)-decider, where p^2+q>1, can actually be decided deterministically in O(t)
rounds. In one of our results we give evidence supporting the conjecture that
the above statement holds for all distributed languages. This is achieved by
considering the restricted case of path topologies. We then turn our attention
to the range below the aforementioned threshold, namely, the case where
p^2+q\leq1. We define B_k(t) to be the set of all languages decidable in at
most t rounds by a (p,q)-decider, where p^{1+1/k}+q>1. It is easy to see that
every language is decidable (in zero rounds) by a (p,q)-decider satisfying
p+q=1. Hence, the hierarchy B_k provides a spectrum of complexity classes
between determinism and complete randomization. We prove that all these classes
are separated: for every integer k\geq 1, there exists a language L satisfying
L\in B_{k+1}(0) but L\notin B_k(t) for any t=o(n). In addition, we show that
B_\infty(t) does not contain all languages, for any t=o(n). Finally, we show
that if the inputs can be restricted in certain ways, then the ability to boost
the success probability becomes almost null.

produce all conformal dimensions $\Delta_{r,s}^{p,p'}<{(p'-p)(9p-p')\over

at 3 and 7 mm, and determined the spectral slopes, dust opacity indices and
dust disc masses. We also present temporal monitoring results of a small
sub-set of sources at 7, 15 mm and 3+6 cm to investigate grain growth to cm
sizes and constrain emission mechanisms in these sources. Additionally, we
investigated the potential correlation between grain growth signatures in the
infrared (10 \mu m silicate feature) and millimetre (1-3 mm spectral slope,
{\alpha}). Eleven sources at 3 and 7 mm have dominant thermal dust emission up
to 7 mm, with 7 of these having a 1-3 mm dust opacity index less than unity,
suggesting grain growth up to at least mm sizes. The Chamaeleon sources
observed at 15 mm and beyond show the presence of excess emission from an
ionised wind and/or chromo- spheric emission. Long-timescale monitoring at 7 mm
indicated that cm-sized pebbles are present in at least four sources.
Short-timescale monitoring at 15 mm suggests the excess emission is from
thermal free-free emission. Finally, a weak correlation was found between the
strength of the 10 \mum feature and {\alpha}, suggesting simultaneous dust
evolution of the inner and outer parts of the disc. This survey shows that
grain growth up to cm-sized pebbles and the presence of excess emission at 15
mm and beyond are common in these systems, and that temporal monitoring is
required to disentangle these emission mechanisms.

framework to analyze the frequency, phase and amplitude of oscillatory protein
concentrations in gene regulatory networks with negative cyclic feedback. We
first formulate the analysis framework of oscillation profiles based on
multivariable harmonic balance. With this framework, the frequency, phase and
amplitude are obtained analytically in terms of kinetic constants of the
reactions despite the nonlinearity of the dynamics. These results are
demonstrated with the Pentilator and Hes7 self-repression network, and it is
shown that the developed analysis method indeed predicts the profiles of the
oscillations. A distinctive feature of the presented result is that the
waveform of oscillations is analytically obtained for a broad class of
biochemical systems. Thus, it is easy to see how the waveform is determined
from the system's parameters and structures. We present general biological
insights that are applicable for any gene regulatory networks with negative

properties are studied. Through the characteristic matrices, three important
types of covering approximation operators are concisely equivalently

another one and its transpose. And we develop an algorithm for this boolean

perturbation theory which is powerful in practice to employ various fundamental
gauge conditions easily depending on the character of the problem. The
perturbation equations are presented without fixing the temporal gauge
condition and are arranged so that one can easily impose fundamental gauge
conditions by simply setting one of the perturbation variables in the equations
equal to zero. In this way one can use the gauge degrees of freedom as an
advantage in handling problems. Except for the synchronous gauge condition, all
the other fundamental gauge conditions completely fix the gauge mode, and
consequently, each variable in such a gauge has a unique gauge invariant
counterpart, so that we can identify the variable as the gauge-invariant one.
Here, we extend Bardeen's linear formulation to fully nonlinear order in
perturbations, with the gauge advantage kept intact. Derived equations are
exact, and from these we can easily expand to higher order perturbations in a
gauge-ready form. We consider scalar- and vector-type perturbations of an ideal
fluid in a flat background; we also present the multiple components of ideal
fluid case. As applications we present fully nonlinear density and velocity

negative and the goal is to learn a scoring function that minimizes the
probability of mis-ranking a pair of positive and negative instances (or
equivalently, that maximizes the area under the ROC curve), has been widely
studied in recent years. A dominant theoretical and algorithmic framework for
the problem has been to reduce bipartite ranking to pairwise classification; in
particular, it is well known that the bipartite ranking regret can be
formulated as a pairwise classification regret, which in turn can be upper
bounded using usual regret bounds for classification problems. Recently,
Kotlowski et al. (2011) showed regret bounds for bipartite ranking in terms of
the regret associated with balanced versions of the standard (non-pairwise)
logistic and exponential losses. In this paper, we show that such
(non-pairwise) surrogate regret bounds for bipartite ranking can be obtained in
terms of a broad class of proper (composite) losses that we term as strongly
proper. Our proof technique is much simpler than that of Kotlowski et al.
(2011), and relies on properties of proper (composite) losses as elucidated
recently by Reid and Williamson (2010, 2011) and others. Our result yields
explicit surrogate bounds (with no hidden balancing terms) in terms of a
variety of strongly proper losses, including for example logistic, exponential,
squared and squared hinge losses as special cases. We also obtain tighter
surrogate bounds under certain low-noise conditions via a recent result of
Clemencon and Robbiano (2011).

superconductors of a possible extended $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry. We
consider the case of a dominant $s_\pm$ gap blended by a secondary extended $s$
component in which gap nodes can develop in the Fermi pockets near zone corner
and/or boundary. Due to the strong nesting effect associated with nodal
regions, dynamical spin and charge susceptibilities can exhibit strong peaks at
momenta near $(\pm\pi/2,0)$, $(\pm\pi,\pm\pi/2)$, as well as $(\pm\pi,0)$ in
the unfolded Brillouin zone. For PCARS, considering an anisotropic band effect
induced by an applied voltage, [100] differential conductance can exhibit a
$V$-shape behavior manifesting a gap node occurring in such direction. It is
highly suggested that the above features can be experimentally investigated to
help sorting out the pairing symmetry of iron-based superconductors.

analysis of these effects on the MI by considering a linear-birefringence TCF

analysis focuses on the MI of the asymmetric CW states in the TCFs, which have
no counterparts in single-core fibers. We find that, the asymmetric CW state
exists when its total power exceeds a threshold (minimum) value, which is
sensitive to the value of the XPM coefficient. We consider, in particular, a
class of asymmetric CW states that admit analytical solutions. In the anomalous
dispersion regime, without taking the PMD and PDC into account, the MI gain
spectra of the birefringent TCF, if scaled by the threshold power, are almost
identical to those of the zero-birefringence TCF. However, in the normal
dispersion regime, the power-scaled MI gain spectra of the birefringent TCFs
are distinctly different from their zero-birefringence counterparts, and the
difference is particularly significant for the circular-birefringence TCF,
which takes a larger XPM coefficient. On the other hand, the PMD and PDC only
exert weak effects on the MI gain spectra. We also simulate the nonlinear
evolution of the MI of the CW inputs in the TCFs and obtain a good agreement

between SNPs and a carbon isotope discrimination phenotype that were previously
reported using a family based method, and discover an additional SNP associated

as aeronautics, automotive and domestic appliances. Several variations of their
curvatures and orientations generate difficulties during their manufacturing or
the machining of dies used in moulding, injection and forging. Analysis of
several parts highlights two levels of difficulties between three types of
shapes: prismatic parts with simple geometrical shapes, aeronautic structure
parts composed of several shallow pockets and forging dies composed of several
deep cavities which often contain protrusions. This paper mainly concerns High
Speed Machining (HSM) of these dies which represent the highest complexity
level because of the shapes' geometry and their topology. Five axes HSM is
generally required for such complex shaped parts but 3 axes machining can be
sufficient for dies. Evolutions in HSM CAM software and machine tools lead to
an important increase in time for machining preparation. Analysis stages of the
CAD model particularly induce this time increase which is required for a wise
choice of cutting tools and machining strategies. Assistance modules for
prismatic parts machining features identification in CAD models are widely
implemented in CAM software. In spite of the last CAM evolutions, these kinds
of CAM modules are undeveloped for aeronautical structure parts and forging
dies. Development of new CAM modules for the extraction of relevant machining
areas as well as the definition of the topological relations between these
areas must make it possible for the machining assistant to reduce the machining
preparation time. In this paper, a model developed for the description of
complex shape parts topology is presented. It is based on machining areas
extracted for the construction of geometrical features starting from CAD models
of the parts. As topology is described in order to assist machining assistant
during machining process generation, the difficulties associated with tasks he
carried out are analyzed at first. The topological model presented after is
based on the basic geometrical features extracted. Topological relations which
represent the framework of the model are defined between the basic geometrical
features which are gathered afterwards in macro-features. Approach used for the
identification of these macro-features is also presented in this paper.
Detailed application on the construction of the topological model of forging
dies is presented in the last part of the paper.

problem, shows that the globule behaves essentially differently in two modes of
extension. In the force-clamp mode, mechanical unfolding of the globule with
increasing applied force occurs without intramolecular microphase segregation,
and at certain threshold value of the pulling force the globule unfolds as a
whole (""all-or-none"" transition). The value of the threshold force and the
corresponding jump in the distance between the chain ends increase with a
deterioration of the solvent quality and/or with an increase in the degree of
polymerization. In the position-clamp mode, the globule unfolding occurs via
intramolecular microphase coexistence of globular and extended microphases
followed by an abrupt unraveling transition. Reaction force in the microphase
segregation regime demonstrates an ""anomalous"" decrease with increasing
extension. Comparison of deformation curves in force and position-clamp modes
demonstrates that at weak and strong extensions the curves for two modes
coincide, differences are observed in the intermediate extension range. Another
unfolding scenario is typical for short globules: in both modes of extension
they unfold continuously, without jumps or intramolecular microphase
coexistence, by passing a sequence of uniformly elongated configurations.

gap or hole created by a secondary black hole embedded in the disk. We find
that for an interesting range of parameters of black hole masses (~10^6 to 10^9
solar masses), orbital separation (~1 AU to ~0.1 pc), and gap width (10 to 190
disk scale heights), the missing thermal emission from a gap manifests itself
in an observable decrement in the spectral energy distribution. We present
observational diagnostics in terms of power-law forms that can be fit to
line-free regions in AGN spectra or in fluxes from sequences of broad filters.
Most interestingly, the change in slope in the broken power-law is almost
entirely dependent on the width of gap in the accretion disk, which in turn is
uniquely determined by mass ratio of the black holes, such that it scales
roughly as q^(5/12). Thus one can use spectral observations of the continuum of
bright active galactic nuclei to infer not only the presence of a closely
separated black hole binary but also the mass ratio. When the black hole merger
opens an entire hole (or cavity) in the inner disk, the broad band SED of the
AGN or quasar may serve as a diagnostic. Such sources should be especially
luminous in optical bands but intrinsically faint in X-rays (i.e., not merely
obscured). We briefly note that viable candidates may have already been

derive explicit analytic expressions for the population averaged cross
correlation functions. Our theory explains why the intuitive mean field
description fails, how the echo of single action potentials causes an apparent
lag of inhibition with respect to excitation, and how the size of the network
can be scaled while maintaining its dynamical state. Finally, we derive a new
criterion for the emergence of collective oscillations from the spectrum of the
time-evolution propagator.

the performance of tries under a realistic probabilistic model is of

rarely analyzed (with a few notable exceptions) under more realistic models of

demonstrated that in the absence of an external polarizer, carriers in a magnet

due to the relativistic spin-orbit coupling, resulting in a current induced
spin-orbit torque (SOT) acting on the magnetization. In this paper we report

we detect excitations of magnetization of a ferromagnetic semiconductor

derived spectroscopically by line-profile fits to high-resolution and high-S/N
spectra obtained at various observatories. Ionization equilibria of multiple
metals and the Stark-broadened H and the neutral He lines constitute our
primary indicators for the parameter determination, supplemented by
(spectro-)photometry. Data on Teff, logg, helium abundances, microturbulence,
macroturbulence and rotational velocities are presented. The interstellar
reddening and the ratio of total-to-selective extinction towards the stars are
determined. Our empirical spectral-type-Teff scale is steeper than reference
relations, the stars are significantly bluer, and bolometric corrections differ
significantly from established literature values. Photometric
Teff-determinations based on the reddening-free Q-index are found to be of
limited use for studies of BA-type supergiants because of large errors of
typically +-5%+-3% (1sigma statistical, 1sigma systematic), compared to a
spectroscopically achieved precision of 1-2%. The reddening-free [c_1]-index
and beta on the other hand are found to provide useful starting values for
further analyses, with uncertainties of +-1%+-2.5% in Teff, and +-0.04+-0.13dex

of fluctuating fields are accurately described by a simple random matrix model.
During the approach to the inflection point, bending trajectories and
violations of slow roll are commonplace, and 'many-field' effects, in which
three or more fields influence the perturbations, are often important. However,
in a large fraction of models consistent with constraints on the tilt the
signatures of multifield evolution occur on unobservably large scales. Our
scenario is a concrete microphysical realization of quasi-single-field
inflation, with scalar masses of order $H$, but the cubic and quartic couplings
are typically too small to produce detectable non-Gaussianity. We argue that
our results are characteristic of a broader class of models arising from
multifield potentials that are natural in the Wilsonian sense.

oxide (Cu2O) at ultra low temperatures when excitons are confined within a

processes, we have included in this paper deformation potential phonon
scattering, radiative and non-radiative decay and Auger decay. The relaxation
kinetics has been analysed for temperatures in the range between 0.3K and 5K.
Under the action of deformation potential phonon scattering only, we find for
temperatures above 0.5K that the excitons reach local equilibrium with the
lattice i.e. that the effective local temperature is coming down to bath
temperature, while below 0.5K a non-thermal energy distribution remains.
Interestingly, for all temperatures the global spatial distribution of excitons
does not reach the equilibrium distribution, but stays at a much higher
effective temperature. If we include further a finite lifetime of the excitons
and the two-particle Auger decay, we find that both the local and the global
effective temperature are not coming down to bath temperature. In the first
case we find a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) to occur for all temperatures
in the investigated range. Comparing our results with the thermal equilibrium
case, we find that BEC occurs for a significantly higher number of excitons in
the trap. This effect could be related to the higher global temperature, which
requires an increased number of excitons within the trap to observe the BEC. In
case of Auger decay, we do not find at any temperature a BEC due to the heating
of the exciton gas.

dominant frequencies for individual mode numbers m, and to extract the modal
structure of the full non-linear flow. The maps of the energy of the

that fluctuations originate in the outer boundary layer. The threshold of

secondary non-axisymmetric instability of a centripetal jet forming at the

Particles (ALPs), very light spin-zero bosons with a two-photon coupling. ALPs
can give rise to observable effects in very-high-energy astrophysics. Above
roughly 100 GeV the horizon of the observable Universe progressively shrinks as
the energy increases, due to scattering of beam photons off background photons
in the optical and infrared bands, which produces e+e- pairs. In the presence
of large-scale magnetic fields photons emitted by a blazar can oscillate into
ALPs on the way to us and back into photons before reaching the Earth. Since
ALPs do not interact with background photons, the effective mean free path of
beam photons increases, enhancing the photon survival probability. While the
absorption probability increases with energy, photon-ALP oscillations are
energy-independent, and so the survival probability increases with energy
compared to standard expectations. We have performed a systematic analysis of
this effect, interpreting the present data on very-high-energy photons from
blazars. Our predictions can be tested with presently operating Cherenkov
Telescopes like H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS and CANGAROO III as well as with
detectors like ARGO-YBJ and MILAGRO and with the planned Cherenkov Telescope
Array and the HAWC-ray observatory. ALPs with the right properties to produce
the above effects can possibly be discovered by the GammeV experiment at

arising from gluon-gluon fusion to the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic dipole
moments (CEDM and CMDM) as well as the total and differential $t\bar{t}$ cross
sections at the LHC and Tevatron. The sensitivity of measured charged asymmetry
at the LHC to CEDM and CMDM is also studied. We find that at the Tevatron and
the LHC, non-zero values of CMDM could suppress the $t\bar{t}$ production rate.
It is shown that the ratio of $\sigma(gg\rightarrow
t\bar{t})/\sigma(p\bar{p}\rightarrow t\bar{t})$ at the Tevatron is more
sensitive to CEDM and CMDM than the LHC case. The presence of CEDM always
increases the contribution of gluon-gluon fusion process in top pair rate at
the Tevatron and LHC. Except for a small range of CMDM, the presence of CEDM
and CMDM can increase the fraction of gluon-gluon fusion at the Tevatron and
LHC. The measured ratio of $\sigma(gg\rightarrow
t\bar{t})/\sigma(p\bar{p}\rightarrow t\bar{t})$ at the Tevatron is used to
derive bounds on the chromoelectric and chromomagnetic dipole moments as well
as the total and differential ($d\sigma/dm_{t\bar{t}}$) cross sections at the
LHC and Tevatron, and the measured charged asymmetry at the LHC. The
combination of $d\sigma_{TeV}/dm_{t\bar{t}}$ and $\sigma_{LHC}$ provides
stringent limits on CMDM and CEDM.

formation in a sample of zoom-in cosmological simulations. Our simulation
sample focuses on galaxies with present-day stellar masses in the 10^10-10^11
Msun range, in field and loose group environments, with a broad variety of mass
growth histories. In our models, bars are almost absent from the progenitors of
present-day spirals at z>1.5, and they remain rare and generally too weak to be
observable down to z~1. After this characteristic epoch, the fractions of
observable and strong bars raise rapidly, bars being present in 80% of spiral
galaxies and easily observable in two thirds of these at z<0.5. This is
quantitatively consistent with the redshift evolution of the observed bar
fraction. Our models predict that the decrease in the bar fraction with
increasing redshift should continue with a fraction of observable bars <10-15%
in disk galaxies at z>1. Our models also predict later bar formation in
lower-mass galaxies, in agreement with existing data. We find that the
characteristic epoch of bar formation, namely redshift z~0.8-1, corresponds to
the epoch at which today's spirals acquire their disk-dominated morphology. At
higher redshift, disks tend to be rapidly destroyed by mergers and
gravitational instabilities and rarely develop significant bars. The bar
formation epoch corresponds to the transition between an early ""violent"" phase
of spiral galaxy formation at z>1 and a late ""secular"" phase at z<0.8. In the
secular phase, the presence of bars substantially contributes to the growth of
the bulge, but the bulge mass budget remains statistically dominated by the
contribution of mergers, interactions and disk instabilities at high redshift.
Early bars at z>1 are often short-lived, while most of the bars formed at z<1
persist down to z=0, late cosmological gas infall being necessary to maintain
some of them.

space for common triplets, and hence, has a very low memory requirement.
INSTRUCT efficiently handles prefix and suffix search queries in addition to
the exact string search operation by iteratively checking the presence of
triplets. We also propose an extension of the structure to handle substring
search efficiently, albeit with an increase in the space requirements. This
extension is important in the context of trie-based solutions which are unable
to handle such queries efficiently. We perform several experiments portraying
that INSTRUCT outperforms the existing structures by nearly a factor of two in
terms of space requirements, while the query times are better. The ability to
handle insertion and deletion of strings in addition to supporting all kinds of
queries including exact search, prefix/suffix search and substring search makes
INSTRUCT a complete data structure.

Motivated by the random access method employed in LTE, we propose a novel
approach that is able to sustain a wide random access load range, while
preserving the physical layer unchanged and incurring minor changes in the
medium access control layer. The proposed scheme increases the amount of
available contention resources, without resorting to the increase of system
resources, such as contention sub-frames and preambles. This increase is
accomplished by expanding the contention space to the code domain, through the
creation of random access codewords. Specifically, in the proposed scheme,
users perform random access by transmitting one or none of the available LTE
orthogonal preambles in multiple random access sub-frames, thus creating access
codewords that are used for contention. In this way, for the same number of
random access sub-frames and orthogonal preambles, the amount of available
contention resources is drastically increased, enabling the support of an
increased number of MTC users. We present the framework and analysis of the
proposed code-expanded random access method and show that our approach supports
load regions that are beyond the reach of current systems.

This gradient likely originates from non-axisymmetric perturbations of the

Here, we apply the traditional density wave theory and analytically model the
radial component of the two-dimensional velocity field. Provided that the
radial velocity gradient is caused by relatively long-lived spiral arms that
can affect stars substantially above the plane, this analytic model provides
new independent estimates for the parameters of the Milky Way spiral structure.

  In contrast to this simple algorithm, evolutionary algorithms used in
practice usually employ refined recombination strategies in order to avoid the
creation of infeasible offspring. We study extensions of the basic algorithm by
two such concepts which are central in recombination, namely \emph{repair
mechanisms} and \emph{parent selection}. We show that repairing infeasible
offspring leads to an improved expected optimization time of
$\mathord{O}(n^{3.2}(\log n)^{0.2})$. As a second part of our study we prove
that choosing parents that guarantee feasible offspring results in an even
better optimization time of $\mathord{O}(n^{3}\log n)$.

operator can asymptotically improve the runtime of evolutionary algorithms.

depletion of pre-main sequence (PMS) solar-type stars. Methods: The impact of
rotational mixing and of the hydrostatic effects of rotation on lithium
abundances are investigated by computing non-rotating and rotating PMS models
that include a comprehensive treatment of shellular rotation. The influence of
the disc lifetime is then studied by comparing the lithium content of PMS
rotating models experiencing different durations of the disc-locking phase
between 3 and 9 Myr. Results: The surface lithium abundance at the end of the
PMS is decreased when rotational effects are included. During the beginning of
the lithium depletion phase, only hydrostatic effects of rotation are at work.
This results in a decrease in the lithium depletion rate for rotating models
compared to non-rotating ones. When the convective envelope recedes from the
stellar centre, rotational mixing begins to play an important role due to
differential rotation near the bottom of the convective envelope. This mixing
results in a decrease in the surface lithium abundance with a limited
contribution from hydrostatic effects of rotation, which favours lithium
depletion during the second part of the PMS evolution. The impact of rotation
on PMS lithium depletion is also found to be sensitive to the duration of the
disc-locking phase. When the disc lifetime increases, the PMS lithium abundance
of a solar-type star decreases owing to the higher efficiency of rotational
mixing in the radiative zone. A relationship between the surface rotation and
lithium abundance at the end of the PMS is then obtained: slow rotators on the
zero-age main sequence are predicted to be more lithium-depleted than fast
rotators due to the increase in the disc lifetime.

exactly reversed if the two temperatures are exchanged. Introducing partial

equilibrium Casimir force. The method is illustrated by (re)deriving the heat
radiation of a plate, a sphere and a cylinder. We analyze the radiation of a
sphere for different materials, emphasizing that a simplification often
employed for metallic nano-spheres is typically invalid. We derive asymptotic
formulae for heat transfer and non-equilibrium interactions for the cases of a
sphere in front a plate and for two spheres, extending previous results. As an
example, we show that a hot nano-sphere can levitate above a plate with the
repulsive non-equilibrium force overcoming gravity -- an effect that is not due

occupancy of $d$ levels remains always finite just as in the one-dimensional
Hubbard model. Exact diagonalization on finite chains gives the same result for
finite $U_f$, while the Gutzwiller method leads to a Brinkman-Rice transition
at a critical value ($U_d^c$), which depends on $U_f$ and $V$.

that the stationary distribution at non-bottleneck queues converges weakly to
the stationary distribution of an ergodic, open product-form queueing network.
This open network is obtained by replacing bottleneck queues with per-route
Poissonian sources whose rates are determined by the solution of a strictly
concave optimization problem. Then, we focus on the transient behavior of the
network and use fluid limits to prove that the amount of fluid, or customers,
on each route eventually concentrates on the bottleneck queues only, and that
the long-term proportions of fluid in each route and in each queue solve the
dual of the concave optimization problem that determines the throughputs of the
previous open network.

of physically spurious eigenvalues which are either huge or close to zero

polynomial transformations with a polynomial inverse. The main concern is
whether their restriction to the real locus reflects all the richness of the
complex dynamics. This question is declined in two directions: the topological
entropy and the Fatou set.
  For the first one, we introduce a purely geometric quantity depending only on
the surface, and we call it concordance. Then we show that the ratio of real
and complex entropies is linked to this quantity. The concordance is
explicitely computed for many examples of surfaces, especially abelian surfaces
which are broadly studied, as well as some K3 surfaces.
  In the second part, we are interested in the Fatou set, which corresponds to
complex points for which the dynamics is simple. Thanks to previous results of
Dinh and Sibony about closed positive currents, we prove that this set is
hyperbolic in the sense of Kobayashi, after possibly deleting some curves which
are fixed by (an iterate of) our transformation. From this property we deduce
that, except for some exceptional cases in which the topology of the real locus
is simple and the dynamics well understood, this real locus cannot be entirely
contained in the Fatou set. Thus the complexity of the dynamics is observable
on real points in most cases.

efficiently found by solving a binary optimization problem, even for large
networks. In order to validate our procedure, we compare its results with
numerical simulations on a realistic network describing the European
interconnected high-voltage electricity system, finding a very good agreement.
Our synchronization threshold can be used to test the stability of frequency
synchronization to link removals. As the threshold value changes only in very
few cases when aplied to the European realistic network, we conclude that
network is resilient in this regard. Since the threshold calculation depends on
the local connectivity, it can also be used to identify critical network
partitions acting as synchronization bottlenecks. In our stability experiments
we observe that when a link removal triggers a change in the critical
partition, its limits tend to converge to national borders. This phenomenon,
which can have important consequences to synchronization dynamics in case of
cascading failure, signals the influence of the uncomplete topological
integration of national power grids at the European scale.

noncommutativity. In this work, we gain further insight in the physical aspects
of the spin noncommutativity. The noncommutative Dirac equation is derived from
an action principle, and it is found to lead to the conservation of a modified

the Landau problem in the presence of spin noncommutativity. For this scenario
of a constant magnetic field, we are able to derive a simple Hermitean
non-commutative correction to the Hamiltonian operator, and show that the
degeneracy of the excited states is lifted by the noncommutativity at the
second order or perturbation theory.

neglecting quantum interference between the two upper J-levels of each line.
Here we relax both approximations and show that the joint action of partial
frequency redistribution (PRD) and J-state interference produces much more
complex fractional linear polarization (Q/I) profiles, with large amplitudes in
their wings. Such wing polarization signals turn out to be very sensitive to
the temperature structure of the atmospheric model, so that they can be

next-to-lightest composite state is the techni-rho meson, with a mass larger

dilaton to two photons and to two (real or virtual) Z and W bosons. For generic
choices of the parameters, we find a suppression of the decay into heavy gauge
bosons, in respect to the analog decay of the standard-model Higgs. We find a
dramatic effect on the decay into photons, which can be both strongly
suppressed or strongly enhanced, the latter case corresponding to the large-N
regime of the dual theory. There is a correlation between this decay rate of
the dilaton into photons and the mass splitting between the techni-rho meson

mass, otherwise their separation in mass is comparable to the mass scale

put on crystals modify drastically hadron properties in dense medium and affect
strongly the nuclear tensor forces, thereby influencing the equation of state
(EoS) of dense nuclear and asymmetric nuclear matter. The matter comprised of
half skyrmions has vanishing quark condensate but non-vanishing pion decay
constant and could be interpreted as a hadronic dual of strong-coupled quark
matter. We infer from this observation combined with certain predictions of
hidden local symmetry in low-energy hadronic interactionsa a set of new scaling
laws -- called ""new-BR"" -- for the parameters in nuclear effective field theory
controlled by renormalization-group flow. They are subjected to the EoS of
symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter, and are then applied to nuclear
symmetry energies and properties of compact stars. The changeover from the
skyrmion matter to a half-skyrmion matter that takes place after the cross-over
density $n_{1/2}$ provides a simple and natural field theoretic explanation for
the change of the EoS from soft to stiff at a density above that of nuclear
matter required for compact stars as massive as $\sim 2.4M_\odot$. Cross-over
density in the range $1.5n_0 \lsim n_{1/2} \lsim 2.0 n_0$ has been employed,
and the possible skyrmion half-skyrmion coexistence {or cross-over} near
$n_{1/2}$ is discussed. The novel structure of {the tensor forces and} the EoS
obtained with the new-BR scaling is relevant for neutron-rich nuclei and
compact star matter and could be studied in RIB (rare isotope beam) machines.

intersubband transmission channels gives rise to spin-dependent Fano resonance
effect. The spin-dependent Fano resonance is sensitively dependent on the
helicity of the spiral. By tuning the CCH potential well depth and the incident
energy, this provides a potential way to detect the spin structure in the CCH.

quantum field methods into the quantum mechanics. This had tragic consequences
because it produced crippled model Hamiltonians, unfortunately considered
sufficient for a description of solids including superconductors. From there,
of course, Fr\""ohlich derived wrong effective Hamiltonian, from which incorrect
BCS theory arose.
  1) Mechanical and field patterns cannot be mixed. Instead of field methods
applied to the mechanical Born-Oppenheimer approximation we have entirely to
avoid it and construct an independent and standalone field pattern. This leads
to a new form of the Bohr's complementarity on the level of composite systems.
  2) We have correctly to deal with the center of gravity, which is under the
field pattern ""materialized"" in the form of new quasipartiles - rotons and
translons. This leads to a new type of relativity of internal and external
degrees of freedom and one-particle way of bypassing degeneracies (gap
formation).
  3) The possible symmetry cannot be apriori loaded but has to be aposteriori
obtained as a solution of field equations, formulated in a general form without
translational or any other symmetry. This leads to an utterly revised view of
symmetry breaking in non-adiabatic systems, namely Jahn-Teller effect and
superconductivity. These two phenomena are synonyms and share a unique symmetry
breaking.

Equivalence Principle (SEP) induces on the orbital motion of a binary system
constituted of self-gravitating bodies immersed in a constant and uniform
external field. We do not restrict to the small eccentricity limit. Moreover,
we do not select any specific spatial orientation of the external polarizing
field. We explicitly calculate the SEP-induced mean rates of change of all the
osculating Keplerian orbital elements of the binary, the perturbation of the
projection of the binary orbit onto the line-of-sight, the shift of the radial
velocity, and the range and range-rate signatures and as well. We find that the
ratio of the SEP precessions of the node and the inclination of the binary
depends only on and the pericenter of the binary itself, being independent on
both the magnitude and the orientation of the polarizing field, and on the
semimajor axis, the eccentricity and the node of the binary. Our results, which
do not depend on any particular SEP-violating theoretical scheme, can be
applied to quite general astronomical and astrophysical scenarios. They can be
used to better interpret present and future SEP experiments, especially when
several theoretical SEP mechanisms may be involved, and to suitably design new
dedicated tests.

could indicate possible new physics driving the growth of density fluctuations
in the early Universe. These include an unusually low power at the largest
scales and an apparent alignment of the quadrupole and octopole moments. In
LCDM, the quadrupole and octopole moments should be statistically independent.
These low probability features may simply be due to posterior selections from
many such possible effects. If this is not the case, however, their combined
statistical significance would be equal to the product of their individual
significances. Ignoring the biasing due to posterior selection, the missing
large-angle correlations would have a probability as low as ~0.1% and the low-l
multipole alignment would be unlikely at the ~4.9% level; under the least
favourable conditions, their simultaneous observation in the context of the
standard model could then be likely at only the ~0.005% level. In this paper,
we explore the possibility that these features are indeed anomalous, and show
that the corresponding probability of CMB multipole alignment in the R_h=ct
Universe would then be ~7-10%, depending on the number of large-scale
Sachs-Wolfe induced fluctuations. Since the low power at the largest spatial
scales is reproduced in this cosmology without the need to invoke cosmic
variance, the overall likelihood of observing both of these features in the CMB
is > 7%, much more likely than in LCDM. The key physical ingredient responsible
for this difference is the existence in the former of a maximum fluctuation
size at the time of recombination, which is absent in the latter because of
inflation.

cracks at the foundation. A variety of engineering solutions were recommended
to improve the soil strength and thus prevent such occurrences in future.
