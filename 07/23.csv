deformation chains is introduced and explored in detail. The procedure outlines
a set of rules for analytically constructing constraint equations that involve
the finite localized energy of cyclically generated defects. The idea of
obtaining cyclically deformed defects concerns the possibility of regenerating
a primitive (departing) defect structure through successive, unidirectional,
and eventually irreversible, deformation processes. Our technique is applied on
kink-like and lump-like solutions in models described by a single real scalar
field, such that extensions to quantum mechanics follow the usual theory of
deformed defects. The preliminary results show that the cyclic device supports
simultaneously kink-like and lump-like defects into 3- and 4-cyclic deformation
chains with topological mass values closed by trigonometric and hyperbolic
deformations. In a straightforward generalization, results concerning with the
analytical calculation of $N$-cyclic deformations are obtained and lessons
regarding extensions from more elaborated primitive defects are depicted.

stars and planets with orbital periods less than 200 days and with radii
between 1.5 and 30 Earth radii, and was based on Kepler planet candidates
detected during Quarters 1 through 6. We created models of planetary systems
with different distributions of planet multiplicity and inclinations, simulated
observations of these systems by Kepler, and compared the properties of the
transits of detectable objects to actual Kepler planet detections.
Specifically, we compared with both the Kepler sample's transit numbers and
normalized transit duration ratios in order to determine each model's
goodness-of-fit. We did not include any constraints from radial velocity
surveys. Based on our best-fit models, 75-80% of planetary systems have 1 or 2
planets with orbital periods less than 200 days. In addition, over 85% of
planets have orbital inclinations less than 3 degrees (relative to a common
reference plane). This high degree of coplanarity is comparable to that seen in
our Solar System. These results have implications for planet formation and
evolution theories. Low inclinations are consistent with planets forming in a
protoplanetary disk, followed by evolution without significant and lasting
perturbations from other bodies capable of increasing inclinations.

information measures, which commonly use Shannon's entropy function for each
selected stationary states of the process. The hidden information is important
for evaluation of missing connections, disclosing the process' meaningful
information, which enables producing logic of the information. The presentation
consists of three Parts. In Part 1R-revised we analyze mechanism of arising
information regularities from a stochastic process, measured by EF,
independently of the process' specific source and origin. Uncovering the
process' regularities leads us to an information law, based on extracting
maximal information from its minimum, which could create these regularities.
The solved variation problem (VP) determines a dynamic process, measured by
information path functional (IPF), and information dynamic model, approximating
the EF measured stochastic process with a maximal functional probability on
trajectories. In Part 2, we study the cooperative processes, arising at the
consolidation, as a result of the VP-EF-IPF approach, which is able to produce
multiple cooperative structures, concurrently assembling in hierarchical

3 we study the evolutionary information processes and regularities of evolution
dynamics, evaluated by the entropy functional (EF) of random field and
informational path functional of a dynamic space-time process. The information

rich Abell clusters at $z \lesssim$ 0.1: A119, A2670, A3330 and A389. Deep
images in u', g', r' and medium-resolution galaxy spectra were taken using
MOSAIC 2 CCD and Hydra MOS mounted on a Blanco 4-m telescope at CTIO.
Post-merger features are identified by visual inspection based on asymmetric
disturbed features, faint structures, discontinuous halo structures, rings and
dust lanes. We found that ~ 25% of bright (M_r < -20) cluster red-sequence
galaxies show post-merger signatures in four clusters consistently. Most (~
71%) of the featured galaxies were found to be bulge-dominated, and for the
subsample of bulge-dominated red-sequence galaxies, the post-merger fraction
rises to ~ 38%. We also found that roughly 4% of bulge-dominated red-sequence
galaxies interact (on-going merger). A total of 42% (38% post-merger, 4%
on-going merger) of galaxies show merger-related features. Compared to a field
galaxy study with a similar limiting magnitude (van Dokkum 2005), our cluster
study presents a similar post-merger fraction but a markedly lower on-going
merger fraction. The merger fraction derived is surprisingly high for the high
density of our clusters, where the fast internal motions of galaxies are
thought to play a negative role in galaxy mergers. The fraction of post-merger
and on-going merger galaxies can be explained as follows. Most of the
post-merger galaxies may have carried over their merger features from their
previous halo environment, whereas interacting galaxies interact in the current
cluster in situ. According to our semi-analytic calculation, massive cluster
haloes may very well have experienced tens of halo mergers over the last 4-5
Gyr; post-merger features last that long, allowing these features to be
detected in our clusters today. (Abridged)

transactions in the Electronic Market for Interbank Deposits (e-Mid) to
investigate on two main issues. First, we characterize the division of roles
between borrowers and lenders in long-run relations by providing evidence on
network formation at a yearly frequency. Second, we identify the 'key players'
in the marketplace and study their behaviour. Key players are 'locally-central
banks' within a network that lend (or borrow) large volumes to (from) several
counterparties, while borrowing (or lending) small volumes from (to) a small
number of institutions. Our results are twofold. We show that the aggregate
trading patterns in e-Mid are characterized by largely asymmetric relations.
This implies a clear division of roles between lenders and borrowers. Second,
the key players do not exploit their position of network leaders by imposing
opportunistic pricing policies. We find that only a fraction of the networks
composed by big players are characterized by interest rates that are
statistically different from the average market rate throughout the turmoil

attention in various disciplines. Most of previous works in this area mainly
focus on discussing the effects of spreading probability or immunization
strategy on static networks. However, in real systems, the peer-to-peer network
structure changes constantly according to frequently social activities of
users. In order to capture this dynamical property and study its impact on
information spreading, in this paper, a link rewiring strategy based on the
Fermi function is introduced. In the present model, the informed individuals
tend to break old links and reconnect to their second-order friends with more
uninformed neighbors. Simulation results on the susceptible-infected-recovered
(\textit{SIR}) model with fixed recovery time $T=1$ indicate that the
information would spread more faster and broader with the proposed rewiring
strategy. Extensive analyses of the information cascade size distribution show
that the spreading process of the initial steps plays a very important role,
that is to say, the information will spread out if it is still survival at the
beginning time. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth
understanding of information spreading on dynamical social networks.

$\omega_I(n;\mu>\mu_c)=2\pi T_{BH}(n+{1\over 2})$. This implies that for
perturbations modes in the interval $\mu_c<\mu\leq 1$, the relaxation period
$\tau\sim 1/\omega_I$ of the black hole becomes extremely long as the extremal
limit $T_{BH}\to 0$ is approached. A generalization of the results to the case
of scalar quasinormal resonances of near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes is
also provided. In particular, we prove that only black holes that rotate fast
enough (with $M\Omega\geq {2\over 5}$, where $M$ and $\Omega$ are the
black-hole mass and angular velocity, respectively) possess this family of
remarkably long-lived perturbation modes.

recessive disease alleles, and this phenomenon has prompted decades of

  behaviour for an experimental interaction rule","Work in progress - 5 pages, 4 figures",,,,"nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computational models of collective behavior in birds has allowed us to infer
interaction rules directly from experimental data. Using a generic form of
these rules we explore the collective behavior and emergent dynamics of a
simulated swarm. For a wide range of flock size and interaction extent (the
fixed number of neighbors with which an individual will interact) we find that
the computational collective is inherently stable --- individuals are attracted
to one another and will position themselves a preferred distance from their
fixed neighbors within a rigid lattice. Nonetheless, the irregular overall
shape of the flock, coupled with the need for individuals on the boundary to
move towards their neighbors creates a torque which leads the flock to rotate
and then meander. We argue that this ""rolling meander"" is a very good proxy for
real collective behavior in animal species and yet arises from a simple
homogeneous and deterministic rule for interaction. Rather than then introduce
leaders --- which has already been shown, quite straightforwardly, to drive
collective swarms such as this --- we introduce a small number of ""followers"".
Each follower is bound to consider a random fixed individual to be among their
neighbors, irrespective of actual metric distance between them. We find that
the introduction of a small number of such followers causes a phase transition
that quickly leads to instability in the flock structure (as no stable
configuration arises) and the previously rigid crystalline interaction among
neighbors now becomes fluid: the distance between neighbors decreases, the
flock ceases to rotate and meanders less.

effectively refute pseudoscientific claims according to which the challenge

challenge. Pseudoscience exploits well meaning engagement in argument to create
the appearance of an expert dispute (sowing doubt). DRC decline to discuss
""until the challenge is met"", without solidifying the perception of
establishment conspiracy. This requires transparency, thus DRC are efficient
didactic tools. The Quantum Randi Challenge (QRC) is a DRC designed to reject
hidden variable models by simply teaching QM; there is no bet or interaction
with challengers. The QRC is a computer game that anybody can modify. The
present version includes a simulation of true QM behavior that violates Bell
99% of the time, hidden variables that violate the Bell and CHSH inequality
with 50% probability, and ones which violate Bell 85% of the time when missing
13% anti-correlation. The DRC challenge is to modify the hidden variables so
that the predicted QM behavior arises, including anti-correlation. If such were
possible, the presented programs would make it trivial to meet the challenge.
This fact and the whole QRC can be taught to a wide audience via the presented
heuristics. Demanding anti-correlation is argued to be superior to employing
CHSH.

attempt to fill this gap. We put forth two ideas: 1) A general network can be
decomposed into small building blocks of PNC, referred to as the PNC atoms, for
scheduling of PNC transmissions. 2) We identify nine PNC atoms, with TWRC being
one of them. Three major results are as follows. First, using the decomposition
framework, the throughput performance of PNC is shown to be significantly
better than those of the traditional multi-hop scheme and the conventional
network coding scheme. For example, under heavy traffic volume, PNC can achieve
100% throughput gain relative to the traditional multi-hop scheme. Second, PNC
decomposition based on a variety of different PNC atoms can yield much better
performance than PNC decomposition based on the TWRC atom alone. Third, three
out of the nine atoms are most important to good performance. Specifically, the
decomposition based on these three atoms is good enough most of the time, and
it is not necessary to use the other six atoms.

to the strong interaction and crucial to its connection with weak interaction
physics. We show that dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (DCSB) suppresses the
axial-charge of a dressed-quark, g_A^q, at infrared momenta. Since this effect
disappears as chiral symmetry is restored, one may argue that g_A vanishes with
the restoration of chiral symmetry because no nucleon bound-state survives the
associated transition. The suppression of g_A^q is shown to be part of an
explanation for a 25% reduction of g_A from its nonrelativistic quark-model
value. Critical too, however, is the presence of dressed-quark angular momentum
within the nucleon. The value of g_A^q depends on the kernels of the gap and
Bethe-Salpeter equations. We find that incorporation of essentially
nonperturbative effects associated with DCSB into these kernels inflates the
value relative to that obtained at leading-order in a widely used truncation of
QCD's Dyson-Schwinger equations. Such corrections also affect the nucleon's
axial radius. In both cases, however, agreement with experiment will require
similar improvements to the Faddeev kernel and associated interaction current.

mid-IR imaging that resolved the dust envelope of V1280 Sco, and SINFONI/VLT
observations secured in 2011. We report the discovery of a dusty
hourglass-shaped bipolar nebula. The apparent size of the nebula increased from
0.30"" x 0.17"" in July 2009 to 0.64"" x 0.42"" in July 2011. The aspect ratio
suggests that the source is seen at high inclination. The central source shines
efficiently in the K band and represents more than 56+/-5% of the total flux in
2009, and 87+/-6% in 2011. A mean expansion rate of 0.39+/-0.03 mas per day is
inferred from the VISIR observations in the direction of the major axis, which
represents a projected upper limit. Assuming that the dust shell expands in
that direction as fast as the low-excitation slow ejecta detected in
spectroscopy, this yields a lower limit distance to V1280 Sco of 1kpc; however,
the systematic errors remain large due to the complex shape and velocity field
of the dusty ejecta. The dust seems to reside essentially in the polar caps and
no infrared flux is detected in the equatorial regions in the latest dataset.
This may imply that the mass-loss was dominantly polar.

  In General Relativity, spacetime singularities raise a number of problems,
both mathematical and physical. One can identify a class of singularities -
with smooth but degenerate metric - which, under a set of conditions, allow us
to define proper geometric invariants, and to write field equations, including
equations which are equivalent to Einstein's at non-singular points, but remain
well-defined and smooth at singularities. This class of singularities is large
enough to contain isotropic singularities, warped-product singularities,
including the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker singularities, etc. Also a
Big-Bang singularity of this type automatically satisfies Penrose's Weyl
curvature hypothesis.
  The Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, and Kerr-Newman singularities

they become benign. The charged black hole solutions Reissner-Nordstrom and

benign singularities, because some of their properties correspond to a

environment for cloud formation and evolution in the bar region is expected to
be different from that in the spiral arm region, barred galaxies are a good
target to study the environmental effects on cloud formation and the subsequent
star formation. Our simulation uses for an initial 80 Myr an isothermal flow of
non-self gravitating gas in the barred potential, then including radiative
cooling, heating and self-gravitation of the gas for the next 40 Myr, during
which dense clumps are formed. We identify many cold, dense gas clumps for
which the mass is more than $10^4M_{\odot}$ (a value corresponding to the
molecular clouds) and study the physical properties of these clumps. The
relation of the velocity dispersion of the identified clump's internal motion
with the clump size is similar to that observed in the molecular clouds of our
Galaxy. We find that the virial parameters for clumps in the bar region are
larger than that in the spiral arm region. From our numerical results, we
estimate star formation in the bar and spiral arm regions by applying the
simple model of Krumholtz and McKee (2005). The mean relation between star
formation rate and gas surface density agrees well with the observed
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. The SFE in the bar region is $\sim 60 %$ of the
spiral arm region. This trend is consistent with observations of barred

Channel (GCCIC), which consists of two source-destination pairs that share the
same channel and where one full-duplex cognitive source can causally learn the
message of the primary source through a noisy link. The GCCIC is an
interference channel with unilateral source cooperation that better models
practical cognitive radio networks than the commonly used model which assumes
that one source has perfect non-causal knowledge of the other source's message.
First the sum-capacity of the symmetric GCCIC is determined to within a
constant gap. Then, the insights gained from the derivation of the symmetric
sum-capacity are extended to characterize the whole capacity region to within a
constant gap for more general cases. In particular, the capacity is determined
(a) to within 2 bits for the fully connected GCCIC when, roughly speaking, the
interference is not weak at both receivers, (b) to within 2 bits for the
Z-channel, i.e., when there is no interference from the primary user, and (c)
to within 2 bits for the S-channel, i.e., when there is no interference from
the secondary user. The parameter regimes where the GCCIC is equivalent, in
terms of generalized degrees-of-freedom, to the noncooperative interference
channel (i.e., unilateral causal cooperation is not useful), to the non-causal
cognitive interference channel (i.e., causal cooperation attains the ultimate
limit of cognitive radio technology), and to bilateral source cooperation are
identified. These comparisons shed lights into the parameter regimes and
network topologies that in practice might provide an unbounded throughput gain
compared to currently available (non cognitive) technologies.

extensive literature concerning improved estimators in such situations. In the
absence of further knowledge about the structure of the true covariance matrix,
the most successful approach so far, arguably, has been shrinkage estimation.
Shrinking the sample covariance matrix to a multiple of the identity, by taking
a weighted average of the two, turns out to be equivalent to linearly shrinking
the sample eigenvalues to their grand mean, while retaining the sample
eigenvectors. Our paper extends this approach by considering nonlinear
transformations of the sample eigenvalues. We show how to construct an
estimator that is asymptotically equivalent to an oracle estimator suggested in
previous work. As demonstrated in extensive Monte Carlo simulations, the
resulting bona fide estimator can result in sizeable improvements over the
sample covariance matrix and also over linear shrinkage.

only two molecules, OCS and SO2, have been detected in interstellar ices but
cannot account for the elemental abundance of sulphur observed in diffuse
medium. Chemical models suggest that solid H2S is the main form of sulphur in
denser sources but observational constraints exist that infirm this hypothesis.
We have used the Nautilus gas-grain code in which new chemical reactions have
been added, based on recent experiments of H2S ice irradiation with UV photons
and high energy protons. In particular, we included the new species Sn, H2Sn
and C2S. We found that at the low temperature observed in dense clouds, i.e. 10
K, these new molecules are not efficiently produced and our modifications of
the network do not change the previous pre- dictions. At slightly higher
temperature, 20 K in less dense clouds or in the proximity of protostars, H2S
abundance on the surfaces is strongly decreased in favor of the polysulfanes
H2S3. Such a result can also be obtained if the diffusion barriers on the
grains are less im- portant. In the context of the life cycle of interstellar
clouds and the mixing between diffuse and denser parts of the clouds, the
depletion of sulphur in the form of polysulfanes or other sulphur polymers, may
have occurred in regions where the temperature is slightly higher than the cold
inner parts of the clouds.

implying a young characteristic age of 4970 years and a large spin-down power
of 5.9e36 erg/s. Follow-up observations with radio telescopes detected no
pulsations, thus PSR J1838-0537 appears radio-quiet as viewed from Earth. In
September 2009 the pulsar suffered the largest glitch so far seen in any
gamma-ray-only pulsar, causing a relative increase in spin frequency of about
5.5e-6. After the glitch, during a putative recovery period, the timing
analysis is complicated by the sparsity of the LAT photon data, the weakness of
the pulsations, and the reduction in average exposure from a coincidental,
contemporaneous change in the LAT's sky-survey observing pattern. The pulsar's
sky position is coincident with the spatially extended TeV source HESS

follows a Maxwellian distribution which variance is consistent with the
prediction of the linear theory of structure formation. We propose that the
consistency between the observed bulk velocity and theories should be examined
at the effective scale of the radius of a spherical top-hat window function
yielding the same smoothed velocity variance in linear theory as the sample
window function does. We compared some recently estimated bulk flows from
observational samples with the prediction of the \Lambda CDM model we used;
some results deviate from expectation at a level of ~ 3\sigma but the
discrepancy is not as severe as previously claimed. We show that bulk flow is
only weakly correlated with the dipole of the internal mass distribution, the
alignment angle between the mass dipole and the bulk flow has a broad
distribution peaked at ~ 30-50 deg., and also that the bulk flow shows little
dependence on the mass of the halos used in the estimation. In a simulation of
box size 1Gpc/h, for a cell of radius 100 Mpc/h the maximal bulk velocity is
>500 km/s, dipoles of the environmental mass outside the cell are not tightly
aligned with the bulk flow, but are rather located randomly around it with
separation angles ~ 20-40 deg. In the fastest cell there is a slightly smaller
number of low-mass halos; however halos inside are clustered more strongly at
scales > ~ 20 Mpc/h, which might be a significant feature since the correlation
between bulk flow and halo clustering actually increases in significance beyond
such scales.

have a profound impact on our theories of the early Universe. Such correlations
could also become a sensitive diagnostic of some particularly insidious
instrumental systematics. In this work we introduce three different unbiased
estimators based on the so-called standard and pure pseudo-spectrum techniques
and later assess their performance by means of extensive Monte Carlo
simulations performed for different experimental configurations. We find that a
hybrid approach combining a pure estimate of B-mode multipoles with a standard

polarization-related angular power spectra i.e. EE, BB and TE$. However, if
both E and B multipoles are estimated using the pure technique the loss of
precision for the EB spectrum is not larger than ~30%. Moreover, for the
experimental configurations considered here, the statistical uncertainties --
due to sampling variance and instrumental noise -- of the pseudo-spectrum
estimates is at most a factor ~1.4 for TT, EE and TE spectra and a factor ~2

excited oscillator to the localization on the attached oscillator. In the
strongly nonlinear systems, the transition from the energy localization to
strong energy exchange between the oscillators is revealed. A special case of
the rapid irreversible energy transfer in the strongly nonlinear system with
slowly-varying parameters is also investigated. The conditions providing
different types of the dynamical behavior are derived. Explicit approximate
solutions describing the transient processes in moderately and strongly
nonlinear systems are suggested. Correctness of the constructed approximations
is confirmed by numerical results.

Loop I. This shell is thought to be the expanding boundary of an interstellar
bubble inflated and recently reheated by the strong stellar winds of the nearby

Loop I. Interstellar NaI 5889-5895 and CaII K-H 3934-3968 {\AA} are modeled and
compared with the HI emission spectra from the LAB Survey. About two-thirds of
our stellar spectra possess narrow interstellar lines. Narrow lines are located
at the velocity of the main, low-velocity Loop 1 HI shell ([-6,+1] km/s in the

variance with this shell, the second HI structure, which is characterized by
LSR Doppler velocities centered at -30 km/s, is NOT detected in any of the

sticking and growth, bouncing, or fragmentation. The outcome of such collisions
depends on the collision speed, so we need a solid understanding of the rate
and velocity distribution of turbulence-induced dust grain collisions. The rate
of the collisions depends both on the speed of the collisions and the degree of
clustering experienced by the dust grains, which is a known outcome of
turbulence. We evolve the motion of dust grains in simulated turbulence, an
approach that allows a large turbulent inertial range making it possible to
investigate the effect of turbulence on meso-scale grains (millimeter and
centimeter). We find three populations of dust grains: one highly clustered,
cold and collisionless; one warm; and the third ""hot"". Our results can be fit
by a simple formula, and predict both significantly slower typical collisional
velocities for a given turbulent strength than previously considered, and
modest effective clustering of the collisional populations, easing difficulties
associated with bouncing and fragmentation barriers to dust grain growth.
Nonetheless, the rate of high velocity collisions falls off merely
exponentially with relative velocity so some mid- or high-velocity collisions
will still occur, promising some fragmentation.

shows that there is indeed a cut-off wavenumber, i.e. the Alfven waves with
wavenumbers higher than the cut-off value are evanescent. The cut-off
wavenumber appears in single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) approximation but
it is absent in a multi-fluid approach. Up to now, an explanation for the
existence of the cut-off wavenumber is still missing. The aim of this paper is
to point out the reason for the appearance of a cut-off wavenumber in
single-fluid MHD. Beginning with three-fluid equations (with electrons, protons
and neutral hydrogen atoms), we performed consecutive approximations until we
obtained the usual single-fluid description is obtained. We solved the
dispersion relation of linear Alfven waves at each step and sought the
approximation responsible of the cut-off wavenumber appearance. We have found
that neglecting inertial terms significantly reduces the real part of the
Alfven frequency although it never becomes zero. Therefore, the cut-off
wavenumber does not exist at this stage. However, when the inertial terms
together with the Hall term in the induction equation are neglected, the real
part of the Alfven frequency becomes zero. The appearance of a cut-off
wavenumber, when Alfven waves in partially ionized regions of the solar
atmosphere are studied, is the result of neglecting inertial and Hall terms,
therefore it has no physical origin.

information. However, quantile regression is not equipped with a parametric
likelihood, and therefore, Bayesian inference for quantile regression demands
careful investigation. This paper considers the Bayesian empirical likelihood
approach to quantile regression. Taking the empirical likelihood into a
Bayesian framework, we show that the resultant posterior from any fixed prior
is asymptotically normal; its mean shrinks toward the true parameter values,
and its variance approaches that of the maximum empirical likelihood estimator.
A more interesting case can be made for the Bayesian empirical likelihood when
informative priors are used to explore commonality across quantiles. Regression
quantiles that are computed separately at each percentile level tend to be
highly variable in the data sparse areas (e.g., high or low percentile levels).
Through empirical likelihood, the proposed method enables us to explore various
forms of commonality across quantiles for efficiency gains. By using an MCMC
algorithm in the computation, we avoid the daunting task of directly maximizing
empirical likelihood. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is
investigated empirically, where substantial efficiency gains are demonstrated
with informative priors on common features across several percentile levels. A
theoretical framework of shrinking priors is used in the paper to better
understand the power of the proposed method.

kinetic effects in a two-dimensional turbulent multi-ion plasma, composed of
protons, alpha particles and fluid electrons. In the typical conditions of the
solar-wind environment, and in situations of decaying turbulence, the numerical
results show that the velocity distribution functions of both ion species
depart from the typical configuration of thermal equilibrium. These
non-Maxwellian features are quantified through the statistical analysis of the
temperature anisotropy, for both protons and alpha particles, in the reference
frame given by the local magnetic field. Anisotropy is found to be higher in
regions of high magnetic stress. Both ion species manifest a preferentially
perpendicular heating, although the anisotropy is more pronounced for the alpha
particles, according with solar wind observations. Anisotropy of the alpha
particle, moreover, is correlated to the proton anisotropy, and also depends on
the local differential flow between the two species. Evident distortions of the
particle distribution functions are present, with the production of bumps along
the direction of the local magnetic field. The physical phenomenology recovered
in these numerical simulations reproduces very common measurements in the
turbulent solar wind, suggesting that the multi-ion Vlasov model constitutes a
valid approach to the understanding of the nature of complex kinetic effects in
astrophysical plasmas.

summarize some theoretical approaches to self-organized criticality (SOC)
phenomena that involve percolation as an essential key ingredient. Scaling
arguments, random walk models, linear-response theory, and fractional kinetic
equations of the diffusion and relaxation type are presented on an equal
footing with theoretical approaches of greater sophistication, such as the
formalism of discrete Anderson nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation, Hamiltonian
pseudochaos, conformal maps, and fractional derivative equations of the
nonlinear Schr\""odinger and Ginzburg-Landau type. Several physical consequences
are described which are relevant to transport processes in complex systems. It
is shown that a state of self-organized criticality may be unstable against a
bursting (""fishbone"") mode when certain conditions are met. Finally we discuss
SOC-associated phenomena, such as: self-organized turbulence in the Earth's
magnetotail (in terms of the ""Sakura"" model), phase transitions in SOC systems,
mixed SOC-coherent behavior, and periodic and auto-oscillatory patterns of
behavior. Applications of the above pertain to phenomena of magnetospheric
substorm, market crashes, and the global climate change and are also discussed
in some detail. Finally we address the frontiers in the field in association
with the emerging projects in fusion research and space exploration.

In the presence of
turbulence with a weak mean magnetic field, a large-scale instability resulting
in the formation of non-uniform magnetic structures, can be excited over the
scale of many turbulent eddies or convection cells. This instability is caused
by a negative contribution of turbulence to the effective (mean-field) magnetic
pressure and has previously been discussed in connection with the formation of
active regions and perhaps sunspots. We want to understand the effects of
rotation on this instability in both two and three dimensions. We use
mean-field magnetohydrodynamics in a parameter regime in which the properties
of the negative effective magnetic pressure instability have previously been
found to be in agreement with those of direct numerical simulations. We find
that the instability is suppressed already for relatively slow rotation with
Coriolis numbers (i.e. inverse Rossby numbers) around 0.2. The suppression is
strongest at the equator. In the nonlinear regime, we find traveling wave
solutions with propagation in the prograde direction at the equator with
additional poleward migration away from the equator. The prograde rotation of
the magnetic pattern near the equator is argued to be a possible explanation
for the faster rotation speed of magnetic tracers found on the Sun. In the bulk
of the domain, kinetic and current helicities are negative in the northern
hemisphere and positive in the southern.

be inferred for a small number of ultracool white dwarfs for which an accurate
distance is known, by fitting their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in
conjunction with a theoretical mass-radius relation. However, the mass-radius

model-dependent. Here we report direct measurements of the mass and radius of
an ultracool white dwarf in the double-lined eclipsing binary SDSS

R(WD)=0.0131+/-0.0003Rsol. Our measurements are consistent with the mass-radius

is still active, far beyond the activity lifetime for a star of its spectral

time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculation). The structures
of four thiol ligands, namely - cysteine (Cys), mercaptopropionic acid (MPA),
and their reduced-chain analogues, are investigated. We have documented
significant passivation effects of the surfactants upon the structure and the
optical absorption properties of the CdSe quantum dots: The surface Cd-Se bonds
are weakened, whereas the core bonds are strengthened. A blue shift of the
absorption spectrum by ~0.2 eV is observed. Also, the optical absorption
intensity is enhanced by the passivation. By contrast, we have observed that
varying the length of ligands yields only a minor effect upon the absorption
properties: a shorter alkane chain might induce a slightly stronger interaction
between the -NH2 group and the nearest surface Se atom, which is observed as a
stronger ligand binding energy. For Cd12Se12, which is regarded as the
'non-magic' size QD, neither the self-relaxation nor the ligand passivation
could fully stabilize the structure or improve the poor electronic properties.
We also observe that the category of thiol ligands possesses a better ability
to open the band gap of CdSe QD than either phosphine oxide or amine ligands.
Our estimation of the absorption peak of the Cys-capped QDs ranges from 413 nm
to 460 nm, which is consistent to the experimental peak as 422 nm.

Telescopes is that their size (and hence cost) scales rapidly with telescope
aperture. To try to break this relation alternative new technologies have been
proposed, such as the use of the Integrated Photonic Spectrograph (IPS). Due to
their diffraction limited nature the IPS is claimed to defeat the harsh scaling
law applying to conventional instruments. The problem with astronomical
applications is that unlike conventional photonics, they are not usually fed by
diffraction limited sources. This means in order to retain throughput and
spatial information the IPS will require multiple Arrayed Waveguide Gratings
(AWGs) and a photonic lantern. We investigate the implications of these extra
components on the size of the instrument. We also investigate the potential
size advantage of using an IPS as opposed to conventional monolithic optics. To
do this, we have constructed toy models of IPS and conventional image sliced
spectrographs to calculate the relative instrument sizes and their requirements
in terms of numbers of detector pixels. Using these models we can quantify the
relative size/cost advantage for different types of instrument, by varying
different parameters e.g. multiplex gain and spectral resolution. This is
accompanied by an assessment of the uncertainties in these predictions, which
may prove crucial for the planning of future instrumentation for
highly-multiplexed spectroscopy.

  Theory (SAGT)",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Network creation games model the creation and usage costs of networks formed
by a set of selfish peers. Each peer has the ability to change the network in a
limited way, e.g., by creating or deleting incident links. In doing so, a peer
can reduce its individual communication cost. Typically, these costs are
modeled by the maximum or average distance in the network. We introduce a
generalized version of the basic network creation game (BNCG). In the BNCG (by
Alon et al., SPAA 2010), each peer may replace one of its incident links by a
link to an arbitrary peer. This is done in a selfish way in order to minimize
either the maximum or average distance to all other peers. That is, each peer
works towards a network structure that allows himself to communicate
efficiently with all other peers. However, participants of large networks are
seldom interested in all peers. Rather, they want to communicate efficiently
only with a small subset of peers. Our model incorporates these (communication)
interests explicitly. In the MAX-version, each node tries to minimize its
maximum distance to nodes it is interested in.
  Given peers with interests and a communication network forming a tree, we
prove several results on the structure and quality of equilibria in our model.
For the MAX-version, we give an upper worst case bound of O(\sqrt{n}) for the
private costs in an equilibrium of n peers. Moreover, we give an equilibrium
for a circular interest graph where a node has private cost \Omega(\sqrt{n}),
showing that our bound is tight. This example can be extended such that we get
a tight bound of \Theta(\sqrt{n}) for the price of anarchy. For the case of
general communication networks we show the price of anarchy to be \Theta(n).
Additionally, we prove an interesting connection between a maximum independent
set in the interest graph and the private costs of the peers.

no such radiation from the boundary surface. To resolve the information paradox
we need to show that there are real degrees of freedom at the horizon of the

As a solution to these complications, clustering schemes are proposed for MANET

clustering techniques have been developed. Clustering is a method which
aggregates nodes into groups. These groups are contained by the network and
they are known as clusters. By Increasing network capacity and reducing the
routing overhead through clustering brings more efficiency and effectiveness to
scalability in relation to node numbers and the necessity for high mobility.
The manager node in clustering has responsibility for many functions such as
cluster maintenance, routing table updates, and the discovery of new routes
within the network. The other node named as gateway node communicate to the
other cluster. In this paper we remove the cluster head (CH) and given a new
approach in which cluster head and gateway will be same and that node is known
as cluster head gateway (CHG), in which all the responsibilities of cluster
head and gateway will be perform by the Cluster head gateway(CHG) itself. By
applying this approach we reduce of overheads and improve the over all
performance of the network while throughput will be same in both condition with
the help of Exata simulation.
