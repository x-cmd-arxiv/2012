for increasing Fermi energy the magnetoconductance of a diffusive system with
inverted band ordering features a transition from WL to WAL and back, if
spin-orbit interactions from bulk and structure inversion asymmetry can be
neglected. This, and an additional splitting in the magnetoconductance profile,
is a signature of the Berry phase arising for inverted band ordering and not
present in heterostructures with conventional ordering. In presence of
spin-orbit interaction both band topologies exhibit WAL, which is distinctly
energy dependent solely for quantum wells with inverted band ordering. This can
be explained by an energy-dependent decomposition of the Hamiltonian into two

Such information-as it has proved to be in the Hilbert-Schmidt

reconstruction (inverse) procedures, in obtaining improved, or possibly even
exact Bures 2 x 2 separability probabilities for such systems. The
(regularizing) strategy we first adopt is to plot the ratio of
numerically-generated (Ginibre ensemble) estimates of the Bures moments to the
corresponding (apparently) exactly-known Hilbert-Schmidt moments (J. Phys. A,
45, 095305 [2012]). Then, through a combination of symbolic and numerical
computations, we obtain strong evidence as to the exact values (and underlying
patterns) of certain Bures moments. In particular, the first moment (average)
of |rho^{PT}| (where |rho^{PT}| in [-1/16, 1/256]), PT denoting partial
transpose, for the two-qubit systems is, remarkably, -1 / 256. The analogous
value for the two-rebit systems is -2663/(2^(13) x 3 x 5 x 7) approx
-0.00309594. While, an important function in the Hilbert-Schmidt case is the
ratio of 3n-degree polynomials, it appears to be the ratio of 5n-degree

models. For a pilot subsample of the KINGFISH program, we perform 2 temperature
fits of the Spitzer and Herschel photometric data (24 to 500um), with a warm
and a cold component, globally and in each resolution element.At global scales,
we observe ranges of values for beta_c(0.8 to 2.5) and Tc(19.1 to 25.1K).We
compute maps of our parameters with beta fixed or free to test the robustness
of the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. When the emissivity
is fixed, we observe temperature gradients as a function of radius.When the
emissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniform
fitted emissivities.Gathering resolved elements in a Tc-beta_c diagram
underlines an anti-correlation between the two parameters.It remains difficult
to assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, or
mixing along the line of sight and in the beam. We finally observe in both
cases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and bar
ends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in these
locations).We also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptions
about the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverage
used in the fits. We show that modified blackbody fits using a shallow
emissivity (beta_c < 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared to
the beta_c < 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50% if beta_c=1.5 for
instance.The working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: masses
increase from global fits to spatially-resolved fits.

contributions to muon g-2 and corrections to electroweak observables, and show
the consistent region of parameter space. We find that in a simple model where
the chirality flip of muon occurs only in the external muon line in one-loop
muon g-2 diagrams, it is necessary to introduce the relatively large new Yukawa
coupling and the electroweak scale new particles. On the other hand, in a model
where the chirality flip can occur in the internal fermion line of one loop
muon g-2 diagrams, we can obtain favorable g-2 contributions without large
Yukawa coupling, and they are consistent with the precision electroweak
observables. Finally, we discuss effects of new particles for muon g-2 on the
Higgs boson decay h to 2 photons and direct productions of these particles at
the LHC experiment.

Ising model on a general triangular lattice in an infinite-strip geometry with
periodic, antiperiodic, and free boundary conditions (bc) in the finite
direction are investigated. Exact results are obtained for the scaling
functions of the finite-size contributions to the free energy density. With
xi_> the largest and xi_< the smallest bulk correlation length at a given
temperature near criticality, we find that the dependence of these functions on
the ratio xi_< / xi_> and on the angle parameterizing the orientation of the
correlation volume is of geometric rather than dynamic origin. Since the
scaling functions are independent of the particular microscopic realization of
the anisotropy within the two-dimensional Ising model, our results provide a
limited verification of universality. We explain our observations by
considering finite-size scaling of free energy densities of general weakly
anisotropic models on a d-dimensional film, i.e., in an L x infinity^(d-1)
geometry, with bc in the finite direction that are invariant under a shear
transformation relating the anisotropic and isotropic cases. This allows us to
relate free energy scaling functions in the presence of an anisotropy to those
of the corresponding isotropic system. We interpret our results as a simple and
transparent case of anisotropic universality, where, compared to the isotropic
case, scaling functions depend additionally on the shape and orientation of the
correlation volume. We conjecture that this universality extends to cases where
the geometry and/or the bc are not invariant under the shear transformation and
argue in favor of validity of two-scale factor universality for anisotropic
systems.

in this paper we will examine several state of the art exhaustive search

non-exhaustive search strategies such as evolutionary algorithms, since their

the results for $T_c(\alpha)$ in ${\rm F_1F_2S}$ systems are clearly different
from those in ${\rm F_1 S F_2}$ systems, where $T_c$ monotonically increases
with $\alpha$ and is highest for antiparallel magnetizations. Here,
$T_c(\alpha)$ is in general a non-monotonic function, and often has a minimum
near $\alpha \approx 80^{\circ}$. For certain values of the exchange field and
layer thicknesses, the system exhibits reentrant superconductivity with
$\alpha$: it transitions from superconducting to normal, and then returns to a
superconducting state again with increasing $\alpha$. This phenomenon is
substantiated by a calculation of the condensation energy. We compute, in
addition to the ordinary singlet pair amplitude, the induced odd triplet
pairing amplitudes. The results indicate a connection between equal-spin
triplet pairing and the singlet pairing state that characterizes $T_c$. We find
also that the induced triplet amplitudes can be very long-ranged in both the S

Vondr\'ak [ESA 2011]). However, so far, there was no variant of the matroid
secretary problem with adversarial weight assignment for which a
constant-factor approximation was found. We address this point by presenting a
9-approximation for the \emph{free order model}, a model suggested shortly
after the introduction of the matroid secretary problem, and for which no
constant-factor approximation was known so far. The free order model is a
relaxed version of the original matroid secretary problem, with the only
difference that one can choose the order in which secretaries are interviewed.
  Furthermore, we consider the classical matroid secretary problem for the
special case of laminar matroids. Only recently, a constant-factor
approximation has been found for this case, using a clever but rather involved
method and analysis (Im and Wang, [SODA 2011]) that leads to a
16000/3-approximation. This is arguably the most involved special case of the
matroid secretary problem for which a constant-factor approximation is known.
We present a considerably simpler and stronger $3\sqrt{3}e\approx
14.12$-approximation, based on reducing the problem to a matroid secretary
problem on a partition matroid.

both basic and extended versions of weak and perfect security notions. In the
generalized Russian cards problem, three players, Alice, Bob, and Cathy, are
dealt a deck of $n$ cards, each given $a$, $b$, and $c$ cards, respectively.
The goal is for Alice and Bob to learn each other's hands via public
communication, without Cathy learning the fate of any particular card. The
basic idea is that Alice announces a set of possible hands she might hold, and
Bob, using knowledge of his own hand, should be able to learn Alice's cards
from this announcement, but Cathy should not. Using a combinatorial approach,
we are able to give a nice characterization of informative strategies (i.e.,
strategies allowing Bob to learn Alice's hand), having optimal communication
complexity, namely the set of possible hands Alice announces must be equivalent
to a large set of $t-(n, a, 1)$-designs, where $t=a-c$. We also provide some
interesting necessary conditions for certain types of deals to be
simultaneously informative and secure. That is, for deals satisfying $c = a-d$
for some $d \geq 2$, where $b \geq d-1$ and the strategy is assumed to satisfy
a strong version of security (namely perfect $(d-1)$-security), we show that $a
= d+1$ and hence $c=1$. We also give a precise characterization of informative

codes, thus demonstrating that structure can be beneficial even in cases where
there is no capacity gain. We show that if the MAC channel is modulo-additive,
then any error probability, and hence any error exponent, achievable by a
linear code for the corresponding single-user channel, is also achievable for
the MAC channel. Specifically, for an alphabet of prime cardinality, where
linear codes achieve the best known exponents in the single-user setting and
the optimal exponent above the critical rate, this performance carries over to
the MAC setting. At least at low rates, where expurgation is needed, our
approach strictly improves performance over previous results, where expurgation
was used at most for one of the users. Even when the MAC channel is not
additive, it may be transformed into such a channel. While the transformation
is lossy, we show that the distributed structure gain in some ""nearly additive""
cases outweighs the loss, and thus the error exponent can improve upon the best
known error exponent for these cases as well. Finally we apply a similar
approach to the Gaussian MAC channel. We obtain an improvement over the best
known achievable exponent, given by Gallager, for certain rate pairs, using
lattice codes which satisfy a nesting condition.

It achieves dimension reduction by a Petrov--Galerkin projection associated

hyper-reduction procedure based on the `gappy POD' technique. Originally
presented in Ref. [1], where it was applied to implicit nonlinear
structural-dynamics models, this method is further developed here and applied
to the solution of a benchmark turbulent viscous flow problem. To begin, this
paper develops global state-space error bounds that justify the method's design
and highlight its advantages in terms of minimizing components of these error
bounds. Next, the paper introduces a `sample mesh' concept that enables a
distributed, computationally efficient implementation of the GNAT method in
finite-volume-based computational-fluid-dynamics (CFD) codes. The suitability
of GNAT for parameterized problems is highlighted with the solution of an
academic problem featuring moving discontinuities. Finally, the capability of
this method to reduce by orders of magnitude the core-hours required for
large-scale CFD computations, while preserving accuracy, is demonstrated with
the simulation of turbulent flow over the Ahmed body. For an instance of this
benchmark problem with over 17 million degrees of freedom, GNAT outperforms
several other nonlinear model-reduction methods, reduces the required

Considering a wide range of coupling schemes, we derive antiproton and direct
detection constraints using the latest data and paying close attention to
astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties. Both signals are strongly enhanced in
the presence of degenerate dark matter and scalar masses, but we show that the
effect is especially dramatic in direct detection. Accordingly, the latest
direct detection limits take the lead over antiprotons. We find that antiproton
and direct detection data set stringent lower limits on the mass splitting,
reaching 19% at a 300 GeV dark matter mass for a unity coupling. Interestingly,
these limits are orthogonal to ongoing collider searches at the Large Hadron

hemispherical shell morphology in X-rays and in the radio band. In this work we
report the detection of {\gamma}-ray emission coincident with CTB 109, using 37
months of data from the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space
Telescope. We study the broadband characteristics of the remnant using a model
that includes hydrodynamics, efficient cosmic ray acceleration, nonthermal
emission and a self-consistent calculation of the X-ray thermal emission. We
find that the observations can be successfully fit with two distinct parameter
sets, one where the {\gamma}-ray emission is produced primarily by leptons
accelerated at the SNR forward shock and the other where {\gamma}-rays produced
by forward shock accelerated cosmic-ray ions dominate the high-energy emission.
Consideration of thermal X-ray emission introduces a novel element to the
broadband fitting process, and while it does not rule out either the leptonic
or the hadronic scenarios, it constrains the parameter sets required by the
model to fit the observations. Moreover, the model which best fits the thermal
and nonthermal emission observations is an intermediate case, where both
radiation from accelerated electrons and hadrons contribute almost equally to
the {\gamma}-ray flux observed.

transversely polarized quark with the sine of the polar angle, $\varphi$,
between the produced hadron's transverse momentum and the quark spin. We employ
a quark-jet model to describe multiple hadron emissions by such a quark, taking
the Collins effect into account. The resulting hadron distributions exhibit
modulation up to fourth order in $\sin(\varphi)$ when only two hadron emissions
are allowed, rising with any further increase in the number of emitted hadrons.
These new effects are a direct consequence of the quark-jet mechanism for quark
hadronization, which do not depend on the details of the model used for
elementary hadron emission. The size and the sign of the higher order terms are
directly connected with the probabilities of quark spin flip in the elementary
emission process, with opposing sign favored and unfavored Collins functions
only being generated if quark spin flip is preferential. Experimental studies
of these effects should therefore provide a critical test of the quark
hadronization mechanism, which in turn will lead to a deeper understanding of
the transverse spin structure of hadrons.

J1550-5418 bursts simultaneously detected with the Swift/X-ray Telescope (XRT)

episode of the source. The unique spectral and temporal capabilities of the XRT
Windowed Timing mode have allowed us to extend the GBM spectral coverage for
these events down to the X-ray domain (0.5-10 keV). Our earlier analysis of the
GBM data found that the SGR J1550-5418 burst spectra were described equally
well with a Comptonized model or with two blackbody functions; the two models
were statistically indistinguishable. Our new broadband (0.5 - 200 keV)
spectral fits show that, on average, the burst spectra are better described
with two blackbody functions than with the Comptonized model. Thus, our joint
XRT/GBM analysis clearly shows for the first time that the SGR J1550-5418 burst
spectra might naturally be expected to exhibit a more truly thermalized
character, such as a two-blackbody or even a multi-blackbody signal. Using the
Swift and RXTE timing ephemeris for SGR J1550-5418 we construct the
distribution of the XRT burst counts with spin phase and find that it is not
correlated with the persistent X-ray emission pulse phase from SGR J1550-5418.
These results indicate that the burst emitting sites on the neutron star need
not be co-located with hot spots emitting the bulk of the persistent X-ray
emission. Finally, we show that there is a significant pulse phase dependence
of the XRT burst counts, likely demonstrating that the surface magnetic field
of SGR J1550-5418 is not uniform over the emission zone, since it is
anticipated that regions with stronger surface magnetic field could trigger
bursts more efficiently.

Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) without introducing excessive
fine-tuning, and this motivates the study of non-minimal implementations of low
energy supersymmetry (SUSY). A term \lambda SH_uH_d involving a Standard Model
(SM) singlet state S leads to an additional source for the quartic interaction
raising the mass of the lightest SM-like Higgs. However, in order to achieve
m_h \approx 125 GeV with light stops and small stop mixing, it is necessary for
\lambda \gtrsim 0.7 and consequently \lambda may become non-perturbative before
the unification scale. Moreover, as argued by Barbieri, Hall, et al. low
fine-tuning prefers the region \lambda~1-2, leading to new or non-perturbative
physics involving S below the GUT scale (`\lambda SUSY' models). This raises
the concern that precision gauge coupling unification, the prime piece of
indirect experimental evidence for low energy SUSY, may be upset. Using the
NSVZ exact \beta-function along with well motivated assumptions on the strong
coupling dynamics we show that this is not necessarily the case, but rather
there exist classes of UV completions where the strong-coupling effects can
naturally correct for the present ~3% discrepancy in the two-loop MSSM
unification prediction for \alpha_s. Moreover, we argue that in certain
scenarios a period of strong coupling can also be beneficial for t-b
unification, while maintaining the small to moderate values of tan\beta
preferred by the Higgs mass.

Fe-Ka variability was detected, with a spatial and temporal pattern consistent
with that reported in previous studies. The main breakthrough that sets our
paper apart from earlier contributions on this topic is the direct measurement
of the column density and the Fe abundance of the MCs in our sample. We used
the EW measurements to infer the average Fe abundance within the clouds to be
1.6$\pm$0.1 times solar. The cloud column densities derived from the spectral
analysis were typically of the order of 10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, which is
significantly higher than previous estimates. This in turn has a significant
impact on the inferred geometry and time delays within the cloud system. Past
X-ray activity of Sgr A* is the most likely source of ionisation within the
molecular clouds in the innermost 30 pc of the Galaxy. In this scenario, the
X-ray luminosity required to excite these reflection nebulae is of the order of
10$^{37}-10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, significantly lower than that estimated for the

150 years shows a long-term downwards trend punctuated by occasional
counter-trend brightening episodes of at least 5 years duration. Finally, we
found that contributions to the Fe fluorescence by X-ray transient binaries and
cosmic-ray bombardment are very likely, and suggest possible ways to study this

it is also important to compute observables with analytic methods. Here, we
present a global next-to-leading-log resummation of the angular correlation
function which measures the contribution to the mass of a jet from constituents
that are within an angle R with respect to one another. For a scale-invariant
jet, the angular correlation function should scale as a power of R. Deviations
from this behavior can be traced to the breaking of scale invariance in QCD. To
do the resummation, we use soft-collinear effective theory relying on the
recent proof of factorization of jet observables at e+ e- colliders.
Non-trivial requirements of factorization of the angular correlation function
are discussed. The calculation is compared to Monte Carlo parton shower and

greater accuracy with the new model. The nonlinear P_{\theta \theta} and

has therefore opened the possibility to create novel electronic structures. In
this work we study the ""hybrid"" heterostructure formed by one sheet of single

drive the system to a spontaneously broken symmetry state characterized by
interlayer phase coherence. The peculiarity of the SLG-BLG heterostructure is
that the electrons in the layers (SLG and BLG) have different chiralities. We
find that the difference of chirality between electrons in the two layers
causes the spontaneously broken symmetry state to be N-fold degenerate.
Moreover, we find that some of the degenerate states are chiral superfluid
states, topologically distinct from the usual layer-ferromagnetism. The chiral
nature of the ground state opens the possibility to realize protected midgap

U-band imaging survey of nearby star-forming galaxies. Thanks to the
information provided by the U band, together with archival Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) optical data, we are able to constrain reliable ages, masses,
and extinctions of the cluster populations of these galaxies. We show some
preliminary results from the study of one of the SHUCS galaxies, NGC 2146.
Using the recovered cluster ages we try to understand the propagation of the
star formation in one of the tidal streams where a ring-like cluster complex
has been found. The Ruby Ring, so named due to its appearance, shows a clear
ring-like distribution of star clusters around a central object. We find
evidence of a spatial and temporal correlation between the central cluster and
the clusters in the ring. The Ruby Ring is the product of an intense and
localised burst of star formation, similar to the extended cluster complexes
observed in M 51 and the Antennae, but more impressive because is quite
isolated. We discuss the formation of the Ruby Ring in a ""collect & collapse""
framework. The predictions made by this model agree quite well with the
estimated bubble radius and expansion velocity produced by the feedback from
the central cluster, making the Ruby Ring an interesting case of triggered star
formation.

present spectra for 12 of the faintest candidates from our deep multi-band

We confirm seven new sources as young very low mass objects (VLMOs), with Teff
of 2400-3100K and mid-M to early-L spectral types. These objects add to the
growing census of VLMOs in NGC1333, now totaling 58. Three confirmed objects
(one found in this study) have masses below 15 MJup, according to evolutionary
models, thus are likely planemos. We estimate the total planemo population with
5-15 MJup in NGC1333 is <~8. The mass spectrum in this cluster is well
approximated by dN/dM ~ M^-alpha, with a single value of alpha = 0.6+/-0.1 for
M<0.6Msol, consistent with other nearby star forming regions, and requires
alpha <~ 0.6 in the planemo domain. Our results in NGC1333, as well as findings
in several other clusters by ourselves and others, confirm that the star
formation process extends into the planetary-mass domain, at least down to 6
MJup. However, given that planemos are 20-50 times less numerous than stars,
their contribution to the object number and mass budget in young clusters is
negligible. Our findings disagree strongly with the recent claim from a
microlensing study that free-floating planetary-mass objects are twice as
common as stars - if the microlensing result is confirmed, those isolated
Jupiter-mass objects must have a different origin from brown dwarfs and
planemos observed in young clusters.

after the formation of a central star. Motivated by these observations, we
revisit the classic problem of steady, spherical accretion of gas onto a
gravitating point mass, but now include self-gravity of the gas and impose a
finite, subsonic velocity as the outer boundary condition. We find that the
accretion rate onto the protostar is lower than values obtained for isolated,
collapsing clouds, by a factor that is the Mach number of the outer flow.
Moreover, the region of infall surrounding the protostar spreads out more
slowly, at a speed close to the subsonic, incoming velocity. Our calculation,
while highly idealized, provides insight into two longstanding problems -- the
surprisingly low accretion luminosities of even the most deeply embedded
stellar sources, and the failure so far to detect spatially extended,
supersonic infall within their parent dense cores. Indeed, the observed
subsonic contraction in the outer regions of dense cores following star
formation appears to rule out a purely hydrodynamic origin for these clouds.

makers, and private investors. Several models have been proposed for predicting
technological improvement, but how well do these models perform? An early
hypothesis made by Theodore Wright in 1936 is that cost decreases as a power
law of cumulative production. An alternative hypothesis is Moore's law, which
can be generalized to say that technologies improve exponentially with time.
Other alternatives were proposed by Goddard, Sinclair et al., and Nordhaus.
These hypotheses have not previously been rigorously tested. Using a new
database on the cost and production of 62 different technologies, which is the
most expansive of its kind, we test the ability of six different postulated
laws to predict future costs. Our approach involves hindcasting and developing
a statistical model to rank the performance of the postulated laws. Wright's
law produces the best forecasts, but Moore's law is not far behind. We discover
a previously unobserved regularity that production tends to increase
exponentially. A combination of an exponential decrease in cost and an
exponential increase in production would make Moore's law and Wright's law
indistinguishable, as originally pointed out by Sahal. We show for the first
time that these regularities are observed in data to such a degree that the
performance of these two laws is nearly tied. Our results show that
technological progress is forecastable, with the square root of the logarithmic
error growing linearly with the forecasting horizon at a typical rate of 2.5%
per year. These results have implications for theories of technological change,
and assessments of candidate technologies and policies for climate change
mitigation.

standard perturbation theory, while at smaller scales they are suppresed due to
nonlinear couplings. Through extensive testing with numerical simulations we
find that this decay is characterized by the same damping scale for both two
and three-point propagators. In turn this transition can be well modeled with
resummation results that exponentiate one-loop computations. For the first

energy of about 130 GeV have been recently presented. While dark matter
annihilations are a viable candidate for this signal, it is generally expected
that such a flux would be correlated to a gamma-ray component with continuum
energy spectrum due to dark matter pair annihilating into other Standard Model
particles. We use the gamma-ray data from the inner 10 x 10 degree window to
derive limits for a variety of DM annihilation final states. Extending the
window of observation, we discuss bounds on the morphological shape of a dark
matter signal associated to the line, applying both standard templates for the
dark matter profile, such as an Einasto or a NFW profile, and introducing a new
more general parametrization.

several key features in cognitive radio (CR) networks including improved
spatio-temporal sensing, intelligent location-aware routing, as well as aiding
spectrum policy enforcement. In this paper we consider the achievable accuracy
of PU localization algorithms that jointly utilize received-signal-strength
(RSS) and direction-of-arrival (DoA) measurements by evaluating the Cramer-Rao
Bound (CRB). Previous works evaluate the CRB for RSS-only and DoA-only
localization algorithms separately and assume DoA estimation error variance is
a fixed constant or rather independent of RSS. We derive the CRB for joint
RSS/DoA-based PU localization algorithms based on the mathematical model of DoA
estimation error variance as a function of RSS, for a given CR placement. The
bound is compared with practical localization algorithms and the impact of
several key parameters, such as number of nodes, number of antennas and
samples, channel shadowing variance and correlation distance, on the achievable
accuracy are thoroughly analyzed and discussed. We also derive the closed-form
asymptotic CRB for uniform random CR placement, and perform theoretical and
numerical studies on the required number of CRs such that the asymptotic CRB
tightly approximates the numerical integration of the CRB for a given
placement.

is well-explained by a macroevolutionary tradeoff between short-term selective
advantages and long-term extinction risks from increased species body size,
unfolding above the 2g minimum size induced by thermoregulation in air. Here,
we consider whether this same tradeoff, formalized as a constrained
convection-reaction-diffusion system, can also explain the sizes of fully
aquatic mammals, which have not previously been considered. By replacing the
terrestrial minimum with a pelagic one, at roughly 7000g, the terrestrial
mammal tradeoff model accurately predicts, with no tunable parameters, the
observed body masses of all extant cetacean species, including the 175,000,000g
Blue Whale. This strong agreement between theory and data suggests that a
universal macroevolutionary tradeoff governs body size evolution for all
mammals, regardless of their habitat. The dramatic sizes of cetaceans can thus
be attributed mainly to the increased convective heat loss is water, which
shifts the species size distribution upward and pushes its right tail into
ranges inaccessible to terrestrial mammals. Under this macroevolutionary
tradeoff, the largest expected species occurs where the rate at which
smaller-bodied species move up into large-bodied niches approximately equals
the rate at which extinction removes them.

maps that play important roles in quantum information theory. The cones of
positive semidefinite matrices and completely positive linear maps, which
represent quantum states and quantum channels respectively, are the most
ubiquitous positive cones. There are also many natural cones that can been
regarded as ""more"" or ""less"" positive than these standard examples. In
particular, entanglement theory deals with the cones of separable operators and
entanglement witnesses, which satisfy very strong and weak positivity
properties respectively.
  Rather complementary to the various cones that arise in entanglement theory
are norms. The trace and operator norms for operators and the diamond and
completely bounded norms for superoperators are the typical norms that are seen
throughout quantum information theory. In this work our main goal is to develop
a family of norms that play a role analogous to the cone of entanglement
witnesses. We investigate the basic mathematical properties of these norms,
including their relationships with other well-known norms, their isometry
groups, and their dual norms. We also make the place of these norms in
entanglement theory rigorous by showing that entanglement witnesses arise from
minimal operator systems, and analogously our norms arise from minimal operator
spaces.
  Finally, we connect the various cones and norms considered here to several
seemingly unrelated problems from other areas. We characterize the problem of
whether or not non-positive partial transpose bound entangled states exist in
terms of one of our norms, and provide evidence in favour of their existence.
We also characterize the minimum gate fidelity of a quantum channel, the
maximum output purity and its completely bounded counterpart, and the geometric
measure of entanglement in terms of these norms.

Our model for the evolution of the NS spin is taken from an analysis of pulsar
timing noise presented by Hobbs et al. (2010). We first test the standard model
of a pulsar's magnetosphere in which B does not change with time and magnetic
dipole radiation is assumed to dominate the pulsar's spin-down. We find this
model fails to predict both the magnitudes and signs of the second derivatives
of the spin frequencies ($\ddot{\nu}$). We then construct a phenomenological
model of the evolution of $B$, which contains a long term decay (LTD) modulated
by short term oscillations (STO); a pulsar's spin is thus modified by its
B-evolution. We find that an exponential LTD is not favored by the observed
statistical properties of $\ddot{\nu}$ for young pulsars and fails to explain
the fact that $\ddot{\nu}$ is negative for roughly half of the old pulsars. A
simple power-law LTD can explain all the observed statistical properties of
$\ddot{\nu}$. Finally we discuss some physical implications of our results to
models of the B-decay of NSs and suggest reliable determination of the true
ages of many young NSs is needed, in order to constrain further the physical
mechanisms of their B-decay. Our model can be further tested with the measured
evolutions of $\dot{\nu}$ and $\ddot{\nu}$ for an individual pulsar; the decay
index, oscillation amplitude and period can also be determined this way for the
pulsar.

considered the ultimate purpose of colonising other worlds. Having examined the
possible motivations arising from improved scientific knowledge and access to
extraterrestrial raw materials, he concludes that the ultimate benefits of
space colonisation will be the increased opportunities for developing human
(and post-human) diversity, intellectual and aesthetic potential and,
especially, 'spirituality'. By the latter concept he meant a striving for
""sensitive and intelligent awareness of things in the universe (including
persons), and of the universe as a whole."" A key insight articulated by
Stapledon in this lecture was that this should be the aspiration of all human
development anyway, with or without space colonisation, but that the latter
would greatly increase the scope for such developments. Another key aspect of
his vision was the development of a diverse, but connected, 'Commonwealth of
Worlds' extending throughout the Solar System, and eventually beyond, within
which human potential would be maximised. In this paper I analyse Stapledon's
vision of space colonisation, and will conclude that his overall conclusions
remain sound. However, I will also argue that he was overly utopian in
believing that human social and political unity are prerequisites for space
exploration (while agreeing that they are desirable objectives in their own
right), and that he unnecessarily downplayed the more prosaic scientific and
economic motivations which are likely to be key drivers for space exploration
(if not colonisation) in the shorter term. Finally, I draw attention to some
recent developments in international space policy which, although probably not
influenced by Stapledon's work, are nevertheless congruent with his overarching
philosophy as outlined in 'Interplanetary Man?'

relativity, the energy conditions play an important role in the understanding
of several properties of the Universe, including singularity theorems, the
current accelerating expansion phase, and the possible existence of the
so-called phantom fields. Recently, the $f(T)$ gravity has been invoked as an
alternative approach for explaining the observed acceleration expansion of the
Universe. If gravity is described by a $f(T)$ theory instead of general
relativity, there are a number of issues that ought to be reexamined in the
framework of $f(T)$ theories. In this work, to proceed further with the current
investigation of the limits and potentialities of the $f(T)$ gravity theories,
we derive and discuss the bounds imposed by the energy conditions on a general
$f(T)$ functional form. The null and strong energy conditions in the framework
of $f(T)$ gravity are derived from first principles, namely the purely
geometric Raychaudhuri's equation along with the requirement that gravity is
attractive. The weak and dominant energy conditions are then obtained in a
direct approach via an effective energy-momentum tensor for $f(T)$ gravity.
Although similar, the energy condition inequalities are different from those of
general relativity (GR), but in the limit $f(T)=T$ the standard forms for the
energy conditions in GR are recovered. As a concrete application of the derived
energy conditions to locally homogeneous and isotropic $f(T)$ cosmology, we use
the recent estimated value of the Hubble parameter to set bounds from the weak
energy condition on the parameters of two specific families of $f(T)$ gravity
theories.

enigmatic lamellar cuprates the ground state evolves from an insulator into a

the peculiar metallic state at intermediate hole-carrier concentrations (p).
The planar resistivity of this unconventional metal exhibits a linear
temperature dependence (\rho $\propto$ T) that is disrupted upon cooling toward
the superconducting state by the opening of a partial gap (the pseudogap) on
the Fermi surface. Here we first demonstrate for the quintessential compound
HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ a dramatic switch from linear to purely quadratic

models can now be benchmarked against this remarkably simple universal
behavior. Deviations from this underlying behavior can be expected to lead to
new insights into the non-universal features exhibited by certain compounds.

to high-luminosity Herbig Be stars, exhibit a near-infrared (NIR) excess in
their spectra that is dominated by a bump in the monochromatic luminosity with
a peak near 3 microns. The bump can be approximated by a thermal emission
component of temperature 1500 K that is of the order of the sublimation
temperature of interstellar dust grains. In the currently popular ""puffed up
rim"" scenario, the bump represents stellar radiation that propagates through
the optically thin inner region of the surrounding accretion disk and is
absorbed and reemitted by the dust that resides just beyond the dust
sublimation radius, Rsub. However, this model cannot account for the strongest
bumps measured in these sources, and it predicts a large secondary bounce in
the interferometric visibility curve that is not observed. In this paper we
present an alternative interpretation, which attributes the bump to reemission
of stellar radiation by dust that is uplifted from the disk by a centrifugally
driven wind. Winds of this type are a leading candidate for the origin of the
strong outflows associated with protostars, and there is observational evidence
for disk winds originating on scales ~Rsub. Using a newly constructed Monte
Carlo radiative transfer code, we show that this model can account for the NIR
excess emission even in bright Herbig Ae stars such as AB Auriga and MWC 275,
and that it successfully reproduces the basic features of the visibilities
measured in these protostars. We argue that a robust dusty outflow in these
sources could be self-limiting to a relatively narrow launching region between
Rsub and 2Rsub. Finally, we suggest that our model could also naturally account
for the NIR and scattered-light variability exhibited by a source like MWC 275,
which may be triggered by the uplifting of dust clouds from the disk.

model singlet neutrinos gain Majorana masses of order TeV. In addition, we
introduce a flavor symmetry on the singlet neutrinos at a scale higher than
TeV. The flavor symmetry is explicitly broken by the neutrino Dirac Yukawa
coupling, which induces splittings in the singlet neutrino Majorana masses at
lower scales through renormalization group evolutions. We call this setup
""minimal flavor violation"". The mass-splittings are proportional to the tiny
Dirac Yukawa coupling, and hence they automatically enhance the CP asymmetry
parameter necessary for the resonant leptogenesis mechanism. In this paper, we
calculate the baryon number yield by solving the Boltzmann equations, including
the effects of $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson that also has TeV scale mass and causes
washing-out of the singlet neutrinos in the course of thermal leptogenesis. The
Dirac Yukawa coupling for neutrinos is fixed in terms of neutrino oscillation
data and an arbitrary $3 \times 3$ complex-valued orthogonal matrix. We show
that the right amount of baryon number asymmetry can be achieved through
thermal leptogenesis in the context of the minimal flavor violation with

invariant theory of compact Lie groups acting on complex vector spaces. This is
the starting point for the study of relative invariants and the computation of

construct a Hilbert basis of the ring of G-invariants from a Hilbert basis of

Reynolds operators defined on H-invariants is shown to be an essential tool to
obtain the invariants under the whole group. The theory is illustrated with

suggested as $\bar{D}(\lambda) = O(\sqrt{\min (n^{1+\alpha} \lambda, n^2)})$,
where L\'evy flight is a random walk of a power-law flight distribution with an
exponent $\alpha \in (0,2]$. The same framework presents a new tighter tradeoff

catalog, we selected 15 quasar candidates with 22 < i' < 24 at z~5, that are ~
3 mag fainter than the SDSS quasars in the same redshift range. We obtained
optical spectra for 14 of the 15 candidates using FOCAS on the Subaru Telescope
and did not identify any low-luminosity type-1 quasars at z~5 while a
low-luminosity type-2 quasar at z~5.07 was discovered. In order to constrain
the faint end of the quasar luminosity function at z~5, we calculated the
1sigma confidence upper limits of the space density of type-1 quasars. As a
result, the 1sigma confidence upper limits on the quasar space density are Phi<
1.33*10^{-7} Mpc^{-3} mag^{-1} for -24.52 < M_{1450} < -23.52 and Phi<
2.88*10^{-7} Mpc^{-3} mag^{-1} for -23.52 < M_{1450} < -22.52. The inferred
1sigma confidence upper limits of the space density are then used to provide
constrains on the faint-end slope and the break absolute magnitude of the
quasar luminosity function at z~5. We find that the quasar space density
decreases gradually as a function of redshift at low luminosity (M_{1450} ~
-23), being similar to the trend found for quasars with high luminosity
(M_{1450}<-26). This result is consistent with the so-called downsizing

studied with the metrics of interest being the received SNR loss and mutual
information loss, both relative to a perfect channel state information (CSI)
benchmark. The simplest case of unskewed codebooks is studied in the correlated
MIMO setting and these loss metrics are computed as a function of the number of
bits of feedback ($B$), transmit antenna dimension ($N_t$), and spatial
correlation. In particular, it is established that: i) the loss metrics are a
product of two components -- a quantization component and a channel-dependent
component; ii) the quantization component, which is also common to analysis of
channels with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) fading, decays
as $B$ increases at the rate $2^{-B/(N_t-1)}$; iii) the channel-dependent
component reflects the condition number of the channel. Further, the precise
connection between the received SNR loss and the squared singular values of the
channel is shown to be a Schur-convex majorization relationship. Finally, the
ensemble properties of skewed codebooks that are generated by skewing RVQ
codebooks with an appropriately designed fixed skewing matrix are studied.
Based on an estimate of the loss expression for skewed codebooks, it is
established that the optimal skewing matrix is critically dependent on the
condition numbers of the effective channel (product of the true channel and the
skewing matrix) and the skewing matrix.

wideband systems, denoted as the PNSC(alpha) Interference Model. It allows one
to obtain, analytic representations in situations where (a) interferers are
distributed according to either a homogeneous or an inhomogeneous in time or
space Cox point process and (b) when the frequency bands occupied by each of
the unknown number of interferers is also a random variable in the allowable
bandwidth. The analytic representations obtained are generalizations of Cox
processes to the family of sub-exponential models characterized by
distributions from the alpha-stable family. We develop general parametric
density representations for the interference models via doubly stochastic
Poisson mixture representations of Scaled Mixture of Normal's via the
Normal-Stable variance mixture. To illustrate members of this class of
interference model we also develop two special cases for a moderately impulsive
interference (alpha=3/2) and a highly impulsive interference (alpha=2/3) where
closed form representations can be obtained either by the SMiN representation
or via function expansions based on the Holtsmark distribution or Whittaker
functions. To illustrate the paper we propose expressions for the Capacity of a
BPSK system under a PNSC(alpha) interference, via analytic expressions for the

processing. Lithium is easily destroyed by proton capture in stellar
environments, so its abundance may be crucial to discriminate among different
models proposed to account for multiple populations. In order to reproduce the
observed O-Na anticorrelation and other patterns typical of multiple
populations, the formation of second generation stars must occur from the
nuclearly processed stellar ejecta, responsible of the chemical anomalies,
diluted with pristine gas having the composition of first generation stars. The
lithium abundance in the unprocessed gas -which is very likely to be equal to
the lithium abundance emerging from the Big Bang- affects the lithium chemical
patterns among the cluster stars. This paper focuses on a scenario in which
processed gas is provided by asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. We examine
the predictions of this scenario for the lithium abundances of multiple
populations. We study the role of the non-negligible lithium abundance in the
ejecta of massive AGB (A(Li)~2), and, at the same time, we explore how our
models can constrain the extremely large ---and very model dependent--- lithium
yields predicted by recent super--AGB models. We show that the super--AGB
yields may be tested by examining the lithium abundances in a large set of blue
main sequence stars in wCen and/or NGC2808. In addition, we examine the
different model results obtained by assuming for the pristine gas either the
Big Bang abundance predicted by the standard models (A(Li)=2.6-2.7), or the
abundance detected at the surface of population II stars (A(Li)=2.2-2.3). Once
a chemical model is well constrained, the O--Li distribution could perhaps be
used to shed light on the primordial lithium abundance.

proposes a rigorous approach to tackle the issue of navigation frame rotation

formulae set a well-founded cornerstone for the velocity/position algorithms
design that makes the comprehension of the inertial navigation computation
principle more accessible to practitioners, and different approximations to the

algorithms. Two-sample velocity and position algorithms are derived to
exemplify the design process. In the context of level-flight airplane examples,
the derived algorithm is analytically and numerically compared to the typical

that in SU(6) symmetry. In SU(6) symmetry, all octet baryons appear in the
density region below $\sim 1.2$ fm$^{-3}$, while, in the ESC08 model, only the
\Xi^- hyperon is produced. Furthermore, the medium modification of the internal
baryon structure hardens the equation of state for the core matter. Taking all
these effects into account, we can obtain the maximum neutron-star mass which
is consistent with the recently observed mass, 1.97 \pm 0.04 M_\sun (PSR
J1614-2230). We therefore conclude that the extension from SU(6) symmetry to
SU(3) symmetry in the meson-baryon couplings and the internal baryon-structure
variation in matter certainly enhance the mass of neutron star. Furthermore,
the effects of the form factor at vertex and the Fock contribution including
the tensor coupling due to the vector mesons are indispensable to describe the
core matter. In particular, the Fock term is very vital in reproducing the
preferable value of symmetry energy, a_4 (\simeq 30 - 40 MeV), in nuclear
matter.

of extragalactic supernovae that has remained detectable at radio and optical

detection of SN1957D in X-rays, as part of a 729 ks observation of M83 with
\chandra. The X-ray luminosity (0.3 - 8 keV) is 1.7 (+2.4,-0.3) 10**37 ergs/s.
The spectrum is hard and highly self-absorbed compared to most sources in M83
and to other young supernova remnants, suggesting that the system is dominated
at X-ray wavelengths by an energetic pulsar and its pulsar wind nebula. The
high column density may be due to absorption within the SN ejecta. HST WFC3
images resolve the supernova remnant from the surrounding emission and the
local star field. Photometry of stars around SN1957D, using WFC3 images,
indicates an age of less than 10**7 years and a main sequence turnoff mass more
than 17 solar masses. New spectra obtained with Gemini-South show that the
optical spectrum continues to be dominated by broad [O III] emission lines, the
signature of fast-moving SN ejecta. The width of the broad lines has remained
about 2700 km/s (FWHM). The [O III] flux dropped precipitously between 1989 and
1991, but continued monitoring shows the flux has been almost constant since.
In contrast, radio observations over the period 1990-2011 show a decline rate
inf the flux proportional to t**-4, far steeper than the rate observed earlier,
suggesting that the primary shock has overrun the edge of a pre-SN wind.

Many of these are located out of the Galactic plane and therefore may have
extragalactic origin. Here we assume that the formation of massive black holes
in galactic nuclei proceeds through a quasi-star stage and consider the
possibility of jet production by such objects. Those jets would be the sources
of collimated synchrotron and Compton emission, extending from radio to gamma
rays. The expected lifetimes of quasi-stars are of the order of million of
years while the jet luminosities, somewhat smaller than that of quasar jets,
are sufficient to account for the unidentified gamma-ray sources. The jet
emission dominates over the thermal emission of a quasi-star in all energy
bands, except when the jet is not directed towards an observer. The predicted
synchrotron emission peaks in the IR band, with the flux close to the limits of
the available IR all sky surveys. The ratio of the $\gamma$-ray flux to the IR
flux is found to be very large ($\sim 60$), much larger than in BL Lac objects
but reached by some radio-loud quasars. On the other hand, radio-loud quasars
show broad emission lines while no such lines are expected from quasi-stars.
Therefore the differentiation between various scenarios accounting for the
unidentified gamma-ray sources will be possible at the basis of the photometry
and spectroscopy of the IR/optical counterparts.

realising quantum oscillators with unprecedentedly high quality factors. We
investigate the dynamics of this system, especially in the so-called
self-trapping regimes, where one or more optical fields simultaneously trap and
cool the mechanical oscillator. The determining characteristic of this regime
is that both the mechanical frequency $\omega_M$ and single-photon
optomechanical coupling strength parameters $g$ are a function of the optical
field intensities, in contrast to usual set-ups where $\omega_M$ and $g$ are
constant for the given system. We also measure the characteristic transverse
and axial trapping frequencies of different sized silica nanospheres in a
simple optical standing wave potential, for spheres of radii $r=20-500$\,nm,
illustrating a protocol for loading single nanospheres into a standing wave
optical trap that would be formed by an optical cavity. We use this data to
confirm the dependence of the effective optomechanical coupling strength on
sphere radius for levitated nanospheres in an optical cavity and discuss the
prospects for reaching regimes of strong light-matter coupling. Theoretical
semiclassical and quantum displacement noise spectra show that for larger
nanospheres with $r \gtrsim 100$\,nm a range of interesting and novel dynamical
regimes can be accessed. These include simultaneous hybridization of the two
optical modes with the mechanical modes and parameter regimes where the system

~ 0.2 -- 1.0, and are distributed over a large sky area and involve a wide
range of stellar parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity and
metallicity), confirming that the carriers of DIBs are ubiquitous in the
diffuse interstellar medium (ISM). The sample is used to investigate relations
between strengths of DIBs and magnitudes of line-of-sight extinction, yielding
results (i.e., EW(5780)= 0.61 x E(B-V) and EW(6283) = 1.26 x E(B-V)) consistent

scales of a few hundred Mpc (out to z ~ 0.1), could produce the apparent
acceleration of the expansion of the universe observed via type Ia supernovae.
Several studies of galaxy counts in the near-infrared (NIR) have found that the
local universe appears under-dense by ~25-50% compared with regions a few
hundred Mpc distant. Galaxy counts at low redshifts sample primarily L ~ L*
galaxies. Thus, if the local universe is under-dense, then the normalization of
the NIR galaxy luminosity function (LF) at z>0.1 should be higher than that
measured for z<0.1. Here we present a highly complete (> 90%) spectroscopic
sample of 1436 galaxies selected in the H-band to study the normalization of
the NIR LF at 0.1<z<0.3 and address the question of whether or not we reside in
a large local underdensity. We find that for the combination of our six fields,
the product phi* L* at 0.1 < z < 0.3 is ~ 30% higher than that measured at
lower redshifts. While our statistical errors in this measurement are on the
~10% level, we find the systematics due to cosmic variance may be larger still.
We investigate the effects of cosmic variance on our measurement using the
COSMOS cone mock catalogs from the Millennium simulation and recent empirical
estimates. We find that our survey is subject to systematic uncertainties due
to cosmic variance at the 15% level ($1 sigma), representing an improvement by
a factor of ~ 2 over previous studies in this redshift range. We conclude that
observations cannot yet rule out the possibility that the local universe is
under-dense at z<0.1.

  ""Flux Rope Structure of CMEs""",,"10.1007/s11207-012-0084-8",,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We intend to provide a comprehensive answer to the question on whether all
Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) have flux rope structure. To achieve this, we
present a synthesis of the LASCO CME observations over the last sixteen years,
assisted by 3D MHD simulations of the breakout model, EUV and coronagraphic
observations from STEREO and SDO, and statistics from a revised LASCO CME
database. We argue that the bright loop often seen as the CME leading edge is
the result of pileup at the boundary of the erupting flux rope irrespective of
whether a cavity or, more generally, a 3-part CME can be identified. Based on
our previous work on white light shock detection and supported by the MHD
simulations, we identify a new type of morphology, the `two-front' morphology.
It consists of a faint front followed by diffuse emission and the bright
loop-like CME leading edge. We show that the faint front is caused by density
compression at a wave (or possibly shock) front driven by the CME. We also
present high-detailed multi-wavelength EUV observations that clarify the
relative positioning of the prominence at the bottom of a coronal cavity with
clear flux rope structure. Finally, we visually check the full LASCO CME
database for flux rope structures. In the process, we classify the events into
two clear flux rope classes (`3-part', `Loop'), jets and outflows (no clear
structure). We find that at least 40% of the observed CMEs have clear flux rope
structures. We propose a new definition for flux rope CMEs (FR-CMEs) as a
coherent magnetic, twist-carrying coronal structure with angular width of at
least 40 deg and able to reach beyond 10 Rsun which erupts on a time scale of a

shocks were studied only in-situ when they crossed over spacecraft or remotely
through their radio emission spectra. Neither of these two methods provides

its driver, the CME. In the last decade, we have been able to not only image
shocks with coronagraphs but also measure their properties remotely through the

gas-phase condensation of MgS occurs at a low efficiency. Precipitation of MgS

that the assumption of homogeneous MgS grains may not be correct. Using a Monte

this modeling is insensitive to the unknown MgS optical properties at \lambda <

used in this article is based on the introduction of random coefficients in the
usual linear SSE. A major interest is that this allows to develop a consistent
theory of quantum measurement in continuous time for these non-Markovian
quantum trajectory models. In this context, the notions of instrument, a priori
and a posteriori states are rigorously described. The key point is that by
starting from a stochastic equation on the Hilbert space of the system, we are
able to respect the complete positivity of the mean dynamics for the
statistical operator and the requirements of the axioms of quantum measurement
theory. The flexibility of the theory is next illustrated by a concrete
physical model of a noisy oscillator where non Markovian effects come from
random environment, coloured noises, randomness in the stimulating light, delay
effects. The statistics of the emitted photons and the heterodyne and homodyne
spectra are studied and we show how these quantities are sensible to the
non-Markovian features of the system dynamics, so that, in principle, the
observation and analysis of the fluorescence light could reveal the presence of
non-Markovian effects and allow for a measure of the spectra of the noises
affecting the system dynamics.

publications, - and their impact through citations? Whence, on one hand, this
paper very briefly examines bibliometric laws, like the $h$-index and
subsequent debate about co-authorship effects, but on the other hand, proposes
a measure of collaborative work through a new index. Based on data about the
publication output of a specific research group, a new bibliometric law is
found.
  Let a co-author $C$ have written $J$ (joint) publications with one or several
colleagues. Rank all the co-authors of that individual according to their
number of joint publications, giving a rank $r$ to each co-author, starting
with $r=1$ for the most prolific.
  It is empirically found that a very simple relationship holds between the
number of joint publications $J$ by coauthors and their rank of importance,
i.e. $J \propto 1/r$. Thereafter, in the same spirit as for the Hirsch core,
one can define a ""co-author core"", and introduce indices operating on an
author. It is emphasized that the new index has a quite different
(philosophical) perspective that the $h$-index. In the present case, one
focusses on ""relevant"" persons rather than on ""relevant"" publications.
  Although the numerical discussion is based on one case, there is little doubt
that the law can be verified in many other situations. Therefore, variants and
generalizations could be later produced in order to quantify co-author roles,
in a temporary or long lasting stable team(s), and lead to criteria about
funding, career measurements or even induce career strategies.

the long time diffusion is always normal. This process is found to be enhanced
for the case that we immobilize the grafted chains, i.e. the sub-diffusive
behavior sets in at an earlier time and spans over a longer time period before
becoming diffusive. Even if the grafted chains are replaced with a frozen sea
of repulsive, non-connected particles in the background, the transient
subdiffusion is observed. The intermediate subdiffusive behavior only
disappears when the grafted chains are replaced with a mobile background sea of
mutually repulsive particles. Overall, the long time diffusion coefficient of
the tracer along the cylinder axis decreases with the increase in system volume
fraction, strength of attraction between the tracer and the background and also
on freezing the background. We believe that the simple model presented here

interactions produced strongly textured mesophases with the cylindrical

selective melting does not play a role in mesophase alignment during isothermal

large scale grain rotation whereas alignment during cooling from the disordered
melt is rapid and driven by the nucleation of weakly ordered but preferentially
aligned material. We identify an optimum sub-cooling that maximizes alignment
during isothermal field annealing. This is corroborated by a simple model
incorporating the competing effects of an exponentially decreasing mobility and
divergent, increasing magnetic anisotropy on cooling below $T_{ODT}$. The
absence of measurable field-effects on $T_{ODT}$ is consistent with rough
estimates derived from the relative magnitudes of the free energy due to field

the University of Durham Mark VI gamma-ray Cherenkov telescope in Australia
with a flux corresponding to 20% of the Crab Nebula flux. It was later observed
and detected with high significance by the Southern Cherenkov observatory
H.E.S.S. Detection from the Northern hemisphere is difficult due to challenging
observation conditions under large zenith angles. In July 2006, the H.E.S.S.
collaboration reported an extraordinary outburst of VHE gamma-emission. During
the outburst, the VHE gamma-ray emission was found to be variable on the time
scales of minutes and with a mean flux of ~7 times the flux observed from the
Crab Nebula. Follow-up observations with the MAGIC-I standalone Cherenkov
telescope were triggered by this extraordinary outburst and PKS 2155-304 was
observed between 28 July to 2 August 2006 for 15 hours at large zenith angles.
Here we present our studies on the behavior of the source after its
extraordinary flare and an enhanced analysis method for data taken at high
zenith angles. We developed improved methods for event selection that led to a
better background suppression. The averaged energy spectrum we derived has a
spectral index of -3.5 +/- 0.2 above 400GeV, which is in good agreement with
the spectral shape measured by H.E.S.S. during the major flare on MJD 53944.
Furthermore, we present the spectral energy distribution modeling of PKS
2155-304. With our observations we increased the duty cycle of the source
extending the light curve derived by H.E.S.S. after the outburst. Finally, we
find night-by-night variability with a maximal amplitude of a factor three to
four and an intranight variability in one of the nights (MJD 53945) with a
similar amplitude.

circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics with phonons. Besides coupling to a
microwave cavity, our superconducting transmon qubit interacts with a phonon
mode in a micromechanical resonator, thus representing an atom coupled to two
different cavities. We measure the phonon Stark shift, as well as the splitting
of the qubit spectral line into motional sidebands, which feature transitions
between the dressed electromechanical states. In the time domain, we observe
coherent conversion of qubit excitation to phonons as sideband Rabi
oscillations. This is a model system having potential for a quantum interface,
which may allow for storage of quantum information in long-lived phonon states,
coupling to optical photons, or for investigations of strongly coupled quantum
systems near the classical limit.

the tensor force on the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy within
phenomenological models. The tensor force active in the isosinglet
neutron-proton interaction channel leads to appreciable depletion/population of
nucleons below/above the Fermi surface in the single-nucleon momentum
distribution in cold symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). We found that as a
consequence of the high momentum tail in SNM the kinetic part of the symmetry
energy $E^{kin}_{sym}(\rho)$ is significantly below the well-known Fermi gas
model prediction of approximately $12.5 (\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$. With about 15%
nucleons in the high momentum tail as indicated by the recent experiments at
J-Lab by the CLAS Collaboration, the $E^{kin}_{sym}(\rho)$ is negligibly small.
It even becomes negative when more nucleons are in the high momentum tail in
SNM. These features have recently been confirmed by three independent studies
based on the state-of-the-art microscopic nuclear many-body theories. In
addition, we also estimate the second-order tensor force contribution to the
potential part of the symmetry energy. Implications of these findings in
extracting information about nuclear symmetry energy from nuclear reactions are
discussed briefly.

minimal for 11.25<log M_star<11.5. The number density profile of the satellites
appears to be shallower than of dark matter, with the scale radius typically 60
per cent larger than of dark matter. The orbital anisotropy around red hosts
exhibits a mild excess of radial motions, in agreement with the typical
anisotropy profiles found in cosmological simulations, whereas blue galaxies

signs of equilibration and to identify effective temperatures in the
non-equilibrium behavior of a number of macroscopic classical and quantum
systems in contact with thermal baths. Among the most relevant cases in which
the effective temperatures thus defined were shown to have a thermodynamic
meaning one finds the stationary dynamics of driven super-cooled liquids and

propose to study the possible emergence of thermal behavior long after the

thermalization within the Gibbs ensemble eventually occurs these parameters
should be constant and equal for all pairs of observables in ""partial"" or

system, i.e., the quantum Ising chain, in the stationary regime after a quench
of the transverse field. The lack of thermalization to a Gibbs ensemble becomes
apparent within this approach.

and ii) load balancing in content distribution networks, where one is
interested in determining the impact of content replication on performance.
These two problems admit a common abstraction: in both scenarios, performance
is characterized by the maximum weight of a generalization of a matching in a
bipartite graph, featuring node and edge capacities. Our main result is a law
of large numbers characterizing the asymptotic maximum weight matching in the
limit of large bipartite random graphs, when the graphs admit a local weak
limit that is a tree. This result specializes to the two application scenarios,
yielding new results in both contexts. In contrast with previous results, the
key novelty is the ability to handle edge capacities with arbitrary integer
values. An analysis of belief propagation algorithms (BP) with multivariate
belief vectors underlies the proof. In particular, we show convergence of the

Particularly interesting, even for current research in atomic and nuclear

in order to take directly into account, already in the trial wavefunction, the

notable calculations specialized to the study of the two-electron problem show
the introduction of the remarkable concept of an effective nuclear charge

an application of the perturbative method, where the atomic number Z was
treated effectively as a continuous variable, contributions to the ground state

and light spanners for general graphs. One of them is the greedy algorithm of
Alth$\ddot{o}$fer et al. \cite{ADDJS93}, analyzed by Chandra et al. in SoCG'92.
The greedy algorithm consructs, for every \emph{weighted} undirected $n$-vertex
$m$-edge graph $G = (V,E)$ and any integer $k \ge 1$, a $(2k-1)$-spanner with
$O(n^{1 + 1/k})$ edges and weight $O(k \cdot n^{(1+\eps)/k}) \cdot
\omega(MST(G))$, for any $\eps > 0$. The drawback of the greedy algorithm is
that it requires $O(m \cdot (n^{1 + 1/k} + n \cdot \log n))$ time. The other
algorithm is due to Awerbuch et al. \cite{ABP91}. It constructs $O(k)$-spanners
with $O(k \cdot n^{1 + 1/k} \cdot \Lambda)$ edges, weight $O(k^2 \cdot n^{1/k}
\cdot \Lambda) \cdot \omega(MST(G))$, within time $O(m \cdot k \cdot n^{1/k}
\cdot \Lambda)$, where $\Lambda$ is the logarithm of the aspect ratio of the
graph. The running time of both these algorithms is unsatisfactory. Moreover,
the usually faster algorithm of \cite{ABP91} pays for the speedup by
significantly increasing both the stretch, the sparsity, and the weight of the
resulting spanner.
  In this paper we devise an efficient algorithm for constructing sparse and
light spanners. Specifically, our algorithm constructs $((2k-1) \cdot
(1+\eps))$-spanners with $O(k \cdot n^{1 + 1/k})$ edges and weight $O(k \cdot
n^{1/k}) \cdot \omega(MST(G))$, where $\eps > 0$ is an arbitrarily small
constant. The running time of our algorithm is $O(k \cdot m + \min\{n \cdot
\log n,m \cdot \alpha(n)\})$. Moreover, by slightly increasing the running time
we can reduce the other parameters. These results address an open problem from
the ESA'04 paper by Roditty and Zwick \cite{RZ04}.

Gpc, which is for factor $\pi$ smaller than radius of a corresponding 3-sphere.
However the event horizon, defined as the arc length inside the shell, has the
size of 14.0 $\pm$ 0.2 Gpc, which is in agreement with the observable data. The

CMB. It predicts the correct value for the Hubble constant $H_0$ = 67.26 $\pm$

glassy polymers. The theory is based on an ansatz for the Helmholtz free energy
where both the deviatoric and the volumetric contributions to the free energy
are rate-dependent. The requirement that the free energy is fully rate
dependent arises from the need to model the full range of conditions between
those found in quasi-static applications to those common in high-rate shock
loading scenarios. Using a purely equilibrium equation of state is found to be
insufficient. The resulting model, called the Glassy Amorphous Polymer (GAP)
model, suitably captures the thermo-mechanical behavior of both equilibrium
properties, but also high-rate phenomena like the shock Hugoniot.
Polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) is used as a representative polymer because it is
one of the few polymers where sufficient experiments have been done to
determine many of the parameters required by the GAP model. An important part
of the GAP model is the Hierarchical Flow Stress (HFS) model, which is shown to
accurately represent the stress-strain behavior of PMMA over a broad range of
strain rates and temperatures. The HFS model replicates the details of stress
plateau, softening, and hardening behavior observed in glassy amorphous
polymers. The theory is not restricted to isothermal conditions. Analysis is
devoted to several issues associated with a non-equilibrium equation of state
(EOS). Because data is insufficient for the full determination of the model's
non-equilibrium EOS, several plausible conditions called the quasi-equilibrium
hypothesis are put forth to complete the model. Comparisons of experimental and
theoretical results over a wide-range of loading rates and conditions are
reported.

systems describing closed market societies in the presence of taxation and
redistribution. We focus in particular on three example models obtained in
correspondence to different parameter choices. We analyse the influence of the
various choices on the long time shape of the income distribution. Several
simulations suggest that behavioral heterogeneity among the individuals plays a
definite role in the formation of fat tails of the asymptotic stationary
distributions. This is in agreement with results found with different
approaches and techniques. We also show that an excellent fit for the
computational outputs of our models is provided by the k-generalized
distribution introduced by G. Kaniadakis (Physica A 296 (2001) 405-425).
