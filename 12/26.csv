used in high-dimensional applications, and there is a rich literature on
optimality properties under sparsity assumptions. In the Bayesian paradigm,
sparsity is routinely induced through two-component mixture priors having a
probability mass at zero, but such priors encounter daunting computational
problems in high dimensions. This has motivated an amazing variety of
continuous shrinkage priors, which can be expressed as global-local scale
mixtures of Gaussians, facilitating computation. In sharp contrast to the
corresponding frequentist literature, very little is known about the properties
of such priors. Focusing on a broad class of shrinkage priors, we provide
precise results on prior and posterior concentration. Interestingly, we
demonstrate that most commonly used shrinkage priors, including the Bayesian
Lasso, are suboptimal in high-dimensional settings. A new class of Dirichlet
Laplace (DL) priors are proposed, which are optimal and lead to efficient
posterior computation exploiting results from normalized random measure theory.
Finite sample performance of Dirichlet Laplace priors relative to alternatives
is assessed in simulations.

production of ionizing photons, then we use the semi-numerical method to model
the reionization process. Such an approach allows more detailed modeling of the
reionization, and also connects observations of galaxies at low and high
redshifts to the reionization history. The galaxy formation model we use was
designed to match the low-$z$ observations, and it also fits the high redshift
luminosity function reasonably well, but its prediction on the star formation
falls below the observed value, and we find that it also underpredicts the
stellar ionizing photon production rate, hence the reionization can not be
completed at $z \sim 6$ without taking into account some other potential
sources of ionization photons. We also considered simple modifications of the
model with more top heavy initial mass functions (IMF), with which the
reionization can occur at earlier epochs. The incorporation of the

measure. We present explicit and sharp criteria for the Poincar\'{e} inequality
and the super Poincar\'{e} inequality of the following non-local Dirichlet form
with finite range jump $$\mathscr{E}_{\alpha, V}(f,f):= (1/2)\iint_{{|x-y|\le

Poincar\'{e} inequality for $\mathscr{E}_{\alpha, V}$ and $\mathscr{D}_{\alpha,

the results about $\mathscr{E}_{\alpha, V}$ show that the probability measure
fulfilling Poincar\'{e} inequality and super Poincar\'{e} inequality for
non-local Dirichlet form with finite range jump and that for local Dirichlet
form enjoy some similar properties; on the other hand, the assertions for
$\mathscr{D}_{\alpha, V}$ indicate that even if functional inequalities for
non-local Dirichlet form heavily depend on the density of large jump in the
associated L\'{e}vy measure, the corresponding small jump plays an important
role for local super Poincar\'{e} inequality, which is inevitable to derive
super Poincar\'{e} inequality.

image and speech, into bit arrays and allows high-speed similarity calculation
with the Hamming distance. There is a hashing scheme that maps feature vectors
to bit arrays depending on the signs of the inner products between feature
vectors and the normal vectors of hyperplanes placed in the feature space. This
hashing can be seen as a discretization of the feature space by hyperplanes. If
labels for data are given, one can determine the hyperplanes by using learning
algorithms. However, many proposed learning methods do not consider the
hyperplanes' offsets. Not doing so decreases the number of partitioned regions,
and the correlation between Hamming distances and Euclidean distances becomes
small. In this paper, we propose a lift map that converts learning algorithms
without the offsets to the ones that take into account the offsets. With this
method, the learning methods without the offsets give the discretizations of

some of these scenarios featuring new physics at energy scales relevant for
Large Hadron Collider searches. A systematic approach to constructing a large
class of models for Majorana neutrinos may be founded upon a list of
gauge-invariant effective operators -- formed from quarks, leptons and the
Higgs doublet -- that violate lepton-number conservation by two units. By
opening up these operators in all possible ways consistent with some minimality
assumptions, a complete catalogue of a class of minimal radiative neutrino mass
models may be produced. In this paper we present an analysis of Feynman diagram
topologies relevant for the ultra-violet completions of these effective
operators and collect these into a simple recipe that can be used to generate
radiative neutrino mass models. Since high mass-dimension effective operators
are suppressed by powers of the scale of new physics, many of the resulting
models can be meaningfully tested at the Large Hadron Collider.

immobilization protocol, neither chemical nor mechanical, was needed. For the
first time, the native gliding movements of Gram-negative Nostoc cyanobacteria
upon the surface, at speeds up to 900microns/h, were studied by AFM. This was
possible thanks to an improved combination of a gentle sample preparation
process and an AFM procedure based on fast and complete force-distance curves
made at every pixel, drastically reducing lateral forces. No limitation in
spatial resolution or imaging rate was detected. Gram-positive and non-motile
Rhodococcus wratislaviensis bacteria were studied as well. From the approach
curves, Young modulus and turgor pressure were measured for both strains at
different gliding speeds and are ranging from 20 to 105MPa and 40 to 310kPa
depending on the bacterium and the gliding speed. For Nostoc, spatially limited
zones with higher values of stiffness were observed. The related spatial period
is much higher than the mean length of Nostoc nodules. This was explained by an
inhomogeneous mechanical activation of nodules in the Nostoc. We also observed
the presence of a soft extra cellular matrix (ECM) around the Nostoc bacterium.
Both strains left a track of polymeric slime with variable thicknesses. For
Rhodococcus, it is equal to few hundreds of nm, likely to promote its adhesion
to the sample. While gliding, the Nostoc secretes a slime layer the thickness
of which is in the nanometer range and increases with the gliding speed. These
results open a large window on new studies of both dynamical phenomena of
practical and fundamental interests such as the formation of biofilms and
dynamic properties of bacteria in real physiological conditions.

the electroproduction data properly. The numerical results for the $\phi$
distribution shows obvious different structures from that for the
photoproduction, due to the enhancement of the kaon exchange by the
longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon as expected. Numerically, we
observe that the kaon-exchange contribution in the $t$ channel becomes about a
half of that from the contact-term one that dominates the photoproduction of
$\Lambda^*$. We also provide theoretical estimations for the $\Lambda^*$
electroproduction off the neutron target, showing that its production rate is
saturated almost by the resonance contributions. Finally, the contact-term
dominance, which is the key ingredient for the $\Lambda^*$ electromagnetic
productions, is briefly discussed.

orbit of Neptune in a region known as the trans-Neptunian belt (or
Edgeworth-Kuiper belt). In contrast to the predictions of accretion models that
feature protoplanetary disk planetesimals evolving on dynamically cold orbits
(with both very small eccentricities, e, and inclinations, i), in reality TNOs
exhibit surprisingly wide ranges of orbital eccentricities and inclinations.
Several theoretical models have addressed the origin and orbital evolution of
the main dynamical classes of TNOs, but none have successfully reproduced them
all. In addition, none have explained several objects on peculiar orbits, or
provided insightful predictions, without which a model cannot be tested
properly against observations. Based on extensive simulations of planetesimal
disks with the presence of the four giant planets and huge numbers of modeled
planetesimals, I explore in detail the dynamics of the TNOs, in particular
their (un)stable regions over timescales comparable to the age of the solar
system, and the role of resonances across the entire trans-Neptunian region. I
also propose that, along with the orbital history of the giant planets, the
orbital evolution of primordial embryos (massive planetesimals comparable to
Mars-Earth masses) can explain the fine orbital structure of the
trans-Neptunian belt, the orbits of Jovian and Neptunian Trojans, and possibly
the current orbits of the giant planets. Those primordial embryos were
ultimately scattered by the giant planets, a process that stirred both the
orbits of the giant planets and the primordial planetesimal disk to the levels
observed at 40-50 AU. In particular, the main constraints provided by the
trans-Neptunian belt are optimally satisfied if at least one such primordial
embryo (planetoid) survived in the outskirts of the solar system.

slipping stripes. The spatially varying slip length, $b(y)$, is assumed to be
small compared to the scale of the heterogeneities, $L$, but finite. For such
""weakly"" slipping surfaces, earlier analyses have predicted that the effective
slip length is simply given by the surface-averaged slip length, which implies
that the effective slip-length tensor becomes isotropic. Here we show that a
different scenario is expected if the local slip length has step-like jumps at
the edges of slipping heterogeneities. In this case, the next-to-leading term
in an expansion of the effective slip-length tensor in powers of
${max}\,(b(y)/L)$ becomes comparable to the leading-order term, but
anisotropic, even at very small $b(y)/L$. This leads to an anisotropy of the
effective slip, and to its significant reduction compared to the
surface-averaged value. The asymptotic formulae are tested by numerical
solutions and are in agreement with results of dissipative particle dynamics
simulations.

studied using a direct numerical simulation method which simultaneously solves
for the host fluid and the swimming particles. A modified version of the
""Smoothed Profile"" method (SPM) is developed to simulate microswimmers as
squirmers, which are spherical particles with a specified surface-tangential
slip velocity between the particles and the fluid. This simplified swimming
model allows one to represent different types of propulsion (pullers and
pushers) and is thus ideal to study the hydrodynamic interactions among
swimmers. We use the SPM to study the diffusive behavior which arises due to
the swimming motion of the particles, and show that there are two basic
mechanisms responsible for this phenomena: the hydrodynamic interactions caused
by the squirming motion of the particles, and the particle-particle collisions.
This dual nature gives rise to two distinct time- and length- scales, and thus
to two diffusion coefficients, which we obtain by a suitable analysis of the
swimming motion. We show that the collisions between swimmers can be
interpreted in terms of binary collisions, in which the effective collision
radius is reduced due to the collision dynamics of swimming particles in
viscous fluids. At short time-scales, the dynamics of the swimmer is analogous
to that of an inert tracer particle in a swimming suspension, in which the
diffusive motion is caused by fluid-particle collisions. Our results, along
with the simulation method we have introduced, will allow us to gain a better
understanding of the complex hydrodynamic interactions of self-propelled

can be used to establish private information or implement quantum logical

spatially separated, opening the opportunity to create highly connected quantum
networks or extend quantum cryptography to long distances. Here we present a
key experiment towards the realization of long-distance quantum networks with
solid-state quantum registers. We have entangled two electron spin qubits in
diamond that are separated by a three-meter distance. We establish this

entanglement and a subsequent joint measurement of the photons. Detection of
the photons heralds the projection of the spin qubits onto an entangled state.
We verify the resulting non-local quantum correlations by performing
single-shot readout on the qubits in different bases. The long-distance
entanglement reported here can be combined with recently achieved

Our earlier MC analysis gives \lambda_{\perp}=1.955 \pm 0.020 and
\lambda_{\parallel} about 0.9 for the O(4) model. A recent MC estimation of
\lambda_{\parallel}, assuming corrections to scaling of the standard theory,
yields \lambda_{\parallel} = 0.69 \pm 0.10 for the O(2) model. Currently, we
have performed a similar MC estimation for the O(10) model, yielding
\lambda_{\perp} = 1.9723(90). We have observed that the plot of the effective
transverse exponent for the O(4) model is systematically shifted down with

However, it is not the solvation structure. It is just only a mean force

Model expectation is observed. Upper limits at 95% confidence level on fiducial
cross-sections for the production of new particles are extracted. Results are
interpreted in the context of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension

product of the hyperbolic upper half plane H and the homogeneous tree T with
degree p+1 > 2, the latter seen as a one-complex. Let h be the Busemann
function of T with respect to a fixed boundary point. Then for real q > 1 and
integer p > 1, treebolic space HT(q,p) consists of all pairs (z=x+i y,w) in H x
T with h(w) = log_{q} y. It can also be obtained by glueing together horziontal
strips of H in a tree-like fashion. We explain the geometry and metric of HT
and exhibit a locally compact group of isometries (a horocyclic product of
affine groups) that acts with compact quotient. When q=p, that group contains
the amenable Baumslag-Solitar group BS(p)$ as a co-compact lattice, while when
q and p are distinct, it is amenable, but non-unimodular. HT(q,p) is a key
example of a strip complex in the sense of our previous paper in Advances in
Mathematics 226 (2011) 992-1055.
  Relying on the analysis of strip complexes developed in that paper, we
consider a family of natural Laplacians with ""vertical drift"" and describe the
associated Brownian motion. The main difficulties come from the singularites
which treebolic space (as any strip complex) has along its bifurcation lines.
  In this first part, we obtain the rate of escape and a central limit theorem,
and describe how Brownian motion converges to the natural geometric boundary at
infinity. Forthcoming work will be dedicated to positive harmonic functions.

mature evolution phase, for example they do not seem to show strong dynamical
evolution at least up to z~0.5, their galaxy red sequence is already in place
at least up to z$\sim$1.2, and their diffuse light content remains stable up to
z~0.8. The question is now to know if cluster properties can evolve more
significantly at redshifts notably higher than 1. We propose here to see how
the properties of the intracluster light (ICL) evolve with redshift by
detecting and analysing the ICL in the X-ray cluster CL J1449+0856 at z=2.07
(discovered by Gobat et al. 2011), based on deep HST NICMOS H band exposures.We
used the same wavelet-based method as that applied to 10 clusters between z=0.4
and 0.8 by Guennou et al. (2012). We detect three diffuse light sources with
respective total magnitudes of H=24.8, 25.5, and 25.9, plus a more compact
object with a magnitude H=25.3. We discuss the significance of our detections
and show that they are robust. The three sources of diffuse light indicate an
elongation along a north-east south-west axis, similar to that of the
distribution of the central galaxies and to the X-ray elongation. This strongly
suggests a history of merging events along this direction. While Guennou et al.
(2012) found a roughly constant amount of diffuse light for clusters between
z~0 and 0.8, we put in evidence at least a 1.5 magnitude increase between z~0.8
and 2. If we assume that the amount of diffuse light is directly linked to the
infall activity on the cluster, this implies that CL J1449+0856 is still
undergoing strong merging events.

from hot gas ($kT\sim 0.79\kev$, $n_e\sim 10^{-3}{\rm cm^{-3}}$, $L_X \sim
5\times10^{42}{\rm erg s^{-1}}$ extended over $\sim 186{\rm kpc}$), and
unresolved nuclear emission exhibiting mild activity. The hot gaseous
environment of CTD 86 is similar to that found in groups of galaxies or in
bright early-type galaxies. No clear signatures of radio-lobe interaction with
the diffuse hot gas is evident in this case. X-ray emission from the nucleus is
well constrained by an intrinsically absorbed ($N_H \sim 5.9\times10^{22}{\rm
cm^{-2}}$) power law ($\Gamma \sim 1.5$) with $2-10\kev$ luminosity $L_X \sim
2.1\times10^{42}{\rm erg s^{-1}}$. We have measured the stellar velocity
dispersion, $\sigma=182\pm8\kms$, for the CTD 86 and estimated a mass
$M_{BH}\sim 9\times 10^7{\rm M_\odot}$ with $L_{bol}/L_{Edd} \sim
4\times10^{-3}$. The low $L_{bol}/L_{Edd}$ rate and high $L_X/L_{[O III]}$
ratio suggest that the central engine of CTD 86 consists of a truncated
accretion disk lacking a strong ionizing UV radiation and an inner hot flow
producing the X-ray emission. The truncated disk is likely to be inclined with
($i\sim40^\circ-50^\circ$) such that our line of sight passes through the outer
regions of a putative torus and thus results in high X-ray absorption. We have
also identified two bright X-ray sources, SDSS J142452.11+263715.1 and SDSS
J142443.78+263616.2, near CTD 86. SDSS J142452.11+263715.1 is a type 1 active
galactic nucleus at $z=0.3761$ and unabsorbed $0.3-10\kev$ X-ray luminosity
$L_X\sim 8 \times 10^{43}{\rm erg s^{-1}}$, while SDSS J142443.78+263616.2 is
probably a galaxy with an active nucleus.

network is visible to every {neighbor} of the path, i.e., every neighbor of
some node on the path, thus including the nodes on the path itself. The
exposure of a path $P$ can be measured as the number of nodes adjacent to it,
denoted by $N[P]$. A path is said to be secluded if its exposure is small. A
similar measure can be applied to other connected subgraphs, such as Steiner
trees connecting a given set of terminals. Such subgraphs may be relevant due
to considerations of privacy, security or revenue maximization. This paper
considers problems related to minimum exposure connectivity structures such as
paths and Steiner trees. It is shown that on unweighted undirected $n$-node
graphs, the problem of finding the minimum exposure path connecting a given
pair of vertices is strongly inapproximable, i.e., hard to approximate within a
factor of $O(2^{\log^{1-\epsilon}n})$ for any $\epsilon>0$ (under an
appropriate complexity assumption), but is approximable with ratio
$\sqrt{\Delta}+3$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree in the graph. One of
our main results concerns the class of bounded-degree graphs, which is shown to
exhibit the following interesting dichotomy. On the one hand, the minimum

affect the electro-magnetic field (antenna beams, ionosphere, Faraday rotation,
etc.). As shown earlier the A-Projection is a fast and accurate algorithm that
can potentially correct for any given DDE in the imaging step. With its very
wide field of view, low operating frequency ($\sim30-250$ MHz), long baselines,
and complex station-dependent beam patterns, the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is
certainly the most complex SKA precursor. In this paper we present a few
implementations of A-Projection applied to LOFAR that can deal with non-unitary
station beams and non-diagonal Mueller matrices. The algorithm is designed to
correct for all the DDE, including individual antenna, projection of the
dipoles on the sky, beam forming and ionospheric effects. We describe a few
important algorithmic optimizations related to LOFAR's architecture allowing us
to build a fast imager. Based on simulated datasets we show that A-Projection
can give dramatic dynamic range improvement for both phased array beams and

million objects; over 105 million of them with proper motions. UCAC4 is an
updated version of UCAC3 with about the same number of stars also covering
all-sky. Bugs were fixed, Schmidt plate survey data were avoided, and precise
5-band photometry were added. Astrograph observations have been supplemented
for bright stars by FK6, Hipparcos and Tycho-2 data to compile a UCAC4 star
catalog complete to about magnitude R = 16. Epoch 1998 to 2004 positions are
obtained from observations with the 20 cm aperture USNO Astrograph's red lens,
equipped with a 4k by 4k CCD. Mean positions and proper motions are derived by
combining these observations with over 140 ground- and space-based catalogs,
including Hipparcos/Tycho and the AC2000.2, as well as unpublished measures of
over 5000 plates from other astrographs. For most of the faint stars the first
epoch plates from the Southern Proper Motion (SPM) and the Northern Proper
Motion (NPM) programs form the basis for proper motions. These data are
supplemented by 2MASS near-IR photometry for about 110 million stars and 5-band
(B,V,g,r,i) APASS data for over 51 million stars. Thus the published UCAC4, as
were UCAC3 and UCAC2, is a compiled catalog with the UCAC observational program

epoch is about 15 to 100 mas per coordinate, depending on magnitude, while the
formal errors in proper motions range from about 1 to 10 mas/yr depending on

intended to numerically solve Euclidean conformal field theories that can be
realized as fixed points of known Lagrangians. As an example, we employ a
lattice shaped as a cylinder with a 2D Icosahedral cross-section to discretize
dilatations in the 3D Ising model. Using this method, we obtain the preliminary
estimate eta=0.034(10).

Finally, we prove that every topological insulator gives rise to an infinite

Our conclusions are confirmed by numerical simulations.

unstructured text is increasingly refined using semantic annotations and
structured knowledge bases. However, most users cannot become familiar with the
schema of knowledge bases and ask structured queries. Interpreting free-format
queries into a more structured representation is of much current interest. The
dominant paradigm is to segment or partition query tokens by purpose
(references to types, entities, attribute names, attribute values, relations)
and then launch the interpreted query on structured knowledge bases. Given that
structured knowledge extraction is never complete, here we use a data
representation that retains the unstructured text corpus, along with structured
annotations (mentions of entities and relationships) on it. We propose two new,
natural formulations for joint query interpretation and response ranking that
exploit bidirectional flow of information between the knowledge base and the
corpus.One, inspired by probabilistic language models, computes expected
response scores over the uncertainties of query interpretation. The other is
based on max-margin discriminative learning, with latent variables representing
those uncertainties. In the context of typed entity search, both formulations
bridge a considerable part of the accuracy gap between a generic query that
does not constrain the type at all, and the upper bound where the ""perfect""
target entity type of each query is provided by humans. Our formulations are
also superior to a two-stage approach of first choosing a target type using
recent query type prediction techniques, and then launching a type-restricted
entity search query.
