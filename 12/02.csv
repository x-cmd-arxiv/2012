at chemical freeze-out the resulting hadronic mass spectrum used in the hadron

such a property of hadronic mass spectrum at chemical freeze-out can be
explained by the two new effects found here for wide resonances existing in a
thermal environment: the near threshold thermal resonance enhancement and the
near threshold resonance sharpening. The effect of resonance sharpening is
studied for a sigma meson and our analysis shows that for the temperatures well
below 92 MeV the effective width of sigma meson is about 50 to 70 MeV. Thus,
the effect of resonance sharpening justifies the usage of the sigma-like
field-theoretical models for the strongly interacting matter equation of state
at such temperatures. Also we argue that the most optimistic hope to find the
quark gluon bags experimentally may be related to their sharpening and
enhancement in a thermal medium. In this case the wide quark gluon bags may
appear directly or in decays as narrow resonances that are absent in the tables
of elementary particles and that have the width about 50-150 MeV and the mass
about or above 2.5 GeV.

are cohesion and identity. The social cohesion approach posits that social
groups arise out of an aggregation of individuals that have mutual
interpersonal attraction as they share common characteristics. These
characteristics can range from common interests to kinship ties and from social
values to ethnic backgrounds. In contrast, the social identity approach posits
that an individual is likely to join a group based on an intrinsic
self-evaluation at a cognitive or perceptual level. In other words group
members typically share an awareness of a common category membership.
  In this work we seek to understand the role of these two contrasting theories
in explaining the behavior and stability of social communities in Twitter. A
specific focal point of our work is to understand the role of these theories in
disparate contexts ranging from disaster response to socio-political activism.
We extract social identity and social cohesion features-of-interest for large
scale datasets of five real-world events and examine the effectiveness of such
features in capturing behavioral characteristics and the stability of groups.
We also propose a novel measure of social group sustainability based on the
divergence in group discussion. Our main findings are: 1) Sharing of social
identities (especially physical location) among group members has a positive
impact on group sustainability, 2) Structural cohesion (represented by high
group density and low average shortest path length) is a strong indicator of
group sustainability, and 3) Event characteristics play a role in shaping group
sustainability, as social groups in transient events behave differently from
groups in events that last longer.

information in graph structures for the purpose of community discovery, a
fundamental task in network analysis. Our approach hinges on the basic
intuition that many networks contain noise in the link structure and that
content information can help strengthen the community signal. This enables ones
to eliminate the impact of noise (false positives and false negatives), which
is particularly prevalent in online social networks and Web-scale information
networks.
  Specifically we introduce a measure of signal strength between two nodes in
the network by fusing their link strength with content similarity. Link
strength is estimated based on whether the link is likely (with high
probability) to reside within a community. Content similarity is estimated
through cosine similarity or Jaccard coefficient. We discuss a simple mechanism
for fusing content and link similarity. We then present a biased edge sampling
procedure which retains edges that are locally relevant for each graph node.
The resulting backbone graph can be clustered using standard community
discovery algorithms such as Metis and Markov clustering.
  Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets (Flickr,
Wikipedia and CiteSeer) with varying sizes and characteristics, we demonstrate
the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods over state-of-the-art learning
and mining approaches several of which also attempt to combine link and content
analysis for the purposes of community discovery. Specifically we always find a
qualitative benefit when combining content with link analysis. Additionally our
biased graph sampling approach realizes a quantitative benefit in that it is
typically several orders of magnitude faster than competing approaches.

strength is an active area in mathematical logic. In this setting, called
reverse mathematics, one investigates which theorems provably imply which
others in a weak formal theory roughly corresponding to computable mathematics.
Since the proofs of such implications take place in classical logic, they may
in principle involve appeals to multiple applications of a particular theorem,
or to non-uniform decisions about how to proceed in a given construction. In
practice, however, if a theorem $\mathsf{Q}$ implies a theorem $\mathsf{P}$, it
is usually because there is a direct uniform translation of the problems
represented by $\mathsf{P}$ into the problems represented by $\mathsf{Q}$, in a
precise sense. We study this notion of uniform reducibility in the context of
several natural combinatorial problems, and compare and contrast it with the
traditional notion of implication in reverse mathematics. We show, for
instance, that for all $n,j,k \geq 1$, if $j < k$ then Ramsey's theorem for
$n$-tuples and $k$ many colors does not uniformly reduce to Ramsey's theorem
for $j$ many colors. The two theorems are classically equivalent, so our
analysis gives a genuinely finer metric by which to gauge the relative strength
of mathematical propositions. We also study Weak K\""{o}nig's Lemma, the Thin
Set Theorem, and the Rainbow Ramsey's Theorem, along with a number of their
variants investigated in the literature. Uniform reducibility turns out to be
connected with sequential forms of mathematical principles, where one wishes to
solve infinitely many instances of a particular problem simultaneously. We
exploit this connection to uncover new points of difference between
combinatorial problems previously thought to be more closely related.

users' profiles and 7.2 billion relations and a large data set of Twitter.
Firstly some basic features of Sina Weibo and Twitter are analyzed such as
degree and activeness distribution, correlation between degree and activeness,
and the degree of separation. Then the following preference is investigated by
studying the assortative mixing, friend similarities, following distribution,
edge balance ratio, and ranking correlation, where edge balance ratio is newly
proposed to measure balance property of graphs. It is found that Sina Weibo has
a lower reciprocity rate, more positive balanced relations and is more
disassortative. Coinciding with Asian traditional culture, the following
preference of Sina Weibo users is more concentrated and hierarchical: they are
more likely to follow people at higher or the same social levels and less
likely to follow people lower than themselves. In contrast, the same kind of
following preference is weaker in Twitter. Twitter users are open as they
follow people from levels, which accords with its global characteristic and the
prevalence of western civilization. The message forwarding behavior is studied
by displaying the propagation levels, delays, and critical users. The following
preference derives from not only the usage habits but also underlying reasons
such as personalities and social moralities that is worthy of future research.

the highest Curie temperature, has largely been described theoretically as a
half-metal. This conclusion, however, disagrees with Point Contact Andreev
Reflection (PCAR) spectroscopy measurements, which give much lower values of
spin polarization, P. Here, we present the spin polarization measurements of
Co2FeSi by the PCAR technique, along with a thorough computational exploration,
within the DFT and a GGA+U approach, of the Coulomb exchange U-parameters for
Co and Fe atoms, taking into account spin-orbit coupling. We find that the
orbital contribution (mo) to the total magnetic moment (mT) is significant,
since it is at least 3 times greater than the experimental uncertainty of mT.
Account of mo radically affects the acceptable values of U. Specifically, we
find no values of U that would simultaneously satisfy the experimental values
of the magnetic moment and result in the half-metallicity of Co2FeSi. On the
other hand, the ranges of U that we report as acceptable are compatible with
spin polarization measurements (ours and the ones found in the literature),
which all are within approximately 40-60% range. Thus, based on reconciling
experimental and computational results, we conclude that: a) spin-orbit
coupling cannot be neglected in calculating Co2FeSi magnetic properties, and b)
Co2FeSi Heusler alloy is not half-metallic. We believe that our approach can be
applied to other Heusler alloys such as Co2FeAl.

the mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution, or equivalently, the minimum

GaBP are known, but GaBP may fail to converge to the correct solution given an
arbitrary positive definite quadratic function. As was observed in previous
work, the GaBP algorithm fails to converge if the computation trees produced by
the algorithm are not positive definite. In this work, we will show that the
failure modes of the GaBP algorithm can be understood via graph covers, and we
prove that a parameterized generalization of the min-sum algorithm can be used
to ensure that the computation trees remain positive definite whenever the
input matrix is positive definite. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm
is closely related to other iterative schemes for quadratic minimization such

critical for designing protocols that route information efficiently and for
maintaining security, whether at the scale of an internet service provider or
within a corporation. While technically feasible, the direct measurement of
point-to-point traffic imposes a heavy burden on network performance and is
typically not implemented. Instead, indirect aggregate traffic volumes are
routinely collected. We consider the problem of estimating point-to-point
traffic volumes, x_t, from aggregate traffic volumes, y_t, given information
about the network routing protocol encoded in a matrix A. This estimation task
can be reformulated as finding the solutions to a sequence of ill-posed linear
inverse problems, y_t = A x_t, since the number of origin-destination routes of
interest is higher than the number of aggregate measurements available.
  Here, we introduce a novel multilevel state-space model of aggregate traffic
volumes with realistic features. We implement a naive strategy for estimating
unobserved point-to-point traffic volumes from indirect measurements of
aggregate traffic, based on particle filtering. We then develop a more
efficient two-stage inference strategy that relies on model-based
regularization: a simple model is used to calibrate regularization parameters
that lead to efficient and scalable inference in the multilevel state-space
model. We apply our methods to corporate and academic networks, where we show
that the proposed inference strategy outperforms existing approaches and scales
to larger networks. We also design a simulation study to explore the factors
that influence the performance. Our results suggest that model-based
regularization may be an efficient strategy for inference in other complex
multilevel models.

evidence of such volatility heterogeneity in blood pressure trajectories during
pregnancy, for example, and reason to suspect that volatility is a biologically

propose a novel class of FDA models characterized using hierarchical stochastic

correlation with the 2--10 keV absorption-corrected flux and that the power-law
component flux decayed faster than the blackbody component for the first ~100
days. We also measure the timing properties of the source by analyzing data
spanning approximately 2500 days. The measured period and period derivative are
10.610644(17) s (MJD 53999.06) and <4 X 10^{-13} s s^-1 (90% confidence) which
imply that the spin-inferred dipolar magnetic field of the source is less than

find evidence for a second flux increase, suggesting a second outburst between

GeV/c. An obvious medium modification impact can be seen from the signal shape
change and relative jet contribution in the above events, which shows different
behaviors between central and peripheral events, and among different
$p_{T}^{assoc}$ ranges in central events. More detailed $p_{T}^{assoc}$

insertion-only streams for $k\ge 3$. For any constant $c$ we show an
$O(n^{1-2/k}\log(n)\log^{(c)}(n))$ upper bound on the space complexity of the

presentation, we make the following assumptions: $n$ and $m$ are polynomially
far; approximation error $\epsilon$ and parameter $k$ are constants. We observe
a natural bijection between streams and special matrices. Our main technical
contribution is a non-uniform sampling method on matrices. We call our method a
\emph{pick-and-drop sampling}; it samples a heavy element (i.e., element $i$

result, we reduce the space complexity of finding a heavy element to

equation, J. Comp. Phys., (2013), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2012.10.058).
The key idea, on which the method relies, is to solve the collision part on a
grid and then to solve exactly the transport part by following the
characteristics backward in time. On the contrary to classical semi-Lagrangian
methods one does not need to reconstruct the distribution function at each time
step. This allows to tremendously reduce the computational cost and to perform
efficient numerical simulations of kinetic equations up to the six dimensional
case without parallelization. However, the main drawback of the method
developed was the loss of spatial accuracy close to the fluid limit. In the
present work, we modify the scheme in such a way that it is able to preserve
the high order spatial accuracy for extremely rarefied and fluid regimes. In
particular, in the fluid limit, the method automatically degenerates into a
high order method for the compressible Euler equations. Numerical examples are
presented which validate the method, show the higher accuracy with respect to
the previous approach and measure its efficiency with respect to well known
schemes (Direct Simulation Monte Carlo, Finite Volume, MUSCL, WENO).

further use in carbon based electronics. Adapting strategies from classical
silicon based semiconductor technology, we use the incorporation of heteroatoms
in the 2D graphene network as a straightforward way to achieve this goal. Here,
we report on the synthesis of boron-doped graphene on Ni(111) in a chemical
vapor deposition process of triethylborane on the one hand and by segregation
of boron from the bulk on the other hand. The chemical environment of boron was
determined by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and angle resolved photoelectron
spectroscopy was used to analyze the impact on the band structure. Doping with
boron leads to a shift of the graphene bands to lower binding energies. The
shift depends on the doping concentration and for a doping level of 0.3 ML a
shift of up to 1.2 eV is observed. The experimental results are in agreement
with density-functional calculations. Furthermore, our calculations suggest
that doping with boron leads to graphene preferentially adsorbed in the top-fcc
geometry, since the boron atoms in the graphene lattice are then adsorbed at
substrate fcc-hollow sites. The smaller adsorption distance of boron compared
to carbon leads to a bending of the graphene sheet in the vicinity of the boron
atoms. By comparing calculations of doped and undoped graphene on Ni(111), as
well as the respective free-standing cases, we are able to distinguish between
the effects that doping and adsorption have on the band structure of graphene.
Both, doping and bonding to the surface, result in opposing shifts on the
graphene bands.

of cases, we are able to go beyond. We also discuss the cases with dissipation.
It is an aim of the paper to give a coherent exposition of the topic. The paper
includes the derivations and should provide a self contained representation.

Drake","Variability of a stellar corona on a time scale of days","9 pages, 12 figures, Accepted to A&A",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Elemental abundance effects in active coronae have eluded our understanding
for almost three decades, since the discovery of the First Ionization Potential
(FIP) effect on the sun. The goal of this paper is to monitor the same coronal
structures over a time interval of six days and resolve active regions on a
stellar corona through rotational modulation. We report on four iso-phase X-ray
spectroscopic observations of the RS CVn binary EI Eri with XMM-Newton, carried
out approximately every two days, to match the rotation period of EI Eri. We
present an analysis of the thermal and chemical structure of the Ei Eri corona
as it evolves over the six days. Although the corona is rather steady in its
temperature distribution, the emission measure and FIP bias both vary and seem
to be correlated. An active region, predating the beginning of the campaign,
repeatedly enters into our view at the same phase as it rotates from beyond the
stellar limb. As a result, the abundances tend slightly, but consistently, to
increase for high FIP elements (an inverse FIP effect) with phase. We estimate
the abundance increase of high FIP elements in the active region to be of ~75%
over the coronal mean. This observed fractionation of elements in an active
region on time scales of days provides circumstantial clues regarding the
element enrichment mechanism of non-flaring stellar coronae.

networks (NN) to optimize CMOS analog circuits. For modeling and design
recently neural network computational modules have got acceptance as an
unorthodox and useful tool. To achieve high performance of active or passive
circuit component neural network can be trained accordingly. A well trained
neural network can produce more accurate outcome depending on its learning
capability. Neural network model can replace empirical modeling solutions
limited by range and accuracy.[2] Neural network models are easy to obtain for
new circuits or devices which can replace analytical methods. Numerical
modeling methods can also be replaced by neural network model due to their
computationally expansive behavior.[2][10][20]. The pro- posed implementation
is aimed at reducing resource requirement, without much compromise on the
speed. The NN ensures proper functioning by assigning the appropriate inputs,
weights, biases, and excitation function of the layer that is currently being
computed. The concept used is shown to be very effective in reducing resource
requirements and enhancing speed.

statement on the action of the diagonal group $A$ on the space of unimodular
lattices, is equivalent to several assertions about minimal sets for this
action. More generally, for a maximal $\mathbb{R}$-diagonalizable subgroup $A$
of a reductive group $G$ and a lattice $\Gamma$ in $G$, we give a sufficient
condition for a compact $A$-minimal subset $Y$ of $G/\Gamma$ to be of a simple
form, which is also necessary if $G$ is $\mathbb{R}$-split. We also show that
the stabilizer of $Y$ has no nontrivial connected unipotent subgroups.

cultural evolution. The evolution of first names of newborn babies offers a
remarkable example for the researches in the field. Here we perform statistical
analyses on over 100 years of data in the United States. We focus in particular
on how the frequency-rank distribution and inequality of baby names change over
time. We propose a stochastic model where name choice is determined by
personalized preference and social influence. Remarkably, variations on the
strength of personalized preference can account satisfactorily for the observed
empirical features. Therefore, we claim that personalization drives cultural
evolution, at least in the example of baby names.

identification capabilities of a hybrid detector employing both fluorescence
telescopes and particle detectors at ground using simulated data. It involves
the analysis of extensive showers with zenith angles above 60 degrees making
use of the joint distribution of the depth of maximum and muon size at ground
level as mass discriminating parameters. The correlation and sensitivity to the
primary mass are investigated. Two different techniques - clustering algorithms
and neural networks - are adopted to classify the mass identity on an
event-by-event basis. Typical results for the achieved performance of
identification are reported and discussed. The analysis can be extended in a
very straightforward way to vertical showers or can be complemented with
additional discriminating observables coming from different types of detectors.
