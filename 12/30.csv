matter-dominated galaxies, which make them ideal to test the predictions of the
cold dark matter (CDM) model. We argue that the removal of the baryonic
component from gas-rich dwarf irregular galaxies, the progenitors of dSphs, can
substantially reduce their central density. Thus, it may play an important role
in alleviating one of the problems of the CDM model related to the structure of
relatively massive satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). Traditionally,
collisionless cosmological N-body simulations are used when confronting
theoretical predictions with observations. However, these simulations assume
that the baryon fraction everywhere in the Universe is equal to the cosmic
mean, which can be incorrect for dSphs. We find that the combination of (i) the
lower baryon fraction in dSphs compared to the cosmic mean and (ii) the
concentration of baryons in the inner part of the MW halo can go a long way
towards explaining the observed circular velocity profiles of dSphs. We find
that the blowing away of baryons by ram pressure, when the dwarfs fall into
larger galaxies, decreases the circular velocity profile of the satellite and
reduces the density in the central ~200-500 pc by a factor of (1 - f_b)^4 ~
0.5, where f_b is the cosmological fraction of baryons. Additionally, the
enhanced baryonic mass in the central regions of the parent galaxy generates
tidal forces, which are larger than those experienced by subhaloes in
traditional N-body simulations. Increased tidal forces substantially alter
circular velocity profiles for satellites with pericentres less than 50 kpc. We
show that these two effects are strong enough to bring the predictions of
subhaloes from CDM simulations into agreement with the observed structure of MW
dSphs, regardless of the details of the baryonic processes.

the coldest neutron star in its age range. We found marginal evidence for a
double-peaked modulation of the X-ray emission. The study of the 9'-long tail
confirmed the lack of extended emission near the pulsar itself. The tail shows
a very asymmetric brightness profile and its spectrum lacks any spatial
variation. We found the nebular emission to be inconsistent with a classical
bow-shock, ram-pressure dominated pulsar wind nebula. We propose thermal
bremsstrahlung as an alternative mechanism for Morla's tail emission. In this
scenario, the tail emission comes from the shocked interstellar medium (ISM)
material heated up to X-ray temperatures. This can fully explain the peculiar
features of the tail, assuming a hot, moderately dense interstellar medium
around the pulsar. For a bremsstrahlung-emitting tail, we can estimate the
pulsar distance to be between 300 and 900 pc. A pulsar velocity of about 1900
km/s is required - which would make Morla the pulsar with the largest velocity
- and high inclination angles (>70 degrees) are preferred. We propose Morla's
nebula as the first example of a new ""turtle's tail"" class of
thermally-emitting nebulae associated to high velocity pulsars.

reveals that this system can contain a near extreme rotating black hole (e.g.,
McClintock et al. 2011). Confirming the high value of the spin would have

discoseismic models assuming the c- and g- modes are instead favoured. However,
consideration of all three microquasars that display the 3:2 HF QPOs leads to a
serious puzzle because the differences in the individual spins, such as a=0.9

the sight-lines to the quasar central source can go through different regions
of outflowing winds from the accretion disk of the quasar, providing a unique
opportunity to study the structure of outflows from the accretion disk, a key
ingredient for the evolution of quasars as well as for galaxy formation and
evolution. Based on medium- and high-resolution spectroscopy of the two
brightest images conducted at the Subaru telescope, we find that each image has
different intrinsic levels of absorptions, which can be attributed either to
variability of absorption features over the time delay between the lensed

multiple sight-lines toward the quasar. While both these scenarios are
consistent with the current data, we argue that they can be distinguished with

  Model","Dissertation for Ph.D in Department of Physics, UIUC",,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas cond-mat.supr-con","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a Feshbach resonance, the effective s-wave scattering length grows when
one moves toward the resonance point, and eventually diverges at this point.
There is one characteristic energy scale, $\delta_c$, defined as, in the
negative side of the resonance point, the detuning energy at which the weight
of the bound state shifts from predominatedly in the open-channel to
predominated in the closed-channel. When the many-body energy scale (e.g. the
Fermi energy, $E_{F}$) is larger than $\delta_c$, the closed-channel weight is
significant and has to be included in the many-body theory. Furthermore, when
two channels share a hyperfine species, the Pauli exclusion between fermions
from two channels also needs to be taken into consideration in the many-body
theory.
  The current thesis addresses the above problem in detail. A set of gap
equations and number equations are derived at the mean-field level. The
fermionic and bosonic excitation spectra are then derived. Assuming that the
uncoupled bound-state of the closed-channel in resonance is much smaller than
the inter-particle distance, as well as the s-wave scattering length, $a_s$, we
find that the basic equations in the single-channel crossover model are still
valid. The correction first comes from the existing of the finite chemical
potential and additional counting complication due to the closed-channel. These
two corrections need to be included into the mean-field equations, i.e. the gap
equations and the number equations, and be solved self-consistently. Then the
correction due to the inter-channel Pauli exclusion is in the order of the
ratio of the Fermi energy and the Zeeman energy difference between two
channels, $E_F/\eta$, which can be analyzed perturbatively over the previous
corrections.
  Fermionic and bosonic excitation modes are studied.

particles which are produced by such a particle collision and escape to
infinity cannot be very massive nor very energetic. For electrically charged
black holes there is a similar phenomenon, where the center-of-mass energy for
the collision of charged particles near the horizon can be arbitrarily high.
One might expect that there would exist a similar bound on the energy and mass

We explicitly show that superheavy and highly energetic charged particles

Griffith, and although Griffith used the theorem of minimum potential energy
most people seem unaware of the broader implications of this theorem. If it is
set within its classical mechanics roots, it is clear that it is a restricted
form of a Lagrangian.
  In advanced texts on fracture cracks are treated as dynamic entities, and the
role of stress waves is clearly articulated. However, in most non-advanced
texts on fracture and fatigue the role of stress waves are either not included
or not emphasised, often leading to a possible misunderstanding of the
fundamentals of fracture.
  What is done here is to extend Griffiths approach by setting it within the
concept of Stationary Action, and introducing a quasi-static stress wave
unloading model, which connects the energy release mechanism with the stress
field. This leads to a definition of a dynamic stress intensity factor, and
this model is then applied to fatigue of perfectly elastic and elastic-plastic
materials to include crack tip plasticity.
  The results for the Griffiths crack and the dynamic case are retrodiction, to
establish the validity of the methods used. The extension to fatigue gives
significant new results, which show that for elastic-plastic materials the
influence of the maximum stress in the cycle as a fraction of the yield stress,
called the yield stress ratio, has not been recognised. The new form of the
fatigue crack growth relationship derived answers many of the long standing

NGC 1931 with the aim to derive the cluster parameters such as distance,
reddening, age and luminosity/mass function as well as to understand the dust
properties and star formation in the region. The distance to the cluster is
found to be 2.3$\pm$0.3 kpc and the reddening E(B-V) in the region is found to
be variable. The stellar density contours reveal two clustering in the region.
The observations suggest differing reddening law within the cluster region.
Polarization efficiency of the dust grains towards the direction of the cluster
is found to be less than that for the general diffuse interstellar medium
(ISM). The slope of the mass function (-0.98$\pm$0.22) in the southern region
in the mass range 0.8 \textless $M/M_{\sun}$ $\textless$ 9.8 is found to be
shallower in comparison to that in the northern region (-1.26$\pm$0.23), which
is comparable to the Salpeter value (-1.35). The K-band luminosity function
(KLF) of the region is found to be comparable to the average value of slope
(~0.4) for young clusters obtained by Lada & Lada (2003), however, the slope of
the KLF is steeper in the northern region as compared to the southern region.
The region is probably ionized by two B2 main-sequence type stars. The mean age
of the young stellar objects (YSOs) is found to be 2$\pm$1 Myr which suggests
that the identified YSOs could be younger than the ionizing sources of the
region. The morphology of the region, the distribution of the YSOs as well as
ages of the YSOs and ionizing sources indicate a triggered star formation in
the region.

quantum systems and polymers, a prime concern is the identification of the most
probable states and their stationary probabilities or free energies. Often,
these systems have metastable regions or phases, prohibiting to estimate the
stationary probabilities by direct simulation. Efficient sampling methods such
as umbrella sampling, metadynamics and conformational flooding have developed
that perform a number of simulations where the system's potential is biased
such as to accelerate the rare barrier crossing events. A joint free energy
profile or stationary density can then be obtained from these biased
simulations with weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM). This approach (a)
requires a few essential order parameters to be defined in which the histogram
is set up, and (b) assumes that each simulation is in global equilibrium. Both
assumptions make the investigation of high-dimensional systems with previously
unknown energy landscape difficult. Here, we introduce the transition matrix
unweighting (TMU) method, a simple and efficient estimation method which
dismisses both assumptions. The configuration space is discretized into sets,
but these sets are not only restricted to the selected slow coordinate but can
be clusters that form a partition of high-dimensional state space. The
assumption of global equilibrium is replaced by requiring only local
equilibrium within the discrete sets, and the stationary density or free energy
is extracted from the transitions between clusters. We prove the asymptotic
convergence and normality of TMU, give an efficient approximate version of it
and demonstrate its usefulness on numerical examples.

stars with a wide range of activity levels. We perform forward-type
magnetohydrodynamical numerical experiments for Alfven wave-driven stellar
winds with a wide range of the input Poynting flux from the photosphere.
Increasing the magnetic field strength and the turbulent velocity at the
stellar photosphere from the current solar level, the mass loss rate rapidly
increases at first owing to the suppression of the reflection of the Alfven
waves. The surface materials are lifted up by the magnetic pressure associated
with the Alfven waves, and the cool dense chromosphere is intermittently
extended to 10 -- 20 % of the stellar radius. The dense atmospheres enhance the
radiative losses and eventually most of the input Poynting energy from the
stellar surface escapes by the radiation. As a result, there is no more
sufficient energy remained for the kinetic energy of the wind; the stellar wind
saturates in very active stars, as observed in Wood et al. The saturation level
is positively correlated with B_{r,0}f_0, where B_{r,0} and f_0 are the
magnetic field strength and the filling factor of open flux tubes at the
photosphere. If B_{r,0}f_0 is relatively large >~ 5 G, the mass loss rate could
be as high as 1000 times. If such a strong mass loss lasts for ~ 1 billion
years, the stellar mass itself is affected, which could be a solution to the
faint young sun paradox. We derive a Reimers-type scaling relation that
estimates the mass loss rate from the energetics consideration of our
simulations. Finally, we derive the evolution of the mass loss rates, \dot{M}
t^{-1.23}, of our simulations, combining with an observed time evolution of
X-ray flux from sun-like stars, which is shallower than \dot{M}
t^{-2.33+/-0.55} in Wood et al.(2005).

the Boltzmann equation. The techniques of asymptotic matching and

the sense that when inserting a positive integer into a tableau, the output is
a distribution of weights on a particular set of tableaux which includes the
output which would have been obtained via the usual column insertion algorithm.
There is also a notion of recording tableau in this setting. We show that the
distribution of weights of the pair of tableaux obtained when one applies the
q-insertion algorithm to a random word or permutation takes a particularly
simple form and is closely related to q-Whittaker functions. In the case $0\le
q<1$, the q-insertion algorithm applied to a random word also provides a new
framework for solving the q-TASEP interacting particle system introduced (in
the language of q-bosons) by Sasamoto and Wadati (1998) and yields formulas
which are equivalent to some of those recently obtained by Borodin and Corwin

well as gaseous and stellar disks, a dark matter halo, and a stellar bulge)
following either an isothermal or an NFW density profile with varying mass and
initial spin. In addition, galactic winds associated with star formation are
tested in some of the simulations. We evolve these isolated galaxy models using
the GADGET-3 $N$-body/hydrodynamic simulation code, paying particular attention
to the effects of the gas halo on the evolution. We find that the evolution of
the models is strongly affected by the adopted gas halo component. The model
without a gas halo shows an increasing star formation rate (SFR) at the
beginning of the simulation for some hundreds of millions of years and then a
continuously decreasing rate to the end of the run at 3 Gyr. On the other hand,
the SFRs in the models with a gas halo emerge to be either relatively flat
throughout the simulations or increasing over a gigayear and then decreasing to
the end. The models with the more centrally concentrated NFW gas halo show
overall higher SFRs than those with the isothermal gas halo of the equal mass.
The gas accretion from the halo onto the disk also occurs more in the models
with the NFW gas halo, however, this is shown to take place mostly in the inner
part of the disk and not to contribute significantly to the star formation
unless the gas halo has very high density at the central part. The rotation of
a gas halo is found to make SFR lower in the model. The SFRs in the runs
including galactic winds are found to be lower than the same runs but without
winds. We conclude that the effects of a hot gaseous halo on the evolution of
galaxies are generally too significant to be simply ignored, and expect that
more hydrodynamical processes in galaxies could be understood through numerical
simulations employing both gas disk and gas halo components.

stars show cyclic variations of the specified parameters. For T Cep, U UMi and
U Cyg, the values of quasi-period of the variations of average brightness are
about 1400, 1025 and 1680 days, respectively. For the stars T Cep, U UMi and BG

associate the scaling transformation with nonlocal interactions. On one hand,
the association leads us to interpret the nonlocality with locally symmetric
method. On the other hand, we find that the nonlocal interaction between
hadrons could be test ground for scaling transformation if ascribing the
running effects in renormalization to scaling transformation. First we derive
directly from group theory the operator/coordinate representation and
unitary/spinor representation for scaling transformation, then link them
together by inquiring a scaling-invariant interaction vertex mimicking the
similar process of Lorentz transformation applied to Dirac equation. The main
feature of this paper is that we discuss both the representations in a sole
physical frame. The representations correspond respectively to the spatial
freedom and the intrinsic freedom of the same quantum system. And the latter is
recognized to contribute to spin angular momentum that in literature has never
been considered seriously. The nonlocal interaction Lagrangian turns out to
vary under scaling transformation, analogous to running cases in
renormalization. And the total Lagrangian becomes scale invariant only under
some extreme conditions. The conservation law of this extreme Lagrangian is
discussed and a contribution named scalum appears to the spin angular momentum.
Finally a mechanism is designed to test the scaling effect on nonlocal
interaction.

a Very Qualified scientist, VQS, about the dependence of mass upon speed if
relativistic corrections are taken into account. VQS believes that since mass
is a scalar, it cannot depend upon speed and has to be the same in all inertial
coordinate frames. In his view, the very idea of speed dependence of the mass
of a particle or a body is incorrect and misleading. As such, the notion of
speed dependence of a particle mass has to be eliminated from textbooks on
physics and from teaching of this subject. The author claims that this notion
has the right to exist, is easily understandable and convenient for most of the
students, both non physicists and even physicist. His view is that it is
nothing wrong in expressions like particle mass increases with the growth of
speed. His view upon the debate is that both approaches are equally correct.
His view is that the dilemma depends or not depends is a matter of taste and
convenience, not of scientific importance and unavoidable scientific rigor.

consequences of the CAIN. We use the CAIN to discuss Maxwell demon processes
(i.e., thermodynamic processes with feedback.) In particular, we apply the CAIN
to four cases of the Szilard engine: for a classical or a quantum system with
either one or two correlated particles. Besides proposing this new inequality
that we call the CAIN, another novel feature of this paper is that we use
quantum Bayesian networks for our analysis of Maxwell demon processes.
