the superposition of the metric Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian with an $f(\cal R)$
term constructed \`{a} la Palatini. The theory predicts the existence of a
long-range scalar field, which passes the Solar System observational
constraints, even if the scalar field is very light, and modifies the
cosmological and galactic dynamics. Thus, the theory opens new possibilities to
approach, in the same theoretical framework, the problems of both dark energy
and dark matter. In this work, we consider the generalized virial theorem in
the scalar-tensor representation of the hybrid metric-Palatini gravity. More
specifically, taking into account the relativistic collisionless Boltzmann
equation, we show that the supplementary geometric terms in the gravitational
field equations provide an effective contribution to the gravitational
potential energy. We show that the total virial mass is proportional to the
effective mass associated with the new terms generated by the effective scalar
field, and the baryonic mass. This shows that the geometric origin in the
generalized virial theorem may account for the well-known virial theorem mass
discrepancy in clusters of galaxies. In addition to this, we also consider
astrophysical applications of the model and show that the model predicts that
the mass associated to the scalar field and its effects extend beyond the
virial radius of the clusters of galaxies. In the context of the galaxy cluster
velocity dispersion profiles predicted by the hybrid metric-Palatini model, the
generalized virial theorem can be an efficient tool in observationally testing
the viability of this class of generalized gravity models.

assumption of thermodynamic equilibrium. However, the transitions between
different phases of matter can be strongly affected by non-equilibrium
phenomena. Here we demonstrate and explain an example of non-equilibrium
stalling of a continuous, second-order phase transition. We create a
superheated atomic Bose gas, in which a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) persists
above the equilibrium critical temperature, $T_c$, if its coupling to the
surrounding thermal bath is reduced by tuning interatomic interactions. For
vanishing interactions the BEC persists in the superheated regime for a minute.
However, if strong interactions are suddenly turned on, it rapidly ""boils""
away. Our observations can be understood within a two-fluid picture, treating
the condensed and thermal components of the gas as separate equilibrium systems
with a tuneable inter-component coupling. We experimentally reconstruct a
non-equilibrium phase diagram of our gas, and theoretically reproduce its main

BK Lyncis, a nova-like star strangely located below the 2-3 hour orbital period
gap in the family of cataclysmic variables. Two apparent ""superhumps"" dominate
the nightly light curves - with periods 4.6% longer, and 3.0% shorter, than
P_orb. The first appears to be associated with the star's brighter states
(V~14), while the second appears to be present throughout and becomes very
dominant in the low state (V~15.7).
  Starting in the year 2005, the star's light curve became indistinguishable
from that of a dwarf nova - in particular, that of the ER UMa subclass.
Reviewing all the star's oddities, we speculate: (a) BK Lyn is the remnant of
the probable nova on 30 December 101, and (b) it has been fading ever since,
but has taken ~2000 years for the accretion rate to drop sufficiently to permit
dwarf-nova eruptions. If such behavior is common, it can explain other puzzles
of CV evolution. One: why the ER UMa class even exists (because all members can
be remnants of recent novae). Two: why ER UMa stars and short-period novalikes
are rare (because their lifetimes, which are essentially cooling times, are
short). Three: why short-period novae all decline to luminosity states far
above their true quiescence (because they're just getting started in their
postnova cooling). Four: why the orbital periods, accretion rates, and
white-dwarf temperatures of short-period CVs are somewhat too large to arise
purely from the effects of gravitational radiation (because the unexpectedly
long interval of enhanced postnova brightness boosts the mean mass-transfer
rate). These are substantial rewards in return for one investment of
hypothesis: that the second parameter in CV evolution, besides P_orb, is time
since the last classical-nova eruption.

universal approximators, principal cubic complexes. Principal cubic complexes
generalise the notion of principal manifolds for datasets with non-trivial

dimension and a grammar of elementary graph transformations. The simplest
grammar produces principal trees.
  We introduce three natural types of data complexity: 1) geometric (deviation
of the data's approximator from some ""idealized"" configuration, such as
deviation from harmonicity); 2) structural (how many elements of a principal
graph are needed to approximate the data), and 3) construction complexity (how
many applications of elementary graph transformations are needed to construct
the principal object starting from the simplest one).
  We compute these measures for several simulated and real-life data
distributions and show them in the ""accuracy-complexity"" plots, helping to
optimize the accuracy/complexity ratio. We discuss various issues connected
with measuring data complexity. Software for computing data complexity measures
from principal cubic complexes is provided as well.

associated Fricke-Vogt invariant. These results are elucidated for some simple
choices of the local potential pieces, such as piecewise constant ones and

astrophysics research. Geodesy and the study of tectonic plate motion is
another important area of research for New Zealand radio astronomy to
contribute to. As New Zealand is located at the boundary between two colliding
tectonic plates (Australian and Pacific) and most of geological activity in New
Zealand originates from their motion, it is important to monitor the relative
plate motion with high precision using both GPS and radio astronomical
techniques. We discuss radio frequency interference (RFI) as a limiting factor

use an effective 1+1 dimensional quasi-Abelian model to describe the dynamical

the microscopic quantum structure of Schwarzschild black hole and quantum
statistical origin of its gravity are studied. The cutoff of black hole horizon
leads to Casimir effect inside the horizon. This effect makes the inside vacuum
has less zero quantum fluctuation energy than that of outside vacuum and the
spin 1/2 radiation hole excitations are resulted inside the horizon. The mean
energy of the radiation hole excitations is related to the temperature decrease
of the Hawking-Unruh type by the period law of the Fermion temperature greens
function and a temperature difference as well as gravity are created on the
horizon. A dual relation of the gravity potentials between inside and outside
regions of the black hole is found. An attractor behaviour of the horizon
surface is unveiled. The gravity potential inside the black hole is linear in
radial coordinate and no singularity exists at the origin of the black hole, in
contrast to the conventional conjecture. All the particles absorbed by the
black hole have fallen down to the horizon and converted into spin 1/2
radiation quanta with the mean energy related to the Hawking-Unruh temperature,
the thermodynamic equilibrium and the mechanical balance make the radiation
quanta be tightly bound in the horizon. The gravitation mass $2M$ and physical
mass $M$ of the black hole are calculated. The calculated entropy of the black
hole is well consistent with Hawking. Outside the horizon, there exist
thermodynamic non-equilibrium and mechanical non-balance which lead to an
outward centrifugal energy flow and an inward gravitation energy flow. The lost
vacuum energy in the negative gravitation potential region has been removed to
the black hole surface to form a spherical Planckon shell with the thickness of
Planckon diameter so that energy conservation is guaranteed.

From the extracted influence, we conduct in-depth analysis on how influence
varies over different topics and how influence varies over different members.
We also show the potentials of leveraging the extracted influence to make
personalized recommendation in BIGLOBE. To our best knowledge, this is one of

test the possibility of detecting the variation in the X-ray source number
counts over the celestial sphere. A large number of Chandra pointings spread
over both galactic hemispheres are investigated. We searched for all the
point-like sources in the soft band of 0.5 - 2 keV and statistically assessed
the population of sources below the detection threshold. A homogeneous sample
of the number counts at fluxes above ~10^{-15} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} was
constructed for more than 300 ACIS fields. The sources were counted within a
circular area of 15 arcmin diameter. The count correlations between overlapping

variance generated by the large-scale structures. The rms variations of the

timecorrelation functions in many-body systems from samples of short
trajectories. In this framework, it is proposed to bias the importance function
using the lowest Jacobian eigenvalue moduli along the dynamical trajectory. A
lowest eigenvalue modulus is related to the lowest eigenvalue of the Hessian
matrix and is evaluated here using the Lanczos algorithm as in
activation-relaxation techniques. This results in favoring the sampling of
activated trajectories and enhancing the occurrence of the rare reactive
trajectories of interest, those corresponding to transitions between locally
stable states. Estimating the time-correlation functions involves unbiasing the
sample of simulated trajectories which is done using the multi-state Bennett
acceptance ratio (MBAR) method. To assess the performance of our procedure, we
compute the time-correlation function associated with the migration of a
vacancy in {\alpha}-iron. The derivative of the estimated time-correlation
function yields a migration rate in agreement with the one given by transition
state theory. Besides, we show that the information relative to rejected
trajectories can be recycled within MBAR, resulting in a substantial speed-up.
Unlike original transition path-sampling, our approach does not require
computing the reversible work to confine the trajectory endpoints to a reactive
state.

Programming (ASP) systems, and in particular the grounding components of ASP

has received some interest in this setting, and a variant of it, called DMS,
has been proposed for ASP. However, this technique has a caveat, because it is
not correct (in the sense of being query-equivalent) for all ASP programs. In
recent work, a large fragment of ASP programs, referred to as super-coherent
programs, has been identified, for which DMS is correct. The fragment contains
all programs which possess at least one answer set, no matter which set of
facts is added to them. Two open question remained: How complex is it to
determine whether a given program is super-coherent? Does the restriction to
super-coherent programs limit the problems that can be solved? Especially the
first question turned out to be quite difficult to answer precisely. In this
paper, we formally prove that deciding whether a propositional program is
super-coherent is \Pi^P_3-complete in the disjunctive case, while it is
\Pi^P_2-complete for normal programs. The hardness proofs are the difficult
part in this endeavor: We proceed by characterizing the reductions by the
models and reduct models which the ASP programs should have, and then provide
instantiations that meet the given specifications. Concerning the second
question, we show that all relevant ASP reasoning tasks can be transformed into
tasks over super-coherent programs, even though this transformation is more of
theoretical than practical interest.

is useful to improve our understanding of flaring processes. Here we
investigate the deviation of the non-linear field configuration from that of
the linear and potential configurations, and study the free energy available
leading up to and after a flare. The evolution of the magnetic field in NOAA
region 10953 was examined using data from Hinode/SOT-SP, over a period of 12
hours leading up to and after a GOES B1.0 flare. Previous work on this region
found pre- and post-flare changes in photospheric vector magnetic field
parameters of flux elements outside the primary sunspot. 3D geometry was thus
investigated using potential, linear force-free, and non-linear force-free
field extrapolations in order to fully understand the evolution of the field
lines. Traced field line geometrical and footpoint orientation differences show
that the field does not completely relax to a fully potential or linear
force-free state after the flare. Magnetic and free magnetic energies increase
significantly ~ 6.5-2.5 hours before the flare by ~ 10^31 erg. After the flare,
the non-linear force-free magnetic energy and free magnetic energies decrease
but do not return to pre-flare 'quiet' values. The post-flare non-linear
force-free field configuration is closer (but not equal) to that of the linear
force-free field configuration than a potential one. However, the small degree
of similarity suggests that partial Taylor relaxation has occurred over a time
scale of ~ 3-4 hours.

particle system whose empirical distribution at time t, seen as a process in t,
has the law of the quenched SLFV. In all these results, the facts that we work

rotational temperature Trot \sim 25 K, non-thermal velocity dispersion ~1.1
km/s, and exhibit signs of star formation, while filaments appear to be more
quiescent (Trot \sim 11 K, non-thermal velocity dispersion ~0.6 km/s).
Filaments are parallel in projection and distributed mainly along two
directions, at PA \sim 10 deg and 60 deg, and appear to be coherent in
velocity. The averaged projected separation between adjacent filaments is
between 0.5 pc and 1pc, and the mean width of filaments is 0.12 pc. Cores
within filaments are separated by ~0.33 pc, which is consistent with the
predicted fragmentation of an isothermal gas cylinder due to the 'sausage'-type

suboptimal systems in practice. We describe a general mathematical strategy to
learn the parameters and, to some extent, the architecture of nested systems,
called the method of auxiliary coordinates (MAC). This replaces the original
problem involving a deeply nested function with a constrained problem involving
a different function in an augmented space without nesting. The constrained
problem may be solved with penalty-based methods using alternating optimization
over the parameters and the auxiliary coordinates. MAC has provable
convergence, is easy to implement reusing existing algorithms for single
layers, can be parallelized trivially and massively, applies even when
parameter derivatives are not available or not desirable, and is competitive
with state-of-the-art nonlinear optimizers even in the serial computation
setting, often providing reasonable models within a few iterations.

variations that can mask or even mimic the RV signature of orbiting exoplanets.
For this reason RV exoplanet surveys have been unsuccessful when searching for
planets around young, active stars and are therefore failing to explore an
important regime which can help to reveal how planets form and migrate. This
paper describes a new technique to remove spot signatures from the stellar
line-profiles of moderately rotating, active stars (vsini ranging from 10 to 50
km/s). By doing so it allows planetary RV signals to be uncovered. We used
simulated models of a G5V type star with differing dark spots on its surface
along with archive data of the known active star HD49933 to validate our
method. The results showed that starspots could be effectively cleaned from the
line-profiles so that the stellar RV jitter was reduced by more than 80%.
Applying this procedure to the same models and HD49933 data, but with fake
planets injected, enabled the effective removal of starspots so that Jupiter
mass planets on short orbital periods were successfully recovered. These
results show that this approach can be useful in the search for hot-Jupiter
planets that orbit around young, active stars with a vsini of 10 - 50 km/s.

antiferromagnets on hexagonal lattices, including the longitudinal modes based
on the magnon-density waves. A model Hamiltonian with a uniaxial single-ion
anisotropy is first studied by a spin-wave theory based on the one-boson
method; the ground state thus obtained is employed for the study of the
longitudinal modes. The full energy spectra of both the transverse modes (i.e.,
magnons) and the longitudinal modes are obtained as functions of the
nearest-neighbor coupling and the anisotropy constants. We have found two
longitudinal modes due to the non-collinear nature of the triangular
antiferromagnetic order, similar to that of the phenomenological field theory
approach by Affleck. The excitation energy gaps due to the anisotropy and the
energy gaps of the longitudinal modes without anisotropy are then investigated.
We then compare our results for the longitudinal energy gaps at the magnetic
wavevectors with the experimental results for several antiferromagnetic
compounds with both integer and non-integer spin quantum numbers, and we find
good agreement after the higher-order contributions are included in our
calculations.

moments in the rare-earth doped iron pnictide Ca_{1-x}RE_xFe_2As_2 (RE=La, Pr,

decrease significantly with temperature and goes from ~0.9 \mu_B at T = 300 K
to ~0.45 \mu_B at T = 70 K. In the collapsed tetragonal (cT) phase of Nd- and
Pr-doped samples (T<70K) the local moment is quenched, while the moment remains
unchanged for the La-doped sample, which does not show lattice collapse. Our
results show that Ca_{1-x}RE_xFe_2As_2 (RE= Pr and Nd) exhibits a spin-state
transition and provide direct evidence for a non-magnetic Fe^{2+} ion in the
cT-phase, as predicted by Yildirim. We argue that the gradual change of the the
spin-state over a wide temperature range reveals the importance of multiorbital
physics, in particular the competition between the crystal field split Fe 3d
orbitals and the Hund's rule coupling.
