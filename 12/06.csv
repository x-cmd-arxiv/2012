its effects around the Big Rip. Later, treating the turbulence energy density
as a part of total dark fluid, we study the stability of the system. The result
shows that the stability is achieving as the energy density of turbulence
decreases, changing into heat (the radiation), in perfect agreement with the

structures undermining the kernel estimation will be removed. Second, to
mitigate the possible adverse effect of salient edges and improve the
robustness of kernel estimation, we applied a gradient selection method. Third,
we proposed a novel kernel estimation method, which is capable of preserving
the continuity and sparsity of the kernel and reducing the noises. Finally, we
developed an adaptive weighted spatial prior, for the purpose of preserving
sharp edges in latent image restoration. The effectiveness of our method is
demonstrated by experiments on various kinds of challenging examples.

through the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. These two physical processes can be
characterized by the integrated Comptonization parameter Y_SZ DA^2 and its
X-ray counterpart, the Y_X parameter. The ratio of these two quantities is
expected to be constant from numerical simulations and current observations. We
show that this fact can be exploited to constrain alpha, as the ratio of the
two parameters depends on the fine structure constant as alpha^{3.5}. We
determine current constraints from a combination of Planck SZ and XMM-Newton

comparable with current CMB constraints. We discuss strategies for further
improving these constraints by almost an order of magnitude.

a Gibbs-like ensemble of scattering states. The steady state I am considering

steady state occurs as a result of a large-time evolution from an initial state
where two halves of the system are separately thermalized. I also show how this

on 2011 November 12, about 100 days after the onset of the bursting activity
that had led to the discovery of the source on 2011 August 07. This long time
span enabled us to refine the rotational ephemeris and observe a downturn in
the decay of the X-ray flux. Assuming a broken power law for the long-term
light curve, the break was at ~46 d after the outburst onset, when the decay
index changed from alpha ~ 0.4 to ~4.5. The flux decreased by a factor ~2 in
the first ~50 d and then by a factor ~40 until November 2011 (overall, by a
factor ~70 in ~100 d). At the same time, the spectrum, which was well described
by an absorbed blackbody all along the outburst, softened, the temperature
dropping from ~1 to ~0.6 keV. Diffuse X-ray emission extending up to 20"" from
the source was clearly detected in all Chandra observations. Its spatial and
spectral properties, as well as its time evolution, are consistent with a
dust-scattering halo due to a single cloud located at a distance of
$\approx$200 pc from Swift J1834.9-0846, which should be in turn located at a
distance of ~5 kpc. Considering the time delay of the scattered photons, the
same dust cloud might also be responsible for the more extended emission
detected in XMM-Newton data taken in September 2011. We searched for the radio
signature of Swift J1834.9-0846 at radio frequencies using the Green Bank Radio
Telescope and in archival data collected at Parkes from 1998 to 2003. No
evidence for radio emission was found, down to a flux density of 0.05 mJy (at 2
GHz) during the outburst and ~0.2-0.3 mJy (at 1.4 GHz) in the older data.

accurate knowledge of the bistatic delay. Noise, measurement error, and the
problem of dense, overlapping multipath signals in the measured UWB channel
impulse response (CIR) all contribute to make bistatic delay estimation
challenging. It is often assumed that a calibration CIR, that is, a measurement
from when no person is present, is easily subtracted from a newly captured CIR.
We show this is often not the case. We propose modeling the difference between
a current set of CIRs and a set of calibration CIRs as a hidden Markov model
(HMM). Multiple experimental deployments are performed to collect CIR data and
test the performance of this model and compare its performance to existing
methods. Our experimental results show an RMSE of 2.85 ns and 2.76 ns for our
HMM-based approach, compared to a thresholding method which, if the ideal
threshold is known a priori, achieves 3.28 ns and 4.58 ns. By using the
Baum-Welch algorithm, the HMM-based estimator is shown to be very robust to
initial parameter settings. Localization performance is also improved using the
HMM-based bistatic delay estimates.

by radiation of the ionized gas inside the bubble. So, studies show that in
certain cases neither an imploding shock nor a plasma has been observed and the

Bubble SonoLuminescence remains a subject of study. For this study we consider
the bubble as a box where the free particles (particularly electrons) stemming
from the molecules dissociation, are are trapped and confined within the
bubble. The confinement allows the particles to acquire some energy during the
collapse which they lose in the form of light and also to be considered to bind
to the bubble as an electron is bound to the nucleus in an atom. So, with
regard to the bubble the energy of the particles can be considered to quantify,
and with the quantum theory, by putting some hypotheses, their energy is
determined well. The energy is physically acceptable that if the bubble is
spherical. This necessary condition of a spherical bubble of the model is

the universe begin with an extremely low entropy and how did it evolve into
such high entropy at late times? It has been long believed that inflation
cannot be the solution since it requires an extremely low entropy to ever
occur. However, we point out that since the inflation is always accompanied
with a horizon, the correct probability of inflation is associated with the
quantum entanglement entropy, which should in principle be larger than what
considered previously. This motivates us to reexamine the issue by computing
the evolution of the cosmological entanglement entropy in the early universe.
We invoke a toy model of nonlinear generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG), which has
the advantage of providing a smooth and unitary transition between the
inflation epoch and the radiation dominant era. We found that soon after the
onset of the inflation, the total entanglement entropy rapidly decreases to a
minimum, and it rises monotonically afterwards throughout the remainder of the
inflation and the radiation epochs. This indicates that the universe does not
need to begin with an extremely low entropy; its smallness can be naturally
induced by the dynamics of inflation itself. We believe that our computation
largely captures the essential feature of entropy evolution and can provide us
insights beyond the toy model.

as well as calcium-dependent potassium current. Calcium dynamics includes
buffering and pumping. In sections 3-9, each component is considered in detail
and parameters estimated from voltage clamp data where possible. In the next
two sections simplified versions of some components are employed to explore the
effects of various parameters on spiking, using a systematic approach, ending
up with the following eleven components: a fast sodium current $I_{Na}$, a
delayed rectifier potassium current $I_{KDR}$, a transient potassium current
$I_A$, a low-threshold calcium current $I_T$, two high threshold calcium
currents $I_L$ and $I_N$, small and large conductance potassium currents

  Applications","35 pagers, 12 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The accuracy of machine learning systems is a widely studied research topic.
Established techniques such as cross-validation predict the accuracy on unseen
data of the classifier produced by applying a given learning method to a given
training data set. However, they do not predict whether incurring the cost of
obtaining more data and undergoing further training will lead to higher
accuracy. In this paper we investigate techniques for making such early
predictions. We note that when a machine learning algorithm is presented with a
training set the classifier produced, and hence its error, will depend on the
characteristics of the algorithm, on training set's size, and also on its
specific composition. In particular we hypothesise that if a number of
classifiers are produced, and their observed error is decomposed into bias and
variance terms, then although these components may behave differently, their
behaviour may be predictable.
  We test our hypothesis by building models that, given a measurement taken
from the classifier created from a limited number of samples, predict the
values that would be measured from the classifier produced when the full data
set is presented. We create separate models for bias, variance and total error.
Our models are built from the results of applying ten different machine
learning algorithms to a range of data sets, and tested with ""unseen""
algorithms and datasets. We analyse the results for various numbers of initial
training samples, and total dataset sizes. Results show that our predictions
are very highly correlated with the values observed after undertaking the extra
training. Finally we consider the more complex case where an ensemble of
heterogeneous classifiers is trained, and show how we can accurately estimate
an upper bound on the accuracy achievable after further training.

algorithm for the initial vorticity direction. The new analysis uses a new

the lower-order moments bounding the higher-order moments from above,
consistent with new results from several Navier-Stokes

assumed to hold, then a singular upper bound on the growth of these moments can
be used to provide a prediction of power law growth to compare against. There
is a significant period where the growth of the highest moments converges to
these singular bounds, demonstrating a tie between the strongest nonlinear
growth and how the rescaled vorticity moments are ordered. The logarithmic

reasonably strong computational sense, the almost universal existence of time

generalization error, and its resulting margins, among many other objects, for
fixed data sets under arguably reasonable conditions. Specifically, we frame
Optimal AdaBoost as a dynamical system and, employing tools from ergodic
theory, prove that, under a condition that Optimal AdaBoost does not have ties

evidence from high dimensional real-world datasets, the algorithm's update
behaves like a continuous map. We provide constructive proofs of several

dynamical system is ergodic; and establish sufficient conditions for the same

conjectures, at least from a broad computational-theory perspective: AdaBoost
always cycles and is an ergodic dynamical system. We present empirical evidence

"1212.1113","Samuele Mongodi","Samuele Mongodi","Application of metric currents to complex analysis","PhD Thesis",,,,"math.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2000, Ambrosio and Kirchheim, with the paper ""Currents in metric spaces"",
settled the foundations of a theory of currents on metric spaces and used it to
pose and solve Plateau's problem in a wide class of Banach spaces. Following an
idea of De Giorgi, they gave a new definition of current which was meaningful
on any metric space. A metric current is a multilinear functional on
(k+1)-tuples of Lipschitz functions (with the first one bounded) satisfying a
continuity property, a locality property and a finite mass property. The second
chapter of the thesis is devoted to the theory of local metric currents. We
introduce the basic concepts and adapt the theory to the complex case, defining
the bidimension, the Dolbeault decomposition and related notions. A
characterization of holomorphic currents is given. The development of a Sobolev
theory on singular space is our main concern in the third chapter. We give a
characterization of Sobolev functions in terms of their behavior and growth on
the regular part; this leads to a capacity theory for the singular set which
allows us to obtain an approximation result, using functions with support in
the regular part. The second part of the chapter deals with the L2 theory on
singular spaces. In the fourth chapter, some applications of the theory are
discussed. We solve Cauchy-Riemann equation on completely reducible
singularities, by means of a structure theorem for metric currents; we also
treat the equation in Lp on complex curves and outline a possible approach for
the same problem on complex spaces which can be embedded as divisors in C^n.
The final chapter tries to spread some light on the complex geometry in
infinite dimensional spaces. After solving the Cauchy-Riemann equation in
Banach spaces, in terms of the quasi-local metric currents, we turn to the
study of positive currents, holomorphic chains and their boundaries in Hilbert
spaces.

changes in the environment as well as to buffer perturbations and maintain
cellular homeostasis in the absence of change. Theoretical work and empirical
investigation in Escherichia coli have shown that negative autoregulation
confers both rapid response times and reduced intrinsic noise, which is
reflected in the fact that almost half of Escherichia coli transcription
factors are negatively autoregulated. However, negative autoregulation is
exceedingly rare amongst the transcription factors of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
This difference is all the more surprising because E. coli and S. cerevisiae
otherwise have remarkably similar profiles of network motifs. In this study we
first show that regulatory interactions amongst the transcription factors of
Drosophila melanogaster and humans have a similar dearth of negative
autoregulation to that seen in S. cerevisiae. We then present a model
demonstrating that this fundamental difference in the noise reduction
strategies used amongst species can be explained by constraints on the
evolution of negative autoregulation in diploids. We show that regulatory
interactions between pairs of homologous genes within the same cell can lead to
under-dominance - mutations which result in stronger autoregulation, and
decrease noise in homozygotes, paradoxically can cause increased noise in
heterozygotes. This severely limits a diploid's ability to evolve negative
autoregulation as a noise reduction mechanism. Our work offers a simple and
general explanation for a previously unexplained difference between the
regulatory architectures of E. coli and yeast, Drosophila and humans. It also
demonstrates that the effects of diploidy in gene networks can have
counter-intuitive consequences that may profoundly influence the course of
evolution.

formation, similar in many respects to the Cartwheel galaxy. The Cartwheel
galaxy is famous for hosting 12 ULX, most of which are in the star forming
ring. This is the largest number of ULX seen in a single system, and has led to
speculation that the low metallicity of the Cartwheel (0.3 solar) may optimize
the conditions for ULX formation. In contrast, NGC 922 has metallicity near
solar. The Chandra observations reveal a population of bright X-ray sources,
including 7 ULX. The number of ULX in NGC 922 and the Cartwheel scales with the
star formation rate: we do not find any evidence for an excess of sources in
the Cartwheel. Simulations of the binary population in these galaxies suggest
that the ULX population in both systems is dominated by systems with strong
wind accretion from supergiant donors onto direct-collapse BHs. The simulations
correctly predict the ratio of the number of sources in NGC 922 and the
Cartwheel. Thus it would appear that the the metallicity of the Cartwheel is
not low enough to see a difference in the ULX population compared to NGC 922.

statistical nature, according to Boltzmann, meaning that its reliability arises
from the vast number of particles present in macroscopic systems. This means
that such systems will lead towards their most likely state, that is, the one
with the most homogeneous probability distribution. However, Boltzmann states
that entropy-decreasing processes can occur (without doing any work) - it is
just very improbable. It is therefore not impossible, in principle, for all 6 x
10^23 atoms in a mole of a gas to spontaneously move to one half of a
container; it is only fantastically unlikely.
  A similar idea has here been applied to a human cell. All somatic cells seem
to age and deteriorate in unfavorable conditions. If the ageing process is
defined as the accumulation of dysfunctional polymers resulting from, among
other things, chemical bond breakage, where polymers aggregate into harmful
arrangements, spreading out randomly in the cell and leading to an altered
function, then it also applies that there will be a difference in entropy
between, for instance, a 20-year old individual and the same individual at age
80.
  The goal of this article is to demonstrate that the second law does not tell
us that the cell necessarily must go toward a high entropy state and stay that
way but that it is possible - according to statistical mechanics - for an old
cell to experience a return to a younger state. We find the probability of this
spontaneous return to a more ordered state to be expressed by P =
10^(-202)^(-889). In spite of this number, it does show that a reversal of the
ageing process is not prohibited by nature. There is a theoretical possibility
of rejuvenation. Whether this will ever become a practical reality is another
matter.

innervation of nearly the whole brain have important modulatory effects on many
cognitive and physiological processes. They play important roles in clinical
depression and other psychiatric disorders. In order to quantify the effects of
serotonergic transmission on target cells it is desirable to construct
computational models and to this end these it is necessary to have details of
the biophysical and spike properties of the serotonergic neurons. Here several
basic properties are reviewed with data from several studies since the 1960s to
the present. The quantities included are input resistance, resting membrane
potential, membrane time constant, firing rate, spike duration, spike and
afterhyperpolarization (AHP) amplitude, spike threshold, cell capacitance, soma
and somadendritic areas. The action potentials of these cells are normally
triggered by a combination of sodium and calcium currents which may result in
autonomous pacemaker activity. We here analyse the mechanisms of high-threshold
calcium spikes which have been demonstrated in these cells the presence of TTX.
The parameters for calcium dynamics required to give calcium spikes are quite
different from those for regular spiking which suggests the involvement of
restricted parts of the soma-dendritic surface as has been found, for example,
in hippocampal neurons.

natural multiscale structure: sub-tasks are assembled together to accomplish
complex goals. Systematically inferring and leveraging hierarchical structure,

challenge. We describe a fast multiscale procedure for repeatedly compressing,
or homogenizing, Markov decision processes (MDPs), wherein a hierarchy of
sub-problems at different scales is automatically determined. Coarsened MDPs
are themselves independent, deterministic MDPs, and may be solved using
existing algorithms. The multiscale representation delivered by this procedure
decouples sub-tasks from each other and can lead to substantial improvements in
convergence rates both locally within sub-problems and globally across
sub-problems, yielding significant computational savings. A second fundamental
aspect of this work is that these multiscale decompositions yield new transfer
opportunities across different problems, where solutions of sub-tasks at
different levels of the hierarchy may be amenable to transfer to new problems.
Localized transfer of policies and potential operators at arbitrary scales is
emphasized. Finally, we demonstrate compression and transfer in a collection of
illustrative domains, including examples involving discrete and continuous

features in the majority of the detected groups are linked to the individual
galaxies, in the form of both plumes and halos likely as a result of star
formation or AGN activity, as well as in emission from tidal features. Unlike
previous studies from earlier X-ray missions, HCGs 31, 42, 59, and 92 are found
to be consistent with the Lx-T relationship from clusters within the errors,
while HCGs 16 and 31 are consistent with the cluster Lx-sigma relation, though
this is likely coincidental given that the hot gas in these two systems is
largely due to star formation. We find that Lx increases with decreasing group
HI to dynamical-mass ratio with tentative evidence for a dependance in X-ray
luminosity on HI morphology whereby systems with intragroup HI indicative of
strong interactions are considerably more X-ray luminous than passively
evolving groups. We also find a gap in the Lx of groups as a function of the
total group specific star formation rate. Our findings suggest that the hot gas
in these groups is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and these systems are not
low-mass analogs of rich groups or clusters, with the possible exception of HCG
62.

potential of a 2D screened hydrogenic atom. When two columns are in close
proximity, their bound states overlap and form analogs to molecular orbitals.
For sub-angstrom electron beams, excitation of anti-symmetric orbitals can
result in the failure of the simple incoherent imaging approximation. As a
result, the standard resolution test and the one-to-one correspondence of
atomic positions of a crystal imaged along a zone-axis with closely spaced
projected columns (""dumbbells"") can fail dramatically at finite and realistic
sample thicknesses. This is demonstrated experimentally in high angle annular
dark field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF STEM) images of
[211]-oriented Si showing an apparent inter-column spacing of 1.28(+-.09)
Angstroms, over 64% larger than the actual 0.78 Angstrom spacing. Furthermore,
the apparent spacing can be tuned with sample thickness and probe size to
produce a larger, smaller, or even the actual spacing under conditions when the
peaks of two adjacent Si columns should not even have been resolved given the
electron probe size.

Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) observations reveal this rich, co-spatial
population behind the foreground globular cluster 47 Tuc, which we targeted for
121 HST orbits. The stellar main sequence of the SMC is measured in the F606W,
F814W color-magnitude diagram (CMD) down to ~30th magnitude, and is cleanly
separated from the foreground star cluster population using proper motions. We
simulate the SMC population by extracting stellar masses (single and unresolved
binaries) from specific IMFs, and converting those masses to luminosities in
our bandpasses. The corresponding photometry for these simulated stars is drawn
directly from a rich cloud of 4 million artificial stars, thereby accounting
for the real photometric scatter and completeness of the data. Over a
continuous and well populated mass range of M = 0.37 - 0.93 Msun (i.e., down to
a ~75% completeness limit at F606W = 28.7), we demonstrate that the IMF is well
represented by a single power-law form with slope \alpha = -1.90
(^{+0.15}_{-0.10}) (3 sigma error) (i.e., dN/dM \propto M^{\alpha}). This is
shallower than the Salpeter slope of \alpha = -2.35, which agrees with the
observed stellar luminosity function at higher masses. Our results indicate
that the IMF does {\it not} turn over to a more shallow power-law form within
this mass range. We discuss implications of this result for the theory of star
formation, the inferred masses of galaxies, and the (lack of a) variation of
the IMF with metallicity.

~0.17"". On scales of 50-150 pc the spatial distribution and kinematics of the
molecular gas are consistent with a rotating thin disk, where the ratio of
rotation (V) to dispersion (sigma) exceeds unity. However, in the central 50
pc, the observations reveal a geometrically and optically thick structure of
molecular gas (V/sigma<1 and N_H>10^{23} cm^{-2}) that is likely to be
associated with the outer extent of any smaller scale obscuring structure. In
contrast to Seyfert galaxies, the molecular gas in LLAGN has a V/sigma<1 over
an area that is ~9 times smaller and column densities that are in average ~3
times smaller. We interpret these results as evidence for a gradual
disappearance of the nuclear obscuring structure. While a disk wind may not be
able to maintain a thick rotating structure at these luminosities, inflow of
material into the nuclear region could provide sufficient energy to sustain it.
In this context, LLAGN may represent the final phase of accretion in current
theories of torus evolution. While the inflow rate is considerable during the
Seyfert phase, it is slowly decreasing, and the collisional disk is gradually
transitioning to become geometrically thin. Furthermore, the nuclear region of
these LLAGN is dominated by intermediate-age/old stellar populations (with
little or no on-going star formation), consistent with a late stage of
evolution.

to address questions such as how state-dependent is the consistency relation
for the bispectrum, how many e-folds beyond the minimum required to solve the
cosmological fine tunings of the big bang are we allowed so that some
information from the initial state survives until late times, among others. We
find that the so-called consistency condition relating the local limit of the

be avoided for physically consistent initial states either with or without

has undergone a dramatic transition starting at ~500 d, with a sharp decline in
the X-ray flux by about a factor of 170 on a timescale of dt/t<0.2. The rapid
decline rules out a forward shock origin (direct or reprocessing) for the X-ray
emission at <500 d, and instead points to internal dissipation in the inner
jet. On the other hand, our radio data uniquely demonstrate that the low X-ray
flux measured by Chandra at ~610 d is consistent with emission from the forward
shock. Furthermore, the Chandra data are inconsistent with thermal emission
from the accretion disk itself since the expected temperature of 30-60 eV and
inner radius of 2-10 R_s cannot accommodate the observed flux level or the
detected emission at >1 keV. We associate the rapid decline with a turn off of
the relativistic jet when the mass accretion rate dropped below Mdot_Edd~0.006
Msun/yr (for a 3x10^6 Msun black hole and order unity efficiency) indicating
that the peak accretion rate was about 330 Mdot_Edd, and the total accreted
mass by 500 d is about 0.15 Msun. From the radio data we further find
significant flattening in the integrated energy of the forward shock at >250 d

following a rise by about a factor of 15 at 30-250 d. Projecting forward, we
predict that the emission in the radio and X-ray bands will evolve in tandem

photometry on WMAP data, centred on such superstructures identified from SDSS
LRGs, and find amplitudes at the level of 8 -- 11$ \mu$K -- thus confirming the
earlier work of Granett et al 2008. If we focus on apertures of the size
$\sim3.6\degr$, then our realisations indicate that LCDM is discrepant at the
level of $\sim4 \sigma$. If we combine all aperture scales considered, ranging
from 1\degr--20\degr, then the discrepancy becomes $\sim2\sigma$, and it
further lowers to $\sim 0.6 \sigma$ if only 30 superstructures are considered
in the analysis (being compatible with no ISW signatures at $1.3\sigma$ in this
case). Full-sky ISW maps generated from our N-body simulations show that this
discrepancy cannot be alleviated by appealing to Rees-Sciama mechanisms, since
their impact on the scales probed by our filters is negligible. We perform a
series of tests on the WMAP data for systematics. We check for foreground
contaminants and show that the signal does not display the correct dependence
on the aperture size expected for a residual foreground tracing the density
field. The signal also proves robust against rotation tests of the CMB maps,
and seems to be spatially associated to the angular positions of the supervoids

The model we study has a known graviational dual, which arises from a type IIB
D-brane configuration. It exhibits two dynamical scales, separated by a nearly
conformal region. Thus, it is of great interest for the study of walking in
gauge theories. By using the gravitational description, we are able to compute
analytically the glueball mass spectrum in a certain range of the parameter
space of the theory. Within that range, we do not find a light state that could
be associated with a slight breaking of conformal invariance. Finally, we show
that in this model there can be an order of magnitude hierarchy between the

chiral symmetry breaking, determined by the lowest vector-meson mass.

gravitational lensing surveys is the uncertainty introduced by the effects of
baryons on the power spectrum of the convergence field. One method that has
been proposed to account for these effects is to allow several additional
parameters (that characterize dark matter halos) to vary and to fit lensing
data to these halo parameters concurrently with the standard set of
cosmological parameters. We test this method. In particular, we use this
technique to model convergence power spectrum predictions from a set of
cosmological simulations. We estimate biases in dark energy equation of state
parameters that would be incurred if one were to fit the spectra predicted by
the simulations either with no model for baryons, or with the proposed method.
We show that neglecting baryonic effect leads to biases in dark energy
parameters that are several times the statistical errors for a survey like the
Dark Energy Survey. The proposed method to correct for baryonic effects renders
the residual biases in dark energy equation of state parameters smaller than
the statistical errors. These results suggest that this mitigation method may
be applied to analyze convergence spectra from a survey like the Dark Energy
Survey. For significantly larger surveys, such as will be carried out by the
Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, the biases introduced by baryonic effects are
much more significant. We show that this mitigation technique significantly
reduces the biases for such larger surveys, but that a more effective
mitigation strategy will need to be developed in order ensure that the residual
biases in these surveys fall below the statistical errors.

investigated experimentally and theoretically. As liquids, short chained
polystyrene (PS) and polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) are used, which can be
considered as Newontian liquids well above their glass transition temperatures.
Careful imaging of the PS/air interface of the droplets during equilibration by
\emph{in situ} scanning force microscopy and the PS/PMMA interface after
removal of the PS droplets reveal a surprisingly deep penetration of the PS
droplets into the PMMA layer. Droplets of sufficiently small volumes develop
the typical lens shape and were used to extract the ratio of the PS/air and
PS/PMMA surface tensions and the contact angles by comparison to theoretical
exact equilibrium solutions of the liquid/liquid system. Using these results in
our dynamical thin-film model we find that before the droplets reach their
equilibrium they undergo several intermediate stages each with a well-defined
signature in shape. Moreover, the intermediate droplet shapes are independent
of the details of the initial configuration, while the time scale they are
reached depend strongly on the droplet volume. This is shown by the numerical
solutions of the thin-film model and demonstrated by quantitative comparison to
experimental results.

of field-quadrature operators for nonequilibrium ultracold bosons in optical
lattices. The technique exploits the internal state structure of magnetic atoms
to create two subsystems of atoms in different spin states and lattice sites. A
Feshbach resonance turns off atom-atom interactions in one spin subsystem,
making it a well-characterized reference state, while atoms in the other
subsystem undergo nonequilibrium dynamics for a variable hold time. Interfering
the subsystems via a second beam-splitting operation, time-resolved quadrature
measurements on the interacting atoms are obtained by detecting relative spin
populations. The technique can provide quadrature measurements for a variety of
Hamiltonians and lattice geometries (e.g., cubic, honeycomb, superlattices),
including systems with tunneling, spin-orbit couplings using artificial gauge
fields, and higher-band effects. Analyzing the special case of a deep lattice
with negligible tunneling, we obtain the time evolution of both quadrature
observables and their fluctuations. As a second application, we show that the
interferometer can be used to measure atom-atom interaction strengths with
super-Heisenberg scaling n^(-3/2) in the mean number of atoms per lattice site
n, and standard quantum limit scaling M^(-1/2) in the number of lattice sites
M. In our analysis, we require M >> 1 and for realistic systems n is small, and
therefore the scaling in total atom number N = nM is below the Heisenberg
limit; nevertheless, measurements testing the scaling behaviors for
interaction-based quantum metrologies should be possible in this system.

identify some inaccuracies in the BPLS original approximations for two flux
rates, namely the adenine nucleotide translocator rate $J_{\rm ANT}$ and the
calcium uniporter rate $J_{\rm uni}$. We introduce new approximations for such
flux rates and then analyze some of the dynamical properties of the model. We
infer, from exhaustive numerical explorations, that the enhanced BPLS equations
have a unique attractor fixed point for physiologically acceptable ranges of
mitochondrial variables and respiration inputs, as one would indeed expect from
homeostasis. We determine, in the stationary regime, the dependence of the
mitochondrial variables on the respiration inputs, namely the cytosolic
concentration of calcium ${\rm Ca}_{\rm c}$ and the substrate fructose
1,6-bisphosphate FBP. The same dynamical effects of calcium and FBP saturations
reported for the original BPLS model are observed here. We find out, however, a
novel non-stationary effect which could be, in principle, physiologically
interesting: some response times of the model tend to increase considerably for
high concentrations of calcium and/or FBP. In particular, the larger the
concentrations of ${\rm Ca}_{\rm c}$ and/or FBP, the larger the necessary time

that nucleons are correlated by simply being confined within the same nucleus

without strong azimuthal angle dependence. Somewhat surprisingly, long-range
rapidity correlations (iii) and (iv) have exactly the same amplitudes along

the other one centered around \Delta \phi =0 (here \Delta \phi\ is the

non-flow correlations which are qualitatively different from jet correlations

outperform known independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) random codes in

stem from the ability to decode the sum of codewords (or messages) using
lattice codes at higher rates than possible with i.i.d. random codes. Here we
develop a novel lattice coding scheme for the Two-way Two-relay Channel: 1 <->
2 <-> 3 <-> 4, where Node 1 and 4 simultaneously communicate with each other
through two relay nodes 2 and 3. Each node only communicates with its
neighboring nodes. The key technical contribution is the lattice-based
achievability strategy, where each relay is able to remove the noise while
decoding the sum of several signals in a Block Markov strategy and then
re-encode the signal into another lattice codeword using the so-called
""Re-distribution Transform"". This allows nodes further down the line to again
decode sums of lattice codewords. This transform is central to improving the
achievable rates, and ensures that the messages traveling in each of the two
directions fully utilize the relay's power, even under asymmetric channel
conditions. All decoders are lattice decoders and only a single nested lattice
codebook pair is needed. The symmetric rate achieved by the proposed lattice
coding scheme is within 0.5 log 3 bit/Hz/s of the symmetric rate capacity.

interest, however, is not the full variety, but only the model space. Here we

suppression of the skylines by the OH suppression fibres, surprisingly GNOSIS
produced no significant reduction in the interline background and the
sensitivity of GNOSIS and IRIS2 is about the same as IRIS2. It is unclear
whether the lack of reduction in the interline background is due to physical
sources or systematic errors as the observations are detector noise-dominated.
OH suppression fibres could potentially impact ground-based astronomy at the
level of adaptive optics or greater. However, until a clear reduction in the

for applications, due to their lower anisotropies and ultrahigh upper critical
fields. In the past 4 years, great progress has been made in the fabrication of
iron-based superconducting wires and tapes using the powder-in-tube (PIT)
processing method, including main three types of 122, 11, and 1111 iron-based
parent compounds. In this article, an overview of the current state of
development of iron-based superconducting wires and tapes is presented. We
focus on the fabrication techniques used for 122 pnictide wires and tapes, with
an emphasis on their meeting the critical current requirements for making
high-performance conductors, such as a combination of using Ag sheath, addition
element and optimized heat treatment to realize high Jc, ex situ process
employed to reduce non-superconducting phases and to obtain a high relative
density, and a texture control to improve grain connectivity. Of particular
interest is that so far transport Jc values above 10^4 A/cm^2 at 4.2 K and 10 T
are obtained in 122 type tapes, suggesting that they are prospective candidates
for high-field applications. Finally, a perspective and future development of
PIT pnictide wires are also given.

conversion factor (alpha_co) and dust-to-gas ratio (DGR) in 26 nearby,
star-forming galaxies. We have simultaneously solved for alpha_co and DGR by
assuming that the DGR is approximately constant on kpc scales. With this
assumption, we can combine maps of dust mass surface density, CO integrated
intensity and HI column density to solve for both alpha_co and DGR with no
assumptions about their value or dependence on metallicity or other parameters.
Such a study has just become possible with the availability of high resolution
far-IR maps from the Herschel key program KINGFISH, 12CO J=(2-1) maps from the
IRAM 30m large program HERACLES and HI 21-cm line maps from THINGS. We use a
fixed ratio between the (2-1) and (1-0) lines to present our alpha_co results
on the more typically used 12CO J=(1-0) scale and show using literature
measurements that variations in the line ratio do not effect our results. In
total, we derive 782 individual solutions for alpha_co and DGR. On average,
alpha_co = 3.1 Msun pc^-2 (K km s^-1)^-1 for our sample with a standard
deviation of 0.3 dex. Within galaxies we observe a generally flat profile of
alpha_co as a function of galactocentric radius. However, most galaxies exhibit
a lower alpha_co in the central kpc---a factor of ~2 below the galaxy mean, on
average. In some cases, the central alpha_co value can be factors of 5 to 10
below the standard Milky Way (MW) value of alpha_co,MW =4.4 Msun pc^-2 (K km
s^-1)^-1. While for alpha_co we find only weak correlations with metallicity,
DGR is well-correlated with metallicity, with an approximately linear slope.
Finally, we present several recommendations for choosing an appropriate
alpha_co for studies of nearby galaxies.

models, which include cloud decks of sulfide and chloride condensates. We find
that the models with these previously neglected clouds can reproduce the energy
distributions of T9 to Y0 dwarfs quite well, other than near 5um where the
models are too bright. This is thought to be because the models do not include
departures from chemical equilibrium caused by vertical mixing, which would
enhance the abundance of CO, decreasing the flux at 5um. Vertical mixing also
decreases the abundance of NH_3, which would otherwise have strong absorption
features at 1.03um and 1.52um that are not seen in the Y0 WISEPC

a mass range of 5 - 15 M_Jupiter and ages around 5 Gyr. We suggest that WISEP

fluxes at K and W2 are too faint by 0.5 - 1.0 magnitudes. We will address this
discrepancy in our next generation of models, which will incorporate water
clouds and mixing.

correlation function (2PCF) of subsets of its CMASS sample, which includes
about 260,000 galaxies over ~3,300 sq. deg in the redshift range 0.43<z<0.7. To
minimize the selection effect on galaxy clustering, we construct well-defined
luminosity and color subsamples by carefully accounting for the CMASS galaxy
selection cuts. The 2PCF of the whole CMASS sample, if approximated by a
power-law, has a correlation length of r_0=7.93\pm0.06Mpc/h and an index of
\gamma=1.85\pm0.01. Clear dependences on galaxy luminosity and color are found
for the projected 2PCF in all redshift bins, with more luminous and redder
galaxies generally exhibiting stronger clustering and steeper 2PCF. The color
dependence is also clearly seen for galaxies within the red sequence,
consistent with the behavior of SDSS-II main sample galaxies at lower
redshifts. At a given luminosity (k+e corrected), no significant evolution of
the projected 2PCFs with redshift is detected for red sequence galaxies. We
also construct galaxy samples of fixed number density at different redshifts,
using redshift-dependent magnitude thresholds. The clustering of these galaxies
in the CMASS redshift range is found to be consistent with that predicted by
passive evolution. Our measurements of the luminosity and color dependence and
redshift evolution of galaxy clustering will allow for detailed modeling of the
relation between galaxies and dark matter halos and new constraints on galaxy
formation and evolution.

around a density bump, which is likely present in the transition region between
the active zone and dead zone of protoplanetary discs. Previous works suggest
that the vortices resulting from the RWI may facilitate planetesimal formation
and angular momentum transport. We consider discs threaded by a large-scale
poloidal magnetic field, with a radial field component at the disc surface.
Such field configurations may lead to the production of magnetic winds or jets.
In general, the magnetic field can affect the RWI even when it is sub-thermal
(plasma $\beta\sim 10$). For infinitely thin discs, the instability can be
enhanced by about 10 percent. For discs with finite thickness, with a radial
gradient of the magnetic field strength, the RWI growth rate can increase
significantly (by a factor of $\sim 2$) as the field approaches equipartition
($\beta \sim 1$). Our result suggests that the RWI can continue to operate in
discs that produce magnetic winds.

problem of channel capture by a secondary network that uses spectrum sensing to
determine the availability of the channel, and its impact on the primary
throughput. We integrate the notion of transmission slots in Bianchi's Markov
model with the physical time slots, to derive the transmission probability of
the secondary network as a function of its scan duration. This is used to
obtain analytical expressions for the throughput achievable by the primary and
secondary networks. Our analysis considers both saturated and unsaturated
networks. By performing a numerical search, the secondary network parameters
are selected to maximize its throughput for a given level of protection of the
primary network throughput. The theoretical expressions are validated using
extensive simulations carried out in the Network Simulator 2. Our results
provide critical insights into the performance and robustness of different
schemes for medium access by the secondary network. In particular, we find that
the channel captures by the secondary network does not significantly impact the
primary throughput, and that simply increasing the secondary contention window

slowing-down often observed for power systems on the threshold of blackout. We
also estimate the collapse probability/mean clearing time for the power system

activated receptors can trigger full cellular responses. Reasons for the

receptors to be the first to activate the cell. The competition decreases the
variability of the time to cellular activation, and hence results in a more
synchronous activation of cells. We argue that, in simple models, this
variability reduction does not necessarily interfere with the receptor
specificity to ligands achieved by the kinetic proofreading mechanism. Thus
cells can be activated accurately in time and specifically to certain signals.
We predict the minimum number of receptors needed to reduce the coefficient of
variation for the time to activation following binding of a specific ligand.
Further, we predict the maximum number of receptors so that the kinetic
proofreading mechanism still can improve the specificity of the activation.
These predictions fall in line with experimentally reported receptor numbers
for multiple systems.

X-ray spectroscopy. We use the Chianti atomic database to greatly expand the
number of transitions in the cooling function. Chianti only includes lines that
have atomic data computed by sophisticated methods. This limits the line list
to lower excitation, longer wavelength, transitions. We had previously included
lines from the Opacity Project database, which tends to include higher energy,
shorter wavelength, transitions. These were combined with various forms of the
g-bar approximation, a highly approximate method of estimating collision rates.
For several iron ions the two databases are almost entirely complementary. We
adopt a hybrid approach in which we use Chianti where possible, supplemented by
lines from the Opacity Project for shorter wavelength transitions. The total

indeed facilitate dark matter annihilation, but the most energetic photons can
carry little more than the rest energy of the dark matter particles to a

the black hole where relativistic effects are negligible. Therefore, any strong
gravitational potential could probe dark matter equally well, and an appeal to
black holes for facilitating such collisions is unnecessary.

studied in a controlled way. We explicitly consider two classes of theories,
gauge theories with a center symmetry, such as SU(N_c) gauge theory for
arbitrary N_c, and theories without a center symmetry, such as G_2 gauge
theory. The mechanism governing the phase transition is universal and valid for
all simple groups. The perturbative one-loop potential as well as
monopole-instantons generate attraction among the eigenvalues of the Wilson
line. This is counter-acted by neutral bions --- topological excitations which
generate eigenvalue repulsion for all simple groups. The transition is driven
by the competition between these three effects. We study the transition in more
detail for the gauge groups SU(N_c), N_c>2, and G_2. In the case of G_2, there
is no change of symmetry, but the expectation value of the Wilson line exhibits
a discontinuity. We also examine the effect of the theta-angle on the phase

follicles, require a constant flux of differentiated cells. These tissues are
maintained by a population of stem cells, which generate differentiated
progenies and self-renew. Asymmetric division of each stem cell into one stem
cell and one differentiated cell can accomplish both tasks. However, in
mammalian cycling tissues, some stem cells divide symmetrically into two
differentiated cells and are replaced by a neighbor that divides symmetrically
into two stem cells. Besides this heterogeneity in fate (population asymmetry),
stem cells also exhibit heterogenous proliferation-rates; in the long run,
however, all stem cells proliferate at the same average rate (equipotency). We
construct and simulate a mathematical model based on these experimental
observations. We show that the complex steady-state dynamics of
population-asymmetric stem cells reduces the rate of replicative aging of the
tissue --potentially lowering the incidence of somatic mutations and genetics
diseases such as cancer. Essentially, slow-dividing stem cells proliferate and
purge the population of the fast-dividing --older-- cells which had undertaken
the majority of the tissue-generation burden. As the number of slow-dividing
cells grows, their proliferation-rate increases, eventually turning them into
fast-dividers, which are themselves replaced by newly emerging slow-dividers.
Going beyond current experiments, we propose a mechanism for equipotency that
can potentially halve the rate of replicative aging. Our results highlight the
importance of a population-level understanding of stem cells, and may explain
the prevalence of population asymmetry in a wide variety of cycling tissues.

combiner of estimation information from different neighbors is regarded as
different strategies selection. We show that this graphical evolutionary game
framework is very general and can unify the existing adaptive network
algorithms. Based on this framework, as examples, we further propose two
error-aware adaptive filtering algorithms. Moreover, we use graphical
evolutionary game theory to analyze the information diffusion process over the
adaptive networks and evolutionarily stable strategy of the system. Finally,
simulation results are shown to verify the effectiveness of our analysis and

Proxima (also known as alpha Centauri C) separated from alpha Centauri (which
itself is a close binary A/B) by 15000 AU, challenges current theories of star
formation, because their separation can exceed the typical size of a collapsing
cloud core. Various hypotheses have been proposed to overcome this problem,
including the suggestion that ultra-wide binaries result from the dissolution
of a star cluster - when a cluster star gravitationally captures another,
distant, cluster star. Recent observations have shown that very wide binaries
are frequently members of triple systems and that close binaries often have a
distant third companion. Here we report Nbody simulations of the dynamical
evolution of newborn triple systems still embedded in their nascent cloud cores
that match observations of very wide systems. We find that although the triple
systems are born very compact - and therefore initially are more protected
against disruption by passing stars - they can develop extreme hierarchical
architectures on timescales of millions of years as one component is
dynamically scattered into a very distant orbit. The energy of ejection comes
from shrinking the orbits of the other two stars, often making them look from a
distance like a single star. Such loosely bound triple systems will therefore
appear to be very wide binaries.

co-existence lines. Thereafter, we perform phase-field simulations, the results
of which are in agreement with analytical predictions. The phase-field

the formation of tapered cementite along with an overall increase in the
transformation kinetics as compared to diffusion in austenite (only). Finally,
it is worth noting that the aim of present work is not to consider the

strategy of ""improved"" dynamics in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Remarkable
consequences are inferred at the heuristic level of effective dynamics: first,
consistency of the constraint algebra regarding the Hamiltonian and
diffeomorphism constraints fixes the improved quantization scheme to be of the
form reminiscent of the improved scheme in LQC which preserves scaling
invariance; second, consistency regarding two Hamiltonian constraints further
demands the inclusion of higher order holonomy corrections and fixes a ratio
factor of 2 for the improved scheme. It is suggested that the classical
singularity is resolved and replaced by a quantum bounce which bridges a
classical solution to another classical phase. However, the constraints violate
briefly during the bouncing period, indicating that one cannot make sense of
symmetry reduction by separating the degrees of freedom of the full theory into
spherical and non-spherical ones in the vicinity of the quantum bounce,
although the heuristic effective dynamics can still give a reliable
semiclassical description of large-scale physics. Particularly, for the
Schwarzschild solution in accordance with the Kruskal coordinates, revealing
insights lead us to conjecture the complete quantum extension of the

the number of excedances. It can be interpreted as the local $h$-polynomial, in
the sense of Stanley, of the barycentric subdivision of the simplex. Motivated
by this interpretation, we define a derangement polynomial for the even-signed
permutation group. The coefficients of this polynomial are nonnegative,
symmetric and unimodal. We show that they enumerate derangements in the
even-signed permutation group according to a notion of excedance, which is
analogous to the one introduced by Brenti for signed permutations. We also give
an explicit formula for the corresponding exponential generating function.

to the neutrino velocity measurement over a distance of 730 km. The OPERA
neutrino experiment at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory used an upgraded
setup compared to the 2011 measurements, improving the measurement time
accuracy. An independent timing system based on the Resistive Plate Chambers
was exploited providing a time accuracy of $\sim$1 ns. Neutrino and
anti-neutrino contributions were separated using the information provided by
the OPERA magnetic spectrometers. The new analysis profited from the precision
geodesy measurements of the neutrino baseline and of the CNGS/LNGS clock
synchronization. The neutrino arrival time with respect to the one computed
assuming the speed of light in vacuum is found to be $\delta t_\nu \equiv TOF_c
- TOF_\nu= (0.6 \pm 0.4\ (stat.) \pm 3.0\ (syst.))$ ns and $\delta

corresponds to a limit on the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed
of light of $-1.8 \times 10^{-6} < (v_{\nu}-c)/c < 2.3 \times 10^{-6}$ at 90%

the transmission range and the node location. We show that for each subregion,
the probability that a random node falls inside a disk centered at an arbitrary

Using the results for the different subregions, we obtain the exact probability
of node isolation and minimum node degree distribution that serves as an upper
bound for the probability of $k$-connectivity. Our theoretical framework is
validated by comparison with the simulation results and shows that the minimum
node degree distribution serves as a tight upper bound for the probability of

gravity coupled to a self-interacting real scalar field. The spatial part of
the metric of this solution is flat but the temporal part behaves
asymptotically like AdS space-time. The scalar field has logarithmic behavior
as one would expect for a massless scalar field in flat space-time. The
solution can be compared to gravitating scalar field solutions in 3+1
dimensions but with certain oddities connected with the 2+1 dimensional
character of the space-time. The solution is unique to 2+1 dimensions; it does
not carry over to 3+1 dimensions.

in the negative energy plane), we show that we need one Pietarinen series per

the development of widely available distributed computing platforms. The method
is applied to position and velocity consensus in a network of double

order to calibrate the methods that Gaia will use, e.g. stellar models or
GSP_phot. For solar-like stars (F, G, K IV/V), asteroseismic data delivers at
the least two very important quantities: (1) the average large frequency
separation <Delta_nu> and (2) the frequency corresponding to the maximum of the
modulated-amplitude spectrum nu_max. Both of these quantities are related
directly to stellar parameters (radius and mass) and in particular their
combination (gravity and density). We show how the precision in <Delta_nu>,
nu_max, and atmospheric parameters T_eff and [Fe/H] affect the determination of
gravity (log g) for a sample of well-known stars. We find that log g can be
determined within less than 0.02 dex accuracy for our sample while considering
precisions in the data expected for V<12 stars from Kepler data. We also derive
masses and radii which are accurate to within 1sigma of the accepted values.
This study validates the subsequent use of all of the available asteroseismic
data on main sequence solar-like stars from the Kepler field (>500 IV/V stars)
in order to provide a very important constraint for Gaia calibration of
GSP_phot through the use of log g. We note that while we concentrate on IV/V

spacetimes, we establish the existence of a global foliation by spacelike
hypersurfaces so that the time function coincides with the area of the surfaces
of symmetry and asymptotically approaches infinity in the expanding case and
zero in the contracting case. More precisely, the latter property in the
contracting case holds provided the mass density does not exceed a certain
threshold, which is a natural assumption since certain exceptional data with
sufficiently large mass density are known to give rise to a Cauchy horizon, on
which the area function attains a positive value. An earlier result by LeFloch

possibility of determining the neutrino mass hierarchy through earth matter
effects. Amongst the current accelerator-based experiments only NOvA has a long
enough baseline to observe earth matter effects. However, NOvA is plagued with
uncertainty on the knowledge of the true value of $\delta_{CP}$, and this could
drastically reduce its sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy. The earth
matter effect on atmospheric neutrinos on the other hand is almost independent
of $\delta_{CP}$. The 50 kton magnetized Iron CALorimeter at the India-based
Neutrino Observatory (ICAL@INO) will be observing atmospheric neutrinos. The
charge identification capability of this detector gives it an edge over others
for mass hierarchy determination through observation of earth matter effects.
We study in detail the neutrino mass hierarchy sensitivity of the data from
this experiment simulated using the Nuance based generator developed for
ICAL@INO and folded with the detector resolutions and efficiencies obtained by
the INO collaboration from a full Geant4-based detector simulation. The data
from ICAL@INO is then combined with simulated data from T2K, NOvA, Double

conditions in which the magnetic forces are accounted for and the induction
equation is satisfied. The local linear theory of the magnetorotational
instability (MRI) is used as a predictor of the growth of magnetic field
perturbations in the global simulations. The linear growth estimates and global
simulations diverge when non-linear motions - perhaps triggered by the onset of
turbulence - upset the velocity perturbations used to excite the MRI. The
saturated state is found to be independent of the initially excited MRI mode,
showing that once the disk has expelled the initially net flux field and
settled into quasi-periodic oscillations in the toroidal magnetic flux, the
dynamo cycle regulates the global saturation stress level. Furthermore,
time-averaged measures of converged turbulence, such as the ratio of magnetic
energies, are found to be in agreement with previous works. In particular, the
globally averaged stress normalized to the gas pressure, <\alpha_{\rm P}> =
0.034, with notably higher values achieved for simulations with higher
azimuthal resolution. Supplementary tests are performed using different
numerical algorithms and resolutions. Convergence with resolution during the
initial linear MRI growth phase is found for 23-35 cells per scaleheight (in
the vertical direction).

Multi-layer, multi-wavelength observational data were used for the analysis of
the emerging flux in this active region. Spectropolarimetric observations were
carried out with the telescope THEMIS on Tenerife (Canary Islands) on 4 July
2009. In addition, space-borne data from SOHO/MDI, STEREO and GOES were also
considered. The combination of data from ground- and space-based telescopes
allowed us to study the dynamics of the lower atmosphere of the active region
with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. THEMIS spectra show
strong temporal variations of the velocity in the chromosphere and photosphere
for different activity features: two pores, active and quiet plage regions, and
two surges. The range of variations of the chromospheric line-of-sight velocity
at the heights of formation of the H-alpha core was extremely large. Both
upward and downward motions were observed in these layers. In particular, a
surge with upward velocities up to -73 km/s were detected. In the photosphere,
predominantly upward motions were found, varying from -3.1 km/s upflows to 1.4
km/s downflows in different structures. The velocity variations at different
levels in the lower atmosphere are compatible with magnetic flux emergence.

frequent measurements. Here, we propose a scheme for entangling two given
photons based on this effect. We consider a linear-optics set-up with an
absorber medium whose two-photon absorption rate $\xi_{2\gamma}$ exceeds the
one-photon loss rate $\xi_{1\gamma}$. In order to reach an error probability
$P_{\rm error}$, we need $\xi_{1\gamma}/\xi_{2\gamma}<2P_{\rm error}^2/\pi^2$,
which is a factor of 64 better than previous approaches (e.g., by Franson et
al). Since typical media have $\xi_{2\gamma}<\xi_{1\gamma}$, we discuss three
mechanisms for enhancing two-photon absorption as compared to one-photon loss.
The first mechanism again employs the quantum Zeno effect via self-interference
effects when sending two photons repeatedly through the same absorber. The
second mechanism is based on coherent excitations of many atoms and exploits
the fact that $\xi_{2\gamma}$ scales with the number of excitations but
$\xi_{1\gamma}$ does not. The third mechanism envisages three-level systems
where the middle level is meta-stable ($\Lambda$-system). In this case,
$\xi_{1\gamma}$ is more strongly reduced than $\xi_{2\gamma}$ and thus it
should be possible to achieve $\xi_{2\gamma}/\xi_{1\gamma}\gg1$. In conclusion,
although our scheme poses challenges regarding the density of active
atoms/molecules in the absorber medium, their coupling constants and the
detuning, etc., we find that a two-photon gate with an error probability
$P_{\rm error}$ below 25% might be feasible using present-day technology.

Precursor, comprising 128 aperture array elements distributed over an area of 3
km diameter. The MWA is located at the extraordinarily radio quiet Murchison
Radioastronomy Observatory in the mid-west of Western Australia, the selected
home for the Phase 1 and Phase 2 SKA low frequency arrays. The MWA science
goals include: 1) detection of fluctuations in the brightness temperature of
the diffuse redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen from the epoch of
reionisation; 2) studies of Galactic and extragalactic processes based on deep,
confusion-limited surveys of the full sky visible to the array; 3) time domain
astrophysics through exploration of the variable radio sky; and 4) solar
imaging and characterisation of the heliosphere and ionosphere via propagation
effects on background radio source emission. This paper will focus on a brief
discussion of the as-built MWA system, highlighting several novel
characteristics of the instrument, and a brief progress report (as of June
2012) on the final construction phase. Practical completion of the MWA is
expected in November 2012, with commissioning commencing from approximately
August 2012 and operations commencing near mid 2013. A brief description of
recent science results from the MWA prototype instrument is given.

nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of the decays of these five nuclei, derived

five single mechanisms discussed, the NMEs for $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo

NMEs of any two nuclei not exceeding 10%, the NMEs for $^{136}Xe$ differ
significantly from those of $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}Se$, $^{100}$Mo and $^{130}$Te,

draw conclusions about the pair of non-interfering (interfering) mechanisms

Einstein-aether theory and the infrared limit of Horava-Lifshitz gravity which
was missed in our earlier derivation and drastically modifies our conclusion:
our earlier calculations (which are otherwise technically correct) do not
really imply that there are no slowly rotating black holes in Horava-Lifshitz
gravity, but that there are no slowly rotating black holes in the latter that
are also solutions of Einstein-aether theory and vice versa. That is, even
though the two theories share the static, spherically symmetric solutions,
there are no slowly rotating black holes that are solutions to both theories.
We proceed to generate slowly rotating black hole solutions in the infrared
limit of Horava-Lifshitz gravity, and we show that the configuration of the
foliation-defining scalar remains the same as in spherical symmetry, thus these
black holes are expected to posses a universal horizon.

the characteristics of the dust around the star. Our new CO and 13CO data allow
the low/intermediate density molecular gas surrounding the WR nebula to be
completely mapped. We report two molecular features at -5 km/s and -8.5 km/s
(component 1 and component 2, respectively) having a good morphological
resemblance with the Halpha emission of the ring nebula. Component 2 seems to
be associated with the external ring, whilst component 1 is placed at the
interface between component 2 and the Halpha emission. We also report a third
molecular feature 10' in size (component 3) at a velocity of -9.5 km/s having a
good morphological correspondence with the inner optical and IR emission,
although high resolution observations are recommended to confirm its existence.
The stratified morphology and kinematics of the molecular gas could be
associated to shock fronts and high mass-loss events related to different
evolutive phases of the WR star, which have acted upon the surrounding
circumstellar molecular gas. An analysis of the mass of component 1 suggests
that this feature is composed by swept-up interstellar gas and is probably
enriched by molecular ejecta. The direction of the proper motion of WR 16
suggests that the morphology of the inner ring nebula is induced by the stellar
motion.

show that the zero-padded single carrier (ZP-SC) SM system offers full

Thus, we show that the zero-padding in the SC SM system has two fold advantage

relatively low ML decoding complexity. Furthermore, we extend the partial
interference cancellation receiver (PIC-R) proposed by Guo and Xia for the
decoding of STBCs in order to convert the ZP-SC system into a set of
flat-fading subsystems. We show that the transmission of any full rank STBC
over these subsystems achieves full transmit, receive as well as multipath
diversity under PIC-R. With the aid of this extended PIC-R, we show that the

square root. Polynomial is a generalization of quadratic equation. If we define
solvability by using only square roots, cube roots etc, then polynomials are
not solvable by radicals (square root, cube root etc). We can classify
polynomials into simple (solvable by radicals) and complex (not solvable by
radicals). We will use the same metaphor to separate what is solvable (simple
part) and what is not solvable (complex part).
  This paper is a result of our presentation at a University of Houston
seminar. In this paper, we will study seismic complexity through the eyes of
solvability. We will investigate model complexity, data complexity and operator
complexity. Model complexity is demonstrated by multiple scattering in a
complex model like Cantor layers. Data complexity is studied through Betti
numbers (topology/cohomology). Data can be decomposed as simple part and
complex part. The simple part is solvable as an inverse problem. The complex
part could be studied qualitatively by topological method like Betti numbers.
Operator complexity is viewed through semigroup theory, specifically through
idempotents (opposite of group theory). Operators that form a group are
invertible (solvable) while semigroup of operators is not invertible (not
solvable) in general.

the vacuum structures and the phase structure for the lattice gauge theory with

determine the nonperturbative running coupling constant in this renormalization
scheme for the quenched QCD and Nf=12 SU(3) gauge theories. At first, we study
the quenched QCD theory using the plaquette gauge action. The TPL coupling
constant has a fake fixed point in the confinement phase. We discuss this fake
fixed point of the TPL scheme and obtain the nonperturbative running coupling
constant in the deconfinement phase, where the magnitude of the Polyakov loop
shows the nonzero values. We also investigate the system coupled to fundamental
fermions. Since we use the naive staggered fermion with the twisted boundary
condition in our simulation, only multiples of 12 are allowed for the number of
flavors. According to the perturbative two loop analysis, the Nf=12 SU(3) gauge
theory might have a conformal fixed point in the infrared region. However, the
recent lattice studies show controversial results for the existence of the
fixed point. We point out possible problems in previous works, and present our
careful study. Finally, we find the infrared fixed point (IRFP) and discuss the
robustness of the nontrivial IRFP of many flavor system under the change of the

that each pair of dots may be tuned independently of the other. The calculated

differences in the PAH line profiles also suggests that the molecules in the

word orthogonal frequency division multiplexing). In UW-OFDM the cyclic
prefixes (CPs) are replaced by deterministic sequences, the so-called unique
words (UWs). The UWs are generated by appropriately loading a set of redundant
subcarriers. By that a systematic complex number Reed Solomon (RS) code
construction is introduced in a quite natural way, because an RS code may be
defined as the set of vectors, for which a block of successive zeros occurs in
the other domain w.r.t. a discrete Fourier transform. (For a fixed block
different to zero, i.e., a UW, a coset code of an RS code is generated.) A
remaining problem in the original systematic coded UW-OFDM concept is the fact
that the redundant subcarrier symbols disproportionately contribute to the mean
OFDM symbol energy. In this paper we introduce the concept of non-systematic
coded UW-OFDM, where the redundancy is no longer allocated to dedicated
subcarriers, but distributed over all subcarriers. We derive optimum complex
valued code generator matrices matched to the BLUE (best linear unbiased
estimator) and to the LMMSE (linear minimum mean square error) data estimator,
respectively. With the help of simulations we highlight the advantageous
spectral properties and the superior BER (bit error ratio) performance of
non-systematic coded UW-OFDM compared to systematic coded UW-OFDM as well as to
CP-OFDM in AWGN (additive white Gaussian noise) and in frequency selective
environments.

interaction process with the help of the generalised effective potential method
and reveal the well-specified universal origin of change (emergence), time and
evolution in an a priori conservative, time-independent system. It appears
together with the universal dynamic complexity definition, where this unified
complexity conservation and transformation constitutes the essence of
evolution. We then consider the detailed structure of this universal
evolutionary process showing its step-wise, ""punctuated"" character, now
provided with the exact mathematical description. Comparing the expected
features of a revolutionary complexity transition near a step-like complexity
upgrade with the currently observed behaviour of world's social and economic
systems, we prove the necessity of complexity revolution towards the superior
civilisation level of well-defined nature, the only alternative being an
equally dramatic and irreversible degradation, irrespective of efforts applied
to stop the crisis at the current totally saturated complexity level.

space of a group of individuals is a simplicial complex whose topological
features are monitored in the process of opinion formation. The agents are
physically located on the nodes of the scale-free network. Social interactions
include all concepts of social dynamics present in the mainstream models
augmented by four additional interaction mechanisms which depend on the local
properties of opinions and their overlapping properties. The results pertaining
to the formation of consensus are of particular interest. An analogy with
quantum mechanical pure states is established through the application of the
high dimensional combinatorial Laplacian.

of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics. The basic difference is that the new
interpretation is formulated in the language of epistemological realism. It
involves a change in some basic physical concepts. Elementary particles are
considered as extended objects and nonlocal effects are included. The role of
the new concepts in the problem of measurement and of the
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations is described. Experiments to distinguish
the proposed interpretation from the Copenhagen one are pointed out.
