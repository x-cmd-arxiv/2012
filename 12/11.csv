on optimal compliance with the adiabatic following condition and are applicable
to a wide variety of systems. The first approach is an analytical one, based on
the assumption that the noise in the system is position independent. When
compared with the traditional approach, which requires constant deceleration,
for a typical system, we show an improvement of $\sim$ 10% in the maximal
capture velocity, allowing for a larger slower acceptance, or a reduction of
$sim$ 25% in slower length, allowing for a simpler design and a better
collimated beam. The second approach relies on an optimization of a system in
which the magnetic field and the noise profile are well known. As an example,
we use our 12-coil modular design and show an improvement of $sim$ 9% in
maximal capture velocity or, alternatively, a reduction of $\sim$ 33% in slower
length as compared with the traditional approach.

string coupling is sufficiently large, we show that such fluctuations are
likely to push a three-dimensional subspace to large volume where winding modes

Burgers turbulence, and extend it to decaying Navier-Stokes and
Surface-Quasi-Geostrophic turbulence. The method is based on a renormalized
small-time expansion, equivalent to a loop expansion, and naturally produces a
dissipative anomaly and a cascade after a finite time. We explicitly calculate
and analyze the one-loop FRG equations in the zero-viscosity limit as a
function of the dimension. For Burgers they reproduce the FRG equation obtained
in the context of random manifolds, extending previous results of one of us.
Breakdown of energy conservation due to shocks and the appearance of a direct
energy cascade corresponds to failure of dimensional reduction in the context
of disordered systems. For Navier-Stokes in three dimensions, the
velocity-velocity correlation function acquires a linear dependence on the
distance, zeta_2=1, in the inertial range, instead of Kolmogorov's zeta_2=2/3;
however the possibility remains for corrections at two- or higher-loop order.
In two dimensions, we obtain a numerical solution which conserves energy and
exhibits an inverse cascade, with explicit analytical results both for large
and small distances, in agreement with the scaling proposed by Batchelor. In
large dimensions, the one-loop FRG equation for Navier-Stokes converges to that
of Burgers.

approach uses robust optimization with recourse to determine operating rules

policies, establish several hours in advance how these entities are to respond
to errors in the prediction of loads and renewable infeeds once their values
are discovered. Affine policies consist of a nominal power schedule plus a
series of planned linear modifications that depend on the prediction errors
that will become known at future times. We describe how to choose optimal
affine policies that respect the power network constraints, namely matching
supply and demand, respecting transmission line ratings, and the local
operating limits of power system entities, for all realizations of the
prediction errors. Crucially, these policies are time-coupled, exploiting the
spatial and temporal correlation of these prediction errors. Affine policies
are compared with existing reserve operation under standard modelling
assumptions, and operating cost reductions are reported for a multi-day

such ""policy-based reserves"" are derived, and we propose new reserve products

generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To
illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the

portfolio selection as a sequential decision problem, and then survey a variety
of state-of-the-art approaches, which are grouped into several major
categories, including benchmarks, ""Follow-the-Winner"" approaches,
""Follow-the-Loser"" approaches, ""Pattern-Matching"" based approaches, and
""Meta-Learning Algorithms"". In addition to the problem formulation and related
algorithms, we also discuss the relationship of these algorithms with the
Capital Growth theory in order to better understand the similarities and
differences of their underlying trading ideas. This article aims to provide a
timely and comprehensive survey for both machine learning and data mining
researchers in academia and quantitative portfolio managers in the financial
industry to help them understand the state-of-the-art and facilitate their
research and practical applications. We also discuss some open issues and
evaluate some emerging new trends for future research directions.

The model includes an extra Higgs doublet with the vacuum expectation value

VEV is related to the origin of the small neutrino mass in the two Higgs
doublet model. In the model, a single non-standard model like Higgs production
of weak gauge boson fusion is suppressed due to the smallness of the vacuum
expectation value. In contrast to the single Higgs production, the cross
section of the Higgs pair production due to gauge boson fusion is not
suppressed. Using the model, we compute the charged Higgs and neutral Higgs
pair production cross section in W Z annihilation channel. In the two Higgs
doublet model, the charged Higgs H^+ decays into a pair of the charged
anti-lepton and right-handed neutrino. The neutral Higgs boson decays into
right-handed neutrino and left-handed anti-neutrino pair which is invisible. A
single charged anti-lepton and three neutrinos are the products of the
subsequent decays of the charged Higgs and the neutral Higgs. W Z pair
production gives the background for the signal through the decays W^+ ->nu l^+

realize many of their strategic goals (e.g., to improve sales, revenue,
customer experience etc.). However, many existing techniques commonly approach
these goals by seeking to recover preference (e.g., estimating ratings) in a
matrix completion framework. This paper aims to bridge this significant gap
between the clearly-defined strategic objectives and the not-so-well-justified
proxy.
  We show it is advantageous to think of a recommender system as an analogy to
a monopoly economic market with the system as the sole seller, users as the
buyers and items as the goods. This new perspective motivates a game-theoretic
formulation for recommendation that enables us to identify the optimal
recommendation policy by explicit optimizing certain strategic goals. In this
paper, we revisit and extend our prior work, the Collaborative-Competitive
Filtering preference model, towards a game-theoretic framework. The proposed
framework consists of two components. First, a conditional preference model
that characterizes how a user would respond to a recommendation action; Second,
knowing in advance how the user would respond, how a recommender system should
act (i.e., recommend) strategically to maximize its goals. We show how
objectives such as click-through rate, sales revenue and consumption diversity
can be optimized explicitly in this framework. Experiments are conducted on a
commercial recommender system and demonstrate promising results.

Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma orbital observatory is a four-year all-sky survey, in
the course of which the entire sky will be scanned eight times.
  Aims. We analyze the statistical properties of AGN and QSOs that are expected
to be detected in the course of the eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS).
  Methods. According to the currently planned survey strategy and based on the
parameters of the Galactic and extragalactic X-ray background as well as on the
results of the recent calculations of the eROSITA instrumental background, we
computed a sensitivity map of the eRASS. Using the best available
redshift-dependent AGN X-ray luminosity function (XLF), we computed various
characteristics of the eRASS AGN sample, such as their luminosity- and redshift
distributions, and the brightness distributions of their optical counterparts.
  Results. After four years of the survey, a sky-average sensitivity of
~1x10^(-14) erg/s/cm^2 will be achieved in the 0.5-2.0keV band. With this
sensitivity, eROSITA is expected to detect ~3 million AGN on the extragalactic
sky (|b|>10deg). The median redshift of the eRASS AGN will be z~1 with ~40% of
the objects in the z=1-2 redshift range. About 10^4 - 10^5 AGN are predicted
beyond redshift z=3 and about 2 000 - 30 000 AGN beyond redshift z=4, the exact
numbers depend on the poorly known behavior of the AGN XLF in the high-redshift
and luminosity regimes. Of the detected AGN, the brightest 10% will be detected
with more than ~38 counts per PSF HEW, while the faintest 10% will have fewer
than ~9 counts. The optical counterparts of ~95% of the AGN will be brighter
than I_(AB)=22.5mag. The planned scanning strategy will allow one to search for
transient events on a timescale of half a year and a few hours with a
0.5-2.0keV sensitivity of ~2x10^(-14) to ~2x10^(-13) erg/s/cm^2, respectively.

analyze the structural properties of an intrinsically multilayered real

hundreds of previously unknown Galactic regions of massive star formation by

they are located in previously unprobed zones of the Galactic disk. Here we
derive the properties of helium and carbon RRL emission from HRDS nebulae. Our
target sample is the subset of the HRDS that has visible helium or carbon RRLs.
This criterion gives a total of 84 velocity components (14% of the HRDS) with
helium emission and 52 (9%) with carbon emission. For our highest quality
sources, the average ionic He-4+/H+ abundance ratio by number, <y+>, is 0.068

previously known Galactic H II regions. Nebulae without detected helium
emission give robust y+ upper limits. There are 5 RRL emission components with
y+ less than 0.04 and another 12 with upper limits below this value. These H II
regions must have either a very low He-4 abundance or contain a significant
amount of neutral helium. The HRDS has 20 nebulae with carbon RRL emission but
no helium emission at its sensitivity level. There is no correlation between
the carbon RRL parameters and the 8 microns mid-infrared morphology of these

heavy quark mass limits of QCD in 1+1 dimension. In this non-relativistic
limit, baryons are composed of N_c quarks that interact, at leading order in
N_c, through a color Coulomb potential. Using variational techniques, very
accurate calculations of single baryon masses and interaction energies of
low-density baryon crystal are performed. These results are used to cross-check
a general numerical approach applicable for arbitrary quark masses and baryon
densities recently proposed by Bringoltz, which is based on a lattice in a
finite box with periodic boundary conditions. The Bringoltz method differs from
a previous approach of Salcedo, et al. in its treatment of a finite box effect
- namely gauge configurations that wind around the box. One might expect these
effects to be small for large enough boxes, in which the baryon density
approaches zero to high accuracy at the edges. However, the effects of these
windings appear to be quite large even in such boxes. The large mass infinite
volume calculations performed here are consistent with the results of numerical
calculations using the Bringoltz method. The calculation of the baryon crystal
interaction energy requires the assumption that at low-densities the ground
state is composed of individual baryons, each in a color-singlet state and
orthogonal to each other. This assumption is plausible but ad hoc in that one
can construct configurations in which the entire state is color-singlet but
cannot be broken into individual color-singlet baryons. The interaction energy
of low-density baryon crystals calculated with the assumption is consistent
with numerical results based on Bringoltz's approach suggesting that the
assumption is justified. This further supports a similar assumption that was
made in 3+1 dimensions, where no alternative means of calculation exist.

can happen and suddenly test their hypothesis. Recently, we presented some
disciplinary knots that arise usually in empirical investigation, according to
the Model of Educational Reconstruction and discussed methodological choices
made in designing the learning path and preliminary result about its
realization with few, interested and talented pupils. We report the second year
of this learning path performed with the same students that are introduced to
more complex topics such as analogy in wave phenomena and resonance.
Laboratories are described with particular attention for the energy
transformation. We designed the activities in order to propose a complementary
experience compared to what was done in class. Despite resonance is a relevant
phenomenon which runs through almost every branch of physics, many students
have never studied it. Yet, resonance is one of the most striking and
unexpected phenomenon in all physics and it easy to observe but difficult to
understand. Students performed activities in laboratory on several resonant
systems. Our purpose was to outline how it is possible to tune a system or a
device in order to obtain resonance and an efficient energy transfer from
different physical systems, such as a mechanical one and an electrical one.
This year, the final task was to analyze different natural phenomena in order
of choosing one suitable for energy transfer. We present our considerations on
the students' learning process and on the possibility of extend a similar path

powerful sampling technique called the multicanonical Monte Carlo method. Using
these methods, we estimate the numbers of the two dimensional N-step
self-avoiding walks up to N=256 with statistical errors. The developed methods
are based on statistical mechanical models of paths which include self-avoiding
walks. The criterion for selecting a suitable model for enumerating
self-avoiding walks is whether or not the configuration space of the model
includes a set for which the number of the elements can be exactly counted. We
call this set a scale fixing set. We selected the following two models which
satisfy the criterion: the Go model for lattice proteins and the Domb-Joyce
model for generalized random walks. There is a contrast between these two
models in the structures of the configuration space. The configuration space of
the Go model is defined as the universal set of self-avoiding walks, and the
set of the ground state conformation provides a scale fixing set. On the other
hand, the configuration space of the Domb-Joyce model is defined as the
universal set of random walks which can be used as a scale fixing set, and the
set of the ground state conformation is the same as the universal set of
self-avoiding walks. From the perspective of enumeration performance, we
conclude that the Domb-Joyce model is the better of the two. The reason for the
performance difference is partly explained by the existence of the first-order
phase transition of the Go model.

spontaneously breaks local supersymmetry with this field as the Goldstone

surrounding warped accretion disks in a frame of two different types of feeding
at the outer boundaries. We consider (1) fixed flows in which gas is
continually fed with a preferred angular momentum, and (2) free flows in which
there is no gas supply and the disks diffuse freely at their outer edges. As
expected, we find that for the cases of fixed flows the black hole disk systems
always end up aligning on timescales of several 1e6 yr, irrespective of the
initial inclinations. If the initial inclination angles are larger than pi/2,
the black hole accretion transits from retrograde to prograde fashion, and the
accreted mass onto the black holes during these two phases is comparable. On
the other hand, for the cases of free flows, both alignments and
anti-alignments can occur, depending on the initial inclinations and the ratios
of the angular momentum of the disks to that of the black holes. In such cases,
the disks will be consumed within timescales of 1e6 yr by black holes accreting
at the Eddington limit. We propose that there is a close connection between the
black hole spin and the lifetime for which the feeding persists, which
determines the observable episodic lifetimes of active galactic nuclei. We
conclude that careful inclusion of the disk feeding at the outer boundaries is
crucial for modeling the evolution of the black hole spin.

mergers, during which the black hole spins up, then switching to a period of

likely low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), although this number is a lower limit
due to the difficulties in separating LMXBs from background AGN. The X-ray

Quantifying the deviations in the waiting-time distribution away from one
generated by a random process, may help unravel the feedback mechanisms that
drive the underlying dynamics. We analyze the waiting-time distributions of
high frequency foreign exchange data for the best executable bid-ask prices
across all major currencies. We find that the lognormal distribution yields a
good overall fit for the waiting-time distribution between currency rate
changes if both short and long waiting times are included. If we restrict our
study to long waiting-times, each currency pair's distribution is consistent
with a power law tail with exponent near to 3.5. However for short waiting
times, the overall distribution resembles one generated by an archetypal
complex systems model in which boundedly rational agents compete for limited
resources. Our findings suggest a gradual transition arises in trading behavior
between a fast regime in which traders act in a boundedly rational way, and a
slower one in which traders' decisions are driven by generic feedback
mechanisms across multiple timescales and hence produce similar power-law tails
irrespective of currency type.

spectral line diagnostics that are sensitive to both temperature variations and
the presence of small scale unresolved magnetic features in these areas of the

density of three parameters describing the shape of two magnetically sensitive
FeI lines, at 630.2 nm and 617.3 nm, namely the line core intensity (IC), full

analyze observations of active region NOAA 11172, acquired with IBIS at the
Dunn Solar Telescope, as well as results from numerical synthesis. Our results
show that IC is sensitive to both temperature and magnetic flux density
variations, FWHM is mostly affected by magnetic field changes, and EQW is
mostly sensitive to temperature. Variations of a few percent of the measured
line parameters are found in observational data that was spatially degraded to
represent quiet-Sun, disk-centre, medium resolution observations. It is
therefore possible to disentangle magnetic from pure thermodynamic effects by
comparison of temporal variations of the EQW and the FWHM of either the two FeI

an isolated singularity, we show that the cohomology of intersection spaces is
the hypercohomology of a perverse sheaf, the intersection space complex, on the

For a large class of singularities, e.g., weighted homogeneous ones, global
Poincar\'e duality is induced by a more refined Verdier self-duality
isomorphism for this perverse sheaf. For such singularities, we prove
furthermore that the pushforward of the constant sheaf of a nearby smooth
deformation under the specialization map to the singular space splits off the
intersection space complex as a direct summand. The complementary summand is
the contribution of the singularity. Thus, we obtain for such hypersurfaces a

  exposition of Wahlquist-Estabrook prolongation algebras",,,,"nlin.SI math-ph math.MP math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For any (1+1)-dimensional (multicomponent) evolution PDE, we define a
sequence of Lie algebras $F^p$, $p=0,1,2,3,...$, which are responsible for all
Lax pairs and zero-curvature representations (ZCRs) of this PDE.
  In our construction, jets of arbitrary order are allowed. In the case of
lower order jets, the algebras $F^p$ generalize Wahlquist-Estabrook
prolongation algebras.
  To achieve this, we find a normal form for (nonlinear) ZCRs with respect to
the action of the group of gauge transformations. One shows that any ZCR is
locally gauge equivalent to the ZCR arising from a vector field representation
of the algebra $F^p$, where $p$ is the order of jets involved in the $x$-part
of the ZCR.
  More precisely, we define a Lie algebra $F^p$ for each nonnegative integer
$p$ and each point $a$ of the infinite prolongation $E$ of the evolution PDE.
So the full notation for the algebra is $F^p(E,a)$.
  Using these algebras, one obtains a necessary condition for two given
evolution PDEs to be connected by a Backlund transformation.
  In this paper, the algebras $F^p(E,a)$ are computed for some PDEs of KdV
type. In a different paper with G. Manno, we compute $F^p(E,a)$ for
multicomponent Landau-Lifshitz systems of Golubchik and Sokolov. Among the
obtained Lie algebras, one encounters infinite-dimensional algebras of certain
matrix-valued functions on some algebraic curves. Besides, some solvable ideals
and semisimple Lie algebras appear in the description of $F^p(E,a)$.
  Applications to classification of KdV and Krichever-Novikov type equations
with respect to Backlund transformations are also briefly discussed.

characterized by a non-trivial topology of its band structure. Its key feature
is conducting edge channels whose spin polarization has potential for
spintronic and quantum information applications. The QSH state was predicted
and experimentally demonstrated to exist in HgTe quantum wells. The existence
of the edge channels has been inferred from the fact that local and non-local
conductance values in sufficiently small devices are close to the quantized
values expected for ideal edge channels and from signatures of the spin
polarization. The robustness of the edge channels in larger devices and the
interplay between the edge channels and a conducting bulk are relatively
unexplored experimentally, and are difficult to assess via transport

the current flows along the edge of the device in the QSH regime, and

Iax), consisting of SNe observationally similar to its prototypical member, SN
2002cx. The class currently has 25 members, and we present optical photometry
and/or optical spectroscopy for most of them. SNe Iax are spectroscopically
similar to SNe Ia, but have lower maximum-light velocities (2000 < |v| < 8000
km/s), typically lower peak magnitudes (-14.2 > M_V,peak > -18.9 mag), and most
have hot photospheres. Relative to SNe Ia, SNe Iax have low luminosities for
their light-curve shape. There is a correlation between luminosity and
light-curve shape, similar to that of SNe Ia, but offset from that of SNe Ia
and with larger scatter. Despite a host-galaxy morphology distribution that is
highly skewed to late-type galaxies without any SNe Iax discovered in
elliptical galaxies, there are several indications that the progenitor stars
are white dwarfs (WDs): evidence of C/O burning in their maximum-light spectra,
low ejecta masses, strong Fe lines in their late-time spectra, a lack of X-ray
detections, and deep limits on massive stars and star formation at the SN
sites. However, two SNe Iax show strong He lines in their spectra. The
progenitor system and explosion model that best fits all of the data is a
binary system of a C/O WD that accretes matter from a He star and has a
significant deflagration. At least some of the time, this explosion will not
disrupt the WD. We estimate that in a given volume there are 31^+17_-13 SNe Iax
for every 100 SNe Ia, and for every 1 M_sun of iron generated by SNe Ia at z =
0, SNe Iax generate 0.052^+0.017_-0.014 M_sun. Being the largest class of
peculiar SNe, thousands of SNe Iax will be discovered by LSST. Future detailed
observations of SNe Iax should further our understanding of both their
progenitor systems and explosions as well as those of SNe Ia.

factors are compared both with those obtained using the same truncation but an
interaction that preserves the one-loop renormalisation-group behaviour of QCD

form factors that are typically harder than those obtained with QCD

a Ward identity for the inhomogeneous scalar vertex, similarity between the

Measurements of time lags (characterised by lag spectra) between variability in
the light curves in energy bands corresponding to directly observed continuum
emission from the corona around the black hole and to X-rays reflected from the
accretion disc adds a further dimension to studies of the structure and
energetics of these systems. We seek to understand these measurements in terms
of the physical parameters of the X-ray source (its location, extent, etc.)
through the calculation of theoretical lag spectra for a range of source
parameters in general relativistic ray tracing simulations, combined with
knowledge of the observed variability of the X-ray emission from AGN. Due to
the proximity of the emission to the central black hole, Shapiro delays are
important and the effects of general relativity should be considered when
interpreting the lags as the light travel time between the source and
reflector. We show that it is important to consider dilution of the lag by the
contribution of both the primary and reflected spectral components to the
observed energy bands. We find that the observed lag spectrum of the narrow
line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0707-495 implies an X-ray source extending radially
outwards to around 35rg and at a height of around 2rg above the plane of the
accretion disc, consistent with the constraints obtained independently by
considering the emissivity profile of the accretion disc. By investigating the
influence of the propagation of X-ray luminosity fluctuations through the
source region we find it is possible to reproduce the shape of the low
frequency part of the lag spectrum (where the hard 'primary' band lags behind
the soft 'reflected' band) as the effect of luminosity fluctuations originating
in the centre of the X-ray source, close to the black hole, and propagating
outwards.

intrinsic quantum uncertainty on a single observable is ineludible in a number

the density inside and outside the void region as well as its radius. It can be
many times larger than the Newtonian force and their ratio is in principle
unbound. This is very different from the case in halos, where the fifth force
is no more than 1/3 of gravity. The evolution of voids is governed by the
Newtonian gravity, the effective dark energy force and the fifth force. While
the first two forces are common in both LCDM and chameleon universes, the fifth
force is unique to the latter. Driven by the outward-pointing fifth force,
individual voids in chameleon models expand faster and grow larger than in a
LCDM universe. The expansion velocity of the void shell can be 20% to 30%
larger for voids of a few Mpc/h in radius, while their sizes can be larger by
~10%. These differences are smaller for larger voids of the same density. We
compare void statistics using excursion set theory; for voids of the same size,
their number density is larger in chameleon models. The fractional difference
increases with void size. The chance of having voids of radius ~25 Mpc/h can be
2.5 times larger. This difference is about 10 times larger than that in the
halo mass function. We find strong environmental dependence of void properties
in chameleon models. The differences in size and expansion velocity with GR are
both larger for small voids in high density regions. In general, the difference
between chameleon models and LCDM in void properties (size, expansion velocity
and distribution function) are larger than the corresponding quantities for
halos. This suggests that voids might be better candidates than halos for
testing gravity.

instrument to test the effectiveness of different AGN/SF diagnostics at z~1.5.
MOSFIRE spectra were obtained in three H-band multi-slit masks in the GOODS-S
field, resulting in two hour exposures of 36 emission-line galaxies. We compare
X-ray data with the traditional emission-line ratio diagnostics and the
alternative mass-excitation and color-excitation diagrams, combining new
MOSFIRE infrared data with previous HST/WFC3 infrared spectra (from the 3D-HST
survey) and multiwavelength photometry. We demonstrate that a high [OIII]/Hb
ratio is insufficient as an AGN indicator at z>1. For the four X-ray detected
galaxies, the classic diagnostics ([OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha and [SII]/Ha) remain
consistent with X-ray AGN/SF classification. The X-ray data also suggest that
""composite"" galaxies (with intermediate AGN/SF classification) host bona-fide
AGNs. Nearly 2/3 of the z~1.5 emission-line galaxies have nuclear activity
detected by either X-rays or the classic diagnostics. Compared to the X-ray and
line ratio classifications, the mass-excitation method remains effective at
z>1, but we show that the color-excitation method requires a new calibration to
successfully identify AGNs at these redshifts.

show that in the region where the mass of $Z'$ is between 80 and 400 GeV, the

the known monojet and dijet constraints. Searches in these channels can be
complementary to the monojet search, in particular if the $Z'$ couplings to
quarks ($g_{Z'}$) and dark matter ($g_D$) are different. For $g_D < g_{Z'}$, we
show that there is a larger region of parameter space which has correct thermal

cannot be covered by the mono-jet search, can be covered by the resonance

the abundance of molecular hydrogen. Modeling this empirical relation from
first principles proves challenging, however, and many questions regarding its
properties remain open. For instance, the exact functional form of the relation
is still debated and it is also unknown whether it applies at z>4, where CO
observations are sparse. Here, we analyze how the shape of the star formation
-- gas relation affects the cosmic star formation history and global galaxy
properties using an analytic model that follows the average evolution of
galaxies in dark matter halos across cosmic time. We show that a linear
relation with an H2 depletion time of ~2.5 Gyr, as found in studies of nearby
galaxies, results in good agreement with current observations of galaxies at
both low and high redshift. These observations include the evolution of the
cosmic star formation rate density, the z~4-9 UV luminosity function, the
evolution of the mass -- metallicity relation, the relation between stellar and
halo mass, and the gas-to-stellar mass ratios of galaxies. In contrast, the
short depletion times that result from adopting a highly super-linear star
formation -- gas relation lead to large star formation rates, substantial metal
enrichment (~0.1 solar), and low gas-to-stellar mass ratios already at z~10, in
disagreement with observations. These results can be understood in terms of an
equilibrium picture of galaxy evolution in which gas inflows, outflows, and
star formation drive the metallicities and gas fractions toward equilibrium
values that are determined by the ratio of the accretion time to the gas
depletion time. In this picture, the cosmic modulation of the accretion rate is
the primary process that drives the evolution of stellar masses, gas masses,
and metallicities of galaxies from high redshift until today.

Adaptive optics observations with NACO are used as an independent verification
of PRIMA astrometric observations. The PRIMA facility was used to carry out
tests of astrometric observations. The astrometric performance in terms of
precision is limited by the atmospheric turbulence at a level close to the
theoretical expectations and a precision of 30 micro-arcseconds was achieved.
In contrast, the astrometric accuracy is insufficient for the goals of the
ESPRI project and is currently limited by systematic errors that originate in
the part of the interferometer beamtrain which is not monitored by the internal
metrology system. Our observations led to the definition of corrective actions
required to make the facility ready for carrying out the ESPRI search for

most useful data for some purpose. In practical circumstances where experiments
are time-consuming or resource-intensive, OED can yield enormous savings. We
pursue OED for nonlinear systems from a Bayesian perspective, with the goal of
choosing experiments that are optimal for parameter inference. Our objective in
this context is the expected information gain in model parameters, which in
general can only be estimated using Monte Carlo methods. Maximizing this
objective thus becomes a stochastic optimization problem.
  This paper develops gradient-based stochastic optimization methods for the
design of experiments on a continuous parameter space. Given a Monte Carlo
estimator of expected information gain, we use infinitesimal perturbation
analysis to derive gradients of this estimator. We are then able to formulate
two gradient-based stochastic optimization approaches: (i) Robbins-Monro
stochastic approximation, and (ii) sample average approximation combined with a
deterministic quasi-Newton method. A polynomial chaos approximation of the
forward model accelerates objective and gradient evaluations in both cases. We
discuss the implementation of these optimization methods, then conduct an
empirical comparison of their performance. To demonstrate design in a nonlinear
setting with partial differential equation forward models, we use the problem
of sensor placement for source inversion. Numerical results yield useful
guidelines on the choice of algorithm and sample sizes, assess the impact of
estimator bias, and quantify tradeoffs of computational cost versus solution
quality and robustness.

the combination of two particles to form a third. The kinetics can be
represented by population rate equations based on a mean field assumption,
according to which the rate of aggregation is taken to be proportional to the
product of the mean populations of the two participants. This can be a poor
approximation when the mean populations are small. However, using the Poisson
representation it is possible to derive a set of rate equations that go beyond
mean field theory, describing pseudo-populations that are continuous, noisy and
complex, but where averaging over the noise and initial conditions gives the
mean of the physical population. Such an approach is explored for the simple
case of a size-independent rate of coagulation between particles. Analytical
results are compared with numerical computations and with results derived by
other means. In the numerical work we encounter instabilities that can be
eliminated using a suitable 'gauge' transformation of the problem [P. D.
Drummond, Eur. Phys. J. B38, 617 (2004)] which we show to be equivalent to the
application of the Cameron-Martin-Girsanov formula describing a shift in a
probability measure. The cost of such a procedure is to introduce additional
statistical noise into the numerical results, but we identify an optimised
gauge transformation where this difficulty is minimal for the main properties
of interest. For more complicated systems, such an approach is likely to be
computationally cheaper than Monte Carlo simulation.

use `provenance views' to hide carefully chosen subsets of data over all

each input x, the module's output f(x) is indistinguishable from G -1 other
possible values given the visible data in the workflow executions. We show that
G-privacy cannot be achieved simply by combining solutions for individual
private modules; data hiding must also be `propagated' through public modules.
We then examine how much additional data must be hidden and when it is safe to
stop propagating data hiding. The answer depends strongly on the workflow
topology as well as the behavior of public modules on the visible data. In
particular, for a class of workflows (which include the common tree and chain
workflows), taking private solutions for each private module, augmented with a
`public closure' that is `upstream-downstream safe', ensures G-privacy. We
define these notions formally and show that the restrictions are necessary. We

fundamentally determined by the microscopic state of the macroscopic

variable which, in contrast with variables characterizing the measured
microscopic system, is shown to lead to a violation of Bell's inequalities and
to agree with standard quantum mechanics. An explicit realization of this
interpretation is proposed for a primitive model of measurement apparatus
inspired by Mott: in the case of an alpha-particle spherical-wave detection in
a cloud chamber, the direction of the observed linear track is conjectured to
be determined by the position of the atoms of the gas filling the chamber.
Using a stationary-state coupled-channel Born expansion, a reduction of the

due to scattering on the chamber atoms. Being highly non local, this
interpretation of quantum mechanics is finally argued to open the way to

not yet been involved and the axiomatization of constructors over Logic LTSs is
absent. This paper tries to develop L\""{u}ttgen and Vogler's work along this
direction. We will present a process calculus for Logic LTSs (CLL, for short).
The language CLL is explored in detail from two different but equivalent views.
Based on behavioral view, the notion of ready simulation is adopted to
formalize the refinement relation, and the behavioral theory is developed.
Based on proof-theoretic view, a sound and ground-complete axiomatic system for
CLL is provided, which captures operators in CLL through (in)equational laws.

their material parameters, thus requiring reliable and nondestructive

Important material parameters to know are the resistivity, superconducting
transition temperature, relaxation time of quasiparticles, and uniformity of
patterned wires. In this work, we characterize micro-patterned thin NbN films
by using transport measurements in magnetic fields. We show that from the
instability of vortex motion at high currents in the flux-flow state of the
$IV$ characteristic, the inelastic life time of quasiparticles can be
determined to be about 2 ns. Additionally, from the depinning transition of
vortices at low currents, as a function of magnetic field, the size
distribution of grains can be extracted. This size distribution is found to be
in agreement with the film morphology obtained from scanning electron
microscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images.

the community of biomedical engineering due to its important applications in
medicine. In this work, a simple yet effective bag-of-words representation that
is able to capture both local and global structure similarity information is
proposed for biomedical time series representation. In particular, similar to
the bag-of-words model used in text document domain, the proposed method treats
a time series as a text document and extracts local segments from the time
series as words. The biomedical time series is then represented as a histogram
of codewords, each entry of which is the count of a codeword appeared in the
time series. Although the temporal order of the local segments is ignored, the
bag-of-words representation is able to capture high-level structural
information because both local and global structural information are well
utilized. The performance of the bag-of-words model is validated on three
datasets extracted from real EEG and ECG signals. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method is not only insensitive to parameters of
the bag-of-words model such as local segment length and codebook size, but also
robust to noise.

uncertainties, paying proper attention to non-factorizable terms.
  A central point is the systematic exploitation of the V-A structure of SM
weak interactions, which leads to the suppression of two helicity amplitudes
and some of the angular coefficients. We review how this works at the level of
(helicity) form factors, and show that the hierarchies extend to
non-factorizable terms. For virtual charm effects, we give an argument for it
in terms of light-cone QCD sum rules that continues to hold at the level of
""long-distance"" Lambda_QCD^2/m_c^2 power corrections, reducing an important
source of theoretical uncertainty in any \bar B, \bar B_s -> V l^+ l^- (or \bar
B -> V gamma) decay. The contributions of the remaining hadronic weak
Hamiltonian respect a similar hierarchy. We employ a resonance model to
preclude (in the \bar B -> \bar K^* case) large long-distance corrections to
this.
  A phenomenological part pays particular attention to the region of lowest
dilepton mass, 4 m_l^2 <= q^2 <= 2 GeV^2. Two observables remain theoretically
clean, implying a (theoretical) sensitivity to the real (imaginary) part of the
""right-handed"" Wilson coefficient C_7' to 10% (1%) of C_7^SM, both in the
muonic and the electronic mode. We also show that there are two near-exact

in 1949, the instant form and the front form can be interpolated by introducing
an interpolation angle between the ordinary time $t$ and the light-front time
$(t+z/c)/\sqrt{2}$. Using this method, we introduce the interpolating
scattering amplitude that links the corresponding time-ordered amplitudes
between the two forms of dynamics and provide the physical meaning of the
kinematic transformations as they allow the invariance of each individual
time-ordered amplitude for an arbitrary interpolation angle. In particular, it
exhibits that the longitudinal boost is kinematical only in the front form
dynamics, or the light-front dynamics (LFD), but not in any other interpolation
angle dynamics. It also shows that the disappearance of the connected
contributions to the current arising from the vacuum occurs when the
interpolation angle is taken to yield the LFD. Since it doesn't require the
infinite momentum frame (IMF) to show this disappearance and the proof is
independent of reference frames, it resolves the confusion between the LFD and
the IMF. The well-known utility of IMF usually discussed in the instant form
dynamics is now also extended to any other interpolation angle dynamics using
our interpolating scattering amplitudes.

the cometary samples returned to Earth by NASA's Stardust spacecraft. We
present an experimental study on the destruction of zwitterionic glycine

destruction rates of the alpha-glycine and beta-glycine crystals on bombardment
fluence is investigated. The samples were analyzed in situ by FTIR spectrometry
at different proton fluences at under ultrahigh vacuum conditions at the Van de
Graaff accelerator lab at PUC-Rio, Brazil. The dissociation cross section of
alpha-glycine was observed to be 2.5E-14 cm^-2, a value roughly 5 times higher
than the dissociation cross section found for beta-glycine. The estimated
half-lives of alpha-glycine and beta-glycine forms extrapolated to the Earth
orbit environment are 9E5 and 4E6 years, respectively. In the diffuse
interstellar medium the estimated values are 1 order of magnitude lower. These
results suggest that pristine interstellar beta-glycine is the one most likely
to survive the hostile environments of space radiation. A small feature around
1650-1700 cm^-1, tentatively attributed to an amide functional group, was
observed in the IR spectra of irradiated samples, suggesting that cosmic rays
may induce peptide bond synthesis in glycine crystals. Combining this finding
with the fact that this form has the highest solubility among the other glycine
polymorphs, we suggest that beta-glycine is the one most likely to have
produced the first peptides on primitive Earth.

the SR. The frequency dependence of the SNR exhibits a peak at a frequency

contexts, and prove that \'etale stacks may be characterized categorically as
those stacks that arise as prolongations of stacks on a site of spaces and
local homeomorphisms. Moreover, we show that the bicategory of \'etale
differentiable stacks and local diffeomorphisms is equivalent to the 2-topos of
stacks on the site of smooth manifolds and local diffeomorphisms. An analogous
statement holds for other flavors of manifolds (topological, $C^k,$ complex,
super...), and topological spaces locally homeomorphic to a given space $X.$ A
slight modification of this result also holds in an even more general context,
including all \'etale topological stacks, and Zariski \'etale stacks, and we
also sketch a proof of an analogous characterization of Deligne-Mumford
algebraic stacks. We go on to characterize effective \'etale stacks as
precisely those stacks arising as the prolongations of sheaves. It follows that
\'etale stacks (and in particular orbifolds) induce a small gerbe over their
effective part, and all gerbes over effective \'etale stacks arise in this way.
As an application, we show that well known Lie groupoids arising in foliation
theory give presentations for certain moduli stacks. For example, there exists
a classifying stack for Riemannian metrics, presented by Haefliger's groupoid
$R\Gamma$ and submersions into this stack classify Riemannian foliations, and
similarly for symplectic structures, with the role of $R\Gamma$ replaced with
$\Gamma^{Sp}.$ We also prove some unexpected results, for example: the category
of smooth $n$-manifolds and local diffeomorphisms has binary products.

the property of higher moment excitation functions are significantly dependent

hydrodynamical simulations of gas discs embedded in isolated early-type and
spiral galaxies. Despite using a universal local law to form stars in the
simulations, we find that the early-type galaxies are offset from the spirals
on the large-scale Kennicutt relation, and form stars 2 to 5 times less
efficiently. This offset is in agreement with previous results on morphological
quenching: gas discs are more stable against star formation when embedded in
early-type galaxies due to the lower disc self-gravity and increased shear. As
a result, these gas discs do not fragment into dense clumps and do not reach as
high densities as in the spiral galaxies. Even if some molecular gas is
present, the fraction of very dense gas (above 10^4 cm-3) is significantly
reduced, which explains the overall lower star formation efficiency. We also
analyse a sample of local early-type and spiral galaxies, measuring their CO
and HI surface densities and their star formation rates as determined by their
non-stellar 8um emission. As predicted by the simulations, we find that the
early-type galaxies are offset from the Kennicutt relation compared to the
spirals, with a twice lower efficiency. Finally, we validate our approach by
performing a direct comparison between models and observations. We run a
simulation designed to mimic the stellar and gaseous properties of NGC524, a
lenticular galaxy, and find a gas disc structure and global star formation rate
in good agreement with the observations. Morphological quenching thus seems to
be a robust mechanism, and is also consistent with other observations of a
reduced star formation efficiency in early-type galaxies in the COLD GASS

formation of the whole Red Sequence, but can contribute to the reddening of

binary parameters of recurrent novae have been well determined, especially for
the ones with frequent outbursts, U Sco and RS Oph, which provide useful
information on the elementary processes in binary evolution toward SNe Ia.
Therefore we use them as testbeds for binary evolution models. For example, the

novae, whereas the new single degenerate (SD) scenario proposed by Hachisu et

large-scale structure in the universe including nonzero spatial curvature and a
cosmological constant. In particular, we use the Goode and Wainwright
formulation, as in this form the models can be considered to represent exact
nonlinear perturbations of an averaged background. We identify a density
contrast in both classes I and II of the models, for which we derive growth
evolution equations. By including Lambda, the time evolution of the density
contrast as well as kinematic quantities can be tracked through the matter- and
Lambda-dominated cosmic eras up to the present and into the future. In various
models of class I and class II, the growth rate is found to be stronger than
that of the LCDM cosmology, and it is suppressed at later times due to the
presence of Lambda. We find that there are Szekeres models able to provide a
growth history similar to that of LCDM while requiring less matter content and
nonzero curvature, which speaks to the importance of including the effects of
large-scale inhomogeneities in analyzing the growth of large-scale structure.
Using data for the growth factor f from redshift space distortions and the
Lyman-alpha forest, we obtain best fit parameters for class II models and
compare their ability to match observations with LCDM. We find that there is
negligible difference between best fit Szekeres models with no priors and those
for LCDM, both including and excluding Lyman-alpha data. We also find that the
growth index gamma parametrization cannot be applied in a simple way to the
growth in Szekeres models, so a direct comparison of the function f to the data
is performed. We conclude that the Szekeres models can provide an exact
framework for the analysis of large-scale growth data that includes
inhomogeneities and allows for different interpretations of observations.

cattle undoubtedly altered the patterning of variation within their genomes.
Strong selection to fix advantageous large-effect mutations underlying
domesticability, breed characteristics or productivity created selective sweeps
in which variation was lost in the chromosomal region flanking the selected
allele. Selective sweeps have been identified in the genomes of many species
including humans, dogs, horses, and chickens. We attempt to identify regions of
the bovine genome that have been subjected to selective sweeps. Two datasets
were used for the discovery and validation of selective sweeps via the fixation
of alleles at a series of contiguous SNP loci. BovineSNP50 data were used to
identify 28 putative sweep regions among 14 cattle breeds. Affymetrix BOS 1
prescreening assay data for five breeds were used to identify 114 regions and
validate 5 regions identified using the BovineSNP50 data. Many genes are
located within these regions; however, phenotypes that we predict to have
historically been under strong selection include horned-polled, coat color,
stature, ear morphology, and behavior. The identified selective sweeps
represent recent events associated with breed formation rather than ancient
events associated with domestication. No sweep regions were shared between
indicine and taurine breeds reflecting their divergent selection histories. A
primary finding of this study is the sensitivity of results to assay
resolution. Despite the bias towards common SNPs in the BovineSNP50 design,
false positive sweep regions appear to be common due to the limited resolution
of the assay. This assay design bias leads to the detection of breed-specific
sweep regions, or regions shared by a small number of breeds, restricting the
suite of selected phenotypes detected to primarily those associated with breed
characteristics.

  Spaces",,,,,"cs.CG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  We present improved upper bounds for the size of relative
(p,Epsilon)-approximation for range spaces with the following property: For any
(finite) range space projected onto (that is, restricted to) a ground set of
size n and for any parameter 1 <= k <= n, the number of ranges of size at most
k is only nearly-linear in n and polynomial in k. Such range spaces are called
""well behaved"". Our bound is an improvement over the bound O(\log{(1/p)/\eps^2
p) introduced by Li etal. for the general case (where this bound has been shown
to be tight in the worst case), when p << Epsilon. We also show that such small
size relative (p,Epsilon)-approximations can be constructed in expected
polynomial time.
  Our bound also has an interesting interpretation in the context of ""p-nets"":
As observed by Har-Peled and Sharir, p-nets are special cases of relative
(p,Epsilon)-approximations. Specifically, when Epsilon is a constant smaller
than 1, their analysis implies that there are p-nets of size O(\log{(1/p)}/p)
that are \emph{also} relative approximations. In this context our construction
significantly improves this bound for well-behaved range spaces. Despite the
progress in the theory of p-nets and the existence of improved bounds
corresponding to the cases that we study, these bounds do not necessarily
guarantee a bounded relative error.
  Lastly, we present several geometric scenarios of well-behaved range spaces,
and show the resulting bound for each of these cases obtained as a consequence
of our analysis. In particular, when Epsilon is a constant smaller than 1, our
bound for points and axis-parallel boxes in two and three dimensions, as well
as points and ""fat"" triangles in the plane, matches the optimal bound for
p-nets.

statistical query processing over sensitive data. It works by injecting random
noise into each query result, such that it is provably hard for the adversary
to infer the presence or absence of any individual record from the published
noisy results. The main objective in differentially private query processing is
to maximize the accuracy of the query results, while satisfying the privacy
guarantees. Previous work, notably \cite{LHR+10}, has suggested that with an
appropriate strategy, processing a batch of correlated queries as a whole
achieves considerably higher accuracy than answering them individually.
However, to our knowledge there is currently no practical solution to find such
a strategy for an arbitrary query batch; existing methods either return
strategies of poor quality (often worse than naive methods) or require
prohibitively expensive computations for even moderately large domains.
  Motivated by this, we propose the \emph{Low-Rank Mechanism} (LRM), the first
practical differentially private technique for answering batch queries with
high accuracy, based on a \emph{low rank approximation} of the workload matrix.
We prove that the accuracy provided by LRM is close to the theoretical lower
bound for any mechanism to answer a batch of queries under differential
privacy. Extensive experiments using real data demonstrate that LRM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art query processing solutions under
differential privacy, by large margins.

this problem can be decomposed into two parts: first, infer smaller subnetwork
components (i.e., $1$-by-$N$'s or $2$-by-$2$'s) and then merge these components
to identify the $M$-by-$N$ topology. In this paper, we focus on the second
part, which had previously received less attention in the literature. In
particular, we assume that a $1$-by-$N$ topology is given and that all
$2$-by-$2$ components can be queried and learned using end-to-end probes. The
problem is which $2$-by-$2$'s to query and how to merge them with the given
$1$-by-$N$, so as to exactly identify the $2$-by-$N$ topology, and optimize a
number of performance metrics, including the number of queries (which directly
translates into measurement bandwidth), time complexity, and memory usage. We
provide a lower bound, $\lceil \frac{N}{2} \rceil$, on the number of
$2$-by-$2$'s required by any active learning algorithm and propose two greedy
algorithms. The first algorithm follows the framework of multiple hypothesis
testing, in particular Generalized Binary Search (GBS), since our problem is
one of active learning, from $2$-by-$2$ queries. The second algorithm is called
the Receiver Elimination Algorithm (REA) and follows a bottom-up approach: at
every step, it selects two receivers, queries the corresponding $2$-by-$2$, and
merges it with the given $1$-by-$N$; it requires exactly $N-1$ steps, which is
much less than all $\binom{N}{2}$ possible $2$-by-$2$'s. Simulation results
over synthetic and realistic topologies demonstrate that both algorithms
correctly identify the $2$-by-$N$ topology and are near-optimal, but REA is
more efficient in practice.

various (purely) structural decomposition methods that have been proposed in
the literature to single out classes of nearly-acyclic (hyper)graphs, such as
the tree decomposition method, which is the most powerful decomposition method
on graphs, and the (generalized) hypertree decomposition method, which is its
natural counterpart on arbitrary hypergraphs. The paper analyzes this
framework, by focusing in particular on ""minimal"" tree projections, that is, on
tree projections without useless redundancies. First, it is shown that minimal
tree projections enjoy a number of properties that are usually required for
normal form decompositions in various structural decomposition methods. In
particular, they enjoy the same kind of connection properties as (minimal) tree
decompositions of graphs, with the result being tight in the light of the
negative answer that is provided to the open question about whether they enjoy
a slightly stronger notion of connection property, defined to speed-up the
computation of hypertree decompositions. Second, it is shown that tree
projections admit a natural game-theoretic characterization in terms of the
Captain and Robber game. In this game, as for the Robber and Cops game
characterizing tree decompositions, the existence of winning strategies implies
the existence of monotone ones. As a special case, the Captain and Robber game
can be used to characterize the generalized hypertree decomposition method,
where such a game-theoretic characterization was missing and asked for. Besides
their theoretical interest, these results have immediate algorithmic
applications both for the general setting and for structural decomposition
methods that can be recast in terms of tree projections.

secular processes. A little explored question is how this evolution would be
modified if the initial disc was assembled around a preexisting classical
bulge. Previously we showed that a low-mass initial classical bulge (ICB), as
might have been present in Milky Way-like galaxies, can spin up significantly
by gaining angular momentum from a bar formed through disc instability. Here we
investigate how the disc instability and the kinematics of the final
boxy/peanut (BP) bulge depend on the angular momentum of such a low-mass ICB.
We show that a strong bar forms and transfers angular momentum to the ICB in
all our models. However, rotation in the ICB limits the emission of the bar's
angular momentum, which in turn changes the size and growth of the bar, and of
the BP bulge formed from the disc.
  The final BP bulge in these models is a superposition of the BP bulge formed
via the buckling instability and the spun-up ICB. We find that the long-term
kinematics of the composite BP bulges in our simulations is independent of the
rotation of the ICB, and is always described by cylindrical rotation. However,
as a result of the co-evolution between bulge and bar, deviations from
cylindrical rotation are seen during the early phases of secular evolution, and
may correspond to similar deviations observed in some bulges. We provide a
simple criterion to quantify deviations from pure cylindrical rotation, apply
it to all our model bulges, and also illustrate its use for two galaxies:
NGC7332 and NGC4570.

numerically that the inclusion of the easy-axis anisotropy into the model leads
to the appearance of the 1/3 magnetization plateau, corresponding to the
collinear up-up-down spin structure. This explains the appearance of the 1/3
magnetization plateau in rare earth tetraborides RB$_4$. In particular,

therefore, its vibrations are of primary importance for the sound
characteristics of the instrument. An original vibro-acoustical method is
presented to isolate the soundboard nonlinearity from that of the exciting
device (here: a loudspeaker) and to measure it. The nonlinear part of the
soundboard response to an external excitation is quantitatively estimated for
the first time, at \approx -40 dB below the linear part at the ff nuance. Given
this essentially linear response, a modal identification is performed up to 3
kHz by means of a novel high resolution modal analysis technique (Ege et al.,
High-resolution modal analysis, JSV, 325(4-5), 2009). Modal dampings (which, so
far, were unknown for the piano in this frequency range) are determined in the
midfrequency domain where FFT-based methods fail to evaluate them with an
acceptable precision. They turn out to be close to those imposed by wood. A
finite-element modelling of the soundboard is also presented. The low-order
modal shapes and the comparison between the corresponding experimental and
numerical modal frequencies suggest that the boundary conditions can be
considered as blocked, except at very low frequencies. The frequency-dependency
of the modal density and the observation of modal shapes reveal two
well-separated regimes. Below \approx 1 kHz, the soundboard vibrates more or
less like a homogeneous plate. Above that limit, the structural waves are
confined by ribs, as already noticed by several authors, and localised in
restricted areas (one or a few inter-rib spaces), presumably due to a slightly
irregular spacing of the ribs across the soundboard.

where one entity influences another. The boundary of an interaction is given by
a pair of events, which can be ordered by virtue of the interaction. This
results in a partially ordered set (poset) of events often referred to as a
causal set. In this framework, an observer can be represented by a chain of
events. Quantification of events and pairs of events, referred to as intervals,
can be performed by projecting them onto an observer chain, or even a pair of
observer chains, which in specific situations leads to a Minkowski metric
replete with Lorentz transformations. We illustrate how this framework of
interaction events gives rise to some of the well-known properties of the
Fermions, such as Zitterbewegung. We then take this further by making
inferences about events, which is performed by employing the process calculus,
which coincides with the Feynman path integral formulation of quantum
mechanics. We show that in the 1+1 dimensional case this results in the Feynman
checkerboard model of the Dirac equation describing a Fermion at rest.

moves closer the two distributions while implying a low-error for both tasks.

Coulomb repulsion causes rapid expansion of the band at carrier concentrations
departing from unity. This expansion shifts the d-wave superconductivity away
from the half filled point reducing its occupation range approximately to the
experimental range in the YBaCuO compound. The CP approximation used for the
Coulomb repulsion is justified by the large ratio of Coulomb repulsion to the
effective width of perturbed density of states being reduced by the hopping

existence of a point in S(k) that does not lie on six exceptional curves of S
and that has order 3 on its fiber of the elliptic fibration. This allows us to
show that within a parameter space for del Pezzo surfaces of degree 1 over the
field of real numbers, the set of surfaces S defined over the field Q of
rational numbers for which the set S(Q) is Zariski dense, is dense with respect
to the real analytic topology. We also include conditions that may be satisfied
for every del Pezzo surface S and that can be verified with a finite
computation for any del Pezzo surface S that does satisfy them.

ring. Using deuteron beams with energies 1.2, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.27 GeV, data were
obtained for small momentum transfers to a (pp) system with low excitation
energy. The results at the three lower energies are consistent with impulse
approximation predictions based upon the current knowledge of the
neutron-proton amplitudes. However, at 2.27GeV, where these amplitudes are far
more uncertain, agreement requires a reduction in the overall double-spin-flip
contribution, with an especially significant effect in the longitudinal

deuteron-proton spin-correlation parameters C_{x,x} and C_{y,y} that were
carried out in the pol{d}pol{p} -> (pp)n reaction at 1.2 and 2.27GeV. The
values obtained for the proton analysing power also suggest the need for a
radical re-evaluation of the neutron-proton elastic scattering amplitudes at
the higher energy. It is therefore clear that such measurements can provide a
valuable addition to the neutron-proton database in the charge-exchange region.

predictions of the \gamma-ray observable radioisotope 18F produced in novae.
The determination of this rate is challenging due to particular features of the
level scheme of the compound nucleus, 19Ne, which result in interference
effects potentially playing a significant role. The dominant uncertainty in
this rate arises from interference between J\pi=3/2+ states near the proton
threshold (Sp = 6.411 MeV) and a broad J\pi=3/2+ state at 665 keV above
threshold. This unknown interference term results in up to a factor of 40
uncertainty in the astrophysical S-factor at nova temperatures. Here we report
a new measurement of states in this energy region using the 19F(3He,t)19Ne
reaction. In stark contrast with previous assumptions we find at least 3
resonances between the proton threshold and Ecm=50 keV, all with different
angular distributions. None of these are consistent with J\pi= 3/2+ angular
distributions. We find that the main uncertainty now arises from the unknown
proton-width of the 48 keV resonance, not from possible interference effects.
Hydrodynamic nova model calculations performed indicate that this unknown width
affects 18F production by at least a factor of two in the model considered.

probes is a crucial component of Fermi's Paradox. Previous attempts to estimate
this travel time have assumed that the probe's motion is simple, moving at a
constant maximum velocity, with powered flight producing the necessary change
in velocity required at each star to complete its chosen trajectory. This
approach ignores lessons learned from interplanetary exploration, where orbital
slingshot maneouvres can provide significant velocity boosts at little to no
fuel cost. It is plausible that any attempt to explore the Galaxy would utilise
such economising techniques, despite there being an upper limit to these
velocity boosts, related to the escape velocity of the object being used to
provide the slingshot.
  In order to investigate the effects of these techniques, we present multiple
realisations of single probes exploring a small patch of the Milky Way. We
investigate 3 separate scenarios, studying the slingshot effect on trajectories
defined by simple heuristics. These scenarios are: i) standard powered flight
to the nearest unvisited star without using slingshot techniques; ii) flight to
the nearest unvisited star using slingshot techniques, and iii) flight to the
next unvisited star which provides the maximal velocity boost under a slingshot
trajectory.
  We find that adding slingshot velocity boosts can decrease the travel time by
up to two orders of magnitude over simple powered flight. In the third case,
selecting a route which maximises velocity boosts also reduces the travel time
relative to powered flight, but by a much reduced factor. From these
simulations, we suggest that adding realistic probe trajectories tends to
strengthen Fermi's Paradox.

darkening coefficients and when we adjust them. We also investigate the effects
of spots in one-colour photometry. We study the effect of limb darkening on the
planetary radius determination both via analytical expressions and by numerical
experiments. We also compare some of the existing limb darkening tables. When
stellar spots affect the fit, we replace the limb darkening coefficients,
calculated for the unspotted cases, with effective limb darkening coefficients
to describe the effect of the spots. There are two important cases. (1) When
one fixes the limb darkening values according to some theoretical predictions,
the inconsistencies of the tables do not allow us to reach accuracy in the
planetary radius of better than 1-10% (depending on the impact parameter) if
the host star's surface effective temperature is higher than 5000 K. Below 5000
K the radius ratio determination may contain even 20% error. (2) When one
allows adjustment of the limb darkening coefficients, the a/Rs ratio, the
planet-to-stellar radius ratio, and the impact parameter can be determined with
sufficient accuracy (<1%), if the signal-to-noise ratio is high enough.
However, the presence of stellar spots and faculae can destroy the agreement
between the limb darkening tables and the fitted limb darkening coefficients,
but this does not affect the precision of the planet radius determination. We
also find that it is necessary to fit the contamination factor, too. We
conclude that the present inconsistencies of theoretical stellar limb darkening
tables suggests one should not fix the limb darkening coefficients. When one
allows them to be adjusted, then the planet radius, impact parameter, and the
a/Rs can be obtained with the required precision.

system and a multi-wavelength campaign was organized to study its 2011
periastron passage. We report here on the results of the radio observations
obtained in this monitoring campaign. We used the Expanded Very Large Array
(EVLA) radio interferometer to obtain 6 and 20 cm continuum fluxes. The
observed radio light curve shows a steep drop in flux sometime before
periastron. The fluxes drop to a level that is comparable to the expected
free-free emission from the stellar winds, suggesting that the non-thermal
emitting region is completely hidden at that time. After periastron passage,
the fluxes slowly increase. We introduce a simple model to solve the radiative
transfer in the stellar winds and the colliding-wind region, and thus determine
the expected behaviour of the radio light curve. From the asymmetry of the
light curve, we show that the primary has the stronger wind. This is somewhat
unexpected if we use the astrophysical parameters based on theoretical
calibrations. But it becomes entirely feasible if we take into account that a
given spectral type - luminosity class combination covers a range of
astrophysical parameters. The colliding-wind region also contributes to the
free-free emission, which can help to explain the high values of the spectral
index seen after periastron passage. Combining our data with older Very Large
Array (VLA) data allows us to derive a period P = 860.0 +- 3.7 days for this

frequencies with theoretical ones, but has proven to be difficult in rapidly
rotating stars.
  Aims: To further constrain mode identification, we aim to accurately
calculate mode visibilities and amplitude ratios in rapid rotators.
  Methods: We derive the relevant equations for calculating mode visibilities
in different photometric bands while fully taking into account the geometric
distortion from both the centrifugal deformation and the pulsation modes, the
variations in effective gravity, and an approximate treatment of the
temperature variations. These equations are then applied to 2D oscillation
modes, calculated using the TOP code, in fully distorted 2D models based on the
SCF method. The specific intensities come from a grid of Kurucz atmospheres,
thereby taking into account limb and gravity darkening.
  Results: We obtain mode visibilities and amplitude ratios for 2 M_{\odot}
models rotating at 0 to 80 % of the critical rotation rate. These calculations
confirm previous results, such as the increased visibility of chaotic modes,
the simpler frequency spectra of pole-on stars, or the dependence of amplitude
ratios on inclination and azimuthal order. In addition, the geometric shape of
the star reduces the contrast between pole-on and equator-on visibilities of
island modes. We also show that modes with similar (ell, |m|) values frequently
have similar amplitude ratios, even in the most rapidly rotating models.

centre of the nearby (3.8 Mpc) dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 5253. This galaxy is
famous for hosting a radio supernebula containing two deeply embedded massive
super star clusters, surrounded by a region of enhanced nitrogen abundance that
has been linked to the presence of WR stars. We detected 11 distinct sources of
red WR bump (CIV) emission over a 20"" (~350 pc) area, each consistent with the
presence of ~1 WCE-type star. WC stars are not found coincident with the
supernebula, although WN stars have previously been detected here. We performed
a multi-component decomposition of the H\alpha\ line across all four fields and
mapped the kinematics of the narrow and broad (FWHM = 100-250 km/s) components.
These maps paint a picture of localised gas flows, as part of multiple
overlapping bubbles and filaments driven by the star clusters throughout the
starburst. We confirm the presence of a strong H\alpha\ velocity gradient over
~4.5"" (~80 pc) coincident with the region of N/O enhancement, and high gas
density known from previous study, and interpret this as an accelerating
ionized gas outflow from the supernebula clusters. We measure the ionized gas
abundances in a number of regions in the outer IFU positions and combine these
with measurements from the literature to assess the radial abundance
distribution. We find that the O/H and N/H profiles are consistent with being
flat. Only the central 50 pc exhibits the well-known N/O enhancement, and we
propose that the unusually high densities/pressures in the supernebula region
have acted to impede the escape of metal-enriched hot winds from the star
clusters and allow them to mix with the cooler phases, thus allowing these
freshly processed chemicals to be seen in the optical.

Rules of syntax are often ordered in that before one rule can applied one must
apply another. It has been thought that to learn the order of n rules one must
go through all n! permutations. Thus to learn the order of 27 rules would
require 27! steps or 1.08889x10^{28} steps. This number is much greater than
the number of seconds since the beginning of the universe! In an insightful

111209A is a clear outlier in the energy-fluence and duration plane. The

0-1 spins evolving under a simple Glauber dynamics in the presence of a kinetic
constraint which forbids flips of those spins whose left neighbor is 1. We
focus on the glassy effects caused by the kinetic constraint as $q\downarrow
0$, where $q$ is the equilibrium density of the 0's. In the physical literature
this limit is equivalent to the zero temperature limit. We first prove that,
for any given $L=O(1/q)$, the divergence as $q\downarrow 0$ of three basic
characteristic time scales of the East process of length $L$ is the same. Then
we examine the problem of dynamic heterogeneity, i.e. non-trivial
spatio-temporal fluctuations of the local relaxation to equilibrium, one of the
central aspects of glassy dynamics. For any mesoscopic length scale
$L=O(q^{-\gamma})$, $\gamma<1$, we show that the characteristic time scale of
two East processes of length $L$ and $\lambda L$ respectively are indeed
separated by a factor $q^{-a}$, $a=a(\gamma)>0$, provided that $\lambda \geq 2$
is large enough (independent of $q$, $\lambda=2$ for $\gamma<1/2$). In
particular, the evolution of mesoscopic domains, i.e. maximal blocks of the
form $111..10$, occurs on a time scale which depends sharply on the size of the
domain, a clear signature of dynamic heterogeneity. A key result for this part
is a very precise computation of the relaxation time of the chain as a function
of $(q,L)$, well beyond the current knowledge, which uses induction on length
scales on one hand and a novel algorithmic lower bound on the other. Finally we
show that no form of time scale separation occurs for $\gamma=1$, i.e. at the

covering ~1150 - 1470 A with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on board the
Hubble Space Telescope. This spectrum is highly peculiar, highlighted by the
presence of faint (~< 2% of predictions based on H-alpha), broad (>~ 10,000
km/s at the base), and highly blueshifted (centroid at ~ -3500 km/s) Ly-alpha
emission. The FUV continuum emission is slightly declining at shorter
wavelengths (consistent with F_lambda ~ lambda^1.7) and does not show the
presence of any obvious photospheric or wind stellar features. Surprisingly,
the FUV spectrum also does not show any unambiguous broad absorption features.
It thus appears to be dominated by the AGN, rather than hot stars, and
virtually unfiltered by the dusty FeLoBAL screen. The observed Ly-alpha
emission is best explained if it is produced in the outflowing BAL cloud
system, while the Balmer lines arise primarily from the standard broad emission

of a solar mass, whose composition is the result of incomplete silicon burning
that reaches peak temperatures of 4 GK to 5 GK. The elemental abundances are
sensitive to the physical conditions in the explosion, making their measurement
a promising clue to uncovering the properties of the progenitor star and of the
explosion itself. Using a parameterized description of the thermodynamic
history of matter undergoing incomplete silicon burning, we computed the final
composition for a range of parameters wide enough to encompass current models
of SNIa. Then, we searched for combinations of elemental abundances that trace
the parameters values and are potentially measurable. For this purpose, we
divide the present study into two epochs of SNIa, namely the optical epoch,
from a few weeks to several months after the explosion, and the X-ray epoch,
which refers to the time period in which the supernova remnant is young,
starting one or two hundred years age and ending a thousand years after the
event. During the optical epoch, the only SNIa property that can be extracted
from the detection of incomplete silicon burning elements is the neutron excess
of the progenitor white dwarf at thermal runaway, which can be determined
through measuring the ratio of the abundance of manganese to that of titanium,
chromium, or vanadium. Conversely, in the X-ray epoch, any abundance ratio
built using a couple of elements from titanium, vanadium, chromium, or
manganese may constrain the initial neutron excess. Furthermore, measuring the
ratio of the abundances of vanadium to manganese in the X-ray might shed light
on the timescale of the thermonuclear explosion.

transferring nominal network features to numeric ones by exploiting the

and show a bi-modal structure. This is also present in the inferred rotational
velocity distribution with 25% of the sample having $0\leq$\ve$\leq$100\,\kms
and the high velocity component having \ve$\sim 250$\,\kms. There is no
evidence from the spatial and radial velocity distributions of the two
components that they represent either field and cluster populations or
different episodes of star formation. Be-type stars have also been identified.
  Conclusions: The bi-modal rotational velocity distribution in our sample
resembles that found for late-B and early-A type stars. While magnetic braking
appears to be a possible mechanism for producing the low-velocity component, we
can not rule out alternative explanations.

derived from communications theory which defines multiplex as combining
multiple signals into one in such way that it is possible to separate them if

variety of applications was in recent years complemented by interesting
nanotechnological applications. The fabrication of complex cellulose-based
materials asks for thorough understanding of the surface structure and its
interactions with adsorbates. In this study we investigate several surface
model systems of nanotechnological interest, which are obtained by
reorganization of the cellulose-vacuum or cellulose-water interfaces of slabs
of crystalline cellulose. To do this, we constructed supercells from
crystallographic data, and then optimized the interface structures. From the
bulk and surface systems we calculated structural properties such as unit cell
parameters, dihedral conformation distributions, density profiles and hydrogen
bonding. The results suggest that no overall geometrical restructuring occurs
at the interface. However, the hydrogen bond network is strongly reconstructed,
as is inferred from the dihedral conformations and hydrogen bond occurrences,
although only within the first few layers. This holds for low index close
packed structures as well as for high index loosely packed surfaces. Replacing
the vacuum by ambient pressure water molecules we find less rearrangements of
the cellulose surface, because the water allows formation of hydrogen bonds
similar to those in the bulk phase. The water near the cellulose surface shows,
however, strong structural changes. We observe reduced mobility of the water
molecules, which corresponds to a cooling of water by about 30 degrees, in a
slab that is about 10 \AA\ thick. Although structuring and adsorption is
observed on all surfaces, no actual penetration of water into the cellulose
structure could be observed. This suggests that pure water is not sufficient to
produce cellulose swelling at mesoscopic timescales.

non-self mainly stems from the ontogenic clonal-deletion of lymphocytes
expressing strong binding affinity with self-peptides. However, some
self-directed lymphocytes may evade selection and still be harmless due to a
mechanism called clonal anergy. As for B lymphocytes, two major explanations
for anergy developed over three decades: according to ""Varela theory"", it stems
from a proper orchestration of the whole B-repertoire, in such a way that
self-reactive clones, due to intensive interactions and feed-back from other
clones, display more inertia to mount a response. On the other hand, according
to the `two-signal model"", which has prevailed nowadays, self-reacting cells
are not stimulated by helper lymphocytes and the absence of such signaling
yields anergy. The first result we present, achieved through disordered
statistical mechanics, shows that helper cells do not prompt the activation and
proliferation of a certain sub-group of B cells, which turn out to be just
those broadly interacting, hence it merges the two approaches as a whole (in
particular, Varela theory is then contained into the two-signal model). As a
second result, we outline a minimal topological architecture for the B-world,
where highly connected clones are self-directed as a natural consequence of an
ontogenetic learning; this provides a mathematical framework to Varela
perspective. As a consequence of these two achievements, clonal deletion and
clonal anergy can be seen as two inter-playing aspects of the same phenomenon
too.

and Models for Robotic Systems (DSLRob'11), held in conjunction with the 2011
IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS
2011), September 2011 in San Francisco, USA.
  The main topics of the workshop were Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and
Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) for robotics. A domain-specific
language (DSL) is a programming language dedicated to a particular problem
domain that offers specific notations and abstractions that increase programmer
productivity within that domain. Models offer a high-level way for domain users
to specify the functionality of their system at the right level of abstraction.
DSLs and models have historically been used for programming complex systems.
However recently they have garnered interest as a separate field of study.
Robotic systems blend hardware and software in a holistic way that
intrinsically raises many crosscutting concerns (concurrency, uncertainty, time
constraints, ...), for which reason, traditional general-purpose languages
often lead to a poor fit between the language features and the implementation
requirements. DSLs and models offer a powerful, systematic way to overcome this
problem, enabling the programmer to quickly and precisely implement novel
software solutions to complex problems

of the visibility function often leave an unsampled hole near the origin of the
(u,v)-plane. In this paper, originally published in 1979, we first describe the
common solution of retrieving the information from scans made with a large
single-dish telescope. However, this is not the only means by which short
spacing visibility data can be obtained. We propose an alternative technique
that employs a short-baseline interferometer to scan the entire primary beam
area. The obvious advantage is that a short-baseline pair from the synthesis
instrument can be used, ensuring uniformity in instrumental characteristics.
This technique is the basis for the mosaicing algorithms now commonly used in
aperture synthesis radio astronomy imaging.
