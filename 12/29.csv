revealed a huge, very peculiar structure of diffuse X-ray emission, originating
at the pulsar position and extending for > 9' on the plane of the sky. To
better understand the nature of such a nebula, we have studied the proper
motion of the parent pulsar. We performed relative astrometry on Chandra images
of the field spanning a time baseline of 2.2 yr, unveiling a significant
angular displacement of the pulsar counterpart, corresponding to a proper
motion of 0.165""+/-0.030"" yr^(-1). At a distance of ~500 pc, the space velocity
of the pulsar would be of ~390 km s^(-1) assuming no inclination with respect
to the plane of the sky. The direction of the pulsar proper motion is perfectly
aligned with the main axis of the X-ray nebula, pointing to a physical, yet
elusive link between the nebula and the pulsar space velocity. No optical
emission in the H_alpha line is seen in a deep image collected at the Gemini
telescope, which implies that the interstellar medium into which the pulsar is
moving is fully ionized.

  Systems (Full Version)","Added some corrections from the Journal version",,,,"cs.SY cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce quantatitive timed refinement and timed simulation (directed)
metrics, incorporating zenoness check s, for timed systems. These metrics
assign positive real numbers between zero and infinity which quantify the
\emph{timing mismatches} between two timed systems, amongst non-zeno runs. We
quantify timing mismatches in three ways: (1) the maximal timing mismatch that
can arise, (2) the ""steady-state"" maximal timing mismatches, where initial
transient timing mismatches are ignored; and (3) the (long-run) average timing
mismatches amongst two systems. These three kinds of mismatches constitute
three important types of timing differences. Our event times are the
\emph{global times}, measured from the start of the system execution, not just
the time durations of individual steps. We present algorithms over timed
automata for computing the three quantitative simulation distances to within
any desired degree of accuracy. In order to compute the values of the
quantitative simulation distances, we use a game theoretic formulation. We
introduce two new kinds of objectives for two player games on finite-state game
graphs: (1) eventual debit-sum level objectives, and (2) average debit-sum
level objectives. We present algorithms for computing the optimal values for
these objectives in graph games, and then use these algorithms to compute the
values of the timed simulation distances over timed automata.

functions and degrees of freedom are obtained from the reference element by
pullback of differential forms. In the case where the diffeomorphisms from the

standard that the rate of convergence in L2 exceeds by one the degree of the

  The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and engineers
interested in the application of (semi-)formal methods to improve the quality
of safety-critical computer systems. FTSCS is particularly interested in
industrial applications of formal methods. Topics include:
  - the use of formal methods for safety-critical and QoS-critical systems,
including avionics, automotive, and medical systems; - methods, techniques and
tools to support automated analysis, certification, debugging, etc.; - analysis
methods that address the limitations of formal methods in industry; - formal
analysis support for modeling languages used in industry, such as AADL,
Ptolemy, SysML, SCADE, Modelica, etc.; and - code generation from validated
models.
  The workshop received 25 submissions; 21 of these were regular papers and 4
were tool/work-in-progress/position papers. Each submission was reviewed by
three referees; based on the reviews and extensive discussions, the program
committee selected nine regular papers, which are included in this volume. Our
program also included an invited talk by Ralf Huuck.

refines SE. Models are expansions of $\mathit{SCI}$-models. We show that
$\mathit{SCI}$-models are Boolean prealgebras, and vice-versa. This associates
Non-Fregean Logic with research on Hyperintensional Semantics. PI equals SE iff

between turbulent shear flows and statistical mechanics, through a detailed
numerical investigation in the simplest case where both can be well defined.
The shear flow considered for the purpose is the 2D temporal mixing layer,
which is a time-dependent flow that is statistically homogeneous in the
streamwise direction (x) and evolves from a plane vortex sheet in the direction
normal to it (y) in a periodic-in-x domain with period L. The connections to
statistical mechanics are explored by revisiting, via extensive computer
simulations, an appropriate initial value problem for a finite but large
collection of (N) point vortices of same strength (\gamma) and sign
constituting a 'vortex gas'. Such connections may be expected to be meaningful
as hydrodynamics, since the flow associated with the vortex gas is known to
provide weak solutions of the Euler equation. Over ten different initial
conditions classes are investigated using simulations involving up to 10^4
vortices, with ensemble averages evaluated over up to 10^3 realizations and
integration over 10^4 L/(\Delta U) (where \Delta U is the velocity differential
across the layer, given by N\gamma/L). (see PDF for complete abstract)

signal, and the decisions of all earlier-acting agents---with the actions of
precedent agents causing updates of the initial belief. Each agent acts to
minimize Bayes risk, with all agents sharing the same Bayes costs for Type I

initial beliefs on the decision-making performance of the last agent is
studied. The last agent makes the best decision when the initial beliefs are
inaccurate. When the private signals are described by Gaussian likelihoods, the
optimal initial beliefs are not haphazard but rather follow a systematic
pattern: the earlier-acting agents should act as if the prior probability is
larger than it is in reality when the true prior probability is small, and vice
versa. We interpret this as being open minded toward the unlikely hypothesis.
The early-acting agents face a trade-off between making a correct decision and

between neighbored ions is studied. To study this affection, an ideal square
lattice composed of triangle unit is proposed and studied. Every unit in the
square lattice has three ions and only one ion charge, the ion charge is
distributed on one A ion and two B ions with different possibility, and the A-B
bond length is far less than the distance between nearest units. The position
difference between A-B ions results in a lattice deformation with fixed
amplitude, and can be treated as an electricity dipole lattice. It is proved
that such lattice has a negative energy gap that can be much larger than that
of normal metal superconductor, and suggests a new superconductor mechanism.

frequency, the incidence angle of the light wave and different ratios of the
refractive indices. In contrast to a periodically aligned stack we find
complete transmission for the quasiperiodic systems for a wide range of
different refraction indices for small incidence angles. Additional bands of
moderate transmission occur for frequencies in the range of the photonic band
gaps of the periodic system. Further, for fixed indices of refraction we find a
range of almost perfect transmission for angles close to the angle of total
reflection, which is caused by the bending of photonic transmission bands
towards higher frequencies for increasing incidence angles. Comparing with the
results of a periodic stack the quasiperiodicity seems to have only an
influence in the region around the midgap frequency of a periodic stack.

framework to construct an effective Hamiltonian for these decays. The effective
coupling constant $\frac{G_{X}}{\sqrt{2}}=\frac{g^{2}_{X}}{8m^{2}_{X}}$;
$m_{X}$ is the mass at which the group $G$ is broken to the SM group. The upper
bound on ($G_{X}/G_{F}$)is obtained from the most stringent experimental limit
on the $B.R(K^{0}_{L}\to \mu^{\mp}e^{\pm})$. Several cases of pairing three
generations of leptons and quarks in the representation $(2,\bar{2})$ of the
group are analyzed. For some pairing, the upper bound on $(G_{X}/G_{F})$ is of
the order $(6-9)\times 10^{-6}$ and is compatible with the upper limits on
various LF violating $K$-decays . In particular for these cases, we find the
upper limit on the branching ratio $B.R(K^{0}_{L}\to\mu^{-}\mu^{+})\sim
(1.9-8.3)\times10^{-9}$. It is shown that for LF violating B-decays to lepton

them, H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ have been observed more than two times, in a total
period spanning almost two years between 2008 and 2009. Spectral synthesis of
the H$\alpha$ profile was performed following two steps: photospheric
contribution was computed by using Kurucz's code ATLAS9 and SYNTHE, and disk
emission was derived by the approach of Hummel & Vrancken (2000, A&A, 302,
751). For 26 out of 48 stars, a modeling of the total H$\alpha$ emission has
been attempted. By this modeling we derived an estimation of the disk radius,
as well as the inclination angle between the rotational axis with line of sight
and the base density at the stellar equator. For the stars observed more than
once, we also discuss the variability of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ for what
concerns both the equivalent width and the spectral profile. We found 16 stars
with variable equivalent width and 7 stars with clear signs of profile
variation. We derive effective temperature, gravity, and projected rotational
velocity. We found 13 stars whose equivalent width is variable with a
confidence level greater than 80% and 7 object for which spectral profiles show
change with time. According to the commonly used classification scheme, we
classified 16 stars as belonging to class 1, 13 to class 2, 11 are shell stars,
6 objects do not show net emission, and 2 stars display transitions from class
1 and 2. For the class 1 stars, we confirm the correlation between $v \sin i$
and peak separation. Concerning the geometry of the disk, we derived the base
density at the stellar equator, the radius, and the inclination angle between
rotational axis and line of sight. The maximum concentration of stars occurs
for disk dimensions ranging in the interval of 6 to 8 stellar radii and for
inclination angles going from 23$^\circ$ to $35^\circ$.

Second, we describe a finite volume method which is formulated geometrically

demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method even for

previously studied by Roth, Balcan, Kalai and Mansour. They presented an FPTAS
for computing an approximated equilibrium, and conjectured that there is a
polynomial algorithm for finding an exact equilibrium. We extend their study in
two directions: (1) We show that finding an exact equilibrium, even for
two-player zero-sum games, is polynomial time equivalent to finding a winning
strategy for a (two-player) mean-payoff game on graphs. The existence of a
polynomial algorithm for the latter is a long standing open question in
computer science. Our hardness result for two-player games suggests that
two-player alternating move games are harder to solve than two-player
simultaneous move games, while the work of Roth et al., suggests that for
$k\geq 3$, $k$-player games are easier to analyze in the alternating move
setting. (2) We show that optimal equilibriums (with respect to the social
welfare metric) can be obtained by pure strategies, and we present an FPTAS for
computing a pure approximated equilibrium that is $\delta$-optimal with respect
to the social welfare metric. This result extends the previous work by
presenting an FPTAS that finds a much more desirable approximated equilibrium.
We also show that if there is a polynomial algorithm for mean-payoff games on
graphs, then there is a polynomial algorithm that computes an optimal exact
equilibrium, and hence, (two-player) mean-payoff games on graphs are
inter-reducible with $k$-player alternating move games, for any $k\geq 2$.

to actual numerical results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time such a comprehensive proof is achieved.

solving the Schrodinger equation for an arbitrarily large system be a
reflection of some nature intrinsic property? And if so, could this difficulty
be a resolution to the measurement problem?

over algebras with involution. However, not much is known in the case of forms
without any symmetry property. The present paper will establish Witt
cancellation and base change results, as well as some local-global and
finiteness results in this context.

using econometrics techniques. This work, pretend to analyze the consumers
behavior of the wine produced in Portugal, determining the demand equation with
panel data methods. There were used statistical data available in the Alentejo
Regional Winegrowing Commission (CVRA) website. These data were obtained from a
study about the market analysis, made, in 2009, by the A.C. Nielsen. The data
are disaggregated by region and type of wine (Doc Verde+Regional Minho, Doc
Regiao do Douro+Regional Terras Durienses, Doc Regiao da Bairrada+Regional
Beiras, Doc Regiao do Dao+Regional Beiras, Doc da Regiao de Lisboa+Regional de
Lisboa, Doc da Regiao do Tejo+Regional do Tejo, Doc da Regiao de
Setubal+Regional Terras do Sado, Doc Alentejo+Regional Alentejano e Doc da
Regiao do Algarve+Regional do Algarve), year (2008 and 2009) and by form of
consumption (take home, direct consumption and discount). This work found some
linear regularity in the consumers behavior of the Portuguese wine.
