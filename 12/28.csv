be informatively described by the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation. Various
approximate analytical formulae for a single stationary vortex are recalled and
their shortcomings demonstrated. Significantly more accurate two-point [2/2]
and [3/3] Pade' approximants for stationary vortex profiles are presented. Two
straight, singly quantized, antiparallel vortices, located at a distance d
apart, form a vortex dipole, which, in the GP model, can either annihilate or
propagate indefinitely as a `solitary wave'. We show, through calculations
performed in a periodic domain, that the details and types of behavior
displayed by vortex dipoles depend strongly on the initial conditions rather
than only on the separation distance (as has been previously claimed). It is
found, indeed, that the choice of the initial two-vortex profile (i.e., the
modulus of the `effective wave function'), strongly affects the vortex
trajectories and the time scale of the process: annihilation proceeds more
rapidly when low-energy (or `relaxed') initial profiles are imposed. The
initial `circular' phase distribution contours, customarily obtained by
multiplying an effective wave function for each individual vortex, can be
generalized to explicit elliptical forms specified by two parameters; then by
`tuning' the elliptical shape at fixed d, a sharp transition between
solitary-wave propagation and annihilation is captured. Thereby, a `phase
diagram' for this `AnSol' transition is constructed in the space of ellipticity
and separation and various limiting forms of the boundary are discussed.

elastodynamics. Standard energy methods yield local solutions on a time
interval $[0,{T}/{\epsilon}]$, for initial data of the form $\epsilon U_0$,
where $T$ depends only on some Sobolev norm of $U_0$. We show that for such
data there exists a unique solution on a time interval $[0,
\exp{T}/{\epsilon}]$, provided that $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. This is
achieved by careful consideration of the structure of the nonlinearity. The
incompressible elasticity equation is inherently linearly degenerate in the
isotropic case; in other words, the equation satisfies a null condition. This
is essential for time decay estimates. The pressure, which arises as a Lagrange
multiplier to enforce the incompressibility constraint, is estimated in a novel
way as a nonlocal nonlinear term with null structure. The proof employs the
generalized energy method of Klainerman, enhanced by weighted $L^2$ estimates

Many liquids of practical importance however are more complicated (e.g. blood,

here demonstrate for a model system of such complex fluids that at high shear
rates turbulence is not simply modified as previously believed but it is
suppressed and replaced by a new type of disordered motion, elasto-inertial
turbulence (EIT). EIT is found to occur at much lower Reynolds numbers than
Newtonian turbulence and the dynamical properties differ significantly. In
particular the drag is strongly reduced and the observed friction scaling
resolves a longstanding puzzle in non-Newtonian fluid mechanics regarding the
nature of the so-called maximum drag reduction asymptote. Theoretical
considerations imply that EIT will arise in complex fluids if the extensional

of these varved evaporitic successions reveal significant periodicity peaks at

precipitation data in the western Mediterranean shows that during the acme of
the Messinian salinity crisis the climate was not in a permanent evaporitic
stage, but in a dynamic situation where evaporite deposition was controlled by
quasi-periodic climate oscillations with similarity to modern analogs including
Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation, and decadal to
secular lunar- and solar-induced cycles. Particularly we found a significant
quasi-decadal oscillation with a prominent 9-year peak that is commonly found
also in modern temperature records and is present in the contemporary Atlantic

matter. This material is central to many fundamental questions in nuclear
physics and astrophysics. Moreover, neutron rich matter is being studied with
an extraordinary variety of new tools such as the Facility for Rare Isotope
Beams (FRIB) and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory
(LIGO). We describe the Lead Radius Experiment (PREX) that uses parity
violating electron scattering to measure the neutron radius of 208Pb. This has
important implications for neutron stars and their crusts. We discuss X-ray
observations of neutron star radii. These also have important implications for
neutron rich matter. Gravitational waves (GW) open a new window on neutron rich
matter. They come from sources such as neutron star mergers, rotating neutron
star mountains, and collective r-mode oscillations. Using large scale molecular
dynamics simulations, we find neutron star crust to be very strong. It can
support mountains on rotating neutron stars large enough to generate detectable
gravitational waves. Finally, neutrinos from core collapse supernovae (SN)
provide another, qualitatively different probe of neutron rich matter.
Neutrinos escape from the surface of last scattering known as the
neutrino-sphere. This is a low density warm gas of neutron rich matter.
Neutrino-sphere conditions can be simulated in the laboratory with heavy ion
collisions. Observations of neutrinos can probe nucleosyntheses in SN. We
believe that combing astronomical observations using photons, GW, and
neutrinos, with laboratory experiments on nuclei, heavy ion collisions, and
radioactive beams will fundamentally advance our knowledge of compact objects
in the heavens, the dense phases of QCD, the origin of the elements, and of
neutron rich matter.

equation for the displacement field which are strongly nonlinearly coupled. In
our proposed model, the material may completely disintegrate which is
indispensable for a realistic modeling of damage processes in elastic
materials. Complete damage theories lead to several mathematical problems since
for instance coercivity properties of the free energy are lost and, therefore,
several difficulties arise. For the introduced complete damage model, we
propose a classical formulation and a corresponding suitable weak formulation
in an $SBV$-framework. The main aim is to prove existence of weak solutions for
the introduced degenerating model. In addition, we show that the classical
differential inclusion can be regained from the notion of weak solutions under
certain regularity assumptions which is a novelty in the theory of complete

a cylindrical vessel with elliptical cross-section (both an ellipse and the
annulus between two confocal ellipses). In particular, we address an inverse
problem, namely to compute the velocity field associated with a given,
time-periodic flow rate. This is motivated by the fact that flow rate is the
main physical quantity which can be actually measured in many practical
situations. We propose a novel numerical strategy, which is nonetheless
grounded on several analytical relations. The proposed method leads to the
solution of some simple ordinary differential systems. It holds promise to be
more amenable to implementation than previous approaches, which are
substantially based on the challenging computation of Mathieu functions. Some
numerical results are reported, based on measured data for human blood flow in
the internal carotid artery, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow in the upper
cervical region of the human spine. As expected, computational efficiency is
the main asset of our solution: a speed-up factor over 10^3 was obtained,
compared to more elaborate numerical approaches. The main goal of the present
study is to provide an improved source of initial/boundary data for more
ambitious numerical approaches, as well as a benchmark solution for pulsatile
flows in elliptical sections with given flow rate. The proposed method can be
effectively applied to bio-fluid dynamics investigations (possibly addressing
key aspects of relevant diseases), to biomedical applications (including
targeted drug delivery and energy harvesting for implantable devices), up to
longer-term medical microrobotics applications.

point-like 'blob' particles immersed in an incompressible fluid, generalizing
previous work for compressible fluids. The coupling consistently includes
excess (positive or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the
displaced fluid, and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum
equation. The coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip
constraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the fluid
velocity, and conserves momentum and energy. We demonstrate that the
formulation obeys a fluctuation-dissipation balance, owing to the
non-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. We develop a spatio-temporal
discretization that preserves, as best as possible, these properties of the
continuum formulation. In the spatial discretization, the local averaging and
spreading operations are accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in
immersed boundary methods. We find that the special properties of these kernels
make the discrete blob a particle with surprisingly physically-consistent
volume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties. We develop a second-order
semi-implicit temporal integrator that maintains discrete
fluctuation-dissipation balance, and is not limited in stability by viscosity.
Furthermore, the temporal scheme requires only constant-coefficient Poisson and
Helmholtz linear solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple FFT-based
implementation on GPUs. We numerically investigate the performance of the
method on several standard test problems...

(BSGs). Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) from such progenitors could have ultra-long
duration of relativistic jets. For example Population III (Pop III) GRBs at z ~
10-20 might be observable as X-ray rich events with a typical duration of T_90
~ 10^4(1+z) sec. Recent GRB111209A at z = 0.677 has an ultra long duration of
T_90 ~ 2.5*10^4 sec so that it have been suggested that the progenitor might be
a metal-poor BSGs in the local universe. Here, we suggest luminous
UV/optical/infrared emissions associated with such a new class of GRB from
metal poor BSGs. Before the jet head breaks out the progenitor envelope, the
energy injected by the jet is stored in a hot-plasma cocoon, which finally
emerges and expands as a baryon-loaded fireball. We show that the photospheric
emissions from the cocoon fireball could be intrinsically very bright (L_peak ~
10^(42-44) erg/sec) in UV/optical bands (E_peak ~ 10 eV) with a typical
duration of ~ 100 days in the rest frame. Such cocoon emissions from Pop III
GRB might be detectable in infrared bands at ~ years after Pop III GRBs at up
to z ~ 15 by up-coming facilities like JWST. We also suggest that GRB111209A
might have been rebrightening in UV/optical bands up to an AB magnitude of <
26. The cocoon emissions from local metal-poor BSGs might have been already
observed as luminous supernovae without GRB since they can be seen from the

  note: text overlap with arXiv:1212.6225",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel class of Nash problems for Cognitive Radio
(CR) networks, modeled as Gaussian frequency-selective interference channels,
wherein each secondary user (SU) competes against the others to maximize his
own opportunistic throughput by choosing jointly the sensing duration, the
detection thresholds, and the vector power allocation. The proposed general
formulation allows to accommodate several (transmit) power and
(deterministic/probabilistic) interference constraints, such as constraints on
the maximum individual and/or aggregate (probabilistic) interference tolerable
at the primary receivers. To keep the optimization as decentralized as
possible, global (coupling) interference constraints are imposed by penalizing
each SU with a set of time-varying prices based upon his contribution to the
total interference; the prices are thus additional variable to optimize. The
resulting players' optimization problems are nonconvex; moreover, there are
possibly price clearing conditions associated with the global constraints to be
satisfied by the solution. All this makes the analysis of the proposed games a
challenging task; none of classical results in the game theory literature can
be successfully applied. The main contribution of this paper is to develop a
novel optimization-based theory for studying the proposed nonconvex games; we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the existence and uniqueness of a standard
Nash equilibrium, devise alternative best-response based algorithms, and
establish their convergence.

QSH theory that remains to be experimentally verified is the breakdown of the

establish a rigorous framework for understanding the magnetic field dependence
of electrostatically gated QSH devices. We then report unexpected edge
conduction under broken TRS, using a unique cryogenic microwave impedance
microscopy (MIM), on a 7.5 nm HgTe QW device with an inverted band structure.
At zero magnetic field and low carrier densities, clear edge conduction is
observed in the local conductivity profile of this device but not in the 5.5 nm
control device whose band structure is trivial. Surprisingly, the edge
conduction in the 7.5 nm device persists up to 9 T with little effect from the
magnetic field. This indicates physics beyond simple QSH models, possibly
associated with material- specific properties, other symmetry protection and/or
electron-electron interactions.

The main new ingredient is an operator solution of the Dirac equation expressed

study in detail the residual symmetry of the covariant gauge. For comparison,
we analyze first an analogous solution in the Thirring-Wess model and its
implication for the axial anomaly arising from the necessity to correctly
define products of fermion operators via point-splitting. In the Schwinger
model, one has to define the currents in a gauge invariant (GI) way. Certain
problems with their usual derivation are identified that obscure the origin of
the massive vector boson. We show how to define the truly GI interacting

to a generalized Smoluchowski coagulation equation recently introduced by
Bertoin and Le Gall in the context of continuous-state branching theory. In
particular, this equation governs the evolution of the L\'{e}vy measure of a
critical continuous-state branching process which becomes extinct (i.e., is
absorbed at zero) almost surely. We show that a nondegenerate scaling limit of
the L\'{e}vy measure (and the process) exists if and only if the branching
mechanism is regularly varying at 0. When the branching mechanism is regularly
varying, we characterize nondegenerate scaling limits of arbitrary
finite-measure solutions in terms of generalized Mittag-Leffler series.

finite viscosity in regions where the ionization is too low for the
magnetorotational instability (MRI) to operate (the ""dead zone""). We find that
the presence of a small but finite dead zone viscosity, as suggested by
simulations of stratified disks with MRI-active outer layers, can trigger
inside-out bursts of accretion, starting at or near the inner edge of the disk,
instead of the previously-found outside-in bursts with zero dead zone
viscosity, which originate at a few AU in radius. These inside-out bursts of
accretion bear a qualitative resemblance to the outburst behavior of one FU Ori
object, V1515 Cyg, in contrast to the outside-in burst models which more
closely resemble the accretion events in FU Ori and V1057 Cyg. Our results
suggest that the type and frequency of outbursts are potentially a probe of
transport efficiency in the dead zone. Simulations must treat the inner disk
regions, $R \lesssim 0.5$ AU, to show the detailed time evolution of accretion
outbursts in general and to observe the inside-out bursts in particular.

problem in network science. The traditional and well-known assortativity
coefficient is calculated on a per-network basis, which is of little use to
partial connection tendency of a network. This paper proposes a universal
assortativity coefficient(UAC), which is based on the unambiguous definition of
each individual edge's contribution to the global assortativity coefficient
(GAC). It is able to reveal the connection tendency of microscopic, mesoscopic,
macroscopic structures and any given part of a network. Applying UAC to real
world networks, we find that, contrary to the popular expectation, most
networks (notably the AS-level Internet topology) have markedly more
assortative edges/nodes than dissortaive ones despite their global
dissortativity. Consequently, networks can be categorized along two
dimensions--single global assortativity and local assortativity statistics.
Detailed anatomy of the AS-level Internet topology further illustrates how UAC
can be used to decipher the hidden patterns of connection tendencies on
different scales.

  LDPC Codes",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The error floor phenomenon observed with LDPC codes and their graph-based,
iterative, message-passing (MP) decoders is commonly attributed to the
existence of error-prone substructures -- variously referred to as near
codewords, trapping sets, absorbing sets, or pseudocodewords -- in a Tanner
graph representation of the code. Many approaches have been proposed to lower
the error floor by designing new LDPC codes with fewer such substructures or by
modifying the decoding algorithm. Using a theoretical analysis of iterative MP
decoding in an idealized trapping set scenario, we show that a contributor to
the error floors observed in the literature may be the imprecise implementation
of decoding algorithms and, in particular, the message quantization rules used.
We then propose a new quantization method -- (q+1)-bit quasi-uniform
quantization -- that efficiently increases the dynamic range of messages,
thereby overcoming a limitation of conventional quantization schemes. Finally,
we use the quasi-uniform quantizer to decode several LDPC codes that suffer
from high error floors with traditional fixed-point decoder implementations.
The performance simulation results provide evidence that the proposed
quantization scheme can, for a wide variety of codes, significantly lower error
floors with minimal increase in decoder complexity.

beyond the rotating-wave (RWA) and slowly-varying-envelope approximations. The
method of solution is based on the Maxwell--Bloch equations represented in the
form that allows one to switch between RWA and general (non-RWA) cases in the
framework of a single numerical algorithm. Using this method, the effect of a
subcycle pulse (containing less than a single period of field oscillations) on
the two-level medium was analyzed. It is shown that for such short pulses, the
clear breakdown of the area theorem occurs for the pulses of large enough area.
Moreover, deviations from the area theorem appear to be strongly dependent on
the pulse shape that cannot be observed for longer few-cycle pulses.

assess the effects of aspect ratio and area fraction on their physical
properties. For state points in the plane of aspect ratio (k=1-9) and area
fraction (phi=0.01-0.8), we identify three different phases, including
isotropic, plastic and nematic states. The equation of state (EOS) is shown for
a wide range of aspect ratios and is compared with the scaled particle theory
(SPT) for the isotropic states. We find that SPT provides a good description of
the EOS for the isotropic phase of hard ellipses. At large fixed phi, the
reduced pressure p increases with k in both the isotropic and the plastic
phases, and interestingly, its dependence on k is rather weak in the nematic
phase. We rationalize the thermodynamics of hard ellipses in terms of particle
motions. The plastic crystal is shown to form for aspect ratios up to k=1.4,
while appearance of the stable nematic phase starts approximately at k=3. We
quantitatively determine the locations of the isotropic-plastic (I-P)
transition and the isotropic-nematic (I-N) transition by analyzing the
bond-orientation correlations and the angular correlations, respectively. As
expected, the I-P transition point is found to increase with k, while a larger
k leads to a smaller area fraction where the I-N transition takes place.
Moreover, our simulations strongly support that the two-dimensional nematic
phase in hard ellipses has only quasi-long-range orientational order. The
self-diffusion of hard ellipses is further explored and connections are
revealed between the structure and the self-diffusion. We discuss the relevance
of our results to the glass transition in hard ellipses. Finally, the results
of the isodiffusivity lines are evaluated for hard ellipses and we discuss the
effect of spatial dimension on the diffusive dynamics of hard ellipsoidal
particles.

in the innermost regions close to the central black hole, or by the partial
ionization of hydrogen in the zone of appropriate temperatures. These physical
processes may lead to the intermittent activity in AGN on timescales between
hundreds and millions of years. We list a number of observational facts that
support the idea of the cyclic activity in high accretion rate sources. We
conclude however that the observed features of quasars may provide only
indirect signatures of the underlying instabilities. Also, the support from the
sources with stellar mass black holes, whose variability timescales are
observationally feasible, is limited to a few cases of the microquasars.
Therefore we consider a number of plausible mechanisms of stabilization of the
limit cycle oscillations in high accretion rate accretion disks. The newly
found is the stabilizing effect of the stochastic viscosity fluctuations.

apply our results to piecewise constant potentials, by deriving the appropriate

describes the escape of particles trapped in the inter-barrier region. Finally,

drastic improvement of the measurements that are presently done with the Muon
Spectrometer and, in addition, will give access to new measurements that are
not possible with the present Muon Spectrometer setup. Motivations and
preliminary results are discussed here, concerning the measurement of prompt
and displaced charmonia, open heavy flavors, and low mass dimuons in central
Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 5.5$ TeV.

Representation of rough objects can however depend on the dialectical relation

the context of RST over proto-transitive approximation spaces. This approach
can be directly extended to many other types of RST. These are used for
formulating an extended concept of knowledge interpretation (KI)(relative the

that require large networks. Networks with many inputs (e.g. raw video) imply a
very high dimensional search space if encoded directly. Indirect methods use a
more compact genotype representation that is transformed into networks of
potentially arbitrary size. In this paper, we present an indirect method where
networks are encoded by a set of Fourier coefficients which are transformed
into network weight matrices via an inverse Fourier-type transform. Because
there often exist network solutions whose weight matrices contain regularity
(i.e. adjacent weights are correlated), the number of coefficients required to
represent these networks in the frequency domain is much smaller than the
number of weights (in the same way that natural images can be compressed by
ignore high-frequency components). This ""compressed"" encoding is compared to
the direct approach where search is conducted in the weight space on the
high-dimensional octopus arm task. The results show that representing networks
in the frequency domain can reduce the search-space dimensionality by as much
as two orders of magnitude, both accelerating convergence and yielding more
general solutions.

an arbitrary initial state of the simulated system. A finite series of
transforms is iteratively applied to the initial state assisted with an
ancillary qubit. The fraction of the lowest eigenstate in the initial state is
then amplified up to $\simeq 1$. We prove that our algorithm can faithfully
work for any arbitrary Hamiltonian in the theoretical analysis. Numerical
analyses are also carried out. We firstly provide a numerical
proof-of-principle demonstration with a simple Hamiltonian in order to compare
our scheme with the so-called ""Demon-like algorithmic cooling (DLAC)"", recently
proposed in [Nature Photonics 8, 113 (2014)]. The result shows a good agreement
with our theoretical analysis, exhibiting the comparable behavior to the best
""cooling"" with the DLAC method. We then consider a random Hamiltonian model for
further analysis of our algorithm. By numerical simulations, we show that the
total number $n_c$ of iterations is proportional to $\simeq {\cal
O}(D^{-1}\epsilon^{-0.19})$, where $D$ is the difference between the two lowest
eigenvalues, and $\epsilon$ is an error defined as the probability that the
finally obtained system state is in an unexpected (i.e. not the lowest)
eigenstate.

belongs to pulsed electron deposition methods and its energetic and deposition
parameters are quite similar to those of pulsed laser deposition. The method
has been already proven to provide manganite films with good magnetic
properties, but the films were generally relatively rough (a few nm
coarseness). Here we show that increasing the oxygen deposition pressure with
respect to previously used regimes, reduces the surface roughness down to unit
cell size while maintaining a robust magnetism. We analyse in detail the effect
of other deposition parameters, like accelerating voltage, discharging energy,
and temperature and provide on this basis a set of optimal conditions for the
growth of atomically flat films. The thicknesses for which atomically flat
surface was achieved is as high as about 10-20 nm, corresponding to films with
room temperature magnetism. We believe such magnetic layers represent appealing
and suitable electrodes for various spintronic devices.

channel are presented in the limit as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) tends to
infinity. Asymptotic expressions of the symbol-error probability (SEP) and the
minimum mean-square error (MMSE) achieved by estimating the channel input given
the channel output are also developed. It is shown that for any input
distribution, the conditional entropy of the channel input given the output,
MMSE and SEP have an asymptotic behavior proportional to the Gaussian
Q-function. The argument of the Q-function depends only on the minimum
Euclidean distance (MED) of the constellation and the SNR, and the
proportionality constants are functions of the MED and the probabilities of the
pairs of constellation points at MED. The developed expressions are then
generalized to study the high-SNR behavior of the generalized mutual
information (GMI) for bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM). By means of
these asymptotic expressions, the long-standing conjecture that Gray codes are
the binary labelings that maximize the BICM-GMI at high SNR is proven. It is
further shown that for any equally spaced constellation whose size is a power
of two, there always exists an anti-Gray code giving the lowest BICM-GMI at
high SNR.

  Corpus","University of Bath BSc(Hons) Computer Science Dissertation, 105 Pages",,,"CSBU-2013-01","cs.AI cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A plethora of words are used to describe the spectrum of human emotions, but
how many emotions are there really, and how do they interact? Over the past few
decades, several theories of emotion have been proposed, each based around the
existence of a set of 'basic emotions', and each supported by an extensive
variety of research including studies in facial expression, ethology, neurology
and physiology. Here we present research based on a theory that people transmit
their understanding of emotions through the language they use surrounding
emotion keywords. Using a labelled corpus of over 21,000 tweets, six of the
basic emotion sets proposed in existing literature were analysed using Latent
Semantic Clustering (LSC), evaluating the distinctiveness of the semantic
meaning attached to the emotional label. We hypothesise that the more distinct
the language is used to express a certain emotion, then the more distinct the
perception (including proprioception) of that emotion is, and thus more
'basic'. This allows us to select the dimensions best representing the entire
spectrum of emotion. We find that Ekman's set, arguably the most frequently
used for classifying emotions, is in fact the most semantically distinct
overall. Next, taking all analysed (that is, previously proposed) emotion terms
into account, we determine the optimal semantically irreducible basic emotion
set using an iterative LSC algorithm. Our newly-derived set (Accepting,
Ashamed, Contempt, Interested, Joyful, Pleased, Sleepy, Stressed) generates a
6.1% increase in distinctiveness over Ekman's set (Angry, Disgusted, Joyful,
Sad, Scared). We also demonstrate how using LSC data can help visualise
emotions. We introduce the concept of an Emotion Profile and briefly analyse
compound emotions both visually and mathematically.
