plans to install an upgrade of the ALICE Inner Tracking System (ITS) in the
central barrel with seven layers of silicon detectors starting at 2.2 cm radial
distance from the interaction region and a material budget as low as 0.3%
radiation length per layer. A single-hit resolution of $\mathrm{4 \mu m}$ and a
readout rate capability of up to 50 kHz in Pb--Pb collisions will allow new and
unique measurements in the heavy-quark sector, i.e. charm and beauty. Using
detailed Monte Carlo simulations of pp and Pb--Pb collisions we study the
performance for heavy-flavor detection with an upgraded ITS in the following
benchmark analyses: Charm meson and baryon production, i.e. $\mathrm{D^{0}
\rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{+}}$ and $\mathrm{\Lambda_{c}^{+} \rightarrow
pK^{-}\pi^{+}}$, and beauty meson and baryon production, i.e. displaced

indicated an incomplete normal-to-superconducting transition and offered a work
programme challenging to overcome possible difficulties in their fabrication.
In this regard the possibility of an all in-situ epitaxial growth appeared to
be a matter of time and growth parameters. The following review clarifies that
F-doped oxypnictide thin films are extremely difficult to grow by in-situ PLD
due to the formation of very stable impurity phases such as oxyfluorides (LaOF)
and oxides (La2O3) and the loss of stoichiometry possibly due to incongruent
evaporation of the target or re-evaporation of volatile elements at the
substrate surface. However, the review also demonstrates that the employed
two-step fabrication process for oxypnictide thin films has been successfully
applied in the preparation of clean polycrystalline as well as of epitaxial
thin films. Fundamental investigations on the upper critical field, its
temperature dependence and its anisotropy contributed to an understanding of
multiband superconductivity in oxypnictides.

stellar winds. The collision results in a double shock structure which is
subject to different instabilities. The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI)
introduces some mixing and variability. For isothermal winds, the Non-linear
Thin Shell Instability violently affects the interaction region. Properly
modelling these instabilities requires a high enough resolution and an adapted
numerical method, especially when one of the winds strongly dominates the other
one. At large scale, orbital motion is expected to turn the shocked zone into a
spiral but we find that in some configurations the KHI may disrupt the spiral.
A colliding wind structure is also expected in gamma-ray binaries composed of a
massive star and a young pulsar which emits a highly relativistic wind.
Numerical simulations are necessary to understand the geometry of such systems
and should take into account the relativistic nature of the pulsar wind. We
implemented a second order Godunov method to solve the equations of
relativistic hydrodynamics with RAMSES, including the possibility for Adaptive
Mesh Refinement. After a brief overview of our numerical implementation, we
will present preliminary simulation that contrast the structure of the flow in

strengthening is most pronounced for Ta and Nb, although also causing smallest
elastic distortions of the lattice due to their atomic radii being comparable
with Ti and Al. This is further supported by the analysis of the electronic
density of states. Finally, mixing enthalpy as a measure of the driving force
for decomposition into the stable constituents, is enhanced by adding Y, Zr and

cases for lower thermal loads than for Hf and Ta alloyed Ti$_{1-x}$Al$_x$N.

  Limited Relativity","Submitted to the Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We derive conservative, multidimensional, energy-dependent moment equations
for neutrino transport in core-collapse supernovae and related astrophysical
systems, with particular attention to the consistency of conservative
four-momentum and lepton number transport equations. After taking angular
moments of conservative formulations of the general relativistic Boltzmann
equation, we specialize to a conformally flat spacetime, which also serves as
the basis for four further limits. Two of these---the multidimensional special
relativistic case, and a conformally flat formulation of the spherically
symmetric general relativistic case---are given in appendices for the sake of
comparison with extant literature. The third limit is a weak-field,
`pseudo-Newtonian' approach \citep{kim_etal_2009,kim_etal_2012} in which the
source of the gravitational potential includes the trace of the stress-energy
tensor (rather than just the mass density), and all orders in fluid velocity
$v$ are retained. Our primary interest here is in the fourth limit:
`$\mathcal{O}(v)$' moment equations for use in conjunction with Newtonian
self-gravitating hydrodynamics. We show that the concept of `$\mathcal{O}(v)$'
transport requires care when dealing with both conservative four-momentum and
conservative lepton number transport, and present two self-consistent options:
`$\mathcal{O}(v)$-plus' transport, in which an $\mathcal{O}(v^2)$ energy
equation combines with an $\mathcal{O}(v)$ momentum equation to give an
$\mathcal{O}(v^2)$ number equation; and `$\mathcal{O}(v)$-minus' transport, in
which an $\mathcal{O}(v)$ energy equation combines with an $\mathcal{O}(1)$
momentum equation to give an $\mathcal{O}(v)$ number equation.

configurations to analyse the role of the relative orientation of the hedgehog
quills in the dynamics of the soliton-soliton interaction and investigate the
behaviour of these solutions in the range of long/intermediate distance. One of
the solutions is quite binding due to the dynamics of the {\pi} and {\sigma}
fields at intermediate distance and should be used for nuclear matter studies.
Since the product ansatz breaks down as the two solitons get close, we explore
the short range distance regime with a model that describes the interaction via
a six-quark bag ansatz. We calculate the interaction energy as a function of
the inter-soliton distance and show that for small separations the six quarks
bag, assuming a hedgehog structure, provides a stable bound state that at large
separations connects with a special configuration coming from the product
ansatz.

based on the existence of old neutron stars excluding the dark matter masses in
the range from $\sim 2$ keV up to several GeV. The constraints are based on the
star destruction scenario where the dark matter particles captured by the star
collapse forming a black hole that eventually consumes the host star. In
addition, there were claims in the literature that similar constraints can be
obtained for dark matter masses heavier than a few TeV. Here we argue that it
is not possible to extend to these constraints. We show that in the case of
heavy dark matter, instead of forming a single large black hole that consumes
the star, the collapsing dark matter particles form a series of small black
holes that evaporate fast without leading to the destruction of the star. Thus,
no constraints arise for bosonic asymmetric dark matter particles with masses
of a few TeV or higher.

differences. Then, We introduce a method that calculates the free energy
significantly faster since we need to use only one parameter, $T$. To implement
this method, we had to reach a regime in which the partition functions of the
two systems are equal, which isn't satisfied for systems that have different
entropies in the high temperature limit, so a solution to this problem had to
be found. Free energy values calculated for various interior loops are shown,
and may, if verified or with a more realistic modelling, be integrated into the
Vienna package and supply an alternative to the experiments done.

Kochen-Specker theorem seems either to concern particular examples of
contextuality, or be considered as quantum logic. Here, we develop a general
formalism for contextuality scenarios based on the combinatorics of hypergraphs
which significantly refines a similar recent approach by Cabello, Severini and
Winter (CSW). In contrast to CSW, we explicitly include the normalization of
probabilities, which gives us a much finer control over the various sets of
probabilistic models like classical, quantum and generalized probabilistic. In
particular, our framework specializes to (quantum) nonlocality in the case of
Bell scenarios, which arise very naturally from a certain product of
contextuality scenarios due to Foulis and Randall. In the spirit of CSW, we
find close relationships to several graph invariants. The recently proposed
Local Orthogonality principle turns out to be a special case of a general
principle for contextuality scenarios related to the Shannon capacity of
graphs. Our results imply that it is strictly dominated by a low level of the
Navascu\'es-Pironio-Ac\'in hierarchy of semidefinite programs, which we also
apply to contextuality scenarios.
  We derive a wealth of results in our framework, many of these relating to
quantum and supraquantum contextuality and nonlocality, and state numerous open
problems. For example, we show that the set of quantum models on a
contextuality scenario can in general not be characterized in terms of a graph
invariant.
  In terms of graph theory, our main result is this: there exist two graphs
$G_1$ and $G_2$ with the properties \begin{align*} \alpha(G_1) &= \Theta(G_1),

atmospheric thermal capacitance, subject to the radiative forcing of their

for the determination of a robust lower limit of atmospheric thickness. This
technique, together with the spectroscopic analysis of resolved planets from
their stars, both allowed by planned space and ground-based observatories with
thermal IR capabilities, would enable us with a better understanding of the
habitability of this class of planets. The technique works better for smaller
orbital periods, but since the tidal lock radius of M dwarfs encompasses their
HZ, the optimum targets would be planets around K dwarf stars. The atmospheric
thermal capacitance could also expand the range of Habitable Zones for shorter
orbits, particularly for planets around M dwarf stars, since the higher
frequency of the periodic radiative forcing dampens the surface temperature
variation considerably.

be used for protective as well as optical and electronic applications. However,
progressing target erosion during sputtering results in increased magnetic
field strengths at the target surface. Consequently, the glow discharge, the
target poisoning, and hence the morphology, crystal structure and stoichiometry
of the prepared thin films are influenced. Therefore, these effects were
investigated by varying the cathode current Im between 0.50 and 1.00 A, the
magnetic field strength B between 45 and 90 mT, and the O2/(Ar+O2) flow rate
ratio between 0 and 100%. With increasing oxygen flow ratio a
sub-stoichiometric TaOx oxide forms at the metallic Ta target surface which
further transfers to a non-conductive tantalum pentoxide Ta2O5, impeding a
stable DC glow discharge. These two transition zones (from Ta to TaOx and from
TaOx to Ta2O5) shift to higher oxygen flow rates for increasing target
currents. Contrary, increasing the magnetic field strength (e.g., due to
sputter erosion) mainly shifts the TaOx to Ta2O5 transition to lower oxygen
flow rates while marginally influencing the Ta to TaOx transition. To allow for
a stable DC glow discharge (and to suppress the formation of non-conductive
Ta2O5 at the target) even at a flow rate ratio of 100% either a high target
current (Im >= 1 A) or a low magnetic field strength (B <= 60 mT) is necessary.
These conditions are required to prepare stoichiometric and fully crystalline
Ta2O5 films. Our investigations clearly demonstrate the importance of the
magnetic field strength, which changes during sputter erosion, on the target
poisoning and the resulting film quality.

  In the context of dual superconductors, these objects represent different

containing a monopole can bind quarks in a color nonsinglet state to form an
overall neutral object, identified with a hybrid hadron. These states, formed
by quarks bound to a valence gluon, are allowed by QCD, and current
experimental collaborations are aimed at identifying them. Finally, considering
the general version of the model, based on a compact simple gauge group G, the

convexity property of dimensions of spinning operators of the original CFT. We
further investigate the dimensions of spinning operators via the crossing
equations in the light-cone limit. We find that, in a sense, CFTs become free
at large spin and 1/s is a weak coupling parameter. The spectrum of CFTs enjoys
additivity: if two twists tau_1, tau_2 appear in the spectrum, there are
operators whose twists are arbitrarily close to tau_1+tau_2. We characterize
how tau_1+tau_2 is approached at large spin by solving the crossing equations
analytically. We find the precise form of the leading correction, including the
prefactor. We compare with examples where these observables were computed in
perturbation theory, or via gauge-gravity duality, and find complete agreement.
The crossing equations show that certain operators have a convex spectrum in
twist space. We also observe a connection between convexity and the ratio of
dimension to charge. Applications include the 3d Ising model, theories with a
gravity dual, SCFTs, and patterns of higher spin symmetry breaking.

upon the status of other loci. Such epistatic interactions among loci are now
recognized as fundamental to shaping the process of adaptation in evolving
populations. Although little is known about the structure of epistasis in most
organisms, recent experiments with bacterial populations have concluded that
antagonistic interactions abound and tend to de-accelerate the pace of
adaptation over time. Here, we use a broad class of mathematical fitness
landscapes to examine how natural selection biases the mutations that
substitute during evolution based on their epistatic interactions. We find
that, even when beneficial mutations are rare, these biases are strong and
change substantially throughout the course of adaptation. In particular,
epistasis is less prevalent than the neutral expectation early in adaptation
and much more prevalent later, with a concomitant shift from predominantly
antagonistic interactions early in adaptation to synergistic and sign epistasis
later in adaptation. We observe the same patterns when re-analyzing data from a
recent microbial evolution experiment. Since these biases depend on the
population size and other parameters, they must be quantified before we can
hope to use experimental data to infer an organism's underlying fitness
landscape or to understand the role of epistasis in shaping its adaptation. In
particular, we show that when the order of substitutions is not known to an
experimentalist, then standard methods of analysis may suggest that epistasis
retards adaptation when in fact it accelerates it.

results were successfully validated. To demonstrate its capabilities, we
compared the FST distributions of GenoChip SNPs to those of two commercial

Neugebauer [J. Chem. Phys. 126, 134116 (2007)10.1063/1.2713754]. The other
yields Dyson type equations involving three types of subsystem response
functions: coupled, uncoupled, and Kohn-Sham. The Dyson type equations for
subsystem TD-DFT are derived here for the first time. The response function
formalism reveals previously hidden qualities and complications of subsystem
TD-DFT compared with the regular TD-DFT of the supersystem. For example,
analysis of the pole structure of the subsystem response functions shows that
each function contains information about the electronic spectrum of the entire
supersystem. In addition, comparison of the subsystem and supersystem response
functions shows that, while the correlated response is subsystem additive, the
Kohn-Sham response is not. Comparison with the non-subjective partition DFT
theory shows that this non-additivity is largely an artifact introduced by the
subjective nature of the density partitioning in subsystem DFT.

accurately estimate population genetic parameters without confounding by SNP
ascertainment bias. One such statistic of interest is the proportion of
heterozygous sites within an individual's genome, which is informative about
inbreeding and effective population size. However, in many cases, the available
sequence data of an individual is limited to low coverage, preventing the
confident calling of genotypes necessary to directly count the proportion of
heterozygous sites. Here, we present a method for estimating an individual's
genome-wide rate of heterozygosity from low-coverage sequence data, without an
intermediate step calling genotypes. Our method jointly learns the shared
allele distribution between the individual and a panel of other individuals,
together with the sequencing error distributions and the reference bias. We
show our method works well, first by its performance on simulated sequence
data, and secondly on real sequence data where we obtain estimates using low
coverage data consistent with those from higher coverage. We apply our method
to obtain estimates of the rate of heterozygosity for 11 humans from diverse
world-wide populations, and through this analysis reveal the complex dependency
of local sequencing coverage on the true underlying heterozygosity, which
complicates the estimation of heterozygosity from sequence data. We show
filters can correct for the confounding by sequencing depth. We find in
practice that ratios of heterozygosity are more interpretable than absolute
estimates, and show that we obtain excellent conformity of ratios of
heterozygosity with previous estimates from higher coverage data.

ionization and recombination of plasma during the rise of a convection zone

Hydrogen allows the effective flow of mass across fieldlines, by the addition
of a Pedersen resistivity to the generalized Ohm's law, which dissipates
current perpendicular to the magnetic field. This causes an increase of up to
10% in the amount of magnetic in-plane flux supplied to the corona and a
reduction of up to 89% in the amount of sub-surface plasma brought up into the
corona. However, it also reduces the amount of free magnetic energy supplied to
the corona, and thus does not positively affect the likelihood of creating

class of nonlinear scalar-tensor theories. These theories are invariant under:
(a) linear diffeomorphisms which represent an exact symmetry of the full
non-linear action, and (b) global field-space Galilean transformations of the
scalar field. The Lagrangian contains a set of non-topological interaction
terms of the above-mentioned dimensionality, which we show are not renormalized
at any order in perturbation theory. We also discuss the renormalization of
other operators, that may be generated by loops and/or receive
loop-corrections, and identify the regime in which they are sub-leading with
respect to the operators that do not get renormalized. Interestingly, such
scalar-tensor theories emerge in a certain high-energy limit of the ghost-free
theory of massive gravity. One can use the non-renormalization properties of
the high-energy limit to estimate the magnitude of quantum corrections in the
full theory. We show that the quantum corrections to the three free parameters
of the model, one of them being the graviton mass, are strongly suppressed. In

$f(G*H)$ where $G$ and $H$ are graphs, * is a graph product and $f$ is a graph
property. For example, if $f$ is the independence number and * is the
disjunctive product, then the product is known to be multiplicative:
$f(G*H)=f(G)f(H)$.
  In this paper, we study graph products in the following non-standard form:
$f((G\oplus H)*J)$ where $G$, $H$ and $J$ are graphs, $\oplus$ and * are two
different graph products and $f$ is a graph property. We show that if $f$ is

subadditive.

stellar mass for almost 260,000 locally brightest galaxies (LBGs) selected from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). These are predominantly the central
galaxies of their dark matter halos. We calibrate the stellar-to-halo mass
conversion using realistic mock catalogues based on the Millennium Simulation.
Applying a multi-frequency matched filter to the Planck data for each LBG, and
averaging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean SZ signal
down to $M_\ast\sim 2\times 10^{11} \Msolar$, with a clear indication of signal
at even lower stellar mass. We derive the scaling relation between SZ signal
and halo mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the real
LBGs and simulating the Planck observation process. This relation shows no
evidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range extending from
rich clusters down to $M_{500}\sim 2\times 10^{13} \Msolar$, and there is a
clear indication of signal down to $M_{500}\sim 4\times 10^{12} \Msolar$.
Planck's SZ detections in such low-mass halos imply that about a quarter of all
baryons have now been seen in the form of hot halo gas, and that this gas must
be less concentrated than the dark matter in such halos in order to remain
consistent with X-ray observations. At the high-mass end, the measured SZ

understand how these galaxies have assembled their mass. One key observational
result of the last years is that massive galaxies increased their size by a
factor of a few at fixed stellar mass from $z\sim2$. Hierarchical models favor
minor mergers as a plausible driver of this size growth. Some of these models,
predict a significant environmental dependence in the sense that galaxies
residing in more massive halos tend to be larger than galaxies in lower mass
halos, at fixed stellar mass and redshift. At present, observational results of
this environmental dependence have been contradictory. In this paper we revisit
this issue in the local Universe, by investigating how the sizes of massive
ETGs depend on large-scale environment using an updated and accurate sample of
ETGs in different environments - field, group, clusters - from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey DR7. Our analysis does not show any significant
environmental dependence of the sizes of central and satellites ETGs at fixed
stellar mass at $z\sim0$. The size-mass relation of early-type galaxies at
$z\sim0$ seems to be universal, i.e., independent of the mass of the host halo
and of the position of the galaxy in that halo (central or satellite). The
result is robust to different galaxy selections based on star formation,
morphology or central density. In fact, considering our observational errors
and the size of the sample, any size ratio larger than $30-40%$ between massive
galaxies ($log(M_*/M_\odot)>11$) living in clusters and in the field can be
ruled out at $3\sigma$ level.

this end we have obtained VLT/X-shooter spectra of HH 1042 and HH 1043, two
newly discovered jets in the massive star-forming region RCW 36. HH 1042 is
associated with the intermediate-mass YSO 08576nr292. Over 90 emission lines
are detected in the spectra. High-velocity (up to 220 km/s) blue- and
redshifted emission from a bipolar flow is observed in typical shock tracers.
Low-velocity emission from the background cloud is detected in nebular tracers,
including lines from high ionization species. We applied combined optical and
infrared spectral diagnostic tools in order to derive the physical conditions
(density, temperature, and ionization) in the jets. The measured mass outflow
rates are Mjet ~ 10^-7 Msun/yr. We measure a high accretion rate for HH 1042
(Macc ~ 10^-6 Msun/yr) and Mjet/Macc ~ 0.1, comparable to low-mass sources and
consistent with models for magneto-centrifugal jet launching. The knotted
structure and velocity spread in both jets are interpreted as fossil signatures
of a variable outflow rate. The mean velocities in both lobes of the jets are
comparable, but the variations in Mjet and velocity in the two lobes are not
symmetric, suggesting that the launching mechanism on either side of the
accretion disk is not synchronized. For HH 1042, we have constructed an
interpretative physical model with a stochastic or periodic outflow rate and a
description of a ballistic flow as its constituents. The knotted structure and
velocity spread can be reproduced qualitatively with the model, indicating that
the outflow velocity varies on timescales on the order of 100 yr.

lines of Sr, they can be detected even in the most metal-poor stars and also in
low-resolution spectra. However, we still cannot explain the large star-to-star
abundance scatter we derive for metal-poor stars. Here we contrast Galactic
chemical evolution (GCE) with improved abundances for SrI+II including updated
atomic data, to evaluate possible explanations for the large star-to-star
scatter at low metallicities. We derive abundances under both local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE (NLTE) for stars spanning a large
interval of stellar parameters. Gravities and metallicities are also determined
in NLTE. We confirm that the ionisation equilibrium between SrI and SrII is
satisfied under NLTE but not LTE, where the difference between SrI and SrII is
on average ~0.3dex. We show that the NLTE corrections are of increasing
importance as the metallicity decreases. For the stars with [Fe/H]>-3 the SrI
NLTE correction is ~0.35/0.55dex in dwarfs/giants, while the Sr II NLTE
correction is +/-0.05dex. On the basis of the large NLTE corrections, SrI
should not be applied as a chemical tracer under LTE, while it is a good tracer
under NLTE. SrII is a good tracer under both LTE and NLTE (down to [Fe/H]\sim
-3), and LTE is a safe assumption for this majority species. However, the Sr
abundance from SrII lines is dependent on an accurate surface gravity
determination, which can be obtained from NLTE spectroscopy of Fe lines or from
parallax measurements. We could not explain the star-to-star scatter (which
remains under both LTE and NLTE) by the use of the GCE model, since the Sr
yields to date are too uncertain to draw firm conclusions. At least two
production sites seem necessary in order to account for this large scatter

of the Galactic centre. The Galactic tidal forces acting on planets scale
inversely with radius in the Galaxy and so are much greater in the inner Galaxy
than in the Solar neighbourhood. Within a range of 3.5 to 10 kpc, the vertical
tide from the Galactic disc is predominant. Interior to 3.5 kpc, the effects of
the Galactic bulge cannot be neglected and the in-plane tidal components are as
important as the vertical ones. Here, we quantify the orbital changes induced
by these tides. We find that the greatest perturbations occur when the
planetary orbit is severely misaligned to the parent star's orbit. When both
planes are perpendicular, the eccentricity of the planet is driven to unity,
although the semimajor axis is secularly unaffected. When both planes are
coincident, the effect from Galactic tides is minimized, but remains non-zero.
In these cases, we provide estimates for the survival times, as well as the
minimum baseline eccentricity variation for all Milky Way exoplanets as a
function of Galactic parameters. Inclinations similar to the Solar System's
(about 60 degrees) can easily cause eccentric Neptunes (at about 30 AU) around
host stars deep within the Galactic bulge (within 50 pc) to experience
eccentricity variations of several tenths, and cause the exoplanets with the
widest-known separations (at about 1000 AU) to experience similar variations in
the Galactic disc. These variations occur on timescales of a few Gyr, a

period of six months, ranging from June 2010 to December 2010. We detect strong
absorption variability on time scales between 1.5 and 4 months, suggesting that
the obscuring material consists of gas clouds at parsec-scale distance. The
lack of significant variability on shorter time scales suggests that this event
is not due to absorption by broad line region clouds, which was instead found
in other studies of similar sources. This shows that a single, universal

enough to reproduce the observed complexity of the X-ray absorption features of

used to map the star formation rate surface density (\Sigma_{SFR}). We estimate
the molecular gas surface density (\Sigma_{H2}) from \Sigma_{SFR} by inverting
the molecular star formation law (SFL), and compare it to the CO intensity to
measure Xco. We study the impact of systematic uncertainties by changing the
slope of the SFL, using different SFR tracers (H\alpha vs. far-UV plus 24\mu
m), and CO maps from different telescopes (single-dish and interferometers).
The observed Xco profile is robust against these systematics, drops by a factor
of 2 from R~7 kpc to the center of the galaxy, and is well fit by a gradient
\Delta log(Xco)=0.06\pm0.02 dex kpc^-1. We study how changes in Xco follow
changes in metallicity, gas density, and ionization parameter. Theoretical
models show that the gradient in Xco can be explained by a combination of
decreasing metallicity, and decreasing \Sigma_{H2} with radius. Photoelectric
heating from the local UV radiation field appears to contribute to the decrease
of Xco in higher density regions. Our results show that galactic environment
plays an important role at setting the physical conditions in star forming
regions, in particular the chemistry of carbon in molecular complexes, and the
radiative transfer of CO emission. We caution against adopting a single Xco
value when large changes in gas surface density or metallicity are present.

types of events which they produce. Using all known historical supernovae, we
split host galaxies into samples containing single or multiple events. These
samples are then characterised in terms of their relative supernova fractions,
and host properties. In multiple supernova hosts the ratio of type Ia to
core-collapse events is lower than in single supernova hosts. For core-collapse
events there is a suggestion that the ratio of types Ibc to type II events is
higher in multiples than within single supernova hosts. This second increase is
dominated by an increase in the number of SNIb. Within multiple supernova
hosts, supernovae of any given type appear to 'prefer' to explode in galaxies
that are host to the same type of SN. We also find that multiple SN hosts have
higher T-type morphologies. While our results suffer from low number
statistics, we speculate that their simplest interpretation is that star
formation within galaxies is generally of an episodic and bursty nature. This
leads to the supernovae detected within any particular galaxy to be dominated
by those with progenitors of a specific age, rather than a random selection
from standard relative supernova rates, as the latter would be expected if star
formation was of a long-term continuous nature. We further discuss the
supernova progenitor and star formation properties that may be important for
understanding these trends, and also comment on a range of important selection
effects within our sample.

  The purpose of this study is to search for diffuse non-thermal X-ray emission
around PSR J0855-4644 to test for the presence of a PWN and to estimate the
distance to the pulsar. An X-ray observation was carried out with the
XMM-Newton satellite to constrain the properties of the pulsar and its nebula.
The absorption column density derived in X-rays from the pulsar and from
different regions of the rim of the SNR was compared with the absorption
derived from the atomic (HI) and molecular (12CO) gas distribution along the
corresponding lines of sight to estimate the distance of the pulsar and of the
SNR.
  The observation has revealed the X-ray counterpart of the pulsar together
with surrounding extended emission thus confirming the existence of a PWN. The
comparison of column densities provided an upper limit to the distance of the

this is less than 10% for most of the haloes. However, even this small
difference in mass corresponds to a significant difference in shape. We
quantify these effects also on the initial mass and deformation tensors, on
which most models of triaxial collapse are based. By studying the properties of
protohaloes in the initial conditions, we find that models in which protohaloes
are identified in Lagrangian space by three positive eigenvalues of the
deformation tensor are tenable only at the masses well-above $M_*$. The
overdensity $\delta$ within almost any protohalo is larger than the critical
value associated with spherical collapse (increasing as mass decreases); this
is in good qualitative agreement with models which identify haloes requiring
that collapse have occured along all three principal axes, each axis having
turned around from the universal expansion at a different time. The
distributions of initial values are in agreement with the simplest predictions
associated with ellipsoidal collapse, assuming initially spherical protohaloes,
collapsed around random positions which were sufficiently overdense. However,
most protohaloes are not spherical and departures from sphericity increase as

thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) and massive red super giant
(RSG) stars to the luminosities of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC
and SMC, respectively). Combined, the peak contribution from these cool evolved
stars occurs at ~3-4 um, where they produce 32% of the SMC light, and 25% of
the LMC flux. The TP-AGB star contribution also peaks at ~3-4 um and amounts to
21% in both galaxies. The contribution from RSG stars peaks at shorter
wavelengths, 2.2 um, where they provide 11% of the SMC flux, and 7% for the
LMC. Both TP-AGB and RSG stars are short lived, and thus potentially impose a
large stochastic scatter on the near-IR derived mass-to-light ratios of
galaxies at rest-frame 1-4 um. To minimize their impact on stellar mass
estimates, one can use the M/L ratio at shorter wavelengths (e.g. at 0.8 - 1
um). At longer wavelengths (>=8 um), emission from dust in the interstellar
medium dominates the flux. In the LMC, which shows strong PAH emission at 8 um,
TP-AGB and RSG contribute less than 4% of the 8 um flux. However, 19% of the
SMC 8 um flux is from evolved stars, nearly half of which is produced by the
rarest, dustiest, carbon-rich TP-AGB stars. Thus, star formation rates of
galaxies, based on an 8 um flux (e.g. observed-frame 24 um at z=2), may be
biased modestly high, especially for galaxies with little PAH emission.

the first direct detailed comparison of our model to CO(1-0) and far-infrared

body of the cloud, we derive total hydrogen volume densities of \approx 430
cm-3, consistent with the extensive literature available on Taurus. The
distribution of the volume densities shows a log-normal shape with a hint of a
power-law shape on the high density end. We convert our volume densities to H2
column densities assuming a cloud depth of 5 parsec and compare these column
densities to observed CO emission. We find a slope equivalent to a CO
conversion factor relation that is on the low end of reported values for this
factor in the literature (0.9 x 1020 cm-2 (K km s-1)-1), although this value is
directly proportional to our assumed value of G0 as well as the cloud depth. We
seem to under-predict the total hydrogen gas as compared to 100 {\mu}m dust
emission, which we speculate may be caused by a higher actual G0 incident on
the Taurus cloud than is generally assumed.

horizons in the gravitational aether theory, a semi-classical solution to the
cosmological constant problem(s), and thus suggests a catastrophic breakdown of
general relativity close to black hole event horizons. A similar picture
emerges in fuzzball models of black holes in string theory, as well as the
recent firewall proposal to resolve the information paradox. We then
demonstrate that positing a surface fluid in thermal equilibrium with Hawking
radiation, with vanishing energy density (but non-vanishing pressure) at the
new boundary of spacetime, which is required by Israel junction conditions,
yields a thermodynamic entropy that is identical to the Bekenstein-Hawking area
law, $S_{BH}$, for charged rotating black holes. To our knowledge, this is the
first derivation of black hole entropy which only employs local thermodynamics.
Furthermore, a model for the microscopic degrees of freedom of the surface
fluid (which constitute the micro-states of the black hole) is suggested, which
has a finite, but Lorentz-violating, quantum field theory. Finally, we comment
on the effects of physical boundary on Hawking radiation, and show that
relaxing the assumption of equilibrium with Hawking radiation sets $S_{BH}$ as
an upper limit for Black Hole entropy.

  BioAmbient calculus is an extension of \pi-calculus, developed largely for
applications to biomolecular systems. It deals with ambients and their ability
to communicate and to execute concurrent processes while moving.
  In this paper we combine the formalism of Dynamic Epistemic Logic together
with the formalism of BioAmbient Calculus in order to reason about knowledge
maintained and gained upon process transitions. The motivation lies in
developing a language that captures locally available information through
assignment of knowledge, with potential application to biological systems as
well as social, virtual, and others.
  We replace the ambients of BioAmbient Calculus with agents, to which we
attribute knowledge, and explore the parallels of this treatment. The resulting
logic describes the information flow governing mobile structured agents,
organized hierarchically, whose architecture (and local information) may change
due to actions such as communication, merging (of two agents), entering (of an
agent into the inner structure of another agent) and exiting (of an agent from
the structure of another). We show how the main axioms of DEL must be altered
to accommodate the informational effects of the agents' dynamic architecture.

Those confirmed and candidate clusters with available near infrared photometry
display evidence for a red sequence galaxy population, determined either

and also in $D=2+1$ have been constructed in a non-perturbative way. That was
done in the so-called {\it constructive quantum field theory} approach, whose
main results have been obtained by a clever use of Euclidean functional
methods. Although in the construction of a single model there are several
technical steps, some of them involving long proofs, the constructive quantum
field theory approach contains conceptual insights about relativistic quantum
field theory that deserved to be known and which are accessible without
entering in technical details. The purpose of this note is to illustrate such
insights by providing an oversimplified schematic exposition of the simple case
of $\lambda\Phi^4$ (with $m>0$) in $D=1+1$. Because of the absence of
ultraviolet divergences in its perturbative version, this simple example
-although does not capture all the difficulties in the constructive quantum
field theory approach- allows to stress those difficulties inherent to the
non-perturbative definition. We have made an effort in order to avoid several

(WD/dM) binaries from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7) to investigate
relations between magnetic activity, rotation, magnetic braking and age in M
stars. These relations are studied separately for close WD/dM binaries that
underwent a common envelope phase and thus contain tidally locked and hence
rapidly rotating M dwarfs, and for wide WD/dM binaries that never interacted.
For the wide WD/dM binary sample we find that the M dwarf activity fractions
are significantly higher than those measured in single M stars of spectral type
M0 to M5. We attribute this effect as a consequence of M dwarfs in wide SDSS
WD/dM binaries being, on average, significantly younger and hence more active
than the field M dwarf population. The measured M dwarf activity fractions in
wide WD/dM binaries show as well a significant increase from spectral types M3
to M5, where these low-mass stars become fully convective. This provides
additional observational evidence for magnetic braking being less efficient
below the fully convective boundary, in agreement with the hypothesis of fully
convective stars having considerably longer activity lifetimes than partially
convective stars. The M dwarfs in all our close binaries are active,
independently of the spectral type, giving robust observational evidence for
magnetic activity being enhanced due to fast rotation. The rotational
velocities of the M dwarfs in our close binary sample are significantly higher
than seen among field M dwarfs, however the strength of magnetic activity
remains saturated at log LHalpha/Lbol approximately -3.5. This unambiguously
confirms the M dwarf saturation-type rotation-activity relation.

  Networks: A Spectral Analysis","7 pages",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI math.DS physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In epidemic modeling, the term infection strength indicates the ratio of
infection rate and cure rate. If the infection strength is higher than a
certain threshold -- which we define as the epidemic threshold - then the
epidemic spreads through the population and persists in the long run. For a
single generic graph representing the contact network of the population under
consideration, the epidemic threshold turns out to be equal to the inverse of
the spectral radius of the contact graph. However, in a real world scenario it
is not possible to isolate a population completely: there is always some
interconnection with another network, which partially overlaps with the contact
network. Results for epidemic threshold in interconnected networks are limited
to homogeneous mixing populations and degree distribution arguments. In this
paper, we adopt a spectral approach. We show how the epidemic threshold in a
given network changes as a result of being coupled with another network with
fixed infection strength. In our model, the contact network and the
interconnections are generic. Using bifurcation theory and algebraic graph
theory, we rigorously derive the epidemic threshold in interconnected networks.
These results have implications for the broad field of epidemic modeling and
control. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.

constraints limiting: i) the long-term (ergodic) capacity loss caused to each
PU receiver; ii) the long-term interference power at each PU receiver; and iii)
the long-term power at each SU transmitter. Formulations accounting for
short-term counterparts of i) and ii) are also discussed. Although the
long-term capacity constraints are non-convex, the resultant optimization
problem exhibits zero-duality gap and can be efficiently solved in the dual
domain. The optimal allocation schemes (power and rate loadings, frequency
bands to be accessed, and SU links to be activated) are a function of the CSI
of the primary and secondary networks as well as the Lagrange multipliers
associated with the long-term constraints. The optimal resource allocation
algorithms are first designed under the assumption that the CSI is perfect,

infer properties of a represented stimulus space without knowledge of the
receptive fields, using only the intrinsic structure of the neural code. How
does the brain do this? To address this question, it is important to determine
what stimulus space features can - in principle - be extracted from neural
codes. This motivates us to define the neural ring and a related neural ideal,
algebraic objects that encode the full combinatorial data of a neural code. Our
main finding is that these objects can be expressed in a ""canonical form"" that
directly translates to a minimal description of the receptive field structure
intrinsic to the code. We also find connections to Stanley-Reisner rings, and
use ideas similar to those in the theory of monomial ideals to obtain an
algorithm for computing the primary decomposition of pseudo-monomial ideals.
This allows us to algorithmically extract the canonical form associated to any

underdetermined set of linear measurements? Addressing this question is the
first step towards applying compression algorithms for compressed sensing (CS).
In this paper, we consider a family of compression algorithms $\mathcal{C}_r$,
parametrized by rate $r$, for a compact class of signals $\mathcal{Q} \subset
\mathds{R}^n$. The set of natural images and JPEG at different rates are
examples of $\mathcal{Q}$ and $\mathcal{C}_r$, respectively. We establish a
connection between the rate-distortion performance of $\mathcal{C}_r$, and the
number of linear measurements required for successful recovery in CS. We then
propose compressible signal pursuit (CSP) algorithm and prove that, with high
probability, it accurately and robustly recovers signals from an
underdetermined set of linear measurements. We also explore the performance of
CSP in the recovery of infinite dimensional signals.

QBOP is strongly NP-hard even if the family of feasible solutions has a very

presented. Results of extensive computational experiments are reported using
randomly generated quadratic knapsack problems as the test bed. These results
illustrate the efficacy of our exact and heuristic algorithms. We also show
that when the cost matrix is specially structured, QBOP can be solved as a
sequence of linear balanced optimization problems. As a consequence, we have
several polynomially solvable cases of QBOP.

  {array}. {equation*} Under the assumption that the support of the
axisymmetric initial data $\rho_{0}(r,z)$ does not intersect the axis $(Oz)$,
we prove the global well-posedness for this system with axisymmetric initial
data. We first show the growth of the quantity $\frac\rho r$ for large time by
taking advantage of characteristic of transport equation. This growing property
together with the horizontal smoothing effect enables us to establish
$H^1$-estimate of the velocity via the $L^2$-energy estimate of velocity and
the Maximum principle of density. Based on this, we further establish the
estimate for the quantity $\|\omega(t)\|_{\sqrt{\mathbb{L}}}:=\sup_{2\leq
p<\infty}\frac{\norm{\omega(t)}_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)}}{\sqrt{p}}<\infty$ which
implies $\|\nabla u(t)\|_{\mathbb{L}^{3/2}}:=\sup_{2\leq
p<\infty}\frac{\norm{\nabla u(t)}_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)}}{p\sqrt{p}}<\infty$.
However, this regularity for the flow admits forbidden singularity since $
\mathbb{L}$ (see \eqref{eq-kl} for the definition) seems be the minimum space
for the gradient vector field $u(x,t)$ ensuring uniqueness of flow. To bridge
this gap, we exploit the space-time estimate about $ \sup_{2\leq
p<\infty}\int_0^t\frac{\|\nabla
u(\tau)\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)}}{\sqrt{p}}\mathrm{d}\tau<\infty$ by making good
use of the horizontal smoothing effect and micro-local techniques. The global
well-posedness for the large initial data is achieved by establishing a new
type space-time logarithmic inequality.

main result in this paper is that the Phanerozoic biodiversity evolution has

a Kramers pair of Majorana edge (bound) states. For a Josephson pi-junction we
predict a Majorana quartet that is protected by mirror symmetry and leads to a
mirror fractional Josephson effect. We analyze the evolution of Majorana pair

liquid-solid profile and the underlying microscopic crystalline structure are
studied in the phase-field-crystal (PFC) model. Such scale coupling leads to
nonadiabatic corrections to the PFC amplitude equations, the effect of which
increases strongly with decreasing system temperature below the melting point.
This nonadiabatic amplitude representation is further coarse-grained for the
derivation of effective sharp-interface equations of motion in the limit of
small but finite interface thickness. We identify a generalized form of the
Gibbs-Thomson relation with the incorporation of coupling and pinning effects
of the crystalline lattice structure. This generalized interface equation can
be reduced to the form of a driven sine-Gordon equation with KPZ nonlinearity,
and be combined with other two dynamic equations in the sharp interface limit
obeying the conservation condition of atomic number density in a liquid-solid
system. A sample application to the study of crystal layer growth is given, and
the corresponding analytic solutions showing lattice pinning and depinning
effects and two distinct modes of continuous vs. nucleated growth are
presented. We also identify the universal scaling behaviors governing the
properties of pinning strength, surface tension, interface kinetic coefficient,
and activation energy of atomic layer growth, which accommodate all range of

luminosity from single O-stars scales linearly with bolometric luminosity, Lx ~
10^{-7} Lbol. But straightforward forms of the most favored model, in which
X-rays arise from instability-generated shocks embedded in the stellar wind,
predict a steeper scaling, either with mass loss rate Lx ~ Mdot ~ Lbol^{1.7} if
the shocks are radiative, or with Lx ~ Mdot^{2} ~ Lbol^{3.4} if they are
adiabatic. This paper presents a generalized formalism that bridges these
radiative vs. adiabatic limits in terms of the ratio of the shock cooling
length to the local radius. Noting that the thin-shell instability of radiative
shocks should lead to extensive mixing of hot and cool material, we propose
that the associated softening and weakening of the X-ray emission can be
parametrized as scaling with the cooling length ratio raised to a power m$, the
""mixing exponent"". For physically reasonable values m ~= 0.4, this leads to an
X-ray luminosity Lx ~ Mdot^{0.6} ~ Lbol that matches the empirical scaling. To
fit observed X-ray line profiles, we find such radiative-shock-mixing models
require the number of shocks to drop sharply above the initial shock onset
radius. This in turn implies that the X-ray luminosity should saturate and even
decrease for optically thick winds with very high mass-loss rates. In the
opposite limit of adiabatic shocks in low-density winds (e.g., from B-stars),
the X-ray luminosity should drop steeply with Mdot^2. Future numerical
simulation studies will be needed to test the general thin-shell mixing ansatz
for X-ray emission.

information, though commonly known relations pertain to a pair of observables.
We present novel uncertainty and certainty relations of state-independent form
for the three Pauli observables with use of the Tsallis $\alpha$-entropies. For
all real $\alpha\in(0;1]$ and integer $\alpha\geq2$, lower bounds on the sum of
three $\alpha$-entropies are obtained. These bounds are tight in the sense that
they are always reached with certain pure states. The necessary and sufficient
condition for equality is that the qubit state is an eigenstate of one of the
Pauli observables. Using concavity with respect to the parameter $\alpha$, we
derive approximate lower bounds for non-integer $\alpha\in(1;+\infty)$. In the
case of pure states, the developed method also allows to obtain upper bounds on
the entropic sum for real $\alpha\in(0;1]$ and integer $\alpha\geq2$. For
applied purposes, entropic bounds are often used with averaging over the
individual entropies. Combining the obtained bounds leads to a band, in which
the rescaled average $\alpha$-entropy ranges in the pure-state case. A width of
this band is essentially dependent on $\alpha$. It can be interpreted as an
evidence for sensitivity in quantifying the complementarity.

Instabilities of a partial cavity developed on an hydrofoil, a

study is to evaluate a passive control method of the sheet cavity. According to
operating conditions, cavitation can be described by two different regimes: an
unstable regime with a cloud cavitation shedding and a stable regime with only
a pulsating sheet cavity. Avoiding cloud cavitation can limit structure damages
since a pulsating sheet cavity is less agressive. The surface condition of a
converging-diverging step, like a Venturi-type obstacle, is here studied as a
solution for a passive control of the cavitation. This study discusses the
effect of an organized roughness, in the shape of longitudinal grooves, on the
developed sheet cavity. Analyzes conducted with Laser Doppler Velocimetry,
visualisations and pressure measurements show that the grooves geometry, and
especially the groove depth, acts on the sheet cavity dynamics. Results show
that modifying the surface condition, by varying the grooves geometry, can
reduce cavity sheet length and even suppress the cloud cavitation shedding.

aspect of a Sturm-Liouville problem, and that the cosmological constant,
$\Lambda$, plays thereby the role of spectral parameter (what hints to its
connection with the Casimir effect). The subsequent formulation of appropriate
boundary conditions leads to a set of admissible values for $\Lambda$,
considered as eigenvalues of the corresponding linear operator. Simplest
boundary conditions are assumed, namely that the eigenfunctions belong to $L^2$
space, with the result that, when all energy conditions are satisfied, they
yield a discrete spectrum for $\Lambda>0$ and a continuous one for $\Lambda<0$.
A very interesting situation is seen to occur when the discrete spectrum
contains only one point: then, there is the possibility to obtain appropriate
cosmological conditions without invoking the anthropic principle. This
possibility is shown to be realized in cyclic cosmological models, provided the
potential of the matter field is similar to the potential of the scalar field.
The dynamics of the universe in this case contains a sudden future singularity.

carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars, although many of these objects have
been studied in detail both photometrically and spectroscopically. We aim to
derive polarimetric properties for a large sample of CEMP stars and CH stars to
fill this gap. Multiband polarimetric observations were conducted in the first
run for a sample of twenty-nine objects that include twenty-two CEMP and CH
stars and seven polarization standards. Estimates of polarization were obtained
using standard procedures of polarization calculation. Five objects in our
sample do not show any significant polarization over the different colours of
BVRI. For the rest of the objects the derived percentage polarization estimates
are less than or equal to 1%, and they are found to exhibit random behaviour
with respect to the inverse of the effective wavelength of observations.
Polarization also does not seem to have any correlation with the effective
temperatures of the stars. Our polarimetric estimates indicate there are
circumstellar envelopes around these stars that are spherically symmetric or
envelopes with little or no dust. In the plane of differential polarization,
defined as the difference between the maximum and the minimum polarizations
within the BVRI-bands, versus their visual magnitude, the stars appear to be
confined to a narrow band. The implication of this trend for understanding the
nature of the circumstellar environment remains to be determined and requires
detailed modelling.

In this approach, there is a wave function that leads to a quantum potential.
This potential can explain the relevance and entanglements of the agent's
behaviors with the past. The light is shed by considering the relevance of the
market conditions with the previous market conditions enabling the conversion
of the local concepts to the global ones. We have shown that there are two
potential limits for each market. In essence, these potential limits act as a
boundary which limits the return values inside it. By estimating the difference
between these two limits in each market, it is found that the quantum
potentials of the return time series in different time scales, possess a
scaling behavior. The slopes of the scaling behaviors in mature, emerging and
commodity markets show different patterns. The emerge market having a slope
greater than 0.5, has a higher value compared to the corresponding values for
the mature and commodity markets which is less than 0.5. The cut-off observed
in the curve of the commodity market indicates the threshold for the efficiency
of the global effects. While before the cut-off, local effects in the market
are dominant, as in the case of the mature markets. The findings could prove
adequate for investors in different markets to invest in different time

motions of the progenitor systems in which they formed, making it possible to
trace the mass-assembly history of the Galaxy. Direct measurement of
three-dimensional velocities, based on accurate proper motions and
line-of-sight velocities, has revealed that the majority of halo stars in the
inner-halo region move on eccentric orbits. However, our understanding of the
motions of distant, in-situ halo-star samples is still limited, due to the lack
of accurate proper motions for these stars. Here we explore a model-independent
analysis of the line-of-sight velocities and spatial distribution of a recent
sample of 1865 carefully selected halo blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars
within 30 kpc of the Galactic center. We find that the mean rotational velocity
of the very metal-poor ([Fe/H] < -2.0) BHB stars significantly lags behind that
of the relatively more metal-rich ([Fe/H] > -2.0) BHB stars. We also find that
the relatively more metal-rich BHB stars are dominated by stars with eccentric
orbits, as previously observed for other stellar samples in the inner-halo
region. By contrast, the very metal-poor BHB stars are dominated by stars on
rounder, lower-eccentricity orbits. Our results indicate that the motion of the
progenitor systems of the Milky Way that contributed to the stellar populations
found within 30 kpc correlates directly with their metal abundance, which may
be related to their physical properties such as gas fractions. These results
are consistent with the existence of an inner/outer halo structure for the halo
system, as advocated by Carollo et al. (2010).

networks. In formal mathematical terms, it concerns the distribution of triad
configurations in actual networks compared to random networks of the same edge
density. On reading Charles Kadushin's recent book ""Understanding Social
Networks"", we were struck by the amount of confusion in the presentation of
this concept in the early sections of the book. This confusion seems to lie
behind his flawed analysis of a classical empirical data set, namely the karate
club graph of Zachary. Our goal here is twofold. Firstly, we present the notion
of balance in terms which are logically consistent, but also consistent with
the way sociologists use the term. The main message is that the notion can only
be meaningfully applied to undirected graphs. Secondly, we correct the analysis
of triads in the karate club graph. This results in the interesting observation
that the graph is, in a precise sense, quite ""unbalanced"". We show that this
lack of balance is characteristic of a wide class of starlike-graphs, and
discuss possible sociological interpretations of this fact, which may be useful
in many other situations.

Specifically we study ${U(1)}_R$ breaking effects parametrized by the gravitino

have neutrino Yukawa couplings with the $R$-charged Higgs field, which develops
a tiny vacuum expectation value after the inclusion of $U(1)_R$ symmetry
breaking. Even with O(1) Yukawa couplings, a suitable size of Dirac neutrino
masses can be generated if the gravitino mass is very small,
$m_{3/2}=1\hbox{---}10\,\mathrm{eV}$. Our flipped $R$-charge assignment also
allows a new type of dimension five operator that can induce the proton decay.
It turns out that the proton stability mildly constrains the allowed range of
the gravitino mass: Gravitino heavier than $10 \ \mathrm{keV}$ can evade the
proton decay constraint as well as cosmological ones. In this case, the largest
neutrino Yukawa coupling is comparable to the electron Yukawa. We also
calculate the mass of the pseudo goldsino and its mixing to neutralinos, and
briefly discuss its implications in cosmology and Higgs phenomenology.

dislocation in an elastic crystalline solid. A symmetric Landau potential of
sixth-order is employed. Dislocation field and elasticity modify the
second-order and fourth-order coefficients of the Landau polynomial,
respectively, where the former makes the coefficient singular at the origin.
The TDGL equation is solved numerically using a finite volume method, where a
wide range of parameter sets is explored. Computations are made for
temperatures both above and below the transition temperature of a defect-free
crystal Tc0. In both cases, the effects of the elastic properties of the solid
and the strength of interaction between the order parameter and the elastic
displacement field are examined. If the system is quenched below Tc0, steady
state is first reached on the compressive side of the dislocation. On the
tensile side, the growth is held back. The effect of thermal noise term in the
TDGL equation is studied. We find that if the dislocation is introduced above
Tc0, thermal noise supports the nucleation of the second phase, and steady
state will be attained earlier than if the thermal noise were absent. For a
dislocation-free solid, we have compared our numerical computations for a
mean-field (spatially averaged) order parameter versus time with the late time

help of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. This last one is regarded as a
Sturm-Liouville problem with the cosmological constant considered as the
associated eigenvalue. The graviton contribution, at one loop is extracted with
the help of a variational approach together with Gaussian trial functionals.
The divergences handled with a zeta function regularization are compared with
the results obtained using a Noncommutative Geometry (NCG) and Modified
Dispersion Relations (MDR). In both NCG and MDR no renormalization scheme is
necessary to remove infinities in contrast to what happens in conventional
approaches. Effects on photon propagation are briefly discussed.

the difference to about 1 GeV. This is relevant for the scheme dependence of
electroweak observables, such as the rho parameter, as well as for the
extraction of the top quark mass from experimental data. In fact, the value
currently extracted by reconstructing the invariant mass of the top quark decay
products is expected to be close to the pole mass, while the analysis of the
total cross section of top quark pair production yields a clean determination
of the MS-bar mass.

bursts, more distant events appear to be systematically harder in the soft
gamma-ray band. Here, we have collected a larger sample of 65 gamma-ray bursts,
whose time integrated spectra are well established and can be well fitted with
the so called Band function. It is confirmed that a correlation between the
redshifts ($z$) and the low-energy indices ($\alpha$) of the Band function does
exist, though it is a bit more scattered than the result of Amati et al. This
correlation can not be simply attributed to the effect of photon reddening.
Furthermore, correlations between $\alpha$ and $E_{\rm peak}$ (the peak energy
in the $\nu F_{\nu}$ spectrum in the rest frame), $\alpha$ and $E_{\rm iso}$
(the isotropic energy release), $\alpha$ and $L_{\rm iso}$ (the isotropic
luminosity) are also found, which indicate that these parameters are somehow
connected. The results may give useful constraints on the physics of gamma-ray
bursts.

mainly investigate the SU(3) gauge theory with N_f degenerate fermions in the
fundamental representation, employing the one-plaquette gauge action and the
Wilson fermion action.
  First we make a brief review of our previous works and thereby clarify the
reason why we conjecture that the conformal window is 7 le N_f le 16.
  Secondly, we introduce a new concept, ""conformal theories with an IR cutoff""
and point out that any numerical simulation on a lattice is bounded by an IR
cutoff Lambda_{IR}. Then we make predictions that when N_f is within the
conformal window, the propagator of a meson G(t) behaves at large t, as G(t) =
c exp(-m_H t)/t^alpha, that is, a modified Yukawa-type decay form, instead of
the usual exponential decay form in the small quark mass region. This holds on
an any lattice for any coupling constant g, as far as g is between 0 and g^*,
where g^* is the IR fixed point. We verify that numerical results really
satisfy the predictions for the N_f=7 case and the N_f=16 case.
  Thirdly, we discuss small number of flavors (N_f=2 sim 6) QCD at finite
temperatures. We point out theoretically and verify numerically that the
correlation functions at T/T_c > 1 exhibit the characteristics of the conformal
function with IR cutoff, an exponential decay with power correction.
  Further, we observe our data are consistent with the picture that the N_f=7
case and the N_f=2 at T sim 2 T_c case are close to the meson unparticle model,
and we estimate gamma^* = 1.2(1). On the other hand, the N_f=16 case and the
N_f=2 at T= 10^2 sim 10^5 Tc cases are close to a free state in the Z(3)
twisted vacuum. The results give clues for long standing issues such as slow
approach of the free energy to the Stefan-Boltzmann ideal gas limit.

the projections along these two vectors as minus the cosinus of the angle
between said vectors; we assume that all vectors are chosen in a fixed plane.
Assuming Classical Microscopic Realism, or CMR, there exist also normalized
projection pairs of the spins of the pairs of particles along some other pair
of vectors. Assuming QM and MR, we also have that the correlations of the
projections along the other vectors as minus the cosinus of the angle between

an event on another event when said events are spatially separated, beside QM
and MR, the theory of Bell lets one deduce various violations of some
inequalities at some choices of quadruplets of the vectors that have been
chosen. Our main result is the existence of quadruplets where at least one of
the said inequalities is violated if one only assumes QM, MR and some very mild
further hypotheses. These weak hypotheses only concern the behavior of
correlations that we use near special quadruplets. We thus get versions of
Bell's theorem that are strictly stronger than the original one and in

the data is accurately known. Assuming that cosmological large-scale structure
power spectra data are multivariate Gaussian-distributed, we show the accuracy
of parameter estimation is limited by the accuracy of the inverse data
covariance matrix - the precision matrix. If the data covariance and precision
matrices are estimated by sampling independent realisations of the data, their
statistical properties are described by the Wishart and Inverse-Wishart
distributions, respectively. Independent of any details of the survey, we show
that the fractional error on a parameter variance, or a Figure-of-Merit, is
equal to the fractional variance of the precision matrix. In addition, for the
only unbiased estimator of the precision matrix, we find that the fractional
accuracy of the parameter error depends only on the difference between the
number of independent realisations and the number of data points, and so can
easily diverge. For a 5% error on a parameter error and N_D << 100 data-points,
a minimum of 200 realisations of the survey are needed, with 10% accuracy for
the data covariance. If the number of data-points N_D >>100 we need N_S > N_D
realisations and a fractional accuracy of <sqrt[2/N_D] in the data covariance.
As the number of power spectra data points grows to N_D>10^4 -10^6 this
approach will be problematic. We discuss possible ways to relax these
conditions: improved theoretical modelling; shrinkage methods;
data-compression; simulation and data resampling methods.

radio emission present the steepest radio spectra and the largest magnetic

towards very low, or undetectable, radio linear polarisation levels. These
properties could be attributed to caustic radio emission produced at a range of
different altitudes in the magnetosphere. We note that most of these

zero-temperature via the Real Space Renormalization introduced in our previous

the equilibrium time $t_{eq}(L)$ as a function of the system size $L$. For
$\sigma<1$ where the static critical temperature for the ferromagnetic
transition is finite $T_c>0$, we obtain that dynamical barriers grow as the
power-law: $\ln t_{eq}(L) \simeq \beta (\frac{4 J_0}{3(2^{1-\sigma}-1)})
L^{1-\sigma}$. For $\sigma=1$ where the static critical temperature vanishes
$T_c=0$, we obtain that dynamical barriers grow logarithmically as : $\ln

finite contributions to the dynamical barriers that can depend on the choice of

when a single photon in a nonlinear cavity blocks the transmission of a second
photon. This effect can occur in Kerr-type systems driven by a laser due to
strong nonlinear photon-photon interactions. We predict the occurrence of
higher-order photon blockades where the transmission of more than two photons
is effectively blocked by single- and two-photon states. This photon blockade
can be achieved by tuning the frequency of the laser driving field to be equal
to the sum of the Kerr nonlinearity and the cavity resonance frequency. We
refer to this phenomenon as two-photon blockade or two-photon state truncation
via nonlinear scissors, and can also be interpreted as photon-induced
tunneling. We also show that, for a driving-field frequency fulfilling another
resonance condition and for higher strengths of the driving field, even a
three-photon blockade can occur but less clearly than in the case of single-
and two-photon blockades. We demonstrate how various photon blockades can be
identified by analyzing photon-number correlations, coherence and entropic
properties, Wigner functions, and spectra of squeezing. We show that two- and
three-photon blockades can, in principle, be observed in various cavity and
circuit quantum electrodynamical systems for which the standard single-photon
blockade was observed without the need of using higher-order driving
interactions or Kerr media exhibiting higher-order nonlinear susceptibility.

order statistics over sliding windows. Given an input of length 2n-1, the task
is to output the function of each window of length n, giving n outputs in
total. Computations over sliding windows are related to direct sum problems
except that inputs to instances almost completely overlap.
  We show an average case and randomized time-space tradeoff lower bound of TS
in Omega(n^2) for multi-way branching programs, and hence standard RAM and
word-RAM models, to compute the number of distinct elements, F_0, in sliding
windows over alphabet [n]. The same lower bound holds for computing the
low-order bit of F_0 and computing any frequency moment F_k for k not equal to
1. We complement this lower bound with a TS in \tilde O(n^2) deterministic RAM
algorithm for exactly computing F_k in sliding windows.
  We show time-space separations between the complexity of sliding-window
element distinctness and that of sliding-window $F_0\bmod 2$ computation. In
particular for alphabet [n] there is a very simple errorless sliding-window
algorithm for element distinctness that runs in O(n) time on average and uses
O(log{n}) space.
  We show that any algorithm for a single element distinctness instance can be
extended to an algorithm for the sliding-window version of element distinctness
with at most a polylogarithmic increase in the time-space product.
  Finally, we show that the sliding-window computation of order statistics such
as the maximum and minimum can be computed with only a logarithmic increase in
time, but that a TS in Omega(n^2) lower bound holds for sliding-window
computation of order statistics such as the median, a nearly linear increase in
time when space is small.

$18.93\pm0.02{\rm(random)}\pm0.10{\rm(systematic)}$ mag (SMC). These estimates

based on families of non-relativistic and covariant Energy Density Functionals

properties of the corresponding nuclear matter equations of state. The
macroscopic approach yields an explicit dependence of the nuclear symmetry
energy at some subsaturation density, for instance S(\rho=0.1 fm^{-3}), or the
neutron skin thickness \Delta r_{np} of a heavy nucleus, on the excitation
energies of isoscalar and isovector GQRs. Using available data it is found that

this correlation together with the experimental values for the isoscalar and

most likely formation channels are highly endothermic. Using data from
Herschel, we study the formation of CH+ and SH+ in a typical high
UV-illumination photon-dominated region (PDR), the Orion Bar. Herschel/HIFI
provides velocity-resolved data of CH+ 1-0 and 2-1 and three hyperfine
transitions of SH+. Herschel/PACS provides information on the excitation and
spatial distribution of CH+ (up to J=6-5). The widths of the CH+ 2-1 and 1-0
transitions are of ~5 km/s, significantly broader than the typical width of
dense gas tracers in the Orion Bar (2-3 km/s) and are comparable to the width
of tracers of the interclump medium such as C+ and HF. The detected SH+
transitions are narrower compared to CH+ and have line widths of 3 km/s,
indicating that SH+ emission mainly originates in denser condensations. Non-LTE
radiative transfer models show that electron collisions affect the excitation
of CH+ and SH+, and that reactive collisions need to be taken into account to
calculate the excitation of CH+. Comparison to PDR models shows that CH+ and
SH+ are tracers of the warm surface region (AV<1.5) of the PDR with
temperatures between 500-1000 K. We have also detected the 5-4 transition of
CF+ (FWHM=1.9 km/s) with an intensity that is consistent with previous
observations of lower-J CF+ transitions toward the Orion Bar. A comparison to
PDR models indicate that the internal vibrational energy of H2 can explain the
formation of CH+ for typical physical conditions in the Orion Bar near the
ionization front. H2 vibrational excitation is the most likely explanation of
SH+ formation as well. The abundance ratios of CH+ and SH+ trace the
destruction paths of these ions, and through that, indirectly, the ratios of H,
H2 and electron abundances as a function of depth into the cloud.

These chiral amplification mechanisms proceed through racemic
{\beta}-sheet-controlled polymerization operative in both surface crystallites
as well as in solution. We develop two complementary theoretical models for
these template-induced desymmetrization processes leading to multicomponent
homochiral copolymers. First, assuming reversible {\beta}-sheet formation, the
equilibrium between the free monomer pool and the polymer strand within the
template is assumed. This yields coupled nonlinear mass balance equations whose
solutions are used to calculate enantiomeric excesses and average lengths of
the homochiral chains formed. The second approach is a probabilistic treatment
based on random polymerization. The occlusion probabilities depend on the
polymerization activation energies for each monomer species and are
proportional to the concentrations of the monomers in solution in the constant
pool approximation. The monomer occlusion probabilities are represented
geometrically in terms of unit simplexes from which conditions for maximizing
or minimizing the likelihood for mirror symmetry breaking can be determined.

  A symmetric random sparse matrix in this paper can be regarded as an
adjacency matrix for a network. We show that if a network is constructed by
nodes that have two different types of degrees then the distribution of its
eigenvector has fat tails such as the stable distribution ($\alpha < 2 $) under
a certain condition; whereas if a network is constructed with nodes that have
only one type of degree, the distribution of its first eigenvector becomes the
Gaussian approximately. The cavity method is used to clarify these results.

the sites of rapid heating and plasma upflow during the rise phase of flares.
An example is presented from a M1.1 class flare observed on 2011 February 16
07:44 UT for which the location of the upflow region seen by EIS can be
precisely aligned to high spatial resolution images obtained by the Atmospheric
Imaging Assembly (AIA) and Heliospheric Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). A string of bright flare kernels is found to
be aligned with a ridge of strong magnetic field, and one kernel site is
highlighted for which an upflow speed of 400 km/s is measured in lines formed
at 10-30 MK. The line-of-sight magnetic field strength at this location is 1000
G. Emission over a continuous range of temperatures down to the chromosphere is
found, and the kernels have a similar morphology at all temperatures and are
spatially coincident with sizes at the resolution limit of the AIA instrument
(< 400 km). For temperatures of 0.3-3.0 MK the EIS emission lines show multiple
velocity components, with the dominant component becoming more blue-shifted
with temperature from a redshift of 35 km/s at 0.3 MK to a blueshift of 60 km/s
at 3.0 MK. Emission lines from 1.5-3.0 MK show a weak redshifted component at
around 60-70 km/s implying multi-directional flows at the kernel site.
Significant non-thermal broadening corresponding to velocities of 120 km/s is
found at 10-30MK, and the electron density in the kernel, measured at 2 MK, is
3.4 x 10^10 cm-3. Finally, the Fe XXIV 192.03/255.11 ratio suggests that the
EIS calibration has changed since launch, with the long wavelength channel less
sensitive than the short wavelength channel by around a factor two.

theory follows from an underlying supergravity, the mediation of supersymmetry
breaking to the dark sector induces a soft mass for the scalar of order the
gravitino mass. This is enough to forbid the construction of supersymmetric
symmetrons and ensures that when other screening mechanisms operate, no object
in the universe is unscreened thereby precluding any observable signatures. In
view of a possible origin of modifed gravity within fundamental physics, we
find that no-scale models are the only ones that can circumvent these features.

biomedical applications of sodium MRI in vivo. Sodium MRI is a subject of
increasing interest in translational research as it can give some direct and
quantitative biochemical information on the tissue viability, cell integrity
and function, and therefore not only help the diagnosis but also the prognosis
of diseases and treatment outcomes. It has already been applied in vivo in most
of human tissues, such as brain for stroke or tumor detection and therapeutic
response, in breast cancer, in articular cartilage, in muscle and in kidney,
and it was shown in some studies that it could provide very useful new
information not available through standard proton MRI. However, this technique
is still very challenging due to the low detectable sodium signal in biological
tissue with MRI and hardware/software limitations of the clinical scanners. The
article is divided in three parts: (1) the role of sodium in biological
tissues, (2) a short review on sodium magnetic resonance, and (3) a review of
some studies on sodium MRI on different organs/diseases to date.

opportunistic relaying (OR), is applied within a mobile wireless body area
network (WBAN). Its effectiveness in interference mitigation is investigated in
a scenario where there are multiple closely-located networks. Due to a typical
WBAN's nature, no coordination is used among different WBANs. A suitable
time-division-multiple-access (TDMA) is adopted as both an intra-network and
also an inter-network access scheme. Extensive on-body and off-body channel
gain measurements are employed to gauge performance, which are overlaid to
simulate a realistic WBAN working environment. It is found that opportunistic
relaying is able to improve the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR)
threshold value at outage probability of 10% by an average of 5 dB, and it is
also shown that it can reduce level crossing rate (LCR) significantly at a low
SINR threshold value. Furthermore, this scheme is more efficient when on-body
channels fade less slowly.

nonlinearities are represented by the crystal growth rate. This paper addresses
the development of the crystal growth rate model according to two approaches.
The first approach is classical and consists of determining the parameters of

that combines an artificial neural network (ANN) as an approximator of the
growth rate with prior knowledge represented by the mass balance of sucrose

simplified and empirical models. Nevertheless, each of these categories of
models are not convenient for every application. Indeed, the numerical model
requires high calculation time; conditions of use of the simplified models are
limited, and experimental models need not only important financial resources
but also a perfect control of experimental devices (e.g. scale model), as well
as climatic characteristics of the location (e.g. in situ experiment). In this
article, a new model based on a combination of multiple simplified models is
established. The objective is to improve this category of model. The
originality of our paper relies on the coupling of several simplified models of
indoor daylighting calculations. The accuracy of the simulation code,
introduced into CODYRUN software to simulate correctly indoor illuminance, is
then verified. Besides, the software consists of a numerical building
simulation code, developed in the Physics and Mathematical Engineering
Laboratory for Energy and Environment (P.I.M.E.N.T) at the University of
Reunion. Initially dedicated to the thermal, airflow and hydrous phenomena in
the buildings, the software has been completed for the calculation of indoor
daylighting. New models and algorithms - which rely on a semi-detailed approach
- will be presented in this paper. In order to validate the accuracy of the
integrated models, many test cases have been considered as analytical,
inter-software comparisons and experimental comparisons. In order to prove the
accuracy of the new model - which can properly simulate the illuminance - a
confrontation between the results obtained from the software (developed in this
research paper) and the major made at a given place is described in details. A
new statistical indicator to appreciate the margins of errors - named RSD

optimization of the building. For the first step, tools such as nodal or zonal
models have been largely implemented. For the second step, the assessment of
air velocities, in three dimensions and in a large space, can only be performed
through the use of detailed models such as with CFD. This paper deals with the
improvement of thermal comfort by ventilating around the occupants. For this
purpose, the average velocity coefficient definition is modified to be adapted
to CFD and the areas involving movement or the living spaces. We propose a new
approach based on the derivation of a new quantity: the well-ventilated
percentage of a living space. The well-ventilated percentage of a space allows
a time analysis of the aeraulic behaviour of the building in its environment.
These percentages can be over a period such as one day, a season or a year.

house according to their uses, the environment, the architectural choices and
the constraints related to the design of bioclimatic buildings.
