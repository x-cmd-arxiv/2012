observation times are a scarce resource. The agent, limited to making a finite
number of discrete observations, must adaptively decide his observation
strategy to minimize detection delay and the probability of false alarm. Under
two different models of observation rights, we establish the existence of
optimal strategies, and formulate an algorithmic approach to the problem via
jump operators. We describe algorithms for these problems, and illustrate them
with some numerical results. As the number of observation rights tends to
infinity, we also show convergence to the classical continuous observation
problem of Shiryaev.

modified matter models, modified gravity models and the inhomogeneous model.
The cosmological constant suffers from two major problems: one regarding
fine-tuning and the other regarding coincidence. To solve them there arose
modified matter models such as quintessence, k-essence, coupled dark energy,
and unified dark energy. We compare those models by presenting attractive
aspects, new rising problems and possible solutions. Furthermore we review
modified gravity models that lead to late-time accelerated expansion without
invoking a new form of dark energy; they contain f(R) gravity and the
Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati model. We also discuss observational constraints on
those models and on future modified gravity theories. Finally we review the
inhomogeneous Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi model that drops an assumption of the
spatial homogeneity of the Universe. We also present basics of cosmology and
scalar field theory, which are useful especially for students and novices to

of the pulsar spin-down power at 1.4 kpc. The energetics, co-location with the
SNR, and the relatively small extent of the TeV emission strongly argue for the
PWN origin of the TeV photons. We consider the origin of the TeV emission in
CTA 1.

physical properties described by ""many-body physics,"" including
high-temperature superconductivity and heavy fermion behavior. Here, using
high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction and time-of-flight neutron
scattering, we show that the isostructural mixed valence compound,
KNi$_2$S$_2$, displays a number of highly unusual structural transitions, most
notably the presence of charge density wave fluctuations that disappear on
cooling. This behavior occurs without magnetic or charge order, in contrast to
expectations based on all other known materials. Furthermore, the
low-temperature electronic state of KNi$_2$S$_2$ is found to exhibit many
characteristics of heavy-fermion behavior, including a heavy electron state
($m^*/m_e \sim$ 24), with a negative coefficient of thermal expansion, and
superconductivity below $T_c$ = 0.46(2) K. In the potassium nickel sulfide,
these behaviors arise in the absence of localized magnetism, and instead appear
to originate in proximity to charge order.

the well-studied abstract Tile Assembly Model (aTAM) by permitting tiles of
shapes beyond unit squares. Our main result shows the surprising fact that any
aTAM system, consisting of many different tile types, can be simulated by a
single tile type of a general shape. As a consequence, we obtain a single
universal tile type of a single (constant-size) shape that serves as a
""universal tile machine"": the single universal tile type can simulate any
desired aTAM system when given a single seed assembly that encodes the desired
aTAM system. We also show how to adapt this result to convert any of a variety
of plane tiling systems (such as Wang tiles) into a ""nearly"" plane tiling
system with a single tile (but with small gaps between the tiles). All of these
results rely on the ability to both rotate and translate tiles; by contrast, we
show that a single nonrotatable tile, of arbitrary shape, can produce
assemblies which either grow infinitely or cannot grow at all, implying
drastically limited computational power.
  On the positive side, we show how to simulate arbitrary cellular automata for
a limited number of steps using a single nonrotatable tile and a linear-size
seed assembly.

COBE missions, with the aim of estimating the relative contributions of
asteroidal, cometary and interstellar dust to the zodiacal cloud. Our most
important result is the detection of an isotropic component of foreground
radiation due to interstellar dust.
  The dust in the inner solar system is known to have a fan-like distribution.
If this is assumed to extend to the orbit of Mars, we find that cometary,
asteroidal and interstellar dust account for 70%, 22% and 7.5% of the dust in
the fan. We find a worse fit if the fan is assumed to extend to the orbit of
Jupiter. Our model is broadly consistent with the analysis by Divine (1993) of
interplanetary dust detected by Ulysses and other spacecraft. Our estimate of
the mass-density of interstellar dust in the inner solar system is consistent
with estimates from Ulysses at 1.5 au, but is an order of magnitude higher than
Ulysses estimates at r > 4 au. Only 1% of the zodiacal dust arriving at the
earth would be interstellar, in our model.
  Our models can be further tested by ground-based kinematical studies of the
zodiacal cloud, which need to extend over a period of years to monitor solar
cycle variations in interstellar dust, by dynamical simulations, and by in situ
measurements from spacecraft.

which the quantity of interest is a posterior distribution of state and/or
parameters given some uncertain observations. For the common case in which the
forward operator is smoothing, then the inverse problem is ill-posed.
Well-posedness is imposed via regularisation in the form of a prior, which is
often Gaussian. Under quite general conditions, it can be shown that the
posterior is absolutely continuous with respect to the prior and it may be
well-defined on function space in terms of its density with respect to the
prior. In this case, by constructing a proposal for which the prior is
invariant, one can define Metropolis-Hastings schemes for MCMC which are
well-defined on function space, and hence do not degenerate as the dimension of
the underlying quantity of interest increases to infinity, e.g. under mesh
refinement when approximating PDE in finite dimensions. However, in practice,
despite the attractive theoretical properties of the currently available
schemes, they may still suffer from long correlation times, particularly if the
data is very informative about some of the unknown parameters. In fact, in this
case it may be the directions of the posterior which coincide with the (already
known) prior which decorrelate the slowest. The information incorporated into
the posterior through the data is often contained within some
finite-dimensional subspace, in an appropriate basis, perhaps even one defined
by eigenfunctions of the prior. We aim to exploit this fact and improve the
mixing time of function-space MCMC by careful rescaling of the proposal. To
this end, we introduce two new basic methods of increasing complexity,

susceptibility in the presence of a weak external magnetic field. Remarkably,
the spin-wave interaction only manifests itself beyond two-loop order. In
particular, there is no term of order $T^2$ in the low-temperature series of
the free energy density. This is the analog of Dyson's statement that, in the

set of candidate roles and use a greedy selection strategy to iteratively pick
a small subset such that the differences between the resulting RBAC

advocate an alternative approach that recasts role mining as an inference

algorithms to minimize the number of roles needed to represent the
access-control matrix, we derive probabilistic models to learn the RBAC
configuration that most likely underlies the given matrix.
  Our models are generative in that they reflect the way that permissions are
assigned to users in a given RBAC configuration. We additionally model how
user-permission assignments that conflict with an RBAC configuration emerge and
we investigate the influence of constraints on role hierarchies and on the
number of assignments. In experiments with access-control matrices from

to trigger a maximized spread of influence, is crucial to viral marketing on
social networks. For practical viral marketing on large scale social networks,
it is required that influence maximization algorithms should have both
guaranteed accuracy and high scalability. However, existing algorithms suffer a
scalability-accuracy dilemma: conventional greedy algorithms guarantee the
accuracy with expensive computation, while the scalable heuristic algorithms
suffer from unstable accuracy.
  In this paper, we focus on solving this scalability-accuracy dilemma. We
point out that the essential reason of the dilemma is the surprising fact that
the submodularity, a key requirement of the objective function for a greedy
algorithm to approximate the optimum, is not guaranteed in all conventional
greedy algorithms in the literature of influence maximization. Therefore a
greedy algorithm has to afford a huge number of Monte Carlo simulations to
reduce the pain caused by unguaranteed submodularity. Motivated by this
critical finding, we propose a static greedy algorithm, named StaticGreedy, to
strictly guarantee the submodularity of influence spread function during the
seed selection process. The proposed algorithm makes the computational expense
dramatically reduced by two orders of magnitude without loss of accuracy.
Moreover, we propose a dynamical update strategy which can speed up the
StaticGreedy algorithm by 2-7 times on large scale social networks.

quantized energy spectrum consisting of discrete Bloch bands. In two
dimensions, electrons moving through a magnetic field also develop a quantized
energy spectrum, consisting of highly degenerate Landau energy levels. In 1976
Douglas Hofstadter theoretically considered the intersection of these two
problems and discovered that 2D electrons subjected to both a magnetic field
and a periodic electrostatic potential exhibit a self-similar recursive energy
spectrum. Known as Hofstadter's butterfly, this complex spectrum results from a
delicate interplay between the characteristic lengths associated with the two
quantizing fields, and represents one of the first quantum fractals discovered
in physics. In the decades since, experimental attempts to study this effect
have been limited by difficulties in reconciling the two length scales. Typical
crystalline systems (<1 nm periodicity) require impossibly large magnetic
fields to reach the commensurability condition, while in artificially
engineered structures (>100 nm), the corresponding fields are too small to
completely overcome disorder. Here we demonstrate that moire superlattices
arising in bilayer graphene coupled to hexagonal boron nitride provide a nearly
ideal-sized periodic modulation, enabling unprecedented experimental access to
the fractal spectrum. We confirm that quantum Hall effect features associated
with the fractal gaps are described by two integer topological quantum numbers,
and report evidence of their recursive structure. Observation of Hofstadter's
spectrum in graphene provides the further opportunity to investigate emergent
behaviour within a fractal energy landscape in a system with tunable internal
degrees of freedom.

relatively narrow range of tissues or cell types. However, understanding the
biology of organismal phenotypes will involve understanding regulation in
multiple tissues, and ongoing studies are collecting eQTL data in dozens of
cell types. Here we present a statistical framework for powerfully detecting
eQTLs in multiple tissues or cell types (or, more generally, multiple
subgroups). The framework explicitly models the potential for each eQTL to be
active in some tissues and inactive in others. By modeling the sharing of
active eQTLs among tissues this framework increases power to detect eQTLs that
are present in more than one tissue compared with ""tissue-by-tissue"" analyses
that examine each tissue separately. Conversely, by modeling the inactivity of
eQTLs in some tissues, the framework allows the proportion of eQTLs shared
across different tissues to be formally estimated as parameters of a model,
addressing the difficulties of accounting for incomplete power when comparing
overlaps of eQTLs identified by tissue-by-tissue analyses. Applying our
framework to re-analyze data from transformed B cells, T cells and fibroblasts
we find that it substantially increases power compared with tissue-by-tissue
analysis, identifying 63% more genes with eQTLs (at FDR=0.05). Further the
results suggest that, in contrast to previous analyses of the same data, the

the dual space matrix ordered as well. The purpose of these notes is to give a
condition that describes when the linear map taking a basis of the n by n
matrices to its dual basis is a complete order isomorphism and complete
co-order isomorphism. In the case of the standard matrix units this map is a
complete order isomorphism and this is a restatement of the correspondence
between completely positive maps and the Choi matrix. However, we exhibit
natural orthonormal bases for the matrices such that this map is an order
isomorphism, but not a complete order isomorphism. Some bases yield complete
co-order isomorphisms. Included among such bases is the Pauli basis and tensor
products of the Pauli basis. Consequently, when the Pauli basis is used in
place of the the matrix unit basis, the analogue of Choi's theorem is a
characterization of completely co-positive maps.

For free edges, the situation changes as thermal excitations are gapless. The

understanding the quantum classical boundary, such states have been suggested
as offering a quantum advantage for quantum metrology, quantum communication

difficulty that the irreversible interaction with an environment causes the
superposition to rapidly evolve to a mixture of the component states in the
case that the environment is not monitored. Here we show that by engineering
the interaction with the environment there exists a large class of systems that
can evolve irreversibly to a cat state. To be precise we show that it is

To appear at SPAA'13",,,,"cs.GT cs.DS math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the dynamic behavior of several variants of the Network Creation
Game, introduced by Fabrikant et al. [PODC'03]. Equilibrium networks in these
models have desirable properties like low social cost and small diameter, which
makes them attractive for the decentralized creation of overlay-networks.
Unfortunately, due to the non-constructiveness of the Nash equilibrium, no
distributed algorithm for finding such networks is known. We treat these games
as sequential-move games and analyze whether (uncoordinated) selfish play
eventually converges to an equilibrium state. Thus, we shed light on one of the
most natural algorithms for this problem: distributed local search, where in
each step some agent performs a myopic selfish improving move.
  We show that fast convergence is guaranteed for all versions of Swap Games,
introduced by Alon et al. [SPAA'10], if the initial network is a tree, and show
that this process can be sped up to an almost optimal number of moves. For
non-tree networks we show the surprising result that even one non-tree edge
suffices to destroy the convergence guarantee and no move policy can enforce
convergence. This answers an open problem from Ehsani et al. [SPAA'11] in the
negative. We extend our negative results to the well-studied original version
and prove that there is no convergence guarantee -- even if all agents play
optimally. Furthermore, we show the quite surprising result that employing
cost-sharing yields even worse dynamic behavior.
  Finally, we contrast our mostly negative theoretical results by a careful
empirical study. Our simulations indicate two positive facts: (1) The
non-convergent behavior seems to be confined to a small set of pathological
instances and is unlikely to show up in practice. (2) In all our simulations we
observed a remarkably fast convergence towards a stable network in O(n) steps,
where n is the number of agents.

Interestingly enough, the pulsar timing solution yields an estimated companion
mass 0.93 M_{\odot}<M_C<1.5 M_{\odot}, compatible with that of a neutron star.
As such, it is possible that PSR J1811-1736 is a double neutron star (DNS)
system, one of the very few discovered so far. This scenario can be
investigated through deep optical/infrared (IR) observations. We used J, H,
K-band images, obtained as part of the UK Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Infrared
Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), and available in the recent Data Release 9 Plus, to
search for its undetected companion of the PSR J1811-1736 binary pulsar. We
detected a possible companion star to PSR J1811-1736 within the 3 sigma radio
position uncertainty (1.32 arcsec), with magnitudes J=18.61+/-0.07,
H=16.65+/-0.03, and K=15.46+/-0.02. The star colours are consistent with either
a main sequence (MS) star close to the turn-off or a lower red giant branch
(RGB) star, at a pulsar distance of ~5.5 kpc and with a reddening of
E(B-V)~4.9. The star mass and radius would be compatible with the constraints
on the masses and orbital inclination of the binary system inferred from the
mass function and the lack of radio eclipses near superior conjunction. Thus,
it is possible that it is the companion to PSR J1811-1736. However, based on
the star density in the field, we estimated a quite large chance coincidence
probability of ~0.27 between the pulsar and the star, which makes the
association unlikely. No other star is detected within the 3 sigma pulsar radio
position down to J~20.5, H~19.4$ and K~18.6, which would allow us to rule out a
MS companion star earlier than a mid-to-late M spectral type.

in radiatively generating neutrino masses. The symmetry that stabilizes the
dark matter also suppresses neutrino masses to appear first at three-loop
level. Without the need of right-handed neutrinos or other very heavy new
fields, this offers an attractive explanation of the hierarchy between the
electroweak and neutrino mass scales. The model has distinct verifiable
predictions for the neutrino masses, flavor mixing angles, colliders and dark

have barely escaped detection at LEP and could be observable at LHC as a peak

consistent with WMAP constraints due to coannihilation with the lightest stau,

star and the formation of an accretion disk and/or the ejection of unbound
material are prime candidates for the joint detection of gravitational-wave and
electromagnetic signals when the next generation of gravitational-wave
detectors comes online. However, the disruption of the neutron star and the
properties of the post-merger remnant are very sensitive to the parameters of
the binary. In this paper, we study the impact of the radius of the neutron
star and the alignment of the black hole spin for systems within the range of
mass ratio currently deemed most likely for field binaries (M_BH ~ 7 M_NS) and
for black hole spins large enough for the neutron star to disrupt (J/M^2=0.9).
We find that: (i) In this regime, the merger is particularly sensitive to the
radius of the neutron star, with remnant masses varying from 0.3M_NS to 0.1M_NS
for changes of only 2 km in the NS radius; (ii) 0.01-0.05M_sun of unbound
material can be ejected with kinetic energy >10^51 ergs, a significant increase
compared to low mass ratio, low spin binaries. This ejecta could power
detectable optical and radio afterglows. (iii) Only a small fraction (<3%) of
the Advanced LIGO events in this parameter range have gravitational-wave
signals which could offer constraints on the equation of state of the neutron
star. (iv) A misaligned black hole spin works against disk formation, with less
neutron star material remaining outside of the black hole after merger, and a
larger fraction of that material remaining in the tidal tail instead of the
forming accretion disk. (v) Large kicks (v>300 km/s) can be given to the final
black hole as a result of a precessing BHNS merger, when the disruption of the

find 21 NEAs whose orbital fits show a measurable orbital drift with a signal

becoming stronger detections in the future. In some cases it is possible to
constrain physical quantities otherwise unknown by means of the detected

shows an excess of retrograde rotators that can be connected to the delivery

the distribution for NEAs obliquity. We discuss the implications of the

global AdS4 in vacuum Einstein-Hilbert gravity with negative cosmological
constant. These are non-compactly-generated black holes in which a single
connected bulk horizon extends to meet the conformal boundary. Thus the induced
(conformal) boundary metric has smooth horizons as well. In our examples, the
boundary spacetime contains a pair of black holes connected through the bulk by
a tubular bulk horizon. Taking one boundary black hole to be hotter than the
other ($\Delta T \neq 0$) prohibits equilibrium. The result is a so-called
flowing funnel, a stationary bulk black hole with a non-Killing horizon that
may be said to transport heat toward the cooler boundary black hole. While
generators of the bulk future horizon evolve toward zero expansion in the far
future, they begin at finite affine parameter with infinite expansion on a
singular past horizon characterized by power-law divergences with universal
exponents. We explore both the horizon generators and the boundary stress
tensor in detail. While most of our results are numerical, a semi-analytic
fluid/gravity description can be obtained by passing to a one-parameter
generalization of the above boundary conditions. The new parameter detunes the
temperatures $T_{bulk BH}$ and $T_{bndy BH}$ of the bulk and boundary black
holes, and we may then take \alpha = $T_\mathrm{bndy BH}/T_\mathrm{bulk BH}$
and \Delta T small to control the accuracy of the fluid-gravity approximation.
In the small \alpha, \Delta T regime we find excellent agreement with our
numerical solutions. For our cases the agreement also remains quite good even
for $\alpha \sim 0.8$. In terms of a dual CFT, our \alpha = 1 solutions
describe heat transport via a large N version of Hawking radiation through a
deconfined plasma that couples efficiently to both boundary black holes.

shows that, most probably, they are now beyond the LHC reach . This negative
chances increase further (at more than 95% c.l.) if one includes dark matter
constraints in the analysis, in particular the last XENON100 data. However, the
models would be probed completely by XENON1T. The mass of the LSP neutralino
gets essentially fixed around 1 TeV. We do not incorporate ad hoc measures of
the fine-tuning to penalize unnatural possibilities: such penalization arises
automatically from the careful Bayesian analysis itself, and allows to scan the
whole parameter space. In this way, we can explain and resolve the apparent
discrepancies between the previous results in the literature. Although SUSY has
become hard to detect at LHC, this does not necessarily mean that is very
fine-tuned. We use Bayesian techniques to show the experimental Higgs mass is
at $\sim 2\ \sigma$ off the CMSSM or NUHM expectation. This is substantial but
not dramatic. Although the CMSSM or the NUHM are unlikely to show up at the
LHC, they are still interesting and plausible models after the Higgs
observation; and, if they are true, the chances of discovering them in future
dark matter experiments are quite high.

the presence of a quantum dot inside the Hall bar with well controlled electron

studies can help reveal the nature of the fractional quantum Hall liquid. In
our first example we study the \nu=1/3 and \nu=2/3 liquids in the presence of a
\nu=1 quantum dot. When the quantum dot becomes large, its edge states join
those of the Hall bar to reconstruct the edge states configuration. Taking
randomness around the edges into account, we find that in the
disorder-irrelevant phase the two-terminal conductance of the original \nu=1/3
system vanishes at zero temperature, while that of the \nu=2/3 case remains
finite. This distinction is rooted in the fact that the \nu=2/3 state is built
upon the \nu=1 state. In the disorder-dominated phase, the two-terminal
conductance of \nu=1/3 system is (1/5)\frac{e^2}{h} and that of \nu=2/3 system
is (1/2)\frac{e^2}{h}. We further apply the same idea to the \nu=5/2 system
which realizes either the Pfaffian or the anti-Pfaffian states. In this case we
study the edge transport in the presence of a central \nu=3 quantum dot. If the
quantum dot is large enough for its edge states joining those of the Hall bar,
in the disorder-irrelevant phase the total two-terminal conductance in the
Pfaffian case is G^{Pf}_{tot}\rightarrow 2 \frac{e^2}{h} while that of
anti-Pfaffian case is higher but not universal, G^{aPf}_{tot}> 2 \frac{e^2}{h}.
This difference can be used to determine which one of these two states is
realized at \nu=5/2. In the disorder-dominated phase, however, the total
two-terminal conductances in these two systems are exactly the same,
G^{Pf/aPf}_{tot}=(7/3)\frac{e^2}{h}.

the Ninth Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release (DR9). From the total
set of galaxies, a magnitude-limited sample of galaxies with redshifts in the
range 0 < z < 0.15 was created. The sample covers the largest completely
connected area of the celestial sphere within the catalogue, with limits in
right ascension from 120 to 240 degrees and declination from 0 to 60 degrees,
which is a region that includes the largest galactic samples that have been
studied from the fractal viewpoint to date. The sample contains 164,168
galaxies.
  Using the sliding-window technique, the multifractal dimension spectrum and
its dependence on radial distance are determined. This generalisation of the
concept of fractal dimension is used to analyse large-scale clustering of
matter in complex systems. Likewise, the lacunarity spectrum, which is a
quantity that complements the characterisation of a fractal set by quantifying
how the set fills the space in which it is embedded, is determined.
  Using these statistical tools, we find that the clustering of galaxies
exhibits fractal behaviour that depends on the radial distance for all
calculated quantities. A transition to homogeneity is not observed in the
calculation of the fractal dimension of galaxies; instead, the galaxies exhibit
a multifractal behaviour whose dimensional spectrum does not exceed the
physical spatial dimension for radial distances up to 180 Mpc/h from each
centre within the sample. Our results and their implications are discussed in
the context of the formation of large-scale structures in the Universe.

10^{3} times the solar value. The F(FUV)/F(NUV) flux ratio, a driver for

we normalise the star-formation rate of galaxies at each epoch to the typical

neither is the main driver of the enhanced star-formation rate density at

gas-rich discs or multiple minor mergers the most likely alternatives. However,
we find that 40-50% of starburst galaxies, those with enhanced specific star
formation at their epoch, are major mergers and this fraction is redshift
independent. Finally, we find the surprising result that the typical size of a

decreasing UV luminosity. We find strong evidence of large-scale outflows,
transporting the neutral/ionized gas in the interstellar medium away from the
galaxy. Galaxies exhibiting both interstellar absorption and Lya emission lines
show a significant velocity offset between the two features (200-1140 km/s). We
find tentative evidence that this measure of the outflow velocity increases
with UV luminosity and/or stellar mass. The luminosity- and mass-dependent
outflow strengths suggest that the efficiency of feedback and enrichment of the
surrounding medium depend on these parameters. We present composite spectra of
the absorption-line-only and Lya-emitting subsets of the UV luminous galaxies
at z~3.7. The composite spectra are similar to those of lower-z and
lower-luminosity LBGs samples, but with some subtle differences. Analyses of
the composite spectra suggest that the UV luminous LBGs at z~3.7 may have a
higher covering fraction of absorbing gas, and may be older than their lower-z
and lower-luminosity counterparts. In addition, we have discovered 5 galaxies
that belong to a massive overdensity at z=3.78. Finally, two galaxies each show
two distinct sets of interstellar absorption features. The latter may be a sign
of a final stage of major merger, or clumpy disk formation. Their presence
implies that frequency of such sources among our luminous z~3.7 LBGs may be an
order of magnitude higher than in lower redshift and lower luminosity samples.

We defined a local density parameter and a tidal forces estimator and used a
cluster richness estimator from the literature. The possible correlations
between these parameters were removed using a principal component analysis. We
applied a stratified statistical method that takes into account the effect of
possible confounding factors like the galaxy mass. We found that the prevalence
of optical AGN is a factor 2-3 lower in the densest environments, but increases
by a factor of ~2 in the presence of strong one-on-one interactions. The
importance of galaxy interactions decreases from star-forming nuclei (SFN) to
Seyferts to LINERs to passive galaxies, in accordance with previous suggestions
of an evolutionary time-sequence. The fraction of radio AGN increases strongly
towards denser environments, and is enhanced by galaxy interactions. Overall,
the results agree with a scenario in which the mechanisms of accretion into the
black hole are determined by the presence and nature of a supply of gas, which
in turn is controlled by the local density of galaxies and their interactions.
A plentiful cold gas supply is required to trigger SFN, optical AGN and
radiatively-efficient radio AGN. This is less common in the cold-gas-poor
environments of groups and clusters, but is enhanced by one-on-one interactions
which result in the flow of gas into nuclear regions; these two factors compete
against each other. In the denser environments where cold gas is rare, cooling
hot gas can supply the nucleus at a sufficient rate to fuel low-luminosity
radiatively-inefficient radio AGN. However, the increased prevalence of these
AGN in interacting galaxies suggests that this is not the only mechanism by
which radiatively-inefficient AGN can be triggered.

supernova SN2006aj has puzzled theorists for years. A supernova shock breakout
and a jet from a newborn stellar mass compact object were put forward to
explain its multiwavelength signature. We propose that the source is naturally
explained by another channel, a tidal disruption of a white dwarf (WD) by an
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). The tidal disruption is accompanied by a
tidal pinching, which leads to the ignition of a WD and a supernova. Some
debris falls back onto the IMBH, forms a disk, which quickly amplifies the
magnetic field, and launches a jet. We successfully fit soft X-ray spectrum
with the Comptonized blackbody emission from a jet photosphere. The optical/UV
emission is consistent with self-absorbed synchrotron from the expanding jet
front. The accretion rate temporal dependence Mdot(t) in a tidal disruption
provides a good fit to soft X-ray lightcurve. The IMBH mass is found to be
about 10^4Msun in three independent estimates: (1) fitting tidal disruption

to 328 eV. The observations reveal very rich and complex structures, both in
terms of velocity fields and emission-line ratios. The CL emission is elongated
along the NE-SW direction, with the stronger emission preferentially localized
to the NE of the nucleus. CLs are emitted by gas covering a wide range of
velocities, with maximum blueshifts/redshifts of ~ -1600/1000 km/s. There is a
trend for the gas located on the NE side of the nucleus to be blueshifted while
the gas located towards the SW is redshifted. The morphology and the kinematics
of the near-infrared CLs are in very good agreement with the ones displayed by
low-ionization lines and optical CLs, suggesting a common origin. The line flux
distributions, velocity maps, ionization structure (traced by the

FMR is restricted to only star-forming galaxies and in the Hubble residual
calculation we include only hosts with log(SFR) > -2. Our results strongly
suggest that metallicity is the underlying source of the correlation between
Hubble residuals and host galaxy mass. Since the FMR is nearly constant between
z = 2 and the present, use of the FMR along with light curve width and color
should provide a robust distance measurement method that minimizes systematic

fact. This material is systematically outflowing and shows a large range in
parameters. However, its actual nature and dynamics are still not clear. In
order to gain insights into these important issues we performed a literature
search for papers reporting the parameters of the soft X-ray warm absorbers
(WAs) in 35 type 1 Seyferts and compared their properties to those of the
ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) detected in the same sample. The fraction of sources
with WAs is >60%, consistent with previous studies. The fraction of sources
with UFOs is >34%, >67% of which also show WAs. The large dynamic range
obtained when considering all the absorbers together allows us, for the first
time, to investigate general relations among them. In particular, we find
significant correlations indicating that the closer the absorber is to the
central black hole, the higher the ionization, column, outflow velocity and
consequently the mechanical power. The absorbers continuously populate the
whole parameter space, with the WAs and the UFOs lying always at the two ends
of the distribution. This strongly suggest that these absorbers, often
considered of different types, could actually represent parts of a single
large-scale stratified outflow observed at different locations from the black
hole. The observed parameters and correlations are consistent with both
radiation pressure through Compton scattering and MHD processes contributing to
the outflow acceleration, the latter playing a major role. Most of the
absorbers, especially the UFOs, have a sufficiently high mechanical power to
significantly contribute to AGN feedback.

matter haloes of mass $10^{11}-10^{15}$ $h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$, over a redshift
range $z=0-2$. We compute the halo mass function and show that it is reasonably
well fitted by the Sheth-Tormen formula. More importantly, we focus on the CDM
and neutrino properties of the density and peculiar velocity fields in the
cosmological volume, inside and in the outskirts of virialized haloes. The
dynamical state of the neutrino particles depends strongly on their momentum:
whereas neutrinos in the low velocity tail behave similarly to CDM particles,
neutrinos in the high velocity tail are not affected by the clustering of the
underlying CDM component. We find that the neutrino (linear) unperturbed
momentum distribution is modified and mass and redshift dependent deviations
from the expected Fermi-Dirac distribution are in place both in the
cosmological volume and inside haloes. The neutrino density profiles around
virialized haloes have been carefully investigated and a simple fitting formula
is provided. The neutrino profile, unlike the cold dark matter one, is found to
be cored with core size and central density that depend on the neutrino mass,
redshift and mass of the halo, for halos of masses larger than $\sim
10^{13.5}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. For lower masses the neutrino profile is best
fitted by a simple power-law relation in the range probed by the simulations.
Our findings are particularly important in view of upcoming large-scale
structure surveys, like Euclid, that are expected to probe the non-linear
regime at the percent level with lensing and clustering observations.

matrix after flavor-breaking transforms this operator into the trilinear baryon
number violating operator UDD with flavor coefficients all suppressed by three
powers of Yukawa couplings. There is a limit where this model realizes exact
MFV; we compute corrections away from MFV, show that they are under theoretical

revised based on the analysis of dithered star observations. The calibration
transfer from the HST spectrophotometric standard stars to the multi-epoch
tertiary standard star catalogs in the science fields follows three different
paths: observations of primary standard stars with the SDSS PT telescope;
observations of Landolt secondary standard stars with SNLS MegaCam instrument
at CFHT; and direct observation of faint HST standard stars with MegaCam. In
addition, the tertiary stars for the two surveys are cross-calibrated using
dedicated MegaCam observations of stripe 82. This overlap enables the
comparison of these three calibration paths and justifies using their
combination to improve the calibration accuracy. Flat-field corrections have
improved the uniformity of each survey as demonstrated by the comparison of
photometry in overlapping fields: the rms of the difference between the two
surveys is 3 mmag in gri, 4 mmag in z and 8 mmag in u. We also find a
remarkable agreement (better than 1%) between the SDSS and the SNLS calibration
in griz. The cross-calibration and the introduction of direct calibration
observations bring redundancy and strengthen the confidence in the resulting
calibration. We conclude that the surveys are calibrated to the HST with a
precision of about 0.4% in griz. This precision is comparable to the external
uncertainty affecting the color of the HST primary standard stars.

(RV) precision than the best current spectrographs provide. Recent developments
in astrophotonics (Bland-Hawthorn & Horton 2006, Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2010)
and adaptive optics (AO) enable single mode fiber (SMF) fed, high resolution
spectrographs, which can realize the next step in precision. SMF feeds have
intrinsic advantages over multimode fiber or slit coupled spectrographs: The
intensity distribution at the fiber exit is extremely stable, and as a result
the line spread function of a well-designed spectrograph is fully decoupled
from input coupling conditions, like guiding or seeing variations (Ihle et al.
2010). Modal noise, a limiting factor in current multimode fiber fed
instruments (Baudrand & Walker 2001), can be eliminated by proper design, and
the diffraction limited input to the spectrograph allows for very compact
instrument designs, which provide excellent optomechanical stability. A SMF is
the ideal interface for new, very precise wavelength calibrators, like laser
frequency combs (Steinmetz et al. 2008, Osterman et al. 2012), or SMF based
Fabry-Perot Etalons (Halverson et al. 2012). At near infrared wavelengths,

shocks. Aims. We aim to study the circumstellar environment and wind-ISM
interaction of the nearest red supergiant, Betelgeuse. Methods. Herschel PACS
images at 70, 100, and 160 micron and SPIRE images at 250, 350, and 500 micron
were obtained by scanning the region around Betelgeuse. These data were
complemented with ultraviolet GALEX data, near-infrared WISE data, and radio 21
cm GALFA-HI data. The observational properties of the bow shock structure were
deduced from the data and compared with hydrodynamical simulations. Results.
The infrared Herschel images of the environment around Betelgeuse are
spectacular, showing the occurrence of multiple arcs at 6-7 arcmin from the
central target and the presence of a linear bar at 9 arcmin. Remarkably, no
large-scale instabilities are seen in the outer arcs and linear bar. The dust
temperature in the outer arcs varies between 40 and 140 K, with the linear bar
having the same colour temperature as the arcs. The inner envelope shows clear
evidence of a non-homogeneous clumpy structure (beyond 15 arcsec), probably
related to the giant convection cells of the outer atmosphere. The
non-homogeneous distribution of the material even persists until the collision
with the ISM. A strong variation in brightness of the inner clumps at a radius
of 2 arcmin suggests a drastic change in mean gas and dust density some 32 000
yr ago. Using hydrodynamical simulations, we try to explain the observed
morphology of the bow shock around Betelgeuse. Conclusions: [abbreviated]

a supervised post-picking strategy for the classification of boxed particle

particle picking routines. MAPPOS employs machine learning techniques to train
a robust classifier from a small number of characteristic image features. In
order to accurately quantify the performance of MAPPOS we used simulated
particle and non-particle images. In addition, we verified our method by
applying it to an experimental cryo-EM dataset and comparing the results to the
manual classification of the same dataset. Comparisons between MAPPOS and
manual post-picking classification by several human experts demonstrated that
merely a few hundred sample images are sufficient for MAPPOS to classify an
entire dataset with a human-like performance. MAPPOS was shown to greatly
accelerate the throughput of large datasets by reducing the manual workload by
orders of magnitude while maintaining a reliable identification of non-particle
images.

that wavelength with a specific design for the slit depth, slit dielectric, and
inter-slit distance in the deep sub-wavelength regime. In this sense,
surface-plasmon mediated light transmission becomes wavelength sensitive in our
model, and a single light beam can be separated into two according to its
wavelength in the transverse direction parallel to the array. This provides us
with a unique way for direct optical reading in the near-field region using a

scattering interactions, which, respectively, drive ferromagnetism (FM) and
electronic nematic order via a d-wave Pomeranchuk instability (dPI). The FM and
dPI in general compete with each other and they are typically separated by a
first order phase boundary in the plane of the chemical potential and
temperature. Nevertheless there is a parameter region where the dPI occurs
inside the FM phase, leading to their coexistence. We also study the effect of
a magnetic field by choosing a chemical potential where the ground state is
paramagnetic without a field. In this case, instead of FM, the dPI competes
with a metamagnetic instability. The latter occurs above a threshold strength
of the FM interaction and otherwise the dPI is stabilized with a dome-shaped
phase diagram in the plane of a magnetic field and temperature. The FM
interaction shifts the center of the dome to a lower field, accompanied by a
substantial reduction of the field range where the dPI is stabilized and by an
extension of the first order part of the transition line, although the maximal
critical temperature does not change. The experimental phase diagram of the
bilayer ruthenate Sr3Ru2O7 can be well captured by the present theory.

the potentially strong gravitational interaction that an Earth-like planet may

Recent progress in this field, however, allows to identify regions around the

shown that terrestrial planets can be detected in solar-type binary stars using
current observational facilities, it remains to be shown whether this is also
the case for Earth analogues in habitable zones. We provide analytical
expressions for the maximum and RMS values of radial velocity and astrometric
signals, as well as transit probabilities of terrestrial planets in such

their spins are highly correlated. The structure of these correlations varies
significantly over top production phase space, allowing very detailed tests of
the Standard Model. Here, we explore top quark spin correlation measurement
from a general perspective, highlighting the role of azimuthal decay angles. By
taking differences and sums of these angles about the top-antitop production
axis, the presence of spin correlations can be seen as sinusoidal modulations
resulting from the interference of different helicity channels. At the LHC,
these modulations exhibit nontrivial evolution from near-threshold production
into the boosted regime, where they become sensitive to almost the entire QCD
correlation effect for centrally produced tops. We demonstrate that this form
of spin correlation measurement is very robust under full kinematic
reconstruction, and should already be observable with high significance using
the current LHC data set. We also illustrate some novel ways that new physics
can alter the azimuthal distributions. In particular, we estimate the power of
our proposed measurements in probing for anomalous color-dipole operators, as
well as for broad resonances with parity-violating couplings. Using these
methods, the 2012 run of the LHC may be capable of setting simultaneous limits

Jefferson Lab. Within the first year of data taking with the Hall B CLAS12
detector following the 12 GeV upgrade, a dedicated experiment will aim to
extract the N* electrocouplings at high photon virtualities Q2. This experiment
will allow exploration of the structure of N* resonances at the highest photon
virtualities ever yet achieved, with a kinematic reach up to Q2 = 12 GeV2. This
high-Q2 reach will make it possible to probe the excited nucleon structures at
distance scales ranging from where effective degrees of freedom, such as
constituent quarks, are dominant through the transition to where nearly
massless bare-quark degrees of freedom are relevant. In this document, we
present a detailed description of the physics that can be addressed through N*
structure studies in exclusive meson electroproduction. The discussion includes
recent advances in reaction theory for extracting N* electrocouplings from
meson electroproduction off protons, along with QCD-based approaches to the
theoretical interpretation of these fundamental quantities. This program will
afford access to the dynamics of the non-perturbative strong interaction
responsible for resonance formation, and will be crucial in understanding the
nature of confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in baryons, and
how excited nucleons emerge from QCD.

The main objectives of Part 1 are to
postulate a new principle of representation invariance (PRI), and to refine the
unified field model of four interactions, derived using the principle of
interaction dynamics (PID). Intuitively, PID takes the variation of the action
functional under energy-momentum conservation constraint, and PRI requires that
physical laws be independent of representations of the gauge groups. One
important outcome of this field model is a natural duality between the
interacting fields and the adjoint bosonic fields. This duality predicts two
Higgs particles of similar mass with one due to weak interaction and the other
due to strong interaction. The field model can be naturally decoupled to study
individual interactions, leading to 1) modified Einstein equations, giving rise
to a unified theory for dark matter and dark energy, 2) three levels of strong
interaction potentials for quark, nucleon/hadron, and atom respectively, and 3)
two weak interaction potentials. These potential/force formulas offer a clear
mechanism for both quark confinement and asymptotic freedom. The main
objectives of Part 2 are 1) to propose a sub-leptons and sub-quark model, which
we call weakton model, and 2) to derive a mechanism for all sub-atomic decays
and bremsstrahlung. The weakton model postulates that all matter particles and
mediators are made up of massless weaktons. The weakton model offers a perfect
explanation for all sub-atomic decays and all generation/annihilation precesses
of matter-antimatter. In particular, the precise constituents of particles
involved in all decays both before and after the reaction can now be precisely
derived. In addition, the bremsstrahlung phenomena can be understood using the
weakton model. Also, the weakton model offers an explanation to the baryon
asymmetry problem.

significant costs to the system operators. The added costs depend on several
factors including market design, performance of renewable generation
forecasting and the specific dispatch procedure. Quantifying these costs has
been limited to small sample Monte Carlo approaches applied specific dispatch
algorithms. The computational complexity and accuracy of these approaches has
limited the understanding of tradeoffs between different factors. {In this work
we consider a two-stage stochastic economic dispatch problem. Our goal is to
provide an analytical quantification and an intuitive understanding of the
effects of uncertainties and network congestion on the dispatch procedure and
the optimal cost.} We first consider an uncongested network and calculate the
risk limiting dispatch. In addition, we derive the price of uncertainty, a
number that characterizes the intrinsic impact of uncertainty on the
integration cost of renewables. Then we extend the results to a network where
one link can become congested. Under mild conditions, we calculate price of
uncertainty even in this case. We show that risk limiting dispatch is given by
a set of deterministic equilibrium equations. The dispatch solution yields an
important insight: congested links do not create isolated nodes, even in a
two-node network. In fact, the network can support backflows in congested
links, that are useful to reduce the uncertainty by averaging supply across the
network. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in standard IEEE
benchmark networks.

luge accident at the Vancouver Olympics. It shows that this runner-fillet
interaction, and specifically the fillet's positive curvature up the inside
wall, can cause a vertical velocity more than sufficient to clear the outside
exit wall. In addition its negative curvature along the track, together with
large vertical velocity, explains loss of fillet or wall contact and slider
ejection. This exposes the fillet along inside walls as a track design flaw. A
more transparent design and review process could provide a wider, more complete
and thorough design and verification scrutiny by competent scientists and
engineers without financial involvement or conflicts of interest and
potentially lead to safer future designs.

investigate H\alpha\ emission flux from bright [OII] emitters as well as faint
ones for which H\alpha\ is not individually detected, and to compare them with
a large sample of local galaxies. We find that there is a clear, positive
correlation between the average H\alpha\ and [OII] luminosities for [OII]
emitters at z=1.47, with its slope being consistent with the local relation.
[OII] emitters at z=1.47 have lower mean observed ratios of H\alpha/[OII]
suggesting a small but systematic offset (at 2.8\sigma\ significance) towards
lower values of dust attenuation, A(H\alpha)~0.35, than local galaxies. This
confirms that [OII] selection tends to pick up galaxies which are significantly
less dusty on average than H\alpha\ selected ones, with the difference being
higher at z=1.47 than at z=0. The discrepancy of the observed line ratios
between [OII] emitters at z=1.47 and the local galaxies may in part be due to
the samples having different metallicities. However, we demonstrate that
metallicity is unlikely to be the main cause. Therefore, it is important to
take into account that the relations for the dust correction which are derived
using H\alpha\ emitter samples, and frequently used in many studies of high-z
galaxies, may overestimate the intrinsic SFRs of [OII]-selected galaxies, and
that surveys of [OII] emission galaxies are likely to miss dusty populations.

growth phenomenon. As the system size $P$ measured as population in cities or
active users in online communities increases, the total activities $X$ measured
as GDP or number of new patents, crimes in cities generated by these people
also increases but in a faster rate. This accelerating growth phenomenon can be
well described by a super-linear power law $X \propto P^{\gamma}$($\gamma>1$).
However, the explanation on this phenomenon is still lack. In this paper, we
propose a modeling framework called growing random geometric models to explain
the super-linear relationship. A growing network is constructed on an abstract
geometric space. The new coming node can only survive if it just locates on an
appropriate place in the space where other nodes exist, then new edges are
connected with the adjacent nodes whose number is determined by the density of
existing nodes. Thus the total number of edges can grow with the number of
nodes in a faster speed exactly following the super-linear power law. The
models cannot only reproduce a lot of observed phenomena in complex networks,
e.g., scale-free degree distribution and asymptotically size-invariant
clustering coefficient, but also resemble the known patterns of cities, such as
fractal growing, area-population and diversity-population scaling relations,
etc. Strikingly, only one important parameter, the dimension of the geometric
space, can really influence the super-linear growth exponent $\gamma$.

  Distribution Answer",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Peer-to-Peer (P2P) technology has been regarded as a promising way to help
Content Providers (CPs) cost-effectively distribute content. However, under the
traditional Internet pricing mechanism, the fact that most P2P traffic flows
among peers can dramatically decrease the profit of ISPs, who may take actions
against P2P and impede the progress of P2P technology. In this paper, we
develop a mathematical framework to analyze such economic issues. Inspired by
the idea from cooperative game theory, we propose a cooperative
profit-distribution model based on Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS), in which
eyeball ISPs and Peer-assisted CPs (PCPs) form two coalitions respectively and
then compute a fair Pareto point to determine profit distribution. Moreover, we
design a fair and feasible mechanism for profit distribution within each
coalition. We show that such a cooperative method not only guarantees the fair
profit distribution among network participators, but also helps to improve the
economic efficiency of the overall network system. To our knowledge, this is
the first work that systematically studies solutions for P2P caused unbalanced
profit distribution and gives a feasible cooperative method to increase and
fairly share profit.

challenging for high-dimensional dynamical systems where data is received

The sequential particle filter is then impractical and ad hoc filters, which

these ad hoc filters is the 3DVAR method. The goal of this paper is to analyze
the 3DVAR method, using the Lorenz '63 model to exemplify the key ideas. The
situation where the data is partial and noisy is studied, and both discrete

how the widely used technique of variance inflation acts to stabilize the

high-transition-temperature (Tc) superconductivity except for copper oxides.
The recent finding of the Mott insulating state right beside superconductivity
in Cs3C60 has suggested that magnetism helps raise Tc even in fullerides as in
heavy-fermion compounds, high-Tc copper oxides, two-dimensional organic
conductors, and iron pnictides. Namely, one tends to think that the link
between Mott insulator and superconductivity takes place in fullerides, which
can give rise to the mechanism beyond the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer framework.
However, the relationship between the Mott state and the superconductivity in
Cs3C60 is still under debate. By nuclear magnetic resonance measurements under
pressure, we find that the magnetism and superconductivity in Cs3C60 are
competing orders. Different from previous reports, the phase separation of
Cs3C60 crystals into the Mott and metallic states allows us to systematically
study the evolution of the ground state under pressure. Our careful experiments
have found that the prevention of a magnetic order is rather essential for the
superconductivity in face-centred cubic Cs3C60, which presents a basic strategy
for finding still higher Tc in this system.

perpendicularly oriented magnetic domains form a striped pattern. As
temperature is increased the system can undergo a spin reorientation transition
into a state with in-plane magnetization. Here we present Monte Carlo
simulations of such a magnetic film containing a periodic array of non-magnetic
defects. We find that the presence of defects stabilizes parallel orientation
of stripes against thermal fluctuations at low temperatures. Above the spin
reorientation temperature we find that defects favor perpendicular spin
alignment and disrupt long range ordering of spin components parallel to the

a reduction in the spontaneous magnetization.

types of multiscale decomposition by either frequency or frequency and
amplitude, are proposed and analyzed for solving highly oscillatory second
order differential equations with a dimensionless parameter
$0<\varepsilon\le1$. In fact, the solution to this equation propagates waves
with wavelength at $O(\varepsilon^2)$ when $0<\varepsilon\ll 1$, which brings
significantly numerical burdens in practical computation. We rigorously
establish two independent error bounds for the two MTIs at
$O(\tau^2/\varepsilon^2)$ and $O(\varepsilon^2)$ for $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ with
$\tau>0$ as step size, which imply that the two MTIs converge uniformly with
linear convergence rate at $O(\tau)$ for $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ and optimally
with quadratic convergence rate at $O(\tau^2)$ in the regimes when either
$\varepsilon=O(1)$ or $0<\varepsilon\le \tau$. Thus the meshing strategy
requirement (or $\varepsilon$-scalability) of the two MTIs is $\tau=O(1)$ for
$0<\varepsilon\ll 1$, which is significantly improved from
$\tau=O(\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tau=O(\varepsilon^2)$ requested by finite
difference methods and exponential wave integrators to the equation,
respectively. Extensive numerical tests and comparisons with those classical
numerical integrators are reported, which gear towards better understanding on
the convergence and resolution properties of the two MTIs. In addition,
numerical results support the two error bounds very well.

visualization. Signals detected at each element are sampled prior to digital
beamforming. The required sampling rates are up to 4 times the Nyquist rate of
the signal and result in considerable amount of data, that needs to be stored
and processed. A developed technique, based on the finite rate of innovation
model, compressed sensing (CS) and Xampling ideas, allows to reduce the number
of samples needed to reconstruct an image comprised of strong reflectors. A
significant drawback of this method is its inability to treat speckle, which is
of significant importance in medical imaging. Here we build on previous work
and show explicitly how to perform beamforming in the Fourier domain.
Beamforming in frequency exploits the low bandwidth of the beamformed signal
and allows to bypass the oversampling dictated by digital implementation of
beamforming in time. We show that this allows to obtain the same beamformed
image as in standard beamforming but from far fewer samples. Finally, we
present an analysis based CS-technique that allows for further reduction in
sampling rate, using only a portion of the beamformed signal's bandwidth,
namely, sampling the signal at sub-Nyquist rates. We demonstrate our methods on
in vivo cardiac ultrasound data and show that reductions up to 1/25 over

uniqueness as well as nonexistence of the ground state under different

Well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for both equations and finite time blowup
in 2D are analyzed. Finally, we rigorously prove the convergence and linear

claimed that the kinematics and three-dimensional location of the M-giant stars
in this structure constrain the dark matter halo of our Galaxy to possess a
triaxial shape that is extremely flattened, being essentially an oblate
ellipsoid oriented perpendicular to the Galactic disk. Using a new
stream-fitting algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure, we
investigate whether this claim remains valid if we allow the density profile of
the Milky Way halo greater freedom. We find stream solutions that fit the
leading and trailing arms of this structure even in a spherical halo, although
this would need a rising Galactic rotation curve at large Galactocentric
radius. However, the required rotation curve is not ruled out by current
constraints. It appears therefore that for the Milky Way, halo triaxiality,
despite its strong theoretical motivation, is not required to explain the
Sagittarius stream. This degeneracy between triaxiality and the halo density
profile suggests that in future endeavors to model this structure, it will be
advantageous to relax the strict analytic density profiles that have been used
to date.

example systems, we study typical InGaAs quantum dots in a GaAs photonic
crystal structures -- an $Ln$ cavity or a $\mathit{W1}$ waveguide. For a single
dot, we reproduce known analytical results, while for the two dot case, we
study the radiative excitation transfer mechanism and characterize its
strength, the dependence on the detuning between quantum dot and photon modes,
and the dependence on inter-dot distance. We find in particular that the
inter-dot radiative coupling strength can reach $100 \mu{eV}$ in a short

determined by the group velocity of the exchanged photons and their radiative
lifetime. We also show that, for an $Ln$ cavity of increasing length, the
radiative excitation transfer mechanism is subject to a crossover from a regime
where a single photon mode is dominating, to a multi-mode regime -- occurring

experiments on thin sheets of composite thermally responsive gels [1]. Such
sheets bend perpendicularly to the periodic axis in order to alleviate the
metric discrepancy. For abruptly varying metrics, we identify multiple scaling
regimes with different power law dependences of the elastic energy $\En$ and
the axial curvature $\kappa$ on the sheet's thickness $h$. In the $h\to0$ limit
the equilibrium configuration tends to an isometric embedding of the reference
metric, and $\En\sim h^2$. Two intermediate asymptotic regimes emerge in
between the buckling threshold and the $h\to0$ limit, in which the energy
scales either like $h^{4/5}$ or like $h^{2/3}$. We believe that this system
exemplifies a much more general phenomenon, in which the thickness of the sheet
induces a cutoff length scale below which finer structures of the metric cannot
be observed. When the reference metric consists of several separated length
scales, a decrease of the sheet's thickness results in a sequence of
conformational changes, as finer properties of the reference metric are
revealed.

the corresponding branching ratios is given, emphasizing that the sizable decay
width difference $\Delta\Gamma_s$ of the $B_s$-meson system affects the $B_s\to
\mu^+\mu^-$ channel. As a consequence, the calculated Standard Model branching
ratio has to be upscaled by about 10% to BR$(B_s\to
\mu^+\mu^-)=(3.54\pm0.30)\times 10^{-9}$. This prediction is the reference
value for the comparison with the time-integrated experimental branching ratio,
where LHCb has recently reported $(3.2^{+1.5}_{-1.2})\times10^{-9}$
corresponding to the first evidence for $B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$. The
$\Delta\Gamma_s$ effects have also to be included in the constraints on the
parameter space of New-Physics models following from the experimental data.
Furthermore, $\Delta\Gamma_s$ makes a new observable through the effective
$B_s\to \mu^+\mu^-$ lifetime accessible, which probes New Physics in a way
complementary to the branching ratio and adds an exciting new topic to the
agenda for the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC.

They are related to the well-known Wishart processes in a simple way: the
latter are obtained from the former via the map $x\mapsto x^\top x$. The main
focus is on existence and uniqueness via the theory of Dirichlet forms. This
leads us to develop new results of potential theoretic nature concerning the
space of real square matrices. Specifically, the function $w(x)=|\det
x|^\alpha$ is a weight function in the Muckenhoupt $A_p$ class for
$-1<\alpha\le 0$ ($p=1$) and $-1<\alpha<p-1$ ($p>1$). The set of matrices of
co-rank at least two has zero capacity with respect to the measure $m(dx)=|\det

of all singular matrices. As a consequence we obtain density results for
Sobolev spaces over (the interior of) $E$ with Neumann boundary conditions. The

an important role in the mass loading and heating of the corona. We analyse the
disc counterpart to type II spicules, RBEs, in three high quality datasets from
CRISP at the SST. In a quiet Sun region at disc centre we find lower Doppler
velocities, 15-40km/s, and Doppler widths, 2-15km/s, of RBEs than in earlier
coronal hole studies, 30-50km/s and 7-23km/s, respectively. We examine the
spatial dependence of Doppler velocities and widths along RBE axes and conclude
that there is no clear trend over the FOV or in individual RBEs in quiet Sun at
disc centre. These differences with previous coronal hole studies are
attributed to the more varying magnetic field configuration in quiet Sun
conditions. Using an extremely high cadence dataset allowed us to improve
greatly on the determination of lifetimes of RBEs, found to range from 5 to 60s
with an average of 30s, as well as the transverse motions in RBEs, with
transverse velocities up to 55km/s and averaging 12km/s. Furthermore, our
measurements of the recurrence rates of RBEs provide important new constraints
on coronal heating by spicules. We also see many examples of a sinusoidal wave
pattern in the transverse motion with periods averaging 54s and amplitudes from
21.5 to 129km, agreeing well with previous studies of wave motion in limb
spicules. We interpret the appearance of RBEs over their full length within a
few seconds as the result of a combination of three kinds of motions as
reported earlier for spicules. Finally, we look at the temporal connection
between Ha and Ca 8542 RBEs and find Ca 8542 in addition to being located
closer to the footpoint also appear before the Ha RBE. This connection supports
the idea that heating occurs in spicules and contribute more weight to the
prominence of spicules as a source for heating and mass loading of the corona.

biology. As an alternative to the classical Turing bifurcation, it has been
proposed that the cell polarity might onset by means of the well-known
phenomenon of wave-pinning (Gamba et al, PNAS, 2005). A particularly simple and
elegant model of wave-pinning has been proposed by Edelstein-Keshet and
coworkers (Biop. J., 2008). However, biomolecular networks do communicate with
other networks as well as with the external world. As such, their dynamics has
to be considered as perturbed by extrinsic noises. These noises may have both a
spatial and a temporal correlation, but any case they must be bounded to
preserve the biological meaningfulness of the perturbed parameters. Here we
numerically show that the inclusion of external spatio-temporal bounded
perturbations may sometime destroy the polarized state. The polarization loss
depends on both the extent of temporal and spatial correlations, and on the
kind of adopted noise. Namely, independently of the specific model of noise, an
increase of the spatial correlation induces an increase of the probability of
polarization. However, if the noise is spatially homogeneous then the
polarization is lost in the majority of cases. On the contrary, an increase of
the temporal autocorrelation of the noise induces an effect that depends on the
noise model.

exponentially in the number of particles, one has to consider appropriate

minimization of the Rayleigh quotient. The Alternating Least Squares technique
is then applied to break down the eigenvector computation to problems of
appropriate size, which can be solved by classical methods. Efficient

inner product of two decomposed vectors. To this end, both appropriate
representations of vectors and efficient contraction schemes are needed.
  Here approaches from many-body quantum physics for one-dimensional and
two-dimensional systems (Matrix Product States and Projected Entangled Pair

generalizations of these concepts and show that they still allow efficient

cyclotron orbits. Evidence for the formation of superlattice minibands (so
called Hofstadter's butterfly) has been limited to the observation of new
low-field oscillations and an internal structure within Landau levels. Here we
report transport properties of graphene placed on a boron nitride substrate and
accurately aligned along its crystallographic directions. The substrate's moire

Second-generation Dirac points appear as pronounced peaks in resistivity
accompanied by reversal of the Hall effect. The latter indicates that the sign

collisions - particle pairs undergo a large number of collisions against each
other during a small time interval over which, hence, they remain close to each
other. A theoretical framework is provided for describing and quantifying this
phenomenon and it is substantiated by numerical simulations. Furthermore, the
impact of hydrodynamic interactions is discussed for such a system of colliding
particles.

of Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe: DM structures are responsible for the
bending of light in the weak lensing regime and those same objects can emit
gamma-rays, either because they host astrophysical sources (active galactic
nuclei or star-forming galaxies) or directly by DM annihilations (or decays,
depending on the properties of the DM particle). Such gamma-rays should
therefore exhibit strong correlation with the cosmic shear signal. In this
Letter, we compute the cross-correlation angular power spectrum of cosmic shear
and gamma-rays produced by the annihilation/decay of Weakly Interacting Massive
Particle (WIMP) DM, as well as from astrophysical sources. We show that this
observable provides novel information on the composition of the Extra-galactic
Gamma-ray Background (EGB), since the amplitude and shape of the
cross-correlation signal strongly depends on which class of source is
responsible for the gamma-ray emission. If the DM contribution to the EGB is
significant (at least in a definite energy range), although compatible with
current observational bounds, its strong correlation with the cosmic shear
makes such signal potentially detectable by combining Fermi-LAT data with
forthcoming galaxy surveys, like Dark Energy Survey and Euclid. At the same
time, the same signal would demonstrate that the weak lensing observables are
indeed due to particle DM matter and not to possible modifications of General
Relativity.

system where multiple users share multiple discrete subcarriers, but at most
one user is allowed to transmit power on each subcarrier. To adapt fast traffic
and channel fluctuations and improve the spectrum efficiency, the system should
have the ability to dynamically allocate subcarriers and power resources to
users. Assuming perfect channel knowledge, two formulations for the joint
subcarrier and power allocation problem are considered in this paper: the first
is to minimize the total transmission power subject to quality of service
constraints and the OFDMA constraint, and the second is to maximize some system
utility function (including the sum-rate utility, the proportional fairness
utility, the harmonic mean utility, and the min-rate utility) subject to the
total transmission power constraint per user and the OFDMA constraint. In spite
of the existence of various heuristics approaches, little is known about the
computational complexity status of the above problem. This paper aims to fill
this theoretical gap, i.e., characterizing the complexity of the joint
subcarrier and power allocation problem for the multi-user OFDMA system. It is
shown in this paper that both formulations of the joint subcarrier and power
allocation problem are strongly NP-hard. The proof is based on a polynomial
time transformation from the so-called 3-dimensional matching problem. Several
subclasses of the problem which can be solved to global optimality or
$\epsilon$-global optimality in polynomial time are also identified. These
complexity results suggest that there are not polynomial time algorithms which
are able to solve the general joint subcarrier and power allocation problem to
global optimality (unless P$=$NP), and determining an approximately optimal
subcarrier and power allocation strategy is more realistic in practice.

the HRC-S detector and the LETG grating on day 18 after the observed visual

10^(-11) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1), corresponding to unabsorbed luminosity 7-8.5 x
10^(36)x(d/12 kpc)^2 for N(H)=2-2.7x10^(21) cm^(-2). On day 18, 70% of the soft
X-tray flux was in a continuum typical of a very hot white dwarf (WD)
atmosphere, which accounted for about 80% of the flux on days 23 and 35. In
addition all spectra display very broad emission lines, due to higher
ionization stages at later times.
  With Chandra we observed apparent P Cygni profiles. We find that these
peculiar profiles are not due to blue shifted absorption and red shifted
emission in photoionized ejecta, like the optical P Cyg of novae, but they are
rather a superposition of WD atmospheric absorption features reflected by the
already discovered Thomson scattering corona, and emission lines due to
collisional ionization in condensations in the ejecta. On days 23 and 35 the
absorption components were no longer measurable, having lost the initial large
blue shift that displaced them from the core of the broad emission lines. We
interpret this as indication that mass loss ceased between day 18 and day 23.
On day 35, the emission lines spectrum became very complex, with several
different components. Model atmospheres indicate that the WD atmospheric
temperature was about 730,000 K on day 18 and reached 900,000 K--one million K
on day 35. This peak temperature is consistent with a WD mass of at least 1.3
M(sol).

eliminates the bottlenecks and reduces the decoding delay experienced by users

its presence is tightly related to the formation and destruction of water. This
paper presents OH observations from 23 low- and intermediate-mass young stellar
objects obtained with the PACS integral field spectrometer on-board Herschel in
the context of the Water In Star-forming Regions with Herschel (WISH) key
program. Most low-mass sources have compact OH emission (< 5000 AU scale),
whereas the OH lines in most intermediate-mass sources are extended over the
whole PACS detector field-of-view (> 20000 AU). The strength of the OH emission
is correlated with various source properties such as the bolometric luminosity
and the envelope mass, but also with the OI and H2O emission. Rotational
diagrams for sources with many OH lines show that the level populations of OH
can be approximated by a Boltzmann distribution with an excitation temperature
at around 70 K. Radiative transfer models of spherically symmetric envelopes
cannot reproduce the OH emission fluxes nor their broad line widths, strongly
suggesting an outflow origin. Slab excitation models indicate that the observed
excitation temperature can either be reached if the OH molecules are exposed to
a strong far-infrared continuum radiation field or if the gas temperature and
density are sufficiently high. Using realistic source parameters and radiation
fields, it is shown for the case of Ser SMM1 that radiative pumping plays an
important role in transitions arising from upper level energies higher than 300
K. The compact emission in the low-mass sources and the required presence of a
strong radiation field and/or a high density to excite the OH molecules points
towards an origin in shocks in the inner envelope close to the protostar.

the related literature on maximizing this network cover assumes that the social

In practice, however, the network topology is generally unknown and needs to be
discovered on-the-fly. In this work we consider an unknown topology where
recruited individuals disclose their social connections (a feature known as
{\em one-hop lookahead}). The goal of this work is to provide an efficient
greedy online algorithm that recruits individuals as to maximize the size of

  We propose a new greedy online algorithm, Maximum Expected $d$-Excess Degree

we denote MOD (Maximum Observed Degree). We substantiate our analytical results

that all their partial transposes are positive, these are called PPT states. We
classify a PPT state by the ranks of the state itself and its three single
partial transposes. In random numerical searches we find entangled PPT states
with a large variety of rank combinations. For ranks equal to five or higher we
find both extremal and nonextremal PPT states of nearly every rank combination,
with the restriction that the square sum of the four ranks of an extremal PPT
state can be at most 193. We have studied especially the rank four entangled
PPT states, which are found to have rank four for every partial transpose.
These states are all extremal, because of the previously known result that
every PPT state of rank three or less is separable. We find two distinct
classes of rank 4444 entangled PPT states, identified by a real valued
quadratic expression invariant under local SL(2,C) transformations,
mathematically equivalent to Lorentz transformations. This quadratic Lorentz
invariant is nonzero for one class of states (type I in our terminology) and
zero for the other class (type II). The previously known states based on
unextendible product bases is a nongeneric subclass of the type I states. We
present analytical constructions of states of both types, general enough to
reproduce all the rank 4444 PPT states we have found numerically. We can not
exclude the possibility that there exist nongeneric rank four PPT states that
we do not find in our random numerical searches.

primarily probe the outer hydrogen-rich zones of the ejecta. The SINFONI
observations were obtained in 2005 and 2011 and instead probe the [Si I]/[Fe
II] emission from the inner regions. We find a strong temporal evolution of the
morphology in the HST images, from a roughly elliptical shape before ~5,000
days, to a more irregular, edge-brightened morphology thereafter. This
transition is a natural consequence of the change in the dominant energy source
powering the ejecta, from radioactive decay before ~5,000 days to X-ray input
from the circumstellar interaction thereafter. The [Si I]/[Fe II] images
display a more uniform morphology, which may be due to a remaining significant
contribution from radioactivity in the inner ejecta and the higher abundance of
these elements in the core. Both the H-alpha and the [Si I]/[Fe II] line
profiles show that the ejecta are distributed fairly close to the plane of the
inner circumstellar ring, which is assumed to define the rotational axis of the
progenitor. The H-alpha emission extends to higher velocities than [Si I]/[Fe
II] as expected. There is no clear symmetry axis for all the emission and we
are unable to model the ejecta distribution with a simple ellipsoid model with
a uniform distribution of dust. Instead, we find that the emission is
concentrated to clumps and that the emission is distributed somewhat closer to
the ring in the north than in the south. This north-south asymmetry may be
partially explained by dust absorption. We compare our results with explosion
models and find some qualitative agreement, but note that the observations show
a higher degree of large-scale asymmetry.

[O I], [Ca II] and a feature at 9220 A. We identify the latter line with Mg II
9218, 9244,most likely pumped by Ly-alpha fluorescence. H-alpha, and H-beta
both have a centrally peaked component, extending to 4500 km/s and a very broad
component extending to 11,000 km/s, while the other lines have only the central
component. The low velocity component comes from unshocked ejecta, heated
mainly by X-rays from the circumstellar ring collision, whereas the broad
component comes from faster ejecta passing through the reverse shock. The
reverse shock flux in H-alpha has increased by a factor of 4-6 from 2000 to
2007. After that there is a tendency of flattening of the light curve, similar
to what may be seen in soft X-rays and in the optical lines from the shocked
ring. The core component seen in H-alpha, [Ca II] and Mg II has experienced a
similar increase, consistent with that found from HST photometry. The ring-like
morphology of the ejecta is explained as a result of the X-ray illumination,
depositing energy outside of the core of the ejecta. The energy deposition in
the ejecta of the external X-rays illumination is calculated using explosion
models for SN 1987A and we predict that the outer parts of the unshocked ejecta
will continue to brighten because of this. We finally discuss evidence for dust
in the ejecta from line asymmetries.

motor control and associative neural computation in the brain. Autonomous
dynamics involving sequences of transiently stable states have been termed
associative latching in the context of grammar generation. We propose that
generating functionals allow for a systematic construction of dynamical
networks with well characterized dynamical behavior, such as regular or
intermittent bursting latching dynamics.
  Coupling local, slowly adapting variables to an attractor network allows to
destabilize all attractors, turning them into attractor ruins. The resulting
attractor relict network may show ongoing autonomous latching dynamics. We
propose to use two generating functionals for the construction of attractor
relict networks. The first functional is a simple Hopfield energy functional,
known to generate a neural attractor network. The second generating functional,
which we denote polyhomeostatic optimization, is based on
information-theoretical principles, encoding the information content of the
neural firing statistics. Polyhomeostatic optimization destabilizes the
attractors of the Hopfield network inducing latching dynamics.
  We investigate the influence of stress, in terms of conflicting optimization
targets, on the resulting dynamics. Objective function stress is absent when
the target level for the mean of neural activities is identical for the two
generating functionals and the resulting latching dynamics is then found to be
regular. Objective function stress is present when the respective target
activity levels differ, inducing intermittent bursting latching dynamics. We
propose that generating functionals may be useful quite generally for the

whereby an image is formed from light that has never interacted with the
object. In ghost imaging experiments two correlated light fields are produced.
One of these fields illuminates the object, and the other field is measured by
a spatially resolving detector. In the quantum regime, these correlated light
fields are produced by entangled photons created by spontaneous parametric
down-conversion. To date, all correlated-photon ghost-imaging experiments have
scanned a single-pixel detector through the field of view to obtain the spatial
information. However, scanning leads to a poor sampling efficiency, which
scales inversely with the number of pixels, N, in the image. In this work we
overcome this limitation by using a time-gated camera to record the
single-photon events across the full scene. We obtain high-contrast images,
90%, in either the image plane or the far-field of the photon pair source,
taking advantage of the EPR-like correlations in position and momentum of the
photon pairs. Our images contain a large number of modes, >500, creating
opportunities in low-light-level imaging and in quantum information processing.

exciton-phonon problem is revisited for investigating exciton-mediated energy
flow in a finite-size lattice. Within this method, the exciton-phonon
entanglement is taken into account through a dual dressing mechanism so that
exciton and phonons are treated on an equal footing. In a marked contrast with
what happens in an infinite lattice, it is shown that the dynamics of the
exciton density is governed by several time scales. The density evolves
coherently in the short-time limit whereas a relaxation mechanism occurs over
intermediated time scales. Consequently, in the long-time limit, the density
converges toward a nearly uniform distributed equilibrium distribution. Such a
behavior results from quantum decoherence that originates in the fact that the
phonons evolve differently depending on the path followed by the exciton to
tunnel along the lattice. Although the relaxation rate increases with the
temperature and with the coupling, it decreases with the lattice size,
suggesting that the decoherence is inherent to the confinement.

  The extremal problem on estimating the maximum possible size of

own interest in combinatorial number theory and application to coding theory.
Let $a$, $b$ be positive integers such that $a<b$ and the greatest common

$i\in [n]$ randomly and independently with probability $p$. We show that the

$\frac{b}{b+p}pn+O(\sqrt{pn}\log n \log \log n)$ with probability that goes to
1 as $n\to \infty$.

history of the samples during the mixing process was monitored and adjusted to
identical final temperatures. The filler structure on large scales up to
micrometers was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and very
small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). A complete quantitative model extending
from the primary silica nanoparticle (of radius \approx 10 nm), to
nanoparticles aggregates, up to micrometer-sized branches with typical lateral
dimension of 150 nm is proposed. Image analysis of the TEM-pictures yields the
fraction of zones of pure polymer, which extend between the branches of a
large-scale filler network. This network is compatible with a fractal of
average dimension 2.4 as measured by scattering. On smaller length scales,
inside the branches, small silica aggregates are present. Their average radius
has been deduced from a Kratky analysis, and it ranges between 35 and 40 nm for
all silica fractions investigated here (\phi_si = 8-21% vol.). A central piece
of our analysis is the description of the interaggregate interaction by a
simulated structure factor for polydisperse spheres representing aggregates. A
polydispersity of 30% in aggregate size is assumed, and interactions between
these aggregates are described with a hard core repulsive potential. The same
distribution in size is used to evaluate the polydisperse form factor.
Comparison with the experimental intensity leads to the determination of the
average aggregate compacity (assumed identical for all aggregates in the
distribution, between 31% and 38% depending on \phi_si), and thus aggregation
number (ca. 45, with a large spread). Because of the effect of aggregate
compacity and of pure polymer zones, the volume fraction of aggregates is
higher in the branches than \phi_si. The repulsion between aggregates has a
strong effect on the apparent isothermal compressibility: it leads to a
characteristic low-q depression, which cannot be interpreted as aggregate mass
decrease in our data. In addition, the reinforcement effect of these silica
structures in the SBR-matrix is characterized with oscillatory shear and
described with a model based on the same aggregate compacity. Finally, our
results show that it is possible to analyze the complex structure of
interacting aggregates in nanocomposites of industrial origin in a
self-consistent and quantitative manner.

that did not detect an error, the posterior error probability is suppressed to

this enhanced construction. In fault-tolerant quantum computing, this

rather differently from a dynamical point of view (because that evolution
depends on the internal environment) through a variety of processes that tend
progressively to segregate stars more massive than the average towards the
cluster centre. Therefore clusters with the same chronological age may have
reached quite different stages of their dynamical history (that is, they may
have different dynamical ages). Blue straggler stars have masses greater than
those at the turn-off point on the main sequence and therefore must be the
result of either a collision or a mass-transfer event. Because they are among
the most massive and luminous objects in old clusters, they can be used as test
particles with which to probe dynamical evolution. Here we report that globular
clusters can be grouped into a few distinct families on the basis of the radial
distribution of blue stragglers. This grouping corresponds well to an effective
ranking of the dynamical stage reached by stellar systems, thereby permitting a
direct measure of the cluster dynamical age purely from observed properties.

extremely powerful tool for the investigation of the internal structure and

oscillations from helioseismology experiments on Earth and in space have shown,
for example, that the Sun's shape varies over solar cycle timescales. In
particular, far-reaching inferences about the Sun have been obtained by
applying inversion techniques to observations of frequencies of oscillations.
The results, so far, have shown that the solar structure is remarkably close to
the predictions of the standard solar model and, recently, that the
near-surface region can be probed with sufficiently high spatial resolution as
to allow investigations of the equation of state and of the solar envelope
helium abundance. The same helioseismic inversion methods can be applied to the
rotational frequency splittings to deduce with high accuracy the internal
rotation velocity of the Sun, as function of radius and latitude. This also
allows us to study some global astrophysical properties of the Sun, such as the
angular momentum, the grativational quadrupole moment and the effect of
distortion induced on the surface (oblateness). The helioseismic approach and
what we have learnt from it during the last decades about the interior of the

Appropriate priors are chosen for the functions which together determine this

about the forward model. Having done this, we illustrate how Maximum Likelihood

also how we can apply recently developed \SLC{Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)}
methods on function spaces to characterise the whole of the posterior density.

distribution is multimodal and irregular, leading us to the conclusion that
knowledge of a state of global maximal posterior density does not always give
us the whole picture, and full posterior sampling can give better

equations of the spherical collapse are those obtained in Pace et al. (2010),

density contrast derived from Newtonian hydrodynamics, and assumed that dark
energy is present only at the background level. With the introduction of the

perturbations on galactic scale giving rise to higher values of the linear
overdensity parameter with respect to the non-rotating case. We find a similar

5 GeV is presented. The dataset includes the recent high-precision TOTEM
measurements of the $pp$ total and elastic (integrated) cross-sections at 7 TeV
and 8 TeV. Following previous works, the leading high-energy contribution for
the total cross-section ($\sigma_{tot}$) is parametrized as
$\ln^{\gamma}(s/s_h)$, where $\gamma$ and $s_h$ are free \textit{real} fit
parameters. Singly-subtracted derivative dispersion relations are used to
connect $\sigma_{tot}$ and the rho parameter ($\rho$) in an analytical way.
Different fit procedures are considered, including individual fits to
$\sigma_{tot}$ data, global fits to $\sigma_{tot}$ and $\rho$ data, constrained
and unconstrained data reductions. The results favor a rise of the
$\sigma_{tot}$ faster than the log-squared bound by Froissart and Martin at the
LHC energy region. The parametrization for $\sigma_{tot}$ is extended to fit
the elastic cross-section ($\sigma_{el}$) data with satisfactory results. The
analysis indicates an asymptotic ratio $\sigma_{el}/\sigma_{tot}$ consistent
with 1/3 (as already obtained in a previous work). A critical discussion on the
correlation, practical role and physical implications of the parameters
$\gamma$ and $s_h$ is presented. The discussion confronts the 2002 prediction
of $\sigma_{tot}$ by the COMPETE Collaboration and the recent result by the
Particle Data Group (2012 edition of the Review of Particle Physics). Some
conjectures on possible implications of a fast rise of the proton-proton total
cross-section at the highest energies are also presented.

total work to be bounded in terms of the output complexity, yielding the output

systematic method to find over which range (if any) a certain distribution

sense that true (simulated) power-law tails are not recognized as such in some
instances, and then the power-law hypothesis is rejected. Moreover, the method
does not work well when extended to power-law distributions with an upper
truncation. We explain in detail a similar but alternative procedure, valid for

maximum likelihood estimation, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test, and
Monte Carlo simulations. An overview of the main concepts as well as a recipe

the two-dimensional complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with cubic and quintic
nonlinearities. We start from the parameters used by Akhmediev {\it et. al.}
and slowly vary them one by one to determine the regimes where solitons exist
as stable/unstable structures. We present eight classes of dissipative solitons
from which six are known (stationary, pulsating, vortex spinning, filament,
exploding, creeping) and two are novel (creeping-vortex propellers and spinning
""bean-shaped"" solitons). By running lengthy simulations for the different
parameters of the equation, we find ranges of existence of stable structures
(stationary, pulsating, circular vortex spinning, organized exploding), and
unstable structures (elliptic vortex spinning that leads to filament,
disorganized exploding, creeping). Moreover, by varying even the two initial
conditions together with vorticity, we find a richer behavior in the form of
creeping-vortex propellers, and spinning ""bean-shaped"" solitons. Each class
differentiates from the other by distinctive features of their energy
evolution, shape of initial conditions, as well as domain of existence of
parameters.

approximation to comprehensively investigate periodic and solitary wave
solutions of the modified Benjamin, Bona & Mahony equation (BBM) to include
both dissipative and dispersive effects of viscous boundary layers. Under
certain circumstances that depend on the traveling wave velocity, classes of
periodic and solitary wave like solutions are obtained in terms of Jacobi
elliptic functions. An ad-hoc theory based on the dissipative term is
presented, in which we have found a set of solutions in terms of an implicit
function. Using dynamical systems theory we prove that the solutions of
\eqref{BBMv} experience a transcritical bifurcation for a certain velocity of
the traveling wave. Finally, we present qualitative numerical results.

the steady-states of the traveling wave ODEs of the cubic-quintic
Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE). These correspond to plane waves of the PDE. In
addition to the most general situation, we also derive the degeneracy
conditions on the eight coefficients of the CGLE under which the equation for
the steady states assumes each of the possible quartic (the quartic fold and an
unnamed form), cubic (the pitchfork and the winged cusp), and quadratic (four
possible cases) normal forms for singularities of codimension up to three.
Since the actual governing equations are employed, all results are globally
valid, and not just of local applicability. In each case, the recognition
problem for the unfolded singularity is treated. The transition varieties, i.e.
the hysteresis, isola, and double limit curves are presented for each normal
form. For both the most general case, as well as for various combinations of
coefficients relevant to the particular cases, the bifurcations curves are
mapped out in the various regions of parameter space delimited by these
varieties. The multiplicities and interactions of the plane wave solutions are
then comprehensively deduced from the bifurcation plots in each regime, and
include features such as regimes of hysteresis among co-existing states,
domains featuring more than one interval of hysteresis, and isola behavior
featuring dynamics unrelated to the primary solution branch in limited ranges
of parameter space.

two-component reaction-diffusion equations are considered. The stability of the
fixed points of the traveling wave ODEs (in the usual ""spatial"" variable) is
considered. For general functional forms of the nonlinear prey birthrate/prey
deathrate or reaction terms, a Hopf bifurcation is shown to occur at two
different critical values of the traveling wave speed. The post-bifurcation
dynamics is investigated for five different functional forms of the
nonlinearities. In cases where the bifurcation is supercritical, the
post-bifurcation behaviour yields stable periodic orbits of the traveling-wave
ODEs in the spatial variable. These correspond to stable periodic wavetrains of
the full PDEs. Subcritical Hopf bifurcations yield more complex
post-bifurcation dynamics in the PDE wavetrains. In special cases where the
subcritical bifurcation marks the end of the regime of stability, the
post-bifurcation behavior in the spatial ODEs is chaotic, corresponding to
wavetrains of the original PDEs which are spatially coherent, but have chaotic
temporal dynamics. All the models are integrated numerically to investigate the
post-bifurcation dynamics and chaotic regimes are characterized by computing
power spectra, autocorrelation functions, and fractal dimensions.
