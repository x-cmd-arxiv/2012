The solutions to the former provide effective potentials and coupling matrix
elements that enter into the latter set of equations. This paper develops a
theoretical framework to determine the effective potentials, as well as the
associated coupling matrix elements, for few-body systems with finite angular

redistribute, in the pupil plane, the energy collected by the telescope. Most
of the on-axis light must ideally be rejected outside the aperture to be
blocked with a Lyot stop, while almost all off-axis light must go through it.
The unobstructed circular apertures of off-axis telescopes make this possible
but all major telescopes are however on-axis and the performance of these
coronagraphs is dramatically reduced by the central obstruction. Their
performance can be restored by using an additional optimally designed apodizer
that changes the amplitude in the first pupil plane so that the on-axis light
is rejected outside the obstructed aperture of the telescope. The numerical
optimization model is built by maximizing the apodizer's transmission while
setting constraints on the extremum values of the electric field that the Lyot
stop does not block. The coronagraphic image is compared to what a non-apodized
phase mask coronagraph provides and an analysis is made of the trade-offs that
exist between the apodizer transmission and the Lyot stop properties. The
existence of a solution and the mask transmission depend on the aperture and
the Lyot stop geometries, and on the constraints that are set on the on-axis
attenuation. The system throughput is a concave function of the Lyot stop
transmission. In the case of a VLT-like aperture, apodizers with a transmission
of 0.16 to 0.92 associated with a four-quadrant phase mask provide contrast as
low as a few 1e-10 at 1 lambda/D from the star. The system's maximum throughput
is 0.64, for an apodizer with an 0.88 transmission and a Lyot stop with a 0.69
transmission. Optimizing apodizers for a vortex phase mask requires computation
times much longer than in the previous case, and no result is presented for

century. This system has one of the longest orbital periods known (13.5yr) and
was initially classified as a zet_Aur-type variable. It was then forgotten for
decades.
  This study provides a detailed look at the V383Sco, using new data obtained
around the last eclipse in 2007/8. There was a suspicion that this system could
be similar to eclipsing systems with extensive dusty disks like EECep and
eps_Aur. This and other, alternative hypotheses are considered.
  The ASAS-3 VI light curves have been used to examine photometric changes.
Low-(LRS) and high-res.(HRS) spectra have been used for spectral
classification, to analyse line profiles, as well as to determine the
reddening, radial velocities (RVs) and distance. The SED was analysed. Using
original numerical code, we performed a simplified model of the eclipse, taking
into account the pulsations of one of the components.
  The LRS shows traces of molecular bands, characteristic of an M-type
supergiant. The presence of this star in the system is confirmed by SED, by a
strong dependence of the eclipse depth on the photometric bands, and by
pulsational changes. The presence of a low excitation nebula around the system
has been inferred from [OI] 6300A emission. Analysis of the RVs, reddening, and
P-L relation for Mira-type stars imply a distance to the V383Sco of 8.4+-0.6
kpc. The distance to the nearby V381Sco is 6.4+-0.8 kpc. The very different and
oppositely directed RVs of these systems (89.8 vs -178.8 km/s) seem to be in

(CR) networks composed of multiple primary users (PUs) and secondary users
(SUs) wherein each SU (player) competes against the others to maximize his own
opportunistic throughput by choosing jointly the sensing duration, the
detection thresholds, and the vector power allocation over a multichannel link.
In addition to power budget constraints, several (deterministic or
probabilistic) interference constraints can be accommodated in the proposed
general formulation, such as constraints on the maximum individual/aggregate
(probabilistic) interference tolerable from the PUs. To keep the optimization
as decentralized as possible, global interference constraints, when present,
are imposed via pricing; the prices are thus additional variables to be
optimized. The resulting players' optimization problems are nonconvex and there
are price clearance conditions associated with the nonconvex global
interference constraints to be satisfied by the equilibria of the game, which
make the analysis of the proposed game a challenging task; none of classical
results in the game theory literature can be successfully applied. To deal with
the nonconvexity of the game, we introduce a relaxed equilibrium concept, the
Quasi-Nash Equilibrium (QNE), and study its main properties, performance, and
connection with local Nash equilibria. Quite interestingly, the proposed game
theoretical formulations yield a considerable performance improvement with
respect to current centralized and decentralized designs of CR systems, which
validates the concept of QNE.

significantly improve on the $L_1$ method and yield sparser models with better

censored, missing or otherwise incomplete information. For example, the popular
fixed rank nomination (FRN) scheme, often used in studies of schools and
businesses, asks study participants to nominate and rank at most a small number
of contacts or friends, leaving the existence other relations uncertain.
However, most statistical models are formulated in terms of completely observed
binary networks. Statistical analyses of FRN data with such models ignore the
censored and ranked nature of the data and could potentially result in
misleading statistical inference. To investigate this possibility, we compare
parameter estimates obtained from a likelihood for complete binary networks to
those from a likelihood that is derived from the FRN scheme, and therefore
recognizes the ranked and censored nature of the data. We show analytically and
via simulation that the binary likelihood can provide misleading inference, at
least for certain model parameters that relate network ties to characteristics
of individuals and pairs of individuals. We also compare these different
likelihoods in a data analysis of several adolescent social networks. For some
of these networks, the parameter estimates from the binary and FRN likelihoods
lead to different conclusions, indicating the importance of analyzing FRN data
with a method that accounts for the FRN survey design.

we allow the optimization variables of the players to be matrices in the

whose convergence analysis is based on Variational Inequality (VI) techniques,
can select, among all the equilibria of a game, those that optimize a given
performance criterion, at the cost of limited signaling among the players. This
is a major departure from existing best-response algorithms, whose convergence
conditions imply the uniqueness of the NE. Some of our results hinge on the use
of VI problems directly in the complex domain; the study of these new kind of
VIs also represents a noteworthy innovative contribution. We then apply the
developed methods to solve some new generalizations of SISO and MIMO games in
cognitive radios and femtocell systems, showing a considerable performance

  Residuals",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaussian Process (GP) regression models typically assume that residuals are
Gaussian and have the same variance for all observations. However, applications
with input-dependent noise (heteroscedastic residuals) frequently arise in
practice, as do applications in which the residuals do not have a Gaussian
distribution. In this paper, we propose a GP Regression model with a latent
variable that serves as an additional unobserved covariate for the regression.
This model (which we call GPLC) allows for heteroscedasticity since it allows
the function to have a changing partial derivative with respect to this
unobserved covariate. With a suitable covariance function, our GPLC model can
handle (a) Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance, or (b)
non-Gaussian residuals with input-dependent variance, or (c) Gaussian residuals
with constant variance. We compare our model, using synthetic datasets, with a
model proposed by Goldberg, Williams and Bishop (1998), which we refer to as
GPLV, which only deals with case (a), as well as a standard GP model which can
handle only case (c). Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods are developed for both
modelsl. Experiments show that when the data is heteroscedastic, both GPLC and
GPLV give better results (smaller mean squared error and negative
log-probability density) than standard GP regression. In addition, when the
residual are Gaussian, our GPLC model is generally nearly as good as GPLV,
while when the residuals are non-Gaussian, our GPLC model is better than GPLV.

experimentally. The band structure of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene consists of
a monolayer-like and a bilayer-like pairs of bands. Here we study electronic
properties of ABA-stacked trilayer graphene biased by a perpendicular electric
field. We find that the combination of the bias and trigonal warping gives rise
to a set of new Dirac points: in each valley, seven species of Dirac fermions
with small masses of order of a few meV emerge. The positions and masses of the
emergent Dirac fermions are tunable by bias, and one group of Dirac fermions
becomes massless at a certain bias value. Therefore, in contrast to bilayer
graphene, the conductivity at the neutrality point is expected to show
non-monotonic behavior, becoming of the order of a few e^2/h when some Dirac
masses vanish. Further, we analyze the evolution of Landau level spectrum as a
function of bias. Emergence of new Dirac points in the band structure
translates into new three-fold-degenerate groups of Landau levels. This leads
to an anomalous quantum Hall effect, in which some quantum Hall steps have a
height of 3e^2/h. At an intermediate bias, the degeneracies of all Landau
levels get lifted, and in this regime all quantum Hall plateaus are spaced by
e^2/h. Finally, we show that the pattern of Landau level crossings is very
sensitive to certain band structure parameters, and can therefore provide a
useful tool for determining their precise values.

lattice $Z^d$, with a particular interest in describing the behavior when one
species initially occupies the exterior of a cone. First-passage competition is
a stochastic process modeling two infections spreading outward from initially
occupied disjoint subsets of $Z^d$. Each infecting species transmits its
infection at random times from previously infected sites to neighboring
uninfected sites. The infection times are governed by species-specific
probability distributions, and every vertex of $Z^d$ remains permanently
infected by whichever species infects it first.
  We introduce a new, simple construction of first-passage competition that
works for an arbitrary pair of disjoint starting sets in $Z^d$, and we
analogously define a deterministic first-passage competition process in the
Euclidean space $R^d$, providing a formal definition for a model of crystal
growth that has previously been studied computationally. We then prove large
deviations estimates for the random $Z^d$-process, showing that on large scales
it is well-approximated by the deterministic $R^d$-process, with high
probability. Analyzing the geometry of the deterministic process allows us to
identify critical phenomena in the random process when one of the two species
initially occupies the entire exterior of a cone and the other species
initially occupies a single interior site. Our results generalize those in a
2007 paper of Deijfen and H\""aggstr\""om, who considered the case where the cone
is a half-space. Moreover, we use our results about competition in cones to
strengthen a 2000 result of H\""aggstr\""om and Pemantle about competition from

(SN Ia) spectra. We focus on the feature at ~3500 - 4000 A, which is commonly
thought to be caused by blueshifted absorption of Ca H&K. Unlike some other
spectral features in SN Ia spectra, this feature often has two overlapping
(blue and red) components. It is accepted that the red component comes from
photospheric calcium. However, it has been proposed that the blue component is
caused by either high-velocity calcium (from either abundance or density
enhancements above the photosphere of the SN) or Si II 3858. By looking at
multiple data sets and model spectra, we conclude that the blue component of
the Ca H&K feature is caused by Si II 3858 for most SNe Ia. The strength of the
Si II 3858 feature varies strongly with the light-curve shape of a SN. As a
result, the velocity measured from a single-Gaussian fit to the full line
profile correlates with light-curve shape. The velocity of the Ca H&K component
of the profile does not correlate with light-curve shape, contrary to previous
claims. We detail the pitfalls of assuming that the blue component of the Ca

that cause spin precession. The skew scattering and side-jump scattering terms
in the SHE vanish, but we identify two additional terms in the SHE, due to
r_so, which have not been considered in the literature so far. One term
reflects the modification of the spin precession due to the action of the
external electric field (the field drives the current in the quantum well),
which produces, via r_so, an effective magnetic field perpendicular to the
plane of the quantum well. The other term reflects a similar modification of
the spin precession due to the action of the electric field created by random
impurities, and appears in a careful formulation of the Born approximation. We
refer to these two effects collectively as anomalous spin precession and we
note that they contribute to the SHE to the first order in the SO coupling
constant even though they formally appear to be of second order. In electron
systems with weak momentum scattering, the contribution of the anomalous spin
precession due to the external electric field equals 1/2 the usual side-jump
SHE, while the additional impurity-dependent contribution depends on the form
of the band structure SO coupling. For band structure SO linear in wave vector
the two additional contributions cancel. For band structure SO cubic in wave
vector only the contribution due to external electric field is present, and can

cosmic microwave background (CMB) from the recent SPT-SZ survey, along with
data from WMAP7 and measurements of $H_0$ and BAO. We check for consistency
within $\Lambda$CDM between these datasets, and find some tension. The CMB
alone gives weak support to physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, due to a slight trend
relative to $\Lambda$CDM of decreasing power towards smaller angular scales.
While it may be due to statistical fluctuation, this trend could also be
explained by several extensions. We consider running index (nrun), as well as
two extensions that modify the damping tail power (the primordial helium
abundance $Y_p$ and the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$) and
one that modifies the large-scale power due to the ISW effect (the sum of
neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$). These extensions have similar observational
consequences and are partially degenerate when considered simultaneously. Of
the 6 one-parameter extensions considered, we find CMB to have the largest
preference for nrun with -0.046<nrun<-0.003 at 95% confidence, which
strengthens to a 2.7$\sigma$ indication of nrun<0 from CMB+BAO+$H_0$.
Detectable non-zero nrun is difficult to explain in the context of
single-field, slow-roll inflation models. We find $N_{\rm eff}=3.62\pm0.48$ for
the CMB, which tightens to $N_{\rm eff}=3.71\pm0.35$ from CMB+BAO+$H_0$. Larger
values of $N_{\rm eff}$ relieve the mild tension between CMB, BAO and $H_0$.
When the SZ selected galaxy cluster abundances ($\rm{SPT_{CL}}$) data are also
included, we obtain $N_{\rm eff}=3.29\pm0.31$. Allowing for $\sum m_\nu$ gives
a 3$\sigma$ detection of $\sum m_\nu$>0 from CMB+BAO+$H_0$+$\rm{SPT_{CL}}$. The
median value is $(0.32\pm0.11)$ eV, a factor of six above the lower bound set
by neutrino oscillation observations. ... [abridged]

neural networks which a recurrent part (the reservoir) that does not

recurrence (no neural circuit) occurs. This approach has grown rapidly due to
its success in solving learning tasks and other computational applications.
Some success was also observed with another recently proposed neural network

ESNs where the reservoir has a new dynamics inspired by recurrent RandNNs. The

spherical colloidal particles to illustrate many of the implications of the
Random First Order Transition (RFOT) theory (PRA 40 1045 (1989)), which is the
only theory that provides a unified description of both the statics and
dynamics of the liquid to glass transition. In accord with the RFOT, we find
that as the volume fraction of the colloidal particles \f, the natural variable
that controls glass formation in colloidal systems, approaches \f_A there is an
effective ergodic to non-ergodic dynamical transition, which is signalled by a
dramatic slowing down of diffusion. In addition, using the energy metric we
show that the system becomes non-ergodic as \f_A is approached. The time t^*,
at which the four-point dynamical susceptibility achieves a maximum, also
diverges near \f_A. Remarkably, three independent measures(translational
diffusion coefficients, ergodic diffusion coefficients,as well t^*) all signal
that at \f_A=0.1 ergodicity is effectively broken. The translation diffusion
constant, the ergodic diffusion constant, and (t^*)^-1 all vanish as
(\f_A-\f)^g with both \f_A and g being the roughly the same for all three
quantities. Below \f_A transport involves crossing suitable free energy
barriers. In this regime, the density-density correlation function decays as a
stretched exponential exp(-t/tau_a)^b with b=0.45. The \f-dependence of the
relaxation time \tau_a is well fit using the VFT law with the ideal glass
transition occurring at \f_K=0.47. By using an approximate measure of the local
entropy (s_3) we show that below \f_A the law of large numbers, which states
that the distribution of s_3 for a large subsample should be identical to the
whole sample, is not obeyed. The comprehensive analyses provided here for
Wigner glass forming charged colloidal suspensions fully validate the concepts
of the RFOT.

splitting, emergence, and cancellation, by using an auto-detection technique.
We find that merging and splitting are locally predominant in the surface
level, while the frequencies of the other two are less by one or two orders of
magnitude. The frequency dependences on flux con- tent of surface processes are
further investigated. Based on these observations, we discuss a possible whole
picture of the maintenance. Our conclusion is that the photospheric magnetic
field structure, especially its power-law nature, is maintained by the
processes locally in the surface not by the interactions between different
altitudes. We suggest a scenario of the flux maintenance as follows: The
splitting and merging play a crucial role for the generation of the power-law
distribution, not the emergence nor cancellation do. This power-law
distribution results in another power-law one of the cancellation with an idea
of the random convective transport. The cancellation and emergence have a
common value for the power-law indices in their frequency distributions, which
may suggest a ""recycle of fluxes by submergence and re-emergence"".

from severe SM background at the LHC even in associated productions $Wh_{\rm

requires more data to reduce its large error bar. We investigate the
possibility of this channel with largest uncertainty not dominating the decay
of Higgs-like boson discovered at the LHC. In such scenarios, the Higgs signal
shows highly suppressed $b\bar{b}$, slightly reduced $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ and
moderately enhanced gauge bosons comparing with the SM predictions. The model
requires two different sources of electroweak symmetry breaking and radiative
correction to $m_{b}$ strongly enhanced. However, large reduction in $b\bar{b}$
usually results large enhancement in $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ mode in particular. The
reduction of $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ therefore implies that a new decay mode is
inevitable. We find that a non-decoupling MSSM Higgs decay into lighter Higgs
$H\to hh$ may fit the signature. Here, MSSM $H$ is identified as the 126 GeV
resonance while $h$ is below $M_{H}/2$ and can evade the direct search bound at
LEPII and Tevatron. Large $PQ$ and $R$ symmetry breaking effects mediated by
strong interaction can strongly enhance radiative corrections in $m_b$.
However, the scenario can only be realized in highly fine-tuned parameter
region where $G_{Hhh}$ is tiny. Nevertheless, we discuss the discovery
potential of this highly fine-tuned $H\to hh$ at the LHC.

be fairly uniform in a marginally supersolar level such like the case of Fe:
<[C/H]> = +0.15 (sigma = 0.08), <[O/H]> = +0.22 (sigma = 0.14), and <[Fe/H]> =
+0.11(sigma = 0.08), suggesting that the primordial abundances are almost
retained for these elements. Strictly, however, they show a slightly increasing
trend with a decrease in T_eff (typically on the order of ~10^(-4) dex/K; while
this might be due to an improper choice of atmospheric parameters, we found it
hard to give a quantitatively reasonable explanation. Regarding Li, we
confirmed the well-known T_eff-dependent trend in the Li abundance reported so
far (a conspicuous Li-trough at 6300K <T_eff< 6700K and a progressive decrease
toward a lower T_eff at T_eff < 6000K), which means that the surface Li of
Hyades stars is essentially controlled only by T_eff and other parameters such
as the rotational velocity are almost irrelevant.

recently been proposed and implemented. Under these new DSN architectures, no
single party possesses the full knowledge of the entire social network. While
this approach solves the above problems, the lack of global knowledge for the
DSN nodes makes it much more challenging to support some common but critical
SNS services like friends discovery and community detection. In this paper, we
tackle the problem of community detection for a given user under the constraint
of limited local topology information as imposed by common DSN architectures.
By considering the Personalized Page Rank (PPR) approach as an ink spilling
process, we justify its applicability for decentralized community detection
using limited local topology information.Our proposed PPR-based solution has a
wide range of applications such as friends recommendation, targeted
advertisement, automated social relationship labeling and sybil defense. Using
data collected from a large-scale SNS in practice, we demonstrate our adapted
version of PPR can significantly outperform the basic PR as well as two other
commonly used heuristics. The inclusion of a few manually labeled friends in
the Escape Vector (EV) can boost the performance considerably (64.97% relative

novel biological insights. To this end, we adopt a simplified model that is
suitable for capturing the essence of a large class of gene regulatory
networks. It is first shown that local instability of the unique equilibrium
state results in oscillations based on a Poincare-Bendixson type theorem. Then,
a graphical existence condition, which is equivalent to the local instability
of a unique equilibrium, is derived. Based on the graphical condition, the
existence condition is analytically presented in terms of biochemical
parameters. This allows us to find the dimensionless parameters that primarily
affect the existence of oscillations, and to provide biological insights. The
analytic conditions and biological insights are illustrated with two existing

range. Based on the model, it can be concluded that the exponential law of
distance distribution is attributed to decreasing exponentially of average

only depends on urban planning, population distribution, regional functions and
so on, it illustrates that these inherent properties of cities are impetus to

materials science. Running MD on a graphics processing unit (GPU) is an
attractive new approach for accelerating MD simulations. Currently, GPU
implementations of MD usually run in a one-host-process-one-GPU (OHPOG) scheme.
This scheme may pose a limitation on the system size that an implementation can
handle due to the small device memory relative to the host memory. In this
paper, we present a one-host-process-multiple-GPU (OHPMG) implementation of MD
with embedded-atom-model or semi-empirical tight-binding many-body potentials.
Because more device memory is available in an OHPMG process, the system size
that can be handled is increased to a few million or more atoms. In comparison
with the CPU implementation, in which Newton's third law is applied to improve
the computational efficiency, our OHPMG implementation has achieved a
28.9x~86.0x speedup in double precision, depending on the system size, the
cut-off ranges and the number of GPUs. The implementation can also handle a
group of small boxes in one run by combining the small boxes into a large box.
This approach greatly improves the GPU computing efficiency when a large number
of MD simulations for small boxes are needed for statistical purposes.

of ions or neutral atoms, internal population control and state preparation
(for nuclear magnetic resonance or quantum information), cold atom expansions

strength of inter-individual interactions is a key-information. In an approach
based on statistical physics one needs to know the interaction Hamiltonian. For
non-physical systems, based on qualitative arguments similar to those used in
physical chemistry, interaction strength gives useful clues about the
macroscopic properties of the system. Even though our ultimate objective is the
understanding of social phenomena, we found that systems composed of insects
(or other living organisms) are of great convenience for investigating group
effects. In this paper we show how to design experiments that enable us to
estimate the strength of interaction in groups of insects. By repeating the
same experiments with increasing numbers of insects, ranging from less than 10
to several hundreds, one is able to explore key-properties of the interaction.
The data turn out to be consistent with a global correlation that is
independent of distance (at least within a range of a few centimetres).
Estimates of this average cross-correlation will be given for ants, beetles and
fruit flies. The experimental results clearly exclude an Ising-like
interaction, that is to say one that would be restricted to nearest neighbours.
In the case of fruit flies the average cross-correlation appears to be negative
which means that instead of an inter-individual attraction there is a (weak)
repulsive effect. In our conclusion we insist on the fact that such
""physics-like experiments"" on insect populations provide a valuable alternative
to computer simulations. When testable group effects are predicted by a model,
the required experiments can be set up, thus permitting to confirm or disprove
the model.

continuously from time to time. In this paper we have reviewed a relatively new
or unexplored topic of Live OS. From networking perspective, Live OS is used
for establishing Clusters, Firewalls and as Network security assessment tool
etc. Our proposed concept is that a Live OS can be established or configured
for an organizations specific network requirements with respect to their
servers. An important server failure due to hardware or software could take
time for remedy of the problem, so for that situation a preconfigured server in
the form of Live OS on CD/DVD/USB can be used as an immediate solution. In a
network of ten nodes, we stopped the server machine and with necessary
adjustments, Live OS replaced the server in less than five minutes. Live OS in
a network environment is a quick replacement of the services that are failed
due to server failure (hardware or software). It is a cost effective solution
for low budget networks. The life of Live OS starts when we boot it from
CD/DVD/USB and remains in action for that session. As soon as the machine is
rebooted, any work done for that session is gone, (in case we do not store any
information on permanent storage media). Live CD/DVD/USB is normally used on
systems where we do not have Operating Systems installed. A Live OS can also be
used on systems where we already have an installed OS. On the basis of
functionality a Live OS can be used for many purposes and has some typical
advantages that are not available on other operating systems. Vendors are
releasing different distributions of Live OS and is becoming their sole
identity in a particular domain like Networks, Security, Education or
Entertainment etc. There can be many aspects of Live OS, but Linux based Live
OS and their use in the field of networks is the main focus of this paper.

of a deterministic and a stochastic dynamical part. Such a stochastic process
can be reconstructed by means of a recently introduced nonparametric method,
thus increasing the predictability, i.e. knowledge of the macroscopic drift and
the microscopic diffusion functions. If the measurement of a stochastic process
is affected by additional strong measurement noise, the reconstruction process
cannot be applied. Here, we present a method for the reconstruction of
stochastic processes in the presence of strong measurement noise, based on a
suitably parametrized ansatz. At the core of the process is the minimization of
the functional distance between terms containing the conditional moments taken
from measurement data, and the corresponding ansatz functions. It is shown that
a minimization of the distance by means of a simulated annealing procedure
yields better results than a previously used Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm,
which permits a rapid and reliable reconstruction of the stochastic process.

collected distributions characterizing average times of the dimer and trimer

temperature and pH. As one can expect, an increase of the temperature decreases
an uranyl capability of forming the associates, thus lowering bound
fractions/times and vice versa. The effect of pH was modeled by adding H^+ or
OH^- ions to a ""neutral"" solution. The addition of hydroxide ions OH^- favors
the formation of the associates, thus increasing bound times and fractions. The
extra H^+ ions in a solution produce an opposite effect, thus lowering the

The C IV emission peaks at 42 AU from the stellar position and has a FWHM of 52
AU along the jet. Its deprojected velocity of around 200 km/s decreases
monotonically away from the driving source. In addition, we compare our HST
data with the X-ray emission from the DG Tau jet. We investigate the
requirements to explain the data by an initially hot jet compared to local
heating. Both scenarios indicate a mass loss by the T~1e5 K jet of ~1e-9

the framework of 1D Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. The
effects of pressure fluctuations are more important in the red giant model,
owing to larger stratification of the convective zone. We show how this impacts
different terms in the mean-field equations. We clarify the driving sources of
kinetic energy, and show that the rate of turbulent dissipation is comparable
to the convective luminosity. Although our flows have low Mach number and are
nearly adiabatic, our analysis is general and can be applied to photospheric
convection as well. The robustness of our analysis of turbulent convection is
supported by the insensitivity of the mean-field balances to linear mesh
resolution. We find robust results for the turbulent convection zone and the
stable layers in the oxygen-burning shell model, and robust results everywhere
in the red giant model, but the mean fields are not well converged in the
narrow boundary regions (which contain steep gradients) in the oxygen-burning

local elastic deformation tensor ${\mathsf D}$ as well as a positive definite
scalar $\chi$ measuring non-affinity, i.e. the extent to which the
displacements are not representable as affine deformations of a reference
crystal. We perform an exact calculation of the statistics of $\chi$ and
${\mathsf D}$ and their spatial correlations for solids at low temperatures,
within a harmonic approximation and in one and two dimensions. We obtain the
joint distribution $P(\chi, {\mathsf D})$ and the two point spatial correlation
functions for $\chi$ and ${\mathsf D}$. We show that non-affine and affine
deformations are coupled even in a harmonic solid, with a strength that depends
on the size of the coarse graining volume $\Omega$ and dimensionality. As a
corollary to our work, we identify the field, $h_{\chi}$, conjugate to $\chi$
and show that this field may be tuned to produce a transition to a state where
the ensemble average, $<\chi>$, and the correlation length of $\chi$ diverge.
Our work should be useful as a template for understanding non-affine
displacements in realistic systems with or without disorder and as a means for
developing computational tools for studying the effects of non-affine
displacements in melting, plastic flow and the glass transition.

disk-integrated spectra of the Earth with future application to Earth-analogs
in mind, concentrating on the diurnal timescale. We first analyze observations
of the Earth provided by the EPOXI mission, and find 5-20% fractional variation
of the absorption depths of H2O and O2 bands, two molecules that have major
signatures in the observed range. From a correlation analysis with the cloud
map data from the Earth Observing Satellite (EOS), we find that their variation
pattern is primarily due to the uneven cloud cover distribution. In order to
account for the observed variation quantitatively, we consider a simple opaque
cloud model, which assumes that the clouds totally block the spectral influence
of the atmosphere below the cloud layer, equivalent to assuming that the
incident light is completely scattered at the cloud top level. The model is
reasonably successful, and reproduces the EPOXI data from the pixel-level EOS
cloud/water vapor data. A difference in the diurnal variability patterns of H2O
and O2 bands is ascribed to the differing vertical and horizontal distribution
of those molecular species in the atmosphere. On the Earth, the inhomogeneous
distribution of atmospheric water vapor is due to the existence of its exchange
with liquid and solid phases of H2O on the planet's surface on a timescale
short compared to atmospheric mixing times. If such differences in variability
patterns were detected in spectra of Earth-analogs, it would provide the
information on the inhomogeneous composition of their atmospheres.

These systems produce such huge amounts of event data that existing systems are
unable to store and process them. Moreover, few processes are in steady-state
and due to changing circumstances processes evolve and systems need to adapt
continuously. Since conventional process discovery algorithms have been defined
for batch processing, it is difficult to apply them in such evolving
environments. Existing algorithms cannot cope with streaming event data and
tend to generate unreliable and obsolete results.
  In this paper, we discuss the peculiarities of dealing with streaming event
data in the context of process mining. Subsequently, we present a general
framework for defining process mining algorithms in settings where it is
impossible to store all events over an extended period or where processes
evolve while being analyzed. We show how the Heuristics Miner, one of the most
effective process discovery algorithms for practical applications, can be
modified using this framework. Different stream-aware versions of the
Heuristics Miner are defined and implemented in ProM. Moreover, experimental
results on artificial and real logs are reported.
