atmosphere dominated by convective motions and the upper atmosphere dominated
by wave activity. Convective motions form a prominent granulation pattern with
an intensity contrast (~18%) which is larger than in the solar models (~15%).
The upper atmosphere is frequently traversed by fast shock waves, with vertical
and horizontal velocities of up to Mach ~2.5 and ~6.0, respectively. The
typical diameter of the granules amounts to ~5Gm which translates into ~400
granules covering the whole stellar surface. The turbulent pressure in the

pressure which shows that it cannot be neglected in stellar atmosphere and
evolutionary modeling. However, there exists no combination of the
mixing-length parameter and turbulent pressure that would allow to
satisfactorily reproduce the 3D temperature-pressure profile with 1D atmosphere

evolutionary processes can sometimes favour gene tree topologies that conflict
with an underlying species tree. In the case of incomplete lineage sorting,
this phenomenon has recently been well-studied, and some elegant solutions for
species tree reconstruction have been proposed. One particularly simple and
statistically consistent estimator of the species tree under incomplete lineage
sorting is to combine three-taxon analyses, which are phylogenetically robust
to incomplete lineage sorting. In this paper, we consider whether such an
approach will also work under lateral gene transfer (LGT). By providing an
exact analysis of some cases of this model, we show that there is a zone of
inconsistency for triplet-based species tree reconstruction under LGT. However,
a triplet-based approach will consistently reconstruct a species tree under
models of LGT, provided that the expected number of LGT transfers is not too
high. Our analysis involves a novel connection between the LGT problem and
random walks on cyclic graphs. We have implemented a procedure for
reconstructing trees subject to LGT or lineage sorting in settings where taxon
coverage may be patchy and illustrate its use on two sample data sets.

[M/H]=0.0). We used two types of model atmospheres, 3D hydrodynamical and
classical 1D, calculated with the CO5BOLD and LHD stellar atmosphere codes,
respectively. Both codes share the same atmospheric parameters, chemical
composition, equation of state, and opacities, which allowed us to make a
strictly differential comparison between the line formation properties
predicted in 3D and 1D. The influence of convection on the spectral line
formation was assessed with the aid of 3D-1D abundance corrections, which
measure the difference between the abundances of chemical species derived with
the 3D hydrodynamical and 1D classical model atmospheres. We find that
convection plays a significant role in the spectral line formation in this
particular red giant. The derived 3D-1D abundance corrections rarely exceed
\pm0.1 dex when lines of neutral atoms and molecules are considered, which is
in line with the previous findings for solar-metallicity red giants located on
the lower RGB. The situation is different with lines that belong to ionized
atoms, or to neutral atoms with high ionization potential. In both cases, the
corrections for high-excitation lines (\chi>8 eV) may amount to \Delta_3D-1D ~
-0.4 dex. The 3D--1D abundance corrections generally show a significant
wavelength dependence; in most cases they are smaller in the near-infrared, at

contributions to the quark mass gap. The gap does not grow arbitrarily,
however, for models of asymptotic free interactions. For B -> infinity, the
magnetic field decouples from the dimensionally reduced self-consistent
equations, so that the gap behaves as ~ Lambda_QCD (or less), instead of ~
|eB|^{1/2}. On the other hand, the number of participants to the chiral
condensate keeps increasing as ~ |eB| so that |<\bar{\psi} \psi>| ~ |eB|
Lambda_QCD. After the mass gap stops developing, nothing tempers the growth of
screening effects as B -> infinity. These features are utilized to interpret
the reduction of critical temperatures for the chiral and deconfinement at
finite B, recently found on the lattice. The structures of mesons are analyzed
and light mesons are identified. Applications for cold, dense quark matter are
also briefly discussed.

animals from different litters. This litter-to-litter variation, or ""litter
effects"", can influence the results in addition to the experimental factors of
interest. Furthermore, an experimental treatment can be applied to whole
litters rather than to individual offspring. For example, in the valproic acid
(VPA) model of autism, VPA is administered to pregnant females thereby inducing
the disease phenotype in the offspring. With this type of experiment the sample
size is the number of litters and not the total number of offspring. If such
experiments are not appropriately designed and analysed, the results can be
severely biased as well as extremely underpowered.
  Results: A review of the VPA literature showed that only 9% (3/34) of studies
correctly determined that the experimental unit (n) was the litter and
therefore made valid statistical inferences. In addition, litter effects
accounted for up to 61% (p <0.001) of the variation in behavioural outcomes,
which was larger than the treatment effects. In addition, few studies reported
using randomisation (12%) or blinding (18%), and none indicated that a sample
size calculation or power analysis had been conducted.
  Conclusions: Litter effects are common, large, and ignoring them can make
replication of findings difficult and can contribute to the low rate of
translating preclinical in vivo studies into successful therapies. Only a
minority of studies reported using rigorous experimental methods, which is
consistent with much of the preclinical in vivo literature.

proved successful for treating the structure and thermodynamics of a variety of
non-uniform liquids. By reformulating LMF in terms of one-body direct
correlation functions we recast the theory in the framework of classical
Density Functional Theory (DFT). We show that the general LMF equation for the
effective reference potential phi_R follows directly from the standard
mean-field DFT treatment of attractive interatomic forces. Using an accurate
(Fundamental Measures) DFT for the non-uniform hard-sphere reference fluid we
determine phi_R for a hard-core Yukawa liquid adsorbed at a planar hard wall.
In the approach to bulk liquid-gas coexistence we find the effective potentials
exhibit rich structure that can include damped oscillations at large distances
from the wall as well as the repulsive hump near the wall required to generate
the low density 'gas' layer characteristic of complete drying. We argue that it
would be difficult to obtain the same level of detail from other (non DFT
based) implementations of LMF. LMF emphasizes the importance of making an
intelligent division of the interatomic pair potential of the full system into
a reference part and a remainder that can be treated in mean-field
approximation. We investigate different divisions for an exactly solvable one-
dimensional model where the pair potential has a hard-core plus a linear
attractive tail. Results for the structure factor and the equation of state of
the uniform fluid show that including a significant portion of the attraction
in the reference system can be much more accurate than treating the full
attractive tail in mean-field approximation. We discuss further aspects of the
relationship between LMF and DFT.

higher variability than basins at lower latitudes/middle altitudes.

between species. Binding specificity has a strong impact on the evolution of
gene expression, because it determines how easily regulatory interactions are
gained and lost. Nevertheless, we have a relatively poor understanding of what
evolutionary forces determine the specificity of binding sites. Here we address
this question by studying regulatory modules composed of multiple binding
sites. Using a population-genetic model, we show that more complex regulatory
modules, composed of a greater number of binding sites, must employ binding
sites that are individually less specific, compared to less complex regulatory
modules. This effect is extremely general, and it hold regardless of the
regulatory logic of a module. We attribute this phenomenon to the inability of
stabilising selection to maintain highly specific sites in large regulatory
modules. Our analysis helps to explain broad empirical trends in the yeast
regulatory network: those genes with a greater number of transcriptional
regulators feature by less specific binding sites, and there is less variance
in their specificity, compared to genes with fewer regulators. Likewise, our
results also help to explain the well-known trend towards lower specificity in
the transcription factor binding sites of higher eukaryotes, which perform
complex regulatory tasks, compared to prokaryotes.

high X-ray efficiency of L_x(0.3-5 keV)/Edot_{rot} \sim 0.15 at converting
spin-down power into X-ray luminosity. The most favourable scenario for the

viable only in the case of a Compton nebula, while can be tentatively

resource-bounded verifier reads a dialogue about the membership of the string
in the language under consideration between a prover and a refuter. Our model
combines and generalizes the concepts of one-way interactive proof systems,
games of incomplete information, and probabilistically checkable
complete-information debate systems. We consider debates of partial and zero
information, where the prover is prevented from seeing some or all of the
messages of the refuter, as well as those of complete information. The classes
of languages with debates checkable by verifiers operating under severe bounds
on the memory and randomness are studied.
  We give full characterizations of versions of these classes corresponding to
simultaneous bounds of O(1) space and O(1) random bits, and of logarithmic
space and polynomial time. It turns out that constant-space verifiers, which
can only check complete-information debates for regular languages
deterministically, can check for membership in any language in P when allowed
to use a constant number of random bits. Similar increases also occur for zero-
and partial- information debates, from NSPACE(n) to PSPACE, and from E to
EXPTIME, respectively. Adding logarithmic space to these constant-randomness
verifiers does not change their power. When logspace debate checkers are
restricted to run in polynomial time without a bound on the number of random
bits, the class of debatable languages equals PSPACE for all debate types. We
also present a result on the hardness of approximating the quantified max word
problem for matrices that is a corollary of this characterization.

detection of the short X-ray bursts which led to its discovery (July 2011),
through the first stages of its outburst decay (April 2012). Our X-ray timing
analysis finds the source rotating with a period of P = 8.43772016(2) s and a
period derivative Pdot = 8.3(2) x 10e-14 s s-1, which entails an inferred
dipolar surface magnetic field of 2.7 x 10e13 G at the equator. This
measurement makes Swift J1822.3-1606 the second lowest magnetic field magnetar
(after SGR 0418+5729; Rea et al. 2010). Following the flux and spectral
evolution from the beginning of the outburst, we find that the flux decreased
by about an order of magnitude, with a subtle softening of the spectrum, both
typical of the outburst decay of magnetars. By modeling the secular thermal
evolution of Swift J1822.3+1606, we find that the observed timing properties of
the source, as well as its quiescent X-ray luminosity, can be reproduced if it
was born with a poloidal and crustal toroidal fields of Bp ~ 1.5 x 10e14 G and

show that the associated Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to a set of
coupled Camassa-Holm type equations. These support inviscid and smooth
localized travelling waves, which are numerically computed using the
Petviashvili method. In physical space they correspond to localized toroidal
vortices that concentrate near the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or wrap
around the pipe axis (centre vortexons) in agreement with the analytical
soliton solutions derived by Fedele (2012) for small and long-wave
disturbances. Inviscid singular vortexons with discontinuous radial velocities
are also numerically discovered as associated to special traveling waves with a
wedge-type singularity, viz. peakons. Their existence is confirmed by an
analytical solution of exponentially-shaped peakons that is obtained for the
particular case of the uncoupled Camassa-Holm equations. The evolution of a
perturbation is also investigated using an accurate Fourier-type spectral
scheme. We observe that an initial vortical patch splits into a centre vortexon
radiating vorticity in the form of wall vortexons. These can under go further
splitting before viscosity dissipate them, leading to a slug of centre
vortexons. The splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal
vorticity from the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with Eyink (2008). The
inviscid and smooth vortexon is similar to the nonlinear neutral structures
derived by Walton (2011) and it may be a precursor to puffs and slugs observed

disturbances.

are derived. These results apply to any momentum distribution function of the
particles, isotropic or anisotropic. Particles interact with the radiation
either in a non resonant mode when the frequency of the radiation exceeds their
characteristic synchrotron emission frequency, or quasi resonantly otherwise.
These two classes of particles contribute differently to the polarization
transfer coefficients. For a given frequency, this dichotomy corresponds to a
regime change in the dependence of the transfer coefficients on the parameters
of the particle s population. The derivation of the transfer coefficients
involves an exact expression of the conductivity tensor of the relativistic
magnetized plasma that has not been used hitherto in this context. Suitable
expansions valid at frequencies larger than the cyclotron frequency allow us to
analytically perform the summation over all resonances at high harmonics of the
relativistic gyrofrequency. The transfer coefficients are represented in the
form of two variable integrals that can be conveniently computed for any set of
parameters by using Olver s expansion of high order Bessel functions. We
particularize our results to a number of distribution functions, isotropic,
thermal or powerlaw, with different multipolar anisotropies of low order, or
strongly beamed. For isotropic distributions, the Faraday coefficients are
expressed in the form of a one variable quadrature over energy, for which we
provide the kernels in the high-frequency limit and in the asymptotic
low-frequency limit. A similar reduction to a one-variable quadrature over
energy is derived at high frequency for a large class of anisotropic
distribution functions that may form a basis on which any smoothly anisotropic
distribution could be expanded.

Mathematically, the problem of executing a gate becomes that of finding a

best, up to an error. To date, efficient methods to compute these gates only
strive to optimize for accuracy. We explore the possibility of using a generic
approach applicable to a variety of braiding problems based on evolutionary

for dg-categories over C and to prove that the Chern character map from
algebraic K-theory to periodic cyclic homology descends naturally to this new
invariant. This topological Chern map provides a natural candidate for the
existence of a rational structure on the periodic cylic homology of a smooth
proper dg-algebra, within the theory of noncommutative Hodge structures. The
definition of topological K-theory consists in two steps : taking the
topological realization of algebraic K-theory, and inverting the Bott element.
The topological realization is the left Kan extension of the functor ""space of
complex points"" to all simplicial presheaves over complex algebraic varieties.
Our first main result states that the topological K-theory of the unit
dg-category is the spectrum BU. For this we are led to prove a homotopical
generalization of Deligne's cohomological proper descent, using Lurie's proper
descent. The fact that the Chern character descends to topological K-theory is
established by using Kassel's K\""unneth formula for periodic cyclic homology
and once again the proper descent result. In the case of a dg-category of
perfect complexes on a smooth scheme, we show that we recover the usual
topological K-theory. Finally in the case of a finite dimensional associative
algebra, we show that the lattice conjecture holds. This gives a formula for
the periodic homology groups of a finite dimensional algebra in terms of the
stack of projective modules of finite type.

an approach is needed to dynamically model the data from ongoing spectroscopic

distribution of stars by a family of parametrized distribution function (DF)
proposed by McMillan and Binney, which are based on actions. We find that these
parametrized DFs are flexible enough to capture well the observed phase-space
distributions of individual abundance-selected Galactic subpopulations of stars
(`mono-abundance populations') for a disc-like gravitational potential, which
enables independent dynamical constraints from each of the Galactic
mono-abundance populations. We lay out a statistically rigorous way to
constrain the Galactic potential parameters by constructing the joint
likelihood of potential and DF parameters, and subsequently marginalizing over
the DF parameters. This approach explicitly incorporates the spatial selection
function inherent to all Galactic surveys, and can account for the
uncertainties of the individual position--velocity observations. On that basis,
we study the precision of the parameters of the Galactic potential that can be
reached with various sample sizes and realistic spatial selection functions. By
creating mock samples from the DF, we show that, even under a restrictive and
realistic spatial selection function, given a two-parameter gravitational
potential, one can recover the true potential parameters to a few per cent with
sample sizes of a few thousands. The assumptions of axisymmetry, of DFs that
are smooth in the actions and of no time variation remain important limitations

explode later than 2D simulations, and that L_crit at fixed mass accretion rate
is somewhat higher in 3D than in 2D. We find, however, that in 2D L_crit
increases as the numerical resolution of the simulation increases. In contrast
to some previous works, we argue that the average entropy of the gain region is
in fact not a good indicator of explosion but is rather a reflection of the
greater mass in the gain region in 2D. We compare our simulations to
semi-analytic explosion criteria and examine the nature of the convective
motions in 2D and 3D. We discuss the balance between neutrino-driven-buoyancy
and drag forces. In particular, we show that the drag force will be
proportional to a buoyant plume's surface area while the buoyant force is
proportional to a plume's volume and, therefore, plumes with greater
volume-to-surface area ratios will rise more quickly. We show that buoyant
plumes in 2D are inherently larger, with greater volume-to-surface area ratios,
than plumes in 3D. In the scenario that the supernova shock expansion is
dominated by neutrino-driven buoyancy, this balance between buoyancy and drag
forces may explain why 3D simulations explode later than 2D simulations and why
L_crit increases with resolution. Finally, we provide a comparison of our

Direct determination of these matrix elements will require a good tagging of
the t \rightarrow s transition (for |V_ts|) and t \rightarrow d transition (for
|V_td|) in the top quark decays, and a very large top quark statistics, which
is available at the LHC. Lacking a good tagging for the t \rightarrow d

|V_td| = O(10^-2), direct measurements of |V_ts| at the LHC with main emphasis

However, failures are a norm rather than being an exception in large clusters.
In this context, the MapReduce framework was designed so that node failures are

datacenter operators are increasingly pressed to effectively allocate their
resources among these client users. Yet while much work has been done in this
area, relatively little attention has been paid to studying perhaps the
ultimate lever of resource allocation: pricing. Most data centers today charge
users by ""bundling"" heterogeneous resources together in a fixed ratio and
selling these bundles to their clients. But bundling masks the fact that
different users require different combinations of resources (e.g., CPUs,
memory, bandwidth) to process their jobs. The presence of multiple resources in
fact allows an operator to offer many different types of pricing strategies,
which may have different effects on its revenue. Moreover, to avoid user
dissatisfaction, operators must consider the impact of their chosen prices on
the fairness of the jobs processed for different users. In this paper, we
develop an analytical framework that accounts for the fairness and revenue
tradeoffs that arise in a datacenter's multi-resource setting and the impact
that different pricing plans can have on this tradeoff. We characterize the
implications of different pricing plans on various fairness metrics and derive
analytical limits on the operator's fairness-revenue tradeoff. We then provide
an algorithm to navigate this tradeoff and compare the tradeoff points for
different pricing strategies on a data trace taken from a Google cluster.

morphological adaptation and amoeboid movement as it forages for food and may
be seen as a minimal example of complex robotic behaviour. Swarm computation
has previously been used to explore how spatiotemporal complexity can emerge
from, and be distributed within, simple component parts and their interactions.
Using a particle based swarm approach we explore the question of how to
generate collective amoeboid movement from simple non-oscillatory component
parts in a model of P. polycephalum. The model collective behaves as a cohesive
and deformable virtual material, approximating the local coupling within the
plasmodium matrix. The collective generates de-novo and complex oscillatory
patterns from simple local interactions. The origin of this motor behaviour is
distributed within the collective rendering is morphologically adaptive,
amenable to external influence, and robust to simulated environmental insult.
We show how to gain external influence over the collective movement by
simulated chemo-attraction (pulling towards nutrient stimuli) and simulated
light irradiation hazards (pushing from stimuli). The amorphous and distributed
properties of the collective are demonstrated by cleaving it into two
independent entities and fusing two separate entities to form a single device,
thus enabling it to traverse narrow, separate or tortuous paths. We conclude by
summarising the contribution of the model to swarm based robotics and
soft-bodied modular robotics and discuss the future potential of such material
approaches to the field.

approximate the permanent of an n*n matrix A. The algorithm runs in
O(n^2/eps^2) time, and approximates Per(A) to within eps*||A||^n additive
error. A major advantage of Gurvits's algorithm is that it works for arbitrary
matrices, not just for nonnegative matrices. This makes it highly relevant to
quantum optics, where the permanents of bounded-norm complex matrices play a
central role. Indeed, the existence of Gurvits's algorithm is why, in their
recent work on the hardness of quantum optics, Aaronson and Arkhipov (AA) had
to talk about sampling problems rather than estimation problems.
  In this paper, we improve Gurvits's algorithm in two ways. First, using an
idea from quantum optics, we generalize the algorithm so that it yields a
better approximation when the matrix A has either repeated rows or repeated
columns. Translating back to quantum optics, this lets us classically estimate
the probability of any outcome of an AA-type experiment---even an outcome
involving multiple photons ""bunched"" in the same mode---at least as well as
that probability can be estimated by the experiment itself. (This does not, of
course, let us solve the AA sampling problem.) It also yields a general upper
bound on the probabilities of ""bunched"" outcomes, which resolves a conjecture
of Gurvits and might be of independent physical interest.
  Second, we use eps-biased sets to derandomize Gurvits's algorithm, in the
special case where the matrix A is nonnegative. More interestingly, we
generalize the notion of eps-biased sets to the complex numbers, construct
""complex eps-biased sets,"" then use those sets to derandomize even our
generalization of Gurvits's algorithm to the multirow/multicolumn case (again
for nonnegative A). Whether Gurvits's algorithm can be derandomized for general
A remains an outstanding problem.

the central star can undergo Kozai oscillations---large-amplitude, coupled
variations in the orbital eccentricity and inclination. We first study how this
effect is modified by incorporating perturbations from the planetary
oblateness. Tremaine et al. (2009) found that, for planets with obliquities >
68.875 degrees, orbits in the equilibrium local Laplace plane are unstable to
eccentricity perturbations over a finite radial range, and execute
large-amplitude chaotic oscillations in eccentricity and inclination. In the
hope of making that treatment more easily understandable, we analyze the
problem using orbital elements, confirming this threshold obliquity.
Furthermore, we find that orbits inclined to the Laplace plane will be unstable
over a broader radial range, and that such orbits can go unstable for
obliquities less than 68.875 degrees. Finally, we analyze the added effects of
radiation pressure, which are important for dust grains and provide a natural
mechanism for particle semimajor axes to sweep via Poynting-Robertson drag
through any unstable range. We find that generally the effect persists;
however, the unstable radial range is shifted and small retrograde particles
can avoid the instability altogether. We argue that this is occurs because
radiation pressure modifies the equilibrium Laplace plane.

set of binary patterns (e.g., a neural code) as ""permitted sets"" of the
network. We introduce a simple Encoding Rule that selectively turns ""on""
synapses between neurons that co-appear in one or more patterns. The rule uses
synapses that are binary, in the sense of having only two states (""on"" or
""off""), but also heterogeneous, with weights drawn from an underlying synaptic
strength matrix S. Our main results precisely describe the stored patterns that
result from the Encoding Rule -- including unintended ""spurious"" states -- and
give an explicit characterization of the dependence on S. In particular, we
find that binary patterns are successfully stored in these networks when the
excitatory connections between neurons are geometrically balanced -- i.e., they
satisfy a set of geometric constraints. Furthermore, we find that certain types
of neural codes are ""natural"" in the context of these networks, meaning that
the full code can be accurately learned from a highly undersampled set of
patterns. Interestingly, many commonly observed neural codes in cortical and
hippocampal areas are natural in this sense. As an application, we construct
networks that encode hippocampal place field codes nearly exactly, following
presentation of only a small fraction of patterns. To obtain our results, we
prove new theorems using classical ideas from convex and distance geometry,
such as Cayley-Menger determinants, revealing a novel connection between these
areas of mathematics and coding properties of neural networks.

opposing results are reconciled. Basic principles related to crown shape,
energy optimization and the finite size scaling approach were used to define a
set of relationships based on a single parameter, which allows us to predict
the slope of the tree-size distributions in a steady state condition. We tested
the model predictions on four temperate mountain forests. Plots (4 ha each,
fully mapped) were selected with different degrees of human disturbance
(semi-natural stands vs. formerly managed). Results showed that the size
distribution range successfully fitted by the model is related to the degree of
forest disturbance: in semi-natural forests the range is wide, while in
formerly managed forests, the agreement with the model is confined to a very
restricted range. We argue that simple allometric relationships, at individual

N_f=8 and 12 nearly-massless fermions, using Monte Carlo Renormalization Group
(MCRG) two-lattice matching techniques to predict bare step-scaling functions
s_b. Traditional MCRG two-lattice matching requires that the renormalization
scheme be optimized for each bare lattice coupling, so that s_b is a composite
of many different discrete beta functions. We propose an improved procedure
that uses the Wilson flow to eliminate the need for this optimization of the RG
blocking transformation. While our 12-flavor results indicate an infrared fixed
point, s_b for N_f=8 is significantly different from zero until strong-coupling
lattice artifacts obstruct two-lattice matching. Although both procedures
produce qualitatively similar bare step-scaling functions, the new s_b obtained
by combining the Wilson flow with MCRG two-lattice matching have the distinct
advantage of corresponding to unique discrete beta functions.

Efficiency is defined as the ratio between distance traveled and the energy

large backward coefficient of friction and a small transverse coefficient of

the yield of fragment in 140$A$ MeV $^{64}$Ni + $^{9}$Be and 1$A$ GeV
$^{136}$Xe + $^{208}$Pb reactions. Relatively low $T$ of heavy fragments are
obtained in different reactions ($T$ ranges from 1 to 3MeV). $T$ is also found
to depend on the neutron-richness of the projectile. The incident energy
affects $T$ very little. $\Delta\mu/T$ (the ratio of the difference between the
chemical potential of neutron and proton to temperature) is found to increase
linearly as $N/Z$ of projectile increases. It is found that $T$ of the
$^{48}$Ca reaction, for which IYRs are of $A<50$ isobars, is affected greatly
by the temperature-corrected $\Delta B(T)$. But $T$ of reactions using IYRs of
heavier fragments are only slightly affected by the temperature-corrected
$\Delta B(T)$. The SAA model analysis gives a consistent overview of the
results extracted in this work. $T$ from IYR, which is for secondary fragment,
is different from that of the hot emitting source. $T$ and $\Delta\mu$ are
essentially governed by the sequential decay process.

perceptual bistability. Switching between percepts can occur through
fluctuations and/or a slow adaptive process. Here, we analyze switching
statistics in competitive networks with short term synaptic depression and
noise. We start by analyzing a ring model that yields spatially structured
solutions and complement this with a study of a space-free network whose
populations are coupled with mutual inhibition. Dominance times arising from
depression driven switching can be approximated using a separation of
timescales in the ring and space-free model. For purely noise-driven switching,
we use energy arguments to justify how dominance times are exponentially
related to input strength. We also show that a combination of depression and
noise generates realistic distributions of dominance times. Unimodal functions
of dominance times are more easily differentiated from one another using
Bayesian sampling, suggesting synaptic depression induced switching transfers
more information about stimuli than noise-driven switching. Finally, we analyze
a competitive network model of perceptual tristability, showing depression
generates a memory of previous percepts based on the ordering of percepts.

progressive, linear interfacial waves produces exponentially growing
instabilities in idealized (broken-line profiles), homogeneous or density
stratified, inviscid shear layers. In this paper, we generalize Holmboe's
mechanistic picture of linear shear instabilities by (i) not initially
specifying the type of the waves, and (ii) by providing the option for
non-normal growth. We demonstrate the mechanism behind linear shear
instabilities by proposing a purely kinematic model consisting of two linear,
Doppler-shifted, progressive interfacial waves moving in opposite directions.
Moreover, we have found a necessary and sufficient (N&S) condition for the
existence of exponentially growing instabilities in idealized shear flows. The
two interfacial waves, starting from arbitrary initial conditions, eventually
phase-lock and resonate (grow exponentially), provided the N&S condition is
satisfied. The instability mechanism occurring prior to reaching steady state
is non-modal, favouring rapid transient growth. The theoretical underpinnings
of our wave interaction model is analogous to that of synchronization between
two coupled harmonic oscillators. Our proposed model is used to study three
well known types of shear instabilities - Rayleigh/Kelvin-Helmholtz, Holmboe
and Taylor-Caulfield. We show that the N&S condition provides a range of
unstable wavenumbers for each instability type, and this range matches the
predictions of the canonical normal-mode based linear stability theory.

present. We utilise both the Friends-of-Friends (FOF) and Spherical Overdensity
(SO) halofinding methods to directly compare the mass function derived using
these commonly used halo definitions. The mass function from SO haloes exhibits
a clear evolution with redshift, especially during the recent era of dark
energy dominance (z < 1). We provide a redshift-parameterised fit for the SO
mass function valid for the entire redshift range to within ~20% as well as a
scheme to calculate the mass function for haloes with arbitrary overdensities.
The FOF mass function displays a weaker evolution with redshift. We provide a
`universal' fit for the FOF mass function, fitted to data across the entire
redshift range simultaneously, and observe redshift evolution in our data
versus this fit. The relative evolution of the mass functions derived via the
two methods is compared and we find that the mass functions most closely match
at z=0. The disparity at z=0 between the FOF and SO mass functions resides in
their high mass tails where the collapsed fraction of mass in SO haloes is ~80%
of that in FOF haloes. This difference grows with redshift so that, by z>20,
the SO algorithm finds a ~50-80% lower collapsed fraction in high mass haloes
than does the FOF algorithm, due in part to the significant over-linking
effects known to affect the FOF method.

interaction (LSRI) system as the evolution equation for propagation of
$N$-dispersive waves in weak Kerr type nonlinear medium in the small amplitude
limit. The mixed (bright-dark) type soliton solutions of a particular
(2+1)-dimensional multicomponent LSRI system, deduced from the general
multicomponent higher dimensional LSRI system, are obtained by applying the
Hirota's bilinearization method. Particularly, we show that the solitons in the
LSRI system with two short-wave components behave like scalar solitons. We
point out that for $N$-component LSRI system with $N>3$, if the bright solitons
appear in atleast two components, interesting collision behaviour takes place
resulting in energy exchange among the bright solitons. However the dark
solitons undergo standard elastic collision accompanied by a position-shift and
a phase-shift. Our analysis on the mixed bound solitons shows that the
additional degree of freedom which arises due to the higher dimensional nature
of the system results in a wide range of parameters for which the soliton
collision can take place.

the predictions of the analytic estimates deteriorate when the two frequencies

of the Fokker-Planck equation shows that in the birhythmic region, the two

range of the control parameters, thus the two limit cycles have properties in

tasks to accomplish to achieve quantum information processing. The standard
quantum process tomography (SQPT) has the unique property that it can be
applied without introducing any additional quantum resources. In present work,
we shall focus on the following two topics about the SQPT. At first, in the
SQPT protocol for a $d$-dimensional system, one should encounter a problem in
solving of a set of $d^4$ linear equations in order to get the matrix
containing the complete information about the unknown quantum channel. Until
now, the general form of the solution is unknown. And a long existed conviction
is that the solutions are not unique. Here, we shall develop a self-consistent
scheme, in which bounded linear operators are presented by vectors, to
construct the set of linear equations. With the famous Cramer's rule for the
set of linear equations, we are able to give the general form of the solution
and prove that it is unique. In second, the central idea of the SQPT is to
prepare a set of linearly independent inputs and measuring the outputs via the
quantum state tomography (QST). Letting the inputs and the measurements be
prepared by two sets of the rank-one positive-operator-valued measures [POVMs],
where each POVM is supposed to be linearly independent and informationally
complete (IC), we observe that SQPT now is equivalent to deciding a unknown
state with a set of product IC-POVM in the $d^2$-dimensional Hilbert space.
Following the general linear state tomography theory, we show that the product
symmetric IC-POVM should minimize the mean-square Hilbert-Schmidt distance
between the estimator and the true states. So, an optimal SQPT can be realized
by preparing both the inputs and the measurements as the symmetric IC-POVM.

we prove that the following parameterization of {\sc MaxSat} (denoted by
$(\nu(F)+k)$-\textsc{SAT}) is fixed-parameter tractable: Given a formula $F$,
decide whether we can satisfy at least $\nu(F)+k$ clauses in $F$, where $k$ is

  A formula $F$ is called variable-matched if $\nu(F)=|V(F)|.$ Let

main result implies fixed-parameter tractability of {\sc MaxSat} parameterized

results of Kullmann (2000) and Szeider (2004) for {\sc MaxSat} parameterized by
$\delta^*(F)$.
  To obtain our main result, we reduce $(\nu(F)+k)$-\textsc{SAT} into the
following parameterization of the {\sc Hitting Set} problem (denoted by
$(m-k)$-{\sc Hitting Set}): given a collection $\cal C$ of $m$ subsets of a
ground set $U$ of $n$ elements, decide whether there is $X\subseteq U$ such
that $C\cap X\neq \emptyset$ for each $C\in \cal C$ and $|X|\le m-k,$ where $k$

problem. We obtain two algorithms for $(m-k)$-{\sc Hitting Set}: a
deterministic algorithm of runtime $O((2e)^{2k+O(\log^2 k)} (m+n)^{O(1)})$ and
a randomized algorithm of expected runtime $O(8^{k+O(\sqrt{k})} (m+n)^{O(1)})$.

natural selection, hence it is based on a materialistic, i.e. matter-based,
view of science inspired by classical physics. But matter in itself is
considered a very complex notion in modern physics. More specifically, at a
microscopic level, matter and energy are no longer retained within their simple
form, and quantum mechanical models are proposed wherein potential form is
considered in addition to actual form. In this paper we propose an alternative
to standard Neodarwinian evolution theory. We suggest that the starting point
of evolution theory cannot be limited to actual variation whereupon is
selected, but to variation in the potential of entities according to the
context. We therefore develop a formalism, referred to as Context driven
Actualization of Potential (CAP), which handles potentiality and describes the
evolution of entities as an actualization of potential through a reiterated
interaction with the context. As in quantum mechanics, lack of knowledge of the
entity, its context, or the interaction between context and entity leads to
different forms of indeterminism in relation to the state of the entity. This
indeterminism generates a non-Kolmogorovian distribution of probabilities that
is different from the classical distribution of chance described by Darwinian
evolution theory, which stems from a 'actuality focused', i.e. materialistic,
view of nature. We also present a quantum evolution game that highlights the
main differences arising from our new perspective and shows that it is more
fundamental to consider evolution in general, and biological evolution in
specific, as a process of actualization of potential induced by context, for
which its material reduction is only a special case.

of the stars should harbor planets and that it is likely that terrestrial
planets are abundant in our galaxy. Among these planets, how many are
habitable, i.e. suitable for life and its evolution? These questions have been
discussed for years and we are slowly making progress. Liquid water remains the
key criterion for habitability. It can exist in the interior of a variety of
planetary bodies, but it is usually assumed that liquid water at the surface
interacting with rocks and light is necessary for the emergence of a life able
to modify its environment and evolve. A first key issue is thus to understand
the climatic conditions allowing surface liquid water assuming a suitable
atmosphere. This have been studied with global mean 1D models which has defined
the ""classical habitable zone"", the range of orbital distances within which
worlds can maintain liquid water on their surfaces (Kasting et al. 1993). A new
generation of 3D climate models based on universal equations and tested on
bodies in the solar system is now available to explore with accuracy climate
regimes that could locally allow liquid water. A second key issue is now to
better understand the processes which control the composition and the evolution
of the atmospheres of exoplanets, and in particular the geophysical feedbacks
that seems to be necessary to maintain a continuously habitable climate. From
that point of view, it is not impossible that the Earth's case may be special

together with a collection, $\cal T$, of distinct subsets of these items called
tests. We assume that $\cal T$ is a test cover, i.e., for each pair of items
there is a test in $\cal T$ containing exactly one of these items. The
objective is to find a minimum size subcollection of $\cal T$, which is still a
test cover. The generic parameterized version of {\sc Test Cover} is denoted by
$p(k,n,|{\cal T}|)$-{\sc Test Cover}. Here, we are given $([n],\cal{T})$ and a
positive integer parameter $k$ as input and the objective is to decide whether
there is a test cover of size at most $p(k,n,|{\cal T}|)$. We study four
parameterizations for {\sc Test Cover} and obtain the following:
  (a) $k$-{\sc Test Cover}, and $(n-k)$-{\sc Test Cover} are fixed-parameter
tractable (FPT).
  (b) $(|{\cal T}|-k)$-{\sc Test Cover} and $(\log n+k)$-{\sc Test Cover} are
W[1]-hard. Thus, it is unlikely that these problems are FPT.

  of balancing selection in Saccharomyces cerevisiae",,,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Estimates of the fraction of nucleotide substitutions driven by positive
selection vary widely across different species. Accounting for different
estimates of positive selection has been difficult, in part because selection
on polymorphism within a species is known to obscure a signal of positive
selection between species. While methods have been developed to control for the
confounding effects of negative selection against deleterious polymorphism, the
impact of balancing selection on estimates of positive selection has not been
assessed. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, there is no signal of positive selection
within protein coding sequences as the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous
polymorphism is higher than that of divergence. To investigate the impact of
balancing selection on estimates of positive selection we examined five genes
with high rates of nonsynonymous polymorphism in S. cerevisiae relative to
divergence from S. paradoxus. One of the genes, a high affinity zinc
transporter ZRT1, shows an elevated rate of synonymous polymorphism indicative
of balancing selection. The high rate of synonymous polymorphism coincides with
nonsynonymous divergence between three haplotype groups, which we find to be
functionally indistinguishable. We conclude that balancing selection is not
likely to be a common cause of genes harboring a large excess of nonsynonymous
polymorphism in yeast.

groups of individuals agree or disagree on specific issues. As such, modelling
opinion dynamics represents an important research area that has been
progressively acquiring relevance in many different domains. Existing
approaches have mostly represented opinions through discrete binary or
continuous variables by exploring a whole panoply of cases: e.g. independence,
noise, external effects, multiple issues. In most of these cases the crucial
ingredient is an attractive dynamics through which similar or similar enough
agents get closer. Only rarely the possibility of explicit disagreement has
been taken into account (i.e., the possibility for a repulsive interaction
among individuals' opinions), and mostly for discrete or 1-dimensional
opinions, through the introduction of additional model parameters. Here we
introduce a new model of opinion formation, which focuses on the interplay
between the possibility of explicit disagreement, modulated in a
self-consistent way by the existing opinions' overlaps between the interacting
individuals, and the effect of external information on the system. Opinions are
modelled as a vector of continuous variables related to multiple possible
choices for an issue. Information can be modulated to account for promoting
multiple possible choices. Numerical results show that extreme information
results in segregation and has a limited effect on the population, while milder
messages have better success and a cohesion effect. Additionally, the initial
condition plays an important role, with the population forming one or multiple
clusters based on the initial average similarity between individuals, with a
transition point depending on the number of opinion choices.

viscoelastic (Giesekus) fluids. The swimmers are assumed to be spherical, to
self-propel using tangential surface deformation, and the computations are
implemented using a finite element method. The emphasis of the study is on the
change of the swimming kinematics, energetics, and flow disturbance from
Newtonian to viscoelastic, and on the distinction between pusher and puller
swimmers. In all cases, the viscoelastic swimming speed is below the Newtonian
one, with a minimum obtained for intermediate values of the Weissenberg number,
$We$. An analysis of the flow field places the origin of this swimming
degradation in non-Newtonian elongational stresses. The power required for
swimming is also systematically below the Newtonian power, and always a
decreasing function of $We$. A detail energetic balance of the swimming problem
points at the polymeric part of the stress as the primary $We$-decreasing
energetic contribution, while the contributions of the work done by the swimmer
from the solvent remain essentially $We$-independent. In addition, we observe
negative values of the polymeric power density in some flow regions, indicating
positive elastic work by the polymers on the fluid. The hydrodynamic
efficiency, defined as the ratio of the useful to total rate of work, is always
above the Newtonian case, with a maximum relative value obtained at
intermediate Weissenberg numbers. Finally, the presence of polymeric stresses
leads to an increase of the rate of decay of the flow velocity in the fluid,
and a decrease of the magnitude of the stresslet governing the magnitude of the
effective bulk stress in the fluid.

(SUSY) to be an asymptotic state of the gauge theory in the high energy (UV)
limit, due to the renormalization group running of coupling constants of the
theory. The answer on whether this situation takes place or not, can be
resolved by dealing with the running of the ratios between Yukawa and scalar
couplings to the gauge coupling. The behavior of these ratios does not depend
too much on whether gauge coupling is asymptotically free (AF) or not. It can
be shown that the UV stable fixed point for the Yukawa coupling is not
supersymmetric. Taking this into account, one can break down SUSY only in the
scalar coupling sector. We consider two simplest examples of such breaking,
namely N=1 supersymmetric QED and QCD. In one of the cases one can construct an
example of SUSY being restored in the UV regime.

fission and fusion of plasmodia. Thus it may be suitable for exploring the

protoplasmic transport can be influenced by externally applied illumination
stimuli. We provide an exemplar vehicle mechanism by coupling the oscillations
of the plasmodium to drive the wheels of a Braitenberg vehicle and use light
stimuli to effect a steering mechanism. Using a particle model of Physarum we
show how emergent travelling wave patterns produced by competing oscillatory
domains may be used to to generate spatially represented actuation patterns. We
demonstrate different patterns of controllable motion, including linear,
reciprocal, rotational and helical, and demonstrate in simulation how dynamic
oscillatory patterns may be translated into motive forces for simple transport
of substances within a patterned environment.

show that such a random field interacting with threshold type detectors
produces clicks at random moments of time. And the corresponding probability
distribution can be approximately described by the formalism of quantum
mechanics. Hence, probabilities in quantum mechanics and classical statistical
mechanics differ not so much as it is typically claimed. The temporal structure
of the ""prequantum random field"" (which is the $L_2$-valued Wiener process)
plays the crucial role. Moments of detector's clicks are mathematically
described as hitting times which are actively used in classical theory of
stochastic processes. Born's rule appears as an approximate rule. In principle,
the difference between the ""precise detection probability rule"" derived in this
paper and the conventional Born's rule can be tested experimentally. In our
model the presence of the random gain in detectors playes a crucial role. We
also stress the role of the detection threshold. It is not merely a
technicality, but the fundamental element of the model.
