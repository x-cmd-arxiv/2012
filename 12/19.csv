ingredients for determining the jet luminosity. We reveal that neutrino-driven
jets in rapidly spinning Wolf-Rayet stars are capable of breaking out from the
stellar envelope, while those propagating in slower rotating progenitors fail
to jet breakout due to insufficient kinetic power. For progenitor models with
successful jet breakouts, the kinetic energy accumulated in the cocoon could be
as large as ~1051erg and might significantly contribute to the luminosity of
the afterglow emission or to the kinetic energy of the accompanying supernova
if nickel production takes place. We further analyze the post breakout phase
using a simple analytical prescription and conclude that the relativistic jet
component could produce events with an isotropic-luminosity Lp(iso) ~1052erg/s

rotating Wolf-Rayet stars as plausible progenitors of GRBs, while slowly

We show that the divergence is not associated with cusps in the contour but is
instead due to the contour intersecting itself because of the periodic boundary
conditions. One consequence of this is that the cyclic Wilson loop mixes under
renormalization with the correlator of two Polyakov loops. The resulting
renormalization equation is tested up to order g^6 and used to resum the
leading logarithms associated with the intersection divergence. Implications
for lattice studies of this operator, which may be relevant for the

depletion), and that a Jovian-mass companion cannot be the universal

focussing on how {\em small} autocatalytic networks are likely to be when they

catalytic reaction system is NP-hard. However, irreducible RAFs (irrRAFs) can
be constructed in polynomial time, and we show it is possible to determine in
polynomial time whether a bounded size set of these irrRAFs contain the
smallest RAFs within a system. Moreover, we derive rigorous bounds on the sizes
of small RAFs and use simulations to sample irrRAFs under the binary polymer
model. We then apply mathematical arguments to prove a new result suggested by
those simulations: at the transition catalysis level at which RAFs first form
in this model, small RAFs are unlikely to be present. We also investigate
further the relationship between RAFs and another formal approach to

correlation functions. A generic feature of considered random-walk processes is
an effect of velocity echo identified by the existence of time-dependent
regions where most of the walkers are moving in the direction opposite to their
initial motion. We discuss the relevance of the space-time velocity correlation
functions for the experimental studies of cold atom dynamics in an optical
potential and charge transport on micro- and nano-scales.

evolution of gas in galaxies, and the heating and ionization history of the
intergalactic medium. We present semi-analytic calculations of the escape
fraction of ionizing radiation for both hydrogen and helium from galaxies
ranging from primordial systems to disk-type galaxies that are not heavily
dust-obscured. We consider variations in the galaxy density profile, source
type, location, and spectrum, and gas overdensity/distribution factors. For
sufficiently hard first-light sources, the helium ionization fronts closely
track or advance beyond that of hydrogen. Key new results in this work include
calculations of the escape fractions for He I and He II ionizing radiation, and
the impact of partial ionization from X-rays from early AGN or stellar clusters
on the escape fractions from galaxy halos. When factoring in
frequency-dependent effects, we find that X-rays play an important role in
boosting the escape fractions for both hydrogen and helium, but especially for
He II. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for recent
observations of the He II reionization epoch at low redshifts, as well as the
UV data and emission-line signatures from early galaxies anticipated from
future satellite missions.

different viewpoints and generally produce correlated video streams. This
results in large amounts of highly redundant data. In order to save resources,
it is critical to handle properly this correlation during encoding and
transmission of the multiview data. In this work, we propose a
correlation-aware packet scheduling algorithm for multi-camera networks, where
information from all cameras are transmitted over a bottleneck channel to
clients that reconstruct the multiview images. The scheduling algorithm relies
on a new rate-distortion model that captures the importance of each view in the
scene reconstruction. We propose a problem formulation for the optimization of
the packet scheduling policies, which adapt to variations in the scene content.
Then, we design a low complexity scheduling algorithm based on a trellis search
that selects the subset of candidate packets to be transmitted towards
effective multiview reconstruction at clients. Extensive simulation results
confirm the gain of our scheduling algorithm when inter-source correlation
information is used in the scheduler, compared to scheduling policies with no
information about the correlation or non-adaptive scheduling policies. We
finally show that increasing the optimization horizon in the packet scheduling
algorithm improves the transmission performance, especially in scenarios where
the level of correlation rapidly varies with time.

proposed for the simulations of central heavy-ion collisions, one by Gale et

gives rise to mean fields isotropic in momentum, even when underlying momentum
distributions are anisotropic, making descriptions of early nonequilibrium
stages of collisions unrealistic. The second parametrization gives rise to
anisotropic mean fields, but is computationally expensive, because the mean
field has to be computed separately for every location of a nucleon in phase
space, through folding. Here we construct a parametrization of the nucleonic
mean field that yields an anisotropic mean field for an anisotropic momentum
distribution and is inexpensive computationally. To demonstrate the versatility
of our parametrization, we take the case of results from the parametrization by
Welke et al. and attempt to approximate them. In arriving at a suitable
anisotropic mean-field potential, we draw, on one hand, from the idea behind
the parametrization of Gale et al., of a separable expansion of the potential
energy, and, on the other, from the idea of a parallel expansion of the energy
and mean field in anisotropy. We show that using our novel parametrization we
can qualitatively and partially quantitatively reproduce the features of the

exploring the effects of mean-field anisotropy in collisions, without the
penalty of computational cost behind the folding parametrization.

significant impact on the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the
Standard Model in which the scalar masses, gaugino masses and tri-linear
A-terms are assumed to be universal at the GUT scale (the CMSSM). Much of the
low-mass parameter space in the CMSSM has been excluded by supersymmetric
particle searches at the LHC as well as by the Higgs mass measurement and the
emergent signal for B_s to mu^+ mu^-. Here, we consider the impact of these
recent LHC results on several variants of the CMSSM with a primary focus on
obtaining a Higgs mass of ~125 GeV. In particular, we consider the one- and
two-parameter extensions of the CMSSM with one or both of the Higgs masses set
independently of the common sfermion mass, m_0 (the NUHM1,2). We also consider
the one-parameter extension of the CMSSM in which the input universality scale
M_in is below the GUT scale (the sub-GUT CMSSM). We find that when M_in < M_GUT
large regions of parameter space open up where the relic density of neutralinos
can successfully account for dark matter with a Higgs boson mass ~125 GeV. In
some of these regions essential roles are played by coannihilation processes
that are usually less important in the CMSSM with M_in = M_GUT. Finally, we
reconsider mSUGRA models with sub-GUT universality, which have the same number
of parameters as the CMSSM. Here too, we find phenomenologically viable regions
of parameter space, which are essentially non-existent in GUT-scale mSUGRA
models. Interestingly, we find that the preferred range of the A-term straddles
that predicted by the simplest Polonyi model.

experiments within the standard model with massive Majorana neutrinos. Using
Bayesian inference makes it possible to take into account the theoretical
uncertainties on the nuclear matrix elements in a fully consistent way. First,
we analyze the data used to claim the observation of neutrinoless double beta
decay in Ge-76, and find strong evidence (according to Jeffrey's scale) for a
peak in the spectrum and moderate evidence for that the peak is actually close
to the energy expected for the neutrinoless decay. We also find a significantly
larger statistical error than the original analysis, which we include in the
comparison with other data. Then, we statistically test the consistency between
this claim with that of recent measurements using Xe-136. We find that the two
data sets are about 40 to 80 times more probable under the assumption that they
are inconsistent, depending on the nuclear matrix element uncertainties and the
prior on the smallest neutrino mass. Hence, there is moderate to strong
evidence of incompatibility, and for equal prior probabilities the posterior
probability of compatibility is between 1.3% and 2.5%. If one, despite such
evidence for incompatibility, combines the two data sets, we find that the
total evidence of neutrinoless double beta decay is negligible. If one ignores
the claim, there is weak evidence against the existence of the decay. We also
perform approximate frequentist tests of compatibility for fixed ratios of the
nuclear matrix elements, as well as of the no signal hypothesis. Generalization
to other sets of experiments as well as other mechanisms mediating the decay is
possible.

most gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), but the correct solution to its origin has not
been arrived at after more than a decade of work, preventing its use as a
powerful diagnostic tool. We resolve this long-standing problem and find that
He in the GRB's host HII region is responsible for most of the absorption. We
show that the X-ray absorbing column density (N_Hx) is correlated with both the
neutral gas column density and with the optical afterglow extinction (Av). This
correlation explains the connection between dark bursts and bursts with high
N_Hx values. From these correlations we exclude an origin of the X-ray
absorption which is not related to the host galaxy, i.e. the intergalactic
medium or intervening absorbers are not responsible. We find that the
correlation with the dust column has a strong redshift evolution, whereas the
correlation with the neutral gas does not. From this we conclude that the
column density of the X-ray absorption is correlated with the total gas column
density in the host galaxy rather than the metal column density, in spite of
the fact that X-ray absorption is typically dominated by metals. The strong
redshift evolution of N_Hx/Av is thus a reflection of the cosmic metallicity
evolution of star-forming galaxies. We conclude that the absorption of X-rays
in GRB afterglows is caused by He in the HII region hosting the GRB. While dust
is destroyed and metals are stripped of all of their electrons by the GRB to
great distances, the abundance of He saturates the He-ionising UV continuum
much closer to the GRB, allowing it to remain in the neutral or singly-ionised
state. Helium X-ray absorption explains the correlation with total gas, the
lack of strong evolution with redshift as well as the absence of dust, metal or
hydrogen absorption features in the optical-UV spectra.

highly complete, with 73 spectroscopic identifications out of 92 candidates.
Our color selection method is also highly efficient: of the 73 spectra
obtained, 71 are high redshift quasars. These observations reach below the
break in the luminosity function (M_1450* ~ -27). The bright end slope is steep
(beta <~ -4), with a constraint of beta < -3.1 at 95% confidence. The break
luminosity appears to evolve strongly at high redshift, providing an
explanation for the flattening of the bright end slope reported previously. We
find a factor of ~2 greater decrease in the number density of luminous quasars
(M_1450<-26) from z=5 to z=6 than from z=4 to z=5, suggesting a more rapid
decline in quasar activity at high redshift than found in previous surveys. Our

an r-process, that differs from the main r-process creating europium. Through a
detailed abundance study of Rb - Ag I will show, by comparing these abundances
to those of Ba and Eu, that their formation processes differ. The formation
process of Pd and Ag deviates from the weak/main s-process as well as from the
main r-process. Hence, Pd and Ag - and to some extend Zr - are created by a
second/weak r-process. However, the characteristics and formation site of this
process is not well understood. The abundance ratios of Rb/Zr help constrain
the neutron number density of the formation site, while comparing the Pd and Ag
abundances to yield predictions can provide limitations on the entropy and
electron fraction of the formation environment. This study presents clues on
the second r-process. Furthermore, the formation processes of the heavy
elements might not differ in a clear cut way. Several of these neutron-capture
processes might yield various amounts of heavy elements (e.g. Sr and Ba) at the

star-to-star abundance scatter for these two elements below [Fe/H]= -2.5.
Knowing their origin is important in the era of large surveys (e.g Gaia-ESO).
Strontium and barium will, limited by resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, be
the only detectable heavy elements in the most metal-poor stars. Hence, they
will, depending on metallicity, be the main tracers of the weak and main
s-/r-processes. Understanding the effects of stellar parameters, synthetic
spectrum codes, model atmospheres, and NLTE on the Sr abundances are crucial to
describe the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. I will present these effects for

terms of their evolutionary stage and population membership is of fundamental
importance. A standard approach relies on extracting this information from
stellar evolution models but requires the effective temperature, surface
gravity, and metallicity of a star obtained by independent means. In previous
work, we determined accurate effective temperatures and non-LTE logg and [Fe/H]
(NLTE-Opt) for a large sample of metal-poor stars, -3<[Fe/H]<-0.5, selected
from the RAVE survey. As a continuation of that work, we derive here their
masses, ages, and distances using a Bayesian scheme and GARSTEC stellar tracks.
For comparison, we also use stellar parameters determined from the widely-used
1D LTE excitation-ionization balance of Fe (LTE-Fe). We find that the latter
leads to systematically underestimated stellar ages, by 10-30%, but
overestimated masses and distances. Metal-poor giants suffer from the largest
fractional distance biases of 70%. Furthermore, we compare our results with
those released by the RAVE collaboration for the stars in common (DR3, Zwitter
et al. 2010, Seibert et al. 2011). This reveals -400 to +400 K offsets in
effective temperature, -0.5 to 1.0 dex offsets in surface gravity, and 10 to
70% in distances. The systematic trends strongly resemble the correlation we
find between the NLTE-Opt and LTE-Fe parameters, indicating that the RAVE DR3
data may be affected by the physical limitations of the 1D LTE synthetic
spectra. Our results bear on any study, where spectrophotometric distances
underlie stellar kinematics. In particular, they shed new light on the debated
controversy about the Galactic halo origin raised by the SDSS/SEGUE
observations.

through a static spacetime which asymptotes to Minkowski in the flow's past and
future, with a varying spatial geometry in-between. These are the first
explicit examples of stationary black holes which do not have Killing horizons.
When the CFT spacetime slowly varies, the CFT stress tensor derived from
gravity is well described by viscous hydrodynamics. For fast variation it is
not, and the solutions are stationary analogs of dynamical quenches, with the

  We analyze a 1.25x1.25 deg^2 wide-field sub-mm map obtained with LABOCA
(APEX), which provides the first spatially complete survey of the clouds in the

and SExtractor (SE) to identify individual clumps and determine their total
fluxes. In addition to assuming a common `typical' temperature for all clouds,
we also employ an empirical relation between cloud column densities and
temperature to determine an estimate of the individual clump temperatures, and
use this to determine individual clump masses.
  While the ClMF based on the CF extraction is very well described by a
power-law, the ClMFs based on GC and SE are better represented by a log-normal
distribution. We also find that the use of individual clump temperatures leads
to a shallower ClMF slope than the assumption of a common temperature (e.g. 20
K) of all clumps.
  The power-law of dN/dM \propto M^-1.95 we find for the CF sample is in good
agreement with ClMF slopes found in previous studies of other regions. The
dependence of the ClMF shape (power-law vs. log-normal distribution) on the
employed extraction method suggests that observational determinations of the
ClMF shape yields only very limited information about the true structure of the

pre-stellar clouds vs. power-law ClMFs as a signature of star-forming clouds
may be taken with caution for a single extraction algorithm without additional

halo clustering on very large scales. Photometric quasars, which can be seen
from cosmological redshifts z>2 even in wide-shallow optical surveys, are
promising tracers for constraining non-Gaussianity using this effect. However,
large-scale systematics can also mimic this signature of non-Gaussianity. In
order to assess the contribution of systematic effects, we cross-correlate
overdensity maps of photometric quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Data Release 6 (DR6) in different redshift ranges. We find that the maps
are significantly correlated on large scales, even though we expect the angular
distributions of quasars at different redshifts to be uncorrelated. This
implies that the quasar maps are contaminated with systematic errors. We
investigate the use of external templates that provide information on the
spatial dependence of potential systematic errors to reduce the level of
spurious clustering in the quasar data. We find that templates associated with
stellar density, the stellar color locus, airmass, and seeing are major
contaminants of the quasar maps, with seeing having the largest effect. Using
template projection, we are able to decrease the significance of the
cross-correlation measurement on the largest scales from 9.2-sigma to
5.4-sigma. Although this is an improvement, the remaining cross-correlation
suggests the contamination in this quasar sample is too great to allow a
competitive constraint on fNL by correlations internal to this sample. The SDSS
quasar catalog exhibits spurious number density fluctuations of ~2% rms, and we
need a contamination level less than 1% (0.6%) in order to measure values of
fNL less than 100 (10). Properly dealing with these systematics will be
paramount for future large scale structure surveys that seek to constrain
non-Gaussianity.

controlled by the exchange energy J=4t^2/U. One may then surmise, ignoring
retardation effects, that near-neighbor Coulomb repulsion V will destroy
superconductivity when it becomes larger than J, a condition that is easily
satisfied in cuprates for example. Using Cellular Dynamical Mean-Field theory
with an exact diagonalization solver for the extended Hubbard model, we show
that pairing, at strong coupling, is preserved even when V>>J, as long as
V<U/2. While at weak coupling V always reduces the spin fluctuations and hence
d-wave pairing, at strong coupling, in the underdoped regime, the increase of
J=4t^2/(U-V) caused by V increases binding at low frequency while the
pair-breaking effect of V is pushed to high frequency. These two effects
compensate in the underdoped regime, in the presence of a pseudogap. While the

that leads to the pseudogap, and retardation effects, protect d-wave
superconductivity from V.

variational parameters. What is perhaps a natural basis for quantum systems
confined to a spherical box in R^d, turns out to be appropriate also for
problems that are softly confined by U-shaped potentials, including those with
strong singularities at r=0. Specific examples are discussed in detail, along
with some bound N-boson systems

large-N approximation that predicted a phase transition from mixing to phase
separation as a function of the inter-species coupling. Here we explore the
dynamics of this phase transition following a quench and compare our results to
those found at zero temperature using the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii

temperature where only the condensates contribute to the densities. When the

transitions from a homogeneous mixture to a phase-separated structure for both

automatically obtained by clustering the tags. To ensure high accuracy for

349,608 DR10 CMASS galaxies from the Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey

reasonably well fit by a power-law model xi_QG(r)=(r/r_0)^(-gamma) on projected
scales of r_p=2-25 Mpc/h with r_0=6.61+-0.25 Mpc/h and gamma=1.69+-0.07. We
estimate a quasar linear bias of b_Q=1.38+-0.10 at <z>=0.53 from the CCF
measurements. This linear bias corresponds to a characteristic host halo mass
of ~4x10^12 M_sun/h, compared to ~10^13 M_sun/h characteristic host halo mass
for CMASS galaxies. We divide the quasar sample in luminosity and constrain the
luminosity dependence of quasar bias to be db_Q/dlogL=0.20+-0.34 or 0.11+-0.32
(depending on different luminosity divisions) for quasar luminosities
-23.5>M_i(z=2)>-25.5, implying a weak luminosity dependence of quasar
clustering for the bright end of the quasar population at <z>~0.5. We compare
our measurements with theoretical predictions, Halo Occupation Distribution
(HOD) models and mock catalogs. These comparisons suggest quasars reside in a
broad range of host halos, and the host halo mass distributions significantly
overlap with each other for quasars at different luminosities, implying a poor
correlation between halo mass and instantaneous quasar luminosity. We also find
that the quasar HOD parameterization is largely degenerate such that different
HODs can reproduce the CCF equally well, but with different outcomes such as
the satellite fraction and host halo mass distribution. These results highlight
the limitations and ambiguities in modeling the distribution of quasars with
the standard HOD approach and the need for additional information in populating
quasars in dark matter halos with HOD. [Abridged]

Our data show remarkable similarity between the dimethyl ether (CH3OCH3) and
the methyl formate (HCOOCH3) distributions even on a small scale (1.8""x0.8"" or
about 500 AU). This long suspected similarity, seen from both observational and
theoretical arguments, is demonstrated with unprecedented confidence, with a
correlation coefficient of maps of 0.8.
  A common precursor is the simplest explanation of our correlation.
Comparisons with previous laboratory work and chemical models suggest the major
role of grain surface chemistry and a recent release, probably with little
processing, of mantle molecules by shocks. In this case the CH3O radical
produced from methanol ice would be the common precursor (whereas ethanol,
C2H5OH, is produced from the radical CH2OH). The alternative gas phase scheme,
where protonated methanol CH3OH2+ is the common precursor to produce methyl
formate and dimethyl ether through reactions with HCOOH and CH3OH, is also
compatible with our data. Our observations cannot yet definitely allow a choice
between the different chemical processes, but the tight correlation between the
distributions of HCOOCH3 and CH3OCH3 strongly contrasts with the different
behavior we observe for the distributions of ethanol and formic acid. This
provides a very significant constraint on models.

small deflections of the light rays, there are two infinite sets of images

capture the basic physics of nanotechnological DNA systems, to the study of a
`burnt-bridges' DNA motor consisting of a single-stranded cargo that steps
processively along a track of single-stranded stators. We demonstrate that the
model is able to simulate such a system, and investigate the sensitivity of the
stepping process to the spatial separation of stators, finding that an
increased distance can suppress successful steps due to the build up of
unfavourable tension. The mechanism of suppression suggests that varying the
distance between stators could be used as a method for improving
signal-to-noise ratios for motors that are required to make a decision at a
junction of stators.

E^- and E^-E^+ are found for N two level molecules (TLMs) interacting with a
single mode electromagnetic field. The TLMs are assumed to be at equivalent
mode positions in the field. In the main body of the paper, the general results
are then simplified by assuming that all TLMs are in the up state at time 0.
Examples of spontaneous emission behavior including both Super Radiant behavior
and emission suppression are shown in Appendix E while stimulated emission with
all TLMs initially in the lower state is examined in Appendix F. Both resonant
and non resonant cases are considered in the main body. Analytic results are
presented for low numbers of TLMs. In the appendices, it will be shown that for
the mean photon number large in comparison to the number of TLMs, that the
Average Field Approximation (AFA) is a useful representation with much simpler
analytic form. The validity of this approximation will also be examined. In the
main paper, a comparison between the exact results and results using the AFA
will be presented for a small number of TLMs and a large average photon number.
It will be found that the results are in general remarkably similar but for non
resonance differ somewhat at a finer level of detail. Of interest is that the
ensemble averages for N TLMs is similar to the ensemble average for a single
TLM multiplied by the number of TLMs which is somewhat disappointing but is
believed to be the consequence of assuming that all TLMs are at equivalent mode
positions and large mean photon number. Some results for smaller photon number
will also be presented

processing, exhibiting many unique properties compared to the analogous
classical random walk. Here we introduce a model for a discrete-time quantum
walk with memory by endowing the walker with multiple recycled coins and using
a physical memory function via a history dependent coin flip. By numerical
simulation we observe several phenomena. First in one dimension, walkers with
memory have persistent quantum ballistic speed up over classical walks just as
found in previous studies of multi-coined walks with trivial memory function.
However, measurement of the multi-coin state can dramatically shift the mean of
the spatial distribution. Second, we consider spatial entanglement in a
two-dimensional quantum walk with memory and find that memory destroys
entanglement between the spatial dimensions, even when entangling coins are
employed. Finally, we explore behaviour in the presence of spatial randomness
and find that in contrast to single coined walks, multi-coined walks do not
localise and in fact a memory function can speed up the walk relative to a
fully decohered multi-coin walker with trivial memory. We explicitly show how
to construct linear optics circuits implementing the walks, and discuss
prospects for classical simulation.

formation mostly occurs above a threshold in gas surface density Sigma of
Sigma_c = 120 Msun pc^{-2} (A_K = 0.8). Heiderman infer a threshold by
combining low-mass star-forming regions, which show a steep increase in the
star formation rate per unit area Sigma_SFR with increasing Sigma, and massive
cores forming luminous stars which show a linear relation. We argue that these
observations do not require a particular density threshold. The steep
dependence of Sigma_SFR, approaching unity at protostellar core densities, is a
natural result of the increasing importance of self-gravity at high densities
along with the corresponding decrease in evolutionary timescales. The linear
behavior of Sigma_SFR vs. Sigma in massive cores is consistent with probing
dense gas in gravitational collapse, forming stars at a characteristic
free-fall timescale given by the use of a particular molecular tracer. The
low-mass and high-mass regions show different correlations between gas surface
density and the area A spanned at that density, with A=Sigma^{-3} for low-mass
regions and A=Sigma^{-1} for the massive cores; this difference, along with the
use of differing techniques to measure gas surface density and star formation,
suggests that connecting the low-mass regions with massive cores is
problematic. We show that the approximately linear relationship between dense
gas mass and stellar mass used by Lada similarly does not demand a particular
threshold for star formation, and requires continuing formation of dense gas.
Our results are consistent with molecular clouds forming by galactic
hydrodynamic flows with subsequent gravitational collapse.

classification methods have reached limiting accuracies when based on standard
ML data sets consisting of feature vectors and their classes. Greater accuracy
will require incorporation of prior structural information on data into
learning. We study methods to regularize feature vectors (unsupervised
regularization methods), analogous to supervised regularization for estimating
functions in ML. We study regularization (denoising) of ML feature vectors
using Tikhonov and other regularization methods for functions on ${\bf R}^n$. A
feature vector ${\bf x}=(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\{x_q\}_{q=1}^n$ is viewed as a
function of its index $q$, and smoothed using prior information on its
structure. This can involve a penalty functional on feature vectors analogous
to those in statistical learning, or use of proximity (e.g. graph) structure on
the set of indices. Such feature vector regularization inherits a property from
function denoising on ${\bf R}^n$, in that accuracy is non-monotonic in the
denoising (regularization) parameter $\alpha$. Under some assumptions about the
noise level and the data structure, we show that the best reconstruction
accuracy also occurs at a finite positive $\alpha$ in index spaces with graph
structures. We adapt two standard function denoising methods used on ${\bf
R}^n$, local averaging and kernel regression. In general the index space can be
any discrete set with a notion of proximity, e.g. a metric space, a subset of
${\bf R}^n$, or a graph/network, with feature vectors as functions with some
notion of continuity. We show this improves feature vector recovery, and thus
the subsequent classification or regression done on them. We give an example in

chaotic. How does chaos manifest itself in the quantum world? In this spirit,
we study the dynamical generation of entanglement as a signature of chaos in a
system of periodically kicked coupled-tops, where chaos and entanglement arise
from the same physical mechanism. The long-time entanglement as a function of
the position of an initially localized wave packet very closely correlates with
the classical phase space surface of section - it is nearly uniform in the
chaotic sea, and reproduces the detailed structure of the regular islands. The
uniform value in the chaotic sea is explained by the random state conjecture.
As classically chaotic dynamics take localized distributions in phase space to
random distributions, quantized versions take localized coherent states to
pseudo-random states in Hilbert space. Such random states are highly entangled,
with an average value near that of the maximally entangled state. Continuing on
our journey to find the footprints of chaos in the quantum world, we explore
quantum signatures of classical chaos by studying the rate of information gain
in quantum tomography. We find an increase in the rate of information gain and
hence higher fidelities in the process when the Floquet maps employed increase
in chaoticity. We make predictions for the information gain using random matrix
theory in the fully chaotic regime and show a remarkable agreement between the
two. The last part of this thesis is devoted to the study of the nature of
quantum correlations themselves. We present an operational interpretation of
quantum discord based on the quantum state merging protocol. Quantum discord is
the markup in the cost of quantum communication in the process of quantum state
merging, if one discards relevant prior information.

traces the Balmer filaments almost perfectly, but lies a few arcsec within,

decline in the IR behind the shock is presumably due largely to grain
destruction through sputtering. The emission drops far more rapidly than

than would be found closer to the Galactic plane. The rapid drop may result in
part from a grain density that has always been lower -- a relic effect from an

grain destruction rates still seem to be required. Spectra from three positions
along the NW filament from the IRS instrument all show only a featureless

  Galaxy Evolution through Secular Processes. Edts: R. Buta and D. Pfenniger",,,,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bar driven secular evolution plays a key role in changing the morphology and
kinematics of disk galaxies, leading to the formation of rapidly rotating
boxy/peanut bulges. If these disk galaxies also hosted a preexisting classical
bulge, how would the secular evolution influence the classical bulge, and also
the observational properties.
  We first study the co-evolution of a bar and a preexisting non-rotating
low-mass classical bulge such as might be present in galaxies like the Milky
Way. It is shown with N-body simulations that during the secular evolution,
such a bulge can gain significant angular momentum emitted by the bar through
resonant and stochastic orbits. Thereby it transforms into a cylindrically
rotating, anisotropic and triaxial object, embedded in the fast rotating boxy
bulge that forms via disk instability (Saha et al. 2012). The composite
boxy/peanut bulge also rotates cylindrically.
  We then show that the growth of the bar depends only slightly on the rotation
properties of the preexisting classical bulge. For the initially rotating small
classical bulge, cylindrical rotation in the resulting composite boxy/peanut
bulge extends to lower heights (Saha & Gerhard 2012). More massive classical
bulges also gain angular momentum emitted by the bar, inducing surprisingly
large rotational support within about 4 Gyrs (Saha et al. in prep).

Kids Array (NIKA) collaboration has been to investigate the suitability of
these detectors for deployment at the 30-meter IRAM telescope located on Pico
Veleta in Spain. Compared to microwave kinetic inductance detectors (MKID),
using quarter wavelength resonators, the resonant circuit of a LEKID consists
of a discrete inductance and capacitance coupled to a feedline. A high and
constant current density distribution in the inductive part of these resonators
makes them very sensitive. Due to only one metal layer on a silicon substrate,
the fabrication is relatively easy. In order to optimize the LEKIDs for this
application, we have recently probed a wide variety of individual resonator and
array parameters through simulation and physical testing. This included
determining the optimal feed-line coupling, pixel geometry, resonator
distribution within an array (in order to minimize pixel cross-talk), and
resonator frequency spacing. Based on these results, a 144-pixel Aluminum array
was fabricated and tested in a dilution fridge with optical access, yielding an
average optical NEP of ~2E-16 W/Hz^1/2 (best pixels showed NEP = 6E-17 W/Hz^1/2

approximates that done in an ordinary changing potential. The quality of the
approximation is set by the ratio of the update time of the feedback loop to
the relaxation time of motion in the virtual potential.

differential modules defined by linear multidimensional systems, that is by
linear systems of ordinary differential (OD) or partial differential (PD)
equations of any order, with any number of independent variables, any number of
unknowns and even with variable coefficients in a differential field. The first
and main idea is to replace unmixed polynomial ideals by "" pure differential
modules "". The second idea is to notice that a module is 0-pure if and only if
it is torsion-free and thus if and only if it admits an "" absolute
parametrization "" by means of arbitrary potential like functions, or,
equivalently, if it can be embedded into a free module by means of an ""
absolute localization "". The third idea is to refer to a difficult theorem of
algebraic analysis saying that an r-pure module can be embedded into a module
of projective dimension equal to r, that is a module admitting a projective
resolution with exactly r operators. The fourth and final idea is to establish
a link between the use of extension modules for such a purpose and specific
formal properties of the underlying multidimensional system through the use of
involution and a ""relative localization "" leading to a ""relative
parametrization "", that is to the use of potential-like functions satisfying a
kind of ""minimum differential constraint "" limiting, in some sense, the number
of independent variables appearing in these functions, in a way similar to the

manifolds. We focus on the following intriguing question: what observables are
appropriated to measure Brownian motion in curved manifolds? In particular, for
those d-dimensional manifolds embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{d+1}$ we define three
quantities for the displacement's notion, namely, the geodesic displacement,
$s$, the Euclidean displacement, $\deltaR$, and the projected Euclidean
displacement $\deltaR_{\perp}$. In addition, we exploit the Weingarten-Gauss
equations in order to calculate the mean-square Euclidean displacement's in the
short-time regime. Besides, it is possible to prove exact formulas for these
expectation values, at all times, in spheres and minimal hypersurfaces. In the
latter case, Brownian motion corresponds to the typical diffusion in flat
geometries, albeit minimal hypersurfaces are not intrinsically flat. Finally,
the two-dimensional case is emphasized since its relation to the lateral
diffusion in biological membranes.

particularly so when operating in a radiatively inefficient mode, where they
launch powerful jets that reshape their surroundings. However, identifying them
is difficult, since radio observations commonly have resolutions of between 1
arcsec and 10 arcsec, which is equally sensitive to radio emission from
star-forming activity and from AGN. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
observations allow one to filter out all but the most compact non-thermal
emission from radio survey data. The observational and computational demands to
do this in large surveys have been, until recently, too high to make such
undertakings feasible. Only the recent advent of wide-field observing
techniques have facilitated such observations, and we here present the results
from a survey of 217 radio sources in the Lockman Hole/XMM field. We describe
in detail some new aspects of the calibration, including primary beam
correction, multi-source self-calibration, and mosaicing. As a result, we
detected 65 out of the 217 radio sources and were able to construct, for the
first time, the source counts of VLBI-detected AGN. They indicate that at least
15%-25% of the sub-mJy radio sources are AGN-driven, consistent with recent
findings using other AGN selection techniques. We have used ancillary data to
investigate the AGN hosts. We find that among the sources nearby enough to be
resolved in the optical images, 88% (23/26) could be classified as early-type
or bulge-dominated galaxies. While 50% of these sources are correctly
represented by the SED of an early-type galaxy, for the rest the best fit was
obtained with a heavily extinct starburst template, an effect we ascribe to a
degeneracy in the fit. Overall, the typical hosts of VLBI-detected sources are
in good agreement with being early-type or bulge-dominated galaxies.

produce hole bands centered at zero two-dimensional (2D) momentum in the

threshold Hund coupling when long-range antiferromagnetic order across the d+ =

that is off-diagonal in the orbital indices. This leads to two hole-pocket
Fermi surfaces centered at zero 2D momentum. Proximity to a commensurate
spin-density wave (cSDW) that exists above the threshold Hund coupling results
in emergent Fermi surface pockets about cSDW momenta at a quantum critical
point (QCP). This motivates the introduction of a new Gutzwiller wavefunction

indicates that the dispersion of the nested band of one-particle states that

Red Supergiant phase to the Wolf-Rayet or Luminous Blue Variable phase. The
star has an ionised wind and using the Br gamma hydrogen recombination emission
we assess the mass-loss on spatial scales of order 1 au. We present new VLT
Interferometer AMBER data which are combined with all other AMBER data in the
literature. The final dataset covers a position angle range of 180 degrees and
baselines up to 110 meters. The spectrally dispersed visibilities, differential
phases and line flux are conjointly analyzed and modelled. We also present
AMBER/FINITO observations which cover a larger wavelength range and allow us to
observe the Na I doublet at 2.2 micron. The data are complemented by X-Shooter
data, which provide a higher spectral resolution view. The Brackett gamma line
and the Na I doublet are both spatially resolved. After correcting the AMBER
data for the fact that the lines are not spectrally resolved, we find that Br
gamma traces a ring with a diameter of 4.18 milli-arcseconds. We consider a
geometric model in which the Br gamma emission emerges from the top and bottom
rings of an hour-glass shaped structure, viewed almost pole-on. It provides
satisfactory fits to most visibilities and differential phases. The fact that
we detect line emission from a neutral metal like Na I within the ionized
region, a very unusual occurrence, suggests the presence of a dense
pseudo-photosphere. The ionized wind can be reproduced with a polar wind, which
could well have the shape of an hour-glass. The resolved Na I emission is found
to occur on scales barely larger than the continuum. This fact and that many
Yellow Hypergiants exhibit this comparatively rare emission hints at the
presence of a ""Yellow"" or even ""White Wall"" in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram,
preventing them from visibly evolving to the blue.

of state-dependent communication channels are of timely interest and
importance. Therefore, we extend the study of action-dependent channels, which
until now focused on point-to-point models, to multiple-access channels (MAC).
In this paper, we consider a two-user, state-dependent MAC, in which one of the
encoders, called the informed encoder, is allowed to take an action that
affects the formation of the channel states. Two independent messages are to be
sent through the channel: a common message known to both encoders and a private
message known only to the informed encoder. In addition, the informed encoder
has access to the sequence of channel states in a non-causal manner. Our
framework generalizes previously evaluated settings of state dependent
point-to-point channels with actions and MACs with common messages. We derive a
single letter characterization of the capacity region for this setting. Using
this general result, we obtain and compute the capacity region for the Gaussian
action-dependent MAC. The unique methods used in solving the Gaussian case are
then applied to obtain the capacity of the Gaussian action-dependent
point-to-point channel; a problem was left open until this work. Finally, we
establish some dualities between action-dependent channel coding and source
coding problems. Specifically, we obtain a duality between the considered MAC
setting and the rate distortion model known as ""Successive Refinement with
Actions"". This is done by developing a set of simple duality principles that
enable us to successfully evaluate the outcome of one problem given the other.

friction is far from homogeneous. I show here that the distribution of the
dissipated power within a spherically stratified body is a linear combination
of three angular functions. These angular functions depend only on the tidal
potential whereas the radial weights are specified by the internal structure of
the body. The 3D problem of predicting spatial patterns of dissipation at all
radii is thus reduced to the 1D problem of computing weight functions. I
compute spatial patterns in various toy models without assuming a specific
rheology: a viscoelastic thin shell stratified in conductive and convective
layers, an incompressible homogeneous body and a two-layer model of uniform
density with a liquid or rigid core. For a body in synchronous rotation
undergoing eccentricity tides, dissipation in a mantle surrounding a liquid
core is highest at the poles. Within a softer layer (asthenosphere or icy
layer), the same tides generate maximum heating in the equatorial region with a
significant degree-four structure if the layer is thin. Tidal heating patterns
are thus of three main types: mantle dissipation (including the case of a
floating icy crust), dissipation in a thin soft layer and dissipation in a
thick soft layer. I illustrate the method with applications to Europa, Titan
and Io. The formalism described in this paper applies to dissipation within
solid layers of planets and satellites for which internal spherical symmetry
and viscoelastic linear rheology are good approximations.

the required magnetic field. The new toroid will be built up from eight, one
meter wide and 20 m long, racetrack coils. The toroid is sized about 4 m in
diameter and 22 m in length. It is designed to realize a peak magnetic field of
5.4 T with a stored energy of 500 MJ. The magnetic field optimization process
to arrive at maximum detector yield is described. In addition, force and stress

to commonly used approaches the charm quark is kept as an active degree of

Moving away from the GIM limit involves the computation of diagrams containing

significant deviations from the Standard Model (SM) expectations, prompting
much speculation about its couplings to the other particles. Although the
latest data has veered towards conformity with the SM, there is yet room for a
sizable deviation from the SM values of the coupling of the Higgs boson with
$t\bar{t}$, and to a smaller extent, of that with $W^+W^-$ and $ZZ$. Keeping
the fluid nature of the data in mind, this opens up an interesting avenue to
explore regarding unitarity of gauge boson scattering and the stability of the
electroweak vacuum in the presence of anomalous couplings. We show that, for
some typical benchmark points, unitarity in gauge boson scattering breaks down
between 1 and 10 TeV. We also show that if there are no new light degrees of
freedom, the Higgs quartic coupling becomes negative at around the same point,
making the electroweak vacuum unstable. Thus, some new ultraviolet completing
new physics is demanded at that scale to cancel both these anomalous behaviours
if such deviations from the SM couplings are indeed established.

critical point (QCP) while the fidelity susceptibility shows a divergence right

which the magnitude of the alternating potential is changed starting from zero
(the SF phase) to a non-zero value (the MI phase) according to a half Rosen
Zener (HRZ) scheme or brought back to the initial value following a full Rosen
Zener (FRZ) scheme. The local von Neumann entropy density is calculated in the
final MI phase (following the HRZ quench) and is found to be less than the
equilibrium value ($\log 2$) due to the defects generated in the final state as
a result of the quenching starting from the QCP of the system. We also briefly
dwell on the FRZ quenching scheme in which the system is finally in the SF
phase through the intermediate MI phase and calculate the reduction in the
supercurrent and the non-zero value of the residual local entropy density in
the final state. Finally, the loss of coherence of a qubit (globally and weekly
coupled to the HCB system) which is initially in a pure state is investigated
by calculating the time-dependence of the decoherence factor when the HCB chain
evolves under a HRZ scheme starting from the SF phase. This result is compared

us are quite general and can be degenerated to the well-known energy conditions
in General Relativity and $f(R)$ theories of gravity with arbitrary coupling,
non-minimal coupling and non-coupling between matter and geometry,
respectively, as special cases. To exemplify how to use these energy conditions
to restrict $f(R,L_{m})$ gravity, we consider a special model in the FRW

gauge theories there is a number of subtleties which, though often unnecessary
to deal with in the order-of-magnitude type of calculations, have to be taken
into account if fully consistent results are sought for. Within the ""canonical""
effective-potential approach these are, for instance: the need to handle
infinite series of nested commutators of derivatives of field-dependent mass
matrices, the need to cope with spurious IR divergences emerging in the
consistent leading-order approximation and, in particular, the need to account
for the fine interplay between the renormalization effects in the one- and
two-point Green's functions which, indeed, is essential for the proper stable
vacuum identification and, thus, for the correct interpretation of the results.
In this note we illustrate some of these issues in the realm of the minimal
abelian Higgs model and two of its simplest extensions including extra heavy
scalars in the spectrum in attempt to exemplify the key aspects of the usual
""hierarchy problem"" lore in a very specific and simple setting. We emphasise
that, regardless of the omnipresent polynomial cut-off dependence in the
one-loop corrections to the scalar two-point function, the physical Higgs boson
mass is always governed by the associated symmetry-breaking VEV and, as such,
it is generally as UV-robust as all other VEV-driven masses in the theory.

mathematical tools that are used for the derivation of concentration

applications to communications and coding. In addition to being a survey, this
monograph also includes various new recent results derived by the authors. The
first part of the monograph introduces classical concentration inequalities for
martingales, as well as some recent refinements and extensions. The power and
versatility of the martingale approach is exemplified in the context of codes
defined on graphs and iterative decoding algorithms, as well as codes for
wireless communication. The second part of the monograph introduces the entropy
method, an information-theoretic technique for deriving concentration
inequalities. The basic ingredients of the entropy method are discussed first
in the context of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities, which underlie the
so-called functional approach to concentration of measure, and then from a
complementary information-theoretic viewpoint based on transportation-cost
inequalities and probability in metric spaces. Some representative results on
concentration for dependent random variables are briefly summarized, with
emphasis on their connections to the entropy method. Finally, we discuss
several applications of the entropy method to problems in communications and
coding, including strong converses, empirical distributions of good channel
codes, and an information-theoretic converse for concentration of measure.

functions in irregular shapes. We give explicit results for the mean and
variance of the nodal volume in arbitrary dimension, and for their limiting
distribution. For the mean nodal volume we calculate the effect of the boundary
of the cuboid where Dirichlet boundary conditions reduce the nodal volume
compared to the bulk. Boundary effects for chaotic wave functions are
calculated using random waves which satisfy a Dirichlet boundary condition on a
hyperplane. We put forward several conjectures what properties of cuboids

from networks (quantum graphs) which are due to the complex connectivity of the

leads to narrow resonances which do not fit in any of the prominent paradigms
for narrow resonances (classical barriers, localization due to disorder,
chaotic scattering). We call these resonances `topological' to emphasize their
origin in the non-trivial connectivity. Topological resonances have a clear and
unique signature which is apparent in the statistics of the resonance
parameters (such as e.g., the width, the delay time or the wave-function
intensity in the graph). We discuss this phenomenon by providing analytical
arguments supported by numerical simulation, and identify the features of the
above distributions which depend on genuine topological quantities such as the
length of the shortest cycle (girth). These signatures cannot be explained
using any of the other paradigms for narrow resonances. Finally, we propose an
experimental setting where the topological resonances could be demonstrated,
and study the stability of the relevant distribution functions to moderate

efficiently mimic the constraints satisfied by exact solutions, including
material conservation and positivity, while also maintaining high-order
accuracy and numerical stability. Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and WENO schemes
allow efficient high-order accuracy while maintaining conservation. Positivity
limiters developed by Zhang and Shu ensure a minimum time step for which
positivity of cell average quantities is maintained without sacrificing
conservation or formal accuracy; this is achieved by linearly damping the
deviation from the cell average just enough to enforce a cell positivity
condition that requires positivity at boundary nodes and strategically chosen
interior points.
  We assume that the set of positive states is convex; it follows that
positivity is equivalent to scalar positivity of a collection of affine
functionals. Based on this observation, we generalize the method of Zhang and
Shu to a framework that we call outflow positivity limiting: First, enforce
positivity at boundary nodes. If wave speed desingularization is needed, cap
wave speeds at physically justified maxima by using remapped states to
calculate fluxes. Second, apply linear damping again to cap the boundary
average of all positivity functionals at the maximum possible (relative to the
cell average) for a scalar-valued representation positive in each mesh cell.
This be done by enforcing positivity of the retentional, an affine combination
of the cell average and the boundary average, in the same way that Zhang and
Shu would enforce positivity at a single point (and with similar computational
expense). Third, limit the time step so that cell outflow is less than the
initial cell content. This framework guarantees essentially the same
positivity-preserving time step as is guaranteed if positivity is enforced at
every point in the mesh cell.

Investigation of null geodesic equations in the Szekeres models shows that
observers in favourable positions would see galaxies drift across the sky at a
rate of up to $10^{-6}$ arc seconds per year. Such a drift would be possible to
measure using devices that are under construction; the required time of
monitoring would be $\approx10$ years. This effect is zero in the FLRW models,
so it provides a measure of inhomogeneity of the Universe. In the Szekeres
models, the condition for zero drift is zero shear. But in the shearfree normal
models, the condition for zero drift is that, in the comoving coordinates, the
time dependence of the metric completely factors out.

emission are coupled in such Galactic sources, with the radio emission
originating in a relativistic jet thought to be launched from the innermost
regions near the black hole, with the most powerful emission occurring when the
rate of infalling matter approaches a theoretical maximum (the Eddington

absorption of soft X-rays in the interstellar medium precludes determining the
causal sequence of events that leads to the ejection of the jet. Here we report
radio and X-ray observations of a bright new X-ray source whose peak luminosity

extremely high and shows variability on a timescale of tens of minutes, arguing

coupled to a bosonic chain. We rely on the use of a spin-wave theory describing
the Gaussian fluctuations around the mean-field solution, and focus on
spin-boson chains arising as a generalization of the Dicke Hamiltonian. Our
model is motivated by experimental setups such as trapped ions, or atoms/qubits
coupled to cavity arrays. This situation corresponds to the cooperative
(E$\otimes$$\beta$) Jahn-Teller distortion studied in solid-state physics.
However, the ability to tune the parameters of the model in quantum optical
setups opens up a variety of novel intriguing situations. The main focus of
this paper is to review the spin-wave theoretical description of this problem
as well as to test the validity of mean-field theory. Our main result is that
deviations from mean-field effects are determined by the interplay between
magnetic order and mesoscopic cooperativity effects, being the latter strongly
size-dependent.

planet and a ""super-Earth"" with the radius of 2 R_Earth and a mass of 10
M_Earth, located within the habitable zone at ~0.24 AU. We investigate the
formation of extended atomic hydrogen coronae under the influences of the
stellar XUV flux (soft X-rays and EUV), stellar wind density and velocity,
shape of a planetary obstacle (e.g., magnetosphere, ionopause), and the loss of
planetary pick-up ions on the evolution of hydrogen-dominated upper
atmospheres. Stellar XUV fluxes which are 1, 10, 50 and 100 times higher
compared to that of the present-day Sun are considered and the formation of
high-energy neutral hydrogen clouds around the planets due to the
charge-exchange reaction under various stellar conditions have been modeled.
Charge-exchange between stellar wind protons with planetary hydrogen atoms, and
photoionization, leads to the production of initially cold ions of planetary
origin. We found that the ion production rates for the studied planets can vary
over a wide range, from ~1.0x10^{25} s^{-1} to ~5.3x10^{30} s^{-1}, depending
on the stellar wind conditions and the assumed XUV exposure of the upper
atmosphere. Our findings indicate that most likely the majority of these
planetary ions are picked up by the stellar wind and lost from the planet.
Finally, we estimate the long-time non-thermal ion pick-up escape for the
studied planets and compare them with the thermal escape. According to our
estimates, non-thermal escape of picked up ionized hydrogen atoms over a
planet's lifetime varies between ~0.4 Earth ocean equivalent amounts of
hydrogen (EO_H) to <3 EO_H and usually is several times smaller in comparison
to the thermal atmospheric escape rates.

for perfect mappings defined on any Hausdorff space(compactness and
metrizability not necessarily required). This is achieved through the
consideration of co-compact covers of the space. The advantages of co-compact
entropy include: 1) it does not require the space to be compact, and thus
generalizes Adler, Konheim and McAndrew's topological entropy of continuous
mappings on compact dynamical systems, and 2) it is an invariant of topological
conjugation, compared to Bowen's entropy that is metric-dependent. Other
properties of co-compact entropy are investigated, e.g., the co-compact entropy
of a subsystem does not exceed that of the whole system. For the linear system
(R, f) defined by f(x) = 2x, the co-compact entropy is zero, while Bowen's
entropy for this system is at least log 2. More general, it is found that
co-compact entropy is a lower bound of Bowen's entropies, and the proof of this
result generates the Lebesgue Covering Theorem to co-compact open covers of
non-compact metric spaces, too.

mean method, well known in international standards (ISO 9869 - 1994) for the
determination of the thermal resistance using dynamic data, was used. The

introduced to mathematically describe certain non-violent animal behavior. The
original setup considers two participating players in a one-shot game competing
for a given prize by waiting. This model has later been extended to several
different models allowing more than two players. One of the first of these
N-player generalizations was due to J. Haigh and C. Cannings (Acta Appl.
Math.14) where two possible models are mainly discussed; one in which the game
starts afresh with new strategies each time a player leaves the game, and one
where the players have to stick with the strategy they chose initially. The
first case is well understood whereas, for the second case, much is still left
open. In this paper we study the asymptotic behavior of these two models as the
number of players tend to infinity and prove that their time evolution coincide
in the limit. We also prove new results concerning the second model in the

vague and obscure even for the majority of its users. The reason for this is
the lack of a suitable definition for the term ""information"". In my attempt to
amend this bizarre situation, I have realized that, following the insights of
Kolmogorov's Complexity theory, information can be defined as a description of
structures observable in a given data set. Two types of structures could be
easily distinguished in every data set - in this regard, two types of
information (information descriptions) should be designated: physical
information and semantic information. Kolmogorov's theory also posits that the
information descriptions should be provided as a linguistic text structure.
This inevitably leads us to an assertion that information processing has to be
seen as a kind of text processing. The idea is not new - inspired by the
observation that human information processing is deeply rooted in natural
language handling customs, Lotfi Zadeh and his followers have introduced the
so-called ""Computing With Words"" paradigm. Despite of promotional efforts, the
idea is not taking off yet. The reason - a lack of a coherent understanding of
what should be called ""information"", and, as a result, misleading research
roadmaps and objectives. I hope my humble attempt to clarify these issues would
