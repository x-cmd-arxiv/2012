dedicated backup servers, nowadays a standard solution, making backups directly
on organization's workstations should be cheaper (as existing hardware is
used), more efficient (as there is no single bottleneck server) and more
reliable (as the machines are geographically dispersed).
  We present the architecture of a p2p backup system that uses pairwise
replication contracts between a data owner and a replicator. In contrast to
standard p2p storage systems using directly a DHT, the contracts allow our
system to optimize replicas' placement depending on a specific optimization
strategy, and so to take advantage of the heterogeneity of the machines and the
network. Such optimization is particularly appealing in the context of backup:
replicas can be geographically dispersed, the load sent over the network can be
minimized, or the optimization goal can be to minimize the backup/restore time.
However, managing the contracts, keeping them consistent and adjusting them in
response to dynamically changing environment is challenging.
  We built a scientific prototype and ran the experiments on 150 workstations
in the university's computer laboratories and, separately, on 50 PlanetLab
nodes. We found out that the main factor affecting the quality of the system is
the availability of the machines. Yet, our main conclusion is that it is
possible to build an efficient and reliable backup system on highly unreliable
machines (our computers had just 13% average availability).

altering the way deflection information is captured in a common Schlieren

how the interplay between active transport along a network and infinite

various scales. We find three regimes for steady state transport, corresponding
to the scale of the network, of individual segments or local to sites. At low
exchange rates strong density heterogeneities develop between different
segments in the network. In this regime one has to consider the topological
complexity of the whole network to describe transport. In contrast, at moderate
exchange rates the transport through the network decouples, and the physics is
determined by single segments and the local topology. At last, for very high
exchange rates the homogeneous Langmuir process dominates the stationary state.
We introduce effective rate diagrams for the network to identify these
different regimes. Based on this method we develop an intuitive but generic
picture of how the stationary state of excluded volume processes on complex
networks can be understood in terms of the single-segment phase diagram.

Series method offers that by approximating the unknown function based on $k$

consider series estimators for the conditional mean in light of: (i) sharp LLNs
for matrices derived from the noncommutative Khinchin inequalities, (ii) bounds
on the Lebesgue factor that controls the ratio between the $L^\infty$ and
$L_2$-norms of approximation errors, (iii) maximal inequalities for processes
whose entropy integrals diverge, and (iv) strong approximations to series-type
processes.
  These technical tools allow us to contribute to the series literature,
specifically the seminal work of Newey (1997), as follows. First, we weaken the
condition on the number $k$ of approximating functions used in series
estimation from the typical $k^2/n \to 0$ to $k/n \to 0$, up to log factors,
which was available only for spline series before. Second, we derive $L_2$
rates and pointwise central limit theorems results when the approximation error
vanishes. Under an incorrectly specified model, i.e. when the approximation
error does not vanish, analogous results are also shown. Third, under stronger
conditions we derive uniform rates and functional central limit theorems that
hold if the approximation error vanishes or not. That is, we derive the strong
approximation for the entire estimate of the nonparametric function.

bands for a wide collection of linear functionals of the conditional

non-axisymmetric perturbation [$\propto \exp(im\phi)$, $m=1,2..$] in the
vicinity of $r_0$ consisting of anticyclonic vortices which may facilitate
planetesimal growth in protoplanetary discs. Here, we analyze a continuum of
thin disc models ranging from self-gravitating to non-selfgravitating. The key
quantities determining the stability/instability are: (1) the parameters of the
bump (or depression) in the disc surface density, (2) the Toomre $Q$ parameter
of the disc (a non-self-gravitating disc has $Q\gg1$), and (3) the
dimensionless azimuthal wavenumber of the perturbation $\bar{k}_\phi =mQh/r_0$,
where $h$ is the half-thickness of the disc. For discs stable to axisymmetric
perturbations ($Q>1$), the self-gravity has a significant role for
$\bar{k}_\phi < \pi/2$ or $m<(\pi/2) (r_0/h)Q^{-1}$; instability may occur for
a depression or groove in the surface density if $Q\lesssim 2$. For
$\bar{k}_\phi > \pi/2$ the self-gravity is not important, and instability may
occur at a bump in the surface density. Thus, for all mode numbers $m \ge 1$,
the self-gravity is unimportant for $Q > (\pi/2)(r_0/h)$. We suggest that the
self-gravity be included in simulations for cases where $Q< (r_0/h)$.

lipid bilayer membranes. To achieve in simulations access to length-scales and
time-scales difficult to attain in fully atomistic molecular dynamics, these
coarse-grained models provide a reduced description of the molecular degrees of
freedom and often remove entirely representation of the solvent degrees of
freedom. In such implicit-solvent models the solvent contributions are treated
through effective interaction terms within an effective potential for the free
energy. For investigations of kinetics, Langevin dynamics is often used.
However, for many dynamical processes within bilayers this approach is
insufficient since it neglects important correlations and dynamical
contributions that are missing as a result of the momentum transfer that would
have occurred through the solvent. To address this issue, we introduce a new
thermostat based on fluctuating hydrodynamics for dynamic simulations of
implicit-solvent coarse-grained models. Our approach couples the coarse-grained
degrees of freedom to a stochastic continuum field that accounts for both the
solvent hydrodynamics and thermal fluctuations. We show our approach captures
important correlations in the dynamics of lipid bilayers that are missing in
simulations performed using conventional Langevin dynamics. For both planar

Galactic black hole candidate GRS 1915+105 just prior to (0 to 4 hours) and
during the brief (1 to 7 hour) ejection of major (superluminal) radio flares. A
very strong model independent correlation is found between the 1.2 keV - 12 keV
X-ray flux 0 to 4 hours before flare ejections with the peak optically thin 2.3
GHz emission of the flares. This suggests a direct physical connection between
the energy in the ejection and the luminosity of the accretion flow preceding
the ejection. In order to quantify this concept, we develop techniques to
estimate the intrinsic (unabsorbed) X-ray luminosity, $L_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}$,
from RXTE ASM data and to implement known methods to estimate the time averaged
power required to launch the radio emitting plasmoids, $Q$ (sometimes called
jet power). We find that the distribution of intrinsic luminosity from 1.2 keV
- 50 keV, $L_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}(1.2 - 50)$, is systematically elevated just
before ejections compared to arbitrary times when there are no major ejections.
The estimated $Q$ is strongly correlated with $L_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}(1.2 -
50)$ 0 to 4 hours before the ejection, the increase in
$L_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}(1.2 - 50)$ in the hours preceding the ejection and the
time averaged $L_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}(1.2 - 50)$ during the flare rise.
Furthermore, the total time averaged power during the ejection ($Q$ + the time
average of $L_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}(1.2 - 50)$ during ejection) is strongly
correlated with $L_{\mathrm{intrinsic}}(1.2 - 50)$ just before launch with near
equality if the distance to the source is $ \approx 10.5$ kpc.

probabilistic projections for the total fertility rate (TFR) using the Bayesian
hierarchical model of Alkema et al. (2011), which produces predictive
distributions of TFR for individual countries. The UN is interested in
publishing probabilistic projections for aggregates of countries, such as
regions and trading blocs. This requires joint probabilistic projections of
future country-specific TFRs, taking account of the correlations between them.
We propose an extension of the Bayesian hierarchical model that allows for
probabilistic projection of TFR for any set of countries. We model the
correlation between country forecast errors as a linear function of time
invariant covariates, namely whether the countries are contiguous, whether they
had a common colonizer after 1945, and whether they are in the same UN region.
The resulting correlation model is incorporated into the Bayesian hierarchical
model's error distribution. We produce predictive distributions of TFR for
1990-2010 for each of the UN's primary regions. We find that the proportions of
the observed values that fall within the prediction intervals from our method
are closer to their nominal levels than those produced by the current model.
Our results suggest that a significant proportion of the correlation between
forecast errors for TFR in different countries is due to countries' geographic
proximity to one another, and that if this correlation is accounted for, the
quality of probabilitistic projections of TFR for regions and other aggregates
is improved.

post-supernova hypercritical accretion to understand its effect on the magnetic
field of the new-born neutron star. We consider as an example the case of a
magnetic field loop protruding from the star's surface. The accreting matter is
assumed to be non magnetized and, due to the high accretion rate, matter
pressure dominates over magnetic pressure. We find that an accretion envelope
develops very rapidly and once it becomes convectively stable the magnetic
field is easily buried and pushed into the newly forming neutron star crust.
However, for low enough accretion rates the accretion envelope remains
convective for an extended period of time and only partial submergence of the
magnetic field occurs due to a residual field that is maintained at the
interface between the forming crust and the convective envelope. In this latter
case, the outcome should be a weakly magnetized neutron star with a likely
complicated field geometry. In our simulations we find the transition from
total to partial submergence to occur around dotM ~ 10 M_sun/yr. Back-diffusion
of the submerged magnetic field toward the surface, and the resulting growth of
the dipolar component, may result in a delayed switch-on of a pulsar on
time-scales of centuries to millenia.

theory, is the most fine-scaled approach to epistasis. Shapes, defined as
triangulations of polytopes for any number of loci, replace the well
established concepts of positive and negative epistasis for two mutations. From
the shape one can identify the fittest populations, i.e., populations where
allele shuffling (recombination) will not increase the mean fitness. Shapes and
graphs provide complementary information. The approaches make no structural
assumptions about the underlying fitness landscapes, which make them well
suited for empirical work.

successful approach for finding low-rank matrices that best fit the given data.
For example, for the problem of low-rank matrix completion, this method is
believed to be one of the most accurate and efficient, and formed a major
component of the winning entry in the Netflix Challenge.
  In the alternating minimization approach, the low-rank target matrix is
written in a bi-linear form, i.e. $X = UV^\dag$; the algorithm then alternates
between finding the best $U$ and the best $V$. Typically, each alternating step
in isolation is convex and tractable. However the overall problem becomes
non-convex and there has been almost no theoretical understanding of when this
approach yields a good result.
  In this paper we present first theoretical analysis of the performance of
alternating minimization for matrix completion, and the related problem of
matrix sensing. For both these problems, celebrated recent results have shown
that they become well-posed and tractable once certain (now standard)
conditions are imposed on the problem. We show that alternating minimization
also succeeds under similar conditions. Moreover, compared to existing results,
our paper shows that alternating minimization guarantees faster (in particular,
geometric) convergence to the true matrix, while allowing a simpler analysis.

evolution of a turbulent/diffusive accretion disc around an initially
unmagnetized star. The disc is initially threaded by a weak magnetic field
where the magnetic pressure is significantly less than the kinetic pressure in
the disc. The viscosity and magnetic diffusivity are modelled by two ""alpha""
parameters, while the coronal region above the disc is treated using ideal MHD.
The initial magnetic field is taken to consist of three poloidal field loops
threading the disc. The motivation for this study is to understand the
advection of disc matter and magnetic field by the turbulent/diffusive disc. At
early times the innermost field loop twists and its field lines become open.
The twisting of the opened field lines leads to the formation of both an inner
collimated, magnetically-dominated jet, and at larger distances from the axis a
matter dominated uncollimated wind. For later times, the strength of the
magnetic field decreases owing to field reconnection and annihilation in the
disc. For the early times, we have derived from the simulations both the matter
accretion speed in the disc and the accretion speed of the magnetic field. We
show that the derived matter accretion speed agrees approximately with the
predictions of a model where the accretion speed is the sum of two terms, one
due to the disc's viscosity (which gives a radial outflow of angular momentum
in the disc), and a second due to the twisted magnetic field at the disc's
surface (which gives a vertical outflow of angular momentum). For early times
we find that the magnetic contribution is roughly twice the viscous
contribution for the case where the alpha parameters are both equal to 0.1. At
later times the magnetic contribution to the matter speed becomes small
compared to the viscous contribution.

to notify the subjects of their selection, practical, error-free typing rates
as high as 12.75 character/min were achieved, which allowed subjects to
correctly type a 44-character sentence in less than 3.5 minutes. We hypothesize
that ITRs can be further improved by optimizing the parameters of the

shortening the selection notification time. These results provide compelling
evidence that the ITR limit of noninvasive BCIs has not yet been reached and
that further investigation into this matter is both justified and necessary.

in the Universe, as a complementary tool to SN Ia. The method is based on
determination of the size of the Broad Line Region from the emission line
delay, determination of the absolute monochromatic luminosity either from the
observed statistical relation or from a model of the formation of the Broad
Line Region, and determination of the observed monochromatic flux from
photometry. This allows to obtain the luminosity distance to a quasar
independently from its redshift. The accuracy of the measurements is however, a
key issue. We model the expected accuracy of the measurements by creating
artificial quasar monochromatic lightcurves and responses from the Broad Line
Region under various assumptions about the variability of a quasar, Broad Line
Region extension, distribution of the measurements in time, accuracy of the
measurements and the intrinsic line variability. We show that the five year
monitoring based on Mg II line should give the accuracy of 0.06 - 0.32
magnitude in the distance modulus which allows to put interesting constraints
on the cosmological models. Monitoring of higher redshift quasars based on CIV
lines is problematic due to much higher level of the intrinsic variability of
CIV in comparison with Mg II.

outflow driven by the young stellar objects in more evolved evolutionary phases
that are associated with ultracompact (B) or hypercompact (A1) HII regions. The
LVG analysis reveals high-density gas (10^3-10^4 cm-3), with well constrained
SiO column densities (0.5-1 10^15 cm-2). The driving source of the A2 outflow
is associated with typical hot core tracers such as methyl formate, vinyl
cyanide, cyanoacetilene, and acetone. The driving source of the main SiO
outflow in G24 has an estimated luminosity of a few 10^4 Lsun (typical of a
late O-type star) and is embedded in the 1.3 mm continuum core A2, which in
turn is located at the centre of a hot core that rotates on a plane
perpendicular to the outflow main axis. The present SiO images support a
scenario similar to the low-mass case for massive star formation, where jets
that are clearly traced by SiO emission, create outflows of swept-up ambient

Forte",,,,"hep-ph hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This thesis arises in the context of precision measurements at hadron
colliders. The Tevatron and the LHC provide very accurate measurements of many
Standard Model processes, such as the production of a lepton pair (Drell-Yan)
of high invariant mass. An accurate theoretical prediction of such processes is
crucial to be able to distinguish Standard Model physics from possible new
physics signals. QCD effects in the computation of the cross-sections at hadron
colliders are usually sizable; in particular, in some kinematical regimes they
behave in a non-perturbative way. In these cases the resummation of the whole
perturbative series is needed for accurate phenomenological predictions. In
this thesis the impact of threshold and high-energy resummations for the
production of high invariant mass systems (Drell-Yan, Higgs) are studied in
detail. In particular, in the threshold case a prescription to deal with the
divergent nature of the perturbative series based on Borel summation is
presented, and compared with the other prescriptions in the literature. Results
for the invariant mass distributions and rapidity distributions are presented.
The high-energy resummation formalism is reviewed and improved, and its impact
in phenomenological applications at hadron colliders is investigated. In
particular, a possible interaction between the two resummation regimes is
studied in some detail.

achievable channel capacity and the outage probability experienced at the
secondary system are obtained, revealing the impact of the average power
constraints on optimal power allocation in multi-user diversity technique in
fading environments with multiple secondary and primary receivers that share
the same channel. The obtained results highlight the advantage of having on one
hand more secondary receivers and on the other hand fewer primary receivers
manifested as an increase in the achievable capacity.

non-local, power-law hoppings and interactions. Choosing as a case study the
discrete nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation, we consider one-dimensional chains
with power-law decaying interactions (with exponent \alpha) and hoppings (with
exponent \beta): An extensive energy is obtained for \alpha, \beta>1. We show
that the effect of power-law interactions is that of shifting the onset of the
modulational instabilities region for \alpha>1. At a critical value of the
interaction strength, the modulational stable region shrinks to zero. Similar
results are found for effectively short-range nonlocal hoppings (\beta > 2): At
variance, for longer-ranged hoppings (1 < \beta < 2) there is no longer any
modulational stability. The hopping instability arises for q = 0 perturbations,
thus the system is most sensitive to the perturbations of the order of the
system's size. We also discuss the stability regions in the presence of the
interplay between competing interactions - (e.g., attractive local and
repulsive nonlocal interactions). We find that noncompeting nonlocal
interactions give rise to a modulational instability emerging for a perturbing
wave vector q = \pi while competing nonlocal interactions may induce a
modulational instability for a perturbing wave vector 0 < q < \pi. Since for
\alpha > 1 and \beta > 2 the effects are similar to the effect produced on the
stability phase diagram by finite range interactions and/or hoppings, we
conclude that the modulational instability is ""genuinely"" long-ranged for 1 <
\beta < 2 nonlocal hoppings.

splitter and enters into two perpendicular branches of length L, composed of
spin-orbit active materials (gate confined 2D electron gas). One of the
branches is connected to an electron reservoir that acts as a source of
decoherence by either behaving as a voltage probe or as a controlled source or
sink of current at fixed voltage. Such decoherence source is used to modify the
entropy of an unpolarized incoming state in order to generate electron
polarization at one or both output branches. The degree of entanglement of the
global state and the spin polarization is computed for the outgoing electrons
as a function of the coupling to the electron reservoir. Experimentally
available spin-orbit strength at the beam splitter arms, for arm lengths of a
few micrometers, is able to modulate spin polarization up to 80% in particular
spin axes proportional to the decoherence current. The Dresselhaus and Rashba
coefficients play a symmetric role in modulating the polarization.
Significantly less polarization is achieved for incoming mixed states due to
the local operation of the reservoir.

considered two mechanisms that might influence the observed radio emission:
free-free absorption and cyclotron resonance. Recently published results have
revealed a new aspect in pulsar radio spectra. There were found objects with
turnover at high frequencies in spectra, called gigahertz-peaked spectra (GPS)
pulsars. Most of them adjoin such interesting environments as HII regions or
compact pulsar wind nebulae (PWN). Thus, it is suggested that the turnover
phenomenon is associated with the environment than being related intrinsically
to the radio emission mechanism. Having noticed the apparent resemblance
between the B1259-63 spectrum and the GPS, we suggest that the same mechanisms
should be responsible for both cases. Therefore, the case of B1259-63 can be
treated as a key factor to explain the GPS phenomenon observed for the solitary
pulsars with interesting environments and also another types of spectra (e.g.
with break).

modern oncology that should ultimately lead to a personalised treatment.
High-throughput screenings of potentially active compounds against a panel of
genomically heterogeneous cancer cell lines have unveiled multiple
relationships between genomic alterations and drug responses. Various
computational approaches have been proposed to predict sensitivity based on
genomic features, while others have used the chemical properties of the drugs
to ascertain their effect. In an effort to integrate these complementary
approaches, we developed machine learning models to predict the response of
cancer cell lines to drug treatment, quantified through IC50 values, based on
both the genomic features of the cell lines and the chemical properties of the
considered drugs. Models predicted IC50 values in a 8-fold cross-validation and
an independent blind test with coefficient of determination R2 of 0.72 and 0.64
respectively. Furthermore, models were able to predict with comparable accuracy
(R2 of 0.61) IC50s of cell lines from a tissue not used in the training stage.
Our in silico models can be used to optimise the experimental design of
drug-cell screenings by estimating a large proportion of missing IC50 values
rather than experimentally measure them. The implications of our results go
beyond virtual drug screening design: potentially thousands of drugs could be
probed in silico to systematically test their potential efficacy as anti-tumour
agents based on their structure, thus providing a computational framework to
identify new drug repositioning opportunities as well as ultimately be useful
for personalized medicine by linking the genomic traits of patients to drug
sensitivity.

Early redshifts z ~ 20 have become observationally promising as a result of a
recently recognized effect of a supersonic relative velocity between the dark
matter and gas. This effect produces prominent structure on 100 comoving Mpc
scales, which makes it much more feasible to detect 21-cm fluctuations from the
epoch of first heating. We use semi-numerical hybrid methods to follow for the
first time the joint evolution of the X-ray and Lyman-Werner radiative
backgrounds, including the effect of the supersonic streaming velocity on the
cosmic distribution of stars. We incorporate self-consistently the negative
feedback on star formation induced by the Lyman-Werner radiation, which
dissociates molecular hydrogen and thus suppresses gas cooling. We find that
the feedback delays the X-ray heating transition by a Delta z ~ 2, but leaves a
promisingly large fluctuation signal over a broad redshift range. The
large-scale power spectrum is predicted to reach a maximal signal-to-noise
ratio of S/N ~ 3-4 at z ~ 18 (for a projected first-generation instrument),
with S/N > 1 out to z ~ 22-23. We hope to stimulate additional numerical
simulations as well as observational efforts focused on the epoch prior to

lightest neutralino can act as a cold dark matter candidate in a relatively
wide parameter range. In this range, the lightest neutralino relic abundance is
drastically reduced mainly by stau-antistau coannihilations and, thus, the
upper bound on this abundance from cold dark matter considerations becomes
compatible with the recent data on the branching ratio of B_s --> mu^+mu^-.
Also, masses for the lightest neutral CP-even Higgs boson about (125-126) GeV,
favored by LHC, can be easily accommodated. The mass of the lightest
neutralino, though, comes out large (~1 TeV).

implying that these planets are also old, formed in the early Universe. The
canonical theory suggests that the conditions for their formation could not
have existed at such early epochs. In this paper we argue that the required
conditions, such as sufficiently high dust-to-gas ratio, could in fact have
existed in the early Universe immediately following the first episode of metal
production in Pop. III stars, both in metal-enhanced and metal-deficient
environments. Metal-rich regions may have existed in multiple isolated pockets
of enriched and weakly-mixed gas close to the massive Pop. III stars.
Observations of quasars at redshifts $z\sim 5$, and gamma-ray bursts at $z\sim
6$, show a very wide spread of metals in absorption from $\rm [X/H]\simeq -3$
to $\simeq -0.5$. This suggests that physical conditions in the metal-abundant
clumps could have been similar to where protoplanets form today. However,
planets could have formed even in low-metallicity environments, where formation
of stars is expected to proceed due to lower opacity at higher densities. In
such cases, the circumstellar accretion disks are expected to rotate faster
than their high-metallicity analogues. This can result in the enhancement of
dust particles at the disk periphery, where they can coagulate and start
forming planetesimals. In conditions with the low initial specific angular
momentum, radiation from the central protostar can act as a trigger to drive
instabilities with masses in the Earth to Jupiter mass range. Discoveries of
planets around old metal-poor stars (e.g. HIP 11952, $\rm [Fe/H]\sim -1.95$)
show that planets did indeed form in the early Universe and this may require
modification of our understanding of the physical processes that produce them.
This work is an attempt to provide a heuristic scenario for their existence.

may not be formed in a flat background in 4 dimensions. The study extends to
the thermodynamical properties of the objects that are created, which exhibit a
universal behavior in their entropy, and, suggests the elimination of the
possibility in observing black holes (BHs) at the LHC in the absence of extra
dimensions. On the other hand, including extra dimensions, and assuming that
the matter is localized (dense) enough in those directions, opens new avenues
in creating BHs at energies of the order of TeV. The investigation is carried
further to $AdS_5$ backgrounds and makes connections with the implications for
the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in heavy ion collisions. In particular,
classes of the geometries found suggest that a BH is formed if and only if the
(central collision) energy is sufficiently large compared to the transverse
scale of the corresponding gauge theory side stress-tensor. This implies that
when the scattering in the gravity description is mapped onto a heavy ion
collision problem yields a result, which is in accordance with the current
intuition and data: QGP is formed only at high enough energies compared to
$\Lambda_{QCD}$, even for central processes. Incorporating weak coupling
physics and in particular the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) model, a
satisfactory fitting with the RHIC and the LHC data for multiplicities may be

subdomain of $\R^d$) of the form $e^{\gamma X(x)} dx$, where $X$ is a
log-correlated Gaussian field and $\gamma \in [0,\sqrt{2d})$ is a fixed

oscillates between $-\infty$ and $\infty$ and is not a function in the usual
sense. This procedure yields the zero measure when $\gamma=\sqrt{2d}$.
  Two methods have been proposed to produce a non-trivial measure when
$\gamma=\sqrt{2d}$. The first involves taking a derivative at
$\gamma=\sqrt{2d}$ (and was studied in an earlier paper by the current
authors), while the second involves a modified renormalization scheme. We show
here that the two constructions are equivalent and use this fact to deduce
several quantitative properties of the random measure. In particular, we
complete the study of the moments of the derivative multiplicative chaos, which
allows us to establish the KPZ formula at criticality. The case of
two-dimensional (massless or massive) Gaussian free fields is also covered.

Finally, we apply the FitSKIRT code to a V-band image of the edge-on spiral
galaxy NGC4013. This galaxy has been modeled previously by other authors using
different combinations of radiative transfer codes and optimization methods.
Given the different models and techniques and the complexity and degeneracies
in the parameter space, we find reasonable agreement between the different
models. We conclude that the FitSKIRT method allows comparison between
different models and geometries in a quantitative manner and minimizes the need
of human intervention and biasing. The high level of automation makes it an
ideal tool to use on larger sets of observed data.

few such coronae have been detected so far. In this paper, we study the hot
X-ray coronae beyond the optical disks of two normal massive spirals, NGC1961
and NGC6753. Based on XMM-Newton X-ray observations, hot gaseous emission is
detected to ~60 kpc - well beyond their optical radii. The hot gas has a
best-fit temperature of kT~0.6 keV and an abundance of ~0.1 Solar, and exhibits
a fairly uniform distribution, suggesting that the quasi-static gas resides in
hydrostatic equilibrium in the potential well of the galaxies. The bolometric
luminosity of the gas in the (0.05-0.15)r_200 region (r_200 is the virial
radius) is ~6e40 erg/s for both galaxies. The baryon mass fractions of NGC1961

hot coronae around NGC1961 and NGC6753 offer an excellent basis to probe

with the moving mesh code Arepo and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code
Gadget. Although neither model gives a perfect description, the observed
luminosities, gas masses, and abundances favor the Arepo code. Moreover, the
shape and the normalization of the observed density profiles are better
reproduced by Arepo within ~0.5r_200. However, neither model incorporates
efficient feedback from supermassive black holes or supernovae, which could
alter the simulated properties of the X-ray coronae. With the further advance
of numerical models, the present observations will be essential in constraining
the feedback effects in structure formation simulations.

find that the gas in clusters is generically not isothermal, and that the
temperature declines with radius at large distances from the cluster center
(outside the core- and scale radii). This temperature profile is determined by
the accretion history of the halo, and is not quantitatively well-described by
a polytropic model. We explain quantitatively how the large-scale temperature
gradient persists in spite of thermal conduction and convection. These results
are a consequence of the cosmological assembly of clusters and cannot be
reproduced with non-cosmological simulations of isolated halos. We show that
the variation in halo assembly histories produces a ~10% scatter in temperature
at fixed mass. On top of this scatter, conduction decreases the temperature of
the gas near the scale radius in massive clusters, which may bias hydrostatic
mass estimates inferred from x-ray and SZ observations. As an example
application of our model profiles, we use mixing-length theory to estimate the
turbulent pressure support created by the magnetothermal instability (MTI): in
agreement with our earlier MHD simulations, we find that the convection
produced by the MTI can provide ~5% non-thermal pressure support near r_500.
The magnitude of this turbulent pressure support is likely to be non-monotonic
in halo mass, peaking in ~10^14.5 M_sun halos.

throughout the blue cloud and green valley at a given stellar mass, and are
much rarer in quiescent (red sequence) galaxies. This is in contrast to the
published host galaxy properties of weaker narrow-line AGNs, indicating that
broad-line AGNs occur during a different phase in galaxy evolution. More
luminous broad-line AGNs have bluer host galaxies, even at fixed mass,
suggesting that the same processes that fuel nuclear activity also efficiently

matter. The evolution of these fields around curved spacetimes is poorly
understood but is expected to display interesting effects. In particular, the
interaction of light bosonic fields with supermassive black holes, key players
in most galaxies, could provide colourful examples of superradiance and
nonlinear bosenova-like collapse. In turn, the observation of spinning black
holes is expected to impose stringent bounds on the mass of putative massive
bosonic fields in our universe. Our purpose here is to present a comprehensive
study of the evolution of linearized massive scalar and vector fields in the
vicinities of rotating black holes. For a certain boson field mass range, the
field can become trapped in a potential barrier outside the horizon and
transition to a bound state. Because there are a number of such quasi-bound
states, the generic outcome is an amplitude modulated sinusoidal, or beating,
signal. We believe that the appearance of such beatings has gone unnoticed in
the past, and in fact mistaken for exponential growth. The amplitude modulation
of the signal depends strongly on the relative excitation of the overtones,
which in turn is strongly tied to the bound-state geography. For the first time
we explore massive vector fields in generic BH background which are hard, if
not impossible, to separate in the Kerr background. Our results show that

present and analyse high resolution (R ~ 30,000) near-infrared 2.3 micron
spectra of 20 massive young stellar objects from the RMS database, in the
largest such study of CO first overtone bandhead emission to date. We fit the
emission under the assumption it originates from a circumstellar disc in
Keplerian rotation. We explore three approaches to modelling the physical
conditions within the disc - a disc heated mainly via irradiation from the
central star, a disc heated mainly via viscosity, and a disc in which the
temperature and density are described analytically. We find that the models
described by heating mechanisms are inappropriate because they do not provide
good fits to the CO emission spectra. We therefore restrict our analysis to the
analytic model, and obtain good fits to all objects that possess sufficiently
strong CO emission, suggesting circumstellar discs are the source of this
emission. On average, the temperature and density structure of the discs
correspond to geometrically thin discs, spread across a wide range of
inclinations. Essentially all the discs are located within the dust sublimation
radius, providing strong evidence that the CO emission originates close to the
central protostar, on astronomical unit scales. In addition, we show that the
objects in our sample appear no different to the general population of MYSOs in
the RMS database, based on their near- and mid-infrared colours. The
combination of observations of a large sample of MYSOs with CO bandhead
emission and our detailed modelling provide compelling evidence of the presence
of small scale gaseous discs around such objects, supporting the scenario in
which massive stars form via disc accretion.

number of electrons per unit cell and spin projection -- is an integer. At
fractional filling, an insulating phase that preserves all symmetries is a Mott
insulator, i.e. it is either gapless or, if gapped, displays fractionalized
excitations and topological order. We raise the inverse question -- at an
integer filling is a band insulator always possible? Here we show that lattice
symmetries may forbid a band insulator even at certain integer fillings, if the
crystal is non-symmorphic -- a property shared by a majority of
three-dimensional crystal structures. In these cases, one may infer the
existence of topological order if the ground state is gapped and fully
symmetric. This is demonstrated using a non-perturbative flux threading
argument, which has immediate applications to quantum spin systems and bosonic
insulators in addition to electronic band structures in the absence of
spin-orbit interactions.

(T ~ 10^{4 - 5} K), metal-enriched CGM. The detection rates and column
densities derived for these metal lines decrease with increasing impact
parameter, a trend we interpret as a declining metal surface density profile
for the CGM. A comparison of the relative column densities of adjacent
ionization states indicates the gas is predominantly ionized. The large surface
density in metals demands a large reservoir of metals and gas in the cool CGM
(very conservatively, M_ CGMcool > 10^9 MSun), which likely traces a distinct
density and/or temperature regime from the highly-ionized CGM traced by OVI
absorption. The large dispersion in absorption strengths (including
non-detections) suggests the cool CGM traces a wide range of densities or a mix
of local ionizing conditions. Lastly, the kinematics inferred from the
metal-line profiles are consistent with the cool CGM being bound to the dark
matters halos hosting the galaxies; this gas may serve as fuel for future
star-formation. Future work will leverage this dataset to provide estimates on
the mass, metallicity, dynamics, and origin of the cool CGM in low-z, L*

generate a deeper catalog than DAOPHOT. Moreover, the use of neural networks
for object classification plus the novel SPREAD\_MODEL parameter push down to
the limiting magnitude the possibility of star/galaxy separation. DAOPHOT and
ALLSTAR provide an optimal solution for point-source photometry in stellar
fields and very accurate and reliable PSF photometry, with robust star-galaxy
separation. However, they are not useful for galaxy characterization, and do
not generate catalogs that are very complete for faint sources. On the other
hand, SExtractor, along with the new capability to derive PSF photometry, turns
to be competitive and returns accurate photometry also for galaxies. We can
assess that the new version of SExtractor, used in conjunction with PSFEx,
represents a very powerful software package for source extraction with
performances comparable to those of DAOPHOT. Finally, by comparing the results

we consider an \textit{extreme} case, in which an $I$ simply cuts one of its
links at random when chosen for updating, while an $E$ adds a link to a random
unconnected individual (node). The model has only two control parameters,
namely, the number of nodes in each group, $N_{I}$ and $N_{E}$). In the steady
state, only the number of crosslinks between the two groups fluctuates, with
remarkable properties: Its average ($X$) remains very close to 0 for all
$N_{I}>N_{E}$ or near its maximum ($\mathcal{N}\equiv N_{I}N_{E}$) if
$N_{I}<N_{E}$. At the transition ($N_{I}=N_{E}$), the fraction $X/\mathcal{N}$
wanders across a substantial part of $[0,1]$, much like a pure random walk.
Mapping this system to an Ising model with spin-flip dynamics and unusual
long-range interactions, we note that such fluctuations are far greater than
those displayed in either first or second order transitions of the latter.
Thus, we refer to the case here as an `extraordinary transition.' Thanks to the
restoration of detailed balance and the existence of a `Hamiltonian,' several
qualitative aspects of these remarkable phenomena can be understood

dissipation in the jet which may explain the enhanced synchrotron radiation in
the knots of the 3C 303 jet, and also in the apparently stationary knot HST-1
in the jet near the nucleus of the nearby galaxy M87. For a relativistic
Poynting jet on parsec scales, the reflected voltage wave from an inductive
termination or load can lead to a backward propagating wave which breaks down
the magnetic insulation of the jet giving $|{\bf E}| /|{\bf B}|\geq 1$. At the
threshold for breakdown, $|{\bf E}|/|{\bf B}|=1$, positive and negative
particles are directly accelerated in the ${\bf E \times B}$ direction which is
approximately along the jet axis. Acceleration can occur up to Lorentz factors
$\sim 10^7$. This particle acceleration mechanism is distinct from that in
shock waves and that in magnetic field reconnection.

the identification of three types of global modes in the boundary layer. We
derive dispersion relations for each of these modes that accurately capture the

that angular momentum transport in the boundary layer is intrinsically
nonlocal, and is driven by radiation of angular momentum away from the boundary

transport in the boundary layer by waves that can travel large distances before
dissipating and redistributing angular momentum and energy to the disk and star

because one major source of error could not be estimated the true percent

to determine the contribution of mRNA levels to protein expression. We show
that the variance in translation rates directly measured by ribosome profiling

constraints of a high color temperature and a small silicate-feature strength,
dust particles ejected from the surface of comet 9P/Tempel 1 are likely compact

of gapped Z2 spin liquids, such that two phases in different symmetry classes

Symmetry classes are defined by specifying a fractionalization class for each
type of anyon. The fusion rules of anyons play a crucial role in determining
the symmetry classes. For translation and internal symmetry, braiding
statistics plays no role, but can affect the classification when point group
symmetries are present. For square lattice space group, time reversal and SO(3)
spin rotation symmetry, we find 2,098,176 ~ 2^21 distinct symmetry classes. We
give an explicit construction of symmetry classes for square lattice space
group symmetry in the toric code model. Via simple examples, we illustrate how
information about fractionalization classes can in principle be obtained from
the spectrum and quantum numbers of excited states. Moreover, the symmetry
class can be partially determined from the quantum numbers of the four
degenerate ground states on the torus. We also extend our results to arbitrary
Abelian topological orders, and compare our classification with the related
projective symmetry group classification of parton mean-field theories. Our
results provide a framework for understanding and probing the sharp

+1/2, respectively. For helical magnetic fields, energy and correlation length
scale as conformal time to the powers -1/3 and +2/3, respectively. The
universal decay law of the magnetic field implies that the strength of magnetic
field generated during the QCD phase transition could reach $\sim 10^{-9}$\,G

irregular satellite. Although the capture origin of irregular satellites has
been widely accepted, several previous studies suggest that Nereid was formed
in the circumplanetary disk of Neptune and was ejected outward to the present
location by Triton. Our time-series photometric observations confirm that the
spin is stable and non-chaotic with a period of 11.5 hr as indicated by Grav et
al. (2003). The optical colors of Nereid are indistinguishable from those of
trans-Neptunian objects and Centaurs, especially those with neutral colors. We
also find the consistency of Nereid's rotation with the size-rotation
distribution of small outer bodies. It is more likely that Nereid originates in
an immigrant body captured from a heliocentric orbit which was 4-5 AU away from
Neptune's orbit.

giant members of the Bo\""{o}tes I ultra-faint dwarf spheroidal galaxy,
complemented with re-analysis of a similar spectrum of an eighth member star.
The stars cover [Fe/H] from -3.7 to -1.9, and include a CEMP-no star with
[Fe/H] = -3.33. We conclude from our chemical abundance data that Bo\""{o}tes I
has evolved as a self-enriching star-forming system, from essentially
primordial initial abundances. This allows us uniquely to investigate the place
of CEMP-no stars in a chemically evolving system, in addition to limiting the
timescale of star formation. The elemental abundances are formally consistent
with a halo-like distribution, with enhanced mean [alpha/Fe] and small scatter
about the mean. This is in accord with the high-mass stellar IMF in this
low-stellar-density, low-metallicity system being indistinguishable from the
present-day solar neighborhood value. There is a non-significant hint of a
decline in [alpha/Fe] with [Fe/H]; together with the low scatter, this requires
low star formation rates, allowing time for SNe ejecta to be mixed over the
large spatial scales of interest. One star has very high [Ti/Fe], but we do not
confirm a previously published high value of [Mg/Fe] for another star. We
discuss the existence of CEMP-no stars, and the absence of any stars with lower
CEMP-no enhancements at higher [Fe/H], a situation which is consistent with
knowledge of CEMP-no stars in the Galactic field. We show that this observation
requires there be two enrichment paths at very low metallicities: CEMP-no and
""carbon-normal"".

extensive air shower (EAS) arrays is the mass composition of ultra-high energy
cosmic rays (UHECRs). A new approach to the problem is presented, combining
analysis of arrival directions with the statistical test of the paired EAS
samples. An idea of the method is to search for possible correlations of UHECR
masses with their separate sources, for instance, if there are two sources in
different areas of the celestial sphere injecting different nuclei, but fluxes
are comparable so that arrival directions are isotropic, the aim is to reveal a
difference in the mass composition of CR fluxes. The method is based on a
non-parametric statistical test -- the Wilcoxon signed-rank routine -- which
does not depend on the populations fitting any parameterized distributions. Two
particular algorithms are proposed: first, using measurements of the depth of
EAS maximum position in the atmosphere; and second, relying on the age variance
of air showers initiated by different primary particles. The formulated method
is applied to the Yakutsk array data, in order to demonstrate the possibility
of searching for a difference in average mass composition of the two UHECR
sets, arriving particularly from the supergalactic plane and a complementary
region.

  Simulation of these correlated fields can be done in a single pass instead of
relying on multi-pass convergent methods like the Gibbs Sampler or other Markov
Chain Monte Carlo methods. The fields are constructed directly from specified
marginal probability mass functions and covariances between nearby sites.
  The proposition on which the construction is based establishes when and how
it is possible to simplify the conditional probabilities of each site given the
other sites in a manner that makes simulation quite feasible yet maintains
desired marginal probabilities and covariances between sites.
  Special cases of these correlated fields have been deployed successfully in
data authentication, object detection and image generation. The limitations
that must be imposed on the covariances and marginal probabilities in order for
the algorithm to work are studied. What's more, a necessary and sufficient
condition that guarantees the permutation property of correlated random fields
are investigated. In particular, Markov random fields as a subclass of
correlated random fields are derived by a general and natural condition.
Consequently, a direct and flexible single pass algorithm for simulating Markov

dimensionality expansion, random noise injection, and random projection, to
provide strong resilience to attacks on the perturbed data and queries. It also
preserves multidimensional ranges, which allows existing indexing techniques to
be applied to speedup range query processing. The kNN-R algorithm is designed
to work with the RASP range query algorithm to process the kNN queries. We have
carefully analyzed the attacks on data and queries under a precisely defined
threat model and realistic security assumptions. Extensive experiments have

safety and non-safety applications in next generation Intelligent
Transportation Systems. Due to relatively low heights of the antennas, V2V
communication is often influenced by topographic features, man-made structures,
and other vehicles located between the communicating vehicles. On highways, it
was shown experimentally that vehicles can obstruct the line of sight (LOS)
communication up to 50 percent of the time; furthermore, a single obstructing
vehicle can reduce the power at the receiver by more than 20 dB. Based on both
experimental measurements and simulations performed using a validated channel
model, we show that the elevated position of antennas on tall vehicles improves
communication performance. Tall vehicles can significantly increase the
effective communication range, with an improvement of up to 50 percent in
certain scenarios. Using these findings, we propose a new V2V relaying scheme
called Tall Vehicle Relaying (TVR) that takes advantage of better channel
characteristics provided by tall vehicles. TVR distinguishes between tall and
short vehicles and, where appropriate, chooses tall vehicles as next hop
relays. We investigate TVR's system-level performance through a combination of

fundamental mode of processing in the visual pathway. Spatial frequency (SF)
tuning, arguably the most fundamental feature of spatial vision, provides
particular intuition within the coarse-to-fine framework: low spatial
frequencies convey global information about an image (e.g., general
orientation), while high spatial frequencies carry more detailed information
(e.g., edges). In this paper, we study the development of cortical spatial
frequency tuning. As feedforward input from the lateral geniculate nucleus
(LGN) has been shown to have significant influence on cortical coarse-to-fine
processing, we present a firing-rate based thalamocortical model which includes
both feedforward and feedback components. We analyze the relationship between
various model parameters (including cortical feedback strength) and responses.
We confirm the importance of the antagonistic relationship between the center
and surround responses in thalamic relay cell receptive fields (RFs), and
further characterize how specific structural LGN RF parameters affect cortical
coarse-to-fine processing. Our results also indicate that the effect of
cortical feedback on spatial frequency tuning is age-dependent: in particular,
cortical feedback more strongly affects coarse-to-fine processing in kittens
than in adults. We use our results to propose an experimentally testable
hypothesis for the function of the extensive feedback in the corticothalamic
circuit.

the stellar interiors. They have been observed during years to decades thanks
to the measurement of stellar magnetic proxies at the surface of the stars such

field with spectropolarimetry. However, all of these measurements rely on
external features that cannot be visible during for example, a Maunder-type
minimum. With the advent of long observations provided by space asteroseismic
missions, it has been possible to pierce inside the stars and study their
properties. Moreover, the acoustic-mode properties are also perturbed by the
presence of these dynamos. We track the temporal variations of the amplitudes
and frequencies of acoustic modes allowing us to search for signature of
magnetic activity cycles, as has already been done in the Sun and in the CoRoT
target HD49933. We use asteroseimic tools and more classical spectroscopic
measurements performed with the NARVAL spectropolarimeter to check if there are
hints of any activity cycle in three solar-like stars observed continuously by
the CoRoT satellite: HD49385, HD181420, and HD52265.Our analysis gives very
small variation of the seismic parameters preventing us from detecting any
magnetic modulation. However we are able to provide a lower limit of any
magnetic-activity change in the three stars that should be longer than 120
days, which is the length of the time series. Moreover we computed the upper
limit for the line-of-sight magnetic field component. More seismic and

This indicates that, for screening important variables, we could follow a

better model fitting. To seek such a better subset, we consider the
optimization problem associated with best subset regression. An EM algorithm,
called orthogonalizing subset screening, and its accelerating version are
proposed for searching for the best subset. Although the two algorithms cannot
guarantee that a subset they yield is the best, their monotonicity property
makes the subset have better model fitting than initial subsets generated by
popular screening methods, and thus the subset can have better screening
performance asymptotically. Simulation results show that our methods are very
competitive in high dimensional variable screening even for finite sample

  maximum independent set problems for randomly generated rectangles",,,,,"cs.CG cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a set ${\cal R}=\{R_1,R_2,..., R_n\}$ of $n$ randomly positioned axis
parallel rectangles in 2D, the problem of computing the minimum clique cover
(MCC) and maximum independent set (MIS) for the intersection graph $G({\cal
R})$ of the members in $\cal R$ are both computationally hard \cite{CC05}. For
the MCC problem, it is proved that polynomial time constant factor
approximation is impossible to obtain \cite{PT11}. Though such a result is not
proved yet for the MIS problem, no polynomial time constant factor
approximation algorithm exists in the literature. We study the performance of
greedy algorithms for computing these two parameters of $G({\cal R})$.
Experimental results shows that for each of the MCC and MIS problems, the
corresponding greedy algorithm produces a solution that is very close to its
optimum solution. Scheinerman \cite{Scheinerman80} showed that the size of MIS
is tightly bounded by $\sqrt{n}$ for a random instance of the 1D version of the
problem, (i.e., for the interval graph). Our experiment shows that the size of
independent set and the clique cover produced by the greedy algorithm is at
least $2\sqrt{n}$ and at most $3\sqrt{n}$, respectively. Thus the
experimentally obtained approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for MIS
problem is at most 3/2 and the same for the MCC problem is at least 2/3.
Finally we will provide refined greedy algorithms based on a concept of {\it
simplicial rectangle}. The characteristics of this algorithm may be of interest
in getting a provably constant factor approximation algorithm for random
instance of both the problems. We believe that the result also holds true for
any finite dimension.

Array (SMA) in both the subcompact (SMA-SubC) and extended (SMA-Ext)
configurations at a wavelength of 870 micron. W51 North is resolved into four
cores (SMA1 to SMA4) in the 870 micron continuum image. The associated dust
polarization exhibits more complex structures than seen at lower angular
resolution. We analyze the inferred morphologies of the plane-of-sky magnetic
field (B_bot) in the SMA1 to SMA4 cores and in the envelope using the SMA-Ext
and SMA-SubC data. These results are compared with the B_bot archive images
obtained from the CSO and JCMT. A correlation between dust intensity gradient
position angles (phi_{nabla I}) and magnetic field position angles (phi_B) is
found in the CSO, JCMT and both SMA data sets. This correlation is further
analyzed quantitatively. A systematically tighter correlation between
phi_{nabla I} and phi_B is found in the cores, whereas the correlation
decreases in outside-core regions. Magnetic field-to-gravity force ratio
(Sigma_B) maps are derived using the newly developed polarization - intensity
gradient method by Koch, Tang & Ho 2012. We find that the force ratios tend to
be small (Sigma_B <= 0.5) in the cores in all 4 data sets. In regions outside
of the cores, the ratios increase or the field is even dominating gravity
(Sigma_B > 1). This possibly provides a physical explanation of the tightening
correlation between phi_{nabla I} and phi_B in the cores: the more the B field
lines are dragged and aligned by gravity, the tighter the correlation is.
Finally, we propose a schematic scenario for the magnetic field in W51 North to
interpret the four polarization observations at different physical scales.

genetics and molecular biology of plants. Its highly selfing nature, together
with other important features, such as small size, short generation time, small
genome size, and wide geographic distribution, make it an ideal model organism
for understanding natural variation. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have proven a useful technique for identifying genetic loci responsible for
natural variation in A. thaliana. Previously genotyped accessions (natural
inbred lines) can be grown in replicate under different conditions, and
phenotyped for different traits. These important features greatly simplify
association mapping of traits and allow for systematic dissection of the
genetics of natural variation by the entire Arabidopsis community. To
facilitate this, we present GWAPP, an interactive web-based application for
conducting GWAS in A. thaliana. Using an efficient Python implementation of a
linear mixed model, traits measured for a subset of 1386 publicly available
ecotypes can be uploaded and mapped with an efficient mixed model and other
methods in just a couple of minutes. GWAPP features an extensive, interactive,
and a user-friendly interface that includes interactive manhattan plots and
interactive local and genome-wide LD plots. It facilitates exploratory data
analysis by implementing features such as the inclusion of candidate SNPs in

undergoes a spectrum evolution due to orbital motion. We proposed a qualitative
model which explains this evolution. We considered two mechanisms that might
influence the observed radio emission: free-free absorption and cyclotron
resonance. According to published results \citep{kijak2011a}, there were found
objects with a new type of pulsar radio spectra, called gigahertz-peaked
spectra (GPS) pulsars. Most of them were found to exist in very interesting
environments. Therefore, it is suggested that the turnover phenomenon is
associated with the environment than being related intrinsically to the radio
emission mechanism. Having noticed the apparent resemblance between the
B1259-63 spectrum and the GPS, we suggested that the same mechanisms should be
responsible for both cases. Thus, we believe that this binary system can hold
the clue to the understanding of gigahertz-peaked spectra of isolated pulsars.
Using the same database we constructed spectra for chosen observing days and
obtained different types of spectra. Comparing to current classification of
pulsar spectra, there occurs a suggestion that the appearance of various
spectra shapes, different from a simple power law which is typical for radio
pulsars, is possibly caused by environmental conditions around neutron stars.

radio galaxies on their luminosities and redshifts. Because of a very strong
redshift-luminosity correlation (Malmquist bias) in a flux-limited sample, any
redshift-dependent effect could appear as a luminosity related effect and vice
versa. A question could then arise - do all the morphological differences seen
in the two classes (FR 1 and 2 types) of sources, usually attributed to the
differences in their luminosities, could as well be primarily a
redshift-dependent effect? A sharp break in luminosity, seen among the two
classes, could after all reflect a sharp redshift-dependence due to a rather
critical ambient density value at some cosmic epoch. A doubt on these lines
does not seem to have been raised in past and things have never been examined
with this particular aspect in mind. We want to ascertain the customary
prevalent view in the literature that the systematic differences in the two
broad morphology types of FR 1 and 2 radio galaxies are indeed due to the
differences in their luminosities, and not due to a change in redshift. Here we
investigate the dependence of FR 1/2 dichotomy of radio galaxies on luminosity
and redshift by using the 3CR sample, where the FR 1/2 dichotomy was first
seen, supplemented by data from an additional sample (MRC), that goes about a
factor of 5 or more deeper in flux-density than the original 3CR sample. This
lets us compare sources with similar luminosities but at different redshifts as
well as examine sources at similar redshifts but with different luminosities,
thereby allowing us a successful separation of the otherwise two intricately
entangled effects. We find that the morphology type is not directly related to
redshift and the break between the two types of morphologies seems to depend
only upon the radio luminosity.

cluster of galaxies that is initially in the virial equilibrium state, and then
undergoes radiative cooling. The initial gas profile is derived under the
assumption that the gas is hydrostatic within the dark-matter potential
presented by the NFW or King model, and has a polytropic profile. The
contribution of masses of gas and galaxies to the potential in the calculation
is ignored compared to the dark matter. The temperature and density profiles of
gas in its quasi-hydrostatic cooling phase, which is expected to last for ~Gyr,
is then calculated for different initial gas profiles. It is found that in the
quasi-hydrostatic cooling phase, while the temperature decreases to about 1/3,
the density increases by a factor of 4-6 at the cluster center in comparison
with their initial polytropic values, though the profiles over the core depend
on the dark-matter potential. Hence, the core radius in the quasi-hydrostatic
cooling gas appears to be smaller than that in the initial polytropic gas. We
compared the density profile of the cool core with observations to find that,
while the initial density is around the upper bounds of large-core (>100 kpc)
clusters, most likely relaxed, but the cooling is not yet significant, the
central density under quasi-hydrostatic cooling falls between the mid- and
high-values of small (<100 kpc)- or cool-core clusters. It is also found for
the quasi-hydrostatic cooling gas that the entropy profile roughly agrees with
the best-fit model to the ACCEPT sample with a low central entropy; also, the
pressure gradient in the inner core is close to that of the REXCESS sample.
X-ray surface brightness calculated for the quasi-hydrostatic cooling gas is
well represented by the conventional double beta-model, giving a physical basis
for applying the double beta-model to cool-core clusters.

populations in dwarf galaxies in the context of the tidal stirring scenario for
the formation of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies in the Local Group. The dwarf
galaxies, initially composed of a stellar disk and a dark matter halo, are
placed on seven different orbits around the Milky Way. The stars are divided
into two populations, within and outside the half-light radius, and their
positions are followed for 10 Gyr. We find that the populations retain
different density distributions even over such long timescales. Some of the
stars of the outer population migrate to the central part of the dwarf forming
an extended core while the stars of the inner population develop a tail in the
outer parts. In addition, the outer population is more heavily stripped by
tidal forces from the Milky Way and may become subdominant at all radii on
tight enough orbits. We conclude that the tidal stirring model is fully
compatible with the presence of multiple stellar populations in dSph galaxies.

the kinematical variables describing the elastic $ep$ scattering are moderately

we use the QCD factorization approach formulated in the framework of the
soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). Such technique allows us to develop a
description for the soft-spectator scattering contribution which is found to be
important in the region of moderately large scales.
  Together with the hard-spectator contribution we present the complete
factorization formulas for the TPE amplitudes at the leading power and leading
logarithmic accuracy. The momentum region where both photons are hard is
described by only one new nonperturbative SCET form factor. It turns out that
the same form factor also arises for wide-angle Compton scattering which is
also described in the framework of the SCET approach. This allows us to
estimate the soft-spectator contribution associated with the hard photons in a
model independent way.
  The main unknown in our description of the TPE contribution is related with
the configuration where one photon is soft. The nonperturbative dynamics in
this case is described by two unknown SCET amplitudes. We use a simple model in
order to estimate their contribution.
  The formalism is then applied to a phenomenological analysis of existing data
for the reduced cross section as well as for the transverse and longitudinal
polarization observables.

basis of only two natural hypotheses. One is that societies want to survive,
the second, that individuals in a society would, in general, like to increase
their standard of living. We start by presenting a mathematical model, which
may be seen as a particular type of a controlled branching process. All
conditions of the model are justified and interpreted. After several
preliminary results about societies in general we can show that two society
forms should attract particular attention, both from a qualitative and a
quantitative point of view. These are the so-called weakest-first society and
the strongest-first society. In particular we prove then that these two
societies stand out since they form an envelope of all possible societies in a
sense we will make precise. This result (the envelopment theorem) is seen as
significant because it is paralleled with precise survival criteria for the
enveloping societies. Moreover, given that one of the ""limiting"" societies can
be seen as an extreme form of communism, and the other one as being close to an
extreme version of capitalism, we conclude that, remarkably, humanity is close
to having already tested the limits.

programming problem (QP) whose computational complexity becomes prohibitively
expensive for large scale datasets. Traditional optimization methods cannot be
directly applied in these cases, mainly due to memory restrictions.
  By adopting a slightly different objective function and under mild conditions
on the kernel used within the model, efficient algorithms to train SVMs have
been devised under the name of Core Vector Machines (CVMs). This framework
exploits the equivalence of the resulting learning problem with the task of
building a Minimal Enclosing Ball (MEB) problem in a feature space, where data
is implicitly embedded by a kernel function.
  In this paper, we improve on the CVM approach by proposing two novel methods
to build SVMs based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, recently revisited as a fast
method to approximate the solution of a MEB problem. In contrast to CVMs, our
algorithms do not require to compute the solutions of a sequence of
increasingly complex QPs and are defined by using only analytic optimization
steps. Experiments on a large collection of datasets show that our methods
scale better than CVMs in most cases, sometimes at the price of a slightly
lower accuracy. As CVMs, the proposed methods can be easily extended to machine
learning problems other than binary classification. However, effective
classifiers are also obtained using kernels which do not satisfy the condition
required by CVMs and can thus be used for a wider set of problems.

We employ ten different substructure finders, which span a wide range of
methodologies from simple overdensity in configuration space to full 6-d phase
space analysis of particles.We subject the results to a common post-processing
pipeline to analyse the results in a consistent manner, recovering the
dimensionless spin parameter. We find that spin distribution is an excellent
indicator of how well the removal of background particles (unbinding) has been
carried out. We also find that the spin distribution decreases for substructure
the nearer they are to the host halo's, and that the value of the spin
parameter rises with enclosed mass towards the edge of the substructure.
Finally subhaloes are less rotationally supported than field haloes, with the
peak of the spin distribution having a lower spin parameter.

80% of the short orbital period (Porb=3.32 days) was covered as continuously as
possible for the first time. The source light curve displays variability of
more than two orders of magnitude, starting with a very low emission state
lasting the first 46 ks (1E-13 erg/cm2/s, 1-10 keV), consistent with being due
to the X-ray eclipse by the supergiant companion. The transition to the
uneclipsed X-ray emission is energy dependent. Outside the eclipse, the source
spends most of the time at a level of (6-7)x10^-12 erg/cm2/s punctuated by two
structured faint flares with a duration of about 10 and 15 ks. Remarkably, the
first faint flare occurs at a similar orbital phase of the bright flares
previously observed in the system. This indicates the presence of a
phase-locked large scale structure in the supergiant wind, driving a higher
accretion rate onto the compact object. The scattered component visible during
the X-ray eclipse allowed us to directly probe the wind density at the orbital
separation, resulting in rho=7E-14 g/cm3. Assuming a spherical geometry for the
supergiant wind, the derived wind density translates into a ratio
Mdot_w/v_terminal = 7E-17 solar masses/km which, assuming terminal velocities
in a large range 500-3000 km/s, implies an accretion luminosity two orders of
magnitude higher than that observed. As a consequence, a mechanism is at work
reducing the mass accretion rate. Different possibilities are discussed.

  Wireless Networks",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we analyze power and frequency allocation in wireless networks
through potential games. Potential games are used frequently in the literature
for this purpose due to their desirable properties, such as convergence and
stability. However, potential games usually assume massive message passing to
obtain the necessary neighbor information at each user to achieve these
properties. In this paper we show an example of a game where we are able to
characterize the necessary neighbor information in order to show that the game
has a potential function and the properties of potential games. We consider a
network consisting of local access points where the goal of each AP is to
allocate power and frequency to achieve some SINR requirement. We use the
physical SINR model to validate a successful allocation, and show that given a
suitable payoff function the game emits a generalized ordinal potential
function under the assumption of sufficient neighbor information. Through
simulations we evaluate the performance of the proposed game on a large scale
in relation to the amount of information at each AP.

with a typical near-term low-budget 21 cm intensity mapping experiment. We
derive the 21 cm brightness temperature perturbation consistently in linear
theory including all line-of-sight and relativistic effects. We uncover new
terms that are a small correction on large scales, analogous to those recently
found in the context of galaxy surveys. We then perform a Fisher matrix
analysis of the B_0 parametrization of f(R) gravity, where B_0 is proportional
to the square of Compton wavelength of the scalaron. We find that our 21 cm
survey, in combination with CMB information from Planck, will be able to place
a 95% upper limit of 7 x 10^{-5} on B_0 in flat models with a LCDM expansion
history, improving on current cosmological constraints by several orders of
magnitude. We argue that this constraint is limited by our ability to model the
mildly non-linear regime of structure formation in modified gravity. We also
perform a model-independent principal component analysis on the free functions
introduced into the field equations by modified gravity, mu and Sigma. We find
that 20--30 modes of the free functions will be `well-constrained' by our
combination of observables, the lower and upper limits dependent on the
criteria used to define the `goodness' of the constraint. These constraints are
found to be robust to uncertainties in the time-dependence of the bias. Our
analysis reveals that our observables are sensitive primarily to temporal
variations in Sigma and scale variations in mu. We argue that the inclusion of
21 cm intensity maps will significantly improve constraints on any cosmological
deviations from General Relativity in large-scale structure in a very
cost-effective manner.

the lowest one-particle dispersion for the kagome lattice is extremely flat

Computed Tomography (SPECT) reconstruction is proposed and characterized. The

this model and using the system matrix. Monte Carlo simulations were performed
to provide more realistic data of a phantom with varying smoothness across the
field of view. Reconstructions were performed across a sweep of two primary
design parameters. The results demonstrate that the algorithm recovers the
object in a noiseless simulation case. While the algorithm assumes a specific
blurring model, the results suggest that the algorithm may provide high
reconstruction accuracy even when the object does not match the assumed
blurring model. Generally, increased values of the blurring parameter and TV
weighting parameters reduced noise and streaking artifacts, while decreasing
spatial resolution. As the number of views decreased from 60 to 9 the accuracy
of images reconstructed using the proposed algorithm varied by less than 3%.

  Problems",,,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimizing parameters of Two-Prover-One-Round Game (2P1R) is an important
task in PCPs literature as it would imply a smaller PCP with the same or
stronger soundness. While this is a basic question in PCPs community, the
connection between the parameters of PCPs and hardness of approximations is
sometime obscure to approximation algorithm community. In this paper, we
investigate the connection between the parameters of 2P1R and the hardness of
approximating the class of so-called connectivity problems, which includes as
subclasses the survivable network design and (multi)cut problems. Based on
recent development on 2P1R by Chan (ECCC 2011) and several techniques in PCPs
literature, we improve hardness results of some connectivity problems that are
in the form $k^\sigma$, for some (very) small constant $\sigma>0$, to hardness
results of the form $k^c$ for some explicit constant $c$, where $k$ is a
connectivity parameter. In addition, we show how to convert these hardness into
hardness results of the form $D^{c'}$, where $D$ is the number of demand pairs
(or the number of terminals).
  Thus, we give improved hardness results of k^{1/2-\epsilon} and
k^{1/10-\epsilon} for the root $k$-connectivity problem on directed and
undirected graphs, k^{1/6-\epsilon} for the vertex-connectivity survivable
network design problem on undirected graphs, and k^{1/6-\epsilon} for the
vertex-connectivity $k$-route cut problem on undirected graphs.

strong asymmetry between the forward and backward current ramping and a
discontinuous change of the noise close to its measured maximum occurring at
the switching current. We show that both the large hysteresis and the voltage

of junction's electromagnetic environment. Typically, the voltage-noise
dependence on the junction current parametrized by the external drive contains
a loop which is, however, not observed experimentally because of the
implementation of the junction-current ramp. Skipping a part of the loop is
responsible for the observed hysteresis as well as the noise anomaly.

the sequence of distributions on geodesics optimises the effective sample sizes

the parameters of simulated Lotka-Volterra and Fitzhugh-Nagumo models. In

attains a higher level of statistical robustness in the inferred parameters of

quantum critical point, where N Bogoliubov modes become gapless. As a result,
physics governing arbitrarily-large black holes (e.g., of galactic size) is a
quantum physics of the collective Bogoiliubov modes. This fact introduces a new
intrinsically-quantum corrections in form of 1/N, as opposed to exp(-N). These
corrections are unaccounted by the usual semiclassical expansion in h and
cannot be recast in form of a quantum back-reaction to classical metric.
Instead the metric itself becomes an approximate entity. These 1/N corrections
abolish the presumed properties of black holes, such as non existence of hair,
and are the key to nullifying the so-called information paradox.

conveniently realize the elements of these quotients via intuitive geometric
and combinatorial models such as abaci, alcoves, coroot lattice points, core
partitions, and bounded partitions. Berg, Jones, and Vazirani described a
bijection between n-cores with first part equal to k and (n-1)-cores with first

these other combinatorial models for the quotient of the affine symmetric group
by the finite symmetric group. In this paper we discuss how to generalize the
bijection of Berg-Jones-Vazirani to parabolic quotients of affine Weyl groups
in type C. We develop techniques using the associated affine hyperplane
arrangement to interpret this bijection geometrically as a projection of
alcoves onto the hyperplane containing their coroot lattice points. We are
thereby able to analyze this bijective projection in the language of various

hours to years. We find that, in addition to the power-law continuum and
absorption from ionized gas seen in most AGN, inner disk reflection and
variable absorption from neutral gas within the Broad Emission Line Region are
both necessary components in all three observations. We confirm the clumpy
nature of the cold absorbing gas, though we note that occultations of the inner
disk and corona are much more pronounced in the high-flux state (2008) than in
the low-flux state (2010) of the source. The onset and duration of the ""dips""
in the X-ray light curve in 2010 are both significantly longer than in 2008,
however, indicating that either the distance to the gas from the black hole is
larger, or that the nature of the gas has changed between epochs. We also note
significant variations in the power-law flux over timescales similar to the
cold absorber, both within and between the three observations. The warm
absorber does not vary significantly within observations, but does show
variations in column density of a factor of more than 10 on timescales less
than 2 weeks that seem unrelated to the changes in the continuum, reflection or
cold absorber. By assuming a uniform iron abundance for the reflection and
absorption, we have also established that an iron abundance of roughly 3.5
times the solar value is sufficient to model the broad-band spectrum without
invoking an additional partial-covering absorber. Such a measurement is
consistent with previous published constraints from the 2008 Suzaku observation
alone, and with results from other Seyfert AGN in the literature.
