  Unconstrained Optimization","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1212.5452",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a modified BFGS algorithm is proposed. The modified BFGS
matrix estimates a modified Hessian matrix which is a convex combination of an
identity matrix for the steepest descent algorithm and a Hessian matrix for the
Newton algorithm. The coefficient of the convex combination in the modified
BFGS algorithm is dynamically chosen in every iteration. It is proved that, for
any twice differentiable nonlinear function (convex or non-convex), the
algorithm is globally convergent to a stationary point. If the stationary point
is a local optimizer where the Hessian is strongly positive definite in a
neighborhood of the optimizer, the iterates will eventually enter and stay in
the neighborhood, and the modified BFGS algorithm reduces to the BFGS algorithm
in this neighborhood. Therefore, the modified BFGS algorithm is super-linearly
convergent. Moreover, the computational cost of the modified BFGS in each
iteration is almost the same as the cost of the BFGS. Numerical test on the
CUTE test set is reported. The performance of the modified BFGS algorithm
implemented in our MATLAB function is compared to the BFGS algorithm
implemented in the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox function, a limited memory BFGS
implemented as L-BFGS, a descent conjugate gradient algorithm implemented as
CG-Descent 5.3, and a limited memory, descent and conjugate algorithm
implemented as L-CG-Descent. This result shows that the modified BFGS algorithm
may be very effective.

important task to check whether this new particle is the Standard Model Higgs
boson or something else. In this paper, we study whether the 125 GeV boson
could be the pseudo-Goldstone boson of Little Higgs models. We derive limits on
the parameter space of several Little Higgs models (simple group and product
group models, with and without T-parity), both from the experimental data from
ATLAS and CMS about the different Higgs discovery channel and the electroweak
precision observables. We perform a fit of several Little Higgs models to all
electroweak parameters from measurements of SLC, LEP, Tevatron, and LHC. For
the Higgs searches, we include all available data from the summer conferences
in 2012 as well as the updates from December 2012. We show that there always
exists a region in the parameter space of the models under consideration where
the measured chi^2 is equal or lower than the SM chi^2: a closer look at the
minimum chi^2 will however reveal that the agreement with the collected data is
not significantly better as within the SM. While for the models without
T-parity the Little Higgs scale f is forced to be of the order 2-4 TeV in order
to be compatible with the collected data, in the models with T-parity the scale
f is constrained to be only above O(500) GeV, reducing the amount of
fine-tuning. We also show that these results are still driven by the
electroweak precision measurements due to the bigger LHC data

contribution to the $K_{L}$-$K_{S}$ mass difference, $\Delta M_K$, in lattice
QCD and carry out a first, exploratory calculation of this fundamental
quantity. The calculation is performed on 2+1 flavor, domain wall fermion,
$16^3\times32$ configurations with a 421 MeV pion mass and an inverse lattice
spacing $1/a=1.73$ GeV. We include only current-current operators and drop all
disconnected and double penguin diagrams. The short distance part of the mass
difference in a 2+1 flavor calculation contains a quadratic divergence cut off
by the lattice spacing. Here, this quadratic divergence is eliminated through
the GIM mechanism by introducing a valence charm quark. The inclusion of the
charm quark makes the complete calculation accessible to lattice methods
provided the discretization errors associated with the charm quark can be
controlled. The long distance effects are discussed for each parity channel
separately. While we can see a clear signal in the parity odd channel, the
signal to noise ratio in the parity even channel is exponentially decreasing as
the separation between the two weak operators increases. We obtain a mass
difference $\Delta M_K$ which ranges from $6.58(30)\times 10^{-12}$ MeV to
$11.89(81)\times 10^{-12}$ MeV for kaon masses varying from 563 MeV to 839 MeV.
Extensions of these methods are proposed which promise accurate results for
both $\Delta M_K$ and $\epsilon_K$, including long distance effects.

that pure and maximally mixed states represent the two extremes of contextual

fractional chromatic number of the graph $\chi_f(G)$ and is shown to identify
all state-independent contextual measurement scenarios including those that go

supersymmetric and comes from the supersymmetric neutrino Yukawa sector. Within
the framework of minimal supergravity, we consider both sources of lepton
flavour violation, soft and supersymmetric, and calculate a number of possible

flavour violation, we derive combined theoretical limits on the universal heavy
Majorana mass scale mN and the light-to-heavy neutrino mixings. Supersymmetric

are numerous studies on the correlated timing and spectral variability of these
systems, very little work has been done on high-mass X-ray binaries, the third
major type of X-ray binaries. The main goal of this work is to investigate
whether Be accreting X-ray pulsars display source states and characterise those
states through their spectral and timing properties. We have made a systematic
study of the power spectra, energy spectra and X-ray hardness-intensity
diagrams of nine Be/X-ray pulsars. The evolution of the timing and spectral
parameters were monitored through changes over two orders of magnitude in
luminosity. We find that Be/X-ray pulsars trace two different branches in the
hardness-intensity diagram: the horizontal branch corresponds to a
low-intensity state of the source and it is characterised by fast colour and
spectral changes and high X-ray variability. The diagonal branch is a
high-intensity state that emerges when the X-ray luminosity exceeds a critical
limit. The photon index anticorrelates with X-ray flux in the horizontal branch
but correlates with it in the diagonal branch. The correlation between QPO
frequency and X-ray flux reported in some pulsars is also observed if the peak
frequency of the broad-band noise that accounts for the aperiodic variability
is used. The two branches may reflect two different accretion modes, depending
on whether the luminosity of the source is above or below a critical value.
This critical luminosity is mainly determined by the magnetic field strength,
hence it differs for different sources.

apparent contradiction and show that small polarons can actually coexist with
delocalized electrons in the conduction band of TiO2, the former being
energetically only slightly more favorable. We also find that small polarons
can form complexes with oxygen vacancies and ionized shallow-donor impurities,
explaining the rich spectrum of Ti$^{3+}$ species observed in electron spin
resonance experiments.

behaviour of oxides with hollandite structure, such as $\alpha-\text{MnO}_2$

states are possible, depending on the relative strength of the interactions,
namely AFM ordered and two different disordered, macroscopically degenerate
families of ground states. Remarkably, for sets of AFM couplings having an AFM
ground state in the clean system, there exists a critical value of the disorder
for which the ground state is replaced by a spin-glass phase while maintaining
all couplings AFM. To the best of our knowledge this is the only existing model
that presents this kind of transition with short-range AFM interactions. We
argue that this model could be useful to understand the relation between AFM

mid-J CO observations, we perform a single-phase large velocity gradient (LVG)
analysis to constrain the physical conditions of the molecular gas. Acceptable
models have significant degeneracies between parameters, even when we rule out
all models that produce optically thin emission, but we find that the bulk of
the molecular gas has T_kin=20-60 K, n_{H_2}~10^4-10^5 cm^-3, and
N_CO/Delta-v=10^{17.00+/-0.25} cm^-2 km^-1 s. For our best-fit models to
self-consistently recover a typical CO-to-H_2 abundance and a plausible degree
of virialization, the local velocity gradient in the molecular gas must be
substantially larger than its galaxy-wide average. This conclusion is
consistent with a scenario in which SMM J14011+0252 has a fairly face-on

B_0, is studied theoretically. We establish the mapping of a weakly driven
two-level system with modulation onto a strongly driven system without
modulation. The mapping suggests that different regimes of spin dynamics, known
for a strongly driven system, can be realized under common experimental
conditions of weak driving (driving field B_ 1 << B_ 0) upon proper choice of
the domains of modulation frequency, \omega_m, and amplitude, B_2. Fast
modulation \omega_m >> \Omega_R, where \Omega_R is the Rabi frequency, emulates
the regime of driving frequency much bigger than the resonant frequency. Strong
modulation, B_2 >> B_1, emulates the regime B_1 >> B_0. Resonant modulation,
\omega_m \approx \Omega_R, gives rise to an envelope of the Rabi oscillations.
The shape of this envelope is highly sensitive to the detuning of the driving
frequency from the resonance. Theoretical predictions for different domains of
B_2 and \omega_m were tested experimentally using NMR of protons in water,
where, without modulation, the pattern of Rabi oscillations could be observed
over many periods. We present experimental results which reproduce the three
predicted modulation regimes, and agree with theory quantitatively.

formula---the min-max theorem characterizing the size of maximum matchings. The
notion of barriers plays important roles in numerous contexts of matching
theory, since barriers essentially coincides with dual optimal solutions of the
maximum matching problem. In a special class of graphs called the elementary
graphs, the family of maximal barriers forms a partition of the vertices; this
partition was found by Lov\'asz and is called the canonical partition. The
canonical partition has produced many fundamental results in matching theory,
such as the two ear theorem. However, in non-elementary graphs, the family of
maximal barriers never forms a partition, and there has not been the canonical
partition for general graphs. In this paper, using our previous work, we give a
canonical description of structures of the odd-maximal barriers---a class of
barriers including the maximal barriers---for general graphs; we also reveal
structures of odd components associated with odd-maximal barriers. This result
of us can be regarded as a generalization of Lov\'asz's canonical partition.

plasmas such as those used in inertial confinement fusion. X-ray laser sources
have always been of interest because of the need to have a bright monochromatic
x-ray source to overcome plasma emission and eliminate other lines in the
background that complicate the analysis. With the advent of the xray free
electron laser (X-FEL) at the SLAC Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and other
facilities coming online worldwide, we now have such a source available in the
keV regime. Most Thomson scattering codes used to model experimental data
greatly simplify or neglect the contributions of the bound electrons to the
scattered intensity. In this work we take the existing models of Thomson
scattering that include elastic ion-ion scattering and inelastic
electron-electron scattering and add the contribution of bound electrons in the
partially ionized plasmas. To date, most experiments have studied hydrogen or
beryllium plasmas. We first analyze existing experimental data for beryllium to
validate the code. We then consider several higher Z materials such as Cr and
predict the existence of additional peaks in the scattering spectrum that
requires new computational tools to understand. For a Sn plasma, we show that
bound contributions change the shape of the scattered spectrum in a way that
would change the plasma temperature and density inferred from experiment.

Submitted to PRE",,,,"physics.flu-dyn cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Droplet breakup is a well studied phenomena in Newtonian fluids. One property
of this behavior is that, independent of initial conditions, the minimum radius
exhibits power law scaling with the time left to breakup tau. Because they have
additional structure and shear dependent viscosity, liquid crystals pose an
interesting complication to such studies. Here, we investigate the breakup of a
synthetic nematic liquid crystal known as MBBA. We determine the phase of the
solution by using a cross polarizer setup in situ with the liquid bridge
breakup apparatus. Consistent with previous studies of scaling behavior in
viscous-inertial fluid breakup, when MBBA is in the isotropic phase, the
minimum radius decreases as tau^{1.03 \pm 0.04}. In the nematic phase however,
we observe very different thinning behavior. Our measurements of the thinning
profile are consistent with two interpretations. In the first interpretation,
the breakup is universal and consists of two different regimes. The first
regime is characterized by a symmetric profile with a single minimum whose
radius decreases as tau^{1.51 \pm 0.06}. The second and final regime is
characterized by two minima whose radii decrease as tau^{0.52 \pm 0.11}. These
results are in excellent agreement with previous measurements of breakup in the
nematic phase of liquid crystal 8CB and 5CB. Interestingly, we find that the
entire thinning behavior can also be fit with an exponential decay such that
R_{min} \sim exp((1.2\times 10^2 Hz) tau). This dependence is more reminiscent
of breakup in polymers where entropic stretching slows the thinning process. An
analogous mechanism for slowing in liquid crystals could arise from the role
played by topological constraints governing defect dynamics. Consistent with
this interpretation, crossed polarizer images indicate that significant
alignment of the liquid crystal domains occurs during breakup.

seed fields were most probably extremely weak. To explain the growth of the
magnetic field strength over many orders of magnitude fast amplification
processes need to operate. The most efficient mechanism known today is the
small-scale dynamo, which converts turbulent kinetic energy into magnetic
energy leading to an exponential growth of the magnetic field. The efficiency
of the dynamo depends on the type of turbulence indicated by the slope of the
turbulence spectrum v(l) \propto l^{theta}, where v(l) is the eddy velocity at
a scale l. We explore turbulent spectra ranging from incompressible Kolmogorov
turbulence with theta = 1/3 to highly compressible Burgers turbulence with
theta = 1/2. In this work we analyze the properties of the small-scale dynamo
for low magnetic Prandtl numbers Pm, which denotes the ratio of the magnetic
Reynolds number, Rm, to the hydrodynamical one, Re. We solve the Kazantsev
equation, which describes the evolution of the small-scale magnetic field,
using the WKB approximation. In the limit of low magnetic Prandtl numbers the
growth rate is proportional to Rm^{(1-theta)/(1+theta)}. We furthermore discuss
the critical magnetic Reynolds number Rm_crit, which is required for
small-scale dynamo action. The value of Rm_crit is roughly 100 for Kolmogorov
turbulence and 2700 for Burgers. Furthermore, we discuss that Rm_crit provides
a stronger constraint in the limit of low Pm than it does for large Pm. We
conclude that the small-scale dynamo can operate in the regime of low magnetic
Prandtl numbers, if the magnetic Reynolds number is large enough. Thus, the
magnetic field amplification on small scales can take place in a broad range of
physical environments and amplify week magnetic seed fields on short
timescales.

attention to the supersymmetric standard models with heavy sfermions. Among

particle (LSP) have been widely discussed due to their success in providing a
consistent dark matter candidate. The notable phenomenological feature of the
wino LSP is the degeneracy with its charged SU(2)_L partner (the charged wino)
in mass. The tiny mass splitting makes the charged wino long-lived, which
allows us to detect the wino production at the LHC experiment by searching for
the disappearing charged tracks inside the detectors. Since the reach of the
experiment is sensitive to the mass splitting, it is mandatory to estimate it
very precisely. We therefore perform a full calculation of the mass splitting
at two-loop level, and find that the splitting is reduced by a few MeV compared
to the one-loop calculation. This reduction leads to about a 30 % longer
lifetime of the charged wino, with which the current constraint on the wino
mass by the ATLAS experiment is improved by about 10 %.

temperature, and to the $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{11}$C. The measurement
was to determine unknown resonance parameters for the high excited states of
$^{11}$C. In particular, the $\alpha$ decay width can be useful information to
discuss $\alpha$ cluster structure in $^{11}$C. New measurements of the
$^{7}$Be+$\alpha$ resonant scattering and the $^{7}$Be($\alpha$, $p$)$^{10}$B
reaction in inverse kinematics were performed for center-of-mass energy up to
5.5 MeV, and the resonances at excitation energies of 8.9--12.7 MeV in the
compound $^{11}$C nucleus were studied. Inelastic scattering of
$^{7}$Be+$\alpha$ and the $^{7}$Be($\alpha$, $p_1$)$^{10}$B$^*$ reaction were
also studied with a simultaneous $\gamma$-ray measurement. The measurements
were performed at the low-energy RI beam facility CRIB (CNS Radioactive Ion
Beam separator) of the Center for Nuclear Study (CNS), the University of Tokyo.
We obtained excitation functions of $^{7}$Be($\alpha$, $\alpha_0$)$^{7}$Be
(elastic scattering), $^{7}$Be($\alpha$, $\alpha_1$)$^{7}$Be$^*$ (inelastic
scattering), $^{7}$Be($\alpha$, $p_0$)$^{10}$B, and $^{7}$Be($\alpha$,
$p_1$)$^{10}$B$^*$. Many resonances including a new one were observed and their
parameters were determined by an R-matrix analysis. The resonances we observed
possibly enhance the $^{7}$Be($\alpha$, $\gamma$) reaction rate but in a
smaller magnitude than the lower-lying resonances. A new negative-parity
cluster band, similar to the one previously suggested in the mirror nucleus
$^{11}$B, is proposed.

calculated with $T$=1 and $T$=0 pairing interactions, respectively. To this
end, we consider the $(1f2p)$ shell model space, including single-particle
angular momenta of $l=3$ and $l=1$. It is pointed out that a two-body matrix
element of the spin-triplet $T$=0 pairing is weakened substantially for the
$1f$ orbits, even though the pairing strength is much larger than that for the
spin-singlet $T$=1 pairing interaction. In contrast, the spin-triplet pairing
correlations overcome the spin-singlet pairing correlations for the $2p$
configuration, for which the spin-orbit splitting is smaller than that for the
$1f$ configurations, if the strength for the T=0 pairing is larger than that
for the T=1 pairing by 50% or more. Using the Hartree-Fock wave functions, it
is also pointed out that the mismatch of proton and neutron radial wave
functions is at most a few % level, even if the Fermi energies are largely
different in the proton and neutron mean-field potentials. These results imply
that the configuration with $J^\pi=0^+$, $T$=1 is likely in the ground state of
odd-odd $pf$ shell nuclei even under the influence of the strong spin-triplet
$T$=0 pairing, except at the middle of the $pf$ shell, in which the odd proton
and neutron may occupy the $2p$ orbits. These results are consistent with the
observed spin-parity $J^{\pi}=0^+$ for all odd-odd $pf$ shell nuclei except for
$^{58}_{29}$Cu, which has $J^{\pi}=1^+$.

reduce the dimensionality of matrix data, the method is sensitive to noise and

addressed by improving the fidelity to the study design. Principal axes and the
components for variables are found through the arrangement of the training data
set, and the centers of data are found according to the design. By using both
the axes and the center, components for an observation that belong to various
studies can be separately estimated. Both of the components for variables and

seen between them.
  Results: Analyses in transcriptome studies showed an improvement in the
separation of experimental groups and in robustness to bias and noise. Unknown
samples were appropriately classified on predetermined axes. These axes well
reflected the study design, and this facilitated the interpretation. Together,
the introduced concepts resulted in improved generality and objectivity in the

The first two techniques involve geometric notions attached to submanifolds,

third one is analytic in nature, and it arises from the first occurrence

varies over time. This creates a phenomenon called volatility clustering, where
large price movements on one day are followed by similarly large movements on
successive days, creating temporal clusters. The GARCH model, which treats
volatility as a drift process, is commonly used to capture this behavior.
However research suggests that volatility is often better described by a
structural break model, where the volatility undergoes abrupt jumps in addition
to drift. Most efforts to integrate these jumps into the GARCH methodology have
resulted in models which are either very computationally demanding, or which
make problematic assumptions about the distribution of the instruments, often
assuming that they are Gaussian. We present a new approach which uses ideas
from nonparametric statistics to identify structural break points without
making such distributional assumptions, and then models drift separately within
each identified regime. Using our method, we investigate the volatility of
several major stock indexes, and find that our approach can potentially give an
improved fit compared to more commonly used techniques.

jitter amplification, consequently degrading the luminosity. Therefore, a
better understanding of collimator wakefield effects is essential to optimise
the collimation systems of future linear colliders in order to minimise
wakefield effects. In the past, measurements of single-bunch collimator
wakefields have been carried out at SLAC with the aim of benchmarking theory,
numerical calculations and experiments. Those studies revealed some
discrepancies between the measurements and the theoretical models. New
experimental tests using available beam test facilities, such as the End

collimator wakefields. ESTB will provide the perfect test bed to investigate
collimator wakefields for different bunch length conditions, relevant for both
ILC (300 micrometers nominal bunch length) and CLIC (44 micrometers nominal

triangles by any of its diagonals. When move a node to smooth a quadrilateral,
it is optimal to make a pair of triangles divided by a diagonal be equilateral
right triangles separately. The finally smoothed position is obtained by
weighting all individual optimal positions. Three variants are produced
according to the determination of weights. Tests by the TBase are given and
compared with Laplacian smoothing: The Vari.1 of TBase is effectively identical
to Laplacian smoothing for planar quad meshes, while Vari.2 is the best. For
the quad mesh on underlying parametric surface and interpolation surface,
Vari.2 and Vari.1 are best, respectively.

polygons and polygons with holes are presented. In the basic version, the ear
with smallest interior angle is always selected to be cut in order to create
fewer sliver triangles. To reduce sliver triangles in further, a bound of angle
is set to determine whether a newly formed triangle has sharp angles, and edge
swapping is accepted when the triangle is sharp. To apply the two algorithms on
polygons with holes, ""Bridge"" edges are created to transform a polygon with
holes to a degenerate polygon which can be triangulated by the two algorithms.
Applications show that the basic algorithm can avoid creating sliver triangles
and obtain better triangulations than the traditional ear clipping algorithm,
and the improved algorithm can in further reduce sliver triangles effectively.
Both of the algorithms run in O(n2) time and O(n) space.

is to determine the performance of the available control techniques at high

strategies based on spanwise forcing (oscillating wall and streamwise-traveling
waves applied to a plane channel flow), and explore via Direct Numerical
Simulations (DNS) up to $Re_\tau=2100$ the rate at which their performance
deteriorates as $Re$ is increased. To be able to carry out a comprehensive
parameter study, we limit the computational cost of the simulations by
adjusting the size of the computational domain in the homogeneous directions,
compromising between faster computations and the increased need of
time-averaging the fluctuating space-mean wall shear-stress.
  Our results, corroborated by a few full-scale DNS, suggest a scenario where
drag reduction degrades with $Re$ at a rate that varies according to the
parameters of the wall forcing. In agreement with already available
information, keeping them at their low-$Re$ optimal value produces a relatively
quick decrease of drag reduction. However, at higher $Re$ the optimal
parameters shift towards other regions of the parameter space, and these
regions turn out to be much less sensitive to $Re$. Once this shift is
accounted for, drag reduction decreases with $Re$ at a markedly slower rate. If
the slightly favorable trend of the energy required to create the forcing is
considered, a chance emerges for positive net energy savings also at large
values of the Reynolds number.

abundances in the narrow range log \epsilon(Li) = 1.1-1.8; (iii) all other
stars provide just upper limits to the Li abundance.
  The derived Li abundances are compared with theoretical predictions of 2-15
Msun stars. Our results are generally in good agreement with theory. In
particular, the absence of detectable lithium for the majority of programme
stars is explainable. The comparison suggests that the stars may be separated
by mass M into two groups, namely M < 6 Msun and M > 6 Msun. All Li-rich giants
and supergiants with log \epsilon(Li) > 2.0 have masses M < 6 Msun; 11 of 13
stars with log \epsilon(Li) = 1.1-1.8, specifically the stars with M < 6 Msun,
show good agreement with the post-first dredge-up surface abundance log
\epsilon(Li) = 1.4 predicted for the non-rotating 2-6 Msun stellar models. An
absence of Li-rich stars in the range M > 6 Msun agrees with the theoretical
prediction that F and G supergiants and giants with M > 6 Msun cannot show
detectable lithium.
  We note that present theory appears unable to account for the derived Li
abundances for some stars, namely for (i) a few relatively low-mass Li-rich
giants (M < 6 Msun), whose high Li abundances accompanied by rather high
rotational velocities or substantial nitrogen excess contradict theoretical
predictions; (ii) the relatively high-mass supergiants HR 461 and HR 8313 (M >
6 Msun) with the detected abundances log \epsilon = 1.3-1.5. It is possible
that the lithium in such stars was synthesized recently.

prone to various kinds of attacks like dictionary attacks. A dictionary attack
is a method of breaking the password by systematically entering every word in a
dictionary as a password. This attack leads to an overload on the server
leading to denial of service attack. This paper presents a protocol to reduce
the rate of dictionary attack by using a prover and a verifier system. This
system makes it difficult for the attacker to prove it as a valid user by
becoming computationally intensive. The rate of attempts is also reduced and
thus restricting the Denial of Service attack.

  2011",,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pipelines tubes are part of vital mechanical systems largely used in
petrochemical industries. They serve to transport natural gases or liquids.
They are cylindrical tubes and are submitted to the risks of corrosion due to
high PH concentrations of the transported liquids in addition to fatigue cracks
due to the alternation of pressure-depression of gas along the time, initiating
therefore in the tubes body micro-cracks that can propagate abruptly to lead to
failure. The development of the prognostic process for such systems increases
largely their performance and their availability, as well decreases the global
cost of their missions. Therefore, this paper deals with a new prognostic
approach to improve the performance of these pipelines. Only the first mode of
crack, that is, the opening mode, is considered.

  Baouendi type",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a new notion of Almgren's frequency which is adapted to
solutions of a sub-Laplacian (harmonic functions) on a Carnot group of
arbitrary step $\bG$. With this notion we investigate some new functionals
associated with the frequency, and obtain monotonicity formulas for the
relevant harmonic functions, or for the solutions of a closely connected class
of degenerate second order operators of Baouendi type. The results proved in
this paper provide some new insight into the deep link existing between the
growth properties of the frequency, and the local and global structure of the
relevant harmonic functions in these non-elliptic, or subelliptic, settings

of the electromagnetic field in the ultrastrong-coupling regime based upon
resonant Raman transitions in an atom interacting with a high finesse optical
cavity mode. We show by numerical simulation the possibility of realizing the
scheme with a single rubidium atom, in which two hyperfine ground states make
up the effective two-level system, and for cavity QED parameters that should be
achievable with, for example, microtoroidal whispering-gallery-mode resonators.
Our system also enables simulation of a generalized model in which a nonlinear
coupling between the atomic inversion and the cavity photon number occurs on an
equal footing with the (ultrastrong) dipole coupling and can give rise to
critical-type behavior even at the single-atom level. Our model takes account
of dissipation, and we pay particular attention to observables that would be
readily observable in the output from the system.

transformations on odd dimensional manifolds. We provide definition of
generalized Sasakain structures from the view point of the generalized almost

manifold which does not arise as a pair of ordinary Sasakian structures.
However we show that a generalized Sasakian structure on compact 3-dimensional
manifold is equivalent to a pair of Sasakian structures with the same metric.
Finally we extend a definition of a generalized almost contact structure.

  interpretation of large unstructured datasets","9 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.GR stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) are popular unsupervised artificial neural network
used to reduce dimensions and visualize data. Visual interpretation from
Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) has been limited due to grid approach of data
representation, which makes inter-scenario analysis impossible. The paper
proposes a new way to structure SOM. This model reconstructs SOM to show
strength between variables as the threads of a cobweb and illuminate
inter-scenario analysis. While Radar Graphs are very crude representation of
spider web, this model uses more lively and realistic cobweb representation to
take into account the difference in strength and length of threads. This model
allows for visualization of highly unstructured dataset with large number of
dimensions, common in Bigdata sources.
