its dispersion relations. This allows understanding known properties, as well
as designing new ones when spatially extended initial conditions are
considered. This is done by deriving wave equations in the continuum, which are
generically of the Schr\""odinger type, and allow devising interesting
behaviors, such as ballistic propagation without deformation, or the generation
of almost flat probability distributions, what is corroborated numerically.
There are however special points where the energy surfaces display
intersections and, near them, the dynamics is entirely different. Applications
to the two- and three-dimensional Grover walks are presented.

nearest-neighbor random Gaussian coupling is studied by extensive Monte Carlo
simulations. To investigate the ordering of the spin and the chirality, we
compute several independent physical quantities including the glass order
parameter, the Binder parameter, the correlation-length ratio, the overlap
distribution and the non-self-averageness parameter, {\it etc}, for both the
spin-glass (SG) and the chiral-glass (CG) degrees of freedom. Evidence of the
spin-chirality decoupling, {\it i.e.}, the CG and the SG order occurring at two
separated temperatures, $0<T_{SG}<T_{CG}$, is obtained from the glass order
parameter, which is fully corroborated by the Binder parameter. By contrast,
the CG correlation-length ratio yields a rather pathological and inconsistent
result in the range of sizes we studied, which may originate from the
finite-size effect associated with a significant short-length drop-off of the
spatial CG correlations. Finite-size-scaling analysis yields the CG exponents
$\nu_{CG}=1.36^{+0.15}_{-0.37}$ and $\eta_{CG}=0.26^{+0.29}_{-0.26}$, and the
SG exponents $\nu_{SG}=1.22^{+0.26}_{-0.06}$ and
$\eta_{SG}=-0.54^{+0.24}_{-0.52}$. The obtained exponents are close to those of
the Heisenberg SG, but are largely different from those of the Ising SG. The
chiral overlap distribution and the chiral Binder parameter exhibit the feature
of a continuous one-step replica-symmetry breaking (1RSB), consistently with
the previous reports. Such a 1RSB feature is again in common with that of the
Heisenberg SG, but is different from the Ising one, which may be the cause of
the difference in the CG critical properties from the Ising SG ones despite of
a common $Z_2$ symmetry.

constructions on ornaments are typically explained through an operational

  In this paper, we give a categorical model of ornaments. As a necessary first
step, we abstract the universe of datatypes using the theory of polynomial
functors. We are then able to characterize ornaments as cartesian morphisms
between polynomial functors. We thus gain access to powerful mathematical tools
that shall help us understand and develop ornaments.
  We shall also illustrate the adequacy of our model. Firstly, we rephrase the
standard ornamental constructions into our framework. Thanks to its

resource, i.e, the tragedy of the commons, can be reformulated as a game of
prisoner's dilemma: while preserving the common resource is in the best
interest of the group, over-consumption is in the interest of each particular
individual at any given point in time. One way to try and prevent the tragedy
of the commons is through infliction of punishment for over-consumption and/or
encouraging under-consumption, thus selecting against over-consumers. Here, the
effectiveness of various punishment functions in an evolving consumer-resource
system is evaluated within a framework of a parametrically heterogeneous system
of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Conditions leading to the
possibility of sustainable coexistence with the common resource for a subset of
cases are identified analytically using adaptive dynamics; the effects of
punishment on heterogeneous populations with different initial composition are
evaluated using the Reduction theorem for replicator equations. Obtained
results suggest that one cannot prevent the tragedy of the commons through
rewarding of under-consumers alone - there must also be an implementation of
some degree of punishment that increases in a non-linear fashion with respect
to over-consumption and which may vary depending on the initial distribution of
clones in the population.

quantum Hopf algebra (U_z(g),\Delta_z) starting from the Lie bialgebra
(g,\delta) that gives the first-order deformation of the coproduct map \Delta_z
is presented. The procedure is based on the fact that any quantum algebra can
be viewed as the quantization of the unique Poisson-Lie structure
(G^\ast,\Lambda_g) on the dual group G^\ast, which is obtained by
exponentiating the Lie algebra g^\ast defined by the dual map \delta^\ast. From
this perspective, the coproduct for U_z(g) is just the pullback of the group
law for G^\ast, and the Poisson analogues of the quantum commutation rules for
U_z(g) are given by the unique Poisson-Lie structure \Lambda_g on G^\ast whose
linearization is the Poisson analogue of the initial Lie algebra g. This
approach is shown to be very useful in order to construct quantum deformations
explicitly since, once a Lie bialgebra (g,\delta) is given, the full dual
Poisson-Lie group (G^\ast,\Lambda) can be obtained either by applying standard
Poisson-Lie group techniques or by implementing the algorithm here presented
with the aid of symbolic manipulation programs. As a consequence, the
quantization of (G^\ast,\Lambda) will give rise to the full U_z(g) quantum
algebra, provided that ordering problems are appropriately fixed. The
applicability of this approach is explicitly demonstrated by constructing
several instances of quantum deformations of physically relevant Lie algebras
as sl(2,R), the (2+1) Anti de Sitter algebra so(2,2) and the Poincar\'e algebra

three-dimensional turbulence forms after two reconnection steps and the
formation of at least one vortex ring. The long domain is needed in order to
accommodate the multiple reconnections, which enhance vortex stretching rates
and the generation of small-scale vortex structures within the vortex rings. In
addition to making the initial vortices very long, new features introduced with
this initial condition are an initial profile less likely to shed vortex sheets
and an improved method for mapping the direction of the vorticity onto the
three-dimensional mesh. To get to the turbulent state, the vortices progress
through the following steps: First, until the first reconnection, the vortex
dynamics is largely consistent with existing work on strong, possibly singular,
growth of the vorticity in the Euler equations. Second, vortex reconnection at
the junction of the primary symmetry planes meet. About half of the circulation
from each vortex reconnects into two ""bridges"", leaving behind two ""threads"",
with the bridges and threads arranged into 4 orthogonal pairs. In the third
step, stretching is induced by new anti-parallel attractions due to the
twisting that forms along the reconnected vortices. This extra stretching then
pulls on the threads as they wind around the bridges, resulting in spirals over
the entire vortices. In the fourth step, multiple vortex rings form through
multiple reconnections, with each ring consisting of spiral vortices. A
$k^{-5/3}$ energy spectra begins to form after the first ring separates and
eventually covers one decade. It is argued that the spirals are the source of
the $k^{-5/3}$ spectra that develops. Furthermore, a new hierarchy of rescaled
vorticity moments is found where the lower-order moments bound the higher-order
moments for all orders and all times.

field systems is via a continuous tensor contraction. This approach is first
illustrated for the class of quantum field states known as continuous
matrix-product states (cMPS). As a simple example of the path-integral
representation we show that the state of a dynamically evolving quantum field
admits a natural representation as a cMPS. A completeness argument is also
provided that shows that all states in Fock space admit a cMPS representation
when the number of variational parameters tends to infinity. Beyond this, we
obtain a well-behaved field limit of projected entangled pair states (PEPS) in
two dimensions that provide an abstract class of quantum field states with
natural symmetries. We demonstrate how symmetries of the physical field state
are encoded within the dynamics of an auxiliary field system of one dimension
less. In particular, the imposition of Euclidean symmetries on the physical
system requires that the auxiliary system involved in the class' definition
must be Lorentz-invariant. The physical field states automatically inherit
entropy area laws from the PEPS class, and are fully described by the
dissipative dynamics of a lower dimensional virtual field system. Our results
lie at the intersection many-body physics, quantum field theory and quantum
information theory, and facilitate future exchanges of ideas and insights

evolving and yet there is no available tools supporting practical verifications

This work was motivated to develop approximate techniques checking automata

greater than between the parent star and the orbiting planet (ratio of the

information-theoretic differences with two-receiver one. In this paper, we
derive achievable rate regions for two classes of 3-receiver BC with side
information (SI), i.e. Multilevel BC (MBC) and 3-receiver less noisy BC, using
a combination of superposition coding, Gelfand-Pinsker binning scheme and
Nair-El Gamal indirect decoding. Our rate region for MBC subsumes Steinberg
rate region for 2-receiver degraded BC with SI as its special case. We will
also show that the obtained achievable rate regions in the first two cases are
tight for several classes of non-deterministic, semi-deterministic, and
deterministic 3-receiver BC when SI is available both at the transmitter and at
the receivers. We also prove that as far as a receiver is deterministic in the
three-receiver less noisy BC, the presence of side information at that receiver
does not affect the capacity region. We have also provided the writing on dirty

section, we provide simple bounds on the capacity region of the Additive

Spitzer young stellar objects nor mid-IR point sources within. Fitting the SED

identify an additional velocity component within the bubble's 8mu emission rim

induced by the expanding HII region. While the elevated temperature allows for
the build-up of larger fragments, and the shock induced velocity component may

f, makes a constant number of queries to f, always accepts if f satisfies P,
and rejects with positive probability if the distance between f and P is

closed under taking restrictions to subspaces and has bounded complexity is
testable.
  We also prove that any property that can be described as the property of
decomposing into a known structure of low-degree polynomials is locally
characterized and is, hence, testable. For example, whether a function is a
product of two degree-d polynomials, whether a function splits into a product
of d linear polynomials, and whether a function has low rank are all examples

  Our results depend on a new Gowers inverse theorem by Tao and Ziegler for low
characteristic fields that decomposes any polynomial with large Gowers norm
into a function of low-degree non-classical polynomials. We establish a new
equidistribution result for high rank non-classical polynomials that drives the
proofs of both the testability results and the local characterization of
degree-structural properties.

candidates in the redshift range z~7-12 using deep images from the UDF12

work. Firstly, we utilize the increased S/N ratio offered by the UDF12 imaging
to provide improved size measurements for known galaxies at z=6.5-8 in the
HUDF. Specifically, we stack the new deep F140W image with the existing F125W
data in order to provide improved measurements of the half-light radii of
z-dropouts. Similarly we stack this image with the new deep UDF12 F160W image
to obtain new size measurements for a sample of Y-dropouts. Secondly, because
the UDF12 data have allowed the construction of the first robust galaxy sample
in the HUDF at z>8, we have been able to extend the measurement of average
galaxy size out to significantly higher redshifts. Restricting our size
measurements to sources which are now detected at >15sigma, we confirm earlier
indications that the average half-light radii of z~7-12 galaxies are extremely
small, 0.3-0.4 kpc, comparable to the sizes of giant molecular associations in
local star-forming galaxies. We also confirm that there is a clear trend of
decreasing half-light radius with increasing redshift, and provide the first
evidence that this trend continues beyond z~8. Modeling the evolution of the
average half-light radius as a power-law (1+z)^s, we obtain a best-fit index of
s=-1.28+/-0.13 over the redshift range z~4-12, mid-way between the physically
expected evolution for baryons embedded in dark halos of constant mass (s=-1)
and constant velocity (s=-1.5). A clear size-luminosity relation, such as that
found at lower redshift, is also evident in both our z- and Y-dropout sample.
This relation can be interpreted in terms of a constant surface density of star

(CML), a logic that characterizes stochastic bisimulation of Markov processes
with an arbitrary measurable state space and continuous-time transitions. For a
parameter epsilon>0 interpreted as observational error, we introduce an
epsilon-parameterized metatheory for CML: we define the concepts of
epsilon-satisfiability and epsilon-provability related by a sound and complete
axiomatization and prove a series of ""parameterized"" metatheorems including
decidability, weak completeness and finite model property. We also prove
results regarding the relations between metalogical concepts defined for
different parameters. Using this framework, we can characterize both the
stochastic bisimulation relation and various observational preorders based on
behavioural pseudometrics. The main contribution of this paper is proving that
all these analyses can actually be done using a unified complete Boolean

We present an improved semantics for this language, using an abstraction that

extract UCs for propositional LTL. The resulting UCs are more fine-grained than
the UCs obtained from existing tools because UC extraction also simplifies
top-level conjuncts instead of treating them as atomic entities. For example,
given an unsatisfiable LTL formula of the form $\phi \equiv ({\bf G} \psi)
\wedge {\bf F} \psi'$ existing tools return $\phi$ as a UC irrespective of the
complexity of $\psi$ and $\psi'$, whereas the approach presented in this
article continues to remove parts not required for unsatisfiability inside
$\psi$ and $\psi'$. Our approach also identifies groups of occurrences of a
proposition that do not interact in a proof of unsatisfiability. We implement
our approach in TRP++. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our
approach (i) extracts UCs that are often significantly smaller than the input
formula with an acceptable overhead and (ii) produces more fine-grained UCs
than competing tools while remaining at least competitive in terms of run time
and memory usage. The source code of our tool is publicly available.

protostar forming from a massive (Mc=60 Msun) protostellar core, extending the
model developed by Zhang & Tan (2011). The two principal improvements are (1)
developing a model for the density and velocity structure of a disk wind that
fills the bipolar outflow cavities; and (2) solving for the radially varying
accretion rate in the disk due to a supply of mass and angular momentum from
the infall envelope and their loss to the disk wind. One consequence of the
launching of the disk wind is a reduction in the amount of accretion power that
is radiated by the disk. For the transition from dusty to dust-free conditions
where gas opacities dominate, we now implement a gradual change as a more
realistic approximation of dust destruction. We study how the above effects,
especially the outflow, influence the SEDs and the images of the protostar.
Dust in the outflow cavity significantly affects the SEDs at most viewing
angles. It further attenuates the short-wavelength flux from the protostar,
controlling how the accretion disk may be viewed, and contributes a significant
part of the near- and mid-IR fluxes. These fluxes warm the disk, boosting the
mid- and far-IR emission. We find that for near face-on views, the SED from the
near-IR to about 60 micron is very flat, which may be used to identify such
systems. We show that the near-facing outflow cavity and its walls are still
the most significant features in images up to 70 micron, dominating the mid-IR
emission and determining its morphology. The thermal emission from the dusty
outflow itself dominates the flux at ~20 micron. The detailed distribution of
the dust in the outflow affects the morphology, for example, even though the
outflow cavity is wide, at 10 to 20 micron, the dust in the disk wind can make
the outflow appear narrower than in the near-IR bands.

Space-Time Block Codes (STBCs), one corresponding to each of the N possible
feedback values, to encode and transmit information. The feedback function used
at the receiver and the N component STBCs used at the transmitter together
constitute a Finite Feedback Scheme (FFS). Although a number of FFSs are
available in the literature that provably achieve full-diversity, there is no
known universal criterion to determine whether a given arbitrary FFS achieves
full-diversity or not. Further, all known full-diversity FFSs for T<N_t where
N_t is the number of transmit antennas, have rate at the most 1. In this paper
a universal necessary condition for any FFS to achieve full-diversity is given,
using which the notion of Feedback-Transmission duration optimal (FT-Optimal)
FFSs - schemes that use minimum amount of feedback N given the transmission
duration T, and minimum transmission duration given the amount of feedback to
achieve full-diversity - is introduced. When there is no feedback (N=1) an
FT-optimal scheme consists of a single STBC with T=N_t, and the universal
necessary condition reduces to the well known necessary and sufficient
condition for an STBC to achieve full-diversity: every non-zero codeword
difference matrix of the STBC must be of rank N_t. Also, a sufficient condition
for full-diversity is given for the FFSs in which the component STBC with the
largest minimum Euclidean distance is chosen. Using this sufficient condition
full-rate (rate N_t) full-diversity FT-Optimal schemes are constructed for all
(N_t,T,N) with NT=N_t. These are the first full-rate full-diversity FFSs
reported in the literature for T<N_t. Simulation results show that the new
schemes have the best error performance among all known FFSs.

are described by a universal model, the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density
profiles. As a consequence of baryonic cooling effects, the halos will become
more concentrated, and similar to an isothermal sphere over large range in
radii ($\sim 300$ $h^{-1}$kpc). The singular isothermal sphere model however
has to be truncated artificially at large radii since it extends to infinity.
We model a massive galaxy halo as a combination of an isothermal sphere and an
NFW density profile. We give an approximation for the mass concentration at
different baryon fractions and present exact expressions for the weak lensing
shear and flexion for such a halo. We compare the lensing properties with a
Singular Isothermal Sphere and NFW profiles. We find that the combined profile
can generate higher order lensing signals at small radii and is more efficient
in generating strong lensing events. In order to distinguish such a halo
profile from the SIS or NFW profiles, one needs to combine strong and weak
lensing constraints on small and large radii.

voltage pulses applied on a contact is studied in the energy and time-domain
using shot noise computation in order to make comparison with experiments. We
particularly consider the case of periodic Lorentzian voltage pulses. When
carrying integer charge, they are known to provide electronic states with a
minimal number of excitations, while other type of pulses are all accompanied
by an extra neutral cloud of electron and hole excitations. This paper focuses
on the low frequency shot noise which arises when the pulse excitations are
partitioned by a single scatterer in the framework of the Photo Assisted Shot
Noise (PASN) theory. As a unique tool to count the number of excitations
carried per pulse, shot noise reveals that pulses of arbitrary shape and
arbitrary charge show a marked minimum when the charge is integer. Shot noise
spectroscopy is also considered to perform energy-domain characterization of
the charge pulses. In particular it reveals the striking asymmetrical spectrum
of Lorentzian pulses. Finally, time-domain information is obtained from Hong Ou
Mandel like noise correlations when two trains of pulses generated on opposite
contacts collide on the scatterer. As a function of the time delay between
pulse trains, the noise is shown to measure the electron wavepacket
autocorrelation function for integer Lorentzian thanks to electron
antibunching. In order to make contact with recent experiments all the
calculations are made at zero and finite temperature.

specifically, we consider transformations that do not mix eigenmodes of the
Laplace-Beltrami operator, which are supposed to be dynamically decoupled. In
addition, we assume that the canonical transformations admit an asymptotic
expansion for large eigenvalues (in norm) of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in
the form of a series of half integer powers. Canonical transformations of this
kind are found in the study of scalar perturbations in inflationary
cosmologies, relating for instance the physical degrees of freedom of these

Bardeen quantities. We characterize all possible transformations of this type

criterion of requiring (i) invariance of the vacuum under the spatial

equivalence class of Fock quantizations, all of them related by unitary
transformations. This conclusion provides even further robustness to the
validity of the proposed criterion, completing the results that have already

analysis and signal processing technique with diverse applications. This paper
is targeted at discussing theoretical large sample properties of ICA unmixing
matrix functionals. We provide a formal definition of unmixing matrix
functional and consider two popular estimators in detail: the family based on
two scatter matrices with the independence property (e.g., FOBI estimator) and
the family of deflation-based fastICA estimators. The limiting behavior of the
corresponding estimates is discussed and the asymptotic normality of the
deflation-based fastICA estimate is proven under general assumptions.
Furthermore, properties of several performance indices commonly used for
comparison of different unmixing matrix estimates are discussed and a new
performance index is proposed. The proposed index fullfills three desirable
features which promote its use in practice and distinguish it from others.
Namely, the index possesses an easy interpretation, is fast to compute and its
asymptotic properties can be inferred from asymptotics of the unmixing matrix
estimate. We illustrate the derived asymptotical results and the use of the
proposed index with a small simulation study.

Understanding the energy transfer to these heated atmospheric layers requires
direct access to the relevant empirical data. Study of these structures has, by
and large, been limited to the Sun thus far. The region of the temperature
reversal can be directly observed only in the far infrared and submm. We aim at
the determination of the characteristics of the atmosphere in the region of the
temperature minimum of the solar sister star alpha Cen A. For the nearby binary
system alpha Centauri, stellar parameters are known with high accuracy from
measurements. For the basic model parameters Teff, log g and [Fe/H], we
interpolate in the grid of GAIA/PHOENIX stellar model atmospheres and compute
the corresponding model for the G2 V star alpha Cen A. Comparison with
photometric measurements shows excellent agreement between observed
photospheric data in the optical and infrared. For longer wavelengths, the
modelled spectral energy distribution is compared to MIPS, PACS, SPIRE and
LABOCA photometry. A specifically tailored Uppsala model based on the MARCS
code and extending further in wavelength is used to gauge the emission
characteristics of alpha Cen A in the FIR. Similar to the Sun, the FIR emission
of alpha Cen A originates in the minimum temperature region above the stellar
photosphere in the visible. However, in comparison with the solar case, the FIR
photosphere of alpha Cen A appears marginally cooler, Tmin=T160mu=3920+/-375 K.
Beyond the minimum near 160mu, the brightness temperatures increase and this
radiation likely originates in warmer regions of the chromosphere of alpha Cen
A. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time a temperature minimum
has been directly measured on a main-sequence star other than the Sun.

to the small-x asymptotics of the structure functions with Q^2 -dependent

(Q^2) is an approximation valid in the region of large x (where 2pq can be
approximated by Q^2) only, providing the factorization scale is also large.
Outside this region, the DGLAP parametrization fails, so alpha_s should be
replaced by an effective coupling which is independent of Q^2 at small x. As a
consequence, intercepts of the structure functions are independent of Q^2.
Nevertheless, the small-x asymptotics of the structure functions explicitly
depend on Q^2, even when the coupling does not depend on it. We also consider
the structure functions at small Q^2 and give a comment on power-Q^2

may lead to lower central C-burning temperatures and to 13C(alpha,n)16O
emerging as a more dominant neutron source than 22Ne(alpha,n)25Mg, increasing
significantly the s-process production. This is due to the rapid decrease of
the 13N(gamma,p)12C with decreasing temperature, causing the 13C production via
13N(beta+)13C. Presented here is the impact of the 12C+12C reaction
uncertainties on the s-process and on explosive p-process nucleosynthesis in
massive stars, including also fast rotating massive stars at low metallicity.
Using various 12C+12C rates, in particular an upper and lower rate limit of ~

13C(alpha,n)16O activation is considered, taking into account the impact of the
uncertainty of all three C-burning reaction branches. Consequently, we show
that the p-process abundances have an average production factor increased up to
about a factor of 8 compared to the standard case, efficiently producing the
elusive Mo and Ru proton-rich isotopes. We also show that an s-process being
driven by 13C(alpha,n)16O is a secondary process, even though the abundance of

Fermi-liquid gradually turns into a bad non-Fermi liquid metal, a process which
culminates in the pseudogap regime, in which the antinodal region in momentum
space acquires a gap before reaching a fully gapped Mott state.
  Here we show that experiments for electron- and hole-doped BaFe2As2 support
an analogous scenario. The doping evolution is dominated by the influence of a
Mott insulator that would be realized for half-filled conduction bands, while
the stoichiometric compound does not play a special role. Weakly and strongly
correlated conduction electrons coexist in much of the phase diagram, a
differentiation which increases with hole doping. We identify the reason for
this selective Mottness in a strong Hund's coupling, which decouples the
different orbitals. Each orbital then behaves as a single band Hubbard model,
where the correlation degree only depends on how doped is each orbital from
half-filling. Our scenario reconciles contrasting evidences on the electronic
correlation strength and establishes a deep connection with the cuprates.

the Buchstaber invariant theory from the viewpoint of the set of minimal

phase transition in a dispersion model of nematic liquid crystals, where the
molecules are either perfectly uniaxial or biaxial (board-like), has been
studied by Monte Carlo simulation. Using multiple histogram reweighting
technique and finite size scaling analysis the order of the phase transition,
the transition temperature at the thermodynamic limit and the stability limit
of the isotropic phase below the transition temperature for different magnetic
field strengths have been determined. The magnetic field dependence of the
shift in $N-I$ transition temperature is observed to be more rapid than that
predicted by the standard Landau-de Gennes and Maier-Saupe mean field theories.
We have shown that for a given field strength the shift in the transition
temperature is higher for the biaxial molecules in comparison with the uniaxial
case. The study shows that the $N-I$ transition for the biaxial molecules is
weaker than the well known weak first order $N-I$ transition for the uniaxial
molecules and the presence of the external magnetic field (up to a certain
critical value) makes the transition much more weaker for both the systems. The
estimate of the critical magnetic field ($\sim 110 T$) for the common nematics
is found to be smaller than the earlier estimates.

liquids are immiscible, and the contact angles between them are given by the
Neumann construction. The evaporation of the drop gives rise to flows in both
liquids, which are coupled by the continuity of velocity and shear-stress
conditions. We derive self-similar solutions to the velocity fields in both
liquids close to the three-phase contact line, where the drop geometry can be
approximated by a wedge. We focus on the case where Marangoni stresses are
negligible, for which the flow field consists of three contributions: flow
driven by the evaporative flux from the drop surface, flow induced by the
receding motion of the contact line, and an eigenmode flow that satisfies the
homogeneous boundary conditions. The eigenmode flow is asymptotically
subdominant for all contact angles. The moving contact-line flow dominates when
the angle between the liquid drop and the horizontal surface of the liquid
subphase is smaller than $90^\circ$, while the evaporative-flux driven flow
dominates for larger angles. A parametric study is performed to show how the
velocity fields in the two liquids depend on the contact angles between the

depinning transitions are very different from many viewpoints. We evaluate
three critical exponents of the elastic depinning transition. $\beta = 0.29 \pm
0.03$ is found for the velocity exponent at zero temperature, and from the
velocity-temperature curves we extract the critical exponent $\delta^{-1} =

finite-size scaling analysis suggests the existence of a unique diverging
length at the depinning threshold with an exponent $\nu= 1.04 \pm 0.04$, which
controls the critical force distribution, the finite-size crossover force

parameter T_eff of the low p_T direct-photon spectrum observed at LHC and RHIC,
recent hydrodynamical descriptions of the direct-photon production include a
substantial portion of thermal photons from the hot plasma phase. As a

small compared to hadrons. A large v_{2}^{\gamma,dir} might lend support for a
significant direct-photon emission from late stages of the system evolution

systems to cope with uncertainty, complexity and sub-optimality. An answer is
to enhance the information sharing between the stakeholders. This paper
introduces a framework that bridges the gap between air traffic management and
air traffic control on the one hand, and bridges the gap between the ground,
the approach and the en-route centers on the other hand. An original system is
presented, that has three essential components: the trajectory models, the
optimization process, and the monitoring process. The uncertainty of the
trajectory is modeled with a Bayesian Network, where the nodes are associated
to two types of random variables: the time of overflight on metering points of
the airspace, and the traveling time of the routes linking these points. The
resulting Bayesian Network covers the complete airspace, and Monte- Carlo
simulations are done to estimate the probabilities of sector congestion and
delays. On top of this trajectory model, an optimization process minimizes
these probabilities by tuning the parameters of the Bayesian trajectory model
related to overflight times on metering points. The last component is the
monitoring process, that continuously updates the situation of the airspace,
modifying the trajectories uncertainties according to actual positions of
aircraft. After each update, a new optimal set of overflight times is computed,
and can be communicated to the controllers as clearances for the aircraft
pilots. The paper presents a formal specification of this global optimization
problem, whose underlying rationale was derived with the help of air traffic
controllers at Thales Air Systems.

measurement of the two distributions as a function of the lepton $p_T$, a
direct and experimentally clean observable, would lead to a potentially
unbiased and normalization-free test of the standard model prediction. To check
the robustness of our proposal we study how the correlation is affected by
mis-measurement of the $t\bar t$ system transverse momenta, acceptance cuts,
scale dependence and compare the results of MCFM, POWHEG (with & without PYTHIA

shape of the relative differential distribution $A_{l} (p^{l}_{T})
[A_{t\bar{t}} (p^l_T)]$ is only moderately distorted hence supporting the
usefulness of our proposal. Beyond the first emission, we find that the
correlation is not accurately captured by lowest-order treatment. We also
briefly consider other differential variables such as the system transverse
mass and the canonical $t\bar t$ invariant mass. Finally, we study new physics
scenarios where the correlation is significantly distorted and therefore can be
more readily constrained or discovered using our method.

ejections (CMEs). More than 80 % of eruptions lead to a CME. This correlation
has been studied extensively during the past solar cycles and the last long
solar minimum. The statistics made on events occurring during the rising phase
of the new solar cycle 24 is in agreement with this finding. Both filaments and
CMEs have been related to twisted magnetic fields. Therefore, nearly all the
MHD CME models include a twisted flux tube, called a flux rope. Either the flux
rope is present long before the eruption, or it is built up by reconnection of
a sheared arcade from the beginning of the eruption. In order to initiate
eruptions, different mechanisms have been proposed: new emergence of flux,
and/or dispersion of the external magnetic field, and/or reconnection of field
lines below or above the flux rope. These mechanisms reduce the downward
magnetic tension and favor the rise of the flux rope. Another mechanism is the
kink instability when the configuration is twisted too much. In this paper we
open a forum of discussions revisiting observational and theoretical papers to
understand which mechanisms trigger the eruption. We conclude that all the
above quoted mechanisms could bring the flux rope to an unstable state.
However, the most efficient mechanism for CMEs is the loss-of-equilibrium or
torus instability, when the flux rope has reached an unstable threshold
determined by a decay index of the external magnetic field.

EIS obtained a full-CCD spectrum of the flare. Chromospheric evaporation
characterized by 150-200 km/s upflows was observed in multiple locations in
multi-million degree spectral lines of flare ions such as Fe XXII, Fe XXIII,

lines from ions such as Fe XII - Fe XVI. The behavior of cooler, transition
region ions such as O VI, Fe VIII, He II, and Fe X is more complex, but upflows
were also observed in Fe VIII and Fe X lines. At a point close to strong energy
input in space and time, the flare ions Fe XXII, Fe XXIII, and Fe XXIV reveal
an isothermal source with a temperature close to 14 MK and no strong
blueshifted components. At this location there is a strong downflow in cooler

single cell and within a single contiguous frequency band. Various emerging
trends reveal major shortcomings of those design criteria: 1) The fraction of
machine-type-communications (MTC) is growing fast. Transmissions of this kind
are suffering from the bulky procedures necessary to ensure strict synchronism.
2) Collaborative schemes have been introduced to boost capacity and coverage
(CoMP), and wireless networks are becoming more and more heterogeneous
following the non-uniform distribution of users. Tremendous efforts must be
spent to collect the gains and to manage such systems under the premise of
strict synchronism and orthogonality. 3) The advent of the Digital Agenda and
the introduction of carrier aggregation are forcing the transmission systems to
deal with fragmented spectrum. 5GNOW is an European research project supported
by the European Commission within FP7 ICT Call 8. It will question the design
targets of LTE and LTE-Advanced having these shortcomings in mind and the
obedience to strict synchronism and orthogonality will be challenged. It will

of extended sources in X-ray images. Our goal is to provide a flexible tool
capable of detecting extended sources down to the lowest flux levels attainable
within instrumental limitations, while maintaining robust photometry, high
completeness, and low contamination, regardless of source morphology. EXSdetect
was developed mainly to exploit the ever-increasing wealth of archival X-ray
data, but is also ideally suited to explore the scientific capabilities of
future X-ray facilities, with a strong focus on investigations of distant
groups and clusters of galaxies. Methods. EXSdetect combines a fast Voronoi
tessellation code with a friends-of-friends algorithm and an automated
deblending procedure. The values of key parameters are matched to fundamental
telescope properties such as angular resolution and instrumental background. In
addition, the software is designed to permit extensive tests of its performance
via simulations of a wide range of observational scenarios. Results. We applied
EXSdetect to simulated data fields modeled to realistically represent the Swift
X-ray Cluster Survey (SXCS), which is based on archival data obtained by the
X-ray telescope onboard the Swift satellite. We achieve more than 90%
completeness for extended sources comprising at least 80 photons in the 0.5-2
keV band, a limit that corresponds to 10^-14 erg cm^-2 s^-1 for the deepest
SXCS fields. This detection limit is comparable to the one attained by the most
sensitive cluster surveys conducted with much larger X-ray telescopes. While
evaluating the performance of EXSdetect, we also explored the impact of
improved angular resolution and discuss the ideal properties of the next
generation of X-ray survey missions.

inverse medium scattering problems, the first important step is to effectively
locate some approximate domains that contain all inhomogeneous media. Without
such an effective step, one may have to take a much larger computational domain
than actually needed in the reconstruction of all scattering objects, thus
resulting in a huge additional computational efforts. In this work we propose a
simple and efficient multilevel reconstruction algorithm to help locate an
accurate position and shape of each inhomogeneous medium. Then other existing
effective but computationally more demanding reconstruction algorithms may be
applied in these initially located computational domains to achieve more
accurate shapes of the scatter and the contrast values over each medium domain.
The new algorithm exhibits several strengths: robustness against noise,
requiring less incidences, fast convergence, flexibility to deal with
scatterers of special shapes, and advantages in computational complexity.

are applied to the stochastic model of passively advected vector field with the
most general form of the nonlinear term allowed by the Galilean symmetry. The
advecting turbulent velocity field is governed by the stochastic Navier--Stokes
equation. It is shown that the correlation functions of the passive vector
field in the inertial range exhibit anomalous scaling behaviour. The
corresponding anomalous exponents are determined by the critical dimensions of
tensor composite fields (operators) built solely of the passive vector field.
They are calculated (including the anisotropic sectors) in the leading order of
the expansion in $y$, the exponent entering the correlator of the stirring
force in the Navier--Stokes equation (one-loop approximation of the
renormalization group). The anomalous exponents exhibit an hierarchy related to
the degree of anisotropy: the less is the rank of the tensor operator, the less
is its dimension. Thus the leading terms, determined by scalar operators, are
the same as in the isotropic case, in agreement with the Kolmogorov's
hypothesis of the local isotropy restoration.

expressed in terms of a velocity field, instead of the Newtonian gravitational
acceleration field. This dynamical process involves an additional
self-interaction of the dynamical 3-space, and experimental data reveals that
its strength is set by the fine structure constant, implying a fundamental link
between gravity and quantum theory. The dynamical 3-space has been directly
detected in numerous light-speed anisotropy experiments. Quantum matter has
been shown to exhibit an acceleration caused by the time-dependence and
inhomogeneity of the 3-space flow, giving the first derivation of gravity from
a deeper theory, as a quantum wave refraction effect. EM radiation is also
refracted in a similar manner. The anisotropy experiments have all shown
3-space wave/turbulence effects, with the latest revealing the fractal
structure of 3-space. Here we report the prediction of a new effect, namely a
reverberation effect, when the gravitational waves propagate in the 3-space
inflow of a large mass. This effect arises from the non-linear dynamics of
3-space. These reverberations could offer an explanation for the Shnoll effect,
in which cosmological factors influence stochastic processes, such as
radioactive decay rates.

three great implosions: the cost of storage, the cost of bandwidth, and the

obstacles to using one-time pads to encrypt data in flight, and the final
imposition -- I mean implosion -- now makes consideration of one-time pads a
practical necessity.
  So far as assurance of confidentiality is concerned, today's block ciphers
and public key cryptosystems flunk the exam. I don't know how to recover an AES

exists no proof that another cannot. Moreover, encrypted communications can be

perceived shortcomings, and shatter the notion that secure generation,
