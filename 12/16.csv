  also equal to and faster than $C_R$","22 pages, 10 figures",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we establish a theory of Special Relativity valid for the
entire speed range without the assumption of constant speed of light. Two
particles species are defined, one species of particles have rest frames with
rest mass, and another species of particles do not have rest frame and can not
define rest mass. We prove that for the particles which have rest frames, the
Galilean transformation is the only linear transformation of space-time that
allows infinite speed of particle motion. Hence without any assumption, an
upper bound of speed is required for all non-Galilean linear transformations.
We then present a novel derivation of the mass-velocity and the mass-energy
relations in the framework of relativistic dynamics, which is solely based on
the principle of relativity and basic definitions of relativistic momentum and
energy. The generalized Lorentz transformation is then determined. The new
relativistic formulas are not related directly to the speed of light $c$, but
are replaced by a Relativity Constant $C_R$ which is an universal speed
constant of the Nature introduced in relativistic dynamics. Particles having
rest mass are called tardyons moving slower than $C_R$. Particles having
neither rest frames nor rest mass are called $tachyons$ moving faster than
$C_R$, and with the real mass-velocity relation $m=|\vec{p}_\infty
|(v^2-C_R^2)^{-1/2}$ where $\vec{p}_\infty $ is the finite momentum of tachyon
at infinite speed. Moreover, the particles with constant-speed $C_R$, also
having neither rest frames nor rest mass, are called $constons$. For all
particles, $p^2=\vec{p}^2-({E^2}/{C_R^2})$ remains invariant under
transformation between inertia frames. The invariant reads $p^2=-m_0^2C_R^2 <0$
for tardyons, $p^2 =0$ for constons and $p^2=|\vec{p}_\infty|^2 >0$ for
tachyons, respectively.

data for the Einstein equations is non-trivial. The standard method of
constructing initial data in the asymptotically flat case is to choose an
asymptotically flat 3-metric and a transverse-tracefree (TT) tensor on it. One
can find a conformal transformation that maps these data into solutions of the
constraints. In particular, the TT tensor becomes the extrinsic curvature of
the 3-slice. We wish to understand how the physical solution changes as the
free data is changed. In this paper we investigate an especially simple change:
we multiply the TT tensor by a large constant. One might assume that this
corresponds to pumping up the extrinsic curvature in the physical initial data.
Unexpectedly, we show that, while the conformal factor monotonically increases,
the physical extrinsic curvature decreases. The increase in the conformal
factor however means that the physical volume increases in such a way that the
ADM mass become unboundedly large. In turn, the blow-up of the mass combined
with the control we have on the extrinsic curvature allows us to show that
trapped surfaces, i.e., surfaces that are simultaneously future and past

the properties of the linear transformation between the LFCCs and
translationally invariant and center-of-mass Cartesian coordinates as well as
the transformation properties of the corresponding basis function parameter
matrices. By exploiting these formal mathematical relationships we can identify
and separate the translational contamination terms in the matrix representation

(1.275 M_Jup) compared to previous estimates (1.50 R_Jup and 1.52 M_Jup

re-displaced back to the single photon level and a well established

quantum state becomes entangled with that of a (microscopic) decaying nucleus.
The creation of such micro-macro entanglement is currently being pursued in
several fields, including atomic ensembles, superconducting circuits,
electro-mechanical and opto-mechanical systems. For purely optical systems,
there have been several proposals to create micro-macro entanglement by greatly
amplifying one half of an initial microscopic entangled state of light, but
experimental attempts have so far been inconclusive. Here we experimentally
demonstrate micro-macro entanglement of light. The macro system involves over a
hundred million photons, while the micro system is at the single-photon level.
We show that microscopic differences (in field quadrature measurements) on one
side are correlated with macroscopic differences (in the photon number
variance) on the other side. On the other hand, we demonstrate entanglement by
bringing the macroscopic state back to the single-photon level and performing
full quantum state tomography of the final state. Our results show that it is
possible to create and demonstrate micro-macro entanglement for unexpectedly
large photon numbers. Schroedinger's thought experiment was originally intended
to convey the absurdity of applying quantum mechanics to macroscopic objects.
Today many quantum physicists believe that quantum principles in fact apply on
all scales. By combining the present approach with other (e.g. mechanical)
systems, or by applying its basic ideas in different contexts, it may be
possible to bring quantum effects ever closer to our everyday experience.

level probabilities of default (PDs) to another average PD level that is
determined by a change of the underlying portfolio-wide PD. This paper presents
a framework that allows to explore a variety of calibration approaches and the
conditions under which they are fit for purpose. We test the approaches
discussed by applying them to publicly available datasets of agency rating and
default statistics that can be considered typical for the scope of application
of the approaches. We show that the popular 'scaled PDs' approach is
theoretically questionable and identify an alternative calibration approach
('scaled likelihood ratio') that is both theoretically sound and performs
better on the test datasets.

solve this inner problem in the case of a volatile fluid at equilibrium with

chemical species diluted in a liquid at rest, occupying the pore space with
charged solid boundaries. We study the asymptotic behavior of its solution
depending on a parameter $\beta$ which is the square of the ratio between a
characteristic pore length and the Debye length. For small $\beta$ we identify
the limit problem which is still a nonlinear Poisson equation involving only
one species with maximal valence, opposite to the average of the given surface
charge density. This result justifies the {\it Donnan effect}, observing that
the ions for which the charge is the one of the solid phase are expelled from
the pores. For large $\beta$ we prove that the solution behaves like a boundary
layer near the pore walls and is constant far away in the bulk. Our analysis is
valid for Neumann boundary conditions (namely for imposed surface charge
densities) and establishes rigorously that solid interfaces are uncoupled from
the bulk fluid, so that the simplified additive theories, such as the one of
the popular Derjaguin, Landau, Verwey and Overbeek (DLVO) approach, can be
used. We show that the asymptotic behavior is completely different in the case

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1212.1788",,,,"math.OC math.ST stat.CO stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, an alternative approximation to the innovation method is
introduced for the parameter estimation of diffusion processes from partial and

two conditional moments of the innovation process through approximate
continuous-discrete filters of minimum variance. It is shown that, for finite
samples, the resulting approximate estimators converge to the exact one when
the error of the approximate filters decreases. For an increasing number of
observations, the estimators are asymptotically normal distributed and their
bias decreases when the above mentioned error does it. A simulation study is
provided to illustrate the performance of the new estimators. The results show
that, with respect to the conventional approximate estimators, the new ones
significantly enhance the parameter estimation of the test equations. The
proposed estimators are intended for the recurrent practical situation where a
nonlinear stochastic system should be identified from a reduced number of
partial and noisy observations distant in time.

means of their infrared (IR) circumstellar shells, which show signatures of
interaction with each other. Following the systematics of the WR star
catalogues, these stars obtain the names WR\,120bb and WR\,120bc. In this
paper, we present and analyse new near-IR, $J$, $H$, and $K$-band, spectra
using the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (PoWR) model atmosphere code. For that purpose,
the atomic data base of the code has been extended in order to include all
significant lines in the near-IR bands.
  The spectra of both stars are classified as WN9h. As their spectra are very
similar the parameters that we obtained by the spectral analyses hardly differ.
Despite their late spectral subtype, we found relatively high stellar
temperatures of 63 kK. The wind composition is dominated by helium, while
hydrogen is depleted to 25 per cent by mass.
  Because of their location in the Scutum-Centaurus arm, WR\,120bb and
WR\,120bc appear highly reddened, $A_{K_{\rm s}} \approx 2$ mag. We adopt a
common distance of 5.8\,kpc to both stars, which complies with the typical
absolute $K$-band magnitude for the WN9h subtype of -6.5 mag, is consistent
with their observed extinction based on comparison with other massive stars in
the region, and allows for the possibility that their shells are interacting
with each other. This leads to luminosities of $\log(L/L_\odot) = 5.66$ and
5.54 for WR\,120bb and WR\,120bc, with large uncertainties due to the adopted
distance.
  The values of the luminosities of WR\,120bb and WR\,120bc imply that the
immediate precursors of both stars were red supergiants (RSG). This implies in
turn that the circumstellar shells associated with WR\,120bb and WR\,120bc were
formed by interaction between the WR wind and the dense material shed during
the preceding RSG phase.

methods for instrument evaluation. However, the class of possible distributions
exhibits extreme pathologies not commonly encountered in conventional
statistical analysis. To overcome these difficulties we reformulate the basic
variational problem of optimal phase measurement within a Bayesian paradigm and
employ the Shannon information as a robust figure of merit. Single-mode

the problem of finding the multi-mode performance bounds to the bounding of a

agents. Our model includes position auctions, single-minded combinatorial
auctions, and constrained matching markets. When the agents' values are drawn
from a distribution, the Bayesian optimal mechanism is given by Myerson (1981)
as a virtual-surplus optimizer. We develop a framework for prior-free mechanism
design and analysis. A good mechanism in our framework approximates the optimal
mechanism for the distribution if there is a distribution; moreover, when there
is no distribution this mechanism still performs well.
  We define and characterize optimal envy-free outcomes in symmetric
single-dimensional environments. Our characterization mirrors Myerson's theory.
Furthermore, unlike in mechanism design where there is no point-wise optimal
mechanism, there is always a point-wise optimal envy-free outcome.
  Envy-free outcomes and incentive-compatible mechanisms are similar in
structure and performance. We therefore use the optimal envy-free revenue as a
benchmark for measuring the performance of a prior-free mechanism. A good
mechanism is one that approximates the envy free benchmark on any profile of
agent values. We show that good mechanisms exist, and in particular, a natural
generalization of the random sampling auction of Goldberg et al. (2001) is a

electronic structure is distorted by inelastic scattering developing peaks/dips
and steps. These features should be detectable in the inelastic electron
tunneling spectroscopy, $d^2I/dV^2$, using local probing techniques. Inelastic
Friedel oscillations distort the spectral density at energies close to the
inelastic mode. In the strong coupling limit, a local negative $U$-center forms
in the atoms surrounding the impurity site. For those atoms, the Dirac cone
structure is fully destroyed, that is, the linear energy dispersion as well as
the V-shaped local density of electron states is completely destroyed. We
further consider the effects of the negative $U$ formation and its evolution
from weak to strong coupling. The negative $U$-site effectively acts as local
impurity such that sharp resonances appear in the local electronic structure.
The main resonances are caused by elastic scattering off the impurity site, and
the features are dressed by the presence of vibrationally activated side
resonances. Going from weak to strong coupling, changes the local electronic
structure from being Dirac cone like including midgap states, to a fully
destroyed Dirac cone with only the impurity resonances remaining.

a Quillen model structure naturally extending the classical one on differential

dominantly to its symmetry energy compared to its inner part. The symmetry
energy coefficient $a_{\text{sym}}({A})$ is then directly extracted and the
ratio of the surface symmetry coefficient to the volume symmetry coefficient
$\kappa$ is estimated. Meanwhile, with the help of experimental alpha decay

coefficient of heavy nuclei. The resultant $a_{\text{sym}}({A})$ is used to
analyze the density dependence of the symmetry energy coefficient of nuclear

observations has been well-studied in recent years. Examples include recovering
sparse or group-sparse vectors, low-rank matrices, and the sum of sparse and
low-rank matrices, among others. In various applications in signal processing
and machine learning, the model of interest is known to be structured in
several ways at the same time, for example, a matrix that is simultaneously
sparse and low-rank.
  Often norms that promote each individual structure are known, and allow for
recovery using an order-wise optimal number of measurements (e.g., $\ell_1$
norm for sparsity, nuclear norm for matrix rank). Hence, it is reasonable to
minimize a combination of such norms. We show that, surprisingly, if we use
multi-objective optimization with these norms, then we can do no better,
order-wise, than an algorithm that exploits only one of the present structures.
This result suggests that to fully exploit the multiple structures, we need an
entirely new convex relaxation, i.e. not one that is a function of the convex
relaxations used for each structure. We then specialize our results to the case
of sparse and low-rank matrices. We show that a nonconvex formulation of the
problem can recover the model from very few measurements, which is on the order
of the degrees of freedom of the matrix, whereas the convex problem obtained
from a combination of the $\ell_1$ and nuclear norms requires many more
measurements. This proves an order-wise gap between the performance of the
convex and nonconvex recovery problems in this case. Our framework applies to
arbitrary structure-inducing norms as well as to a wide range of measurement
ensembles. This allows us to give performance bounds for problems such as
sparse phase retrieval and low-rank tensor completion.

2-10, NGC 5253, and II Zw 40) were observed in the 340 GHz (880 micron) band at
5 arcsec resolution with the Submillimetre Array (SMA). Continuum emission
associated with the central star-forming complex was detected in all these
galaxies. The SMA 880 micron flux is decomposed into free-free emission and
dust emission by using centimetre-wavelength data in the literature. We find
that free-free emission contributes half or more of the SMA 880 micron flux in
the central starbursts in those three galaxies. In spite of the dominance of
free-free emission at 880 micron, the radio-to-far infrared (FIR) ratios in the
central star-forming regions are not significantly higher than those of the
entire systems, showing the robustness of radio-FIR relation. Based on the
robustness of the radio-FIR relation, we argue that the free--free fraction in
the 880 micron emission is regulated by the dust temperature. We also analyze
the CO (J = 3--2) emission data. We find that CO is a good tracer of the total
gas mass in solar-metallicity object He 2-10. Low-metallicity objects, NGC 5253
and II Zw 40, have apparently high star formation efficiencies; however, this
may be an artifact of significant dissociation of CO in the low-metallicity
environments. We also point out a potential underestimate of dust mass, since
the dust traced by emission is biased to the most luminous high-temperature
regions, particularly when a system hosts a compact star-forming region where
the dust temperature is high.

becomes metastable when the system is driven into a resonance window of the

the inflaton, leading the universe to the inflationary regime. A construction
of the resonance chart of the models is made. Resonance windows are labeled by
an integer $n \geq 2$, where $n$ is related to the ratio of the frequencies in
the scale factor/scalar field degrees of freedom. They are typically small
compared to volume of the whole parameter space, and we examine the constraints
imposed by nonlinear resonance in the physical domain of initial configurations
so that inflation may be realized. We discuss the complex dynamics arising in
this pre-inflationary stage, the structural stability of the resonance pattern

the issue of initial configurations that are connected to a chaotic exit to
inflation. Pure scalar field bouncing cosmologies are constructed. Contrary to
models with perfect fluid components, the structure of the bouncing dynamics is
highly sensitive to the initial amplitude and to the mass of the inflaton;

In case of a diatomic molecular tunnel junction, Green's function propagators
entering into current and differential conductance formula interfere
constructively for a molecular anti-bonding state and destructively for bonding
state. Consequently, conductance through a molecular bonding state is
suppressed, and to conserve current, conductance through anti-bonding state is
enhanced. Therefore, current steps and differential conductance peaks amplitude
show asymmetric correspondence between molecular bonding and anti-bonding
states. Interestingly, for a diatomic molecule, comprising of two atoms of same

preordered space has a topology and a preorder which can be recovered from the
set of continuous isotone functions. Under antisymmetry this property, also
known as quasi-uniformizability, allows one to compactify the topological space
and to extend its order dynamics. In this work we study locally compact
$\sigma$-compact spaces endowed with a closed preorder. They are known to be
normally preordered, and it is proved here that if they are locally convex,
then they are convex, in the sense that the upper and lower topologies generate
the topology. As a consequence, under local convexity they are
quasi-uniformizable. The problem of establishing local convexity under
antisymmetry is studied. It is proved that local convexity holds provided the
convex hull of any compact set is compact. Furthermore, it is proved that local
convexity holds whenever the preorder is compactly generated, a case which
includes most examples of interest, including preorders determined by cone
structures over differentiable manifolds. The work ends with some results on
the problem of quasi-pseudo-metrizability. As an application, it is shown that
every stably causal spacetime is quasi-uniformizable and every globally

Sobolev spaces $W^{1,q}(X,\sfd,\mm)$, $1<q<\infty$, in metric measure spaces
$(X,\sfd,\mm)$. In the final part of the paper we provide a new proof of the
reflexivity of the Sobolev space based on $\Gamma$-convergence; this result
extends Cheeger's work because no Poincar\'e inequality is needed and the
measure-theoretic doubling property is weakened to the metric doubling property
of the support of $\mm$. We also discuss the lower semicontinuity of the slope
of Lipschitz functions and some open problems.

imposing restrictions on matter from energy conditions we find that the

describing constraints between various nodes, groups can be formed among these
so that the resulting configuration optimizes a \emph{global} metric. In
contrast, for various social and economic networks, groups are formed \emph{de
facto} by the choices of selfish players. A fundamental problem in this setting
is the existence and convergence to a \emph{self-enforcing} configuration:
assignment of players into groups such that no player has an incentive to move
into another group than hers. Motivated by information sharing on social
networks -- and the difficult tradeoff between its benefits and the associated
privacy risk -- we study the possible emergence of such stable configurations
in a general selfish group formation game.
  Our paper considers this general game for the first time, and it completes
its analysis. We show that convergence critically depends on the level of
\emph{collusions} among the players -- which allow multiple players to move
simultaneously as long as \emph{all of them} benefit. Solving a previously open
problem we exactly show when, depending on collusions, convergence occurs
within polynomial time, non-polynomial time, and when it never occurs. We also
prove that previously known bounds on convergence time are all loose: by a
novel combinatorial analysis of the evolution of this game we are able to
provide the first \emph{asymptotically exact} formula on its convergence.
Moreover, we extend these results by providing a complete analysis when groups
may \emph{overlap}, and for general utility functions representing
\emph{multi-modal} interactions. Finally, we prove that collusions have a
significant and \emph{positive} effect on the \emph{efficiency} of the
equilibrium that is attained.

asymmetry in heavy-quark leptoproduction. Our analysis shows that large
radiative corrections to the structure functions cancel each other in their
ratio $R(x,Q^2)$ and azimuthal asymmetry with good accuracy. As a result, the
NLO contributions to the Callan-Gross ratio and $\cos(2\varphi)$ asymmetry are
less than 10% in a wide region of the variables $x$ and $Q^2$. We provide
compact analytic predictions for $R(x,Q^2)$ and asymmetry in the case of low
$x\ll 1$. Simple formulae connecting the high-energy behavior of the
Callan-Gross ratio and azimuthal asymmetry with the low-$x$ asymptotics of the
gluon density in the target are derived. It is shown that the obtained
hadron-level predictions for $R(x,Q^2)$ and azimuthal asymmetry are stable at
$x\ll 1$ under the DGLAP evolution of the gluon distribution function.
Concerning the experimental aspects, we propose to exploit the observed
perturbative stability of the Callan-Gross ratio and $\cos(2\varphi)$ asymmetry
in the extraction of the structure functions from the corresponding reduced
cross sections. In particular, our obtained analytic expressions simplify
essentially the determination of $F_2^c(x,Q^2)$ and $F_2^b(x,Q^2)$ from

in holographic gauge in the bulk, A_z = 0. The correct statement of
micro-causality in holographic gauge is somewhat subtle, so we first discuss it
from the bulk point of view. We then show that in the 1/N expansion CFT
correlators can be lifted to obtain bulk correlation functions which satisfy
micro-causality. This requires adding an infinite tower of higher-dimension
multi-trace operators to the CFT definition of a bulk observable. For conserved
currents the Ward identities in the CFT prevent the construction of truly local
bulk operators (i.e. operators that commute at spacelike separation with
everything), however the resulting non-local commutators are exactly those
required by the bulk Gauss constraint. In contrast a CFT which only has
non-conserved currents can be lifted to a bulk theory which is truly local.
Although our explicit calculations are for gauge theory, similar statements
should hold for gravity.

Universe that allow the conversion of matter into more stable states, with a
corresponding emission of relativistic matter and radiation. An example of such
a mechanism is the supernova event, that releases relativistic neutrinos
corresponding to 99% of the binding energy of remnant neutron star. We take
this phenomena as a starting point for an assumption that similar processes
could occur in the dark sector, where structure formation would generate a late
time conversion of cold dark matter into a relativistic form of dark matter. We
performed a phenomenological study about the limits of this conversion, where
we assumed a transition profile that is a generalized version of the neutrino
production in supernovae events. With this assumption, we obtained an
interesting modification for the constraint over the cold dark matter density.
We show that when comparing with the standard \Lambda CDM cosmology, there is
no preference for conversion, although the best fit is within 1\sigma\ from the
standard model best fit. The methodology and the results obtained qualify this
conversion hypothesis, from the large scale structure point of view, as a
viable and interesting model to be tested in the future with small scale data,
and mitigate discrepancies between observations at this scale and the pure cold
dark matter model.

a well-known microquasar, was studied. AIMS: Observable effects of the jet
close to the line-of-sight were investigated and interpreted within the frame
of light curve physics. METHODS: The path of a hypothetical imprint of the jet,
advected by the WR-wind, was computed and its crossing with the line-of-sight
during the binary orbit determined. We explore the possibility that physically
this 'imprint' is a formation of dense clumps triggered by jet bow shocks in
the wind (""clumpy trail""). Models for X-ray continuum and emission line light
curves were constructed using two absorbers: mass columns along the
line-of-sight of i) the WR wind and ii) the clumpy trail, as seen from the
compact star. These model light curves were compared with the observed ones
from the RXTE/ASM (continuum) and Chandra/HETG (emission lines). Results: We
show that the shapes of the Cygnus X-3 light curves can be explained by the two
absorbers using the inclination and true anomaly angles of the jet as derived
in Dubus et al. (2010) from gamma-ray Fermi/LAT observations. The clumpy trail
absorber is much larger for the lines than for the continuum. We suggest that
the clumpy trail is a mixture of equilibrium and hot (shock heated) clumps.
Conclusions: A possible way for studying jets in binary stars when the jet axis
and the line-of-sight are close to each other is demonstrated. The X-ray
continuum and emission line light curves of Cygnus X-3 can be explained by two
absorbers: the WR companion wind plus an absorber lying in the jet path (clumpy
trail). We propose that the clumpy trail absorber is due to dense clumps
triggered by jet bow shocks.

the MRI-active layer constitutes only ~ 5-10% of the total disk mass; (3) the
accretion rate (Mdot) varies radially in both magnitude and sign (inward or
outward), implying time-variable accretion as well as the creation of disk gaps
and overdensities, with consequences for planet formation and migration; (4)
achieving the empirical accretion rates in solar-type and very low mass stars
requires a depletion of well-mixed small grains by a factor of 10-1000 relative
to the standard dust-to-gas mass ratio of 10^-2; and (5) the current
non-detection of polarized emission from field-aligned grains in the outer disk
regions is consistent with active MRI at those radii.

number of linear and non-adaptive measurements, and the problem of finding a
suitable measurement matrix is very important in this field. While most recent
works focused on random matrices with entries drawn independently from certain
probability distributions, in this paper we show that a partial random
symmetric Bernoulli matrix whose entries are not independent, can be used to
recover signal from observations successfully with high probability. The
experimental results also show that the proposed matrix is a suitable
measurement matrix.

Monte-Carlo methods, is the most efficient algorithm to simulate QCD including
the effects of sea quarks. In the standard approach momentum fields are
generated with a Gaussian probability density. In this work I will explore
another possibility. By using a Lorentz distribution one can dynamically impose
a cutoff in the rate of change of the coordinates that potentially could have a
better behavior. I will present some results in pure SU(2) gauge theory.

Problem into a real-variable problem of minimizing a sum of Rational Linear
Functions constrained by an Asymptotic-Linear-Program. The coefficients and
constants in the real-variable problem are 0, 1, -1, K, or -K, where K is the
time parameter that tends to positive infinity. The number of variables,
constraints, and rational linear functions in the objective, of the
real-variable problem is bounded by a polynomial function of the size of the
NP-Complete Problem. The NP-Complete Problem has a feasible solution,
if-and-only-if, the real-variable problem has a feasible optimal objective
equal to zero. We thus show the strong NP-hardness of this real-variable
optimization problem.
