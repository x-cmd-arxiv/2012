  letter",,"10.1093/mnrasl/sls048",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The old EXOSAT medium energy measurements of high frequency (HF) AGN power
spectral normalisation are re-examined in the light of accurate black hole mass
determinations which were not available when these data were first published
(Green et al 1993). It is found that the normalised variability amplitude
(NVA), measured directly from the power spectrum, is proportional to M^{beta}
where beta ~ -0.54 +/- 0.08. As NVA is the square root of the power, these
observations show that the normalisation of the HF power spectrum for this
sample of AGN varies very close to inversely with black hole mass. Almost the
same value of $\beta$ is obtained whether the quasar 3C273 is included in the
sample or not, suggesting that the same process that drives X-ray variability
in Seyfert galaxies applies also to 3C273. These observations support the work
of Gierlinski et al (2008) who show that an almost exactly linear
anticorrelation is required if the normalisations of the HF power spectra of
AGN and X-ray binary systems are to scale similarly. These observations are
also consistent with a number of studies showing that the short timescale
variance of AGN X-ray lightcurves varies approximately inversely with mass.

Volumetric changes in cerebral pathologies like pituitary adenomas are a
critical factor in treatment decisions by physicians and in general the volume
is acquired manually. Therefore, manual slice-by-slice segmentations in
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which have been obtained at regular
intervals, are performed. In contrast to this manual time consuming
slice-by-slice segmentation process Slicer is an alternative which can be
significantly faster and less user intensive. In this contribution, we compare
pure manual segmentations of ten pituitary adenomas with semi-automatic
segmentations under Slicer. Thus, physicians drew the boundaries completely
manually on a slice-by-slice basis and performed a Slicer-enhanced segmentation
using the competitive region-growing based module of Slicer named GrowCut.
Results showed that the time and user effort required for GrowCut-based
segmentations were on average about thirty percent less than the pure manual
segmentations. Furthermore, we calculated the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC)
between the manual and the Slicer-based segmentations to proof that the two are
comparable yielding an average DSC of 81.97\pm3.39%.

Lense-Thirring effect at the surface of the Earth will be presented; the name
of the experiment is GINGER. The proposed technique is based on the behavior of
light beams in ring lasers, also known as gyrolasers. A three-dimensional array
of ringlasers will be attached to a rigid monument; each ring will have a
different orientation in space. Within the space-time of a rotating mass the
propagation of light is indeed anisotropic; part of the anisotropy is purely
kinematical (Sagnac effect), part is due to the interaction between the
gravito-electric field of the source and the kinematical motion of the observer
(de Sitter effect), finally there is a contribution from the gravito-magnetic
component of the Earth (gravito-magnetic frame dragging or Lense-Thirring
effect). In a ring laser a light beam traveling counterclockwise is superposed
to another beam traveling in the opposite sense. The anisotropy in the
propagation leads to standing waves with slightly different frequencies in the
two directions; the final effect is a beat frequency proportional to the size
of the instrument and its effective rotation rate in space, including the
gravito-magnetic drag. Current laser techniques and the performances of the
best existing ring lasers allow at the moment a sensitivity within one order of
magnitude of the required accuracy for the detection of gravito-magnetic
effects, so that the objective of GINGER is in the range of feasibility and
aims to improve the sensitivity of a couple of orders of magnitude with respect
to present. The experiment will be underground, probably in the Gran Sasso
National Laboratories in Italy, and is based on an international collaboration
among four Italian groups, the Technische Universitaet Muenchen and the

in multivariate analysis. This paper considers adaptive minimax estimation of
sparse precision matrices in the high dimensional setting. Optimal rates of
convergence are established for a range of matrix norm losses. A fully data
driven estimator based on adaptive constrained $\ell_1$ minimization is
proposed and its rate of convergence is obtained over a collection of parameter
spaces. The estimator, called ACLIME, is easy to implement and performs well
numerically.
  A major step in establishing the minimax rate of convergence is the
derivation of a rate-sharp lower bound. A ""two-directional"" lower bound
technique is applied to obtain the minimax lower bound. The upper and lower
bounds together yield the optimal rates ofconvergence for sparse precision
matrix estimation and show that the ACLIME estimator is adaptively minimax rate
optimal for a collection of parameter spaces and a range of matrix norm losses
simultaneously.

through the near-infrared arm of the X-Shooter data and a spectral type of
dL4-dL7 was estimated using standard spectral indices. Combined radial velocity
measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, X-Shooter and the Hobby-Eberly

period of the binary was measured as 101.88+/-0.02 mins using both the radial
velocity data and i'-band variability detected with the INT. This variability
indicates 'day' side heating of the brown dwarf companion. We also observe
H{\alpha} emission in our higher resolution data in phase with the white dwarf
radial velocity, indicating this system is in a low level of accretion, most
likely via a stellar wind. This system represents the shortest period white

envelope evolution, much like its longer period counterpart, WD0137-349. Both

due to truncation errors are between one and three orders of magnitude lower in
the Z4c evolutions. Improvements are also found in the accuracy of the computed
gravitational radiation. For equal-mass irrotational binary neutron star
evolutions we find that the absolute errors in phase and amplitude of the
waveforms can be up to a factor of four smaller. The quality of the Z4c
numerical data is also demonstrated by a remarkably accurate computation of the
ADM mass from surface integrals. For equal-mass non-spinning binary puncture
black hole evolutions we find that the absolute errors in phase and amplitude

we find that away from the punctures the Hamiltonian constraint violation is
reduced by between one and two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the utility of
gravitational radiation controlling, constraint preserving boundary conditions
for the Z4c formulation is demonstrated. The evolution of spacetimes containing
a single compact object confirm earlier results in spherical symmetry. The
boundary conditions avoid spurious and non-convergent effects present in high

features that enable sophisticated and practically useful modeling. However,
the use of these features has been severely restricted in order to retain
decidability of the language. For example, OWL 2 DL does not allow a property
to be both transitive and asymmetric, which would be desirable, e.g., for
representing an ancestor relation. In this paper, we argue that the so-called
global restrictions of OWL 2 DL preclude many useful forms of modeling, by
providing a catalog of basic modeling patterns that would be available in OWL 2
DL if the global restrictions were discarded. We then report on the results of
evaluating several state-of-the-art OWL 2 DL reasoners on problems that use
combinations of features in a way that the global restrictions are violated.
The systems turn out to rely heavily on the global restrictions and are thus
largely incapable of coping with the modeling patterns. Next we show how
off-the-shelf first-order logic theorem proving technology can be used to
perform reasoning in the OWL 2 direct semantics, the semantics that underlies
OWL 2 DL, but without requiring the global restrictions. Applying a naive
proof-of-concept implementation of this approach to the test problems was
successful in all cases. Based on our observations, we make suggestions for
future lines of research on expressive description logic-style OWL reasoning.

  overlap with arXiv:1212.2067",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Steganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way
that no one apart from the sender and the receiver would realize that a secret
communicating is taking place. Unlike cryptography which only scrambles secret
data keeping them overt, steganography covers secret data into medium files
such as image files and transmits them in total secrecy avoiding drawing
eavesdroppers suspicions. However, considering that the public channel is
monitored by eavesdroppers, it is vulnerable to stego-attacks which refer to
randomly trying to break the medium file and recover the secret data out of it.
That is often true because steganalysts assume that the secret data are encoded
into a single medium file and not into multiple ones that complement each
other. This paper proposes a text steganography method for hiding secret
textual data using two mediums; a Pangram sentence containing all the
characters of the alphabet, and an uncompressed image file. The algorithm tries
to search for every character of the secret message into the Pangram text. The
search starts from a random index called seed and ends up on the index of the
first occurrence of the character being searched for. As a result, two indexes
are obtained, the seed and the offset indexes. Together they are embedded into
the three LSBs of the color channels of the image medium. Ultimately, both
mediums mainly the Pangram and the image are sent to the receiver. The
advantage of the proposed method is that it makes the covert data hard to be
recovered by unauthorized parties as it uses two mediums, instead of one, to
deliver the secret data. Experiments conducted, illustrated an example that
explained how to encode and decode a secret text message using the Pangram and
the image mediums.

analyze in detail in an exact quantum mechanical treatment of the problem. The
bipartite setup of only one atomic quantum dot coupled to a pool of bosons
turns out to be equivalent to two qubits which easily get entangled being
initially in a product state. We show that both the number of bosons in the
pool and the boson-boson interaction crucially affect the entanglement
characteristics of the system. The tripartite system of two atomic quantum dots
and a pool of bosons reduces to a qubit-qutrit-qubit realization. We consider
entanglement possibilities of the pure system as well as of reduced ones by
tracing out one of the constituents, and show how the entanglement can be
controlled by varying system parameters. We demonstrate that the qutrit, as
expected, plays a leading role in entangling of the two qubits and the maximum
entanglement depends in a nontrivial way on the pool characteristics.

and three tests which reject false positives. Each target containing at least
one detected signal is then searched repeatedly for additional signals, which
represent multi-planet systems of transiting planets. When targets with
multiple detections are considered, a total of 18,406 potential transiting
planet signals are found in the Kepler Mission dataset. The detected signals
are dominated by events with relatively low signal-to-noise ratios and by
events with relatively short periods. The distribution of estimated transit
depths appears to peak in the range between 20 and 30 parts per million, with a
few detections down to fewer than 10 parts per million. The detections exhibit
signal-to-noise ratios from 7.1 sigma, which is the lower cut-off for

approached in terms of boundary data on null hypersurfaces. This has
far-reaching effects on the basic notions of classical and quantum mechanics,
such as Hamiltonians and canonical conjugates. Such radical properties are not
unexpected in finite-region quantum gravity. We are thus motivated to
reformulate field theory in terms of null boundary data. As a starting point,
we consider the on-shell action functional for classical field theory in finite
null-bounded regions. Closed-form results are obtained for free scalars and for
Maxwell fields. The action of classical gravity is also discussed, to the
extent possible without solving the field equations. These action functionals
exhibit non-locality and, in special cases, a ""holographic"" reduction of the
degrees of freedom. Also, they cannot be used to define global charges. Whereas
for ordinary field theory these are just artifacts of a restrictive formalism,
in quantum gravity they are expected to be genuine features. This further
supports a connection between quantum gravity and null-boundary observables. In
our treatment of the GR action, we identify a universal imaginary term that
reproduces the Bekenstein entropy formula.

potentially allowing to test the standard Big Bang model as well as less
conventional approaches including noncyclic pre-Big Bang cosmologies that would
incorporate a new fundamental scale beyond the Planck scale and, possibly, new
ultimate constituents of matter. Alternatives to standard physics can be
considered from a cosmological point of view concerning vacuum structure, the
nature of space-time, the origin and evolution of our Universe, the validity of
quantum field theory and conventional symmetries, solutions to the cosmological
constant problem, inflationary scenarios, dark matter and dark energy, the
interpretation of string-like theories... Lorentz-like symmetries for the
properties of matter (standard or superbradyonic) can then be naturally stable
space-time configurations resulting from general cosmological scenarios that
incorporate physics beyond the Planck scale and describe the formation and
evolution of the present vacuum. But an even more primordial question seems to
be that of the origin of half-integer spins, that cannot be generated through
orbital angular momentum in the usual real space-time. It turns out that the
use of a spinorial space-time with two complex coordinates instead of the
conventional four real ones presents several attractive features. Taking the
cosmic time to be the modulus of a SU(2) spinor leads by purely geometric means
to a naturally expanding universe, with a ratio between cosmic relative
velocities and distances equal to the inverse of the age of the Universe. No
reference to standard matter, hidden fields, gravitation or relativity is
required to get such a result that looks quite reasonable from an observational
point of view. We discuss basic ideas and phenomenological issues for noncyclic

the twin prime conjecture, can be understood by examining sums or differences
of a set with itself. A finite set $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is considered
sum-dominant if $|A+A|>|A-A|$. If we consider all subsets of ${0, 1, ...,
n-1}$, as $n\to\infty$ it is natural to expect that almost all subsets should
be difference-dominant, as addition is commutative but subtraction is not;
however, Martin and O'Bryant in 2007 proved that a positive percentage are
sum-dominant as $n\to\infty$.
  This motivates the study of ""coordinate sum dominance"". Given $V \subset
(\Z/n\Z)^2$, we call $S:={x+y: (x,y) \in V}$ a coordinate sumset and $D:=\{x-y:
(x,y) \in V\}$ a coordinate difference set, and we say $V$ is coordinate sum
dominant if $|S|>|D|$. An arithmetically interesting choice of $V$ is
$\bar{H}_2(a;n)$, which is the reduction modulo $n$ of the modular hyperbola
$H_2(a;n) := {(x,y): xy \equiv a \bmod n, 1 \le x,y < n}$. In 2009, Eichhorn,
Khan, Stein, and Yankov determined the sizes of $S$ and $D$ for
$V=\bar{H}_2(1;n)$ and investigated conditions for coordinate sum dominance. We
extend their results to reduced $d$-dimensional modular hyperbolas
$\bar{H}_d(a;n)$ with $a$ coprime to $n$.

von Neumann algebra of U(n), which is then restricted to the center.
Additionally, the restriction to a maximal torus can be expressed in terms of
weight multiplicities, explaining the presence of tensor products.

exposed to strong heating of the bottom and cooling of the top plate in the
absence of inertia effects. While the dynamics in the bulk are characterized by
a chaotic convective heat flow, the boundary layers at the horizontal container
plates are essentially conducting and thus the fluid is motionless.
Consequently, the average temperature exhibits a linear profile in the boundary
layers.
  In this article, we rigorously investigate the average temperature and
oscillations in the boundary layer via local bounds on the temperature field.
Moreover, we deduce that the temperature profile is indeed essentially linear
close to the horizontal container plates. Our results are uniform in the system
parameters (e.g. the Rayleigh number) up to logarithmic correction terms. An
important tool in our analysis is a new Hardy-type estimate for the convecting
velocity field, which can be used to control the fluid motion in the layer. The
bounds on the temperature field are derived with the help of local maximal
regularity estimates for convection-diffusion equations.

generated at enhanced singularities in higher codimension. We construct the
resolution of the singular Tate form for an elliptic Calabi-Yau four-fold with
an ADE type singularity in codimension 1 and study the structure of the fibers

general are of Kodaira type along minimal singular loci, and are thus
consistent with the low energy gauge-theoretic intuition. Furthermore, we
provide a complementary description of the fibers in higher codimension, which
will also be applicable to non-minimal singularities. The irreducible
components in the fiber in codimension 2 correspond to weights of
representations of the ADE gauge group. These can split further in codimension
3 in a way that is consistent with the generation of Yukawa couplings. Applying
this reasoning, we then venture out to study non-minimal singularities, which
occur for A type along codimension 3, and for D and E also in codimension 2.
The fibers in this case are non-Kodaira, however some insight into these
singularities can be gained by considering the splitting of fiber components
along higher codimension, which are shown to be consistent with matter and

time scale separation and dynamic heterogeneity, i.e. non-trivial
spatio-temporal fluctuations of the local relaxation to equilibrium, one of the
central aspects of glassy dynamics. For any mesoscopic length scale
$L=O(q^{-\gamma})$, $\gamma<1$, we show that the characteristic time scale
associated to two length scales $d/q^\gamma$ and $d'/q^\gamma$ are indeed
separated by a factor $q^{-a}$, $a=a(\gamma)>0$, provided that $d'/d$ is large
enough independently of $q$. In particular, the evolution of mesoscopic
domains, i.e. maximal blocks of the form $111..10$, occurs on a time scale

heterogeneity. Finally we show that no form of time scale separation can occur

fraction of obscured (log N_H >= 22) objects in the sample is ~60%, and 43--56%

  The soft excess is either well-detected in AGN or undetected, suggesting that
the process responsible for producing the soft excess is not ubiquitous. The
fraction of Compton-thick sources in our sample is ~9%, and `hidden/buried AGN'
constitute ~14% of our sample. Compton reflection is found to be important in a
large fraction of our sample using joint XMM-Newton+BAT fits (reflection
amplitude <R> = 2.7 +/- 0.75), indicating light bending or extremely complex
absorption. The average 1--10keV spectrum for the sample reproduces the
1--10keV X-ray background slope as found for the 9-month BAT AGN sample. The
completeness limit for the sample is ~4 times fainter than that for the 9-month

able to produce realistic galaxies, but the largest hurdle remaining is in
constructing subgrid models that accurately describe the behavior of stellar
feedback. As an alternate way to test and calibrate such models, we propose to
focus on the circumgalactic medium. To do so, we generate a suite of
adaptive-mesh refinement (AMR) simulations for a Milky-Way-massed galaxy run to
z=0, systematically varying the feedback implementation. We then post-process
the simulation data to compute the absorbing column density for a wide range of
common atomic absorbers throughout the galactic halo, including H I, Mg II, Si
II, Si III, Si IV, C IV, N V, O VI, and O VII. The radial profiles of these
atomic column densities are compared against several quasar absorption line
studies, to determine if one feedback prescription is favored. We find that
although our models match some of the observations (specifically those ions
with lower ionization strengths), it is particularly difficult to match O VI
observations. There is some indication that the models with increased feedback
intensity are better matches. We demonstrate that sufficient metals exist in
these halos to reproduce the observed column density distribution in principle,
but the simulated circumgalactic medium lacks significant multiphase
substructure and is generally too hot. Furthermore, we demonstrate the failings
of inflow-only models (without energetic feedback) at populating the CGM with
adequate metals to match observations even in the presence of multiphase
structure. Additionally, we briefly investigate the evolution of the CGM from
z=3 to present. Overall, we find that quasar absorption line observations of
the gas around galaxies provide a new and important constraint on feedback
models.

scientific mysteries. Although successfully describing large scales, the
standard cold dark matter model (CDM) exhibits possible shortcomings on
galactic and sub-galactic scales. It is exactly at these highly non-linear
scales where strong astrophysical constraints can be set on the nature of the
dark matter particle. While observations of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest probe the
matter power spectrum in the mildly non-linear regime, satellite galaxies of
the Milky Way provide an excellent laboratory as a test of the underlying
cosmology on much smaller scales. Here we present results from a set of high
resolution simulations of a Milky Way sized dark matter halo in eight distinct
cosmologies: CDM, warm dark matter (WDM) with a particle mass of 2 keV and six
different cold plus warm dark matter (C+WDM) models, varying the fraction,
$f_{\rm wdm}$, and the mass, $m_{\rm wdm}$, of the warm component. We used
three different observational tests based on Milky Way satellite observations:
the total satellite abundance, their radial distribution and their mass
profile. We show that the requirement of simultaneously satisfying all three
constraints sets very strong limits on the nature of dark matter. This shows
the power of a multi-dimensional small scale approach in ruling out models
which would be still allowed by large scale observations.

perform a BBN calculation including PMF effects, and show abundances as a

constrained from observational constraints on abundances of $^4$He and D. The
minimum abundance of $^7$Li/H as a function of $\eta$ slightly moves to a
higher $^7$Li/H value at a larger $\eta$ value when a PMF exists during BBN. We
then discuss degeneracies between the PL-PMF parameters in the PMF effect. In
addition, we assume a general case in which both the existence and the

so-called 'type II' spicules may have a role in providing mass to the corona
and the solar wind. In chromospheric filtergrams these spicules are not seen to
fall back down, and they are shorter-lived and more dynamic than the spicules
that have been classically reported in ground-based observations. Observations
of type II spicules with Hinode show fundamentally different properties from
what was previously measured. In earlier work we showed that these dynamic type
II spicules are the most common type, a view that was not properly identified
by early observations.The aim of this work is to investigate the effects of
spatio-temporal resolution in the classical spicule measurements. Making use of
Hinode data degraded to match the observing conditions of older ground-based
studies, we measure the properties of spicules with a semi-automated algorithm.
These results are then compared to measurements using the original Hinode data.
We find that degrading the data has a significant effect on the measured
properties of spicules. Most importantly, the results from the degraded data
agree well with older studies (e.g. mean spicule duration more than 5 minutes,
and upward apparent velocities of about 25 km/s). These results illustrate how
the combination of spicule superposition, low spatial resolution and cadence
affect the measured properties of spicules, and that previous measurements can
be misleading.

depth at existing IRAC color diagnostics, and we explore new color-color

combinations provide the most detail about the shape of a source's IR spectrum.
An added benefit of using a color that combines far-IR and mid-IR photometry is
that it is indicative of the power source driving the IR luminosity. For our

provides the basis for the IP-Glasma model of initial conditions in heavy ion

the hybridization of zinc and oxygen orbitals can result in an impurity state

The low-energy, spin-only Hamiltonian includes terms of the order t^2/U and

J-terms of order t^2/U, the low-energy model contains impurity-mediated,
further-neighbor frustrating interactions among the Cu spins surrounding
Zn-sites in an otherwise unfrustrated antiferromagnetic background. These terms
can be substantial when \varepsilon ~ U/2, the latter value corresponding to
the realistic CuO2 parameters. In order to verify this spin-only model, we
subsequently apply the T-matrix approach to study the effect of impurities on
the antiferromagnetic order parameter. Previous theoretical studies, which
include only the dilution effect of impurities, show a large discrepancy with
experimental data in the doping dependence of the staggered magnetization at
low doping. We demonstrate that this discrepancy is eliminated by including
impurity-induced frustrations into the effective spin model with realistic CuO2
parameters. Recent experimental study shows a significantly stronger
suppression of spin stiffness in the case of Zn-doped La2CuO4 compared to the

estimates of the virial radius, R200, for galaxies of different morphological
types and wide range of stellar mass. I show that over eight of orders of
magnitude in stellar mass galaxies of all morphological types follow an
approximately linear relation between 3D half-mass radius of their stellar
distribution, rhalf and virial radius, rhalf~0.015R200 with a scatter of ~0.2
dex. Such scaling is in remarkable agreement with expectation of models which
assume that galaxy sizes are controlled by halo angular momentum, which implies
rhalf\propto lambda R200, where lambda is the spin of galaxy parent halo. The
scatter about the relation is comparable with the scatter expected from the
distribution of $\lambda$ and normalization of the relation agrees with that
predicted by the model of Mo, Mao & White (1998), if galaxy sizes were set on
average at z~1-2. Moreover, I show that when stellar and gas surface density
profiles of galaxies of different morphological types are rescaled using radius
r_n= 0.015 R200, the rescaled surface density profiles follow approximately
universal exponential (for late types) and de Vaucouleurs (for early types)

tests on randomly selected low-magnitude subsets, and check that a dataset of
~190 observations, same size as the French dataset, is large enough to obtain
stable LLH estimates. Additionally we perform the tests against larger
magnitudes (5-7) from the Japanese dataset. The ranking of models is partially
modified, indicating a magnitude scaling effect for some of the models, and
showing that extrapolating testing results obtained from low magnitude ranges
to higher magnitude ranges is not straightforward.

characterisation of quantum systems, be they states, processes or measurements,
particularly for the purposes of trouble-shooting and benchmarking experiments
in quantum information science. A range of techniques exist to enable the
calculation of errors, such as Monte-Carlo simulations, but their quantitative
value is arguably fundamentally flawed without an equally rigorous way of
authenticating the quality of a reconstruction to ensure it provides a
reasonable representation of the data, given the known noise sources. A key
motivation for developing such a tool is to enable experimentalists to
rigorously diagnose the presence of technical noise in their tomographic data.
In this work, I explore the performance of the chi-squared goodness-of-fit test
statistic as a measure of reconstruction quality. I show that its behaviour
deviates noticeably from expectations for states lying near the boundaries of
physical state space, severely undermining its usefulness as a quantitative
tool precisely in the region which is of most interest in quantum information
processing tasks. I suggest a simple, heuristic approach to compensate for
these effects and present numerical simulations showing that this approach
provides substantially improved performance.

interaction with melts. In the melt-infiltration process explored here, the
primary mechanism for weakening and rejuvenating the plate is through thermal

speculate on the nature and geometry of a melt-modulated interaction zone
between lithosphere and asthenosphere and the seismically-observable
consequences of variable melt-infiltration into the margins of regions of
thick, stable lithosphere such as the Colorado Plateau and the Archean Wyoming

of the uniqueness result on $\mathbb{R}^3$ previously proved by Klainerman and
Machedon, except that, in the periodic setting, we need to assume additional

the number of lattice points which lie in the intersection of a plane and a set

dark matter community, were previously unavailable. Purpose: Measure the
differential cross section for elastic scattering of neutrons from argon and
neon in the energy range relevant to backgrounds from (alpha,n) reactions in
direct dark matter searches. Method: Cross-section data were taken at the
Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory (TUNL) using the neutron
time-of-flight technique. These data were fit using the spherical optical
model. Results: The differential cross section for elastic scatting of neutrons
from neon at 5.0 and 8.0 MeV and argon at 6.0 MeV was measured. Optical-model
parameters for the elastic scattering reactions were determined from the best
fit to these data. The total elastic scattering cross section for neon was
found to differ by 6% at 5.0 MeV and 13% at 8.0 MeV from global optical-model
predictions. Compared to a local optical-model for 40Ar, the elastic scattering
cross section was found to differ from the data by 8% at 6.0 MeV. Conclusions:
These new data are important for improving Monte-Carlo simulations and

direct-gap semiconductors the photon recycling process can radically modify the
spatial spread. For this process, the steps in the random walk are defined by
the reabsorption length of photons produced in radiative recombination. The
step distribution has an asymptotic power-law decline. Moments of this
distribution diverge and the displacement is governed by rare but large steps.
Random walk of this kind is called the Levy flight. It corresponds to an
anomalously large spread in space and a modified (""super-diffusive"") temporal
evolution. Here we discuss the first direct observation of the hole profile in
n-doped InP samples over distances of the order of a centimeter and more than
two orders of magnitude in hole concentration. Luminescence spectra and
intensity were studied as a function of distance from the photo-excitation in a
rather unusual geometry (homogeneous excitation of the wafer edge and
observation of the luminescence spectra from the broadside). The intensity is
proportional to the minority-carrier concentration and exhibits a slow
power-law drop-off with no changes in the spectral shape. This power law gives
a direct evidence of Levy-flight transport. It has enabled us to evaluate the
index of the distribution, the characteristic distance of the minority-carrier
spread and the photon recycling factor. The results are in good agreement with
the theoretical analysis.

resonance in the presence of a three-dimensional lattice potential. By
expressing a two-channel model of the resonance in the basis of Bloch states
appropriate for the lattice, we derive an eigenvalue equation for the
two-particle bound states which is nonlinear in the energy eigenvalue. Compact
expressions for the interchannel matrix elements, numerical methods for the
solution of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem, and a renormalization procedure
to remove ultraviolet divergences are presented. From the structure of the
two-body solutions we identify the relevant degrees of freedom which describe
the resonance behavior in the lowest Bloch band. These degrees of freedom,
which we call dressed molecules, form an effective closed channel in a
many-body model of the resonance, the Fermi resonance Hamiltonian (FRH). It is
shown how the properties of the FRH can be determined numerically by solving a
projected lattice two-channel model at the two-particle level. As opposed to
single-channel lattice models such as the Hubbard model, the FRH is valid for
general s-wave scattering length and resonance width. Hence, the FRH provides
an accurate description of the BEC-BCS crossover for ultracold fermions on an
optical lattice.

component estimated using an AGN empirical correlation and multi-frequency SED
fits, we obtain average star formation rates (SFRs) of 7+/-7 and 20+/-50

than the SFRs reported in the literature for different samples of non-active

position and width of the $d$ bands. The plasmon dispersions calculated with
the latter xc-potential agree well with electron energy loss spectroscopy

found for the plasmon energies and is attributed to the reduced screening by
interband transitions from Cu, to Au and Ag. This trend for the ASP, however,
contradicts a previous model prediction. While the ASP is seen as a weak
feature in the EELS, it can be clearly identified in the static and dynamic

whose classification is G2 V with (b-y)o=0.3927+/-0.0190, (m1)o =

however, (m1)o differs from a recent model-based value for this index derived

tunneling model discussed here is based on coherent, Josephson-like tunneling
of microscopic quantum solitons of charge 2e. The model interprets the CDW
threshold electric field as a Coulomb blockade threshold for soliton pair
creation, often much smaller than the classical depinning field but with the
same impurity dependence (e.g., ~ ni^2 for for weak pinning). This picture
draws upon the theory of time-correlated single-electron tunneling to interpret
CDW dynamics above threshold. Similar to Feynman's derivation of the Josephson
current-phase relation for a superconducting tunnel junction, the picture
treats the Schrodinger equation as an emergent classical equation to describe
the time-evolution of Josephson-coupled order parameters related to soliton
dislocation droplets. Vector or time-varying scalar potentials can affect the
order parameter phases to enable magnetic quantum interference in CDW rings or
lead to interesting behavior in response to oscillatory electric fields. The
ability to vary both magnitudes and phases is an aspect important to future
applications in quantum computing.

dispersion and damping are obtained in both retarded ($\omega/k_z\sim c$) and

that the plasma spatial dispersion significantly affects the properties of
SPPs, especially at short wavelengths (less than the collisionless skin depth,
$\lambda\lesssim c/\omega_{pe}$). Namely, the collisionless (Landau) damping of
SPPs (due to spatial dispersion) is comparable to the purely collisional

democracies, what sort of regimes will eventually emerge from the crisis
remains far from certain. Here we provide a complex systems framework,
validated by historical precedent, to help answer this question. We describe
the dynamics of governmental change as an evolutionary process similar to
biological evolution, in which complex organizations gradually arise by
replication, variation and competitive selection. Different kinds of
governments, however, have differing levels of complexity. Democracies must be
more systemically complex than autocracies because of their need to incorporate
large numbers of people in decision-making. This difference has important
implications for the relative robustness of democratic and autocratic
governments after revolutions. Revolutions may disrupt existing evolved
complexity, limiting the potential for building more complex structures
quickly. Insofar as systemic complexity is reduced by revolution, democracy is
harder to create in the wake of unrest than autocracy. Applying this analysis
to the Middle East and North Africa, we infer that in the absence of stable
institutions or external assistance, new governments are in danger of facing
increasingly insurmountable challenges and reverting to autocracy.

dune formation, dust entrainment and for a rich diversity of patterns on the
bottom of oceans, rivers, and planetary surfaces. Most previous models of
sediment transport have focused on the equilibrium (or saturated) particle
flux. However, the morphodynamics of sediment landscapes emerging due to
surface transport of sediment is controlled by situations out-of-equilibrium.
In particular, it is controlled by the saturation length characterizing the
distance it takes for the particle flux to reach a new equilibrium after a
change in flow conditions. The saturation of mass density of particles
entrained into transport and the relaxation of particle and fluid velocities
constitute the main relevant relaxation mechanisms leading to saturation of the
sediment flux. Here we present a theoretical model for sediment transport
which, for the first time, accounts for both these relaxation mechanisms and
for the different types of sediment entrainment prevailing under different
environmental conditions. Our analytical treatment allows us to derive a closed
expression for the saturation length of sediment flux, which is general and can
thus be applied under different physical conditions.

is being used to bridge the gap between the test objective and test cases,
derived from the specification of the system. Since, a state chart derived from
the combination of sequence diagrams can model the entire behavior of the

morphology of globular clusters (GCs). It has been found, however, that some
other parameters may also play an important role in affecting the morphology.
While the nature of these important parameters remains unclear, they are
believed to be likely correlated with wind mass-loss of red giants, since this
mass loss determines their subsequent locations on the HB. Unfortunately, the
mass loss during the red giant stages of the stellar evolution is poorly
understood at present. The stellar winds of red giants may be tidally enhanced
by companion stars if they are in binary systems. We investigate evolutionary
consequences of red giants in binaries by including tidally enhanced stellar
winds, and examine the effects on the HB morphology of GCs. We find that red,
blue, and extreme horizontal branch stars are all produced under the effects of
tidally enhanced stellar wind without any additional assumptions on the
mass-loss dispersion. Furthermore, the horizontal branch morphology is found to
be insensitive to the tidal enhancement parameter, Bw. We compare our
theoretical results with the observed horizontal branch morphology of globular
cluster NGC 2808, and find that the basic morphology of the horizontal branch

is formulated in a suitable function space. The free kinetic operator, whose
inverse gives the propagators of the in-in perturbation theory, becomes
essentially self adjoint after imposing appropriate boundary conditions. An
explicit spectral representation is given for the scalar in the flat space and
the standard propagators are rederived using this representation. In this way
the subtle boundary path integral over the field configurations at the return
time is handled straightforwardly. It turns out that not only the values of the
forward (+) and the backward (-) evolving fields but also their time
derivatives must be matched at the return time, which is mainly overlooked in
the literature. This formulation also determines the field configurations that
are included in the path integral uniquely. We show that some of the recently
suggested instanton-like solutions corresponding to the stationary phases of
the cosmological in-in path integrals can be rigorously identified as limits of
sequences in the function space.

epsilon=0.3-0.9 and M_{BH}=10^{7-8.5}M_odot, where epsilon is the Eddington
ratio and M_{BH} is the black hole mass. Thus, the absorption features are
observed for an observer of which a viewing angle is around 50^{circ}. A
probability of BAL quasars is 7-11%, which is roughly consistent the abundance
ratio of BAL quasars, 10-15%. Here, the probability is estimated by the solid
angle, that the absorbing features would be detected, divided by 4pi. In
contrast, if the Eddington ratio is smaller than 0.01 or if the black hole is
very massive, M_{BH} < 10^9M_{odot}, the disk wind is not launched due to the
less effective line force. Then, the quasars are identified as non-BAL quasars

mean field theory yields a self-consistent condition for the synchrony and
enables us to study the effects of synaptic connections for the behavior of
neural networks. Then, we have obtained a condition of synaptic connections for
the synchrony with the cycle time $T$. The neurons in neural networks receive
sensory inputs and top-down inputs from outside of the network. When the
network neurons receive two or more inputs, their synchronization depends on
the conditions of inputs. We have also analyzed this case using the mean field
theory. As a result, we clarified the following points: (1) The stronger
synaptic connections enhance the shorter synchrony cycle of neurons. (2) The
cycle of the synchrony becomes longer as the cycle of external inputs becomes
longer. (3) The relationships among synaptic weights, the properties of input
trains, and the cycle of synchrony are expressed by one equation, and there are
two areas for asynchrony. In association with the third point, the yielded

from combining the density and temperature provided by X-ray observations of
the thermal bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by the plasma. We find a
model-independent tension between the SZ and the X-ray pressure, with the SZ
one being definitely lower by 15-20%. We propose that such a challenging
tension can be resolved in terms of an additional, non-thermal support to the
gravitational equilibrium of the intracluster plasma. This can be
straightforwardly included in our Supermodel, so as to fit in detail the Planck
SZ profile while being consistent with the X-ray observables. Possible origins
of the nonthermal component include cosmic-ray protons, ongoing turbulence, and
relativistic electrons; given the existing observational constraints on the
first two options, here we focus on the third. For this to be effective, we
find that the electron population must include not only an energetic tail
accelerated to gamma> 10^3 responsible for the Coma radiohalo, but also many
more, lower energy electrons. The electron acceleration is to be started by
merging events similar to those which provided the very high central entropy of

in the mid-seventeenth century and were extensively studied for their novel
sympathetic oscillation dynamics. In this era of nanotechnologies, coupled
oscillations have again emerged as subjects of interest when realized in
nanomechanical resonators for both practical applications and fundamental
studies. However, a key obstacle to the further development of this
architecture is the ability to coherently manipulate the coupled oscillations.
This limitation arises as a consequence of the usually weak coupling between
the constituent nanomechanical elements. Here, we report parametrically coupled
mechanical resonators in which the coupling strength can be dynamically
adjusted by modulating (pumping) the stress in the mechanical elements via a
piezoelectric transducer. The parametric control enables the coupling rate
between the two resonators to be made so strong that it exceeds their intrinsic
energy dissipation rate by more than a factor of four. This ultra-strong
coupling can be exploited to coherently transfer phonon populations, namely
phonon Rabi oscillations, between the resonators via two coupled vibration
modes, realizing superposition states of the two modes and their time-domain
control. More unexpectedly, the nature of the parametric coupling can also be
tuned from a linear first-order interaction to a non-linear higher-order
process in which more than one pump phonon mediates the coherent oscillations.
This demonstration of multi-pump phonon mixing echoes multi-wave photon mixing
and suggests that concepts from non-linear optics can also be applied to
mechanical systems. Ultimately, the parametric pumping is not only useful for
controlling classical oscillations but can also be extended to the quantum
regime, opening up the prospect of entangling two distinct macroscopic
mechanical objects.

controversial. In the early 2000s two distinct differential equations of motion
were proposed. Besides their contrasting formulations for the acceleration of
condensate, the equations differ concerning the presence/absence of a term
equal to the rate of phase transitions multiplied by the difference in velocity
between condensate and air. This term was interpreted in the literature as the
""reactive motion"" associated with condensation. The reasoning behind this
""reactive motion"" was that when water vapor condenses and droplets begin to
fall the remaining gas must move upwards to conserve momentum. Here we show
that the two contrasting formulations imply distinct assumptions about how
gaseous air and condensate particles interact. We show that these assumptions
cannot be simultaneously applicable to condensation and evaporation. ""Reactive
motion"" leading to an upward acceleration of air during condensation does not
exist. The ""reactive motion"" term can be justified for evaporation only; it
describes the downward acceleration of air. We emphasize the difference between
the equations of motion (i.e., equations constraining velocity) and those
constraining momentum (i.e., equations of motion and continuity combined). We
show that, owing to the imprecise nature of the continuity equations,
consideration of total momentum can be misleading and that this led to the
""reactive motion"" controversy. Finally, we provide a revised and generally
applicable equation for the motion of moist air.

certain intermediate level of activity in order to keep away from the regimes
of chaos and silence. Strong evidence for criticality has been observed in
terms of spatio-temporal activity avalanches first in cultures of rat cortex by
Beggs and Plenz (2003) and subsequently in many more experimental setups. These
findings sparked intense research on theoretical models for criticality and
avalanche dynamics in neural networks, where usually some dynamical order
parameter is fed back onto the network topology by adapting the synaptic
couplings. We here give an overview of existing theoretical models of dynamical
networks. While most models emphasize biological and neurophysiological detail,
our path here is different: we pick up the thread of an early self-organized
critical neural network model by Bornholdt and Roehl (2001) and test its
applicability in the light of experimental data. Keeping the simplicity of
early models, and at the same time lifting the drawback of a spin formulation
with respect to the biological system, we here study an improved model
(Rybarsch and Bornholdt, 2012b) and show that it adapts to criticality
exhibiting avalanche statistics that compare well with experimental data
without the need for parameter tuning.

this descriptive power is given by the categorical analysis of the practice of
""classes as shorthands"" in ZF set theory. In this case category theory provides
a natural way to describe the relation between mathematics and metamathematics:
if metamathematics can be described by using categories (in particular
syntactic categories), then the mathematical level is represented by internal
categories. Through this two-level interpretation we can clarify the relation
between classes and sets in ZF and, in particular, we can present two
equivalent categorical notions of definable set. Some common sayings about set
theory will be interpreted in the light of this representation, emphasizing the
distinction between naive and rigorous sentences about sets and classes.

numerical truncation as a spatial discretization of the system. Some previous
works on well chosen examples show that the dynamical behaviours of dynamical
systems and of their discretizations can be quite different. In this paper we
are interested in generic homeomorphisms of compact manifolds. So our aim is to
tackle the following question: can the dynamical properties of a generic
homeomorphism be detected on the spatial discretizations of this homeomorphism?
We study both conservative and dissipative homeomorphisms (i.e. with or without
the assumption that the homeomorphism preserves a given measure). We will prove
that the dynamics of a single discretization of a generic conservative
homeomorphism does not depend on the homeomorphism itself, but rather on the
grid used for the discretization. Therefore, dynamical properties of a given
generic conservative homeomorphism cannot be detected using a single
discretization. Nevertheless, we will also prove that some dynamical features
of a generic conservative homeomorphism (such as the set of the periods of all
periodic points) can be read on a sequence of finer and finer discretizations.
The dissipative case is somehow opposite: we will see that the dynamics of a
generic dissipative homeomorphism is well-approximated by the dynamics of any
fine enough discretization of this homeomorphism.

This reduces the transfer of kinetic to internal energy of the central hot

smoothing planar and surface meshes, which is developed from the non-iterative
smoothing method originated by Balendran [1]. When smooth planar meshes, the
performance of the MDM is effectively identical to that of Laplacian smoothing,
for triangular and quadrilateral meshes; however, the MDM outperforms Laplacian
smoothing for tri-quad meshes. When smooth surface meshes, for trian-gular,
quadrilateral and quad-dominant mixed meshes, the mean quality(MQ) of all mesh
elements always increases and the mean square error (MSE) decreases during
smoothing; For tri-dominant mixed mesh, the quality of triangles always
descends while that of quads ascends. Test examples show that the MDM is
convergent for both planar and surface triangular, quadrilateral and tri-quad

Stars (INSs), phenomenologically very diverse, e.g. the Myr old X-ray Dim INS

diverse, the similar periods (P=2--10 s) and magnetic fields (~10^{14} G)
suggest that XDINSs are evolved magnetars, possibly born from similar
populations of supermassive stars. One way to test this hypothesis is to
identify their parental star clusters by extrapolating backward the neutron
star velocity vector in the Galactic potential. By using the information on the
age and space velocity of the XDINS RX J1856.5-3754, we computed backwards its
orbit in the Galactic potential and searched for its parental stellar cluster
by means of a closest approach criterion. We found a very likely association
with the Upper Scorpius OB association, for a neutron star age of 0.42+/-0.08
Myr, a radial velocity V_r^NS =67+/- 13$ km s^{-1}, and a present-time
parallactic distance d_\pi^NS = 123^{+11}_{-15} pc. Our result confirms that
the ""true"" neutron star age is much lower than the spin-down age (tau_{sd}=3.8
Myrs), and is in good agreement with the cooling age, as computed within
standard cooling scenarios. The mismatch between the spin-down and the
dynamical/cooling age would require either an anomalously large breaking index
(n~20) or a decaying magnetic field with initial value B_0 ~ 10^{14} G.
Unfortunately, owing to the uncertainty on the age of the Upper Scorpius OB
association and the masses of its members we cannot yet draw firm conclusions
on the estimated mass of the RX J1856.5-3754 progenitor.

striking property that the conduction of electrons occurs only on its surface,
not within the bulk, and that conduction is topologically protected.
Topological protection, the total lack of scattering of electron waves by
disorder, is perhaps the most fascinating and technologically important aspect
of this material: it provides robustness that is otherwise known only for
superconductors. However, unlike superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect,
which necessitate low temperatures or magnetic fields, the immunity to disorder
of topological insulators occurs at room temperature and without any external
magnetic field. For this reason, topological protection is predicted to have
wide-ranging applications in fault-tolerant quantum computing and spintronics.
Recently, a large theoretical effort has been directed towards bringing the
concept into the domain of photonics: achieving topological protection of light
at optical frequencies. Besides the interesting new physics involved, photonic
topological insulators hold the promise for applications in optical isolation
and robust photon transport. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally
demonstrate the first photonic topological insulator: a photonic lattice
exhibiting topologically protected transport on the lattice edges, without the
need for any external field. The system is composed of an array of helical
waveguides, evanescently coupled to one another, and arranged in a
graphene-like honeycomb lattice. The chirality of the waveguides results in
scatter-free, one-way edge states that are topologically protected from
scattering.

widespread cloud changes may be induced by the CR flux. If confirmed, this
would have significant implications for our understanding of natural climate
forcings. Here, we perform a detailed investigation of the relationships
between DTR and solar activity (total solar irradiance and the CR flux) from
more than 60 years of NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data and observations from
meteorological station data. We find no statistically significant evidence to
suggest that the DTR is connected to either long-term solar periodicities (11
or 1.68 year) or short-term (daily-timescale) fluctuations in solar activity,
and we attribute previous reports on the contrary to an incorrect estimation of
the statistical significance of the data. If a CR-DTR relationship exists,
based on the estimated noise in DTR composites during Forbush decrease (FD)
events, the DTR response would need to be larger than 0.03{\deg}C per 1%
increase in the CR flux to be reliably detected. Compared with a much smaller
rough estimate of -0.005{\deg}C per 1% increase in the CR flux expected if
previous claims that FD events cause reductions in the cloud cover are valid,
we conclude it is not possible to detect a solar related responses in
station-based or reanalysis-based DTR datasets related to a hypothesized
CR-cloud link, as potential signals would be drowned in noise.

we are concerned with extended Huffman coding technique that provides the
shortest length of codewords for blocks of two or more symbols. For the
proposed quantizer with extended Huffman coding the convergence of the average

Hamiltonian three-wave equation. A cluster consists of N modes forming a total
of M connected triads. We investigate the problem of constructing a
functionally independent set of quadratic constants of motion. We show that
this problem is equivalent to an underlying basic linear problem, consisting of
finding the null space of a rectangular (M times N) matrix A with entries 1, -1
and 0. In particular, we prove that the number of independent quadratic
invariants is equal to J = N - M* (greater than or equal to N - M), where M* is
the number of linearly independent rows in A. Thus, the problem of finding all
independent quadratic invariants is reduced to a linear algebra problem in the
Hamiltonian case. We establish that the properties of the quadratic invariants
(e.g., locality) are related to the topological properties of the clusters
(e.g., types of linkage). To do so, we formulate an algorithm for decomposing
large clusters into smaller ones and show how various invariants are related to
certain parts of a cluster, including the basic structures leading to M* < M.
We illustrate our findings by presenting examples from the
Charney-Hasegawa-Mima wave model, and by showing a classification of small (up

consider a modified water-filling policy for the power allocation that allows
each macrocell user (MUE) to focus the transmissions on the degrees of freedom
over which the MUE experiences the best channel and interference conditions.
This approach not only represents an effective way to decrease the received
interference at the MUEs but also grants the SBSs tier additional transmission
opportunities and allows for a more agile interference management. Simulation
results show that the proposed approach yields significant gains at both
macrocell and small cell tiers, in terms of average achievable rate per user,
reaching up to 37%, relative to the non-cooperative case, for a network with
150 MUEs and 200 SBSs.

and the coherent dynamics of its superposition states under control of
electromagnetic fields. It is commonly employed to visualise a broad variety of
phenomena ranging from spin ensembles and atoms to quantum dots and
superconducting circuits. The underlying Bloch equations describe the state
evolution of the two-level system and allow characterising both energy and
phase relaxation processes in a simple yet powerful manner.
  Here we demonstrate the realisation of a nanomechanical two-level system
which is driven by radio frequency signals. It allows to extend the above Bloch
sphere formalism to nanoelectromechanical systems. Our realisation is based on
the two orthogonal fundamental flexural modes of a high quality factor
nanostring resonator which are strongly coupled by a dielectric gradient field.
Full Bloch sphere control is demonstrated via Rabi, Ramsey and Hahn echo
experiments. This allows manipulating the classical superposition state of the
coupled modes in amplitude and phase and enables deep insight into the
decoherence mechanisms of nanomechanical systems. We have determined the energy
relaxation time T1 and phase relaxation times T2 and T2*, and find them all to
be equal. This not only indicates that energy relaxation is the dominating
source of decoherence, but also demonstrates that reversible dephasing
processes are negligible in such collective mechanical modes. We thus conclude
that not only T1 but also T2 can be increased by engineering larger mechanical
quality factors. After a series of ground-breaking experiments on ground state
cooling and non-classical signatures of nanomechanical resonators in recent
years, this is of particular interest in the context of quantum information
processing.

The former are based on the concept of local exponential divergence. The latter

orbit, e.g. its frequency. In spite of having totally different conceptual
bases, they are used for the very same goals such as, for instance, separating
the chaotic and the regular component. In fact, we show herein that the
variational indicators serve to distinguish both components of a Hamiltonian
system in a more reliable fashion than a spectral analysis method does. We
study two start spaces for different energy levels of a self-consistent
triaxial stellar dynamical model by means of some selected variational
indicators and a spectral analysis method. In order to select the appropriate
tools for this paper, we extend previous studies where we make a comparison of
several variational indicators on different scenarios. Herein, we compare the
Average Power Law Exponent (APLE) and an alternative quantity given by the Mean
Exponential Growth factor of Neary Orbits (MEGNO): the MEGNO's Slope Estimation
of the largest Lyapunov Characteristic Exponent (SElLCE). The spectral analysis
method selected for the investigation is the Frequency Modified Fourier

Indicator (FLI), the Orthogonal Fast Lyapunov Indicator (OFLI) and the
MEGNO/SElLCE, we show that the SElLCE could be an appropriate alternative to
the MEGNO when studying large samples of initial conditions. The SElLCE
separates the chaotic and the regular components reliably and identifies the
different levels of chaoticity. We show that the FMFT is not as reliable as the
SElLCE to describe clearly the chaotic domains in the experiments.

for understanding the galactic chemical evolution. This study tests atomic data
used in stellar magnesium abundance analyses. We evaluate non-local
thermodynamical equilibrium (NLTE) line formation for Mg I using the most
up-to-date theoretical and experimental atomic data available so far and check
the Mg abundances from individual lines in the Sun, four well studied A-type
stars, and three reference metal-poor stars. With the adopted gf-values, NLTE
abundances derived from the Mg I 4703 A, 5528 A, and Mg Ib lines are consistent
within 0.05 dex for each A-type star. The same four Mg I lines in the solar
spectrum give consistent NLTE abundances at $\log N_{\rm Mg}/N_{\rm H} =
-4.45$, when correcting the van der Waals damping constants inferred from the
perturbation theory. Inelastic Mg+H collisions as treated by Barklem, Belyaev,
Spielfiedel, Guitou, and Feautrier serve as efficient thermalizing process for
the statistical equilibrium of Mg I in the atmospheres of metal-poor stars. The
use of the Mg+H collision data improves Mg abundance determinations for HD
84937 and HD 122563, though does not remove completely the differences between
different lines.

strategies for constraining the galaxy power spectrum and a set of cosmological

to observe a larger, but sparsely sampled, area of sky instead of a smaller
contiguous area. In this work, by making use of the principles of Bayesian
Experimental Design, we will investigate the advantages and disadvantages of
the sparse sampling of the sky and discuss the circumstances in which a sparse
survey is indeed the most efficient strategy. For the Dark Energy Survey (DES),
we find that by sparsely observing the same area in a smaller amount of time,
we only increase the errors on the parameters by a maximum of 0.45%.
Conversely, investing the same amount of time as the original DES to observe a
sparser but larger area of sky we can in fact constrain the parameters with

containing a zero-point energy, and a rotational mode without the zero-point
energy, but having a conserved angular momentum. On the basis of the analysis
of properties of models of rigid and semirigid rotators, the theory of soft
rotators is formulated where the harmonic attractive force is balanced only by
the centrifugal force. As examples a Coulomb rotator (the Bohr model) and a
magneto-harmonic rotator (the Fock-Landau levels) are considered. Disappearance
of the radial speed in the model of a magneto-harmonic rotator is taken as a
defining property of a pure rotational motion in the harmonic potential. After
the exception of energies of the magnetic and spin decompositions, specific to
magnetic fields, one turns to a simple and general model of a planar harmonic
rotator (circular oscillator without radial speed) where kinetic energy is
reduced to the purely rotational energy. Energy levels of the harmonic rotator
have the same frequency and are twice degenerate, the energy spectrum is
equidistant. In the ground state there is no zero-point energy from rotational
modes, and the zero-point energy of vibrational modes can be compensated by
spin effects or symmetries of the system. In this case the operators of
observables vanish the ground state, i.e. are ""strongly"" normally ordered. In a
chain of harmonic rotators collective rotations around a common axis lead to
transverse waves, at quantization of which there appear quasi-particles and
holes carrying an angular momentum. In the chain SU(2) appears as a group of
symmetry of a rotator.
