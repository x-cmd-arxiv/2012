proteins above threshold concentrations within a time interval are affected by
stochastic fluctuations in biochemical reactions? We address this question
using minimal models of stochastic chemical reactions commonly found in cell
signaling and gene regulatory systems. Employing exact solutions and
semi-analytical methods we calculate distributions of the maximum value ($N$)
of activated species concentrations ($P_{max}(N)$) and the time ($t$) taken to
reach the maximum value ($P_{max}(t)$) within a time window in the minimal
models. We find, the presence of positive feedback interactions make
$P_{max}(N)$ more spread out with a higher ""peakedness"" in $P_{max}(t)$. Thus
positive feedback interactions may help single cells to respond sensitively to
a stimulus when cell decision processes require upregulation of activated forms
of key proteins to a threshold number within a time window.

perfect fluid as a matter source. We show that the brane universe evolves from

The secular time derivative of Tisserand parameter is analytically derived for

parameter a general relation between the secular time derivatives of
eccentricity and inclination is obtained. In the planar case (the case when the
initial dust particle position vector, initial dust particle velocity vector
and interstellar gas velocity vector lie in the planet orbital plane) is
possible to calculate directly the secular time derivative of eccentricity.
  Using numerical integration of equation of motion we confirmed our analytical
results in the three-dimensional case and also in the planar case. Evolutions
of eccentricity of the dust particle captured in an exterior mean motion
resonance under the action of the Poynting-Robertson effect, radial stellar

  Qualitative properties of the orbital evolution in the planar case are
determined. Two main groups of the secular orbital evolutions exist. In the
first group the eccentricity and argument of perihelion approach to some
values. In the second group the eccentricity oscillates and argument of
perihelion rapidly shifts.

introduced the technique of subspace enumeration, which gives approximation
algorithms for graph problems such as unique games and small set expansion; the
running time of such algorithms is exponential in the threshold-rank of the
graph.
  Guruswami and Sinop [GS11,GS12], and Barak, Raghavendra, and Steurer [BRS11]
developed an alternative approach to the design of approximation algorithms for
graphs of bounded threshold-rank, based on semidefinite programming relaxations
in the Lassere hierarchy and on novel rounding techniques. These algorithms are
faster than the ones based on subspace enumeration and work on a broad class of
problems.
  In this paper we develop a third approach to the design of such algorithms.
We show, constructively, that graphs of bounded threshold-rank satisfy a weak
Szemeredi regularity lemma analogous to the one proved by Frieze and Kannan
[FK99] for dense graphs. The existence of efficient approximation algorithms is
then a consequence of the regularity lemma, as shown by Frieze and Kannan.
Applying our method to the Max Cut problem, we devise an algorithm that is
faster than all previous algorithms, and is easier to describe and analyze.

shown that the property of closure of coset groups can be used to generate the

follow directly from group closure instead of being postulated. In this
approach, constraints on multiplication parameters can be formulated in ways
that capture the symmetry features of the coset group. A complete
classification of numbers systems is therefore obtained based on possible group
structures of a given order. General matrix representations are also obtained
through the coset procedure and by construction, the form of these matrices is
invariant under matrix addition and multiplication. Since group symmetries are
captured naturally into each number system, the coset group approach can add

canonical form) for a class of non-symmetric Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operators with
the drift coefficient matrix being a Jordan block and the diffusion coefficient
matrix being identity multiplying a constant. For the 2-dimensional case, we
present all the general eigenfunctions by the induction. For the 3-dimensional
case, we divide the calculating of the Jordan decomposition into several steps
(the key step is to do the canonical projection onto the homogeneous Hermite
polynomials, next we use the theory of systems of linear equations). As a
by-pass product, we get the geometric multiplicity of the eigenvalue of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator.

problems, such as microscopic studies of equilibrium and transport properties

the (in)efficiency of the algorithm matters particularly in hybrid
hydrodynamics + hadronic transport calculations. With popular software
packages, such as UrQMD 3.3p1 or THERMINATOR, it can still take ten hours to
generate particles for a single Pb+Pb ""event"" at the LHC from fluid dynamics
output. Below I describe reasonably efficient simple algorithms using the MPC
package, which should help speed momentum generation up by at least one order
of magnitude.
  It is likely that this wheel has been reinvented many times instead of reuse,
so there may very well exist older and/or better algorithms that I am not aware
of (MPC has been around only since 2000). The main goal here is to encourage
practitioners to use available efficient routines, and offer a few practical

drawback, namely, the tachyonic slepton problem, and needs to be extended. The
so-called (positively) deflected AMSB is a simple extension to solve the
problem and also provides us with the usual neutralino lightest superpartner as
a good candidate for dark matter in the Universe. Motivated by the recent
discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments, we
perform the parameter scan in the deflected AMSB scenario by taking into
account a variety of phenomenological constraints such as the dark matter relic
density and the observed Higgs boson mass around 125-126 GeV. We identify the
allowed parameter region and list benchmark mass spectra. We find that in most
of the allowed parameter regions, the dark matter neutralino is Higgsino-like
and its elastic scattering cross section with nuclei is within the future reach
of the direct dark matter search experiments, while (colored) sparticles are
quite heavy and their discovery at the LHC is challenging.

crosses over to a fast translocation regime as the frequency of the driving
force decreases. In the attractive pore case, because of a free energy well
induced inside the pore, the translocation time can be a minimum at the optimal
frequency of the force, the so-called resonant activation. In the latter case,
we examine the effect of various physical parameters on the resonant
activation, and explain our observations using simple theoretical arguments.

similarity dimension, then at small scales there are super-exponentially close
cylinders. This is a step towards the folklore conjecture that such a drop in
dimension is explained only by exact overlaps, and confirms the conjecture in
cases where the contraction parameters are algebraic. It also gives an
affirmative answer to a conjecture of Furstenberg, showing that the projections
of the ""1-dimensional Sierpinski gasket"" in irrational directions are all of
dimension 1.
  As another consequence, if a family of self-similar sets or measures is
parametrized in a real-analytic manner, then, under an extremely mild
non-degeneracy condition, the set of ""exceptional"" parameters has Hausdorff
dimension 0. Thus, for example, there is at most a zero-dimensional set of
parameters 1/2<r<1 such that the corresponding Bernoulli convolution has
dimension <1, and similarly for Sinai's problem on iterated function systems

restricted to random element of a partition D_i, 0<i<n, either mu is close to

dynamics with inverse noise beta describes the behavior of a complex system
whose individual components act selfishly and keep responding according to some
partial (""noisy"") knowledge of the system, where the capacity of the agent to
know the system and compute her best move is measured by the inverse of the
parameter beta.
  In particular, we prove nearly tight bounds for potential games and games
with dominant strategies. Our results show that, for potential games, the
mixing time is upper and lower bounded by an exponential in the inverse of the
noise and in the maximum potential difference. Instead, for games with dominant
strategies, the mixing time cannot grow arbitrarily with the inverse of the

  Finally, we refine our analysis for a subclass of potential games called
graphical coordination games, a class of games that have been previously
studied in Physics and, more recently, in Computer Science in the context of
diffusion of new technologies. We give evidence that the mixing time of the

  interactions","37 pages",,,,"cond-mat.quant-gas quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe recent development of quantum hydrodynamics for ultracold Bose
particle studying and consider different kinds of interactions. The method of
derivation of equations describing the evolution of the neutral Bose particle
system at low temperatures is described. Despite the fact that we consider the
neutral particles we account the short-range interaction between particles. We
consider the particles in the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) state. This method
is called the method of quantum hydrodynamics, because natural for of the
quantum mechanics rewritten in terms of material fields of observable
quantities in three dimensional space is the set of equations, which look like
the hydrodynamics equations. It can be shown that from the quantum
hydrodynamics equations can be derived macroscopic non-linear Schrodinger
equation. Most famous non-linear Schrodinger equation is the Gross-Pitaevskii
(GP) equation, which contains nonlinearity of the third degree. There are
generalizations of the GP equation. New term appears in the GP equation at
account of the three-particle interaction. This term contains nonlinearity of
the fifth degree. At more detailed account of the two particle interaction we
come to the nonlocal non-linear Schrodinger equation. This equation contains
spatial derivatives of the order parameter in the non-linear terms caused by
the interaction. In this terminology the GP equation corresponds to the first
order by the interaction radius. For the BEC of the neutral particles with
anisotropic long-range dipole-dipole interaction the generalization of the GP
equation was also suggested. Detailed analyses of the applicability conditions
shows that this equation valid for the system of dipoles parallel to each
other, which do not change their direction, and where the dipole-dipole
interaction interferences translational motion of particles.

of proving ""weak"" circuit lower bounds such as ${\sf NEXP} \not\subset {\sf
TC^0}$. Natural Proofs have three properties: they are constructive (an
efficient algorithm $A$ is embedded in them), have largeness ($A$ accepts a
large fraction of strings), and are useful ($A$ rejects all strings which are
truth tables of small circuits). Strong circuit lower bounds that are
""naturalizing"" would contradict present cryptographic understanding, yet the
vast majority of known circuit lower bound proofs are naturalizing. So it is
imperative to understand how to pursue un-Natural Proofs. Some heuristic
arguments say constructivity should be circumventable: largeness is inherent in
many proof techniques, and it is probably our presently weak techniques that
yield constructivity. We prove:
  $\bullet$ Constructivity is unavoidable, even for $\sf NEXP$ lower bounds.
Informally, we prove for all ""typical"" non-uniform circuit classes ${\cal C}$,
${\sf NEXP} \not\subset {\cal C}$ if and only if there is a polynomial-time
algorithm distinguishing some function from all functions computable by ${\cal
C}$-circuits. Hence ${\sf NEXP} \not\subset {\cal C}$ is equivalent to
exhibiting a constructive property useful against ${\cal C}$.
  $\bullet$ There are no $\sf P$-natural properties useful against ${\cal C}$
if and only if randomized exponential time can be ""derandomized"" using truth
tables of circuits from ${\cal C}$ as random seeds. Therefore the task of
proving there are no $\sf P$-natural properties is inherently a derandomization
problem, weaker than but implied by the existence of strong pseudorandom
functions.
  These characterizations are applied to yield several new results, including
improved ${\sf ACC}^0$ lower bounds and new unconditional derandomizations.

of signal propagation in a long line changes. We found the analytical solution
describing the form of the transformed signal for a line with losses, when line
parameters change symmetrically. We also considered lines without losses, with
asymmetrical change of parameters. Our theoretical results comply with
experimental data. In certain conditions, such a line can be used as an
amplifier. The parametric effect in optics is described by Maxwell's equations,
while in case of a long line, the analysis is based on telegrapher's equations.
However, it turns out that in the end, both in optics and electronics, the
parametric effect is described by wave equations that are mathematically
similar. This is because fundamentally, the parametric effect is physically
based on energy interchange between the controlling (pump) signal and the
transformed one, when the parameters of the propagating medium change. So, the
obtained results can be used for analysis of parametric effects in optics and
electronics.

level using extended-on-mass-shell subtraction scheme within the framework of
covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory. Numerical fits to partial wave
phase shift data up to $\sqrt{s}=1.13$ GeV are performed to pin down the free
low energy constants. A good description to the existing phase shift data is
achieved. We find a good convergence for the chiral series at $O(p^4)$,
considerably improved with respect to the $O(p^3)$-level analyses found in
previous literature. Also, the leading order contribution from explicit
$\Delta(1232)$ resonance and partially-included $\Delta(1232)$ loop
contribution are included to describe phase shift data up to $\sqrt{s}=1.20$
GeV. As phenomenological applications, we investigate chiral correction to the
Goldberger-Treiman relation %$\Delta_{GT}$ and find that it converges rapidly,
and the $O(p^3)$ correction is found to be very small: $\simeq 0.2%$. We also
get a reasonable prediction of pion-nucleon sigma term $\sigma_{\pi N}$ up to
$O(p^4)$ by performing fits including both the pion-nucleon partial wave phase
shift data and the lattice QCD data. We report that $\sigma_{\pi N}=52\pm7$ MeV
from the fit without $\Delta(1232)$, and $\sigma_{\pi N}=45\pm6$ MeV from the
fit with explicit $\Delta(1232)$.

Coble quartic was recently determined completely by Q.Ran, S.Sam, G.Schrader,
and B.Sturmfels, who computed it completely explicitly, as a polynomial with
372060 monomials of bidegree (28,4) in theta constants of the second order and
theta functions of the second order, respectively. Our expression is in terms
of products of theta constants with characteristics corresponding to Gopel
systems, and is a polynomial with 134 terms.
  Our approach is based on the beautiful geometry studied by Coble and further
investigated by Dolgachev and Ortland, and highlights the geometry and
combinatorics of syzygetic octets of characteristics, and the corresponding
representations of the symplectic group. One new ingredient is the relationship
of Gopel systems and Jacobian determinants of theta functions.
  In genus 2, we similarly obtain a short explicit equation for the universal
Kummer surface, and relate modular forms of level two to binary invariants of
six points on P^1.

addressed, aiming at elucidating the potential of this collagen system as
mineralization template. Functionalised collagen hydrogels demonstrated a
preserved triple helix conformation. Decreased swelling ratio and increased
thermo-mechanical properties were observed in comparison to state-of-the-art
carbodiimide (EDC)-crosslinked collagen controls. Ph-crosslinked samples
displayed no optical damage and only a slight mass decrease (~ 4 wt.-%)
following 1-week incubation in simulated body fluid (SBF), while nearly 50
wt.-% degradation was observed in EDC-crosslinked collagen. SEM/EDS revealed
amorphous mineral deposition, whereby increased calcium phosphate ratio was
suggested in hydrogels with increased Ph content. This investigation provides
valuable insights for the synthesis of triple helical collagen materials with
enhanced macroscopic properties and controlled degradation. In light of these
features, this system will be applied for the design of tissue-like scaffolds
for mineralized tissue formation.
