revealed two types of coevolving units: coevolving contacts, which are pairs of
amino acids distant along the sequence but in contact in the three-dimensional
structure, and sectors, which are larger groups of structurally connected amino
acids that underlie the biochemical properties of proteins. By reconciling two
approaches for analyzing correlations in multiple sequence alignments, we link
these two findings together and with coevolving units of intermediate size,
called `sectons', which are shown to provide additional information. By
extending the analysis to the co-occurrence of orthologous genes in bacterial
genomes, we also show that the methods and results are general and relevant
beyond protein structures.

4.4% of all galaxies more massive than 3 X 10^{10} M_sun in the field. Such

are early-type galaxies with intermediate to old stellar populations. There is
a trend of smaller radii for older luminosity-weighted ages at fixed galaxy

galaxies of different stellar masses and in different environments. We compare
with high-z data to quantify the evolution of galaxy sizes. We find that, once
the progenitor bias due to the relation between galaxy size and stellar age is

SM4, the simplest four generation extension of the SM, is inconsistent with the
most recent LHC data. However, 4G variations (BSM4) are possible if the new
particle is not the SM Higgs boson and/or if other new quanta modify its
production and decay rates. Since LHC searches have pushed 4G quarks to high
mass and strong coupling where perturbation theory eventually fails, we examine
the leading nondecoupling EW (electroweak) corrections at two loop order to
estimate the domain of validity for perturbation theory. We find that the two
loop hypercharge correction, which has not been included in previous EW fits of
4G models, makes the largest quark sector contribution to the rho parameter,
much larger even than the nominally leading one loop term. Because it is large
and negative, it has a big effect on the EW fits. It does not invalidate
perturbation theory since it only first appears at two loop order and is large
because it does not vanish for equal quark doublet masses, unlike the one loop
term. We estimate that perturbation theory is useful for $m_Q\simeq 600$ GeV
but begins to become marginal for $m_Q\, \gtap\, 900$ GeV. The results apply
directly to BSM4 models that retain the SM Higgs sector but must be
re-evaluated for non-SM Higgs sectors.

single InAs/GaAs quantum dots in a planar microcavity. Due to the presence of
at least one residual charge in the quantum dots, the resonant excitation of
the neutral exciton is blocked. The influence of the residual doping on the
initial quantum dots charge state is analyzed, and the resonant emission
quenching is interpreted as a Coulomb blockade effect. The use of an additional
non-resonant laser in a specific low power regime leads to the carrier draining
in quantum dots and allows an efficient optical gating of the exciton resonant
emission. A detailed population evolution model, developed to describe the
carrier draining and the optical gate effect, perfectly fits the experimental
results in the steady state and dynamical regimes of the optical gate with a
single set of parameters. We deduce that ultra-slow Auger- and phonon-assisted
capture processes govern the carrier draining in quantum dots with relaxation
times in the 1 - 100 microsecond range. We conclude that the optical gate acts
as a very sensitive probe of the quantum dots population relaxation in an
unprecedented slow-capture regime.

the difficulty to achieve a clear biological interpretation. For that purpose
in the last years there has been a growing interest in approaches that try to

a novel algorithm, called FrSVM, which integrates protein-protein interaction

large differences in their expression. Compared to several other competing
methods our algorithm reveals a significantly better prediction performance and
higher signature stability. More- over, obtained gene lists are highly enriched

integrating information on candidate disease genes and targets of disease

convergence, coincide with the principle reaction pathway. We demonstrate the
application of this method to several simple, two-dimensional models of driven
Brownian motion and to the conformational change of the nitrogen regulatory

challenge for all theoretical explanations since the detection of powerful,
persistent GeV emission from LS 5039 and LS I +61 303 by Fermi/LAT. The
spectral cutoff at a few GeV indicates that the GeV component and the fainter,
hard TeV emission above 100 GeV are not directly related. We explore the
possible origins of these two emission components in the framework of a young,
non-accreting pulsar orbiting the massive star, and initiating the non-thermal
emission through the interaction of the stellar and pulsar winds. The
pulsar/stellar wind interaction in a compact orbit binary gives rise to two
potential locations for particle acceleration: the shocks at the head-on
collision of the winds and the termination shock caused by Coriolis forces on
scales larger than the binary separation. We explore the suitability of these
two locations to host the GeV and TeV emitters, respectively, through the study
of their non-thermal emission along the orbit. We focus on the application of
this model to LS 5039 given its well determined stellar wind with respect to
other gamma-ray binaries. The application of the proposed model to LS 5039
indicates that these two potential emitter locations provide the necessary
conditions for reproduction of the two-component high-energy gamma-ray spectrum
of LS 5039. In addition, the ambient postshock conditions required at each of
the locations are consistent with recent hydrodynamical simulations. The
scenario based on the interaction of the stellar and pulsar winds is compatible

(LRGs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7) catalogue within an
interval $0.16 \leq z \leq 0.47$ is carried out. We found that the radial
distribution of $\sim$ 106,000 LRGs incorporates a few quasi-periodical
components relatively to a variable $\eta$, dimensionless line-of-sight
comoving distance calculated for the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. The most
significant peaks of the power spectra are obtained for two close periodicities
corresponding to the spatial comoving scales $(135 \pm 12) h^{-1}$ Mpc and
$(101 \pm 6)h^{-1}$ Mpc. The latter one is dominant and consistent with the
characteristic scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations. We analyse also the
radial distributions of two other selected LRG samples: $\sim$ 33,400 bright
LRGs ($-23.2 < M \leq -21.8$) and $\sim$ 60,300 all LRGs within a rectangle
region on the sky, and show differences of the quasi-periodical features
characteristic for different samples. Being confirmed the results would allow
to give preference of the spatial against temporal models which could explain
the quasi-periodicities discussed here. As a caveat we show that estimations of
the significance levels of the peaks strongly depend on a smoothed radial
function (trend) as well as characteristics of random fluctuations.

deal with two exact constraints of exchange-correlation (XC)

discontinuities at integers. By means of one-dimensional (1D) discrete Hubbard

pure states of measured systems) from unitarity (which does not, however, allow
for a literal collapse) and from the repeatability of measurements: Continuous
unitary evolution and repeatability suffice to establish the discreteness that
underlies quantum jumps. Here we consider mixed states of a macroscopic, open

when, e.g., measured by an observer, provided that its salient features remain
unchanged and that observers regard macroscopic state of the pointer as
representing the same record. We conclude that repeatably accessible states of
macroscopic systems (such as the states of the apparatus pointer) must
correspond to orthogonal subspaces in the Hilbert space. The symmetry breaking
we exhibit defies the egalitarian quantum superposition principle and unitary
symmetry of the Hilbert space, as it singles out preferred subspaces. We
conclude that the resulting discreteness (which underlies quantum jumps)
emerges from the continuity of the core quantum postulates plus repeatability
also in macroscopic and open, but ultimately quantum systems such as measuring
devices accessed by observers, where (in contrast with pure states of
microsystems) repeatability is paramount.

amplification (MFA) by cosmic-ray (CR) streaming instabilities and Alfv'enic
drift, we perform kinetic DSA simulations for a wide range of sonic and
Alfv'enic Mach numbers and evaluate the CR injection fraction and acceleration
efficiency. In our DSA model the CR acceleration efficiency is determined
mainly by the sonic Mach number Ms, while the MFA factor depends on the
Alfv'enic Mach number and the degree of shock modification by CRs. We show that
at strong CR modified shocks, if scattering centers drift with an effective
Alfv'en speed in the amplified magnetic field, the CR energy spectrum is
steepened and the acceleration efficiency is reduced significantly, compared to
the cases without such effects. As a result, the postshock CR pressure
saturates roughly at ~ 20 % of the shock ram pressure for strong shocks with
Ms>~ 10. In the test-particle regime (Ms<~ 3), it is expected that the magnetic
field is not amplified and the Alfv'enic drift effects are insignificant,

finite alphabet, also carries a data value from an infinite domain. They have
been used as an abstraction model for reasoning tasks on {XML} and
verification. However, most existing approaches consider the case where only
equality test can be performed on the data values.
  In this paper we study data trees in which the data values come from a
linearly ordered domain, and in addition to equality test, we can test whether
the data value in a node is greater than the one in another node. We introduce
an automata model for them which we call ordered-data tree automata (ODTA),
provide its logical characterisation, and prove that its non-emptiness problem
is decidable in 3-NEXPTIME. We also show that the two-variable logic on
unranked trees, studied by Bojanczyk, Muscholl, Schwentick and Segoufin in
2009, corresponds precisely to a special subclass of this automata model.
  Then we define a slightly weaker version of ODTA, which we call weak ODTA,
and provide its logical characterisation. The complexity of the non-emptiness
problem drops to NP. However, a number of existing formalisms and models
studied in the literature can be captured already by weak ODTA. We also show
that the definition of ODTA can be easily modified, to the case where the data
values come from a tree-like partially ordered domain, such as strings.

poly(styrene) (PS)-silica to large-amplitude oscillatory shear deformations.
Nonlinear behavior of PS nanocomposites is discussed with the changes in
particle dispersion upon deformation to provide a complete physical picture of
their mechanical properties. The elastic stresses for the particle and polymer
are resolved by decomposing the total stress into its purely elastic and
viscous components for composites at different strain levels within a cycle of
deformation. We propose a mechanistic model which captures the deformation of
particles and polymer networks at small and large strains, respectively. We
show, for the first time, that chain stretching in a polymer nanocomposite
obtained in large amplitude oscillatory deformation is in good agreement with
the nonlinear chain deformation theory of polymeric networks.

that end, this paper presents a performance comparison between a pulsed,
computational ghost imager and a pulsed, floodlight-illumination imaging laser
radar. Both are considered for range-resolving (3D) imaging of a collection of
rough-surfaced objects at standoff ranges in the presence of atmospheric

as functions of the system parameters, and these results are used to assess
each system's performance trade-offs. Scenarios in which a reflective
ghost-imaging system has advantages over a laser radar are identified.

differentiating the distinct classes of extremal black hole solutions. When the
U-duality group satisfies certain algebraic conditions, as is the case for a
broad class of supergravities, the extremal black holes enjoy a further
symmetry known as Freudenthal duality (F-duality), which although distinct from
U-duality preserves the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Here it is shown that, by
adopting the doubled Lagrangian formalism, F-duality, defined on the doubled
field strengths, is not only a symmetry of the black hole solutions, but also
of the equations of motion themselves. A further role for F-duality is
introduced in the context of world-sheet actions. The Nambu-Goto world-sheet
action in any (t, s) signature spacetime can be written in terms of the F-dual.
The corresponding field equations and Bianchi identities are then related by
F-duality allowing for an F-dual formulation of Gaillard-Zumino duality on the
world-sheet. An equivalent polynomial ""Polyakov- type"" action is introduced
using the so-called black hole potential. Such a construction allows for
actions invariant under all groups of type E7, including E7 itself, although in
this case the stringy interpretation is less clear.

relations which does not require a trusted (signed) payment descriptor to be
sent from the merchant to the customer. Instead, the destination ""account""
number for the payment is solely created on the customer side. This eliminates
the need for any encrypted or authenticated communication in the protocol and
is secure even if the merchant's online infrastructure is compromised.
Moreover, the payment transaction itself serves as a timestamped receipt for
the customer. It proves what has been paid for and who received the funds,
again without relying on any merchant signatures. In particular, funds and
receipt are exchanged in a single atomic action. The asymmetric nature of the
customer-merchant relation is crucial.
  The protocol is specifically designed with bitcoin in mind as the underlying
payment system. Thereby, it has the useful benefit that all transactions are
public. However, the only essential requirement on the payment system is that
""accounts"" are arbitrary user-created keypairs of a cryptosystem whose keypairs
enjoy a homomorphic property. All ElGamal-type cryptosystems have this feature.
For use with bitcoin we propose the design of a deterministic bitcoin wallet

classical stopping rule like Morozov's discrepancy principle, Pearson's test

of image reconstruction from data recorded by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy

consisting of structures analogous to those of a real solar flare we validate
the fidelity and accuracy with which the proposed stopping rule recovers the

classical stopping rules and its advantages are shown in the case of real data

space-times and special attention is given to the particular values of the
scaling exponents appearing in certain non-Fermi liquids. We study linearized
perturbations in this model, and consider probe fields whose interactions mimic

fields are invariant under the Lifshitz scaling. We derive
Breitenlohner-Freedman-type bounds for these new probe fields. For the cases of
interest the hvLif space-times have curvature invariants that blow up in the

identified econometric models. While the existing literature on Bayesian
partial identification has mostly focused on the structural parameter, our
primary focus is on Bayesian credible sets (BCS's) of the unknown identified
set and the posterior distribution of its support function. We construct a
(two-sided) BCS based on the support function of the identified set. We prove
the Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the posterior distribution of the support
function. This powerful result in turn infers that, while the BCS and the
frequentist confidence set for the partially identified parameter are
asymptotically different, our constructed BCS for the identified set has an
asymptotically correct frequentist coverage probability. Importantly, we
illustrate that the constructed BCS for the identified set does not require a
prior on the structural parameter. It can be computed efficiently for subset
inference, especially when the target of interest is a sub-vector of the
partially identified parameter, where projecting to a low-dimensional subset is
often required. Hence, the proposed methods are useful in many applications.
  The Bayesian partial identification literature has been assuming a known
parametric likelihood function. However, econometric models usually only
identify a set of moment inequalities, and therefore using an incorrect
likelihood function may result in misleading inferences. In contrast, with a
nonparametric prior on the unknown likelihood function, our proposed Bayesian
procedure only requires a set of moment conditions, and can efficiently make
inference about both the partially identified parameter and its identified set.
This makes it widely applicable in general moment inequality models. Finally,
the proposed method is illustrated in a financial asset pricing problem.

representing a single scene from few linear multi-view measurements. Each
observed image is modeled as the sum of a background image and a foreground
one. The background image is common to all observed images but undergoes
geometric transformations, as the scene is observed from different viewpoints.
In this paper, we assume that these geometric transformations are represented
by a few parameters, e.g., translations, rotations, affine transformations,
etc.. The foreground images differ from one observed image to another, and are
used to model possible occlusions of the scene. The proposed reconstruction
algorithm estimates jointly the images and the transformation parameters from
the available multi-view measurements. The ideal solution of this multi-view
imaging problem minimizes a non-convex functional, and the reconstruction
technique is an alternating descent method built to minimize this functional.
The convergence of the proposed algorithm is studied, and conditions under
which the sequence of estimated images and parameters converges to a critical
point of the non-convex functional are provided. Finally, the efficiency of the
algorithm is demonstrated using numerical simulations for applications such as
compressed sensing or super-resolution.

emissivity to compare the strength of the AME detected in different regions.
Such a value is usually defined as the ratio between the intensity of the AME
at 1 cm and the thermal dust emission at 100 \mu m. However, as studies of
Galactic dust emission have shown, the intensity of the thermal dust emission
at 100 \mu m is strongly dependent on the dust temperature, which has severe
implications for the AME emissivity defined in this way. In this work, we
illustrate and quantify this effect and find that the AME emissivity decreases
by a factor of 11.1 between dust temperatures of 20 and 30 K. We, therefore,
conclude that computing the AME emissivity relative to the 100 \mu m emission
does not allow for accurate comparisons between the AME observed in different
environments. With this in mind, we investigate the use of other tracers of the
dust emission with which to compute the AME emissivity and we ultimately
conclude that, despite the difficulty in deriving its value, the column density
of the dust would be the most suitable quantity with which to compute the AME
emissivity.

their computation gates, as well as the usual input, output and constant (0/1)
gates. As is the norm for Boolean circuits, our circuits have multiple sink
gates, which implies that an OR circuit computes an OR function on some subset
of its input variables. Determining that subset amounts to solving a number of
reachability questions on a polynomial-size directed graph (which input gates
are connected to the output gate?), taken from a very sparse set of graphs.
However, it is not obvious whether or not this (restricted) reachability
problem can be solved, by say, uniform AC^0 circuits (constant depth,
polynomial-size, AND, OR, NOT gates). This is one reason why characterizing the
power of these simple-looking circuits in terms of uniform classes turns out to
be intriguing. Another is that the model itself seems particularly natural and
worthy of study.
  Our goal is the systematic characterization of uniform polynomial-size OR
circuits, and AND circuits, in terms of known uniform machine-based complexity
classes. In particular, we consider the languages reducible to such uniform
families of OR circuits, and AND circuits, under a variety of reduction types.
We give upper and lower bounds on the computational power of these language
classes. We find that these complexity classes are closely related to tallyNL,
the set of unary languages within NL, and to sets reducible to tallyNL.
Specifically, for a variety of types of reductions (many-one, conjunctive truth
table, disjunctive truth table, truth table, Turing) we give characterizations
of languages reducible to OR circuit classes in terms of languages reducible to
tallyNL classes. Then, some of these OR classes are shown to coincide, and some
are proven to be distinct. We give analogous results for AND circuits. Finally,
for many of our OR circuit classes, and analogous AND circuit classes, we prove
whether or not the two classes coincide, although we leave one such inclusion
open.

viz.} (a) large scale flatness, (b) absence of monopoles and strings, and (c)
structure formation, the first two are addressed from the viewpoint of the
observed scales having originated from very small ones, on which the density
fluctuations of the curvaton and relics are {\it inevitably} of order unity or
larger. By analyzing strictly classically (and in two different gauges to
ensure consistency) the density evolution of the smoothest possible
pre-inflationary component -- thermal radiation -- it is found that the O(1)
statistical fluctuations on the thermal wavelength scale present formidable
obstacles to the linear theory of amplitude growth by the end of inflation.
Since this wavelength scale exited the horizon at an early stage of inflation,
it severely limits the number of e-folds of perturbative inflation. With more
e-folds than $\approx 60$ there will be even larger fluctuations in the
radiation density that ensures inflation keeps making `false starts'. The only
`way out' is to invoke a super-homogeneous pre-inflationary fluid, at least on
small scales, adding to the fine-tuning and preventing one from claiming that

planet-forming zones of disks is starting to be explored with Spitzer and
high-resolution ground-based data. However, these studies have focused only on
a few simple molecules. The aim of this study is to put observational
constraints on the presence of more complex organic and sulfur-bearing
molecules predicted to be abundant in chemical models of disks and to simulate
high resolution spectra in view of future missions. High S/N Spitzer spectra at
10-30 micron of the near edge-on disks IRS46 and GVTau are used to search for
mid-infrared absorption bands of various molecules. These disks are good
laboratories because absorption studies do not suffer from low line/continuum
ratios that plague emission data. Simple LTE slab models are used to infer
column densities (or upper limits) and excitation temperatures. Bands of HCN,
C2H2 and CO2 are clearly detected toward both sources. The HCN and C2H2
absorption arises in warm gas with Tex of 400-700 K, whereas the CO2 absorption
originates in cooler gas of app. 250 K (as in Lahuis 2006). No other absorption
features are detected. Limits of those molecules are determined and compared
with disk models. The inferred ratios wrt. C2H2 and HCN are roughly consistent
with models of the chemistry in high-T gas. Models of UV irradiated disk
surfaces generally agree better than pure X-ray models. The limit on NH3/HCN
implies that evaporation of NH3 containing ices is only a minor contributor.
The inferred ratios also compare well with those found in comets, suggesting
that part of the cometary material may derive from warm inner disk gas. High
resolution simulations show that future instruments on JWST, ELTs, SOFIA and
SPICA can probe up to an order of magnitude lower ratios and put important new
constraints on the models, especially if pushed to high S/N ratios.

microscopic understanding of their nature remains an outstanding problem.
Conflicting phenomenological models are used to describe TLSs in seemingly
similar materials when probed with different experimental techniques.
Specifically, bulk measurements in amorphous solids have been interpreted using
the model of a tunneling atom or group of atoms, whereas TLSs observed in the
insulating barriers of Josephson junction qubits have been understood in terms
of tunneling of individual electrons. Motivated by recent experiments studying
TLSs in Josephson junctions, especially the effects of elastic strain on TLS
properties, we analyze interaction of the electronic TLS with phonons. We
demonstrate that strong polaronic effects lead to dramatic changes in TLS
properties. Our model gives a quantitative understanding of the TLS relaxation
and dephasing as probed in Josephson junction qubits, while providing an
alternative interpretation of bulk experiments. We demonstrate that a model of
polaron dressed electronic TLS leads to estimates for the density and
distribution of parameters of TLSs consistent with bulk experiments in
amorphous solids. This model explains such surprising observations of recent
experiments as the existence of minima in the energy of some TLSs as a function
of strain and makes concrete predictions for the character of TLS dephasing
near such minima. We argue that better understanding of the microscopic nature
of TLSs can be used to improve properties of quantum devices, from an
enhancement of relaxation time of TLSs, to creating new types of strongly
interacting optomechanical systems.

  material to appendices to streamline and clarify main text",,,,"quant-ph physics.atom-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrical resonators are widely used in quantum information processing, by
engineering an electromagnetic interaction with qubits based on real or virtual
exchange of microwave photons. This interaction relies on strong coupling
between the qubits' transition dipole moments and the vacuum fluctuations of
the resonator in the same manner as cavity QED, and has consequently come to be
called ""circuit QED"" (cQED). Great strides in the control of quantum
information have already been made experimentally using this idea. However, the
central role played by photon exchange induced by quantum fluctuations in cQED
does result in some characteristic limitations. In this paper, we discuss an
alternative method for coupling qubits electromagnetically via a resonator, in
which no photons are exchanged, and where the resonator need not have strong
quantum fluctuations. Instead, the interaction can be viewed in terms of
classical, effective ""forces"" exerted by the qubits on the resonator, and the
resulting resonator dynamics used to produce qubit entanglement are purely
classical in nature. We show how this type of interaction is similar to that
encountered in the manipulation of atomic ion qubits, and we exploit this
analogy to construct two-qubit entangling operations that are largely
insensitive to thermal or other noise in the resonator, and to its quality
factor. These operations are also extensible to larger numbers of qubits,
allowing interactions to be selectively generated among any desired subset of
those coupled to a single resonator. Our proposal is potentially applicable to
a variety of physical qubit modalities, including superconducting and
semiconducting solid-state qubits, trapped molecular ions, and possibly even
electron spins in solids.

the advantage of easy control of the parameters of the Gaussian profile of its

to the axisymmetric force between 3% and 6%, approximately. Good
self-consistency of arm shapes is obtained between the Inner Lindblad resonance

to deviate from the imposed logarithmic spiral form. This creates bifurcations
that appear as short arms. Therefore the deviation from a perfect logarithmic
spiral in galaxies can be understood as a natural effect of the 4:1 resonance.
Beyond the 4:1 resonance we find closed orbits which have similarities with the
arms observed in our Galaxy. In regions near the center, in the presence of a
massive bulge, elongated stellar orbits appear naturally, without imposing any
bar-shaped potential, but only extending the spiral perturbation a little
inward of the ILR. This suggests that a bar is formed with a half-size around 3
kpc by a mechanism similar to that of the spiral arms. The potential energy
perturbation that we adopted represents an important step in the direction of
self-consistency, compared to previous sine function descriptions of the
potential. Our model produces a realistic description of the spiral structure,
able to explain several details that were not yet understood.

structure of discrete integrable systems from the perspective of
multi-dimensional consistency. In the present work, we follow this line of
research and develop a Lagrangian theory of integrable one-dimensional systems.
We give a complete solution of the following problem: one looks for a function
of several variables (interpreted as multi-time) which delivers critical points
to the action functionals obtained by integrating a Lagrangian 1-form along any
smooth curve in the multi-time. The Lagrangian 1-form is supposed to depend on
the first jet of the sought-after function. We derive the corresponding
multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and show that, under the multi-time
Legendre transform, they are equivalent to a system of commuting Hamiltonian
flows. Involutivity of the Hamilton functions turns out to be equivalent to
closeness of the Lagrangian 1-form on solutions of the multi-time
Euler-Lagrange equations. In the discrete time context, the analogous extremal
property turns out to be characteristic for systems of commuting symplectic
maps. For one-parameter families of commuting symplectic maps (B\""acklund
transformations), we show that their spectrality property, introduced by
Kuznetsov and Sklyanin, is equivalent to the property of the Lagrangian 1-form
to be closed on solutions of the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations, and
propose a procedure of constructing Lax representations starting from the maps
themselves.

spin representation of the tensors on a sphere and two different approaches to
solve the master equation, we are able to determine two simple and explicitly
time-dependent solutions. Both solutions, of which one is asymptotically flat,
comply with the regularity conditions at the vertex of the null cone. For the
asymptotically flat solution we calculate the corresponding linearized

Minkowskian background spacetime. We also analyze the asymptotic behavior of
this solution at null infinity using a Penrose compactification, and calculate
the Weyl scalar, \Psi_4. Because of its simplicity, the asymptotically flat
solution presented here is ideally suited for testbed calculations in the
Bondi-Sachs formulation of numerical relativity. It may be considered as a
sibling of the well-known Teukolsky-Rinne solutions, on spacelike
hypersurfaces, for a metric adapted to null hypersurfaces.

Recent evidence has emerged pointing to the existence of three such fundamental
adinkras associated with distinct equivalence classes of a Coxeter group. A
partial description of these adinkras is given in terms of two types, termed
cis-and trans-adinkras (the latter being a degenerate doublet) in analogy to
cis/trans isomers in chemistry. Through a new and simple procedure that uses
adinkras, we find the irreducible off-shell adinkra representations of 4D,
$\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity, in the old-minimal, non-minimal, and conformal
formulations. This procedure uncovers what appears to be a selection rule
useful to reverse engineer adinkras to higher dimensions. We categorize the
supergravity representations in terms of the number of cis-($n_c$) and
trans-($n_t$) adinkras in the representation and synthesize our new results
with our previous supersymmetry genomics results into a group theoretic

reveal that gender differences in publication rate and impact are
discipline-specific. Our results also support two hypotheses. First, the
widely-reported lower publication rates of female faculty are correlated with
the amount of research resources typically needed in the discipline considered,
and thus may be explained by the lower level of institutional support
historically received by females. Second, in disciplines where pursuing an
academic position incurs greater career risk, female faculty tend to have a
greater fraction of higher impact publications than males. Our findings have
significant, field-specific, policy implications for achieving diversity at the

we identify the nature of this breakdown: High-momentum gravitons in the
gravitational dual get stretched into relatively large classical string loops
by tidal forces associated with the black brane. These stringy excitations of
the graviton are not contained in the supergravity approximation, but we show
that the jet stopping problem can nonetheless still be solved by drawing on
various string-theory methods (the eikonal approximation, the Penrose limit,
string quantization in pp-wave backgrounds) to obtain a probability
distribution for the late-time classical string loops. In extreme cases, we
find that the gravitons are stretched into very long folded strings which are
qualitatively similar to the folded classical strings originally used by
Gubser, Gulotta, Pufu and Rocha to model the jet stopping problem. This makes a
connection in certain cases between the different methods that have been used
to study jet stopping with AdS/CFT and gives a specific example of a precise
N=4 SYM problem that generates such strings in the gravity description.

corresponds to exchange of spin-j\in 2Z states in the graviton trajectory.
Deeply virtual compton scattering (DVCS) is essentially a 2 to 2 scattering
process of a hadron and a photon, and hence one should be able to study
non-perturbative aspects (GPD) of this process by the ""Pomeron"" process in
gravity dual. We find, however, that even the most developed formulation of
gravity dual Pomeron (Brower--Polchinski--Strassler--Tan (BPST) 2006) is not
able to capture skewness dependence of GPD properly. Conformal operator product
expansion allows us to determine DVCS amplitude in terms of matrix elements of
primary operators, which should then be given by wavefunctions on warped
spacetime. We determined all the necessary wavefunctions on AdS$_5$ as an
expression holomorphic in $j$, which will then be used (in our forthcoming
publication) to determine GPD through inverse Mellin transformation. This
approach will extend the formulation of BPST.

yields in Au+Au collisions while a photon isolation cut is applied in p+p. I_
AA, the ratio of jet fragment yield in Au+Au to that in p+p, indicates
modification of the jet fragmentation function. Suppression, most likely due to
energy loss in the medium, is seen at high z_T. The fragment yield at low z_T
is enhanced at large angles. Such a trend is expected from redistribution of
the lost energy into increased production of low-momentum particles.

periodically-driven systems of non-interacting particles. These phenomena are
identified through analogies between the Floquet spectra of driven systems and
the band structures of static Hamiltonians. Intriguingly, these works have
revealed that the topological characterization of driven systems is richer than
that of static systems. In particular, in driven systems in two dimensions
(2D), robust chiral edge states can appear even though the Chern numbers of all
the bulk Floquet bands are zero. Here we elucidate the crucial distinctions
between static and driven 2D systems, and construct a new topological invariant
that yields the correct edge state structure in the driven case. We provide
formulations in both the time and frequency domains, which afford additional
insight into the origins of the ""anomalous"" spectra which arise in driven

crystalline approximant method utilizes periodic structures to approximate
quasicrystals. The errors of this approach come from two parts: the numerical
discretization, and the approximate error of Simultaneous Diophantine
Approximation which also determines the size of the domain necessary for
accurate solution. As the approximate error decreases, the computational
complexity grows rapidly, and moreover, the approximate error always exits
unless the computational region is the full space. In this work we focus on the
development of numerical method to compute quasicrystals with high accuracy.
With the help of higher-dimensional reciprocal space, a new projection method
is developed to compute quasicrystals. The approach enables us to calculate
quasicrystals rather than crystalline approximants. Compared with the
crystalline approximant method, the projection method overcomes the
restrictions of the Simultaneous Diophantine Approximation, and can also use
periodic boundary conditions conveniently. Meanwhile, the proposed method
efficiently reduces the computational complexity through implementing in a unit
cell and using pseudospectral method. For illustrative purpose we work with the
Lifshitz-Petrich model, though our present algorithm will apply to more general
systems including quasicrystals. We find that the projection method can
maintain the rotational symmetry accurately. More significantly, the algorithm
can calculate the free energy density to high precision.

measure the shear correlation function on angular scales in the range ~1-40

period of the white dwarf, we observed V455 And with 2s integration times,
which is significantly shorter than the spin rate of the white dwarf. To
achieve this cadence, we used the blue arm of the ISIS spectrograph at the
4.2-m William Herschel Telescope, equipped with an electron multiplying CCD
(EMCCD). Strong coherent signals were detected in our time series, which lead
to a robust determination of the spin period of the white dwarf (Pspin=67.619
+/- 0.002 s). Folding the spectra on the white dwarf spin period uncovered very
complex emission line variations in Hgamma, He I 4472 and He II 4686. We
attribute the observed spin phase dependence of the emission line shape to the
presence of magnetically controlled accretion onto the white dwarf via
accretion curtains, consistent with an intermediate polar type system. We are,
however, not aware of any specific model that can quantitatively explain the
complex velocity variations we detect in our observations. The orbital
variations in the spectral lines indicate that the accretion disc of V455 And
is rather structureless, contrary to the disc of the prototype of the
intermediate polars, DQ Her. This work demonstrates the potential of electron
multiplying CCDs to observe faint targets at high cadence, as readout noise
would make such a study impossible with conventional CCDs.

light profiles with multi-wavelength data increases the stability and accuracy
of the measured parameters, and hence produces more complete and meaningful
multi-wavelength photometry than has been available previously. The improvement
is particularly significant for magnitudes in low S/N bands and for structural
parameters like half-light radius re and S\'ersic index n for which a prior is
used by constraining these parameters to a polynomial as a function of
wavelength. This allows the fitting routines to push the magnitude of galaxies
for which sensible values can be derived to fainter limits. The technique
utilises a smooth transition of galaxy parameters with wavelength, creating
more physically meaningful transitions than single-band fitting and allows
accurate interpolation between passbands, perfect for derivation of rest-frame
values.

to study processes with high spatial and temporal dynamic range. It reduces
computational requirements by adapting the lattice on which the underlying
differential equations are solved to most efficiently represent the solution.
Particularly in astrophysics and cosmology such simulations now can capture
spatial scales ten orders of magnitude apart and more. The irregular locations
and extensions of the refined regions in the SAMR scheme and the fact that
different resolution levels partially overlap, poses a challenge for GPU-based
direct volume rendering methods. kD-trees have proven to be advantageous to
subdivide the data domain into non-overlapping blocks of equally sized cells,
optimal for the texture units of current graphics hardware, but previous
GPU-supported raycasting approaches for SAMR data using this data structure
required a separate rendering pass for each node, preventing the application of
many advanced lighting schemes that require simultaneous access to more than
one block of cells. In this paper we present a single-pass GPU-raycasting
algorithm for SAMR data that is based on a kD-tree. The tree is efficiently
encoded by a set of 3D-textures, which allows to adaptively sample complete
rays entirely on the GPU without any CPU interaction. We discuss two different
data storage strategies to access the grid data on the GPU and apply them to
several datasets to prove the benefits of the proposed method.

disks in the Serpens Molecular Cloud, based on photometry and Spitzer IRS
spectra. Taking a distance to the cloud of 415 pc rather than 259 pc, the
distribution of ages is shifted to lower values, in the 1-3 Myr range, with a
tail up to 10 Myr. The mass distribution spans 0.2-1.2 Msun, with median mass
of 0.7 Msun. The distribution of fractional disk luminosities in Serpens
resembles that of the young Taurus Molecular Cloud, with most disks consistent
with optically thick, passively irradiated disks in a variety of disk
geometries (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.1). In contrast, the distributions for the older
Upper Scorpius and Eta Chamaeleontis clusters are dominated by optically thin
lower luminosity disks (Ldisk/Lstar ~ 0.02). This evolution in fractional disk
luminosities is concurrent with that of disk fractions. The actively accreting
and non-accreting stars (based on Ha data) in Serpens show very similar
distributions in fractional disk luminosities, differing only in the brighter
tail dominated by strongly accreting stars. In contrast with a sample of Herbig
Ae/Be stars, the T Tauri stars in Serpens do not have a clear separation in
fractional disk luminosities for different disk geometries: both flared and
flat disks present wider, overlapping distributions. This result is consistent
with previous suggestions of a faster evolution for disks around Herbig Ae/Be
stars. Furthermore, the results for the mineralogy of the dust in the disk
surface do not show any correlation to either stellar and disk characteristics
or mean cluster age in the 1-10 Myr range probed here. A possible explanation
for the lack of correlation is that the processes affecting the dust within
disks have short timescales, happening repeatedly, making it difficult to
distinguish long lasting evolutionary effects. [abridged]

phase behavior depends strongly on the density and on the stiffness of the
harmonic confinement. Whilst we find the familiar sequence of confined
hexagonal and square-symmetric packings, we do not observe any of the usual
intervening ordered phases. Instead, the system phase separates under strong
confinement, or forms a layered re-entrant liquid phase under weaker
confinement. It is plausible that this behavior is due to the larger positional
freedom in a soft confining potential and to the contribution that the
confinement energy makes to the total free energy. The fact that specific
structures can be induced or suppressed by simply changing the confinement
conditions (e.g. in a dielectrophoretic trap) is important for applications

individually derived stellar masses and Delta AKs ~ 1 magnitude in acquired
Ks-band extinction, while the present-day mass function slope changes by ~ 0.17
dex. The present-day mass function slope derived assuming the more recent
extinction law increases from a flat slope of alpha_{Nishi}=-1.50 \pm0.35 in

conjunctive queries despite the non-terminating chase. We provide tight
complexity bounds for the problem of conjunctive query evaluation for several
classes of TGDs. We then introduce EGDs, and provide a condition under which
EGDs do not interact with TGDs, and therefore do not take part in query
answering. We show applications of our classes of constraints to the problem of

predict a possible enhancement of the hadroproduction rate associated with

those events to probe the possible existence of color adjoint scalar particles.

supersymmetric models where sgluon fields decay dominantly into top quarks. We
then use this model to analyze the sensitivity of the Large Hadron Collider in
both a multilepton plus jets and a single lepton plus jets channel. After
having based our event selection strategy on the possible presence of two,
three and four top quarks in the final state, we find that sgluon-induced new
physics contributions to multitop cross sections as low as 10-100 fb can be
excluded at the 95% confidence level, assuming an integrated luminosity of 20
inverse fb. Equivalently, sgluon masses of about 500-700 GeV can be reached for
several classes of benchmark scenarios.

Switching between the wells without energy dissipation requires time-modulating
the potential barrier separating them and tilting the profile towards the
desired well at the precise juncture when the barrier disappears. This demands
perfect timing synchronization and is therefore fault-intolerant, even in the
absence of noise. A fault-tolerant strategy that requires no time modulation of
the barrier (and hence no timing synchronization) switches by tilting the
profile by an amount at least equal to the barrier height and dissipates at
least that amount of energy. Here, we present a third strategy that requires a
time modulated barrier but no timing synchronization. It is therefore
fault-tolerant in the absence of thermal noise and yet it dissipates
arbitrarily small energy since an arbitrarily small tilt is required for slow
and adiabatic switching. This case is exemplified with stress induced switching
of a shape-anisotropic single-domain nanomagnet dipole coupled to a neighbor.
We also show by examining various energy profiles and the corresponding
probability distributions that when thermal noise is present, the minimum
energy dissipated to switch in this scheme is 2kTln(1/p) [p = switching error
probability].

pave the way for the evolution of the multicarrier schemes from the current

how to transmit, i.e., filters, and where/when to transmit, i.e., lattice.

considering four different design perspectives: energy concentration, rapid
decay, spectrum nulling, and channel/hardware characteristics. Subsequently,
evaluation tools which may be used to compare different filters in multicarrier
schemes are studied. Finally, multicarrier schemes are evaluated from the view
of the practical implementation issues, such as lattice adaptation,

  in Cognitive Radio Networks","30 pages, one column, double space",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/","  This paper studies price-based spectrum access control in cognitive radio
networks, which characterizes network operators' service provisions to
delay-sensitive secondary users (SUs) via pricing strategies. Based on the two
paradigms of shared-use and exclusive-use dynamic spectrum access (DSA), we
examine three network scenarios corresponding to three types of secondary
markets. In the first monopoly market with one operator using opportunistic
shared-use DSA, we study the operator's pricing effect on the equilibrium
behaviors of self-optimizing SUs in a queueing system. %This queue represents
the congestion of the multiple SUs sharing the operator's single \ON-\OFF
channel that models the primary users (PUs) traffic. We provide a queueing
delay analysis with the general distributions of the SU service time and PU
traffic using the renewal theory. In terms of SUs, we show that there exists a
unique Nash equilibrium in a non-cooperative game where SUs are players
employing individual optimal strategies. We also provide a sufficient condition
and iterative algorithms for equilibrium convergence. In terms of operators,
two pricing mechanisms are proposed with different goals: revenue maximization
and social welfare maximization. In the second monopoly market, an operator
exploiting exclusive-use DSA has many channels that will be allocated
separately to each entering SU. We also analyze the pricing effect on the
equilibrium behaviors of the SUs and the revenue-optimal and socially-optimal
pricing strategies of the operator in this market. In the third duopoly market,
we study a price competition between two operators employing shared-use and
exclusive-use DSA, respectively, as a two-stage Stackelberg game. Using a
backward induction method, we show that there exists a unique equilibrium for
this game and investigate the equilibrium convergence.

it is shown that for strongly attractive interaction potential with soft core
(allowing interpenetration between the solute-solvent pair) the diffusion
exhibits a non-monotonic size dependence. This was earlier predicted in
simulation and experimental studies and was connected to levitation effect [J.
Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, 5824-5835]. Our MCT analysis reveals that for weak or
no attractive interactions, all the small solute particles studied here show
levitation through the inter-solvent transient cage. However, for strong
attractive interaction the levitation is not present for the smallest particle
sizes. It is found that for systems where the interaction potential is hard,
not allowing any interpenetration between the solute-solvent pair, the solute
cannot explore the inter-solvent cage. Thus these systems will never show any
non monotonic size dependence of diffusion. We also show that although
levitation is a dynamic phenomena, the effect of levitation can be obtained in
the radial distribution function.

$r\in S$, a positive integer cost and a delay on every edge and a delay
constraint $D\in Z^{+}$, the shallow-light Steiner tree (\emph{SLST}) problem
is to compute a minimum cost tree spanning the terminals of $S$, in which the
delay between root and every vertex is restrained by $D$. This problem is
NP-hard and very hard to approximate. According to known inapproximability
results, this problem admits no approximation with ratio better than factor
$(1,\, O(\log^{2}n))$ unless $NP\subseteq DTIME(n^{\log\log n})$
\cite{khandekar2013some}, while it admits no approximation ratio better than
$(1,\, O(\log|V|))$ for D=4 unless $NP\subseteq DTIME(n^{\log\log n})$
\cite{bar2001generalized}. Hence, the paper focus on parameterized algorithm
for \emph{SLST}. We firstly present an exact algorithm for \emph{SLST} with
time complexity $O(3^{|S|}|V|D+2^{|S|}|V|^{2}D^{2}+|V|^{3}D^{3})$, where $|S|$
and $|V|$ are the number of terminals and vertices respectively. This is a
pseudo polynomial time parameterized algorithm with respect to the
parameterization: ""number of terminals"". Later, we improve this algorithm such
that it runs in polynomial time
$O(\frac{|V|^{2}}{\epsilon}3^{|S|}+\frac{|V|^{4}}{\epsilon}2^{|S|}+\frac{|V|^{6}}{\epsilon})$,
and computes a Steiner tree with delay bounded by $(1+\epsilon)D$ and cost
bounded by the cost of an optimum solution, where $\epsilon>0$ is any small
real number. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first parameterized
approximation algorithm for the \emph{SLST} problem.

this review. It is very predictive and makes it possible to construct all mass
matrices including those of the Dirac and heavy right-handed Majorana
neutrinos. So it is not only able to reproduce all the low energy data, except
for too larger $\theta_{13}$ in the lepton mixing angles (which can be evaded
without spoiling the basic ingredients), but also predicts almost all new
physics beyond the standard model (SM) like neutrinoless double beta decay, the
electric and magnetic dipole moments of the quark-lepton, lepton flavour
violation, leptogenesis etc. To be very predictive, on the other hand, implies
that predictions are unambiguous and they are always exposed to severe
compatibilities with observations as well as to a conceptual consistency check.
The explicit construction of the Higgs superpotential and the explicit display
of a symmetry breaking pattern from GUT to the SM show that the naive desert
from the SM to GUT in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is a too
simplified concept and we have many definitely determined intermediate energy

orbiting around a massive host galaxy, and focus on its dependence on the
morphology of both satellite and host galaxy. For this purpose, we use three
different morphologies for the satellites: pure disc, pure bulge and a mixture
bulge+disc. Two morphologies are used for the host galaxies: bulge+disc and
pure bulge. We find that while the spheroidal stellar component experiences a
constant power-law like mass removal, the disc is exposed to an exponential
mass loss when the tidal radius of the satellite is of the same order of the
disc scale length. This dramatic mass loss is able to completely remove the
stellar component on time scale of 100 Myears. As a consequence two satellites
with the same stellar and dark matter masses, on the same orbit could either
retain considerable fraction of their stellar mass after 10 Gyrs or being
completely destroyed, depending on their initial stellar morphology. We find
that there are two characteristic time scales describing the beginning and the
end of the disc removal, whose values are related to the size of the disc. This
result can be easily incorporated in semi-analytical models. We also find that
the host morphology and the orbital parameters also have an effect on the
determining the mass removal, but they are of secondary importance with respect
to satellite morphology. We conclude that satellite morphology has a very
strong effect on the efficiency of stellar stripping and should be taken into
account in modeling galaxy formation and evolution.

applied magnetic field. The simulation scheme is based on a model accounting
for the nonlinear and nonlocal electrodynamics of superconductors in the

Joule heating, heat conduction in the film, and heat transfer to the substrate,
a wide variety of avalanche patterns is formed, and quantitative

the areal size. The morphology shows significant dependence also on the initial

distributed contexts. In addition to their versatility, their balanced shape
ensures an overall satisfactory performance. Re- cently, it has been shown that
their distributed implementations can be fault-resilient. However, this

conversion of turbulent into magnetic energy. In astrophysical environments,
such turbulence often occurs at high Mach numbers, implying steep slopes in the
turbulent spectra. It is thus a central question whether the small-scale dynamo
can amplify magnetic fields in the interstellar or intergalactic media, where
such Mach numbers occur. To address this long-standing issue, we employ the
Kazantsev model for turbulent magnetic field amplification, systematically
exploring the effect of different turbulent slopes, as expected for Kolmogorov,
Burgers, the Larson laws and results derived from numerical simulations. With
the framework employed here, we give the first solution encompassing the
complete range of magnetic Prandtl numbers, including Pm << 1, Pm ~ 1 and Pm >>
1. We derive scaling laws of the growth rate as a function of hydrodynamic and
magnetic Reynolds number for Pm << 1 and Pm >> 1 for all types of turbulence. A
central result concerns the regime of Pm ~ 1, where the magnetic field
amplification rate increases rapidly as a function of Pm. This phenomenon
occurs for all types of turbulence we explored. We further find that the dynamo
growth rate can be decreased by a few orders of magnitude for turbulence
spectra steeper than Kolmogorov. We calculate the critical magnetic Reynolds
number Rm_c for magnetic field amplification, which is highest for the Burgers
case. As expected, our calculation shows a linear behaviour of the
amplification rate close to the threshold proportional to Rm-Rm_c. Based on the
Kazantsev model, we therefore expect the existence of the small-scale dynamo
for any given value of Pm, as long as the magnetic Reynolds number is above the
critical threshold.

studied by Density Functional Theory calculations. First we study the
adsorption of L-lactic acid on the flat Pt(111) surface. Using the oPBE-vdW
functional which includes van der Waals forces on an ab initio level, it is
shown that the molecule has two binding sites, a carboxyl and the hydroxyl
oxygen atoms. Since real chiral surfaces are (i) known to undergo thermal
roughening that alters the distribution of kinks and step edges but not the
overall chirality and (ii) kink sites and edge sites are usually the
energetically most favored adsorption sites, we focus on two surfaces that
allow qualitative sampling of the most probable adsorption sites. We hereby
consider chiral surfaces exhibiting (111) facets, in particular Pt(321) and
Pt(643). The binding sites are either both on kink sites - which is the case
for Pt(321) or on one kink site - as on Pt(643). The binding energy of the
molecule on the chiral surfaces is much higher than on the Pt(111) surface. We
show that the carboxyl group interacts more strongly than the hydroxyl group
with the kink sites. The results reveal rather small chiral selectivities on
the order of 20 meV for the Pt(321) and Pt(643) surfaces. L-lactic acid is more
stable on Pt(321)$^S$ than D-lactic acid, while the chiral selectivity is
inverted on Pt(643)$^S$. The most stable adsorption configurations of L- and
D-lactic acid are similar for Pt(321) but differ for Pt(643). We explore the
impact of the different adsorption geometries on the work function which is
important for field ion microscopy.

spectral fit of the optical/UV data. We compute ensemble structure functions to
analyse variability of multi-epoch data. We find a strong ""intrinsic

the total variance) to the dispersion of the $\alpha_{ox}-L_{UV}$
anti-correlation (""intra-source dispersion""). The strong X-ray variability and
weaker UV variability of this sample are comparable to other samples of low-z
AGNs, and are neither due to the high fraction of strongly variable NLS1s, nor
to dilution of the optical variability by the host galaxies. Dilution affects
instead the slope of the anti-correlation, which steepens, once corrected,
becoming similar to higher luminosity sources. The structure function of
$\alpha_{ox}$ increases with the time lag up to $\sim$1 month. This indicates
the important contribution of the intermediate-long timescale variations,

generalize findings from the study group to the whole population. Generalizing
findings is obviously harder than detecting activation in the study group since
in order to be significant, an activation has to be larger than the
inter-subject variability. Indeed, detected regions are smaller when using
random effect analysis versus fixed effects. The statistical assumptions behind
the classic random effects model are that the effect in each location is
normally distributed over subjects, and ""activation"" refers to a non-null mean
effect. We argue this model is unrealistic compared to the true population
variability, where, due to functional plasticity and registration anomalies, at
each brain location some of the subjects are active and some are not. We
propose a finite-Gaussian--mixture--random-effect. A model that amortizes
between-subject spatial disagreement and quantifies it using the ""prevalence""
of activation at each location. This measure has several desirable properties:
(a) It is more informative than the typical active/inactive paradigm. (b) In
contrast to the hypothesis testing approach (thus t-maps) which are trivially
rejected for large sample sizes, the larger the sample size, the more
informative the prevalence statistic becomes.
  In this work we present a formal definition and an estimation procedure of
this prevalence. The end result of the proposed analysis is a map of the
prevalence at locations with significant activation, highlighting activations
regions that are common over many brains.

the Local Group. The dwarfs are initially composed of stellar disks embedded in
dark matter haloes with different inner density slopes and are placed on an
eccentric orbit typical for MW subhaloes. After a few Gyr of evolution the
stellar component is triaxial as a result of bar instability induced by tidal
forces. Observing the simulated dwarfs along three principal axes of the
stellar component we create mock data sets and determine the their half-light
radii and line-of-sight velocity dispersions. Using the estimator proposed by
Wolf et al. we calculate masses within half-light radii. The masses obtained
this way are over(under)estimated by up to a factor of two when the line of
sight is along the longest (shortest) axis of the stellar component. We then
divide the initial stellar distribution into an inner and outer population and
trace their evolution in time. The two populations, although affected by tidal
forces, retain different density profiles even after a few Gyr. We measure the
half-light radii and velocity dispersions of the stars in the two populations
along different lines of sight and use them to estimate the slope of the mass
distribution in the dwarfs following the method proposed by Walker &
Penarrubia. The inferred slopes are systematically over- or underestimated,
depending on the line of sight. In particular, when the dwarf is seen along the
longest axis of the stellar component, a significantly shallower density
profile is inferred than the real one measured from the simulations. Since most
dSphs are non-spherical and their orientation with respect to our line of sight
is unknown, the method can be reliably applied only to a large sample of dwarfs
when these systematic errors are expected to be diminished.

memristors as plastic connections, i.e. whose weights can vary during a trial.
The evolutionary design process exploits parameter self-adaptation and variable

inter-neural connectivity pattern to emerge. By comparing two phenomenological
real-world memristor implementations with networks comprised of (i) linear
resistors (ii) constant-valued connections, we demonstrate that this approach
allows the evolution of networks of appropriate complexity to emerge whilst
exploiting the memristive properties of the connections to reduce learning
time. We extend this approach to allow for heterogeneous mixtures of memristors
within the networks; our approach provides an in-depth analysis of network
structure. Our networks are evaluated on simulated robotic navigation tasks;
results demonstrate that memristive plasticity enables higher performance than
constant-weighted connections in both static and dynamic reward scenarios, and
that mixtures of memristive elements provide performance advantages when
compared to homogeneous memristive networks.

proposed a method to treat first order phase transitions at low temperatures.
It describes arbitrary order parameter through an analytical expression $W$,
which depends on few coefficients. Such coefficients can be calculated by
simulating relatively small systems, hence with a low computational cost. The
method determines the precise location of coexistence lines and arbitrary
response functions (from proper derivatives of $W$). Here we exploit and extend
the approach, discussing a more general condition for its validity. We show
that in fact it works beyond the low $T$ limit, provided the first order phase
transition is strong enough. Thus, $W$ can be used even to study athermal
problems, as exemplified for a hard-core lattice gas. We furthermore
demonstrate that other relevant thermodynamic quantities, as entropy and
energy, are also obtained from $W$. To clarify some important mathematical
features of the method, we analyze in details an analytically solvable problem.
Finally, we discuss different representative models, namely, Potts, Bell-Lavis,
and associating gas-lattice, illustrating the procedure broad applicability.

near the orbital phase $\phi_{orb}= 0.25$, which is not seen in the softer 2-10
keV energy band. Such a shape is likely to be due to a complex asymmetric
structure of the funnel in a supercritical accretion disk in SS433. The orbital
light curve at 40-60 keV demonstrates two almost equal bumps at phases $\sim
0.25$ and $\sim 0.75$, most likely due to nutation effects of the accretion
disk. The change of the off-eclipse 18-60 keV X-ray flux with the precessional

correlated with the disk precessional phase is also observed. The joint

instrumental response is derived from regular observations of PSR J0437-4715
based on the assumption that the mean polarized emission from this millisecond
pulsar remains constant over time. The technique is applicable to any
experiment in which high-fidelity polarimetry is required over long time
scales; it is demonstrated by calibrating 7.2 years of high-precision timing
observations of PSR J1022+1001 made at the Parkes Observatory. Application of
the new technique followed by arrival time estimation using matrix template
matching yields post-fit residuals with an uncertainty-weighted standard
deviation of 880 ns, two times smaller than that of arrival time residuals
obtained via conventional methods of calibration and arrival time estimation.
The precision achieved by this experiment yields the first significant
measurements of the secular variation of the projected semi-major axis, the
precession of periastron, and the Shapiro delay; it also places PSR J1022+1001
among the ten best pulsars regularly observed as part of the Parkes Pulsar
Timing Array (PPTA) project. It is shown that the timing accuracy of a large
fraction of the pulsars in the PPTA is currently limited by the systematic
timing error due to instrumental polarization artifacts. More importantly,
long-term variations of systematic error are correlated between different
pulsars, which adversely affects the primary objectives of any pulsar timing
array experiment. These limitations may be overcome by adopting the techniques
presented in this work, which relax the demand for instrumental polarization
purity and thereby have the potential to reduce the development cost of
next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array.

non-homogeneous material parameters. As an important application of the
developed numerical schemes, the functioning of the von-K\'{a}rm\'{a}n-sodium

field perturbations are utilized for the reconstruction of the velocity field.
The promises of CIFT for flow field monitoring in the continuous casting of

Reynolds numbers, some selected problems of non-linear inverse dynamo theory,
with possible application to geo- and astrophysics, are also discussed.

this paper using a combination of the $b$-pseudodifferential operator calculus

construction simplifies and generalizes the construction done by Vaillant in
his thesis for the Dirac operator.
  In addition, we study the mapping properties of these operators and determine
the appropriate Hlibert spaces between which the Gauss-Bonnet and Hodge Laplace

Starting from an algebra naturally associated to this space, a Hilbert space is

The weight satisfies a KMS condition and its associated modular operator plays
an important role in the construction. This forces us to introduce two
ingredients which have a modular flavor: the first is a twisted commutator,
used to obtain a boundedness condition for the Dirac operator, the second is a
weight replacing the usual operator trace, used to measure the growth of the
resolvent of the Dirac operator. We show that, under some assumptions related
to the symmetries and the classical limit, there is a unique Dirac operator and
automorphism such that the twisted commutator is bounded. Then, using the

computational cost of the ""standard"" intuitive algorithm which samples directly

luminosities that are below the luminosities of previously detected ultracool
dwarfs. Combining our results with those from the literature gives a detection
rate for dwarfs in the spectral range M7 -- L3.5 of ~ 9%. In comparison, only
one dwarf later than L3.5 is detected in 53 observations. We report the
observed detection rate as a function of spectral type, and the number
distribution of the dwarfs as a function of spectral type and rotation
velocity. The radio observations to date point to a drop in the detection rate
toward the ultracool dwarfs. However, the emission levels of detected ultracool
dwarfs are comparable to those of earlier type active M dwarfs, which may imply
that a mildly relativistic electron beam or a strong magnetic field can exist
in ultracool dwarfs. Fast rotation may be a sufficient condition to produce
magnetic fields strengths of several hundreds Gauss to several kilo Gauss, as
suggested by the data for the active ultracool dwarfs with known rotation
rates. A possible reason for the non-detection of radio emission from some
dwarfs is that maybe the centrifugal acceleration mechanism in these dwarfs is
weak (due to a low rotation rate) and thus cannot provide the necessary density
and/or energy of accelerated electrons. An alternative explanation could be
long-term variability, as is the case for several ultracool dwarfs whose radio
emission varies considerably over long periods with emission levels dropping
below the detection limit in some instances.

investigate the transition to periodic activity using a model system comprising
a lattice of excitable cells, each being coupled to a variable number of

spatial disorder. Close to the transition between quiescent state and sustained
oscillations in the system we observe large fluctuations between different
replicas induced by variations in the local density of passive cells around an
excitable cell. We demonstrate that the disorder-induced fluctuations can be
described in terms of a simple scaling relation which involves the strength of
coupling between excitable cells, the mean passive cell density, as well as the
logarithm of the system size. Our results can be interpreted as suggesting that

behavioural perspective that centres on movement by muscle contraction.
Building on the finding that molecules for chemical neural signalling predate
multicellular animals, we investigate a gradual evolutionary scenario for
nervous systems that consists of two stages: A) Chemically transmission of
electrical activity between adjacent cells provided a primitive form of muscle
coordination in a contractile epithelial tissue. B) This primitive form of
coordination was subsequently improved upon by evolving the axodendritic
processes of modern neurons. We use computer simulations to investigate the
first stage. The simulations show that chemical transmission across a
contractile sheet can indeed produce useful body scale patterns, but only for
small-sized animals. For larger animals the noise in chemical neural signalling
interferes. Our results imply that a two-stage scenario is a viable approach to
nervous system evolution. The first stage could provide an initial behavioural
advantage, as well as a clear scaffold for subsequent improvements in
behavioural coordination.

overestimate divergences considerably. In these examples the main improvements
arise from a conjectured duality between color and kinematics. In this paper we
initiate the systematic study of quite general powercounting under the
assumption that color-kinematic duality exists. The main technical tool is a
reformulation of the duality in terms of linear maps, modulo subtleties at loop
level mostly inherent to the duality. This tool may have wider applications in
both gauge and gravity theories, up to resolution of the subtleties. Here it is
first applied to the large Britto-Cachazo-Feng-Witten (BCFW) shift behavior of
gravity integrands constructed through the duality. Assuming color-kinematic
duality and reasonable technical requirements hold these shifts are shown to be
independent of loop order, which would imply massive cancellations with respect
to the Feynman graph expression. More speculatively, the same approach is then
applied to provide estimates of the overall degree of UV divergence in quite
general gravity theories, assuming the duality exists. The cancellations
obtained in these estimates depends on the exact implementation of the duality
at loop level, especially on graph topology. Finally, some evidence for the
duality to all loop orders is provided from an analysis of BCFW shifts of gauge

puzzle to astronomers. Their growth becomes reasonable only when starting from
a massive seed black hole with mass of the order of 10^2 - 10^5 M_SUN.
Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are therefore an important field of
research. Especially the possibility of finding them in the centers of globular
clusters has recently drawn attention. The search for IMBHs in the centers of
globular clusters could therefore shed light on the process of black-hole
formation and cluster evolution. We are investigating six galactic globular
clusters for the presence of an IMBH at their centers. Based on their kinematic
and photometric properties, we selected the globular clusters NGC 1851, NGC
1904 (M79), NGC 5694, NGC 5824, NGC 6093 (M80) and NGC 6266 (M62). We use
integral field spectroscopy in order to obtain the central velocity-dispersion
profile of each cluster. We compute the cluster photometric center and the
surface brightness profile using HST data. After combining these datasets we
compare them to analytic Jeans models. We use varying M/L_V profiles for
clusters with enough data points in order to reproduce their kinematic profiles
in an optimal way. Finally, we vary the mass of the central black hole and test
whether the cluster is better fitted with or without an IMBH. We present the
statistical significance, including upper limits, of the black-hole mass for
each cluster. NGC 1904 and NGC 6266 provide the highest significance for a
black hole. Jeans models in combination with a M/L_V profile obtained from
N-body simulations (in the case of NGC 6266) predict a central black hole of
M_BH = (3 +- 1) x 10^3 M_SUN for NGC 1904 and M_BH = (2 +- 1) x 10^3 M_SUN for
NGC 6266. Furthermore, we discuss the possible influence of dark remnants and
mass segregation at the center of the cluster on the detection of an IMBH.

systems. These works have allowed users to significantly speed up selective
MapReduce jobs by orders of magnitude. However, all these proposals require
users to create indexes upfront, which might be a difficult task in certain
applications (such as in scientific and social applications) where workloads
are evolving or hard to predict. To overcome this problem, we propose LIAH
(Lazy Indexing and Adaptivity in Hadoop), a parallel, adaptive approach for
indexing at minimal costs for MapReduce systems. The main idea of LIAH is to
automatically and incrementally adapt to users' workloads by creating clustered
indexes on HDFS data blocks as a byproduct of executing MapReduce jobs. Besides
distributing indexing efforts over multiple computing nodes, LIAH also
parallelises indexing with both map tasks computation and disk I/O. All this
without any additional data copy in main memory and with minimal
synchronisation. The beauty of LIAH is that it piggybacks index creation on map
tasks, which read relevant data from disk to main memory anyways. Hence, LIAH
does not introduce any additional read I/O-costs and exploit free CPU cycles.
As a result and in contrast to existing adaptive indexing works, LIAH has a
very low (or invisible) indexing overhead, usually for the very first job.
Still, LIAH can quickly converge to a complete index, i.e. all HDFS data blocks
are indexed. Especially, LIAH can trade early job runtime improvements with
fast complete index convergence. We compare LIAH with HAIL, a state-of-the-art
indexing technique, as well as with standard Hadoop with respect to indexing
overhead and workload performance.

solving a lattice version of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The constraint of
diffeomorphism invariance is strong enough to uniquely determine the structure
of the vacuum wave functional in the limit of infinitely fine triangulations of
the three-sphere. In the large fluctuation regime the nature of the wave
function solution is such that a physically acceptable ground state emerges,
with a finite non-perturbative correlation length naturally cutting off any
infrared divergences. The location of the critical point in Newton's constant
$G_c$, separating the weak from the strong coupling phase, is obtained, and it
is inferred from the structure of the wave functional that fluctuations in the
curvatures become unbounded at this point. Investigations of the vacuum wave
functional further suggest that for weak enough coupling, $G<G_c$, a
pathological ground state with no continuum limit appears, where configurations
with small curvature have vanishingly small probability. One is then lead to
the conclusion that the weak coupling, perturbative ground state of quantum
gravity is non-perturbatively unstable, and that gravitational screening cannot
be physically realized in the lattice theory. The results we find are in
general agreement with the Euclidean lattice gravity results, and lend further
support to the claim that the Lorentzian and Euclidean lattice formulations for

alphabets with one player trying to rewrite the input string to match a target
specification. These games have been investigated in the context of exchanging
Active XML (AXML) data. While it was known that the rewriting problem is
undecidable in general, it is shown here that it is EXPSPACE-complete to decide
for a given context-free game, whether all safely rewritable strings can be
safely rewritten in a left-to-right manner, a problem that was previously
considered by Abiteboul et al. Furthermore, it is shown that the corresponding
problem for games with finite replacement languages is EXPTIME-complete.

measuring a set of observables. For a given pure state, we consider two
different types of uniqueness: (1) no other pure state is compatible with the
same measurement results and (2) no other state, pure or mixed, is compatible
with the same measurement results. For case (1), it is known that for a
d-dimensional Hilbert space, there exists a set of 4d-5 observables that
uniquely determines any pure state. We show that for case (2), 5d-7 observables
suffice to uniquely determine any pure state. Thus there is a gap between the
results for (1) and (2), and we give some examples to illustrate this. The case
of observables corresponding to reduced density matrices (RDMs) of a
multipartite system is also discussed, where we improve known bounds on local
dimensions for case (2) in which almost all pure states are uniquely determined
by their RDMs. We further discuss circumstances where (1) can imply (2). We use
convexity of the numerical range of operators to show that when only two
observables are measured, (1) always implies (2). More generally, if there is a
compact group of symmetries of the state space which has the span of the
observables measured as the set of fixed points, then (1) implies (2). We
analyze the possible dimensions for the span of such observables. Our results
extend naturally to the case of low rank quantum states.

using rest frame UV data from deep z_{850} ACS imaging. The star formation
present at high redshift is then extrapolated to z=0, and we examine the
stellar mass produced in individual regions within each galaxy. We also
construct new stellar mass profiles of the in-situ stellar mass at high
redshift from Sersic fits to rest-frame optical, H_{160}-band, data. We combine
the two stellar mass profiles to produce a modelled evolved stellar mass
profile. We then fit a new Sersic profile to the evolved profile, from which we
examine what effect the resulting stellar mass distribution added via star
formation has on the structure and size of each individual galaxy. We conclude
that due to the lack of sufficient size growth and Sersic evolution by star
formation other mechanisms such as merging must contribute a large proportion
to account for the observed structural evolution from z>1 to the present day.

scattering system to be able to rotate the linear polarisation of light: Lack
of at least one mirror plane of symmetry and electromagnetic duality symmetry.
Duality symmetry is equivalent to the conservation of the helicity of light in
the same way that rotational symmetry is equivalent to the conservation of
angular momentum. When the system is a solution of a single species of
particles, the lack of at least one mirror plane of symmetry leads to the
familiar requirement of chirality of the individual particle. With respect to
helicity preservation, according to the analytical and numerical evidence
presented in this paper, the solution preserves helicity if and only if the
individual particle itself preserves helicity. However, only in the particular
case of forward scattering the helicity preservation condition on the particle
is relaxed: We show that the random orientation of the molecules endows the
solution with an effective rotational symmetry; at its turn, this leads to
helicity preservation in the forward scattering direction independently of any
property of the particle. This is not the case for a general scattering
direction. These results advance the current understanding of the phenomena of
molecular optical activity and provide insight for the design of polarisation
control devices at the nanoscale.

Vandiver's work (1940) in connection with the first case of Fermat Last
Theorem. Vandiver proved that $x^p+y^p=z^p$ has no solution for integers
$x,y,z$ with $\gcd(xyz,p)=1$ if $E_{p-3}\equiv 0 (\bmod p)$. Numerous
combinatorial congruences recently obtained by Z.-W. Sun and by Z.-H. Sun

  For the computation of residues of Euler numbers $E_{p-3}$ modulo a prime
$p$, we use the congruence which runs significantly faster than other known
congruences involving $E_{p-3}$. Applying this congruence, a computation via
{\tt Mathematica 8} shows that only three primes less than $10^7$ satisfy the
condition $E_{p-3}\equiv 0 (\bmod p)$ (such primes are 149, 241 and 2946901,

computational results and statistical considerations similar to those on search

that there are infinitely many primes $p$ such that $E_{p-3}\equiv 0 (\bmod

approaches, an electrically neutral current-loop in its rest frame possesses
not only a MDM m, but also an electric dipole moment (EDM) p and a stationary
permanent magnet possesses not only an intrinsic magnetization M but also an
intrinsic electric polarization P. Hence, in a static electric field, both, a
