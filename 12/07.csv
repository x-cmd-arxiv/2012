pivotal role in various branches of science. While this issue can be rigorously
solved in polynomial time, it is still overly demanding for large scale
problems. Drawing inspiration from low-frequency electrodynamics, this paper
presents a physics inspired algorithm for first cohomology group computations
on three-dimensional complexes. The algorithm is general and exhibits orders of
magnitude speed up with respect to competing ones, allowing to handle problems
not addressable before. In particular, when generators are employed in the
physical modeling of magneto-quasistatic problems, this algorithm solves one of
the most long-lasting problems in low-frequency computational electromagnetics.
In this case, the effectiveness of the algorithm and its ease of implementation
may be even improved by introducing the novel concept of \textit{lazy
cohomology generators}.

temperature (5600 K - 6000 K) and slow rotation (rotational period > 10 days).
From the statistical analysis of these superflares, it was found that
superflares with energy 10^34 erg occur once in 800 years and superflares with
10^35 erg occur once in 5000 years on Sun-like stars. In this paper, we examine

and do not affect the probability of a new word to be used; and (ii) the
remaining virtually infinite number of noncore-words which have lower frequency
and once used reduce the probability of a new word to be used in the future.
Our model relies on a careful analysis of the google-ngram database of books
published in the last centuries and its main consequence is the generalization
of Zipf's and Heaps' law to two scaling regimes. We confirm that these
generalizations yield the best simple description of the data among generic
descriptive models and that the two free parameters depend only on the language
but not on the database. From the point of view of our model the main change on
historical time scales is the composition of the specific words included in the
finite list of core-words, which we observe to decay exponentially in time with
a rate of approximately 30 words per year for English.

kinematics of individual galaxies reveals that 58% of the galaxies are slow
rotators, which means that a high fraction of these galaxies should probably be
formed through major merger processes which might have produced gaseous thick

rotation. Computations on the major merger rate from close pairs indicate that
a typical star-forming galaxy underwent ~0.4 major mergers since ~9.5 Gyr,
showing that merging is a major process driving mass assembly into the red

than one galaxy over four is more metal-rich in its outskirts than in its

W-algebra symmetry, whose presence is powerful, but difficult to understand

representation theoretic arguments, and give, in particular, lattice versions

fermions at central charge c=-2, we provide a full analysis of the scaling

magnetohydrodynamical simulations of Pulsar Wind Nebulae. They show that the
kink instability and magnetic dissipation inside these nebulae may be the key
processes allowing to reconcile their observations with the theory of pulsar
winds. In particular, the size of the termination shock, obtained in the
simulations, agrees very well with the observations even for Poynting-dominated
pulsar winds. Due to magnetic dissipation the total pressure in the simulated
nebulae is particle-dominated and more or less uniform. While in the main body
of the simulated nebulae the magnetic field becomes rather randomized, close to
the termination shock, it is dominated by the regular toroidal field freshly
injected by the pulsar wind. This field is responsible for driving polar
outflows and may explain the high polarization observed in pulsar wind nebulae.

constraints can be considered as a collective entanglement effect, as in tube
model theories, or as certain pairwise uncrossability interactions, as in
slip-link models. A pairwise parameter, which varies between these limiting
cases, shows that, for the systems studied, the character of the entanglement
environment is more pairwise than collective.
  We employ a novel methodology, which analyzes entanglement constraints into a
complete set of pairwise interactions, similar to slip links. Entanglement
confinement is assembled by a plethora of links, with a spectrum of confinement
strengths, from strong to weak. The strength of interactions is quantified
through a link `persistence', which is the fraction of time for which the links
are active. By weighting links according to their strength, we show that
confinement is imposed mainly by the strong ones, and that the weak, trapped,
uncrossability interactions cannot contribute to the low frequency modulus of
an elastomer, or the plateau modulus of a melt.
  A self-consistent scheme for mapping topological constraints to specific,
strong binary links, according to a given entanglement density, is proposed and
validated. Our results demonstrate that slip links can be viewed as the
strongest pairwise interactions of a collective entanglement environment. The
methodology developed provides a basis for bridging the gap between atomistic

the discrete Helmholtz equation with Dirichlet, Neumann and Sommerfeld-like
boundary conditions based on a compact sixth order approximation scheme and
preconditioned Krylov subspace methodology. A sixth order compact scheme for
the 3D Helmholtz equation with different boundary conditions is developed to
reduce approximation and pollution errors, thereby softening the
point-per-wavelength constraint. The resulting systems of finite-difference
equations are solved by different preconditioned Krylov subspace-based methods.
In the majority of test problems, the preconditioned Generalized Minimal
Residual (GMRES) method is the superior choice, but in the case of sufficiently
fine grids a simple stationary two-level algorithm proposed in this paper in
combination with a lower order approximation preconditioner presents an
efficient alternative to the GMRES method. In the analysis of the lower order
preconditioning developed here, we introduce the term ""$k$-th order
preconditioned matrix"" in addition to the commonly used ""an optimal
preconditioner"". The necessity of the new criterion is justified by the fact
that the condition number of the preconditioned matrix $ AA^{-1}_p $ in some of
our test problems improves with the decrease of the grid step size. In a simple
1D case, we are able to prove this analytically. This new parameter could serve
as a guide in the construction of new preconditioners. The lower order direct
preconditioner used in our algorithms is based on a combination of the
separation of variables technique and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) type
methods. The resulting numerical methods allow efficient implementation on
parallel computers. Numerical results confirm the high efficiency of the
proposed iterative approach.

characterized by different values of the hopping for the two spin projections
of a fermion or equivalently, two different orbitals. This model is expected to
provide a good description of a mass-imbalanced cold fermionic mixture in a 3D
optical lattice. We use the dynamical mean field theory to study various
physical properties of this system. In particular, we show how
orbital-selective physics, observed in multi-orbital strongly correlated
electron systems, can be realized in such a simple model. We find that the
density distribution is a good probe of this orbital selective crossover from a
Fermi liquid to a non-Fermi liquid state.
  Below an ordering temperature $T_o$, which is a function of both the
interaction and hopping asymmetry, the system exhibits staggered long range
orbital order. Apart from the special case of the symmetric limit, i.e.,
Hubbard model, where there is no hopping asymmetry, this orbital order is
accompanied by a true charge density wave order for all values of the hopping
asymmetry. We calculate the order parameters and various physical quantities
including the thermodynamics in both the ordered and disordered phases. We find
that the formation of the charge density wave is signaled by an abrupt increase
in the sublattice double occupancies. Finally, we propose a new method,
entropic chromatography, for cooling fermionic atoms in optical lattices, by
exploiting the properties of the AHM. To establish this cooling strategy on a
firmer basis, we also discuss the variations in temperature induced by the
adiabatic tuning of interactions and hopping parameters.

different physical characteristics consistent with the difference in size
scales traced by our observations. Accounting for the distance of the W3 region

underlying difference in the structure of the two regions. Peak positions of
submillimetre and ammonia emission do not correlate strongly. Also, the extent
of diffuse emission is only moderately matched between ammonia and thermal
emission. Source sizes measured from our observations are consistent between
regions, although there is a noticeable difference between the submillimetre
source sizes with sources in Perseus being significantly smaller than those in
W3. Fractional abundances of ammonia are determined for our sources which
indicate a dip in the measured ammonia abundance at the positions of peak
submillimetre column density. Virial ratios are determined which show that our
sources are generally bound in both regions, although there is considerable
scatter in both samples. We conclude that sources in Perseus are bound on
smaller scales than in W3 in a way that may reflect their previous

study oscillations and concentrations in $\mathrm{L}^p$-bounded sequences of
functions. Decisively, MCFs retain information about the location, value
distribution, and direction of oscillations and concentrations, thus extending
at the same time the theories of (generalized) Young measures and H-measures.
In $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces oscillations and concentrations precisely discriminate
between weak and strong compactness, and thus MCFs allow to quantify the
difference in compactness. The definition of MCFs involves a Fourier variable,
whereby also differential constraints on the functions in the sequence can be
investigated easily - a distinct advantage over Young measure theory.
Furthermore, pointwise restrictions are reflected in the MCF as well, paving
the way for applications to Tartar's framework of compensated compactness;
consequently, we establish a new weak-to-strong compactness theorem in a
""geometric"" way. After developing several aspects of the abstract theory, we
consider three applications: For lamination microstructures, the hierarchy of
oscillations is reflected in the MCF. The directional information retained in
an MCF is harnessed in the relaxation theory for anisotropic integral
functionals. Finally, we indicate how the theory pertains to the study of
propagation of singularities in certain systems of PDEs. The proofs combine
measure theory, Young measures, and harmonic analysis.

developed using a perturbative approach in the limit of small libration

at leading order an azimuthal flow which scales as the square of the libration
amplitude and only depends on the cylindrical-radius coordinate. The mean flow
also exhibits a discontinuity across the cylinder tangent to the inner sphere.
We show that this discontinuity can be smoothed through multi-scale Stewartson

To appear in Geometry Groups and Dynamics",,,,"math.GR math.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study automorphisms of a relatively hyperbolic group G. When G is
one-ended, we describe Out(G) using a preferred JSJ tree over subgroups that
are virtually cyclic or parabolic. In particular, when G is toral relatively
hyperbolic, Out(G) is virtually built out of mapping class groups and subgroups
of GL_n(Z) fixing certain basis elements. When more general parabolic groups
are allowed, these subgroups of GL_n(Z) have to be replaced by McCool groups:
automorphisms of parabolic groups acting trivially (i.e. by conjugation) on
certain subgroups. Given a malnormal quasiconvex subgroup P of a hyperbolic
group G, we view G as hyperbolic relative to P and we apply the previous
analysis to describe the group Out(P to G) of automorphisms of P that extend to
G: it is virtually a McCool group. If Out(P to G) is infinite, then P is a
vertex group in a splitting of G. If P is torsion-free, then Out(P to G) is of
type VF, in particular finitely presented. We also determine when Out(G) is
infinite, for G relatively hyperbolic. The interesting case is when G is
infinitely-ended and has torsion. When G is hyperbolic, we show that Out(G) is
infinite if and only if G splits over a maximal virtually cyclic subgroup with
infinite center. In general we show that infiniteness of Out(G) comes from the
existence of a splitting with infinitely many twists, or having a vertex group
that is maximal parabolic with infinitely many automorphisms acting trivially
on incident edge groups.

degree distribution $P(k)\sim k^{-\lambda}$, where $k$ is the degree of a node.
It is known that the fluctuations of the SRM model above the critical dimension
($d_c=2$) scales logarithmically with $N$ on euclidean lattices. However,
Pastore y Piontti {\it et. al.} [A. L. Pastore y Piontti {\it et. al.}, Phys.

for $\lambda \geq 3$. In this letter we found that for a pure ballistic
deposition model on SF networks $W_S$ scales as a power law with an exponent
that depends on $\lambda$. On the other hand when both processes are in
competition, we find that there is a continuous crossover between a SRM
behavior and a power law behavior due to the BD model that depends on the
occurrence probability of each process and the system size. Interestingly, we
find that a relaxation process contaminated by any small contribution of
ballistic deposition will behave, for increasing system sizes, as a pure
ballistic one. Our findings could be relevant when surface relaxation
mechanisms are used to synchronize processes that evolve on top of complex

medium of our own Galaxy, and they are ubiquitously observed in diffuse gas in
the halos of galaxies and galaxy clusters. Yet, magnetic fields have typically
been neglected in studies of the formation of galaxies, leaving their global
influence on galaxy formation largely unclear. We extend our MHD implementation
in the moving-mesh code Arepo to cosmological problems which include radiative
cooling and the formation of stars. In particular, we replace our previously
employed divergence cleaning approach with a Powell 8-wave scheme, which turns
out to be significantly more stable, even in very dynamic environments. We
verify the improved accuracy through simulations of the MRI in accretion disks,
that reproduce its correct linear growth rate. Using this new MHD code, we
simulate the formation of isolated disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way using
idealized initial conditions with and without magnetic fields. We find that the
magnetic field is quickly amplified in the initial starburst and the
differential rotation of the forming disk until it eventually saturates when it
becomes comparable to the thermal pressure. The additional pressure component
leads to a lower star formation rate at late times compared to simulations
without magnetic fields, and induces changes in the spiral arm structures of
the gas disk. In addition, we observe highly magnetized fountain-like outflows
from the disk. These results are robust with numerical resolution and are
largely independent of the initial magnetic seed field assumed in the initial
conditions, as the amplification process is rapid and self-regulated. Our
findings suggest an important influence of magnetic fields on galaxy formation

heat release than is accounted for in current models. Obtaining firm

therefore its origin remains uncertain. We report on Swift and XMM-Newton
observations of the transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary XTE J1709-267,
which were made in 2012 September-October when it transitioned to quiescence
after a ~10-week long accretion outburst. The source is detected with
XMM-Newton at a 0.5-10 keV luminosity of Lx~2E34 (D/8.5 kpc)^2 erg/s. The X-ray
spectrum consists of a thermal component that fits to a neutron star atmosphere
model and a non-thermal emission tail, which each contribute ~50% to the total
emission. The neutron star temperature decreases from ~158 to ~152 eV during
the ~8-hour long observation. This can be interpreted as cooling of a crustal
layer located at a column density of y~5E12 g/cm^2 (~50 m inside the neutron
star), which is just below the ignition depth of superbursts. The required heat
generation in the layers on top would be ~0.06-0.13 MeV per accreted nucleon.
The magnitude and depth rule out electron captures and nuclear fusion reactions
as the heat source, but it may be accounted for by chemical separation of light
and heavy nuclei. Low-level accretion offers an alternative explanation for the
observed variability.

flow and the angular momentum of collapsing halos is induced by tidal torques.
The growth of halo angular momentum in the linear and quasi-linear phases is
associated with a shear, curl-free, flow and it is well described within the
linear framework of tidal torque theory (TTT). However, TTT is rendered
irrelevant as haloes approach turn around and virialization. At that stage the
flow field around halos has non-zero vorticity. Using a cosmological
simulation, we have examined the importance of the curl of the velocity field
(vorticity) in determining halo spin, finding a strong alignment between the
two. We have also examined the alignment of vorticity with the principle axes
of the shear tensor, finding that it tends to be perpendicular to the axis
along which material is collapsing fastest (e1). This behavior is independent
of halo masses and cosmic web environment. Our results agree with previous
findings on the tendency of halo spin to be perpendicular to e1, and of the
spin of (simulated) halos and (observed) galaxies to be aligned with the
large-scale structure. Our results imply that angular momentum growth proceeds
in two distinct phases. In the first phase angular momentum emerges out of a
shear, curl-free, potential flow, as described by TTT. In the second phase, in
which haloes approach virialization, the angular momentum emerges out of a
vortical flow and halo spin becomes strongly aligned with the vorticity of the
ambient flow field.

the mass/velocity anisotropy (VA) degeneracy inherent in the Jeans equation, as
well as the lack of techniques that are both fast and adaptable to realistic
systems. A new fast method, called MAMPOSSt, which performs a maximum
likelihood fit of the distribution of observed tracers in projected phase
space, is developed and thoroughly tested. MAMPOSSt assumes a shape for the
gravitational potential, but instead of postulating a shape for the
distribution function in terms of energy and angular momentum, or supposing
Gaussian line-of-sight velocity distributions, MAMPOSSt assumes a VA profile
and a shape for the 3D velocity distribution, here Gaussian. MAMPOSSt requires
no binning, differentiation, nor extrapolation of the observables. Tests on
cluster-mass haloes from LambdaCDM cosmological simulations show that, with 500
tracers, MAMPOSSt is able to jointly recover the virial radius, tracer scale
radius, dark matter scale radius and outer or constant VA with small bias (<10%
on scale radii and <2% on the two other quantities) and inefficiencies of 10%,
27%, 48% and 20%, respectively. MAMPOSSt does not perform better when some
parameters are frozen, and even worse when the virial radius is set to its true
value, which appears to be the consequence of halo triaxiality. The accuracy of
MAMPOSSt depends weakly on the adopted interloper removal scheme, including an
efficient iterative Bayesian scheme that we introduce here, which can directly
obtain the virial radius with as good precision as MAMPOSSt. Our tests show
that MAMPOSSt with Gaussian 3D velocities is very competitive with, and up to
1000x faster than other methods. Hence, MAMPOSSt is a very powerful and rapid
tool for the mass and anisotropy modeling of systems such as clusters and
groups of galaxies, elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

off as 1/R. We use published data on a sample of 20 well studied galaxies to
show that ISM disks do maintain a constant Q over radii usually encompassing

This implies that the ISM disk is responding to the potential, and hence that
secular evolution is important for setting the structure of ISM disks. We show
that the gas to total mass ratio should be anti-correlated with the maximum
rotational velocity, and that the sample falls on the expected relationship. A
very steep fall off in Sigma_g is required at the outermost radii to keep the
mass and angular momentum content finite for typical rotation curve shapes, and
is observed. The observation that HI traces dark matter over a significant
range of radii in galaxies is thus due to the disks stabilising themselves in a
normal dark matter dominated potential. This explanation is consistent with the
cold dark matter paradigm.

medium of a massive star cluster following the initial burst of star formation.
We argue that accretion onto stellar-mass black holes (BHs) is an effective
mechanism for rapid gas depletion in clusters of all masses, as long as they
contain progenitor stars more massive than \gtrsim 50\msun. This scenario is
attractive for the progenitor systems of present-day massive globular clusters
(GCs) which likely had masses M \gtrsim 10^7\msun. In such clusters, supernovae
and stellar winds cannot provide a plausible explanation for the sudden removal
of the primordial gas reservoir that is required to explain their complex
chemical enrichment history.
  In order to consider different regimes in the gas accretion rate onto
stellar-mass BHs, we consider both the Bondi-Hoyle and Eddington
approximations. For either model, our results show that the gas can be
significantly depleted within only a few tens of Myrs. This process will affect
the distribution of BH masses, and may accelerate the dynamical decoupling of
the BH population and, ultimately, their dynamical ejection. Moreover, the
timescales for gas depletion are sufficiently short that the accreting BHs
could significantly affect the chemistry of subsequent star formation episodes.
  The gas depletion times and final mass in BHs are sensitive to the assumed
model for the accretion rate, and to the initial mass of the most massive BH
which, in turn, is determined by the upper mass cut-off of the stellar IMF. Our
results imply that the remnant accretion history can have an important bearing
on the observed present-day cluster mass-to-light ratio. In particular, we show
that an increase of the upper mass cut-off with decreasing metallicity could
contribute to the observed anti-correlation between the mass-to-light ratio and
the metallicity of GCs.

High relative velocities of planetesimals preclude their growth in mutual

excitation, lowering planetesimal velocities by an order of magnitude or even
more at 1 AU. By examining the details of planetesimal dynamics we demonstrate

the last 12 Myrs, and consequently the galaxy has a relatively high SN rate at
present. Thus, SNe are more important gas sources than AGB stars in the SMC.
The total gas input from stellar sources into the ISM is 2-4x10^-2 Msun yr-1.
This is slightly smaller than the ISM gas consumed by starformation (~8x10^-2
Msun yr-1). Starformation in the SMC relies on a gas reservoir in the ISM, but
eventually the starformation rate will decline in this galaxy, unless gas
infalls into the ISM from an external source. The dust injection rate from AGB
and RSG candidates is 1x10^-5 Msun yr-1. Dust injection from SNe is in the
range of 0.2--11x10^-4 Msun yr-1, although the SN contribution is rather
uncertain. Stellar sources could be important for ISM dust (3x10^5 Msun yr-1)
in the SMC, if the dust lifetime is about 1.4 Gyrs. We found that the presence
of poly-aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ISM cannot be explained entirely by
carbon-rich AGB stars. Carbon-rich AGB stars could inject only 7x10^-9 Msun
yr-1 of PAHs at most, which could contribute up to 100 Msun of PAHs in the
lifetime of a PAH. The estimated PAH mass of 1800 Msun in the SMC can not be
explained. Additional PAH sources, or ISM reprocessing should be needed.

other desirable properties are identified as a result of the chosen node

when the mqr-tree is used to index point data. A comparison of the mqr-tree

by superradiance, which induces exponentially-growing instabilities (the `black

the bosonic field has rest mass. Here we present a time-domain study of the
scalar field on Kerr spacetime which probes ultra-long timescales up to $t
\lesssim 5 \times 10^6 M$, to reveal the growth of the instability. We describe
an highly-efficient method for evolving the field, based on a spectral
decomposition into a coupled set of 1+1D equations, and an absorbing boundary
condition inspired by the `perfectly-matched layers' paradigm. First, we
examine the mirror case to study how the instability timescale and mode
structure depend on mirror radius. Next, we examine the massive-field, whose
rich spectrum (revealed through Fourier analysis) generates `beating' effects
which disguise the instability. We show that the instability is clearly
revealed by tracking the stress-energy of the field in the exterior spacetime.
We calculate the growth rate for a range of mass couplings, by applying a
frequency-filer to isolate individual modal contributions to the time-domain
signal. Our results are in accord with previous frequency-domain studies which
put the maximum growth rate at $\tau^{-1} \approx 1.72 \times 10^{-7}

likelihood is difficult or impossible to calculate, are an active topic of
current research. Most current ABC algorithms directly approximate the
posterior distribution, but an alternative, less common strategy is to
approximate the likelihood function. This has several advantages. First, in
some problems, it is easier to approximate the likelihood than to approximate
the posterior. Second, an approximation to the likelihood allows reference
analyses to be constructed based solely on the likelihood. Third, it is
straightforward to perform sensitivity analyses for several different choices
of prior once an approximation to the likelihood is constructed, which needs to
be done only once. The contribution of the present paper is to consider
regression density estimation techniques to approximate the likelihood in the
ABC setting. Our likelihood approximations build on recently developed marginal
adaptation density estimators by extending them for conditional density
estimation. Our approach facilitates reference Bayesian inference, as well as
frequentist inference. The method is demonstrated via a challenging problem of

estimated the black hole mass using the corresponding $M_{BH} - {\sigma*}$

factor of 3. This result would support that $M_{BH}$ and $M_{BH}^{\sigma*}$ are
the same for intermediate-type AGN as has been found for type 1 AGN. However,
when the type of the bulge is taken into account only 3 out of the 7

subjected to a classical colored noise, i.e. coupled with an external
environment characterized by a noise spectrum of the form $1/f^{\alpha}$. More
specifically, we address systems where the Gaussian approximation fails, i.e.
the sole knowledge of the spectrum is not enough to determine the dynamics of
quantum correlations. We thus investigate the dynamics for two different
configurations of the environment: in the first case the noise spectrum is due
to the interaction of each qubit with a single bistable fluctuator with an
undetermined switching rate, whereas in the second case we consider a
collection of classical fluctuators with fixed switching rates. In both cases
we found analytical expressions for the time dependence of entanglement and
quantum discord, which may be also extended to a collection of flcutuators with
random switching rates. The environmental noise is introduced by means of
stochastic time-dependent terms in the Hamiltonian and this allows us to
describe the effects of both separate and common environments. We show that the
non-Gaussian character of the noise may lead to significant effects, e.g.
environments with the same power spectrum, but different configurations, give
raise to opposite behavior for the quantum correlations. In particular,
depending on the characteristics of the environmental noise considered, both
entanglement and discord display either a monotonic decay or the phenomena of
sudden death and revivals. Our results show that the microscopic structure of

the forward-shock emission from a collimated outflow model that can account for
both the pre- and post-break flux power-law decay indices, given the measured
X-ray spectral slope. If allowance is made for a steady energy injection into
the forward-shock, then another 56 percent of X-ray afterglows have a
light-curve break that can be explained with a jet-break. The remaining 12
percent that are not jet-breaks, as well as the existence of two breaks in 19
afterglows (out of which only one can be a jet-break), suggest that some X-ray
breaks arise from a sudden change in the rate at which energy is added to the
blast-wave, and it may well be that a larger fraction of X-ray light-curve
breaks are generated by that mechanism. To test the above two mechanisms for
afterglow light-curve breaks, we derive comprehensive analytical results for
the dynamics of outflows undergoing energy injection and for their
light-curves, including closure relations for inverse-Compton afterglows and
for the emission from spreading jets interacting with an wind-like ambient
medium.

fresh products of stellar nucleosynthesis ejected by one or several massive

ENZ properties, under oblique, TM-polarized plane wave incidence. We then
introduce active gain material in engineered metamaterial slabs that adds
peculiar spectral and angular features to transmission, reflection, and
absorption properties, and leads to a further local field enhancement. These
findings are supported by two theoretical studies: First, a simple interface
between two semi-infinite media, namely free space and a generic ENZ medium;
then, an ENZ slab of finite thickness, with the aim of understanding the
system's behavior when varying the ENZ properties as well as the incident
angle. For either case we report three distinct physical conditions for which
we explain spectral and angular features that might result in strong field

time is roughly constant when the source is ""on"", but falls below the detection
limit as the wind collision region approaches periastron in its orbit around
the contact binary at the center of the system. In addition, at one of the ""on""
epochs, the flux drops to about a fifth of its average value. We suggest that
this apparent variation could result from the inhomogeneity of the wind that
hides part of the flux rather than from an intrinsic variation. We measured a
trigonometrical parallax, for the most compact radio emission of 0.61 $\pm$
0.22 mas, corresponding to a distance of 1.65 $^{+0.96}_{-0.44}$ kpc, in
agreement with recent trigonometrical parallaxes measured for objects in the
Cygnus X complex. Using constraints on the total mass of the system and orbital
parameters previously reported in the literature, we obtain two independent
indirect measurements of the distance to the Cyg OB2 #5 system, both consistent
with 1.3--1.4 kpc. Finally, we suggest that the companion star responsible for

energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is degraded by multiple scattering events in
thick layers. Here, we explore the limits of EELS for studying chemical
reactions in their native environments in real time and on the nanometer scale.
The determination of the local electron density, optical gap and thickness of

experimental plasmon energies, we find that liquids appear to follow the
free-electron model that has been previously established for solids. Signals at
energies below the optical gap and plasmon energy of the liquid provide a high
signal-to-background ratio regime as demonstrated for LiFePO4 in aqueous

NMR diffusion acquisitions seemed impossible, because the necessary phase

the measurement technique which we have recently proposed theoretically that
the shape of arbitrary closed pores can be imaged by diffusion acquisitions,
which yield the phase information. For this purpose, we use hyperpolarized
xenon gas in well-defined geometries. The signal can be collected from the
whole sample which mainly eliminates the problem of vanishing signal at
increasing resolution of conventional NMR imaging. This could be used to
non-invasively gain structural information inaccessible so far such as pore or

between 1.0 and 3.0 $M_{\odot}$ and a resolution $\delta M \leq 0.02$
$M_{\odot}$, which can be used to study the effects of rotation on stellar
evolutions and on the characteristics of star clusters. The value of $\sim$2.05
$M_{\odot}$ is a critical mass for the effects of rotation on stellar structure
and evolution. For stars with $M >$ 2.05 $M_{\odot}$, rotation leads to an
increase in the convective core and prolongs the lifetime of main sequence
(MS); rotating models evolve slower than non-rotating ones; the effects of
rotation on the evolution of these stars are similar to those of convective
core overshooting. However for stars with 1.1 $< M/M_{\odot}<$ 2.05, rotation
results in a decrease in the convective core and shortens the lifetime of MS;
rotating models evolve faster than non-rotating ones. When the mass is located
in the range of $\sim$1.7 - 2.0 $M_{\odot}$, the mixing caused by rotationally
induced instabilities is not efficient; the hydrostatic effects dominate the
effect on the evolution of these stars. For the models with masses between
about 1.6 and 2.0 $M_{\odot}$, rotating models always exhibit lower effective
temperatures than non-rotating ones at the same age during the MS stage. For a
given age, the lower the mass, the smaller the change in the effective
temperature. Thus rotations could lead to a color spread near the MS turnoff in
the color-magnitude diagram for the intermediate-age star clusters.

thermodynamic potential of the HER is applied. Large overpotentials are
energetically inefficient but can be lowered with expensive platinum based
catalysts. Replacement of Pt with inexpensive, earth abundant electrocatalysts
would be significantly beneficial for clean and efficient hydrogen evolution.
Towards this end, promising HER characteristics have been reported using 2H
(trigonal prismatic) XS2 (where X = Mo or W) nanoparticles with a high
concentration of metallic edges as electrocatalysts. The key challenges for HER
with XS2 are increasing the number and catalytic activity of active sites. Here
we report atomically thin nanosheets of chemically exfoliated WS2 as efficient
catalysts for hydrogen evolution with very low overpotentials.
Atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy analyses
indicate that enhanced electrocatalytic activity of WS2 is associated with high
concentration of strained metallic 1T (octahedral) phase in the as-exfoliated
nanosheets. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the presence of
strain in the 1T phase leads to an enhancement of the density of states at the
Fermi level and increases the catalytic activity of the WS2 nanosheet. Our
results suggest that chemically exfoliated WS2 nanosheets could be interesting

V1504 Cyg, which extends for a period of about 630 d. All superoutbursts in
V1504 Cyg have turned out to be of the precursor-main type and the superhump
first appears near the maximum of the precursor. The superhumps grow smoothly
from the precursor to the main superoutburst showing that the superoutburst is
initiated by the tidal instability (as evidenced by growing superhump) as
envisioned in the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model proposed by Osaki
(1989). We have performed power spectral analysis of the light curve of V1504
Cyg. One of outstanding features is an appearance of a negative superhump
extending for around 300 d, well over a supercycle. We have found that an
appearance of the negative superhump tends to reduce the frequency of
occurrence of normal outbursts. Two types of supercycles are recognized in
V1504 Cyg, which are similar to those of the Type L and S supercycles in the
light curve of VW Hyi, a prototype SU UMa star, introduced by Smak (1985). It
is found that the Type L supercycle is the one accompanied with the negative
superhump and the Type S is that without the negative superhump. If we adopt a
tilted disk as an origin of the negative superhump, two types of the
supercycles are understood to be due to a difference in outburst intervals,
which is in turn caused by a difference in mass supply from the secondary to
different parts of the disk. The frequency of the negative superhump varies
systematically during a supercycle in V1504 Cyg. This variation can be used as
an indicator of the disk radius variation and we have found that observed disk
radius variation in V1504 Cyg fits very well with a prediction of the TTI
model.

constituent. This number of observations, which we call the {\em ""sampling
aperture""}, is a crucial parameter of the problem. We obtain the {\em first}
bounds for this mixture-learning problem {\em without imposing any assumptions
on the mixture constituents.} We show that efficient learning is possible
exactly at the information-theoretically least-possible aperture of $2k-1$.
Thus, we achieve near-optimal dependence on $n$ and optimal aperture. While the
sample-size required by our algorithm depends exponentially on $k$, we prove
that such a dependence is {\em unavoidable} when one considers general
mixtures. A sequence of tools contribute to the algorithm, such as
concentration results for random matrices, dimension reduction, moment
estimations, and sensitivity analysis.

optical to the near- and far-infrared were employed. The surface density
distribution of all the 2MASS sources with certain detection toward IC 1396
indicates the existence of a compact cluster spatially consistent with the
position of the exciting source of the H II region, HD 206267. The spatial
distribution of the infrared excessive emission sources selected based on
archived 2MASS data reveals the existence of four sub-clusters in this region.
One is in association with the open cluster Trumpler 37. The other three are
found to be spatially coincident with the bright rims of the H II region. All
the excessive emission sources in the near infrared are cross-identified with
the AKARI IRC data, an analysis of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of
the resultant sample leads to the identification of 8 CLASS I, 15 CLASS II and
15 CLASS III sources in IC 1396. Optical identification of the sample sources
with R magnitudes brighter than 17 mag corroborates the results from the SED
analysis. Based on the spatial distribution of the infrared young stellar
objects at different evolutionary stages, the surrounding sub-clusters located
in the bright rims are believed to be younger than the central one. This is
consistent with a scenario of sequential star formation in this region. Imaging
data of a dark patch in IC 1396 by Herschel SPIRE, on the other hand, indicate
the presence of two far-infrared cores in LDN 1111, which are likely new
generation protostellar objects in formation. So we infer that the star
formation process in this H II region was not continuous but episodic.

degenerate biological system. Degeneracies in physical and biological systems
can be lifted by external perturbations thus allowing degenerate systems to
exhibit a wide range of behaviors. Here we show that the degeneracy of the
genetic code is lifted by environmental perturbations to regulate protein
levels in living cells. By measuring protein synthesis rates from a synthetic
reporter library in Escherichia coli, we find that environmental perturbations,
such as reduction of cognate amino acid supply, lift the degeneracy of the
genetic code by splitting codon families into a hierarchy of robust and
sensitive synonymous codons. Rates of protein synthesis associated with robust
codons are up to hundred-fold higher than those associated with sensitive
codons under these conditions. We find that the observed hierarchy between
synonymous codons is not determined by usual rules associated with tRNA
abundance and codon usage. Rather, competition among tRNA isoacceptors for
aminoacylation underlies the robustness of protein synthesis. Remarkably, the
hierarchy established using the synthetic library also explains the measured
robustness of synthesis for endogenous proteins in E. coli. We further found
that the same hierarchy is reflected in the fitness cost of synonymous
mutations in amino acid biosynthesis genes and in the transcriptional control
of sigma factor genes. Our study reveals that the degeneracy of the genetic
code can be lifted by environmental perturbations, and it suggests that
organisms can exploit degeneracy lifting as a general strategy to adapt protein
synthesis to their environment.

did it form via mergers, as expected from Lambda CDM theory, or from disk
instabilities, as suggested by its boxy/peanut shape, or both? We have obtained
spectra for 28,000 stars at a spectral resolution of R = 11,000. From these
spectra, we have determined stellar parameters and distances to an accuracy of
< 1.5 kpc. The stars in the inner Galaxy span a large range in [Fe/H], -2.8 <
[Fe/H] < +0.6. From the spatial distribution of the red clump stars as a
function of [Fe/H] (Ness et al. 2012a), we propose that the stars with [Fe/H] >
-0.5 are part of the boxy/peanut bar/bulge. We associate the lower metallicity
stars ([Fe/H] < -0.5) with the thick disk, which may be puffed up in the inner
region, and with the inner regions of the metal-weak thick disk and inner halo.
For the bulge stars with [Fe/H] > -0.5, we find two discrete populations; (i)
stars with [Fe/H] ~ -0.25 which provide a roughly constant fraction of the
stars in the latitude interval b = -5 deg to -10 deg, and (ii) a kinematically
colder, more metal-rich population with mean [Fe/H] ~ +0.15 which is more
prominent closer to the plane. The changing ratio of these components with
latitude appears as a vertical abundance gradient of the bulge. We attribute
both of these bulge components to instability-driven bar/bulge formation from
the thin disk. We do not exclude a weak underlying classical merger-generated
bulge component, but see no obvious kinematic association of any of our bulge
stars with such a classical bulge component. [abridged]

is used to capture the dynamics of crystals precipitating from a

growth phenomena in veins, we investigate the influence of various boundary
conditions on crystal growth. In particular, we analyze the formation of vein
microstructures resulting from the free growth of crystals as well as
crack-sealing processes. We define the crystal symmetry by considering the
anisotropy in surface energy to simulate crystals with flat facets and sharp
corners. The resulting growth competition of crystals with different
orientations is studied to deduce a consistent orientation selection rule in
the free-growth regime. Using crack-sealing simulations, we correlate the grain
boundary tracking behavior depending on the relative rate of crack opening,
opening trajectory, initial grain size and wall roughness. Further, we
illustrate how these parameters induce the microstructural transition between
blocky (crystals growing anisotropically) to fibrous morphology (isotropic) and
formation of grain boundaries. The phase-field simulations of crystals in the
free-growth regime (in 2D and 3D) indicate that the growth or consumption of a
crystal is dependent on the orientation difference with neighboring crystals.
The crack-sealing simulation results (in 2D and 3D) reveal that crystals grow
isotropically and grain boundaries track the opening trajectory if the wall
roughness is high, opening increments are small and crystals touch the wall
before the next crack increment starts. Further, we find that within the
complete crack-seal regime, anisotropy in surface energy results in the
formation of curved/oscillating grain boundaries (instead of straight) when the
crack opening velocity is increased and wall roughness is not sufficiently
high.

Recently, a Fermi gamma-ray source (2FGL J2030.7+4417) with a position
compatible with that of HD 195592 has been reported. Our goal is to explore the
scenario where HD 195592 is the counterpart of the Fermi gamma-ray source
modeling the non-thermal emission produced in the bowshock of the runaway star.
We calculate the spectral energy distribution of the radiation produced in the
bowshock of HD 195592 and we compare it with Fermi observations of 2FGL
J2030.7+4417. We present relativistic particle losses and the resulting
radiation of the bowshock of HD 195592 and show that the latter is compatible
with the detected gamma-ray emission. We conclude that the Fermi source 2FGL
J2030.7+4417 might be produced, under some energetic assumptions, by inverse
Compton up-scattering of photons from the heated dust in the bowshock of the
runaway star. HD 195592 might therefore be the very first object detected

derived reveal two major results. On the one hand, a slow modulation of the
X-ray flux (with a relative amplitude of up to 15% over 16h in the 0.3--4.0keV
band) is detected. Its characteristic timescale cannot be determined with
precision, but amounts from one to several days. It could be related to
corotating interaction regions, known to exist in zeta Pup from UV
observations. Hour-long changes, linked to flares or to the pulsation activity,
are not observed in the last decade covered by the XMM observations; the 17h
tentative period, previously reported in a ROSAT analysis, is not confirmed
either and is thus transient, at best. On the other hand, short-term changes
are surprisingly small (<1% relative amplitude for the total energy band). In
fact, they are compatible solely with the presence of Poisson noise in the
data. This surprisingly low level of short-term variability, in view of the
embedded wind-shock origin, requires a very high fragmentation of the stellar
wind, for both absorbing and emitting features (>10^5 parcels, comparing with a
2D wind model). This is the first time that constraints have been placed on the

architecture of the systems by exciting the eccentricity and causing dynamical
instability. Since, incidentally, the timescale over which a cluster loses its
gaseous component and begins to disperse is comparable to the circumstellar
disk lifetime, we expect that closer, and more perturbing, stellar flybys occur
when the planets are still embedded in their birth disk. We investigate the
effects of the disk on the dynamics of planets after the stellar encounter to
test whether it can damp the eccentricity and return the planetary system to a
non-excited state. We use the hydrodynamical code FARGO to study the
disk+planet(s) system during and after the stellar encounter in the context of
evolved disk models whose superficial density is 10 times lower than that of
the Minimum Mass Solar Nebula. The numerical simulations show that the planet
eccentricity, excited during a close stellar flyby, is damped on a short
timescale (~ 10 Kyr) in spite of the disk low initial density and subsequent
tidal truncation. This damping is effective also for a system of 3 giant
planets and the effects of the dynamical instability induced by the passing
star are quickly absorbed. If the circumstellar disk is still present around
the star during a stellar flyby, a planet (or a planetary system) is returned
to a non-excited state on a short timescale. This does not mean that stellar
encounters do not affect the evolution of planets, but they do it in a subtle
way with a short period of agitated dynamical evolution. At the end of it, the
system resumes a quiet evolution and the planetary orbits are circularized by
the interaction with the disk.

arbitrary boundaries in two dimensions, to best of our knowledge the

prescription, we have expanded the arbitrary boundary in terms of spherical

solutions at each order for the problem in terms of corrections to the
equivalent spherical boundary for both the boundary conditions. This
formulation is in parallel with the standard time-independent
Rayleigh-Schr{\""o}dinger perturbation theory. The efficiency of the method is
tested by comparing the perturbative values against the numerically calculated

tracers. Using SINFONI observations, we create linemaps of Br\gamma,
[FeII]_{1.64}, and all detected H_2 transitions. By using symmetry arguments of
the gas and stellar gas velocity field, we find a kinematic center in agreement
with previous determinations. The ratio of the 2-1 S(1) to 1-0 S(1) H_2
transitions can be used as a diagnostic to discriminate between shock and
fluorescent excitation. Using the 1-0 S(1)/2-1 S(1) line ratio as well as
several other H_2 line ratios and the morphological comparison between H_2 and
Br\gamma and [FeII], we find that excitation from UV photons is the dominant
excitation mechanisms throughout NGC 253. We employ a diagnostic energy level
diagram to quantitatively differentiate between mechanisms. We compare the
observed energy level diagrams to PDR and shock models and find that in most
regions and over the galaxy as a whole, fluorescent excitation is the dominant
mechanism exciting the H_2 gas. We also place an upper limit of the percentage
of shock excited H_2 at 29%. We find that UV radiation is the dominant
excitation mechanism for the H_2 emission. The H_2 emission does not correlate
well with Br\gamma but closely traces the PAH emission, showing that not only
is H_2 fluorescently excited, but it is predominately excited by slightly lower
mass stars than O stars which excite Br\gamma, such as B stars.

results concerning the dynamics of vortices in incompressible planar flows. The
first one is an asymptotic expansion, in the vanishing viscosity limit, of the
solution of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with point vortices as
initial data. In such a situation, it is known (Gallay, 2011) that the solution
behaves to leading order like a linear superposition of Oseen vortices whose
centers evolve according to the point vortex system, but higher order
corrections can also be computed which describe the deformation of the vortex
cores due to mutual interactions. The second result is the construction by D.
Smets and J. van Schaftingen of ""desingularized"" solutions of the
two-dimensional Euler equation. These solutions are stationary in a uniformly
rotating or translating frame, and converge either to a single vortex or to a
vortex pair as the size parameter $\epsilon$ goes to zero. We consider here the
particular case of a pair of identical vortices, and we show that the solution
of the weakly viscous Navier-Stokes equation is accurately described at time
$t$ by an approximate steady state of the rotating Euler equation which is a
desingularized solution in the sense of Smets and van Schaftingen, with
Gaussian profile and size $\epsilon = \sqrt{\nu t}$.

subsequent scattering processes, the non-Abelian version of the

slightly increasing the parameter u. Our results differ from previous ones in
that we allow the mutual distance between the sets A_1 and A_2 to be much

decoupling for which such flexibility is crucial. More precisely, we prove
that, above a certain critical threshold u**, the probability of having long

associated to the Fermi-LAT source 1FGLJ1227.9-4852/2FGLJ1227.7-4853.
Multi-wavelength observations have added information on this source, indicating
a low-luminosity low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB), but its nature is still unclear.
To progress in our understanding, we present new X-ray data from a monitoring
campaign performed in 2011 with the XMM-Newton, RXTE, and Swift satellites and
combine them with new gamma-ray data from the Fermi and AGILE satellites. We
complement the study with simultaneous near-UV photometry from XMM-Newton and
with previous UV/optical and near-IR data. The X-ray history of XSSJ1227.0-4859
over 7yr shows a persistent and rather stable low-luminosity (~6x10^33
d_{1\,kpc}^2 erg/s) source, with flares and dips being peculiar and permanent
characteristics. The associated Fermi-LAT source 2FGLJ1227.7-4853 is also
stable over an overlapping period of 4.7\,yr. Searches for X-ray fast
pulsations down to msec give upper limits to pulse fractional amplitudes of
15-25% that do not rule out a fast spinning pulsar. The combined
UV/optical/near-IR spectrum reveals a hot component at ~13\,kK and a cool one
at ~4.6\,kK. The latter would suggest a late-type K2-K5 companion star, a
distance range of1.4--3.6kpc and an orbital period of 7--9 h. A near-UV
variability (>6\,h) also suggests a longer orbital period than previously
estimated. The analysis shows that the X-ray and UV/optical/near-IR emissions
are more compatible with an accretion-powered compact object than with a
rotational powered pulsar. The X-ray to UV bolometric luminosity ratio could be
consistent with a binary hosting a neutron star, but the uncertainties in the
radio data may also allow an LMXB black hole with a compact jet. In this case
it would be the first associated with a high-energy gamma-ray source.

capture the similarity of polygonal curves. Unfortunately, it exhibits a high
sensitivity to the presence of outliers. Since the presence of outliers is a
frequently occurring phenomenon in practice, a robust variant of Fr\'{e}chet
distance is required which absorbs outliers. We study such a variant here. In
this modified variant, our objective is to minimize the length of subcurves of
two polygonal curves that need to be ignored (MinEx problem), or alternately,
maximize the length of subcurves that are preserved (MaxIn problem), to achieve
a given Fr\'{e}chet distance. An exact solution to one problem would imply an
exact solution to the other problem. However, we show that these problems are
not solvable by radicals over $\mathbb{Q}$ and that the degree of the
polynomial equations involved is unbounded in general. This motivates the
search for approximate solutions. We present an algorithm, which approximates,
for a given input parameter $\delta$, optimal solutions for the \MinEx\ and
\MaxIn\ problems up to an additive approximation error $\delta$ times the
length of the input curves. The resulting running time is upper bounded by
$\mathcal{O} \left(\frac{n^3}{\delta} \log \left(\frac{n}{\delta}

have shown that a high Jeans resolution is needed to resolve turbulent

cells per Jeans length. The presence of the dynamo can be clearly confirmed for
resolutions of at least 64 cells per Jeans length, while saturation occurs at
approximate equipartition with turbulent energy. As a result of the large
Reynolds numbers in primordial galaxies, we expect saturation to occur at early

  Aerodynamic Forces","7 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper participates in the development of a unified approach to the
control of aerial vehicles with extended flight envelopes. More precisely,
modeling for control purposes of a class of thrust-propelled aerial vehicles
subjected to lift and drag aerodynamic forces is addressed assuming a
rotational symmetry of the vehicle's shape about the thrust force axis. A
condition upon aerodynamic characteristics that allows one to recast the
control problem into the simpler case of a spherical vehicle is pointed out.
Beside showing how to adapt nonlinear controllers developed for this latter
case, the paper extends a previous work by the authors in two directions.
First, the 3D case is addressed whereas only motions in a single vertical plane
was considered. Secondly, the family of models of aerodynamic forces for which
the aforementioned transformation holds is enlarged.

its structure of Poisson_0-algebra, is independent of choices and is uniquely
determined up to unique isomorphism by the classical action. We give a
geometric interpretation of the BRST cohomology sheaf in degree 0 and 1 as the
cohomology of a Lie-Rinehart algebra associated with the critical locus of the
classical action. Finally we consider the case of a quasi-projective varieties

just by links between its members. We study online social networks, in which
members may have certain attitude, positive or negative toward each other, and
so the network consists of a mixture of both positive and negative
relationships. Our goal is to predict the sign of a given relationship based on
the evidences provided in the current snapshot of the network. More precisely,
using machine learning techniques we develop a model that after being trained
on a particular network predicts the sign of an unknown or hidden link. The
model uses relationships and influences from peers as evidences for the guess,
however, the set of peers used is not predefined but rather learned during the
training process. We use quadratic correlation between peer members to train
the predictor. The model is tested on popular online datasets such as Epinions,
Slashdot, and Wikipedia. In many cases it shows almost perfect prediction
accuracy. Moreover, our model can also be efficiently updated as the
underlaying social network evolves.

derived. Since the Euler system is hyperbolic-elliptic coupled in a subsonic
region, so an effective decoupling of the hyperbolic and elliptic modes is
essential for any development of the theory. The key idea in our formulation is
to use the Bernoulli's law to reduce the dimension of the velocity field by
defining new variables $(1,\beta_2=\frac{u_2}{u_1},\beta_3=\frac{u_3}{u_1})$
and replacing $u_1$ by the Bernoulli's function $B$ through
$u_1^2=\frac{2(B-h(\rho))}{1+\beta_2^2+\beta_3^2}$. We find a conserved
quantity for flows with a constant Bernoulli's function, which behaves like the
scaled vorticity in the 2-D case. More surprisingly, a system of new
conservation laws can be derived, which is new even in the two dimensional
case. We use this new formulation to construct a smooth subsonic Euler flow in
a rectangular cylinder, which is also required to be adjacent to some special
subsonic states.

scattering at backward angle (~95 degrees) near the Delta(1232) resonance has
been measured using a hydrogen target. From this asymmetry, we extracted the
axial transition form factor G^A_{N\Delta}, a function of the axial Adler form
factors C^A_i. Though G^A_{N\Delta} has been previously studied using charged
current reactions, this is the first measurement of the weak neutral current
excitation of the Delta using a proton target. For Q^2 = 0.34 (GeV/c)^2 and W =
1.18 GeV, the asymmetry was measured to be -33.4 \pm (5.3)_{stat} \pm
(5.1)_{sys} ppm. The value of G^A_{N\Delta} determined from the hydrogen
asymmetry was -0.05 \pm (0.35)_{stat} \pm (0.34)_{sys} \pm (0.06)_{theory}.
These findings agree within errors with theoretical predictions for both the
total asymmetry and the form factor. In addition to the hydrogen measurement,
the asymmetry was measured at the same kinematics using a deuterium target. The
asymmetry for deuterium was determined to be -43.6 \pm (14.6)_{stat} \pm
(6.2)_{sys} ppm.

bounded system, with energy $E = Mc^2$ and effective size $R$, to its energy
$E$ i.e. $S/E < 2\pi k R/\hbar c$, we combine it with the holographic principle
(HP) bound ('t Hooft and Susskind) which is $S \le \pi k c^3R^2/\hbar G$. We
find that, if both bounds are identical, such bounded system is a black hole
(BH). For a system that is not a BH the two upper bounds are different. The
entropy of the system must obey the lowest bound. If the bounds are
proportional, the result is the proportionality between the mass M of the
system and its effective size $R$. When the constant of proportionality is
$2G/c^2$ the system in question is a BH, and the two bounds are identical. We
analyze the case for a universe. Then the universe is a BH in the sense that
its mass $M$ and its Hubble size $R \approx ct$, t the age of the universe,
follow the Schwarzschild relation $2GM/c^2 = R$. Finally, for a BH, the Hawking

the quantum of mass $\sim 10^{-66} g$ for our universe.
