with Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ALPT). Our method is based on
splitting the displacement field into a long and a short-range component. The
long-range component is computed by second order LPT (2LPT). This approximation
contains a tidal nonlocal and nonlinear term. Unfortunately, 2LPT fails on
small scales due to severe shell crossing and a crude quadratic behaviour in
the low density regime. The spherical collapse (SC) approximation has been
recently reported to correct for both effects by adding an ideal collapse
truncation. However, this approach fails to reproduce the structures on large
scales where it is significantly less correlated with the N-body result than
2LPT or linear LPT (the Zeldovich approximation). We propose to combine both
approximations using for the short-range displacement field the SC solution. A
Gaussian filter with a smoothing radius r_S is used to separate between both
regimes. We use the result of 25 dark matter only N-body simulations to
benchmark at z=0 the different approximations: 1st, 2nd, 3rd order LPT, SC and
our novel combined ALPT model. This comparison demonstrates that our method
improves previous approximations at all scales showing ~25% and ~75% higher
correlation than 2LPT with the N-body solution at k = 1 and 2 h Mpc^-1,
respectively. We conduct a parameter study to determine the optimal range of
smoothing radii and find that the maximum correlation is achieved with r_S = 4
- 5 h^-1 Mpc. This structure formation approach could be used for various
purposes, such as setting-up initial conditions for N-body simulations,
generating mock galaxy catalogues, cosmic web analysis or for reconstructions
of the primordial density fluctuations.

hierarchically block separable (HBS) matrices. Such matrices are generally
dense but data-sparse and can describe many important operators including those
derived from asymptotically smooth radial kernels that are not too oscillatory.
The algorithm is based on a recursive skeletonization procedure that exposes
this sparsity and solves the dense least squares problem as a larger,
equality-constrained, sparse one. It relies on a sparse QR factorization
coupled with iterative weighted least squares methods. In essence, our scheme
consists of a direct component, comprised of matrix compression and
factorization, followed by an iterative component to enforce certain equality
constraints. At most two iterations are typically required for problems that
are not too ill-conditioned. For an $M \times N$ HBS matrix with $M \geq N$
having bounded off-diagonal block rank, the algorithm has optimal $\mathcal{O}
(M + N)$ complexity. If the rank increases with the spatial dimension as is
common for operators that are singular at the origin, then this becomes
$\mathcal{O} (M + N)$ in 1D, $\mathcal{O} (M + N^{3/2})$ in 2D, and
$\mathcal{O} (M + N^{2})$ in 3D. We illustrate the performance of the method on
both over- and underdetermined systems in a variety of settings, with an
emphasis on radial basis function approximation and efficient updating and
downdating.

scalar top quark, $\tilde t \rightarrow {\tilde t}\chi_i^0, i =1-2$. The
phenomenology is quite interesting, since the expected polarization depends
both on the mixing in the stop and neutralino sectors and on the mass
differences between the stop and the neutralino. We find that a mixed stop
behaves almost like a right-handed stop due to the larger hypercharge that
enters the stop/top/gaugino coupling and that these polarisation effects
disappear, when $m_{\tilde t_1} \approx m_t+m_{\tilde\chi^0_i}$. After a
discussion on the expected top polarization from the decay of a scalar top
quark, we focus on the interplay of polarization and kinematics at the LHC. We
discuss different probes of the top polarization in terms of lab-frame
observables. We find that these observables faithfully reflect the polarization
of the parent top-quark, but also have a non-trivial dependence on the
kinematics of the stop production and decay process. In addition, we illustrate
the effect of top polarization on the energy and transverse momentum of the
decay lepton in the laboratory frame. Our results show that both spectra are
softened substantially in case of a negatively polarized top, particularly for
a large mass difference between the stop and the neutralino. Thus, the search
strategies, and the conclusions that can be drawn from them, depends not just
on the mass difference $m_{\tilde t} - m_{\tilde\chi_{i}^{0}}$ due to the usual
kinematic effects but also on the effects of top polarization on the decay
kinematics the extent of which depends in turn on the said mass difference.

space points, emerges from various approaches aiming to describe gravitational
phenomena in the limit of large curvatures. In particular, such behavior was
anticipated by Belinsky, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz (BKL) in their famous
conjecture put forward in the early seventies of the last century. While the
BKL conjecture is based on purely classical considerations, one can expect that
asymptotic silence should have its quantum counterpart at the level of a more
fundamental theory of quantum gravity, which is the relevant description of
gravitational phenomena in the limit of large energy densities. Here, we
summarize some recent results which give support to such a possibility. More
precisely, we discuss occurrence of the asymptotic silence due to
polymerization of space at the Planck scale, in the framework of loop quantum
cosmology. In the discussed model, the state of asymptotic silence is realized
at the energy density $\rho = \rho_c/2$, where $\rho_c$ is the maximal allowed
energy density, being of the order of the Planck energy density. At energy
densities $\rho > \rho_c/2$, the universe becomes 4D Euclidean space without
causal structure. Therefore, the asymptotic silence appears to be an
intermediate state of space between the Lorentzian and Euclidean phases.

asymmetry and is independent of the choice of the pumping parameters. When

We then discuss one such model with parameterized pairwise- and higher-order

increase the mutual information between a given stimulus type and the
population responses. For jointly Gaussian stimuli, coding performance is
improved by shaping output HOC only when neural firing rates are constrained to
be low. For stimuli with skewed probability distributions (like natural image
luminances), performance improves for all firing rates. Our work suggests
surprising connections between nonlinear integration of neural inputs, stimulus
statistics, and normative theories of population coding. Moreover, it suggests
that the inclusion of beyond-pairwise interactions could improve the
performance of Boltzmann machines for machine learning and signal processing

the planetary radius and (with radial velocity data) the planet mass. For the
study of planetary atmospheres, it is essential to obtain transit and
occultation measurements at multiple wavelengths.
  Aims: We aim to characterize the transiting hot Jupiter WASP-19b by deriving
accurate and precise planetary parameters from a dedicated observing campaign
of transits and occultations.
  Methods: We have obtained a total of 14 transit lightcurves in the r'-Gunn,
IC, z'-Gunn and I+z' filters and 10 occultation lightcurves in z'-Gunn using
EulerCam on the Euler-Swiss telescope and TRAPPIST. We have also obtained one
lightcurve through the narrow-band NB1190 filter of HAWK-I on the VLT measuring
an occultation at 1.19 micron. We have performed a global MCMC analysis of all
new data together with some archive data in order to refine the planetary
parameters and measure the occultation depths in z'-band and at 1.19 micron.
  Results: We measure a planetary radius of R_p = 1.376 (+/-0.046) R_j, a
planetary mass of M_p = 1.165 (+/-0.068) M_j, and find a very low eccentricity
of e = 0.0077 (+/-0.0068), compatible with a circular orbit. We have detected
the z'-band occultation at 3 sigma significance and measure it to be dF_z'= 352
(+/-116) ppm, more than a factor of 2 smaller than previously published. The
occultation at 1.19 micron is only marginally constrained at dF_1190 = 1711
(+/-745) ppm.
  Conclusions: We have shown that the detection of occultations in the visible
is within reach even for 1m class telescopes if a considerable number of
individual events are observed. Our results suggest an oxygen-dominated
atmosphere of WASP-19b, making the planet an interesting test case for
oxygen-rich planets without temperature inversion.

Gaussian compound Multiple Access Channel with common message (MACC) and with
intersymbol interference (ISI) under an input power constraint. The region is
obtained by converting the channel to its equivalent memoryless one by defining
an n-block memoryless circular Gaussian compound MACC model and applying the
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to decompose the n-block channel into a set of
independent parallel channels whose capacities can be found easily. Indeed, the
capacity region of the original Gaussian compound MACC equals that of the
n-block circular Gaussian compound MACC in the limit of infinite block length.
Then by using the obtained capacity region, we derive the capacity region of
the strong interference channel with common message and ISI.

uniformity of silica aerogels used as radiator in proximity-focusing
ring-imaging Cherenkov detectors. To obtain high performance in a large-area
detector, a key characteristic of radiator is the density (i.e. refractive
index) uniformity of an individual aerogel monolith. At a refractive index of n
= 1.05, our requirement for the refractive index uniformity in the transverse
plane direction of an aerogel tile is |\delta (n - 1)/(n - 1)| < 4% in a
focusing dual layer radiator (with different refractive indices) scheme. We
applied the radiographic technique to evaluate the density uniformity of our
original aerogels from a trial production and that of Panasonic products

within \pm 1% along the transverse plane direction. The measurement results
show that the proposed technique can quantitatively estimate the density

bottom quark and a light charged Higgs boson H+, t to bH+, in addition to the
Standard Model decay t to bW. Since W bosons decay to the three lepton
generations equally, while H+ may predominantly decay into tau+nu, charged
Higgs bosons can be searched for using the violation of lepton universality in
top quark decays. The analysis in this paper is based on 4.6/fb of
proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV collected by the ATLAS
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. Signatures containing leptons (e or
mu) and/or a hadronically decaying tau (tau_had) are used. Event yield ratios
between e+tau_had and e+mu, as well as between mu+tau_had and mu+e, final
states are measured in the data and compared to predictions from simulations.
This ratio-based method reduces the impact of systematic uncertainties in the
analysis. No significant deviation from the Standard Model predictions is
observed. With the assumption that the branching fraction B(H+ to tau+nu) is
100%, upper limits in the range 3.2%-4.4% can be placed on the branching

field also increases stripe correlations between the planes, which can result
in an enhanced frustration of the interlayer Josephson coupling. Close to the

Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) in multiple space dimensions. High order spatial
accuracy is obtained through a WENO reconstruction, while a high order one-step
time discretization is achieved using a local space-time discontinuous Galerkin
predictor method. Due to the one-step nature of the underlying scheme, the
resulting algorithm is particularly well suited for an AMR strategy on
space-time adaptive meshes, i.e.with time-accurate local time stepping. The AMR
property has been implemented 'cell-by-cell', with a standard tree-type
algorithm, while the scheme has been parallelized via the Message Passing
Interface (MPI) paradigm. The new scheme has been tested over a wide range of
examples for nonlinear systems of hyperbolic conservation laws, including the
classical Euler equations of compressible gas dynamics and the equations of
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). High order in space and time have been confirmed
via a numerical convergence study and a detailed analysis of the computational
speed-up with respect to highly refined uniform meshes is also presented. We
also show test problems where the presented high order AMR scheme behaves
clearly better than traditional second order AMR methods. The proposed scheme
that combines for the first time high order ADER methods with space--time
adaptive grids in two and three space dimensions is likely to become a useful
tool in several fields of computational physics, applied mathematics and

edges appearing at random times. At unknown time points, subgroups of vertices
may exhibit a change in behavior. Such changes may take the form of a change in
the overall probability of connection within or between subgroups, or a change
in the distribution of edge attributes. A mixture distribution for latent
vertex positions is used to detect heterogeneities in connectivity behavior
over time and over vertices. The probability of edges with various attributes
at a given time is modeled using a latent-space stochastic process associated
with each vertex. A random dot product model is used to describe the dependency
structure of the graph. As an application we analyze the Enron email corpus.

the 6dF Galaxy Survey. The near-infrared selection of 6dFGS allows more
reliable stellar mass estimates compared to optical bands used in other galaxy
surveys. Using the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model, we investigate the
trend of dark matter halo mass and satellite fraction with stellar mass by
measuring the projected correlation function, $w_p(r_p)$. We find that the
typical halo mass ($M_1$) as well as the satellite power law index ($\alpha$)
increase with stellar mass. This indicates, (1) that galaxies with higher
stellar mass sit in more massive dark matter halos and (2) that these more
massive dark matter halos accumulate satellites faster with growing mass
compared to halos occupied by low stellar mass galaxies. Furthermore we find a
relation between $M_1$ and the minimum dark matter halo mass ($M_{\rm min}$) of
$M_1 \approx 22\,M_{\rm min}$, in agreement with similar findings for SDSS
galaxies. The satellite fraction of 6dFGS galaxies declines with increasing
stellar mass from 21% at $M_{\rm stellar} = 2.6\times10^{10}h^{-2}\,M_{\odot}$
to 12% at $M_{\rm stellar} = 5.4\times10^{10}h^{-2}\,M_{\odot}$ indicating that
high stellar mass galaxies are more likely to be central galaxies. We compare
our results to two different semi-analytic models derived from the Millennium
Simulation, finding some disagreement. Our results can be used for placing new
constraints on semi-analytic models in the future, particularly the behaviour
of luminous red satellites. Finally we compare our results to studies of halo
occupation using galaxy-galaxy weak lensing. We find good overall agreement,
representing a valuable crosscheck for these two different tools of studying
the matter distribution in the Universe.

that all four of these galaxies are undergoing ram pressure stripping by the
Intracluster Medium (ICM). The manner in which the stripped gas trailing the
galaxies interacts with the ICM, however, is observably distinct. Consistent
with previous observations, M86 is observed to have a long tail of ~ 1 keV gas

of ~ 0.6 keV thermal emission is observed to span to the east of M86 in the

coincident with filaments of H-alpha emission, likely originating in a recent

of stripped ~ 0.6 keV gas to the south of M84, suggesting that this galaxy is
undergoing both AGN feedback and ram pressure stripping simultaneously. These

transiting planets to date. The Kepler mission provides superior time series
photometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability. The
initial release catalogue (Greiss et al. 2012) concerned data taken between May
and August 2011, using the Isaac Newton Telescope on the island of La Palma.
Four broadband filters were used, U, g, r, i, as well as one narrowband one,
H-alpha, reaching down to a limit of ~20th mag in the Vega system. Observations
covering ~50 sq.deg passed our quality control thresholds and constituted the
first data release. Here we report on the second data release, covering an
additional ~63 sq.deg of the Kepler field. We apply the exact same quality
control criteria and photometric calibration as in the initial release
catalogue (see Greiss et al. (2012) for further details). The global
photometric calibration was derived by placing the KIS magnitudes as close as
possible to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) ones. The second data release
catalogue containing ~14.5 million sources from all the good photometric KIS
fields is available for download from the KIS webpage, as well as from the
Kepler Target Search page at MAST. It includes all the objects from the initial
data release catalogue and covers ~97% of the Kepler field. Therefore this
release adds ~8.5 million sources to the initial data release catalogue, all
observed between May and August 2012. The remaining ~3% of the field will be
completed once the Kepler field is visible in 2013.

approaches for solving the resulted non-convex DC problem are based on

is non-convex. Then, the optimal value function is replaced with another

moon-magnetosphere system with respect a to variable upstream magnetic field
and flux or density distributions of plasma and energetic ions, electrons, and
neutral atoms. This capability is critical for improving the interpretation of
the existing Europa flyby measurements from the Galileo Orbiter mission, and
for planning flyby and orbital measurements (including the surface and
atmospheric compositions) for future missions. The simulations are based on
recent models of the atmosphere of Europa (Cassidy et al., 2007; Shematovich et
al., 2005). In contrast to previous approaches with MHD simulations, the hybrid
model allows us to fully take into account the finite gyroradius effect and
electron pressure, and to correctly estimate the ion velocity distribution and
the fluxes along the magnetic field (assuming an initial Maxwellian velocity
distribution for upstream background ions). In this paper we discuss two tasks:
(1) the plasma wake structure dependence on the parameters of the upstream
plasma and Europa's atmosphere (model I, cases (a) and (b) with a homogeneous
Jovian magnetosphere field, an inductive magnetic dipole and high oceanic shell
conductivity); and (2) estimation of the possible effect of an induced magnetic
field arising from oceanic shell conductivity. This effect was estimated based
on the difference between the observed and modeled magnetic fields (model II,
case (c) with an inhomogeneous Jovian magnetosphere field, an inductive
magnetic dipole and low oceanic shell conductivity).

model data in numerous machine learning and signal processing tasks.
Traditionally, such modeling approaches rely on an iterative algorithm that
minimizes an objective function with parsimony-promoting terms. The inherently
sequential structure and data-dependent complexity and latency of iterative
optimization constitute a major limitation in many applications requiring
real-time performance or involving large-scale data. Another limitation
encountered by these modeling techniques is the difficulty of their inclusion
in discriminative learning scenarios. In this work, we propose to move the
emphasis from the model to the pursuit algorithm, and develop a process-centric
view of parsimonious modeling, in which a learned deterministic
fixed-complexity pursuit process is used in lieu of iterative optimization. We
show a principled way to construct learnable pursuit process architectures for
structured sparse and robust low rank models, derived from the iteration of
proximal descent algorithms. These architectures learn to approximate the exact
parsimonious representation at a fraction of the complexity of the standard
optimization methods. We also show that appropriate training regimes allow to
naturally extend parsimonious models to discriminative settings.
State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on several challenging problems in
image and audio processing with several orders of magnitude speedup compared to
the exact optimization algorithms.

value of J_2^L=0.52036(6)J_1, the Lifshitz point, the peak in the static
structure factor begins to move away from k=\pi. Here, we focus on chains with
an odd number of sites. In this case the disorder point is also at J_2^d=1/2
J_1, but the behavior close to the Lifshitz point, J_2^L approx. 0.538 J_1, is
quite different: starting at J_2^L, the ground-state goes through a sequence of
level crossings as its momentum changes away from k=\pi/2. An even length
chain, on the other hand, is gapped for any J_2>0.24J_1 and has the
ground-state momentum k=0. This gradual change in the ground-state wave
function for chains with an odd number of sites is reflected in a dramatic
manner directly in the ground-state on-site magnetization as well as in the
bi-partite von Neumann entanglement entropy. Our results are based on DMRG

  Photosphere to the Corona ASP Conference Series, Vol. 463",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When we examine the chirality or observed handedness of the chromospheric and
coronal structures involved in the long-term build-up to eruptive events, we
find that they evolve in very specific ways to form two and only two sets of
large-scale chiral systems. Each system contains spatially separated components
with both signs of chirality, the upper portion having negative (positive)
chirality and the lower part possessing positive (negative) chirality. The
components within a system are a filament channel (represented partially by
sets of chromospheric fibrils), a filament (if present), a filament cavity,
sometimes a sigmoid, and always an overlying arcade of coronal loops. When we
view these components as parts of large-scale chiral systems, we more clearly
see that it is not the individual components of chiral systems that erupt but
rather it is the approximate upper parts of an entire evolving chiral system
that erupts. We illustrate the typical pattern of build-up to eruptive solar
events first without and then including the chirality in each stage of the
build-up. We argue that a complete chiral system has one sign of handedness
above the filament spine and the opposite handedness in the barbs and filament
channel below the filament spine. If the spine has handedness, the observations
favor its having the handedness of the filament cavity and coronal loops above.
As the separate components of a chiral system form, we show that the system
appears to maintain a balance of right-handed and left-handed features, thus
preserving an initial near-zero net helicity. Each individual chiral system may
produce many successive eruptive events above a single filament channel.

neuroscience, we consider the following general problem in statistical
inference. When exposed to a high-dimensional signal S, a system of interest
computes a representation R of that signal which is then observed through a
noisy measurement M. From a large number of signals and measurements, we wish
to infer the ""filter"" that maps S to R. However, the standard method for
solving such problems, likelihood-based inference, requires perfect a priori
knowledge of the ""noise function"" mapping R to M. In practice such noise
functions are usually known only approximately, if at all, and using an
incorrect noise function will typically bias the inferred filter. Here we show
that, in the large data limit, this need for a pre-characterized noise function
can be circumvented by searching for filters that instead maximize the mutual
information I[M;R] between observed measurements and predicted representations.
Moreover, if the correct filter lies within the space of filters being
explored, maximizing mutual information becomes equivalent to simultaneously
maximizing every dependence measure that satisfies the Data Processing
Inequality. It is important to note that maximizing mutual information will
typically leave a small number of directions in parameter space unconstrained.
We term these directions ""diffeomorphic modes"" and present an equation that
allows these modes to be derived systematically. The presence of diffeomorphic
modes reflects a fundamental and nontrivial substructure within parameter
space, one that is obscured by standard likelihood-based inference.

scenario. In this scenario, the relay and the source nodes jointly optimize
their power allocation strategies to achieve network optimality. Unlike the
relay optimization scenario considered in part I which features low complexity
but does not achieve network optimality, the network-level optimal power
allocation can be achieved in the network optimization scenario at the cost of
higher complexity. The network optimization problem is considered in two cases
each with several subcases. It is shown that the considered problem, which is
originally nonconvex, can be transferred into different convex problems for all
but two subcases. For the remaining two subcases, one for each case, it is
proved that the optimal strategies for the source nodes and the relay must
satisfy certain properties. Based on these properties, an algorithm is proposed
for finding the optimal solution. The effect of asymmetry in the number of
antennas, power limits, and channel statistics is also considered. Such
asymmetry is shown to have a negative effect on both the achievable sum-rate
and the power allocation efficiency in MIMO DF TWR. Simulation results
demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the effect of
asymmetry in the system.

developed an algorithm to compute the Green's function for any point inside a
medium to points on the surface from measurements on that surface only. Their
algorithm is based on focusing an incoming wavefield to a single point in order
to create a virtual source at the focus. The procedure has been justified only
by heuristic arguments. In this paper I am using simple physical arguments to
prove an integral equation for single-sided, higher-dimensional inverse
scattering. This integral equation is equivalent to the Wapenaar iteration
algorithm. The equation will be exact, including all internal multiple
reflections. The derivation makes use of time-invariance but does not use the
explicit form of the wave equation. It is therefore not only applicable to the
acoustic wave equation, but also to other time-reversal invariant systems.
Potential areas include seismology, electronics, microwave and ultrasonic
inverse scattering as well as quantum physics. The simplicity and generality of
the argument will make this paper accessible to researchers from all the

equation of centrifugal equilibrium and depends on local and quite well known
quantities such as the angular Sun's velocity, the disk to dark contribution to
the circular velocity at the Sun, and the thin stellar disk scale length. This
determination is independent of the shape of the dark matter density profile,
the knowledge of the rotation curve at any radius, and the very uncertain
bulge/disk/dark-halo mass decomposition. The result is: $\rho_\odot=0.43

uncertainty a) in the slope of the circular-velocity at the Sun location and b)
in the ratio between this radius and the exponential length scale of the

estimates on the ground state energy. An interesting aspect is a significant
difference between 'soft' anharmonic traps (like a quartic plus quadratic
trapping potential) and traps with a fixed boundary. In the former case
vortices persist in the bulk until the width of the annulus becomes comparable

takes place in a parameter regime where the size of vortices is very small

for any vertex $v$, $\tau(v)=\lceil (deg^{in}(v)+1)/2 \rceil$, where

Next we show that any directed graph on $n$ vertices and with positive minimum

error probability) for n uses of a discrete memoryless channel is upper bounded
by the normal approximation plus a third-order term that does not exceed 1/2
log n + O(1) if the epsilon-dispersion of the channel is positive. This matches
a lower bound by Y. Polyanskiy (2010) for discrete memoryless channels with
positive reverse dispersion. If the epsilon-dispersion vanishes, the logarithm
of the epsilon-error capacity is upper bounded by the n times the capacity plus
a constant term except for a small class of DMCs and epsilon >= 1/2.

(AENC-AEI) known non-causally at the transmitter is studied. This channel can
be considered as an exponential version of the discrete memoryless channel with
state known non-causally at the encoder considered by Gelfand and Pinsker. We
make use of Gelfand-Pinsker classic capacity Theorem to derive inner and outer
bounds on the capacity of this channel under a non-negative input constraint as
well as a constraint on the mean value of the input. First we obtain an outer
bound for AENC-AEI. Then by using the input distribution achieving the outer
bound, we derive an inner bound which this inner bound coincides with the
obtained outer bound at high signal to noise ratios (SNRs) and therefore, gives
the capacity of the AENC-AEI at high SNRs.

hemispherical anisotropy of supernova type Ia (SN Ia) Hubble diagrams at low
redshifts (z<0.2).
  We compare the best fit Hubble diagrams in pairs of hemispheres and search
for the maximal asymmetric orientation. For an isotropic Universe, we expect
only a small asymmetry due to noise and the presence of nearby structures. This
test does not depend on the assumed content of the Universe, the assumed model
of gravity, or the spatial curvature of the Universe. The expectation for
possible fluctuations due to large scale structure is evaluated for the \Lambda
cold dark matter (\Lambda CDM) model and is compared to the supernova data from
the Constitution set for four different light curve fitters, thus allowing a
study of the systematic effects.
  The expected order of magnitude of the hemispherical asymmetry of the Hubble
expansion agrees with the observed one. The direction of the Hubble asymmetry
is established at 95% confidence level (C.L.) using both, the MLCS2k2 and the
SALT II light curve fitter. The highest expansion rate is found towards (l, b)
~ (-35{\deg},-19{\deg}), which agrees with directions reported by other
studies. Its amplitude is not in contradiction to expectations from the \Lambda
CDM model. The measured Hubble anisotropy is \Delta H/H ~ 0.026. With 95% C.L.
the expansion asymmetry is \Delta H/H<0.038.

neutrinos with opposite lepton numbers are added to the Standard Model. In this
model, the smallness of the neutrino mass is explained by the tiny lepton
number violating coupling between one of the singlets with the standard
left-handed neutrinos. This allows one to have the right handed neutrino mass
at the TeV scale as well as appreciable mixing between the light and heavy
states. This model is fully reconstructible in terms of the neutrino
oscillation parameters apart from the overall coupling strengths. We show that
the overall coupling strength $y_\nu$ for the Dirac type coupling between the
left handed neutrino and one of the singlets can be restricted by consideration
of the (meta)stability bounds on the electroweak vacuum. In this scenario the
lepton flavor violating decays of charged leptons can be appreciable which can
put further constraint on $y_\nu$, for right-handed neutrinos at TeV scale. We
discuss the combined constraints on $y_\nu$ for this scenario from the process
$\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ and from the consideration of vacuum (meta)stability
constraints on the Higgs self coupling. We also briefly discuss the
implications for neutrinoless double beta decay and possible signatures of the
model that can be expected at colliders.
