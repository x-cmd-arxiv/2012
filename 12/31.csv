variable U Del is analyzed. From the international AFOEV database, 6231
brightness values in the time interval JD 2451602-55378 were chosen. For the
periodogram analysis, we have used a trigonometric polynomial fit. Using the
criterion of minimal variance of the approximation at arguments of
observations, the optimal degree is s=1. Initial epoch for maximum is
T0=JD2453340(3), the period P=1198(4)d. Mean brightness at maximum is 6.624(5),
at minimum 7.124(5), i.e. the amplitude is 0.499(5)m. Besides this slow
variability, there is a faster oscillation of a period of 119.45(6)d, amplitude
0.303(5)m and an initial epoch for maximum 2453215.1(5). These results are mean
during the time interval after that analyzed in the catalogue of Chinarova and
Andronov (2000). Also the method of ""running sines"" with a filter half-width
Delta t=0.5P. The local mean (averaged over a short period) brightness varies
in a range 6.58-7.41m, the semi-amplitude exhibits very strong variations from
0.01 to 0.46m. The phase is also variable - typically of a full amplitude of
0.5. Close to JD 2452589, occurred a phase jump by a complete period during a
descending branch of a slow wave. This effect was not observed during other
cycles. No significant correlation between mean brightness and amplitude of
short-period oscillation was found. Despite significant variability of
amplitude, the periodic contribution is not statistically significant. Also
characteristics of individual brightness extrema were found. The study was made
in a course of the international project ""Inter-Longitude Astronomy"" (Andronov

on mathematical sequences, constructed by an inflation rule P = {w -> s, s ->

chain. Higher-dimensional quasiperiodic tilings are constructed as a direct
product of these chains and their eigenstates can be directly calculated by
multiplying the energies or wave functions of the chain, respectively.
  Applying this construction rule, the grid in d dimensions splits into 2^(d-1)
different tilings, for which we investigated the characteristics of the wave
functions. For the standard two-dimensional labyrinth tiling constructed from
the octonacci sequence (b=2) the lattice breaks up into two identical lattices,
which consequently yield the same eigenstates. While this is not the case for
other b, our numerical results show that the wave functions of the different
grids become increasingly similar for large system sizes. This can be explained
by the fact that the structure of the 2^(d-1) grids mainly differs at the
boundaries and thus for large systems the eigenstates approach each other. This
property allows us to analytically derive properties of the higher-dimensional
generalized labyrinth tilings from the one-dimensional results. In particular
participation numbers and corresponding scaling exponents have been determined.

models derived via robust comparative statics. It is therefore important to
design effective and practical econometric methods for testing this prediction
in empirical analysis. This paper develops a general nonparametric framework
for testing monotonicity of a regression function. Using this framework, a
broad class of new tests is introduced, which gives an empirical researcher a
lot of flexibility to incorporate ex ante information she might have. The paper
also develops new methods for simulating critical values, which are based on
the combination of a bootstrap procedure and new selection algorithms. These
methods yield tests that have correct asymptotic size and are asymptotically
nonconservative. It is also shown how to obtain an adaptive rate optimal test
that has the best attainable rate of uniform consistency against models whose
regression function has Lipschitz-continuous first-order derivatives and that
automatically adapts to the unknown smoothness of the regression function.
Simulations show that the power of the new tests in many cases significantly
exceeds that of some prior tests, e.g. that of Ghosal, Sen, and Van der Vaart

This popular technique relies on uncontrolled approximations to obtain a
closure for a hierarchy of equations, however its accuracy is questioned. We
focus on 4 different closures, 2 of which were previously proposed in the
context of the single quantum dot system (Anderson impurity model) and were
extended to the double quantum dot array, and develop 2 new closures. Results
for the differential conductance are compared to those attained by a master
equation approach known to be accurate for weak system-leads couplings and high
temperatures. While all 4 closures provide an accurate description of the
Coulomb blockade and other transport properties in the single quantum dot case,
they differ in the case of the double quantum dot array, where only one of the
developed closures provides satisfactory results.This is rationalized by
comparing the poles of the Green functions to the exact many-particle energy
differences for the isolate system. Our analysis provides means to extend the
equation-of-motion technique to more elaborate models of large bridge systems

the entropy of a closed system should monotonically change in time. In
information processing, the entropy production is positive for random
transformation of signals (the information processing lemma). Originally, the
$H$-theorem and the information processing lemma were proved for the classical
Boltzmann-Gibbs-Shannon entropy and for the correspondent divergence (the
relative entropy). Many new entropies and divergences have been proposed during
last decades and for all of them the $H$-theorem is needed. This note proposes
a simple and general criterion to check whether the $H$-theorem is valid for a
convex divergence $H$ and demonstrates that some of the popular divergences
obey no $H$-theorem. We consider systems with $n$ states $A_i$ that obey first
order kinetics (master equation). A convex function $H$ is a Lyapunov function
for all master equations with given equilibrium if and only if its conditional
minima properly describe the equilibria of pair transitions $A_i
\rightleftharpoons A_j$. This theorem does not depend on the principle of
detailed balance and is valid for general Markov kinetics. Elementary analysis
of pair equilibria demonstrates that the popular Bregman divergences like
Euclidean distance or Itakura-Saito distance in the space of distribution
cannot be the universal Lyapunov functions for the first-order kinetics and can
increase in Markov processes. Therefore, they violate the second law and the
information processing lemma. In particular, for these measures of information
(divergences) random manipulation with data may add information to data. The
main results are extended to nonlinear generalized mass action law kinetic
equations. In Appendix, a new family of the universal Lyapunov functions for
the generalized mass action law kinetics is described.

modes, this leads to the observed value for the vacuum energy density.

core-bulk heterostructure made of 3D topological insulator (TI) materials, such
as PbTe/Pb$_{0.31}$Sn$_{0.69}$Te, with bound massless and helical Weyl states
existing at the interface and being confined in all three dimensions. The
number of bound states can be controlled by tuning the size of the QD and the
magnitude of the core and bulk energy gaps, which determine the confining
potential. We demonstrate that such bound Weyl states can be realized for QD
sizes of few nanometers. We identify the spin locking and the Kramers pairs,
both hallmarks of 3D TIs. In contrast to topologically trivial semiconductor
QDs, the confined massless Weyl states in 3D TI QDs are localized at the
interface of the QD and exhibit a mirror symmetry in the energy spectrum. We
find strict optical selection rules satisfied by both interband and intraband
transitions that depend on the polarization of electron-hole pairs and
therefore give rise to the Faraday effect due to Pauli exclusion principle. We
show that the semi-classical Faraday effect can be used to read out spin
quantum memory. When a 3D TI QD is embedded inside a cavity, the single-photon
Faraday rotation provides the possibility to implement optically mediated
quantum teleportation and quantum information processing with 3D TI QDs, where
the qubit is defined by either an electron-hole pair, a single electron spin,
or a single hole spin in a 3D TI QD. Remarkably, the combination of inter- and
intraband transition gives rise to a large dipole moment of up to 450 Debye.
Therefore, the strong-coupling regime can be reached for a cavity quality
factor of $Q\approx10^{4}$ in the infrared wavelength regime of around
$10\:\mu$m.

precisely measured quantities in pp collisions at LHC. This offers
opportunities for multitude of precision measurements. It is of practical
importance to verify if precision measurements with lep- tons in the final
state require all theoretical effects evaluated simultaneously or if QED
bremsstrahlung in the final state can be separated without unwanted precision
loss. Results for final state bremsstrahlung in the decays of narrow resonances
are obtained from the Feynman rules of QED in an unambiguous way and can be
controlled with a very high precision. Also for resonances of non-negligible
width, if calculations are appropriately performed, such separation from the
remaining electroweak effects can be expected. Our paper is devoted to
validation that final state QED bremsstrahlung can indeed be separated from the
rest of QCD and electroweak effects, in the production and decay of Z and W
bosons, and to estimation of the resulting systematic error. The quantitative
discussion is based on Monte Carlo programs PHOTOS and SANC, as well as on KKMC
which is used for benchmark results. We show, that for a large classes of W and
Z boson observables as used at LHC, theoretical error on photonic
bremsstrahlung is 0.1 or 0.2%, depending on the program options used. An
overall theoretical error on QED final state radiation, i.e. taking into
account missing corrections due to pair emission and interference with initial

The three-string S-matrix satisfies the tetrahedron equation which is a 3D
analog of the Yang-Baxter equation. Each S-matrix depends on three dihedral
angles formed by three intersecting planes, whereas the tetrahedron equation
contains five independent spectral parameters, associated with angles of an
Euclidean tetrahedron. The vertex weights are given by rather complicated
expressions involving square roots of trigonometric function of the spectral
parameters, which is quite unusual from the point of view of 2D solvable
lattice models. In this paper we consider a particular four-parameter
specialization of the tetrahedron equation when one of its vertices goes to
infinity and the tetrahedron itself degenerates into an infinite prism. We show
that in this limit all the vertex weights in the tetrahedron equation can be
represented as meromorphic functions on an elliptic curve. Moreover we show
that a special reduction of the tetrahedron equation in this case leads
precisely to an example of the tetrahedral Zamolodchikov algebra, previously

about certain group-valued flows: examples are the cycle double cover
conjecture, Berge-Fulkerson conjecture, and Tutte's 3-flow, 4-flow, and 5-flow
conjectures. As an approach to these problems Jaeger and DeVos,
Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, and Raspaud define a notion of graph morphisms continuous
with respect to group-valued flows. We discuss the influence of the group on
these maps. In particular, we prove that the number of flow-continuous mappings
between two graphs does not depend on the group, but only on the largest order
of an element of the group (i.e., on the exponent of the group). Further, there
is a nice algebraic structure describing for which groups a mapping is
flow-continuous.
  On the combinatorial side, we show that for cubic graphs the only relevant
groups are $\Z_2$, $\Z_3$, and $\Z$.

the first order phase transition in which the EOS becomes always soft due to
the presence of the quark matter at high density. Although the choice of the

emerging contentious situations, rapid detection of disease outbreaks, or
accurate forecasting of the ultimate reach of potentially viral ideas or
behaviors. This paper proposes a new approach to this predictive analytics
problem, in which analysis of meso-scale network dynamics is leveraged to
generate useful predictions for complex social phenomena. We begin by deriving
a stochastic hybrid dynamical systems (S-HDS) model for diffusion processes
taking place over social networks with realistic topologies; this modeling
approach is inspired by recent work in biology demonstrating that S-HDS offer a
useful mathematical formalism with which to represent complex, multi-scale
biological network dynamics. We then perform formal stochastic reachability
analysis with this S-HDS model and conclude that the outcomes of social
diffusion processes may depend crucially upon the way the early dynamics of the
process interacts with the underlying network's community structure and
core-periphery structure. This theoretical finding provides the foundations for
developing a machine learning algorithm that enables accurate early warning
analysis for social diffusion events. The utility of the warning algorithm, and
the power of network-based predictive metrics, are demonstrated through an
empirical investigation of the propagation of political memes over social media
networks. Additionally, we illustrate the potential of the approach for
security informatics applications through case studies involving early warning
analysis of large-scale protests events and politically-motivated cyber
attacks.

recoils produced from \gamma-rays photodisintegrating the nuclei of the liquid.
The main advantage of the new target-detector system is a gain in yield of six
orders of magnitude over conventional gas targets due to the higher mass
density of liquids. Also, the detector is practically insensitive to the
\gamma-ray beam itself, thus allowing it to detect only the products of the
nuclear reaction of interest. The first set of tests of a superheated target
with a narrow bandwidth \gamma-ray beam was completed and the results
demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme. The new data are successfully
described by an R-matrix model using published resonance parameters. With the
increase in luminosity of the next generation \gamma-ray beam facilities, the
measurement of thermonuclear rates in the stellar Gamow window would become

normalized weighted root mean square percentage deviation between the observed
data and model estimates of the data, with g%SD = 0 being a perfectly fitting
model. However, this criterion may not be adjusting for the number of
parameters in the model comprehensively. Thus, its relationship to more
traditional measures for maximizing useful information in a model, including
AIC and BIC, are examined. This results in an extended set of fit criteria
including g%AIC and g%BIC. Further, a broader range of asymptotically most
powerful fit criteria of the power divergence family, which includes maximum
likelihood (or minimum G^2) and minimum X^2 modeling as special cases, are used
to replace the sum of squares fit criterion within the g%SD criterion. Results
are illustrated with a set of genetic distances looking particularly at a range

with non-zero total momentum Cooper pairs in a strong magnetic field, was
predicted more than 50 years ago and now becomes an important concept in many
branches of physics. However, no unambiguous experimental evidences for the
existence of FFLO phases have been observed yet. Recently, spin-imbalanced
ultracold degenerate Fermi gases have emerged as a new powerful platform for
the observation of FFLO phases due to their high experimental controllability
and the lack of disorder. However, in three dimensional degenerate Fermi gases
where the FFLO phases can be described within the simple mean field theory, the
parameter region for the FFLO phases is too small to be observed in
experiments. Recently, we showed that the Rashba type spin-orbit coupling and
in-plane Zeeman field in three dimensional degenerate Fermi gases provide a
more efficient way to create the FFLO phase because (1) the parameter region
for the FFLO phase is greatly enlarged in the phase diagram and (2) the FFLO
phase is stabilized due to the enhanced energy difference between FFLO phase
and conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase. In this work we
investigate the FFLO phase in two dimensional spin-orbit coupled degenerate
Fermi gases using the mean field theory, with special concerns on the physical
origin of the FFLO state. The basic properties of the FFLO phase are discussed
and the phase diagram is obtained at zero temperature. The symmetry of
different quantum phases is examined, which provide important basis for the
experimental observation of FFLO phases using the time-of-flight imaging.

that the seesaw parameters are constrained by the CMB spectra. The 2-$\sigma$

directly relevant to widely used FMR experimental techniques for extracting

carry over to corresponding nanometer-sized patterned devices. We show that
there can be significant variation in the FMR response with device size, and
that the extent of the variation depends on the magnetic material properties.
This explains, for example, why different experiments along these lines have
yielded different size-dependent trends from damping measurements. Observed
trends with increasing size and different material parameters are explained
through the evolution of three distinct eigen-modes, demonstrating the
respective roles of demagnetization and exchange. It is also shown that there
is a crossover of dominant eigen-modes in the response signal, accompanied by
conjugating edge-type modes, leading to evident effects in measured linewidth
and damping. Among the sizes considered, in higher saturation magnetization, we
observe as much as a 40% increase in apparent damping, due solely to device

methods that enable a mobile manipulator to autonomously learn a function that
takes an RGB image and a registered 3D point cloud as input and returns a 3D
location at which a manipulation behavior is likely to succeed. Given a pair of
manipulation behaviors that can change the state of the world between two sets
(e.g., light switch up and light switch down), classifiers that detect when
each behavior has been successful, and an initial hint as to where one of the
behaviors will be successful, the robot autonomously trains a pair of support
vector machine (SVM) classifiers by trying out the behaviors at locations in
the world and observing the results. When an image feature vector associated
with a 3D location is provided as input to one of the SVMs, the SVM predicts if
the associated manipulation behavior will be successful at the 3D location. To
evaluate our approach, we performed experiments with a PR2 robot from Willow
Garage in a simulated home using behaviors that flip a light switch, push a
rocker-type light switch, and operate a drawer. By using active learning, the
robot efficiently learned SVMs that enabled it to consistently succeed at these
tasks. After training, the robot also continued to learn in order to adapt in

good agreement with the proper-motion cluster membership probability. However,
for proper-motion non-member stars, the membership probability estimated by the

be because of the fundamental differences between the two methods of
determination: one is based on stellar proper-motion in space and the other is
based on selective extinction of the stellar output by the asymmetric aligned
dust grains present in the interstellar medium. The results and analysis
suggest that the scatter of the Stokes vectors q(%) and u(%) for the

be used to estimate the cluster membership probability if we have additional
polarimetric and photometric information for a star to identify it as a

the dispersion in the polarimetric position angles (\epsilon), reddening
(E(B-V)) or the differential intra-cluster reddening (\Delta E(B-V)). This

Dykstra's algorithm, converges strongly in a Hilbert space. Moreover, this
algorithm converges in finitely many iterations when the closed convex sets are
cones in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ satisfying an alignment condition. Next, we propose
modifications of the alternating projection algorithm, and prove its
convergence. The algorithm converges superlinearly in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ under
some nice conditions. Under a conical condition, the convergence can be finite.
Lastly, we discuss the case where the intersection of the sets is empty.

CSM-Matching also generalizes the maximum-weight matching problem, which has a

CSM-Matching within a factor of e/(e-1) by reducing the max k-cover problem to
it. Our main result is a simple, greedy, 3-approximation algorithm for
CSM-Matching. Then we reduce CSM-Matching to maximizing a nonnegative,

CSM-2-Matroids has a (2+epsilon)-approximation algorithm - called LSV2. We show

calibration and validation. These are usually done by comparing measured
properties of the dynamics found in observation, experiments and simulation in
certain scenarios. For this the scenarios first need to be sensitive to
parameter changes of a particular model or - if models are compared -
differences between models. Second it is helpful if the exhibited differences
can be expressed in quantities which are as simple as possible ideally a single
number. Such a scenario is proposed in this contribution together with
evaluation measures. In an example evaluation of a particular model it is shown
that the proposed evaluation measures are very sensitive to parameter changes
and therefore summarize differences effects of parameter changes and
differences between models efficiently, sometimes in a single number. It is
shown how the symmetry which exists in the achiral geometry of the proposed
example scenario is broken in particular simulation runs exhibiting chiral
dynamics, while in the statistics of 1,000 simulation runs there is a symmetry
between left- and right-chiral dynamics. In the course of the symmetry breaking
differences between models and parameter settings are amplified which is the
origin of the high sensitivity of the scenario against parameter changes.

propagate by a procedure in which an individual adopts the new behavior if the
fraction of his neighbors or friends having adopted the new behavior exceeds
some threshold. In this paper we study the question of whether the emergence of

would describe the behavior of non-cooperative rational members of some social

to access or not some content, based on the number of views that the content

but also the way in which information about the quality of a given content can
be deduced from view counts when only part of the viewers that access the
content are informed about its quality. In this paper we present a game
formulation for the behavior of individuals using a meanfield model: the number
of individuals is approximated by a continuum of atomless players and for which
the Wardrop equilibrium is the solution concept. We derive conditions on the
problem's parameters that result indeed in the emergence of threshold
equilibria policies. But we also identify some parameters in which other

The edge labels of such a path have to form a word that matches a given regular
expression. We investigate the evaluation of RPQs with an additional constraint
that prevents multiple traversals of the same nodes. Those regular simple path
queries (RSPQs) find several applications in practice, yet they quickly become
intractable, even for basic languages such as (aa)* or a*ba*.
  In this paper, we establish a comprehensive classification of regular
languages with respect to the complexity of the corresponding regular simple
path query problem. More precisely, we identify the fragment that is maximal in
the following sense: regular simple path queries can be evaluated in polynomial
time for every regular language L that belongs to this fragment and evaluation
is NP-complete for languages outside this fragment. We thus fully characterize
the frontier between tractability and intractability for RSPQs, and we refine
our results to show the following trichotomy: Evaluations of RSPQs is either
AC0, NL-complete or NP-complete in data complexity, depending on the regular
language L. The fragment identified also admits a simple characterization in
terms of regular expressions.
  Finally, we also discuss the complexity of the following decision problem:
decide, given a language L, whether finding a regular simple path for L is
tractable. We consider several alternative representations of L: DFAs, NFAs or
regular expressions, and prove that this problem is NL-complete for the first
representation and PSPACE-complete for the other two. As a conclusion we extend
our results from edge-labeled graphs to vertex-labeled graphs and vertex-edge
labeled graphs.

relationship to the dynamics of billiards within confocal conics. We focus on
the three main issues: A) The case of Pseudo-Euclidean spaces, presenting a
recent notion of relativistic quadrics, and applying it to the description of
periodic trajectories of billiards within quadrics. B) The relationship between
so-called billiard algebra and foundations of modern discrete differential
geometry which leads to the Double-reflection nets. C) We introduce a new class
of dynamical systems -- pseudo-integrable billiards generated by the boundary
composed of several arcs of confocal conics having nonconvex angles. The
dynamics of such billiards has several extraordinary properties. They are
related to the interval exchange transformations and generate families of flows
which are minimal but not uniquely ergodic. This type of dynamics provides a
novel type of the Poncelet porisms -- the local ones.

greater susceptibility to the Galactic tides: the total mass of destroyed GCs

result challenges a recent view that the Milky Way GCs were born compact on the

empirical processes by a sequence of suprema of Gaussian processes, without
taking the route of approximating whole empirical processes in the sup-norm. We
prove an abstract approximation theorem applicable to a wide variety of
statistical problems, such as construction of uniform confidence bands for
functions. Notably, the bound in the main approximation theorem is
nonasymptotic and the theorem allows for functions that index the empirical
process to be unbounded and have entropy divergent with the sample size. The
proof of the approximation theorem builds on a new coupling inequality for
maxima of sums of random vectors, the proof of which depends on an effective
use of Stein's method for normal approximation, and some new empirical process
techniques. We study applications of this approximation theorem to local and
series empirical processes arising in nonparametric estimation via kernel and
series methods, where the classes of functions change with the sample size and
are non-Donsker. Importantly, our new technique is able to prove the Gaussian
approximation for the supremum type statistics under weak regularity
conditions, especially concerning the bandwidth and the number of series
functions, in those examples.

acknowledged that photon recoil forces and torques from the asymmetric
reflection and thermal re-radiation of sunlight are primary mechanisms that
govern the rotational evolution of an asteroid. The
Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect causes changes in the
rotation rate and pole direction of an irregularly shaped asteroid. We present
a simple Monte Carlo method to estimate the range of
YORP-rotational-accelerations acting on a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) without
knowledge of its detailed shape, and to estimate its detectability using
light-curve observations. The method requires knowledge of an asteroid's
orbital properties and size, and assumes that the future observational
circumstances of an asteroid have already been thought through. It is verified
by application to the observational circumstances of the seven
YORP-investigated asteroids, and is then applied to 540 NEAs with NEOWISE
and/or other diameter measurements, and to all NEAs using MPCORB absolute
magnitudes. The YORP-detectability is found to be a strong function of the
combined asteroid orbital and diameter properties, and is independent of the
rotation period for NEAs that don't have very fast or slow rotation rates. The
median and 1-sigma spread of YORP-rotational-acceleration expected to be acting
on a particular NEA can be estimated from its semimajor axis, eccentricity, and
diameter by using (eq. 1) and/or by using (eq. 2) if the diameter is instead
estimated from the absolute magnitude by assuming a geometric albedo of 0.1.
The length of a light-curve observational campaign required to achieve a 50 per
cent probability of detecting the YORP effect in a particular NEA can be
estimated by using (eq. 3) and/or by using (eq. 4) for an

high-dimensional random vectors. Specifically, we establish conditions under
which the distribution of the maximum is approximated by that of the maximum of
a sum of the Gaussian random vectors with the same covariance matrices as the
original vectors. This result applies when the dimension of random vectors
($p$) is large compared to the sample size ($n$); in fact, $p$ can be much
larger than $n$, without restricting correlations of the coordinates of these
vectors. We also show that the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the
random vectors with unknown covariance matrices can be consistently estimated
by the distribution of the maximum of a sum of the conditional Gaussian random
vectors obtained by multiplying the original vectors with i.i.d. Gaussian
multipliers. This is the Gaussian multiplier (or wild) bootstrap procedure.
Here too, $p$ can be large or even much larger than $n$. These distributional
approximations, either Gaussian or conditional Gaussian, yield a high-quality
approximation to the distribution of the original maximum, often with
approximation error decreasing polynomially in the sample size, and hence are
of interest in many applications. We demonstrate how our Gaussian
approximations and the multiplier bootstrap can be used for modern
high-dimensional estimation, multiple hypothesis testing, and adaptive
specification testing. All these results contain nonasymptotic bounds on
approximation errors.

activity with increasing rotation rate. The so-called activity-rotation
relation is usually attributed to changes in the underlying dynamo processes
generating the magnetic field. We examine the dependence of the field strength
on rotation in global numerical dynamo models and interpret our results on the
basis of energy considerations. In agreement with the scaling law proposed by
Christensen & Aubert (2006), the field strength in our simulations is set by
the fraction of the available power used for the magnetic field generation.
This is controlled by the dynamo efficiency calculated as the ratio of Ohmic to
total dissipation in our models. The dynamo efficiency grows strongly with
increasing rotation rate at a Rossby number of 0.1 until it reaches its upper
bound of one and becomes independent of rotation. This gain in efficiency is
related to the strong rotational dependence of the mean electromotive force in
this parameter regime. For multipolar models at Rossby numbers clearly larger
than 0.1, on the other hand, we do not find a systematic dependence of the
field strength on rotation. Whether the enhancement of the dynamo efficiency
found in our dipolar models explains the observed activity-rotation relation
needs to be further assessed.

it into a hydrogen atom, and the crescents into triangles which may have

that the group contains loxodromic elements. Since the domain of such groups is
not the disc, hyperbolic plane geometry cannot be used. Rather, the theory of
the isometric circle is adapted since it treats all groups symmetrically. The
pairing of circles and their inverses is likened to pairing particles with
their antiparticles which then go one to produce nested circles, or a

nonperturbational continued-fraction scheme. Unlike its
representation-independent antecedent, the spin-off scheme only works in
representations where all components of the equation's inhomogeneous term are
nonzero. But that requirement seems to confer theoretical physics robustness
heretofore unknown: for quantum fields the order of the perturbation places a
bound on unperturbed particle number, the spin-off scheme contrariwise has only

difficult to visualize such a continued-fraction spin-off scheme generating

We address the question of Venture Capital investment sensitivity to
performance and prospects of new venture, given as likelihood of obtaining
future financing, available exit options and duration between investment
rounds. We argue that in the case of Internet companies, publicly available
social feedback data, such as search trends and website traffic information,
can be used as a proxy for some of company's internal metrics such as user base
growth and product adoption. In order to answer questions of interest, we
compile unique dataset consisting of detailed information about Venture Capital
investments in the Internet Technology sector over the period from 2004 to 2012
and associated longitudinal search trend and website traffic data. By applying
methods of survival analysis, we find that positive trends in search and
website traffic volumes can lead to increased likelihood of future financing
and shortening of duration between subsequent financing rounds. We also find
evidence that social feedback only impacts company's ability to attract next
round of financing or exit via IPO, while M&A exits seem relatively independent
of such performance metrics and can occur at any stage of company development.
Such findings provide strong evidence in support of learning hypothesis and
suggest VC's ability to identify prospects of new venture early in it's
development and allocate funding accordingly. Given research also provides
methodological contributions to the problem of evaluating the prospects of new
startup companies using only publicly available data, and as such should be of
interest in applications such as new investment screening and industry-level
