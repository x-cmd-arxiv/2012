investigated to gain a further understanding of starburst-driven outflow
activity by XMM-Newton and Suzaku. Spectroscopic analysis for three regions of
the galaxy characterized by multiwavelength observations was conducted. The hot
gas was represented by two thin thermal plasmas with temperatures of kT ~0.2
and ~0.6 keV. Abundance ratios i.e., O/Fe, Ne/Fe, Mg/Fe and Si/Fe, are
consistent between three regions, which suggests the common origin of the hot
gas. The abundance patterns are consistent with those of type II supernova
ejecta, indicating that the starburst activity in the central region provides
metals toward the halo through a galactic-scale starburst-driven outflow. The
energetics also can support this indication on condition that 0.01-50
{\eta}^0.5 % of the total emission in the nuclear region has flowed to the halo
region. To constrain the dynamics of hot interstellar gas, surface brightness
and hardness ratio profiles which trace the density and temperature were
extracted. Assuming a simple polytropic equation of state of gas,
T{\rho}^(1-{\gamma}) = const, we constrained the physical condition. {\gamma}
is consistent with 5/3 at the hot disk and T is constant ({\gamma} = 1) in the
halo. It is suggested that the hot gas expands adiabatically from the central
region towards the halo region while it moves as free expansion from the inner
part of the halo towards the outer part of the halo as the outflow. We
constrained the outflow velocity to be >100 km s^-1 from the observed
temperature gradient in the halo. In comparison with the escape velocity of
~220 km s^-1 for NGC 253, it is indicated that the hot interstellar gas can
escape from the gravitational potential of NGC 253 by combining the outflow
velocity and the thermal velocity.

much about the evolution of genes, genomes, and species, as well as about the
molecular function of genes. A wide array of computational tools have been
devised for this task under certain evolutionary events such as hybridization,
gene duplication/loss, or incomplete lineage sorting. Work on reconciling gene
tree with species phylogenies under two or more of these events have also begun
to emerge. Our group recently devised both parsimony and probabilistic
frameworks for reconciling a gene tree with a phylogenetic network, thus
allowing for the detection of hybridization in the presence of incomplete
lineage sorting. While the frameworks were general and could handle any
topology, they are computationally intensive, rendering their application to
large datasets infeasible. In this paper, we present two novel approaches to
address the computational challenges of the two frameworks that are based on
the concept of ancestral configurations. Our approaches still compute exact
solutions while improving the computational time by up to five orders of
magnitude. These substantial gains in speed scale the applicability of these
unified reconciliation frameworks to much larger data sets. We discuss how the
topological features of the gene tree and phylogenetic network may affect the
performance of the new algorithms. We have implemented the algorithms in our

elegans body wall muscle undergoes a process remarkably reminiscent of human

study the influence of merger processes on the evolution of dust properties and
cosmic star formation rate, we investigate a local sample of major merger
galaxies and a control sample of isolated galaxies using GALEX ultraviolet (UV)
and Spitzer infrared (IR) images. Through a statistical study, we find that
dust attenuation in merger galaxies is enhanced with respect to isolated
galaxies. We find this enhancement is contributed mainly by spiral galaxies in
spiral-spiral (S-S) pairs, and increases with the increasing stellar mass of a
galaxy. Combining the IR and UV parts of star formation rates (SFRs), we then
calculated the total SFRs and specific star formation rates (SSFRs). We find
the SSFRs to be enhanced in merger galaxies. This enhancement depends on galaxy
stellar mass and the companion's morphology, but depends little on whether the
galaxy is a primary or secondary component or on the separation between two
components. These results are consistent with a previous study based only on IR
images. In addition, we investigate the nuclear contributions to SFRs. SFRs in
paired galaxies are more concentrated in the central part of the galaxies than
in isolate galaxies. Our studies of dust attenuation show that the nuclear
parts of pairs most resemble ULIRGs. Including UV data in the present work not
only provides reliable information on dust attenuation, but also refines
analyses of SFRs.

by the linear dispersion relation for waves, as a result direct measurement of
the dispersion relation in the presence of condensate is necessary. We
performed the measurement of this dispersion relation from the direct numerical
experiment. The results demonstrate that in the region of inverse cascade
influence of the condensate cannot be neglected.

  Results: Fractal dimension based comparative analyses of various biophysical
properties of Ras superfamily proteins were conducted. Though the extent of
sequence and functional overlapping across Ras superfamily structures is
extremely high, results obtained from ProtFract investigation are found to be
sensitive to detect differences in the distribution of each of the properties.
For example, it was found that the RAN proteins are structurally most stable
amongst all Ras superfamily proteins, the ARFs possess maximum extent of unused
hydrophobicity in their structures, RAB protein interiors have
electrostatically least conducive environment, GEM/REM/RAD proteins possess
exceptionally high symmetry in the structural organization of their active
chiral centres, neither hydrophobicity nor columbic interactions play
significant part in stabilizing the RAS proteins but aromatic interactions do,
though cation-pi interactions are found to be more dominant in RAN than in RAS
proteins. Ras superfamily proteins can best be classified with respect to their
class-specific pi-pi and cation-pi interaction symmetries.

makes a wiki into a powerful environment for collaborating on
publication-quality manuscripts and software projects. Developed in Jonathan
Dushoff's theoretical biology lab at McMaster University and available as free
software, it allows wiki users to work together on anything that can be done by
using UNIX commands to transform textual ""source code"" into output. Researchers
can use it to collaborate on programs written in R, python, C, or any other
language, and there are special features to support easy work on LaTeX
documents. It develops the potential of the wiki medium to serve as a
combination collaborative text editor, development environment, revision
control system, and publishing platform. Its potential uses are open-ended -
its processing is controlled by makefiles that are straightforward to customize
- and its modular design is intended to allow parts of it to be adapted to
other purposes.

rectangular holes in gold films are explored. Using electron energy loss
spectroscopy combined with scanning transmission electron microscopy, a series
of cavity standing waves is resolved, indicating particularly high interslit
interactions, about an order of magnitude larger than the intra-slit edge to
edge coupling. Pronounced signal enhancements are thus induced, dominated by
short-range interactions and high mode-localization, while yet, relatively
long-range coherence is retained. The sub-nm electron beam, in spite of
principal differences from broad-area probes, yields results similar to
extraordinary optical transmission (EOT). Implications to EOT mechanisms,
including its sub-wavelength, off-resonance limit, are pointed out.

calculations of the magneto-optical response is presented. We apply the
formalism to the case of ordinary and gapped graphene in a next-nearest

For such a sequence of grids, the solver delivers linear computational cost

The linear computational cost is achieved by utilizing the recursive structure
provided by the sequence of h-adaptive grids with a special construction of the
elimination tree that allows for reutilization of previously computed partial
LU factorizations over the entire unrefined part of the computational mesh. The
reutilization technique reduces the computational cost of the entire sequence

from the Galactic center source-Sgr A* can be naturally explained by the hybrid
of thermal and nonthermal electrons in hot accretion flows (e.g., radiatively
inefficient accretion flow, RIAF, e.g., Yuan et al. 2003). We further apply
this model to a sample of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei
(LLAGNs), which are also believed to be powered by the RIAF. We selected the
LLAGNs with only compact radio cores according to the high-resolution radio
observations, and the sources observed with jets or jet-like features are
excluded. We find that the radio emission of LLAGNs is severely underpredicted
by pure RIAF model, and can be naturally explained by the RIAF model with a
hybrid electron population consisting of both thermal and nonthermal particles.
Our model can roughly reproduce the observed anti-correlation between the
mass-corrected radio loudness and Eddington ratio for the LLAGNs in our sample.
We further model the spectral energy distributions of each source in our
sample, and find that roughly all sources can be well fitted if a small
fraction of the steady state electron energy is ejected into the nonthermal
electrons. The size of radio emission region of our model is around several
thousand gravitational radii, which is also roughly consistent with the recent
high-resolution VLBI observations for some nearby LLAGNs.

Bayesian statistics to analyse data from a generic counting experiment and
apply it to the search for neutrinos from point sources. We discuss a test
statistic defined following a Bayesian framework that will be used in the
search for a signal. In case no signal is found, we derive an upper limit
without the introduction of approximations. The Bayesian approach allows us to
obtain the full probability density function for both the background and the
signal rate. As such, we have direct access to any signal upper limit. The
upper limit derivation directly compares with a frequentist approach and is
robust in the case of low-counting observations. Furthermore, it allows also to
account for previous upper limits obtained by other analyses via the concept of
prior information without the need of the ad hoc application of trial factors.
To investigate the validity of the presented Bayesian approach, we have applied
this method to the public IceCube 40-string configuration data for 10 nearby
blazars and we have obtained a flux upper limit, which is in agreement with the
upper limits determined via a frequentist approach. Furthermore, the upper
limit obtained compares well with the previously published result of IceCube,
using the same data set.

expected to begin detonating, the fractions of mass expelled by ionizing
feedback is a very strong function of the cloud escape velocities. High-mass
clouds are largely unaffected dynamically, while lower-mass clouds have large
fractions of their gas reserves expelled on this timescale. However, the
fractions of stellar mass unbound are modest and significant portions of the
unbound stars are so only because the clouds themselves are initially partially
unbound. We find that ionization is much more able to create well-cleared
bubbles in the unbound clouds, owing to their intrinsic expansion, but that the
presence of such bubbles does not necessarily indicate that a given cloud has
been strongly influenced by feedback. We also find, in common with the bound
clouds from our earlier work, that many of the systems simulated here are
highly porous to photons and supernova ejecta, and that most of them will
likely survive their first supernova explosions.

process of the glass transition. It remains poorly understood due to the
disorder leading to nontrivial (nonaffine) components in the atomic

only a negligible role. It predicts the square-root vanishing of the shear
modulus $G\sim\sqrt{T_{c}-T}$ at criticality observed in the most recent

method to study flow through microchannels due to the ease with which the
presence of biological cells or DNA chains can be modeled. Many Lab-On-Chip
(LOC) devices require the ability to manipulate the transport of cells or DNA
chains in the fluid flow. Microchannel surfaces coated with combinations of
hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials have been found useful for this purpose.
In this work, we have numerically studied the hydrodynamics of a steady
nonuniform developing flow between two infinite parallel plates with
hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces using DPD for the first time. The
hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces were modeled using partial-slip and
no-slip boundary conditions respectively in the simulations. We also propose a
new method to model the inflow and outflow boundaries for the DPD simulations.
The simulation results of the developing flow match analytical solutions from
continuum theory for no-slip and partial-slip surfaces to good accord.
  The entrance region constitutes a considerable fraction of the channel length
in miniaturized devices. Thus it is desirable for the length of the developing
region to be short as most microfluidic devices such as cell or DNA separators
and mixers are designed for the developed flow field. We studied the effect of
a hydrophilic strip near the inlet of a microchannel on the effective
developing length. We find that the presence of the hydrophobic strip
significantly reduces the developing length.

the nitrogen partial pressure during growth. By patterning optimum 4nm and 22nm
thick films into a 100nm wide, 369\mu m long nanowire meander using electron
beam lithography and reactive ion etching, we fabricated single photon
detectors on GaAs substrates. Time-resolved studies of the photo-response,

of a photo-generated hotspot is estimated to be 30\pm8nm, clearly identifying
the low detection efficiency and dark count rate of the thick film detectors as
arising from hotspot cooling via the heat reservoir provided by the NbN film.

and SS) of BH binaries could be caused by kinetic processes and changing
because of varying physical conditions in the corona. In presence of a magnetic
field in the corona, the electron distribution can appear thermal, even when
acceleration mechanisms would produce non thermal distributions. This is due to
fast and efficient thermalization through synchrotron self-absorption. We have
analyzed data from 6 years of observations of Cygnus X-1 with the INTEGRAL
observatory and produced 12 high-quality, stacked broad-band hard X-ray spectra
representative of the whole range of spectral shapes observed. We then fit
these spectra with hybrid thermal/non-thermal Comptonization models and study
the evolution of the physical parameters of the accretion flow across the
spectral transition. In particular, we use the BELM model to constrain the
magnetic field in the corona through its effects on the coronal emission.
Indeed, the hot electrons of the X-ray corona produce soft (optical-UV)
synchrotron radiation which is then Comptonized and may affect the temperature
of the electrons through Compton cooling. We find that in the SS, the emission
is dominated by Comptonization of the disc photons and the magnetic field is at
most of the order of 1E+06 G. In the hard states, the data are consistent with
a pure synchrotron self-Compton model. If the non-thermal excess observed above
a few hundred keV in the HS is produced in the same region as the bulk of the
thermal Comptonization, we obtain an upper limit on the coronal magnetic field
of about 1E+05 G. If, on the other hand, the non-thermal excess is produced in
a different location, the constraints on the magnetic field in the HS are
somewhat relaxed and the upper limit rises to 1E+07 G. We discuss these
constraints in the context of current accretion flow models.

central to all applications of laser light. We obtain the ultimate quantum
limit on the error probability exponent for discriminating among any M
multimode coherent-state waveforms via the quantum Chernoff exponent in M-ary
multi-copy state discrimination. A receiver, i.e., a concrete realization of a
quantum measurement, called the Sequential Waveform Nulling (SWN) receiver, is
proposed for discriminating an arbitrary coherent-state ensemble using only
auxiliary coherent-state fields, beam splitters, and non-number-resolving
single photon detectors. An explicit error probability analysis of the SWN
receiver is used to show that it achieves the quantum limit on the error
probability exponent, which is shown to be a factor of four greater than the
error probability exponent of an ideal heterodyne-detection receiver on the
same ensemble. We generalize the philosophy of the SWN receiver, which is
itself adapted from some existing coherent-state receivers, and propose a
receiver -- the Sequential Testing (ST) receiver-- for discriminating n copies
of M pure quantum states from an arbitrary Hilbert space. The ST receiver is
shown to achieve the quantum Chernoff exponent in the limit of a large number
of copies, and is remarkable in requiring only local operations and classical
communication (LOCC) to do so. In particular, it performs adaptive copy-by-copy
binary projective measurements. Apart from being of fundamental interest, these
results are relevant to communication, sensing, and imaging systems that use
laser light and to photonic implementations of quantum information processing
protocols in general.

Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) method. In principle, this approach takes into
account Pauli effects and pairing correlations while other correlation effects
are mimicked through the use of effective density-dependent interactions.
  Purpose: Investigate the influence of higher order correlation effects on
nuclear binding energies using Skyrme's effective interaction.
  Methods: A cut-off in relative momenta is introduced in order to remove
ultraviolet divergences caused by the zero-range character of the interaction.
Corrections to binding energies are then calculated using the
quasiparticle-random-phase approximation (QRPA) and second order many-body
perturbation theory (MBPT2).
  Result: Contributions to the correlation energies are evaluated for several
isotopic chains and an attempt is made to disentangle which parts give rise to
fluctuations that may be difficult to incorporate on the HFB level. The
dependence of the results on the cut-off is also investigated.
  Conclusions: The improved interaction allows explicit summations of
perturbation series which is useful for the description of some nuclear
observables. However, refits of the interaction parameters are needed to obtain
more quantitative results.

the classical model of self-propelled particles to the case where particles
after the collision tend to move in slightly different directions away from
each other, as characterized by a collision angle $\alpha$. We map out the
resulting phase diagram and find that, in sufficiently dense systems, small
disalignment can lead to higher global alignment of particle movement
directions. We show that in this dense regime, global alignment is accompanied
by a grid-like spatial structure which allows information to rapidly percolate

Basically, cryptography shuffles data so that they become unreadable by

very existence of the message using steganography. Fundamentally, steganography
conceals secret data into innocent-looking mediums called carriers which can
then travel from the sender to the receiver safe and unnoticed. This paper
proposes a novel steganography scheme for hiding digital data into uncompressed

the proposed scheme uses two mediums to deliver the secret data: a carrier
image into which the secret data are hidden into random pixels, and a
well-structured English text that encodes the location of the random carrier
pixels. The English text is generated at runtime using a context-free grammar
coupled with a lexicon of English words. The proposed scheme is stealthy, and
hard to be noticed, detected, and recovered. Experiments conducted showed how
the covering and the uncovering processes of the proposed scheme work. As
future work, a semantic analyzer is to be developed so as to make the English
text medium semantically correct, and consequently safer to be transmitted

safely transmit digital data. Nevertheless, they do differ in important ways.
In fact, cryptography scrambles data so that they become unreadable by
eavesdroppers; while, steganography hides the very existence of data so that
they can be transferred unnoticed. Basically, steganography is a technique for
hiding data such as messages into another form of data such as images.
Currently, many types of steganography are in use; however, there is yet no
known steganography application for query languages such as SQL. This paper
proposes a new steganography method for textual data. It encodes input text
messages into SQL carriers made up of SELECT queries. In effect, the output SQL
carrier is dynamically generated out of the input message using a dictionary of
words implemented as a hash table and organized into 65 categories, each of
which represents a particular character in the language. Generally speaking,
every character in the message to hide is mapped to a random word from a
corresponding category in the dictionary. Eventually, all input characters are
transformed into output words which are then put together to form an SQL query.
Experiments conducted, showed how the proposed method can operate on real
examples proving the theory behind it. As future work, other types of SQL
queries are to be researched including INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE queries,
making the SQL carrier quite puzzling for malicious third parties to recuperate
the secret message that it encodes.

circuit QED, this model is implemented by combining microwave resonators and
superconducting qubits on a microchip with unprecedented experimental control.
Arranging qubits and resonators in the form of a lattice realizes a new kind of
Hubbard model, the Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard model, in which the elementary
excitations are polariton quasi-particles. Due to the genuine openness of
photonic systems, circuit QED lattices offer the possibility to study the
intricate interplay of collective behavior, strong correlations and
non-equilibrium physics. Thus, turning circuit QED into an architecture for
quantum simulation, i.e., using a well-controlled system to mimic the intricate
quantum behavior of another system too daunting for a theorist to tackle
head-on, is an exciting idea which has served as theorists' playground for a
while and is now also starting to catch on in experiments. This review gives a
summary of the most recent theoretical proposals and experimental efforts in
this context.

and information. These databases are useful for conducting daily business
transactions. However, the tight competition in the marketplace has led to the
concept of data mining in which data are analyzed to derive effective business
strategies and discover better ways in carrying out business. In order to
perform data mining, regular databases must be converted into what so called
informational databases also known as data warehouse. This paper presents a
design model for building data warehouse for a typical university information
system. It is based on transforming an operational database into an
informational warehouse useful for decision makers to conduct data analysis,
predication, and forecasting. The proposed model is based on four stages of
data migration: Data extraction, data cleansing, data transforming, and data
indexing and loading. The complete system is implemented under MS Access 2010
and is meant to serve as a repository of data for data mining operations.

X-shaped radio sources. According to one of them, an X-shaped source is indeed
a cross whose one arm is associated with a double radio source that has changed
its orientation in space, while the other arm is associated with relic lobes
and its position indicates the former direction of the jets. Here, I present
two new arguments in favour of this conjecture. Firstly, it is obvious that
shortly after the repositioning, the pair of the new lobes must be very
compact. To illustrate such a possibility, I show an EVN image of the central
component of a triple source J1625+2712. When resolved, it appears as a compact
double that is not aligned with the outer double so the whole source is indeed
X-shaped. Secondly, I consider the situation when one of the arms of an
X-shaped source is not intrinsically short but foreshortened by projection. I
show two examples of triple sources whose central component is a blazar and the
span of the lobes that straddle it amounts to more than 6\times10^5 pc. An
assumption that sources of this kind have one axis, and so the lobes are beamed
in the same way the core is, would require unrealistically huge deprojected
linear sizes. Therefore, I claim that core-dominated triples (CDT) like these
two have two axes: the one pertinent to the relic lobes is not pointed towards
us so they are not beamed/foreshortened, whereas the axis pertinent to the jets
makes a small angle with the line of sight so that a blazar is observed. It
follows that X-shaped sources must be actual crosses and they are the parent
(unbeamed) population of at least some CDT blazars, particularly those with
large overall sizes.

environment. Quantifying the maximum possible energy of solar flares of the
present-day Sun, if any, is thus a key question in heliophysics. The largest
solar flares observed over the past few decades have reached energies of a few
times 10^{32} ergs, possibly up to 10^{33} ergs. Flares in active Sun-like
stars reach up to about 10^{36} ergs. In the absence of direct observations of
solar flares within this range, complementary methods of investigation are
needed. Using historical reports for solar active region, we scaled to observed
solar values a realistic dimensionless 3D MHD simulation for eruptive flares,
which originate from a highly sheared bipole. This enabled us to calculate the
magnetic fluxes and flare energies in the model in a wide paramater space.
Firstly, commonly observed solar conditions lead to modeled magnetic fluxes and
flare energies that are comparable to those estimated from observations.
Secondly, we evaluate from observations that 30% of the area of sunspot groups
are typically involved in flares. This is related to the strong fragmentation
of these groups, which naturally results from sub-photospheric convection. When
the model is scaled to 30% of the area of the largest sunspot group ever
reported, with its peak magnetic field being set to the strongest value ever
measured in a sunspot, it produces a flare with a maximum energy of ~ 6x10^{33}
ergs. The results of the model suggest that the Sun is able to produce flares
up to about six times as energetic in total solar irradiance fluence as the
strongest directly-observed flare from Nov 4, 2003. Sunspot groups larger than
historically reported would yield superflares for spot pairs that would exceed
tens of degrees in extent. We thus conjecture that superflare-productive
Sun-like stars should have a much stronger dynamo than in the Sun.

nodes under SINR requirements. This problem is of special interest in dynamic
spectrum access networks where topology and spectral resources differ with time
and location. The problem is to determine the number of radio nodes that can
transmit simultaneously while still achieving their SINR requirements and then
decide which channels these nodes should transmit on. Previous work have shown
how this can be done for a large spectrum pool where nodes allocate multiple
channels from that pool which renders a linear programming approach feasible
when the pool is large enough. In this paper we extend their work by
considering arbitrary individual pool sizes and allow nodes to only transmit on
one channel. Due to the accumulative nature of interference this problem is a
non-convex integer problem which is NP-hard. However, we introduce a constraint
transformation that transforms the problem to a binary quadratic constraint
problem. Although this problem is still NP-hard, well known heuristic
algorithms for solving this problem are known in the literature. We implement a
heuristic algorithm based on Lagrange relaxation which bounds the solution
value of the heuristic to the optimal value of the constraint transformed
problem. Simulation results show that this approach provides solutions within
an average gap of 10% of solutions obtained by a genetic algorithm for the
original non-convex integer problem.

anisotropy on the onset of magnetic reconnection by means of 2-D hybrid
simulations. The collisionless tearing of a current sheet is studied in the
presence of a proton temperature anisotropy in the surrounding plasma. Our
results confirm that anisotropic protons within the current sheet region can
significantly enhance/stabilize the tearing instability of the current.
Moreover, fluctuations associated to linear instabilities excited by large
proton temperature anisotropies can significantly influence the stability of
the plasma and perturb the current sheets, triggering the tearing instability.
We find that such a complex coupling leads to a faster tearing evolution in a
regime with larger perpendicular temperature when an ion-cyclotron instability
is generated by the anisotropic proton distribution functions. On the contrary,
in the presence of the opposite anisotropy, fire hose fluctuations excited by
the unstable background protons with larger parallel temperature are not able
to efficiently destabilize the current sheets, which remain stable for a long
time after fire hose saturation. We discuss possible influences of this novel
coupling on the solar wind and heliospheric plasma dynamics.

our Berry phase vanishes, modulo $2\pi$, as expected. Although, our Berry phase
is in general complex, it becomes real in the expected cases: the adiabatic
limit, the extreme non-adiabatic limit, and the points at which the state of
the system returns to its initial form, up to a phase factor. Therefore, this

driven IT industries to pay special consideration to data confidentiality. At
present, two main techniques are being used: Cryptography and Steganography. In
effect, cryptography garbles a secret message turning it into a meaningless
form; while, steganography hides the very existence of the message by embedding
it into an intermediate such as a computer file. In fact, in audio
steganography, this computer file is a digital audio file in which secret data
are concealed, predominantly, into the bits that make up its audio samples.
This paper proposes a novel steganography technique for hiding digital data
into uncompressed audio files using a randomized algorithm and a context-free
grammar coupled with a lexicon of words. Furthermore, the proposed technique
uses two intermediates to transmit the secret data between communicating
parties: The first intermediate is an audio file whose audio samples, which are
selected randomly, are used to conceal the secret data; whereas, the second
intermediate is a grammatically correct English text that is generated at
runtime using a context-free grammar and it encodes the location of the random
audio samples in the audio file. The proposed technique is stealthy and
irrecoverable in a sense that it is difficult for unauthorized third parties to
detect the presence of and recover the secret data. Experiments conducted
showed how the covering and the uncovering processes of the proposed technique
work. As future work, a semantic analyzer is to be developed so as to make the
intermediate text not only grammatically correct but also semantically
plausible.

conventional matter, of dark matter and of dark energy may be successfully
described and treated in the framework of the Weyl-Dirac theory. This theory,
being a minimal expansion of Einstein's GRT, contains in addition to the metric
tensor\g, the Weyl connection vector \w and the Dirac gauge function\beta. From
these geometrically based quantities one obtains the behavior of our universe.
The Weyl connection vector \w existing in microcells creates dark matter
particles, weylons. In the very early universe \beta creates matter, whereas in
the present dust period \beta forms dark energy, the latter causing cosmic
acceleration. Around a massive body the - dark energy form a ball-like
concentration having negative mass and negative pressure. These \beta-balls
cause an additional acceleration of the expanding universe. The Weyl-Dirac
theory is a classical geometrically based framework appropriate for describing
and searching cosmology.

that all causation flows in a bottom up fashion, from micro to macro scales.
However this is wrong in many cases in biology, and in particular in the way
the brain functions. Here I make the case that it is also wrong in the case of
digital computers - the paradigm of mechanistic algorithmic causation - and in
many cases in physics, ranging from the origin of the arrow of time to the
process of state vector preparation. I consider some examples from classical
physics, as well as the case of digital computers, and then explain why this is
possible without contradicting the causal powers of the underlying
microphysics. Understanding the emergence of genuine complexity out of the
underlying physics depends on recognising this kind of causation.

sigma and pion exchanges. The effective mesonic potential is extended to the
finite temperature and it is numerically calculated using n-midpoint rule.
Meson properties such as the phase transition, the sigma and pion masses, and
the critical point temperature are examined as functions of temperature. The
obtained results are compared with other approaches. We conclude that the
calculated effective potential is successfully to predict the meson properties

using geometric concepts. The scale is variable depending on the gravitational
potential and the trajectory inclination with respect to the field direction.
The proposed neutrino covariant equation provides the adequate curvature. The
mass-energy at the Earth surface varies from a horizontal value 0.402 eV to a
vertical value 0.569 eV. Earth spinor waves with winding numbers n show squared
energy differences within ranges from 2.05 x 10*(-3) to 4.10 x 10*(-3) eV*2 for
n=0,1 neutrinos and from 3.89 x 10*(-5) to 7.79 x 10*(-5) eV*2 for n=1,2
neutrinos. These waves interfere and the different phase velocities produce
neutrino-like oscillations. The experimental results for atmospheric and solar
neutrino oscillation mass parameters respectivelly fall within these
theoretical ranges. Neutrinos in outer space, where interactions may be
neglected, appear as particles travelling with zero mass on null geodesics.
These gravitational curvature energies are consistent with neutrino
oscillations, zero neutrino rest masses and Einstein's General Relativity and
energy mass equivalence principle. When analyzing or averaging experimental
neutrino mass-energy results of different experiments on the Earth it is of
interest to consider the possible influence of the trajectory inclination
angle.
