fast-rotating stars are computed with the actual baroclinic flows that predict
the differential rotation and the meridional circulation for intermediate-mass

nearby fast-rotating early-type stars like Ras Alhague ($\alpha$ Oph), Regulus
($\alpha$ Leo), and Vega ($\alpha$ Lyr). It is shown that baroclinicity drives
a differential rotation with a slow pole, a fast equator, a fast core, and a
slow envelope. The differential rotation is found to increase with mass, with
evolution (here measured by the hydrogen mass fraction in the core), and with
metallicity. The core-envelope interface is found to be a place of strong shear
where mixing will be efficient.Two-dimensional models offer a new view of
fast-rotating stars, especially of their differential rotation, which turns out
to be strong at the core-envelope interface. They also offer more accurate
models for interpreting the interferometric and spectroscopic data of

inversion codes of the radiative transfer equation to retrieve the magnetic
field vector at each spatial point on the solar surface and studying the
resulting distribution of the magnetic field vector, we surmised a theoretical
distribution function of the magnetic field vector and used it to obtain the
theoretical histograms of the Stokes profiles. These histograms were then
compared to the observed ones. Any mismatch between them was ascribed to the
theoretical distribution of the magnetic field vector, which was subsequently
modified to produce a better fit to the observed histograms. With this method
we find that Stokes profiles with signals above $2\times 10^{-3}$ (in units of
the continuum intensity) cannot be explained by an isotropic distribution of
the magnetic field vector. We also find that the differences between the
histograms of the Stokes profiles observed at different latitudes cannot be
explained in terms of line-of-sight effects. However, they can be explained by
a distribution of the magnetic field vector that inherently varies with

  the version that is accepted for publication in Journal of Evolutionary
  Biology",,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The evolution of parasite virulence and host defences is affected by
population structure. This effect has been confirmed in studies focusing on
large spatial scales, whereas the importance of local structure is not well
understood. Slavemaking ants are social parasites that exploit workers of
another species to rear their offspring. Enslaved workers of the host species
Temnothorax longispinosus have been found to exhibit an effective
post-enslavement defence behaviour: enslaved workers were observed killing a
large proportion of the parasites' offspring. Since enslaved workers do not
reproduce, they gain no direct fitness benefit from this 'rebellion' behaviour.
However, there may be an indirect benefit: neighbouring host nests that are
related to 'rebel' nests can benefit from a reduced raiding pressure, as a
result of the reduction in parasite nest size due to the enslaved workers'
killing behaviour. We use a simple mathematical model to examine whether the
small-scale population structure of the host species could explain the
evolution of this potentially altruistic defence trait against slavemaking
ants. We find that this is the case if enslaved host workers are related to
nearby host nests. In a population genetic study we confirm that enslaved
workers are, indeed, more closely related to host nests within the raiding
range of their resident slavemaker nest, than to host nests outside the raiding
range. This small-scale population structure seems to be a result of polydomy
(e.g. the occupation of several nests in close proximity by a single colony)
and could have enabled the evolution of 'rebellion' by kin selection.

Submillimeter Array (SMA) at angular resolutions of about 0.5""-3"". The SMA
observations show that the MonR2-IRS2 source is very compact and remains
unresolved at spatial scales <=400AU. Its continuum power spectrum at
millimeter wavelengths is almost flat (alpha=-0.16, with S_nu proportional to
nu^alpha), indicating that this source is dominated by optically thin free-free
emission. The H30a and H26a RRL emission is also compact and peaks toward the
position of the MonR2-IRS2 source. The measured RRL profiles are double-peaked
with the H26a line showing a clear asymmetry in its spectrum. Since the derived
line-to-continuum flux ratios (80 and 180kms-1 for H30a and H26a, respectively)
exceed the LTE predictions, the RRLs toward MonR2-IRS2 are affected by maser
amplification. The amplification factors are however smaller than those found
toward the emission line star MWC349A, indicating that MonR2-IRS2 is a weakly
amplified maser. Radiative transfer modelling of the RRL emission toward this
source shows that the RRL masers arise from a dense and collimated jet embedded

Frequently, parameters are extracted by performing time-averages on single
particle trajectories followed by ensemble averaging. This procedure however,
suffers from two systematic errors when applied to particles that perform
anomalous diffusion. The first is significant at short time lags and is induced
by measurement errors. The second arises from the natural heterogeneity in
biophysical systems. We show how to estimate and correct these two errors and
improve the estimation of the anomalous parameters for the whole particle
distribution. As a consequence we manage to characterize ensembles of
heterogeneous particles even for rather short and noisy measurements where
regular time averaged mean square displacement analysis fails. We apply this
method to both simulations and in vivo measurements of telomere diffusion in
3T3 mouse embryonic fibroblast cells. The motion of telomeres is found to be
subdiffusive with an average exponent constant in time. Individual telomere
exponents are normally distributed around the average exponent. The proposed
methodology has the potential to improve experimental accuracy while

complexity. The presence of a duplicate removes the constraint of natural
selection upon the gene, leading to its likely loss of function or,
occasionally, the gain of a novel one. Alternately, a pleiotropic gene might
partition its functions among its duplicates, thus preserving both copies.
Duplicate genes is not a novelty for diploid genotypes, but only for
haplotypes. In this paper, we study the consequences of regulatory interactions
in diploid genotypes and explore how the context of allelic interactions gives
rise to dynamical phenotypes that enable duplicate genes to spread in a
population. The regulatory network we study is that of a single autoregulatory
activator gene, and the two copies of the gene diverge either as alleles in a
diploid species or as duplicates in haploids. These differences are in their
transcriptional ability -- either via alterations to its activating domain, or
to its cis-regulatory binding repertoire. When cis-regulatory changes are
introduced that partition multiple regulatory triggers among the duplicates, it
is shown that mutually exclusive expression states of the duplicates that
emerge are accompanied by a back-up facility: when a highly expressed gene is
deleted, the previously unexpressed duplicate copy compensates for it. The
diploid version of the regulatory network model can account for allele-specific
expression variants, and a model of inheritance of the haplotype network
enables us to trace the evolutionary consequence of heterozygous phenotypes.
This is modelled for the variations in the activating domain of one copy,
whereby stable as well as transiently bursting oscillations ensue in single
cells. The evolutionary model shows that these phenotypic states accessible to
a diploid, heterozygous genotype enable the spread of a duplicated haplotype.

potentially introduce appreciable bias in the deduced values of cosmological
parameters. While it is commonly assumed that these uncertainties will be
accounted for to a sufficient level of precision, the level of bias has not
been properly quantified in most cases of interest. We show that the
requirement that the bias in derived values of cosmological parameters does not
surpass nominal statistical error, translates into a maximal level of overall
error $O(N^{-1/2})$ on $|\Delta P(k)|/P(k)$ and $|\Delta C_{l}|/C_{l}$, where
$P(k)$, $C_{l}$, and $N$ are the matter power spectrum, angular power spectrum,
and number of (independent Fourier) modes at a given scale $l$ or $k$ probed by
the cosmological survey, respectively. This required level has important
consequences on the precision with which cosmological parameters are hoped to
be determined by future surveys: In virtually all ongoing and near future
surveys $N$ typically falls in the range $10^{6}-10^{9}$, implying that the
required overall theoretical modeling and numerical precision is already very
high. Future redshifted-21-cm observations, projected to sample $\sim 10^{14}$
modes, will require knowledge of the matter power spectrum to a fantastic
$10^{-7}$ precision level. We conclude that realizing the expected potential of
future cosmological surveys, which aim at detecting $10^{6}-10^{14}$ modes,
sets the formidable challenge of reducing the overall level of uncertainty to
$10^{-3}-10^{-7}$.

to measure the ionization created in a 10x10x10-cm3 PMMA phantom for depths

was determined using a NaI detector to make scattering measurements of the beam
from a thin polyethylene target at angles 30 degrees to 60 degrees.
Differential Compton and Rayleigh scattering cross sections obtained from
xraylib, an ANSI C library for x-ray-matter interactions, were applied to
derive the incident fluence. MCNP5 simulations of the irradiation geometry
provided the dose deposition per photon fluence as a function of depth in the
phantom. At 25 keV the fluence-normalized MCNP5 dose overestimated the
ion-chamber measured dose by an average of 7.2+/-3.0% to 2.1+/-3.0% for PMMA

optimizing the figure-of-merit of thermoelectric materials. Traditionally, when
deriving the phonon mediated thermal conductivity $\kappa_{ph} = \kappa -
\kappa_{el}$ from the measured total thermal conductivity $\kappa$ the constant
Lorenz number $L_0$ of the Wiedemann-Franz law \mbox{$\mathbf{\kappa_{el}}=T
L_0 \sigma$} is chosen. The present study demonstrates that this procedure is
not reliable when the Seebeck coefficient $|S|$ becomes large which is exactly
the case for a thermoelectric material of interest. Another approximation using
$L_0-S^2$, which seem to work better for medium values of $S^2$ also fails when
$S^2$ becomes large, as is the case when the system becomes
semiconducting/insulating. For a reliable estimation of $\kappa_{el}$ it is
proposed, that a full first-principles calculations by combining density
functional theory with Boltzmann's transport theory has to be made. For the
present study such an approach was chosen for investigating the clathrate
type-I compound Ba$_8$Au$_{6-x}$Ge$_{40+x}$ for a series of dopings or
compositions $x$. For a doping of $0.8$ electrons corresponding to $x=0.27$ the
calculated temperature dependent Seebeck coefficient agrees well with recent

approach.

was within 3% of unity for all three monochromatic x-ray beams. EBT and EBT2
film sensitivity showed strong energy dependence over an energy range of 25 keV
- 4 MV, although this dependence becomes weaker for larger doses. EBT3 film
shows weak energy dependence, indicating that it would be a better dosimeter
for kV x-ray beams where beam hardening effects can result in large changes in
the effective energy.

divergence form elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic equations with arbitrary
rough ($L^\infty$) coefficients. Our method does not rely on concepts of
ergodicity or scale-separation but on compactness properties of the solution
space and a new variational approach to homogenization. The approximation space
is generated by an interpolation basis (over scattered points forming a mesh of
resolution $H$) minimizing the $L^2$ norm of the source terms; its
(pre-)computation involves minimizing $\mathcal{O}(H^{-d})$ quadratic (cell)
problems on (super-)localized sub-domains of size $\mathcal{O}(H \ln (1/ H))$.
The resulting localized linear systems remain sparse and banded. The resulting
interpolation basis functions are biharmonic for $d\leq 3$, and polyharmonic
for $d\geq 4$, for the operator $-\diiv(a\nabla \cdot)$ and can be seen as a
generalization of polyharmonic splines to differential operators with arbitrary
rough coefficients. The accuracy of the method ($\mathcal{O}(H)$ in energy norm
and independent from aspect ratios of the mesh formed by the scattered points)
is established via the introduction of a new class of higher-order Poincar\'{e}
inequalities. The method bypasses (pre-)computations on the full domain and
naturally generalizes to time dependent problems, it also provides a natural
solution to the inverse problem of recovering the solution of a divergence form
elliptic equation from a finite number of point measurements.

superconductor-insulator-superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor (SIS'FS)

properties of SIS'FS junctions fall into two distinct classes based on the
thickness of S' layer. We fabricate Nb-Al/AlOx-Nb-PdFe-Nb SIS'FS MJJs using a
co-processing approach with a combination of HYPRES and ISSP fabrication
processes. The resultant SIS'FS structure with thin superconducting S'-layer is
substantially affected by the ferromagnetic layer as a whole. We fabricate
these type of junctions to reach the device compatibility with conventional SIS
junctions used for superconducting SFQ electronics to ensure a seamless
integration of MJJ-based circuits and SIS JJ-based ultra-fast digital SFQ
circuits. We report experimental results for MJJs, demonstrating their
applicability for superconducting memory and digital circuits. These MJJs
exhibit IcRn product only ~30% lower than that of conventional SIS junctions
co-produced in the same fabrication. Analytical calculations for these SIS'FS
structures are in a good agreement with the experiment. We discuss application
of MJJ devices for memory and programmable logic circuits.

to the gravitational forces exerted by a pointlike planet. The main result is
that, if all the deformations of the satellite dissipate some energy, then
under a suitable nondegeneracy condition there are only three possible outcomes
for the dynamics: (i) the orbit of the satellite is unbounded, (ii) the
satellite falls on the planet, (iii) the satellite is captured in synchronous
resonance i.e. its orbit is asymptotic to a motion in which the barycenter
moves on a circular orbit, and the satellite moves rigidly, always showing the
same face to the planet. The result is obtained by making use of LaSalle's
invariance principle and by a careful kinematic analysis showing that energy
stops dissipating only on synchronous orbits. We also use in quite an extensive
way the fact that conservative elastodynamics is a Hamiltonian system invariant
under the action of the rotation group.

$\COH$, is implied by the stable form of Ramsey's theorem for pairs,
$\SRT^2_2$, in $\omega$-models of $\RCA$. One typical way of establishing this
implication would be to show that for every sequence $\vec{R}$ of subsets of
$\omega$, there is a set $A$ that is $\Delta^0_2$ in $\vec{R}$ such that every
infinite subset of $A$ or $\bar{A}$ computes an $\vec{R}$-cohesive set. In this
article, this is shown to be false, even under far less stringent assumptions:
for all natural numbers $n \geq 2$ and $m < 2^n$, there is a sequence $\vec{R}
= \sequence{R_0,...,R_{n-1}}$ of subsets of $\omega$ such that for any
partition $A_0,...,A_{m-1}$ of $\omega$ arithmetical in $\vec{R}$, there is an
infinite subset of some $A_j$ that computes no set cohesive for $\vec{R}$. This
complements a number of previous results in computability theory on the
computational feebleness of infinite sets of numbers with prescribed
combinatorial properties. The proof is a forcing argument using an adaptation
of the method of Seetapun showing that every finite coloring of pairs of
integers has an infinite homogeneous set not computing a given non-computable

In the weakly-screened regime violations can be especially prominent since the
fifth forces are at near full strength. Since they can also be calculated
perturbatively, we derive analytic solutions for illustrative cases: the motion
of massive objects in compensated shells and voids and infall toward halos that
are spherically symmetric. Using numerical techniques we show that these
solutions are valid until the characteristic scale becomes comparable to the
Vainshtein radius. We find a relative acceleration of more massive objects
toward the center of a void and a reduction of the infall acceleration that
increases with the mass ratio of the halos which can in principle be used to
test the Vainshtein screening mechanism.

topological states, such as topological insulators, attracted much attention.
In presence of interactions, group cohomology provides a classification of
these [X. Chen et al., arXiv:1106.4772v5 (2011)]. These phases have
short-ranged entanglement, and no topological order in the bulk. However, when
long-range entangled topological order is present, it is much less understood
how to classify quantum phases of matter in presence of global symmetries. Here
we present a classification of bosonic gapped quantum phases with or without
long-range entanglement, in the presence or absence of on-site global
symmetries. In 2+1 dimensions, the quantum phases in the presence of a global
symmetry group SG, and with topological order described by a finite gauge group
GG, are classified by the cohomology group H^3(SGxGG,U(1)). Generally in d+1
dimensions, such quantum phases are classified by H^{d+1}(SGxGG,U(1)). Although
we only partially understand to what extent our classification is complete, we
present an exactly solvable local bosonic model, in which the topological order
is emergent, for each given class in our classification. When the global
symmetry is absent, the topological order in our models is described by the
general Dijkgraaf-Witten discrete gauge theories. When the topological order is
absent, our models become the exactly solvable models for symmetry protected
topological phases [X. Chen et al., arXiv:1106.4772v5 (2011)]. When both the
global symmetry and the topological order are present, our models describe
symmetry enriched topological phases. Our classification includes, but goes
beyond the previously discussed projective symmetry group classification.
Measurable signatures of these symmetry enriched topological phases, and
generalizations of our classification are discussed.

effective single black hole system described by a Kerr metric, thereby
including certain relativistic effects such as zoom-whirl-type behavior. The
resultant geodesics source quadrupolar radiation and, in turn, are evolved
under its dissipative effects. At the light ring, we attach a merger model that
was previously developed for quasicircular mergers but also performs well for
eccentric mergers with little modification. We apply this model to determine
the detectability of these sources for initial, Enhanced, and Advanced LIGO
across the parameter space of nonspinning close capture compact binaries. We
conclude that, should these systems exist in nature, the vast majority will be
missed by conventional burst searches or by quasicircular waveform templates in
the advanced detector era. Other methods, such as eccentric templates or, more
practically, a stacked excess power search, must be developed to avoid losing
these sources. These systems would also have been missed frequently in the
initial LIGO data analysis. Thus, previous null coincidence results with
detected gamma-ray bursts cannot exclude the possibility of coincident
gravitational wave signals from eccentric binaries.

accessible. For mean field models represented by large random matrices with
independent entries, the celebrated Wigner-Dyson-Gaudin-Mehta (WDGM) conjecture
asserts that the local eigenvalue statistics are universal. For invariant
matrix models, the eigenvalue distributions are given by a log-gas with
potential $V$ and inverse temperature $\beta = 1, 2, 4$. corresponding to the
orthogonal, unitary and symplectic ensembles. For $\beta \not \in \{1, 2, 4\}$,
there is no natural random matrix ensemble behind this model, but the analogue
of the WDGM conjecture asserts that the local statistics are independent of
$V$.
  In these lecture notes we review the recent solution to these conjectures for
both invariant and non-invariant ensembles. We will discuss two different
notions of universality in the sense of (i) local correlation functions and
(ii) gap distributions.
  We will demonstrate that the local ergodicity of the Dyson Brownian motion is
the intrinsic mechanism behind the universality. In particular, we review the
solution of Dyson's conjecture on the local relaxation time of the Dyson
Brownian motion. Additionally, the gap distribution requires a De
Giorgi-Nash-Moser type H\""older regularity analysis for a discrete parabolic
equation with random coefficients.
  Related questions such as the local version of Wigner's semicircle law and
delocalization of eigenvectors will also be discussed. We will also explain how
these results can be extended beyond the mean field models, especially to
random band matrices.

expansion rate. Moreover, non-linear effects can systematically shift the peak
position, giving us the opportunity to exploit this clustering feature also as
a dynamical probe. We investigate the possibility of detecting interactions in
the dark sector through an accurate determination of the baryonic acoustic
scale. Making use of the public halo catalogues extracted from the CoDECS
simulations -- the largest suite of N-body simulations of interacting dark
energy models to date -- we determine the position of the baryonic scale
fitting a band-filtered correlation function, specifically designed to amplify
the signal at the sound horizon. We analyze the shifts due to non-linear
dynamics, redshift-space distortions and Gaussian redshift errors, in the range
0 < z < 2. Since the coupling between dark energy and dark matter affects in a
particular way the clustering properties of haloes and, specifically, the
amplitude and location of the baryonic acoustic oscillations, the cosmic
evolution of the baryonic peak position might provide a direct way to
discriminate interacting dark energy models from the standard \Lambda CDM
framework. To maximize the efficiency of the baryonic peak as a dynamic probe,
the correlation function has to be measured in redshift-space, where the
baryonic acoustic shift due to non-linearities is amplified. The typical
redshift errors of spectroscopic galaxy surveys do not significantly impact
these results.

disc, the turbulence being modelled by effective diffusion coefficients
(viscosity and resistivity). Both turbulent diffusion and advection by the
accretion flow contribute to flux transport, and they are likely to act in
opposition. We study the consequences of the vertical variation of the
diffusion coefficients, due to a varying strength of the turbulence. For this
purpose, we consider three different vertical profiles of these coefficients.
The first one is aimed at mimicking the turbulent stress profile observed in
numerical simulations of MHD turbulence in stratified discs. This enables us to
confirm the robustness of the main result of Paper I obtained for uniform
diffusion coefficients that, for weak magnetic fields, the contribution of the
accretion flow to the transport velocity of magnetic flux is much larger than
the transport velocity of mass. We then consider the presence of a dead zone
around the equatorial plane, where the physical resistivity is high while the
turbulent viscosity is low. We find that it amplifies the previous effect: weak
magnetic fields can be advected orders of magnitude faster than mass, for dead
zones with a large vertical extension. The ratio of advection to diffusion,
determining the maximum inclination of the field at the surface of the disc, is
however not much affected. Finally, we study the effect of a non-turbulent
layer at the surface of the disc, which has been suggested as a way to reduce
the diffusion of the magnetic flux. We find that the reduction of the diffusion
requires the conducting layer to extend below the height at which the magnetic
pressure equals the thermal pressure. As a consequence, if the absence of
turbulence is caused by the large-scale magnetic field, the highly conducting
layer is inefficient at reducing the diffusion.

consistent model of scaling relations between galaxy cluster masses and their
observable properties. This model can be used to constrain simultaneously the
form, scatter (including its covariance) and evolution of the scaling
relations, as well as the masses of the individual clusters. In this framework,
scaling relations between observables (such as that between X-ray luminosity
and temperature) are modelled explicitly in terms of the fundamental
mass-observable scaling relations, and so are fully constrained without being
fit directly. We apply the PICACS model to two observational datasets, and show
that it performs as well as traditional regression methods for simply measuring
individual scaling relation parameters, but reveals additional information on
the processes that shape the relations while providing self-consistent mass
constraints. Our analysis suggests that the observed combination of slopes of
the scaling relations can be described by a deficit of gas in low-mass clusters
that is compensated for by elevated gas temperatures, such that the total
thermal energy of the gas in a cluster of given mass remains close to
self-similar expectations. This is interpreted as the result of AGN feedback
removing low entropy gas from low mass systems, while heating the remaining
gas. We deconstruct the luminosity-temperature (LT) relation and show that its
steepening compared to self-similar expectations can be explained solely by
this combination of gas depletion and heating in low mass systems, without any
additional contribution from a mass dependence of the gas structure. Finally,
we demonstrate that a self-consistent analysis of the scaling relations leads
to an expectation of self-similar evolution of the LT relation that is
significantly weaker than is commonly assumed.

unbiased measurement of the average UV power-law index, beta, for faint
galaxies at z ~ 7, the first meaningful measurements of beta at z ~ 8, and
tentative estimates for a new sample of galaxies at z ~ 9. Utilising galaxy
selection in the new F140W imaging to minimize colour bias, and applying both
colour and power-law estimators of beta, we find beta = -2.1 (+/-0.2) at z ~ 7
for galaxies with M_UV ~ -18. This means that the faintest galaxies uncovered
at this epoch have, on average, UV colours no more extreme than those displayed
by the bluest star-forming galaxies at low redshift. At z ~ 8 we find a similar
value, beta = -1.9 (+/-0.3). At z ~ 9, we find beta = -1.8 (+/-0.6),
essentially unchanged from z ~ 6 - 7 (albeit highly uncertain). Finally, we
show that there is as yet no evidence for a significant intrinsic scatter in
beta within our new, robust z ~ 7 galaxy sample. Our results are most easily
explained by a population of steadily star-forming galaxies with either ~ solar
metallicity and zero dust, or moderately sub-solar (~ 10-20%) metallicity with
modest dust obscuration (A_V ~ 0.1-0.2). This latter interpretation is
consistent with the predictions of a state-of-the-art galaxy-formation
simulation, which also suggests that a significant population of very-low
metallicity, dust-free galaxies with beta ~ -2.5 may not emerge until M_UV >
-16, a regime likely to remain inaccessible until the James Webb Space
Telescope.

rates earlier, so it may be younger. The presence of a rotationally--supported

shifts that could be attributed to the motion of the donor star/hot spot around
the center of mass of the binary. We note a weak periodic signal in the
red-wing/blue-wing flux ratio of the emission feature at ~ 4650 {\AA}. The
signal occurs at P = 30.23 +/- 0.03 min in the X-Shooter and at P = 30.468 +/-
0.006 min in the GMOS spectra when the source was in the low/hard state. Due to
aliasing effects the period in the GMOS and X-Shooter data could well be the
same. We deem it likely that the orbital period is thus close to 30 min,
however, as several photometric periods have been reported for this source in
the literature already, further confirmation of the 30 min period is warranted.
We compare the surface area of the donor star and the disc of 4U 0614+091 with
the surface area of the donor star and the disc in typical hydrogen-rich
low-mass X-ray binaries and the class of AM Canum Venaticorum stars and argue
that the optical emission in 4U 0614+091 is likely dominated by the disc
emission. Additionally, we search for periodic signals in all the publicly

receives contributions of order <\delta_L^n> at each perturbative order n,

orders. Further, this approach naturally predicts both a scale-dependent bias ~
k^2 such as found for peaks of the density field, and the scale-dependent bias
induced by primordial non-Gaussianity in the initial conditions. The only

Second Catalog of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT). The Compton dominance, the ratio of the peak of the Compton to
the synchrotron peak luminosities, is essentially a redshift-independent
quantity, and thus crucial to answering this question. We find that a
correlation exists between Compton dominance and the peak frequency of the
synchrotron component for all blazars in the sample, including ones with
unknown redshift. We then construct a simple model to explain the blazar
properties in our sample, where the difference between sources is due to only
the magnetic field of the blazar jet emitting region, the external radiation
field energy density, and the jet angle to the line of sight, with the magnetic
field strength and external energy density being correlated. This model can
reproduce the trends of the blazars in the sample, and predicts blazars may be
discovered in the future with high synchrotron peak frequencies and
luminosities. At the same time the simple model reproduces the lack of

efficient placement of virtual machines to physical host machines in a network
cloud, so that the total number of occupied hosts is minimized. Customers of
different types arrive to a system with an infinite number of servers. A server
packing configuration is the vector $k = (k_i)$, where $k_i$ is the number of
type-$i$ customers that the server ""contains"". Packing constraints are
described by a fixed finite set of allowed configurations. Upon arrival, each
customer is placed into a server immediately, subject to the packing
constraints; the server can be idle or already serving other customers. After
service completion, each customer leaves its server and the system.
  It was shown recently that a simple real-time algorithm, called Greedy, is
asymptotically optimal in the sense of minimizing $\sum_k X_k^{1+\alpha}$ in
the stationary regime, as the customer arrival rates grow to infinity. (Here
\alpha >0, and $X_k$ denotes the number of servers with configuration $k$.) In
particular, when parameter \alpha is small, Greedy approximately solves the
problem of minimizing $\sum_k X_k$, the number of occupied hosts. In this paper
we introduce the algorithm called Greedy with sublinear Safety Stocks (GSS),
and show that it asymptotically solves the exact problem of minimizing $\sum_k
X_k$. An important feature of the algorithm is that sublinear safety stocks of
$X_k$ are created automatically - when and where necessary - without having to
determine a priori where they are required. Moreover, we also provide a tight
characterization of the rate of convergence to optimality under GSS. The GSS
algorithm is as simple as Greedy, and uses no more system state information

formula of noncommutative geometry provides a natural metric on the fractal. To
motivate the construction, we address Kigami's measurable Riemannian geometry,
which is a metric realization of the Sierpinski gasket as a self-affine space
with continuously differentiable geodesics. As a fractal analog of Connes'
theorem for a compact Riemmanian manifold, it is proved that the natural metric
coincides with Kigami's geodesic metric. This present work extends to the
harmonic gasket and other fractals built on curves a significant part of the
earlier results of E. Christensen, C. Ivan, and the first author obtained, in
particular, for the Euclidean Sierpinski gasket. (As is now well known, the
harmonic gasket, unlike the Euclidean gasket, is ideally suited to analysis on
fractals. It can be viewed as the Euclidean gasket in harmonic coordinates.)
Our current, broader framework allows for a variety of potential applications
to geometric analysis on fractal manifolds.

increased suddenly with the intensities of electrons reaching levels ~30-50%
higher than observed just one day earlier. This increase for GCR occurred over

the near-optimal approximation factor of (1 - 1/e - epsilon), for any epsilon >

terminated after O(beta(m+n)k log(n)) steps for some beta < 1 (which can depend

that PL handles theory and discrete Morse theory are equivalent, in the sense
that every discrete Morse vector on some PL triangulation is also a PL handle
vector, and conversely, every PL handle vector is also a discrete Morse vector
on some PL triangulation. It follows that in dimension up to 7, every discrete
Morse vector on some PL triangulation is also a smooth Morse vector; the vice

  Some further consequences of our work are:
  (1) For $d \ne 4$, every simply connected smooth d-manifold admits locally
constructible triangulations. In contrast, the Mazur 4-manifold has no locally
constructible triangulation. (This solves a question by Zivaljevic and
completes work by the author and Ziegler.)
  (2) The Heegaard genus of 3-manifolds can be characterized as the smallest
integer g for which some triangulation of the manifold has discrete Morse
vector (1,g,g,1). (This allows for heuristics to bound the Heegaard genus of
any 3-manifold.)
  (3) Some non-PL 5-spheres admit discrete Morse functions with only 2 critical
faces. (This result, joint with Adiprasito, completes the Sphere Theorem by
Forman.)

in the area of recurrent neural networks, several new developments will be
reviewed here that have allowed substantial progress both in understanding and
in technical solutions towards more efficient training of recurrent networks.
These advances have been motivated by and related to the optimization issues
surrounding deep learning. Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful
in what they can in principle represent in terms of modelling sequences,their
training is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of
long-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping
gradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced
momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and
encouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment.
The experiments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined
effects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test
error.

characterize the transition between a Mott-like phase of localized polaritons

diagram is non-trivial and well defined in the thermodynamic limit only if the
hopping coefficient scales like the inverse of the maximal eigenvalue of the
adjacency matrix of the network. Furthermore we provide numerical evidences
that, for some complex network topologies, this scaling implies an
asymptotically vanishing hopping coefficient in the limit of large network
sizes. The latter result suggests the interesting possibility of observing
quantum phase transitions of light on complex quantum networks even with very
small couplings between the optical cavities.

hyperviscous dissipation mechanism for small scales and the Ekman friction type
of linear damping mechanism for the large scales are included in the model. We
examine the effects of various dissipation and forcing parameters on the
turbulence statistics in both wave space and physical space. Our analysis
includes the effects of the effective forcing scale, the bandwidth of the
forcing, the memory correlation coefficient, and the forcing amplitude, along
with the large scale friction and small scale dissipation coefficients. Scaling
exponents of structure functions and energy spectra are calculated, and the
role of the parameters associated with the Markovian forcing is discussed. We
found that the scaling exponents are approximately invariant and show a
universal behavior for the various forms of forcing schemes used. We found,
however, that the final states strongly depend on the large scale friction
mechanism considered. When the large scale friction mechanism is included in
the model with a high friction coefficient, we demonstrate that the behavior is
no longer universal. Our analysis also shows that the second-order vorticity
structure function has an asymptotic scaling exponent for larger dissipation.
Additionally, we confirmed that vorticity behaves as a passive scalar when the
dissipation mechanism becomes less effective. Finally, although turbulence is

To this end, the performance of various high-order accurate numerical schemes

difference, explicit central difference, Arakawa, and
dispersion-relation-preserving schemes are analyzed and compared with the
Fourier-Galerkin pseudospectral scheme. In addition, several explicit
Runge-Kutta schemes for time integration are investigated. We demonstrate that
the centered schemes suffer from spurious Nyquist signals that are generated
almost instantaneously and propagate into much of the field when the numerical
resolution is insufficient. We further show that the order of the scheme
becomes increasingly important for increasing cell Reynolds number.
Surprisingly, the sixth-order schemes are found to be in perfect agreement with
the pseudospectral method. Considerable reduction in computational time
compared to the pseudospectral method is also reported in favor of the finite

better accuracy than the others for fully resolved computations. The

incompressible flow computations, which is applicable to methods involving
Poisson equations as incompressibility constraints. The CGP methodology is a
modular approach that facilitates data transfer with simple interpolations and
uses black-box solvers for the Poisson and advection-diffusion equations in the
flow solver. After solving the Poisson equation on a coarsened grid, an
interpolation scheme is used to obtain the fine data for subsequent time
stepping on the full grid. A particular version of the method is applied here
to the vorticity-stream function, primitive variable, and vorticity-velocity
formulations of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. We compute several
benchmark flow problems on two-dimensional Cartesian and non-Cartesian grids,
as well as a three-dimensional flow problem. The method is found to accelerate
these computations while retaining a level of accuracy close to that of the
fine resolution field, which is significantly better than the accuracy obtained
for a similar computation performed solely using a coarse grid. A linear
acceleration rate is obtained for all the cases we consider due to the
linear-cost elliptic Poisson solver used, with reduction factors in
computational time between 2 and 42. The computational savings are larger when
a suboptimal Poisson solver is used. We also find that the computational
savings increase with increasing distortion ratio on non-Cartesian grids,
making the CGP method a useful tool for accelerating generalized curvilinear
incompressible flow solvers.

surface gravity are mandatory to derive reliable chemical abundances and
fundamental parameters like distances, masses, radii, luminosities of OB stars.
Aims. Atmospheric parameters recently determined at high precision with several
independent spectroscopic indicators in NLTE are employed to calibrate
photometric relationships. Methods. Temperatures and gravities of 30
calibrators are compared to reddening-independent quantities of the Johnson and
Stroemgren photometric systems. We also examine the spectral and luminosity
classification of the star sample and compute bolometric corrections. Results.
Calibrations of temperatures and gravities are proposed for various photometric
indices and spectral types. Effective temperatures can be determined at a
precision of ~400 K for luminosity classes III/IV and ~800 K for luminosity
class V. Surface gravities can reach internal uncertainties as low as ~0.08 dex
when using our calibration to the Johnson Q-parameter. Similar precision is
achieved for gravities derived from the beta-index and the precision is lower
for both atmospheric parameters when using the Stroemgren indices c1 and [u-b].
Our uncertainties are smaller than typical differences among other methods in
the literature, reaching values up to ~2000 K for temperature and ~0.25 dex for
gravity, and in extreme cases, ~6000 K and ~0.4 dex, respectively. A parameter
calibration for sub-spectral types is also proposed. We present a new
bolometric correction relation to temperature based on our empirical data.
Conclusions. The photometric calibrations presented here are useful tools to
estimate effective temperatures and surface gravities of non-supergiant OB
stars in a fast manner. We recommend to use these calibrations as a first step,
with subsequent refinements based on spectroscopy (abridged).

waves with all directions, polarizations, phases and intensities. A smooth
description of polarization, valid over the entire sphere S^2 of directions, is
given through the construction of an orthogonal basis pair of complex
polarization vectors for each direction; any light beam is then uniquely and
smoothly specified by giving its direction and two complex amplitudes. This
implies that the space of all light beams is the six dimensional manifold S^2 X
C^2, the Cartesian product of a sphere and a two dimensional complex vector
space. A Hopf map (i.e mapping the two complex amplitudes to the Stokes
parameters) then leads to the four dimensional manifold S^2 X S^2 which
describes beams with all directions and polarization states. This product of
two spheres can be viewed as an ordered pair of two points on a single sphere,
in contrast to earlier work in which the same system was represented using
Majorana's mapping of the states of a spin one quantum system to an unordered
pair of points on a sphere. This is a different manifold, CP^2, two dimensional
complex projective space, which does not faithfully represent the full space of
all directions and polarizations. Following the now-standard framework, we
exhibit the fibre bundle whose total space is the set of all light beams of
non-zero intensity, and base space S^2 X S^2. We give the U(1) connection which
determines the geometric phase as the line integral of a one-form along a
closed curve in the total space. Bases are classified as globally smooth,
global but singular, and local, with the last type of basis being defined only
when the curve traversed by the system is given. Existing as well as new
formulae for the geometric phase are presented in this overall framework.

has been to design an xc functional with broad accuracy across as wide an
expanse of chemistry and physics as possible, leading-as a long-range goal-to a
functional with good accuracy for all problems, i.e., a universal functional.
To guide our path toward that goal and to measure our progress, we have
developed-building on earlier work in our group-a set of databases of reference
data for a variety of energetic and structural properties in chemistry and
physics. These databases include energies of molecular processes such as
atomization, complexation, proton addition, and ionization; they also include
molecular geometries and solid-state lattice constants, chemical reaction
barrier heights, and cohesive energies and band gaps of solids. For the present
paper we gather many of these databases into four comprehensive databases, two
with 384 energetic data for chemistry and solid-state physics and another two
with 68 structural data for chemistry and solid-state physics, and we test 2
wave function methods and 77 density functionals (12 Minnesota meta functionals
and 65 others) in a consistent way across this same broad set of data. We
especially highlight the Minnesota density functionals, but the results have
broader implications in that one may see the successes and failures of many
kinds of density functionals when they are all applied to the same data.
Therefore the results provide a status report on the quest for a universal

that social filtering brings relevant content to the interested users. Our
motivation in this paper is to measure to what extent self-organization of the
social network results in efficient social filtering. To this end we introduce
flow games, a simple abstraction that models network formation under selfish
user dynamics, featuring user-specific interests and budget of attention. In
the context of homogeneous user interests, we show that selfish dynamics
converge to a stable network structure (namely a pure Nash equilibrium) with
close-to-optimal information dissemination. We show in contrast, for the more
realistic case of heterogeneous interests, that convergence, if it occurs, may
lead to information dissemination that can be arbitrarily inefficient, as
captured by an unbounded ""price of anarchy"". Nevertheless the situation differs
when users' interests exhibit a particular structure, captured by a metric
space with low doubling dimension. In that case, natural autonomous dynamics
converge to a stable configuration. Moreover, users obtain all the information
of interest to them in the corresponding dissemination, provided their budget
of attention is logarithmic in the size of their interest set.

rare. This is due to the small magnitude of quadratic MO signals and the fact
that the signals are even in magnetization (i.e., they do not change a sign
when the magnetization orientation is flipped), which makes it difficult to
separate second-order MO signals from various experimental artifacts. In 2005 a

development of experimental techniques for the measurement of second-order MO

harmonic dependence of MLD on a mutual orientation of magnetization and light

practical bottleneck. Instead, we seek methodology for estimating performance
of the classifiers which is more scalable than expert labeling yet preserves
high correlation with evaluation based on expert labels. We consider both: 1)
using only labels automatically generated by the classifiers (blind
evaluation); and 2) using labels obtained via crowdsourcing. While
crowdsourcing methods are lauded for scalability, using such data for
evaluation raises serious concerns given the prevalence of label noise. In
regard to blind evaluation, two broad strategies are investigated: combine &
score and score & combine methods infer a single pseudo-gold label set by
aggregating classifier labels; classifiers are then evaluated based on this
single pseudo-gold label set. On the other hand, score & combine methods: 1)
sample multiple label sets from classifier outputs, 2) evaluate classifiers on
each label set, and 3) average classifier performance across label sets. When
additional crowd labels are also collected, we investigate two alternative
avenues for exploiting them: 1) direct evaluation of classifiers; or 2)
supervision of combine & score methods. To assess generality of our techniques,
classifier performance is measured using four common classification metrics,
with statistical significance tests. Finally, we measure both score and rank
correlations between estimated classifier performance vs. actual performance

in stabilizing the folded ribosomal RNA by their high negative free energy of
association, where tertiary binders mainly help to stabilize protein-protein
interfaces. Secondary binders perform both the functions. Conformational
changes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomal proteins due to complexation
with 16S ribosomal RNA are linearly correlated with their RNA-interface area
and free energy of association. The proteins having long extensions buried
within ribosomal RNA have more flexible structures than those found on the
subunit surface. Thermus thermophilus ribosomal proteins undergo high
conformational changes compared to those of Escherichia coli, assuring
structural stability at high temperature environment. The general stabilization

of heavy petroleum fractions namely DAE, RAE, BQ-1, and asphaltenes derived
from BQ-1 were used together with anthracite coal and bitumen as model
compounds in matching the band pattern of the emission features of
proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe). All the model materials were examined in the
mid-infrared (2.5-16.7 um) and for the first time in the far-infrared (16.7-200
um), and the IR bands were compared with the UIE from PPNe. The best match of
the PPNe band pattern is offered by the BQ-1 heavy aromatic oil fraction and by
its asphaltenes fraction. Particularly interesting is the ability of BQ-1 to
match the band pattern of the aromatic-aliphatic C-H stretching bands of
certain PPNe, a result which is not achieved neither by the coal model nor by
the other petroleum fractions considered here. This study shows that a new
interesting molecular model of the emission features of PPNe are asphaltene
molecules which are composed by an aromatic core containing 3-4 condensed
aromatic rings surrounded by cycloaliphatic (naphtenic) and aliphatic alkyl
chains. It is instead shown the weakness of the model involving a mixture of
PAHs for modeling the aromatic IR emission bands. The laboratory spectra of

many features with bright Large Area Telescope bursts observed by \Fermi during
the first 3 years on-orbit: a light curve with short time variability across
the whole energy range during the prompt phase, delayed onset of the emission
above 100 MeV, extra power law component and temporally extended high-energy
emission. In addition, this the first GRB for which simultaneous GeV, X-ray,

analysis in different epochs that favor emission from the forward shock in a

part of the high-energy end of the afterglow emission. Both the single-zone

to an estimate of the bulk Lorentz factor of the jet $\Gamma\sim$ 500 - 550.

new method for measuring clustering of the galaxy population at high redshift

radiative transfer effects may modify the observed clustering of LAE galaxies
in a way that mimics gravitational effects, potentially reducing the precision
of cosmological constraints. For example, the effect of the linear
redshift-space distortion on the power spectrum of LAE galaxies is potentially
degenerate with Lyman-alpha radiative transfer effects owing to the dependence
of observed flux on intergalactic medium velocity gradients. In this paper, we
show that the three-point function (bispectrum) can distinguish between
gravitational and non-gravitational effects, and thus breaks these
degeneracies, making it possible to recover cosmological parameters from LAE
galaxy surveys. Constraints on the angular diameter distance and the Hubble
expansion rate can also be improved by combining power spectrum and bispectrum
measurements.

first one based on their X-ray/radio emission and the second one based on their
mid-infrared colors. The results of the first analysis confirm the correlation
between black hole and total stellar mass for 8 galaxies and includes one
galaxy classified as bulgeless. The results of our second analysis, consisting
of 15,991 galaxies, show that galaxies hosting a supermassive black hole follow
the same morphological distribution as the general population of galaxies in
the same redshift range. In particular, the fraction of bulgeless galaxies,
1,450 galaxies or 9 percent, is found to be the same as in the general
population. We also present the correlation between black hole and total
stellar mass for 6,247 of these galaxies. Importantly, whereas previous studies
were limited to primarily bulge-dominated systems, our study confirms this
relationship to all morphological types, in particular, to 530 bulgeless
galaxies. Our results indicate that the true correlation that exists for
supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is between the black hole mass
and the total stellar mass of the galaxy and hence, we conclude that the
previous assumption that the black hole mass is correlated with the bulge mass

missing regions on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. In
practical situation, surfaces obtained from range scanners often have holes
where the 3D models are incomplete. In order to analyze the 3D shapes
effectively, restoring the incomplete shape by filling in the surface holes is
necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel conformal approach to inpaint
surface holes on a Riemann surface based on its surface geometry. The basic
idea is to represent the Riemann surface using its conformal factor and mean
curvature. According to Riemann surface theory, a Riemann surface can be
uniquely determined by its conformal factor and mean curvature up to a rigid
motion. Given a Riemann surface $S$, its mean curvature $H$ and conformal
factor $\lambda$ can be computed easily through its conformal parameterization.
Conversely, given $\lambda$ and $H$, a Riemann surface can be uniquely
reconstructed by solving the Gauss-Codazzi equation on the conformal parameter
domain. Hence, the conformal factor and the mean curvature are two geometric
quantities fully describing the surface. With this $\lambda$-$H$ representation
of the surface, the problem of surface inpainting can be reduced to the problem
of image inpainting of $\lambda$ and $H$ on the conformal parameter domain.
Once $\lambda$ and $H$ are inpainted, a Riemann surface can be reconstructed
which effectively restores the 3D surface with missing holes. Since the
inpainting model is based on the geometric quantities $\lambda$ and $H$, the
restored surface follows the surface geometric pattern. We test the proposed
algorithm on synthetic data as well as real surface data. Experimental results
show that our proposed method is an effective surface inpainting algorithm to
fill in surface holes on an incomplete 3D models based their surface geometry.

suggested [A. Ghoshray, et al., Phys. Rev. B 79, 144512 (2009)]. The
temperature dependence of the $^{75}$As NMR shifts for the two peaks is
consistent with hyperfine coupling from magnetic Ce to As and with different
Curie-Weiss temperatures. The appearance of two Curie-Weiss temperatures where
one is near zero and the other is $\sim$-18 K suggests that the two peaks arise
from ordered and disordered regions where the disorder could be due to regions
with significant fluorine site disorder and/or clusters of oxygen vacancies.
Similar to some other studies on ReFeAsO$_{1-x}$F$_x$ (Re is a rare earth) we

high structural quality of the superlattice and the substrate, the specular
reflectivity signal extends with a high signal-to-background ratio beyond the
fourth order superlattice Bragg peak. This allows us to obtain more detailed
and reliable information about the magnetic depth profile than in previous PNR
studies on similar superlattices that were partially impeded by problems
related to the low temperature structural transitions of the SrTiO3 substrates.
In agreement with the previous reports, our PNR data reveal a strong magnetic
proximity effect showing that the depth profile of the magnetic potential
differs significantly from the one of the nuclear potential that is given by
the YBCO and LCMO layer thickness. We present fits of the PNR data using
different simple block-like models for which either a ferromagnetic moment is
induced on the YBCO side of the interfaces or the ferromagnetic order is
suppressed on the LCMO side. We show that a good agreement with the PNR data
and with the average magnetization as obtained from dc magnetization data can
only be obtained with the latter model where a so-called depleted layer with a
strongly suppressed ferromagnetic moment develops on the LCMO side of the
interfaces. The models with an induced ferromagnetic moment on the YBCO side
fail to reproduce the details of the higher order superlattice Bragg peaks and
yield a wrong magnitude of the average magnetization. We also show that the PNR

this source seems to be classified into two sub-states in terms of the X-ray
luminosities in 0.5-10 keV: the low luminosity PL state with 4-6*10^{39} erg/s
and the high luminosity one with 1.1-1.4*10^{40} erg/s. During the Suzaku
observations which were made in 2010 August and 2011 March, X-1 stayed in the
low luminosity PL state. The observed X-ray luminosity (4.9-5.6*10^{39} erg/s)
and the spectral shape (photon index = 1.67-1.83) slightly changed between the
two observations. Using the Suzaku PIN detector, we for the first time
confirmed a PL tail extending up to at least 20 keV with no signatures of a
high-energy turnover in both of the Suzaku observations. In contrast, a
turnover at about 6 keV was observed during the high luminosity PL state in
2004 and 2005 with XMM-Newton. Importantly, photon indices are similar between
the two PL states and so is the Compton y-parameters of y ~ 1, which indicates
a similar energy balance (between the corona and the accretion disk) holding in
the two PL states despite different electron temperatures. From spectral
similarities with recent studies about other ULXs and the Galactic black hole
binary GRS1915+105, IC342 X-1 is also likely to be in a state with a
supercritical accretion rate, although more sensitive higher energy
observations would be necessary to conclude.

  No connection is found between X-ray and emission line luminosities from

correlation emerges when using the HST spectroscopic data, which are extracted
on a much smaller aperture. This suggests that the HST data better isolate the
AGN component when one is present, while ground-based line measurements are
affected by diffuse emission from the host galaxies.
  The sample separates into two populations. The 11 objects belonging to the
first class have an equivalent width of the [OIII] emission line measured from
HST data EW([OIII])>~2 A and are associated with an X-ray nuclear source; in

nominally pure LaMnO3 single crystal with a moderate field which leads to a
resistive state transition below 300 K. The transition is between the
insulating state in LaMnO3 and a high resistance bad metallic state that has a
temperature independent resistivity. The transition occurs at a threshold field
(Eth) which shows a steep enhancement on cooling. While at lower temperatures
the transition is sharp and involves large change in resistance but it softens
on heating and eventually absent above 280K. When the Mn4+ content is increased
by Sr substitution up to x=0.1, the observed transition though observable in
certain temperature range, softens considerably. The observation has been
explained as bias driven percolation type transition between two coexisting
phases, where the majority phase is a charge and orbitally ordered polaronic
insulating phase and the minority phase is a bad metallic phase. The mobile
fraction f of the bad metallic phase deduced from the experimental data follows
an activated kinetics with the activation energy nearly equal to 200 meV and
the prefactor fo is a strong function of the field that leads to a rapid
enhancement of f on application of field leading to the resistive state
transition. We suggest likely scenarios for such co-existing phases in
nominally pure LaMnO3 that can lead to the bias driven percolation type
transition.

behaviour, obtained for the lattice version of the model. We work in the Landau
version of the 't Hooft R_\xi gauges in which case we can access potential
nonperturbative physics related to the existence of the Gribov copies. In the
fundamental case, we clearly show that in the perturbative regime of small
gauge coupling constant g and large Higgs vacuum expectation value v, there is
a Higgs phase with Yukawa gauge boson propagators without Gribov effects. For a
small value of the Higgs vev v and/or large g, we enter a region with Gribov
type propagators that have no physical particle interpretation: the gauge
bosons are as such confined. The transition between both behaviours is found to
be continuous. In the adjoint case, we find evidence of a more drastic
transition between the different behaviours for the propagator of the
off-diagonal gauge bosons, whereas the ""photon"", i.e. the diagonal component of
the gauge field, displays a propagator of the Gribov type. In the limit of
infinite Higgs condensate, we show that a massless photon is recovered. We
compare our findings with those of Fradkin & Shenker as well as with more

space-time evolution of the strongly interacting matter created in
ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions. For a proper comparison to experimental
data, fluid-dynamical calculations have to be performed on an event-by-event
basis. Therefore, fluid dynamics should be able to reproduce, not only the
event-averaged momentum anisotropies, $<v_{n}>$, but also their distributions.
In this paper, we investigate the event-by-event distributions of the
initial-state and momentum anisotropies $\epsilon_n$ and $v_n$, and their
correlations. We demonstrate that the event-by-event distributions of relative
$v_n$ fluctuations are almost equal to the event-by-event distributions of
corresponding $\epsilon_n$ fluctuations, allowing experimental determination of
the relative anisotropy fluctuations of the initial state. Furthermore, the
correlation $c(v_2,v_4)$ turns out to be sensitive to the viscosity of the
fluid providing an additional constraint to the properties of the strongly

spectroscopy of the night side of Venus was obtained with the Anglo-Australian

VEX/SPICAV (R ~ 1700) and contrary to prior results by B\'ezard et al. 2009 of
44 ppmv (+/-9 ppmv) using VEX/VIRTIS-M (R ~ 200) data analyses. Comparison
studies are made between water vapour abundances determined from the peak of

absorption features within the near infrared window. We find that water vapour
abundances determined over the peak of the 1.18 \mu m window results in plots
with less scatter than those of the individual water vapour features and that
analyses conducted over some individual water vapour features are more
sensitive to variation in water vapour than those over the peak of the 1.18 \mu

of the disk are found within the limits of our data with the exception of a
possible small decrease in water vapour from the equator to the north pole. We

a decreasing water vapour concentration towards the surface.

has opened up prospects for neutron star asteroseismology. However, with only
three giant flares ever recorded, and only two with data of sufficient quality
to search for QPOs, such analysis is seriously data limited. We set out a
procedure for doing QPO searches in the far more numerous, short, less
energetic magnetar bursts. The short, transient nature of these bursts requires
the implementation of sophisticated statistical techniques to make reliable
inferences. Using Bayesian statistics, we model the periodogram as a
combination of red noise at low frequencies and white noise at high
frequencies, which we show is a conservative approach to the problem. We use
empirical models to make inferences about the potential signature of periodic
and quasi-periodic oscillations at these frequencies. We compare our method
with previously used techniques and find that although it is on the whole more
conservative, it is also more reliable in ruling out false positives. We
illustrate our Bayesian method by applying it to a sample of 27 bursts from the
magnetar SGR J0501+4516 observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and we
find no evidence for the presence of QPOs in any of the bursts in the unbinned
spectra, but do find a candidate detection in the binned spectra of one burst.
However, whether this signal is due to a genuine quasi-periodic process, or can
be attributed to unmodeled effects in the noise is at this point a matter of
interpretation.

exact expressions for both the diffusive and non-diffusive gain. We then apply
this approach to polymer translocation under constant forcing through a pore

low frequency oscillation with deviations occurring at longer lengths and
higher frequencies. Unlike periodic forcing of a single particle at constant
mobility, constant forcing with time dependent mobility is amenable to exact
solution through manipulation of the Fokker-Planck equation.

to obtain information on the ejection mechanism and the spectral properties of
the object, to see if they are compatible with those of ""normal"" comets.
  Images in the g and r band and a low-resolution spectrum in the 0.35-0.9
micron region were obtained with the GTC telescope (La Palma, Spain). Images
were analyzed to produce a color map and derive a lower limit of the absolute
magnitude. A Monte Carlo (MC) scattering model was used to derive dust
properties such as mass loss rates and ejection velocities as a function of
time. The spectrum was compared to that of MBC 133P/Elst-Pizarro and used to
search for CN emission.
  The spectrum of 2006 VW139 is typical of a C-class asteroid, with a spectral
slope S=0.5+/-1.0%/1000A. It is similar to the spectrum of 133P and other MBCs.
No CN emission is detected. A CN production rate upper limit of 3.76e23 1/s is
derived. The MBC present a narrow almost linear tail that extends up to 40.000
km in the anti-solar direction and more than 80.000 km in the direction of the
object's orbital plane. The color of the tail is slightly redder than the Sun
(S=3 to 6%/1000A). The MC dust tail model derived the mass loss rates and
ejection velocity as a function of time, and the results show that the activity
onset occurs shortly after perihelion, and lasts about 100 days; the total
ejected mass is about 2e6 kg.
  The spectrum of VW139 suggests that it is not a ""normal"" comet. It is typical
of the other observed MBCs. Even if no CN emission is detected, the more likely
activation mechanism is water-ice sublimation. Like other well studied MBCs,
VW139 is likely a primitive C-class asteroid that has a water-ice subsurface

orbital-selective dynamical localisation arising from preformed excitonic

fluid dynamics requires developing numerical techniques for solving the
stochastic partial differential equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. These
Langevin equations possess a special fluctuation-dissipation structure that
needs to be preserved by spatio-temporal discretizations in order for the
computed solution to reproduce the correct long-time behavior. In particular,
numerical solutions should approximate the Gibbs-Boltzmann equilibrium
distribution, and ideally this will hold even for large time step sizes. We
describe finite-volume spatial discretizations for the fluctuating Burgers and
fluctuating incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that obey a discrete
fluctuation-dissipation balance principle just like the continuum equations. We
develop implicit-explicit predictor-corrector temporal integrators for the
resulting stochastic method-of-lines discretization. These stochastic
Runge-Kutta schemes treat diffusion implicitly and advection explicitly, are
weakly second-order accurate for additive noise for small time steps, and give
a good approximation to the equilibrium distribution even for very strong
fluctuations. Numerical results demonstrate that a midpoint predictor-corrector
scheme is very robust over a broad range of time step sizes.

  and Stepwise Approach",,,,,"cs.DB cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Latency is a key service factor for user satisfaction. Consistency is in a
trade-off relation with operation latency in the distributed and replicated
scenario. Existing NoSQL stores guarantee either strong or weak consistencies
but none provides the best consistency based on the response latency. In this
paper, we introduce dConssandra, a NoSQL store enabling users to specify
latency bounds for data access operations. dConssandra dynamically bounds data
access latency by trading off replica consistency. dConssandra is based on
Cassandra. In comparison to Cassandra's implementation, dConssandra has a
staged replication strategy enabling synchronous or asynchronous replication on
demand. The main idea to bound latency by trading off consistency is to
decompose the replication process into minute steps and bound latency by
executing only a subset of these steps. dConssandra also implements a different
in-memory storage architecture to support the above features. Experimental
results for dConssandra over an actual cluster demonstrate that (1) the actual
response latency is bounded by the given latency constraint; (2) greater write
latency bounds lead to a lower latency in reading the latest value; and, (3)
greater read latency bounds lead to the return of more recently written values.

parameter of a strongly coupled superconductor after a perturbation that drives
the system out of equilibrium. The gravity dual that we employ is the ${\rm

modes associated to the superconducting order parameter which are purely real
since the background has no horizon. We then study the full time evolution of
the order parameter after a quench. For sufficiently a weak and slow
perturbation we show that the order parameter undergoes simple undamped
oscillations in time with a frequency that agrees with the lowest normal model
computed previously. This is expected as the soliton background has no horizon
and therefore, at least in the probe and large $N$ limits considered, the
system will never return to equilibrium. For stronger and more abrupt
perturbations higher normal modes are excited and the pattern of oscillations
becomes increasingly intricate. We identify a range of parameters for which the
time evolution of the order parameter become quasi chaotic. The details of the
chaotic evolution depend on the type of perturbation used. Therefore it is
plausible to expect that it is possible to engineer a perturbation that leads
to the almost complete destruction of the oscillating pattern and consequently
to quasi equilibration induced by superposition of modes with different
frequencies.

down the translocation, and the translocation time increases with increasing

translocation through minor axis is faster, and vice versa. These complicated

velocity induced by a significant increase of the frictional force. In

during the late Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) and early post-AGB phases of low-
and intermediate-mass stars. Among all post-AGB objects, the most heavily
obscured ones might have escaped the selection criteria of previous studies
detecting extreme axysimmetric structures in young PNe. Since the most heavily
obscured post-AGB sources can be expected to descend from the most massive PN
progenitors, these should exhibit clear asymmetric morphologies. We have
obtained VISIR-VLT mid-IR images of four heavily obscured post-AGB objects
barely resolved in previous Spitzer IRAC observations to analyze their
morphology and physical conditions across the mid-IR. The VISIR-VLT images have
been deconvolved, flux calibrated, and used to construct RGB composite pictures
as well as color and optical depth maps that allow us to study the morphology
and physical properties of the extended emission of these sources. We have
detected extended emission from the four objects in our sample and resolved it
into several structural components that are greatly enhanced in the temperature
and optical depth maps. They reveal the presence of asymmetry in three young
PNe (IRAS 15534-5422, IRAS 17009-4154, and IRAS 18454+0001), where the
asymmetries can be associated with dusty torii and slightly bipolar outflows.
The fourth source (IRAS 18229-1127), a possible post-AGB star, is better
described as a rhomboidal detached shell. The heavily obscured sources in our
sample do not show extreme axisymmetric morphologies. This is at odds with the
expectation of highly asymmetrical morphologies in post-AGB sources descending
from massive PN progenitors. The sources presented in this paper may be

heavy neutrino is significantly different from that of the ordinary neutrinos.
While the ordinary neutrinos are emitted to various directions in the

emitted to the forward directions and frequently hit the detector.The
sensitivity for the mixing parameters is studied by evaluating the number of

theory. They describe situations where two players interact repeatedly and have
the possibility to use conditional strategies that depend on the outcome of
previous interactions. In the context of evolution of cooperation, repeated
games represent the mechanism of reciprocation. Recently a new class of
strategies has been proposed, so called 'zero determinant strategies'. These
strategies enforce a fixed linear relationship between one's own payoff and
that of the other player. A subset of those strategies are 'extortioners' which
ensure that any increase in the own payoff exceeds that of the other player by
a fixed percentage. Here we analyze the evolutionary performance of this new
class of strategies. We show that in reasonably large populations they can act
as catalysts for the evolution of cooperation, similar to tit-for-tat, but they
are not the stable outcome of natural selection. In very small populations,
however, relative payoff differences between two players in a contest matter,
and extortioners hold their ground. Extortion strategies do particularly well
in co-evolutionary arms races between two distinct populations: significantly,
they benefit the population which evolves at the slower rate - an instance of
the so-called Red King effect. This may affect the evolution of interactions
between host species and their endosymbionts.

Recently it has been shown that under mild conditions Voronoi diagrams have a
certain continuity property: small perturbations of the sites yield small
perturbations in the shapes of the corresponding Voronoi cells. However, this
result is based on the assumption that the ambient normed space is uniformly
convex. Unfortunately, simple counterexamples show that if uniform convexity is
removed, then instability can occur. Since Voronoi diagrams in normed spaces
which are not uniformly convex do appear in theory and practice, e.g., in the
plane with the Manhattan (ell_1) distance, it is natural to ask whether the
stability property can be generalized to them, perhaps under additional
assumptions. This paper shows that this is indeed the case assuming the unit
sphere of the space has a certain (non-exotic) structure and the sites satisfy
a certain ""general position"" condition related to it. The condition on the unit
sphere is that it can be decomposed into at most one ""rotund part"" and at most
finitely many non-degenerate convex parts. Along the way certain topological
properties of Votonoi cells (e.g., that the induced bisectors are not ""fat"")
