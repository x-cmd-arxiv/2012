  Performance in Multi-Channel Wireless Networks with Low Complexity: A
  Practical Greedy Scheduling Policy","Accepted for publication by the IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking,
  February 2014. A preliminary version of this work was presented at IEEE
  INFOCOM 2013, Turin, Italy, April 2013",,,,"cs.NI cs.IT cs.PF math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we focus on the scheduling problem in multi-channel wireless
networks, e.g., the downlink of a single cell in fourth generation (4G)
OFDM-based cellular networks. Our goal is to design practical scheduling
policies that can achieve provably good performance in terms of both throughput
and delay, at a low complexity. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \log n)$-complexity
hybrid scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee both
rate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic
regime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting),
their practical complexity is typically high. To address this issue, we develop
a simple greedy policy called Delay-based Server-Side-Greedy (D-SSG) with a
\lower complexity $2n^2+2n$, and rigorously prove that D-SSG not only achieves
throughput optimality, but also guarantees near-optimal asymptotic delay
performance. Specifically, we show that the rate-function attained by D-SSG for
any delay-violation threshold $b$, is no smaller than the maximum achievable
rate-function by any scheduling policy for threshold $b-1$. Thus, we are able
to achieve a reduction in complexity (from $O(n^{2.5} \log n)$ of the hybrid
policies to $2n^2 + 2n$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance. More
importantly, in practice, D-SSG generally has a substantially lower complexity
than the hybrid policies that typically have a large constant factor hidden in
the $O(\cdot)$ notation. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations to validate
our theoretical results in various scenarios. The simulation results show that
D-SSG not only guarantees a near-optimal rate-function, but also empirically is
virtually indistinguishable from delay-optimal policies.

particle filters, which is designed with GPUs (graphics processing units) or
similar parallel computing devices in mind. With our new algorithm, a full
cycle of particle filtering (computing the value of the likelihood for each
particle, constructing the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for
resampling, resampling the particles with the CDF, and propagating new
particles for the next cycle) can be executed in a massively and completely
parallel manner. One of the advantages of our algorithm is that every single
numerical computation or memory access related to the particle filtering is
executed solely inside the GPU in parallel, and no data transfer between the
GPU's device memory and the CPU's host memory occurs unless for further
processing, so that it can circumvent the limited memory bandwidth between the
GPU and the CPU. To demonstrate the advantage of our parallel algorithm, we
conducted a Monte Carlo experiment in which we apply the parallel algorithm as
well as conventional sequential algorithms for estimation of a simple state
space model via particle learning, and compare them in terms of execution time.
The results show that the parallel algorithm is far superior to the sequential
algorithm.

  ""Concurrence topology"" is an apparently new nonparametric method for
describing high-order dependence among up to dozens of dichotomous variables
(e.g., seventh-order dependence in 32 variables). This method generally
produces summaries of $p^{th}$-order dependence of manageable size no matter
how big $p$ is. (But computing time can be lengthy.) For time series, this
method can be applied in both the time and Fourier domains.
  Write each observation as a vector of 0's and 1's. A ""concurrence"" is a group
of variables all ""1"" in the same observation. The collection of concurrences
can be represented as a sequence of shapes (""filtration"").
  Holes in the filtration indicate weak or negative association among the
variables. The pattern of the holes in the filtration can be analyzed using
computational topology.
  This method is demonstrated on dichotomized fMRI data. The dataset includes
subjects diagnosed with ADHD and healthy controls. In an exploratory analysis
numerous group differences in the topology of the filtrations are found.

familiar and popular mathematical puzzle. Sudoku puzzles provide a very rare
example of a class of frustrated systems with a unique groundstate without
symmetry. Here, the puzzle is recast as thermodynamic system where the number
of violated rules defines the energy. We use Monte Carlo simulation to show
that the ""Sudoku Hamiltonian"" exhibits two transitions as a function of
temperature, a paramagnetic and a glass transition. Of these, the intermediate
condensed phase is the only one which visits the ground state (i.e. it solves
the puzzle, though this is not the purpose of the study). Both transitions are
associated with an entropy change, paramagnetism measured from the dynamics of
the Monte Carlo run, showing a peak in specific heat, while the residual glass
entropy is determined by finding multiple instances of the glass by repeated
annealing. There are relatively few such simple models for frustrated or glassy
systems which exhibit both ordering and glass transitions, sudoku puzzles are
unique for the ease with which they can be obtained with the proof of the
existence of a unique ground state via the satisfiability of all constraints.
Simulations suggest that in the glass phase there is an increase in information
entropy with lowering temperature. In fact, we have shown that sudoku have the
type of rugged energy landscape with multiple minima which typifies glasses in
many physical systems, and this puzzling result is a manifestation of the
paradox of the residual glass entropy. These readily-available puzzles can now
be used as solvable model Hamiltonian systems for studying the glass
transition.

threshold of trigger hadron of 5 GeV/$c$ with the new calorimeter-based
triggers with energy thresholds of up to 10 GeV and above. The distributions of

modifications compared to d+Au data at the same energy. An imbalance in the
total transverse momentum between hadrons attributed to the near-side and

measurement with respect to d+Au reference is found to increase with the
asymmetry of the trigger pair, consistent with expectation from medium-induced
energy loss effects. In addition, this relative total transverse momentum
imbalance is found to decrease for softer associated hadrons. Such evolution
indicates the energy missing at higher associated momenta is converted into

the hints of a Higgs boson at 125 GeV imply some degree of fine-tuning from
radiative corrections to the lightest Higgs mass. Moreover, the rate into
photons seems to be enhanced with respect to the SM, while the ZZ channel is
reduced (albeit the SM is still compatible at the 2-sigma level). In this talk
I will review how the previous issues can be addressed. If the stop is about a
couple-hundred GeV, the SUSY still remains as a natural solution to the
hierarchy problem. I will also show how the MSSM can accommodate a 125 GeV
Higgs and also how extensions of the MSSM can alleviate the fine-tuning on the

graph that generalize the shortest path distance and the commute time or
resistance distance. The need for developing such distances has risen from the
observation that the above-mentioned common distances in many situations fail
to take into account the global structure of the graph. In this article, we
develop the theory of one family of graph node distances, known as the
randomized shortest path dissimilarity, which has its foundation in statistical
physics. We show that the randomized shortest path dissimilarity can be easily
computed in closed form for all pairs of nodes of a graph. Moreover, we come up
with a new definition of a distance measure that we call the free energy
distance. The free energy distance can be seen as an upgrade of the randomized
shortest path dissimilarity as it defines a metric, in addition to which it
satisfies the graph-geodetic property. The derivation and computation of the
free energy distance are also straightforward. We then make a comparison
between a set of generalized distances that interpolate between the shortest
path distance and the commute time, or resistance distance. This comparison
focuses on the applicability of the distances in graph node clustering and
classification. The comparison, in general, shows that the parametrized
distances perform well in the tasks. In particular, we see that the results
obtained with the free energy distance are among the best in all the
experiments.

have an important role in the generation of protein aggregates, and a mechanism
for this fibril formation considers that these intermediates also correspond to
metastable states with respect to the fibrillar ones. Here, using a
coarse-grained (CG) off-lattice model, we carry out a comparative analysis of
the thermodynamic aspects characterizing the folding transition with respect to
the propensity for aggregation of four different systems: two isoforms of the
amyloid $\beta$-protein, the Src SH3 domain, and the human prion proteins
(hPrP). Microcanonical analysis of the data obtained from replica exchange
method (REM) is conducted to evaluate the free-energy barrier and latent heat
in these models. The simulations of the amyloid $\beta$ isoforms and Src SH3
domain indicated that the folding process described by this CG model is related
to a negative specific heat, a phenomenon that can only be verified in the
microcanonical ensemble in first-order phase transitions. The CG simulation of
the hPrP heteropolymer yielded a continuous folding transition. The absence of
a free-energy barrier and latent heat favors the presence of partially unfolded
conformations, and in this context, this thermodynamic aspect could explain the
reason why the hPrP heteropolymer is more aggregation-prone than the other
heteropolymers considered in this study. We introduced the hydrophobic radius
of gyration as an order parameter and found that it can be used to obtain
reliable information about the hydrophobic packing and the transition

(1991) 121-156 Gordon & Breach] diffusion (BKR diffusion), neither of which
starts at the origin, and whose natural filtrations agree. The paper commences
by surveying probabilistic coupling, introducing the formal definition of an
immersed coupling (the natural filtration of each component is immersed in a
common underlying filtration; such couplings have been described as co-adapted
or Markovian in older terminologies) and of an equi-filtration coupling (the
natural filtration of each component is immersed in the filtration of the
other; consequently the underlying filtration is simultaneously the natural
filtration for each of the two coupled processes). This survey is followed by a
detailed case-study of the simpler but potentially thematic problem of coupling
Brownian motion together with its local time at $0$. This problem possesses its
own intrinsic interest as well as being closely related to the BKR coupling
construction. Attention focusses on a simple immersed (co-adapted) coupling,
namely the reflection/synchronized coupling. It is shown that this coupling is
optimal amongst all immersed couplings of Brownian motion together with its
local time at $0$, in the sense of maximizing the coupling probability at all
possible times, at least when not started at pairs of initial points lying in a
certain singular set. However numerical evidence indicates that the coupling is
not a maximal coupling, and is a simple but non-trivial instance for which this
distinction occurs. It is shown how the reflection/synchronized coupling can be
converted into a successful equi-filtration coupling, by modifying the coupling
using a deterministic time-delay and then by concatenating an infinite sequence
of such modified couplings. The construction of an explicit equi-filtration
coupling of two copies of the BKR diffusion follows by a direct generalization,
although the proof of success for the BKR coupling requires somewhat more
analysis than in the local time case.

differential rotation on one's ability to correctly recover rotation periods
and differential rotation in the Kepler lightcurves. We confirm that in the
absence of additional constraints on the stellar inclination, such as
spectroscopic measurements of vsini or occultations of starspots by planetary
transits, the spot latitude and stellar inclination are difficult to determine
uniquely from the photometry alone. We find that for models with no
differential rotation, spots that appear on opposite hemispheres of the star
may cause one to interpret the rotation period to be half of the true period.
When differential rotation is included, the changing longitude separation
between spots breaks the symmetry of the hemispheres and the correct rotation
period is more likely to be found. The dominant period found via periodogram
analysis is typically that of the largest spot. Even when multiple spots with
periods representative of the star's differential rotation exist, if one spot
dominates the lightcurve the signal of differential rotation may not be
detectable from the periodogram alone. Starspot modeling is applicable to stars
with a wider range of rotation rates than other surface imaging techniques
(such as Doppler imaging), allows subtle signatures of differential rotation to
be measured, and may provide valuable information on the distribution of
stellar spots. However, given the inherent degeneracies and uncertainty present
in starspot models, caution should be exercised in their interpretation.

constraint satisfaction problem. But despite substantial progress over the past
decade, the threshold for the existence of satisfying assignments is not known
precisely for any $k\geq3$. The best current results, based on the second
moment method, yield upper and lower bounds that differ by an additive $k\cdot
\frac{\ln2}2$, a term that is unbounded in $k$ (Achlioptas, Peres: STOC 2003).
The basic reason for this gap is the inherent asymmetry of the Boolean value
`true' and `false' in contrast to the perfect symmetry, e.g., among the various
colors in a graph coloring problem. Here we develop a new asymmetric second
moment method that allows us to tackle this issue head on for the first time in
the theory of random CSPs. This technique enables us to compute the $k$-SAT
threshold up to an additive $\ln2-\frac12+O(1/k)\approx 0.19$. Independently of
the rigorous work, physicists have developed a sophisticated but non-rigorous
technique called the ""cavity method"" for the study of random CSPs (M\'ezard,
Parisi, Zecchina: Science 2002). Our result matches the best bound that can be
obtained from the so-called ""replica symmetric"" version of the cavity method,
and indeed our proof directly harnesses parts of the physics calculations.

formation that reproduces key observed properties of galaxies at various
redshifts. Including the potential contribution from Population III stars and
following the cosmic reionization history in a simplified way, the model is
also broadly consistent with available data concerning reionization,
particularly the Thomson scattering optical depth constraints from WMAP. In
comparison with previous EBL studies up to z ~ 3-5, our predicted gamma-gamma
opacity is in general agreement for observed gamma-ray energy below 400/(1 + z)
GeV, whereas it is a factor of ~ 2 lower above this energy because of a
correspondingly lower cosmic star formation rate, even though the observed UV
luminosity is well reproduced by virtue of our improved treatment of dust
obscuration and direct estimation of star formation rate. The horizon energy at
which the gamma-ray opacity is unity does not evolve strongly beyond z ~ 4 and
approaches ~ 20 GeV. The contribution of Population III stars is a minor
fraction of the EBL at z = 0, and is also difficult to distinguish through
gamma-ray absorption in high-z objects, even at the highest levels allowed by
the WMAP constraints. Nevertheless, the attenuation due to Population II stars
should be observable in high-z gamma-ray sources by telescopes such as Fermi or
CTA and provide a valuable probe of the evolving EBL in the rest-frame UV. The

into the parental envelope of forming stars. The nearby prototypical and
protobinary low-mass hot core, IRAS16293-2422 (I16293) is ideal for such a
study. The source was targeted with ALMA for science verification purposes in
band 9, which includes CO J=6-5 (E_up/k_B ~ 116 K), at an unprecedented spatial
resolution (~0.2"", 25 AU). I16293 itself is composed of two sources, A and B,
with a projected distance of 5"". CO J=6-5 emission is detected throughout the
region, particularly in small, arcsecond-sized hotspots, where the outflow
interacts with the envelope. The observations only recover a fraction of the
emission in the line wings when compared to data from single-dish telescopes,
with a higher fraction of emission recovered at higher velocities. The very
high angular resolution of these new data reveal that a bow shock from source A
coincides, in the plane of the sky, with the position of source B. Source B, on
the other hand, does not show current outflow activity. In this region, outflow
entrainment takes place over large spatial scales, >~ 100 AU, and in small
discrete knots. This unique dataset shows that the combination of a
high-temperature tracer (e.g., CO J=6-5) and very high angular resolution
observations is crucial for interpreting the structure of the warm inner
environment of low-mass protostars.

asteroseismic data is now available. So-called global oscillation parameters
are inferred to characterize the large sets of stars, to perform ensemble
asteroseismology, and to derive scaling relations. The mean large separation is
such a key parameter. It is therefore crucial to measure it with the highest
accuracy. As the conditions of measurement of the large separation do not
coincide with its theoretical definition, we revisit the asymptotic expressions
used for analysing the observed oscillation spectra. Then, we examine the
consequence of the difference between the observed and asymptotic values of the
mean large separation. The analysis is focused on radial modes. We use series
of radial-mode frequencies to compare the asymptotic and observational values
of the large separation. We propose a simple formulation to correct the
observed value of the large separation and then derive its asymptotic
counterpart. We prove that, apart from glitches due to stellar structure
discontinuities, the asymptotic expansion is valid from main-sequence stars to
red giants. Our model shows that the asymptotic offset is close to 1/4, as in
the theoretical development. High-quality solar-like oscillation spectra
derived from precise photometric measurements are definitely better described
with the second-order asymptotic expansion. The second-order term is
responsible for the curvature observed in the \'echelle diagrams used for
analysing the oscillation spectra and this curvature is responsible for the
difference between the observed and asymptotic values of the large separation.
Taking it into account yields a revision of the scaling relations providing
more accurate asteroseismic estimates of the stellar mass and radius.

suggest the existence of light sterile neutrinos. Meanwhile, current cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) measurements
place an upper bound on the effective number of light neutrinos, $N_{eff}$ and
the PLANCK satellite will measure $N_{eff}$ to a much higher accuracy and
further constrain the number of sterile neutrinos allowed. We demonstrate that
if an MeV dark matter particle couples more strongly to electrons and/or
photons than to neutrinos, then p-wave annihilation after neutrino decoupling
can reduce the value of $N_{eff}$ inferred from BBN and PLANCK. This mechanism
can accommodate two eV sterile neutrinos even if PLANCK observes $N_{eff}$ as
low as the standard model theoretical value of 3.046, and a large neutrino
asymmetry is not needed to obtain the correct primordial element abundances.
The dark matter annihilation also weakens the cosmological upper bounds on the
neutrino masses, and we derive a relationship between the change in these
bounds and the corresponding change in $N_{eff}$. Dark matter with an electric
dipole moment or anapole moment is a natural candidate that exhibits the
desired properties for this mechanism. Coincidentally, a dark matter particle
with these properties and lighter than 3 MeV is precisely one that can explain
the 511 keV gamma-ray line observed by INTEGRAL. We show that the addition of
two eV sterile neutrinos allows this kind of dark matter to be lighter than 3
MeV, which is otherwise ruled out by the CMB bound on $N_{eff}$ if only active
neutrinos are considered.

corrections to curvature perturbations. We point out that this mechanism is
generically at work in a broad class of inflationary models in supergravity

relatively large \alpha. We show that in this regime, the curvature
perturbations produced at the last stages of inflation have a relatively large
amplitude that is of the order of the upper bound set by the possible
production of primordial black holes by non-Gaussian perturbations. On the
other hand, within the supergravity framework described in our paper, the gauge
fields can often acquire a mass through a coupling to additional light scalar
fields. Perturbations of these fields modulate the duration of inflation, which
serves as a source for non-Gaussian perturbations of the metric. In this
regime, the bounds from primordial black holes are parametrically satisfied and
non-Gaussianity of the local type can be generated at the observationally

We estimate that the Roma harbor about 80% West Eurasian ancestry-deriving from
a combination of European and South Asian sources- and that the date of
admixture of South Asian and European ancestry was about 850 years ago. We
provide evidence for Eastern Europe being a major source of European ancestry,
and North-west India being a major source of the South Asian ancestry in the
Roma. By computing allele sharing as a measure of linkage disequilibrium, we
estimate that the migration of Roma out of the Indian subcontinent was

matrix and codewords are structured linear combinations of columns of this
matrix. The proposed encoding algorithm sequentially chooses columns of the
design matrix to successively approximate the source sequence. It is shown to
achieve the optimal distortion-rate function for i.i.d Gaussian sources under
the squared-error distortion criterion. For a given rate, the parameters of the
design matrix can be varied to trade off distortion performance with encoding
complexity. An example of such a trade-off as a function of the block length n
is the following. With computational resource (space or time) per source sample
of O((n/\log n)^2), for a fixed distortion-level above the Gaussian
distortion-rate function, the probability of excess distortion decays
exponentially in n. The Sparse Regression Code is robust in the following
sense: for any ergodic source, the proposed encoder achieves the optimal
distortion-rate function of an i.i.d Gaussian source with the same variance.
Simulations show that the encoder has good empirical performance, especially at
low and moderate rates.

observed galaxy abundances over the ranges 7<log(M*/Msun)<12 and z=0 to z=3 to
be used simultaneously as constraints in the MCMC analysis. When z=0
constraints alone are imposed, we reproduce the results of previous modelling
by Guo et al. (2012), but no single set of parameters can reproduce observed
galaxy abundances at all redshifts simultaneously, reflecting the fact that
low-mass galaxies form too early and thus are overabundant at high redshift in
this model. The data require the efficiency with which galactic wind ejecta are
reaccreted to vary with redshift and halo mass quite differently than
previously assumed, but in a similar way as in some recent hydrodynamic
simulations of galaxy formation. We propose a specific model in which
reincorporation timescales vary inversely with halo mass and are independent of
redshift. This produces an evolving galaxy population which fits observed
abundances as a function of stellar mass, B- and K-band luminosity at all
redshifts simultaneously. It also produces a significant improvement in two
other areas where previous models were deficient. It leads to present day dwarf
galaxy populations which are younger, bluer, more strongly star-forming and
more weakly clustered on small scales than before, although the passive

one of the most puzzling outstanding collider anomalies. After two years of LHC
running, however, few models for tAFB remain consistent with LHC data. In this
paper we take a detailed look at the most promising surviving class of models,
namely light (m_G' <~ 450 GeV), broad axigluons. We show which models
simultaneously satisfy constraints from Tevatron and LHC top measurements,
hadronic resonance searches, and LEP precision electroweak (PEW) observables.
We consider three flavor structures: flavor-universal; down-type nonuniversal,
designed to ease constraints from LHC charge asymmetry measurements; and
top-type nonuniversal, designed to ameliorate constraints from PEW. We compute
contributions to the PEW observables from states in the minimal UV completion
of the axigluon model and demonstrate that new heavy fermions make the
constraints universally more stringent, while related contributions from new
scalars are much smaller, but act to relax the constraints. Paired dijet
searches from ATLAS and CMS rule out all narrow axiglue models, while the LHC
charge asymmetry measurement is less constraining than expected due to the high
central value measured by ATLAS. Excepting the tension with the CMS charge
asymmetry measurement, a broad axigluon is consistent with all data over the
entire mass range we consider (50 GeV <~m_G' <~450 GeV) in the flavor-universal
and top-type nonuniversal models, while it is consistent for m_G' >~200 GeV in
the down-type non-universal model. The LHC charge asymmetry remains the best
avenue for excluding, or observing, these models.

version of a low-mass star formation scenario. We present multi-configuration
VLA 3.6cm and 7mm, as well as CARMA C18O and 3mm continuum observations to
investigate the morphology and kinematics of the ionized gas, dust, and
molecular gas around AFGL2591. We also compare our results to ancillary near-IR
images, and model the SED and 2MASS image profiles of AFGL2591 using a dust
continuum radiative transfer code. The observed 3.6cm images uncover for the
first time that the central powering source AFGL2591-VLA3 has a compact core
plus collimated jet morphology, extending 4000AU eastward from the central
source with an opening angle of <10deg at this radius. However, at 7mm VLA3
does not show a jet morphology, but instead compact (<500AU) emission, some of
which (<0.57 mJy of 2.9mJy) is estimated to be from dust. We determine that the
momentum rate of the jet is not sufficient to ionize itself via only shocks,
and thus a significant portion of the emission is instead likely created in a
photoionized wind. The C18O emission uncovers dense entrained material in the
outflow(s) from the young stars in the region. The main features of the SED and
2MASS images of AFGL2591-VLA3 are also reproduced by our model dust geometry of
a rotationally flattened envelope with and without a disk. The above results
are consistent with a picture of massive star formation similar to that seen
for low-mass protostars. However, within its envelope, AFGL2591-VLA3 contains
at least four other young stars, constituting a small cluster. Therefore it
appears that AFGL2591-VLA3 may be able to source its accreting material from a
shared gas reservoir while still exhibiting the phenomena expected during the
formation of low-mass stars. (Abridged)

burn-in. The resulting scalability is hence influenced by two factors, the MCMC
overheads and the parallelisation costs. In order to efficiently distribute the
MCMC sampling over thousands of cores on modern cloud computing infrastructure,
we developed a Python framework called CosmoHammer which embeds emcee, an
implementation by Foreman-Mackey et al. (2012) of the affine invariant ensemble
sampler by Goodman and Weare (2010). We test the performance of CosmoHammer for
cosmological parameter estimation from cosmic microwave background data. While
Metropolis-Hastings is dominated by overheads, CosmoHammer is able to
accelerate the sampling process from a wall time of 30 hours on a dual core
notebook to 16 minutes by scaling out to 2048 cores. Such short wall times for
complex data sets opens possibilities for extensive model testing and control
of systematics.

stable, one can couple them to such a bath. The resulting plasma effect creates
metastable configurations which can decay from the false vacuum to the true
vacuum. In our specific set-up, the instanton computation is realized for the
case of two out-of-equilibrium complex scalar fields : one is charged and
coupled to the photon field, and the other is neutral. New effects coming from
the thermal bath of photons make the radius of the nucleated bubble and most of
the relevant physical quantities temperature-dependent. However, the
temperature appears in a different way than in the purely thermal case, where
all scalar fields are in thermal equilibrium. As a result of the tunneling, the
core of the initial string melts while bubbles of true vacuum expand at the

also find that stars in the exposed cluster core are less variable than the
stars in the dense, slightly younger, south-western ridge. This trend persists
even after accounting for the underlying correlation with infrared SED type,
suggesting that the change in variable fraction is not simply a reflection of
the change in relative fraction of class I vs. class II sources across the
cloud, but instead reflects a change in variability with age. We also see a
strong correlation between infrared variability and X-ray luminosity among the
class II sources. The observed variability most likely reflects large changes
in the structure of the inner wall located at the dust sublimation radius. We
explore the possibility that these structural perturbations could be caused by
a hot spot on the star heating dust above the sublimation temperature, causing
it to evaporate rapidly, and increasing the inner radius for a portion of the
disk. Under a number of simplifying assumptions we show that this model can
reproduce the size and timescale of the 3.6 and 4.5micron fluctuations.
Regardless of its source, the infrared variability indicates that the inner
disk is not a slowly evolving entity, but instead is a bubbling, warped, dented
mass of gas and dust whose global size and shape fluctuate in a matter of days.

from two or more well-separated sites. If the lens also transits the source
during the event, then its mass can be measured. We derive an analytic

important conclusions. First the rate is directly proportional to the number
density of a given population, greatly favoring low-mass populations relative
to their contribution to the general microlensing rate, which further scales as
sqrt{M} where M is the lens mass. Second, the rate rises sharply as one probes

perform classical thermalization when coupled to a decohering thermal

with programmable spin-spin couplings, an experimental signature which is
consistent with quantum annealing, and at the same time inconsistent with

developed numerical algorithm for multi-dimensional radiation hydrodynamics
based on a variable Eddington tensor as implemented in Athena, focusing on the
regime where scattering opacity greatly exceeds absorption opacity. We find
that the radiation field can reduce the growth and mixing rate of RTI, but this
reduction is only significant when radiation pressure significantly exceeds gas
pressure. Small scale structures are also suppressed in this case. In the
non-linear regime, dense fingers sink faster than rarefied bubbles can rise,
leading to asymmetric structures about the interface. By comparing the
calculations that use a variable Eddington tensor (VET) versus the Eddington
approximation, we demonstrate that anisotropy in the radiation field can affect
the non-linear development of RTI significantly. We also examine the disruption
of a shell of cold gas being accelerated by strong radiation pressure,
motivated by models of radiation driven outflows in ultraluminous infrared
galaxies. We find that when the growth rate of RTI is smaller than acceleration
time scale, the amount of gas that would be pushed away by the radiation field

in systems at the ""edge of chaos."" We study the relationship between dynamics
and computational capability in Random Boolean Networks (RBN) for Reservoir
Computing (RC). RC is a computational paradigm in which a trained readout layer
interprets the dynamics of an excitable component (called the reservoir) that
is perturbed by external input. The reservoir is often implemented as a
homogeneous recurrent neural network, but there has been little investigation
into the properties of reservoirs that are discrete and heterogeneous. Random
Boolean networks are generic and heterogeneous dynamical systems and here we
use them as the reservoir. An RBN is typically a closed system; to use it as a
reservoir we extend it with an input layer. As a consequence of perturbation,
the RBN does not necessarily fall into an attractor. Computational capability
in RC arises from a trade-off between separability and fading memory of inputs.
We find the balance of these properties predictive of classification power and
optimal at critical connectivity. These results are relevant to the
construction of devices which exploit the intrinsic dynamics of complex
heterogeneous systems, such as biomolecular substrates.

Zeeman effect. The maximum spin-polarization current occurs in the forward bias
regime. Such behavior is different from the charge current rectification.
Finally, the Seebeck coefficient ($S$)of SCQDs is calculated and analyzed in
the cases without and with electron phonon interactions. The application of
SCQDs as a temperature detector is discussed on the basis of the nonlinear

equations and some Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Using this theory the
Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), the family of evolutionary Non Linear Schrodinger
(NLS) equations, Kadomtzev-Petviashvili and many more completely integrable
PDEs of mathematical physics are solved, using Zacharv-Shabath scheme. This
last approach includes the use of a Lax pair, and has an advantage to be
applied to wider class of equations, like difference equations, but has a
disadvantage to be used only for ""rapidly decreasing solutions"". This technique
is also intimately related to completely integrable systems. The identifying
process of a Lax pair, a system and finally the ""scattering data"" is usually a
difficult process, simplified in many cases by physicals models providing clues
of how the scattering data should be chosen. In this work we show that the
scattering data can be encoded into singularities of a very special
mathematical object: J-unitary, identity at infinity matrix-valued function,
which, if evolved once, solves the inverse scattering theory, if evolved twice
solves evolutionary PDEs. The provided scheme seems to be universal in the

assume a two-tier pricing model for the buying and selling of electricity from

required to make, 1) Scheduling decisions for the shiftable demands, 2) The
decisions on the amount of energy purchased from the gird by the users, 3) The
decisions on the amount of energy sold to the grid by the users. We formulate a
global centralized optimization problem and obtain the optimal amount of
electricity consumed, sold and purchased for each household, respectively by
assuming the availability of all current and future values of time-varying
parameters. In reality, the lack of perfect information hampers the
implementation of such global centralized optimization. Hence, we propose a
distributed online algorithm which only requires the current values of the
timevarying supply and demand processes. We then compare and determine the
tradeoff between both formulations. Simulation results show that the proposed
schemes can provide effective management for household electricity usage.

minimising total completion time on two parallel identical machines. We argue
why the same problem with three machines is not an easy extension of the

there is an anti-correlation between $\lambda$ and $\Gamma$ for $\lambda
\lesssim 0.01$ in black hole X-ray binaries (with $\lambda=L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm

$\Gamma$ and $\lambda$ within the framework of disk-corona model. We improve
the model by taking into account all cooling processes including synchrotron
and self-Compton radiations in the corona, Comptonization of the soft photons
from the underlying accretion disk, and the Bremsstrahlung radiations.
Presuming that the coronal flow above the disk can reach up to 0.1 Eddington
rate at the outer region, we calculate the structure of the two-phase accretion
flows and the emergent spectra for accretion rates from 0.003 to 0.1. It is
found that at accretion rates larger than $\backsim 0.01$ Eddington rate a
fraction of coronal gas condenses into the disk and an inner disk can be
sustained by condensation. In this case, the X-ray emission is dominated by the
scattering the soft photon from the underlying disk in the corona. The emission
from the inner disk and corona can produce the positive correlation between
$\lambda$ and $\Gamma$. While at accretion rates lower than $\backsim 0.01$
Eddington accretion rate, the inner disk vanishes completely by evaporation,
the accretion is dominated by ADAF, in which the X-ray emission is produced by
the Comptonization of the synchrotron and bremsstrahlung photons of ADAF
itself. The emission from ADAF can produce the anti-correlation between

is generally not well documented in the literature. It is the goal of this
paper to investigate to which extent such recent techniques can be successfully
used for the tuning of both the regularisation and kernel parameters in support
vector regression (SVR) and the complexity measure in regression trees (CART).
This task is traditionally solved via V-fold cross-validation (VFCV), which
gives efficient results for a reasonable computational cost. A disadvantage
however of VFCV is that the procedure is known to provide an asymptotically
suboptimal risk estimate as the number of examples tends to infinity. Recently,
a penalisation procedure called V-fold penalisation has been proposed to
improve on VFCV, supported by theoretical arguments. Here we report on an
extensive set of experiments comparing V-fold penalisation and VFCV for
SVR/CART calibration on several benchmark datasets. We highlight cases in which
VFCV and V-fold penalisation provide poor estimates of the risk respectively

acting on the dual polytope P^* (much like cluster transformations). Mutations
map Fano polytopes to Fano polytopes, preserve the Ehrhart series of the dual

Minkowski polynomials, which are a family of Laurent polynomials that give
mirror partners to many three-dimensional Fano manifolds, are connected by a
sequence of mutations if and only if they have the same period.

Snapshots provide rapid deployment, migration between hosts, dependability
(fault tolerance), and security (insulating a guest VM from the host). Yet, for
each virtual machine, the code for snapshots is laboriously developed on a
per-VM basis. This work demonstrates a generic checkpoint-restart mechanism for
virtual machines. The mechanism is based on a plugin on top of an unmodified
user-space checkpoint-restart package, DMTCP. Checkpoint-restart is
demonstrated for three virtual machines: Lguest, user-space QEMU, and KVM/QEMU.
The plugins for Lguest and KVM/QEMU require just 200 lines of code. The Lguest
kernel driver API is augmented by 40 lines of code. DMTCP checkpoints
user-space QEMU without any new code. KVM/QEMU, user-space QEMU, and DMTCP need
no modification. The design benefits from other DMTCP features and plugins.
Experiments demonstrate checkpoint and restart in 0.2 seconds using forked
checkpointing, mmap-based fast-restart, and incremental Btrfs-based snapshots.

of size at least $k$ such that $P$ is not p-bounded on the set of all

  We consider two more general search problems involving finding a hard
formula, {\bf Cert} and {\bf Find}, motivated by two hypothetical situations:
that one can prove that $\np \neq co\np$ and that no optimal proof system
exists. In {\bf Cert} one is asked to find a witness that a given
non-deterministic circuit with $k$ inputs does not define $TAUT \cap \kk$. In
{\bf Find}, given $1^{(k)}$ and a tautology $\alpha$ of size at most $k^{c_0}$,
one should output a size $k$ tautology $\beta$ that has no size $k^{c_1}$
$P$-proof from substitution instances of $\alpha$.
  We shall prove, assuming the existence of an exponentially hard one-way
permutation, that {\bf Cert} cannot be solved by a time $2^{O(k)}$ algorithm.
Using a stronger hypothesis about the proof complexity of Nisan-Wigderson

only partially defined for infinitely many $k$ (i.e. there are inputs
corresponding to $k$ for which the problem has no solution). The results are

task in statistical functional analysis. In general, functional data contains
both phase (or x or horizontal) and amplitude (or y or vertical) variability.
Tradi- tional methods often ignore the phase variability and focus solely on
the amplitude variation, using cross-sectional techniques such as fPCA for
dimensional reduction and data modeling. Ignoring phase variability leads to a
loss of structure in the data and inefficiency in data models. This paper
presents an approach that relies on separating the phase (x-axis) and amplitude
(y-axis), then modeling these components using joint distributions. This
separation, in turn, is performed using a technique called elastic shape
analysis of curves that involves a new mathematical representation of
functional data. Then, using individual fPCAs, one each for phase and amplitude
components, while respecting the nonlinear geometry of the phase representation
space; impose joint probability models on principal coefficients of these
components. These ideas are demonstrated using random sampling, for models
estimated from simulated and real datasets, and show their superiority over
models that ignore phase-amplitude separation. Furthermore, the generative
models are applied to classification of functional data and achieve high
performance in applications involv- ing SONAR signals of underwater objects,
handwritten signatures, and periodic body movements recorded by smart phones.

The gravitational
potential of a planet perturbs the disk and leads to characteristic structures,
i.e. spiral waves and gaps, in the disk's density profile. We perform a
large-scale parameter study of the observability of these planet-induced
structures in circumstellar disks with ALMA. On the basis of HD and MHD
simulations, we calculated the disk temperature structure and (sub)mm images of
these systems. These were used to derive simulated ALMA images. Because
appropriate objects are frequent in Taurus, we focused on a distance of 140pc
and a declination of 20{\deg}. The explored range of star-disk-planet
configurations consists of 6 HD simulations (including magnetic fields and
different planet masses), 9 disk sizes, 15 total disk masses, 6 different
central stars, and two different grain size distributions. On almost all scales
and in particular down to a scale of a few AU, ALMA is able to trace disk
structures induced by planet-disk interaction or by the influence of magnetic
fields on the wavelength range between 0.4 and 2.0mm. In most cases, the
optimum angular resolution is limited by the sensitivity. However, within the
range of typical masses of protoplanetary disks (0.1-0.001Msun) the disk mass
has a minor impact on the observability. It is possible to resolve disks down
to 2.67e-6Msun and trace gaps induced by a planet with M_p/M_s = 0.001 in disks
with 2.67e-4Msun with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than three. The central
star has a major impact on the observability of gaps, as well as the considered
maximum grainsize of the dust in the disk. In general, it is more likely to
trace planet-induced gaps in our MHD models, because gaps are wider in the
presence of magnetic fields. We also find that zonal flows resulting from MRI
create gap-like structures in the disk's re-emission radiation, which are
observable with ALMA.

means a softer spectrum, at HXR footpoint sources with stronger magnetic field
than that at the loop tops. These results suggest that the electron spectra are
bent at around several hundreds of keV, and become harder at the higher energy
range that contributes the microwave gyrosynchrotron emission.

We consider the interaction between the light-induced dipoles of particles. In
the presence of a magnetic field, the simplest achiral cluster, a dimer,
exhibits circular dichroism (CD). The CD of a dimer depends on the directions
of the magnetic field and the light wave vector. The CD of a populous cluster
weakly depends on the magnetic field. Upon scattering from the cluster, an
incident linearly polarized light with polarization azimuth $\varphi$, becomes
elliptically polarized. The polarization azimuth rotation and ellipticity angle
variation are sinusoidal functions of $2 \varphi$. The anisotropy and the
chirality of the cluster control the amplitude and offset of these sinusoidal
functions. The Faraday rotation and Faraday ellipticity are also sinusoidal
functions of $2 \varphi$. Near the surface plasmon frequency, Faraday rotation
and Faraday ellipticity increase.

directly are based on two-way speed measurement. The challenge in one-way speed
measurement, the requirement of spatially separated synchronised clocks, can be
possibly circumvented by measuring the speed of light travelling in a closed
path. An apparent violation of the invariance principle has been recently
reported in the first experiment attempting to measure the one-way speed of
light utilising this concept. This experiment is reanalysed here. It is found
that the results of the experiment can be explained within the framework of
relativity, without requiring any violation of the invariance principle.

shown that compactness is equivalent to sequential compactness on the fuzzy
number space equipped with the level convergence topology. Diamond and Kloeden
gave a characterization of compact sets in fuzzy number spaces equipped with
the supremum metric, Fang and Xue also gave a characterization of compact sets
in one-dimensional fuzzy number spaces equipped with supremum metric. The
latter characterization is just the one-dimensional case of the former
characterization. There exists conflict between the characterization given by
us and the characterizations given by the above mentioned authors. We point out
the characterizations gave by them is incorrect by a counterexample.

data violates this assumption. To capture non-Poissonian features, in order to
fix the inevitable inherent irregularity, researchers rescale the time axis
with tedious computational overhead instead of searching for another
distribution. Spikes or action potentials are precisely-timed changes in the
ionic transport through synapses adjusting the synaptic weight, successfully
modeled and developed as a memristor. Memristance value is multiples of initial
resistance. This reminds us with the foundations of quantum mechanics. We try
to quantize potential and resistance, as done with energy. After reviewing
Planck curve for blackbody radiation, we propose the quantization equations. We
introduce and prove a theorem that quantizes the resistance. Then we define the
tyke showing its basic characteristics. Finally we give the basic
transformations to model spiking and link an energy quantum to a tyke.
Investigation shows how this perfectly models the neuron spiking, with over 97%
match.

of the former to the later. Then we test this assumption to see that this
provides a concise working model. This paper collects some heuristics that we
call them SpiroPlanck and employs them to model the coverage of dense networks.
In this paper, we propose a framework for the operation of FI testbeds
containing a test scenario, new representation and visualization techniques,
and possible performance measures. Investigations show that it is very
promising and could be seen as a good optimization
