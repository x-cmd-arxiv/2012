spectrum of NGC 7009, in the context of the bi-abundance nebular model proposed
by Liu et al. (2000). The observed relative intensities are compared with the
theoretical predictions based on high quality effective recombination
coefficients, now available for the recombination line spectrum of a number of
heavy element ions. The possibility of plasma diagnostics using the optical
recombination lines (ORLs) of heavy element ions is discussed in detail. Plasma
diagnostics based on the N II and O II recombination spectra both yield
electron temperatures close to 1000 K, which is lower than those derived from
the collisionally excited line (CEL) ratios by nearly one order of magnitude.
The very low temperatures yielded by the O II and N II ORLs indicate that they
originate from very cold regions. The C^{2+}/H^+, N^{2+}/H^+, O^{2+}/H^+ and
Ne^{2+}/H^+ ionic abundance ratios derived from ORLs are consistently higher,
by about a factor of 5, than the corresponding values derived from CELs. In
calculating the ORL ionic abundance ratios, we have used the newly available
high quality effective recombination coefficients, and adopted an electron
temperature of 1000 K, as given by the ORL diagnostics and as a consequence
presumably representing the physical conditions prevailing in the regions where
the heavy element ORLs arise. A comparison of the results of plasma diagnostics
and abundance determinations for NGC 7009 points to the existence of ""cold"",
metal-rich (i.e. H-deficient) inclusions embedded in the hot, diffuse ionized
gas, first postulated by Liu et al. (2000).

are becoming increasingly popular. Despite their popularity, mathematical
analysis of these algorithms lacks behind. Convergence analysis still remains
unsolved for the majority of metaheuristic algorithms, while efficiency
analysis is equally challenging. In this paper, we intend to provide an
overview of convergence and efficiency studies of metaheuristics, and try to
provide a framework for analyzing metaheuristics in terms of convergence and

CeFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$AsO and GdFe$_{1-y}$Co$_y$AsO, which correspond to two very
different cases of $4f$-magnetic moment. Both CeFeAsO and GdFeAsO undergo a
spin-density-wave (SDW) transition associated with Fe 3d electrons at high
temperatures, which is rapidly suppressed by Fe/Co substitution.
Superconductivity appears in a narrow doping range: $0.05 < x < 0.2$ for
CeFe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$AsO and $0.05 < y < 0.25$ for GdFe$_{1-y}$Co$_y$AsO, showing
a maximum transition temperature $T_\textup{sc}$ of about 13.5 K for Ce and 19
K for Gd. In both compounds, the $4f$-electrons form an antiferromagnetic (AFM)
order at low temperatures over the entire doping range and Co 3d electrons are
ferromagnetically ordered on the Co-rich side; the Curie temperature reaches
$T_\textup{C}^\textup{Co} \approx$ 75 K at $x = 1$ and $y = 1$. In the
Ce-compounds, the N\'{e}el temperature $T_\textup{N}^\textup{Ce}$ increases
upon suppressing the SDW transition of Fe and then remains nearly unchanged
with further increasing Co concentration up to $x \simeq 0.8$
($T_\textup{N}^\textup{Ce}\approx$ 4 K). Furthermore, evidence of Co-induced
polarization on Ce-moments is observed on the Co-rich side. In the
Gd-compounds, the two magnetic species of Gd and Co are coupled
antiferromagnetically to give rise to ferrimagnetic behavior in the magnetic
susceptibility on the Co-rich side. For $0.7 \leq y < 1.0$, the system
undergoes a possible magnetic reorientation below the N\'{e}el temperature of
Gd ($T_\textup{N}^\textup{Gd}$). Our results suggest that the effects of both
electron hybridizations and magnetic exchange coupling between the 3d-4f
electrons give rise to a rich phase diagram in the rare-earth iron pnictides.

overall simplification of computing systems, including software. As a theory
with a broad base of support, the SP theory promises useful insights in many
areas and the integration of structures and functions, both within a given area
and amongst different areas. There are potential benefits in natural language
processing (with potential for the understanding and translation of natural
languages), the need for a versatile intelligence in autonomous robots,
computer vision, intelligent databases, maintaining multiple versions of

management of big data and gaining benefits from it, the semantic web, medical

one-dimensional extractions of effective parameters from reflection and
transmission measurements, and two-dimensional prism-based measurements that
convincingly show the transmission angle corresponding to negative refraction.
The transmission angles observed in the latter case also agree very well with
the refractive index obtained in the one-dimensional measurements and numerical
simulations. We expect this labyrinthine metamaterial to become the unit cell
of choice for practical acoustic metamaterial devices that require broadband
and significantly negative indexes of refraction.

which we define here as non-BMI (NBMI) type clusters. We find that for 71 BMI
clusters the absolute K-band luminosity of cDs depends on the cluster richness,
but less strongly on the cluster velocity dispersion. Meanwhile, for 35 NBMI
clusters the correlation between cD luminosity and cluster richness is weaker,
and is absent between cD luminosity and velocity dispersion. In addition, we
find that the luminosity of the cD galaxy hosted in BMI clusters tends to
increase with the cD's peculiar velocity with respect to the cluster mean
velocity. In contrast, for NBMI clusters the cD luminosity decreases with
increasing peculiar velocity. Also, the X-ray luminosity of BMI clusters
depends on the cluster velocity dispersion, while in NBMI clusters such a
correlation is absent. These findings favour the cannibalism scenario for the
formation of cD galaxies. We suggest that cDs in clusters of BMI type were
formed and evolved preferentially in one and the same cluster. In contrast, cDs
in NBMI type clusters were either originally formed in clusters that later
merged with groups or clusters to form the current cluster, or are now in the
process of merging.

be approximated by applying an appropriate estimator to the sample. The
effectiveness of sampling, however, hinges on estimator selection. The choice
of estimators is subjected to global requirements, such as unbiasedness and
range restrictions on the estimate value, and ideally, we seek estimators that
are both efficient to derive and apply and {\em admissible} (not dominated, in
terms of variance, by other estimators). Nevertheless, for a given data domain,
sampling scheme, and query, there are many admissible estimators. We study the
choice of admissible nonnegative and unbiased estimators for monotone sampling
schemes. Monotone sampling schemes are implicit in many applications of massive
data set analysis. Our main contribution is general derivations of admissible
estimators with desirable properties. We present a construction of {\em
order-optimal} estimators, which minimize variance according to {\em any}
specified priorities over the data domain. Order-optimality allows us to
customize the derivation to common patterns that we can learn or observe in the
data. When we prioritize lower values (e.g., more similar data sets when
estimating difference), we obtain the L$^*$ estimator, which is the unique
monotone admissible estimator. We show that the L$^*$ estimator is
4-competitive and dominates the classic Horvitz-Thompson estimator. These
properties make the L$^*$ estimator a natural default choice. We also present
the U$^*$ estimator, which prioritizes large values (e.g., less similar data
sets). Our estimator constructions are both easy to apply and possess desirable
properties, allowing us to make the most from our summarized data.

Somewhat surprisingly, we find for 0<alpha<1, that the only inequality is
non-negativity: In other words, any collection of non-negative numbers assigned
to the nonempty subsets of n parties can be arbitrarily well approximated by
the alpha-entropies of the 2^n-1 marginals of a quantum state.

particular no linear) inequalities. On the other hand, it is known that there
are further, non-linear and indeed non-homogeneous, inequalities delimiting the
alpha-entropies of a general quantum state.
  Finally, we also treat the case of Renyi entropies restricted to classical
states (i.e. probability distributions), which in addition to non-negativity
are also subject to monotonicity. For alpha different from 0 and 1 we show that
this is the only other homogeneous relation.

solutions of second order fully nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)

monotone, consistent, and stable finite difference methods for first order
fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations to second order fully nonlinear PDEs
such as Monge-Amp\`ere and Bellman type equations. New concepts of consistency,
generalized monotonicity, and stability are introduced; among them, the
generalized monotonicity and consistency, which are easier to verify in
practice, are natural extensions of the corresponding notions of finite
difference methods for first order fully nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations.
The main component of the proposed framework is the concept of ""numerical
operator"", and the main idea used to design consistent, monotone and stable
finite difference methods is the concept of ""numerical moment"". These two new
concepts play the same roles as the ""numerical Hamiltonian"" and the ""numerical
viscosity"" play in the finite difference framework for first order fully

and monotone finite difference methods are proposed for second order fully
nonlinear PDEs. The first class contains Lax-Friedrichs-like methods which also
are proved to be stable and the second class contains Godunov-like methods.
Numerical results are also presented to gauge the performance of the proposed
finite difference methods and to validate the theoretical results of the paper.

crucial to outcome of these dynamical transients. To elucidate the phenomenon,
we study the dynamics of voltage and power flows in a spatially-extended
distribution feeder (circuit) connecting many asynchronous induction motors and
discover that this relatively simple 1+1 (space+time) dimensional system
exhibits a plethora of nontrivial spatio-temporal effects, some of which may be
dangerous for power system stability. Long-range motor-motor interactions
mediated by circuit voltage and electrical power flows result in coexistence
and segregation of spatially-extended phases defined by individual motor
states--a ""normal"" state where the motors' mechanical (rotation) frequency is
slightly smaller than the nominal frequency of the basic AC flows and a
""stalled"" state where the mechanical frequency is small. Transitions between
the two states can be initiated by a perturbation of the voltage or base
frequency at the head of the distribution feeder. Such behavior is typical of
first-order phase transitions in physics, and this 1+1 dimensional model shows
many other properties of a first-order phase transition with the spatial
distribution of the motors' mechanical frequency playing the role of the order
parameter. In particular we observe (a) propagation of the phase-transition
front with the constant speed very long feeders; and (b) hysteresis in
transitions between the normal and stalled (or partially stalled) phases.

formulation of the underlying PDE, embeds a nonlinear problem into a mostly
linear system of equations where the nonlinearity has been modified to include
multiple values of the second order derivative $u_{xx}$. The proposed framework
extends a companion finite difference framework developed by the authors in [9]
and allows for the approximation of fully nonlinear PDEs using high order
polynomials and non-uniform meshes.In addition to the nonstandard mixed
formulation setting, another main idea is to replace the fully nonlinear
differential operator by a numerical operator, which is consistent with the
differential operator and satisfies certain monotonicity (called
g-monotonicity) properties. To ensure such a g-monotonicity, the crux of the
construction is to introduce the numerical moment, which plays a critical role
in the proposed DG framework. This paper also presents and analyzes numerical
results for several numerical test problems which are used to guage the
accuracy and efficiency of the proposed DG methods.

to M*+1 in a sample of 6 self-similar SDSS galaxy clusters at z=0.07. These
clusters are specifically selected to lack significant substructure at bright
limits in their central regions so that we are largely able to eliminate the
local action of merging clusters on the frequency of AGN. We demonstrate that
the AGN fraction increases significantly from the cluster centre to 1.5Rvirial,
but tails off at larger radii. If only comparing the cluster core region to
regions at ~2Rvirial, no significant variation would be found. We compute the
AGN fraction by mass and show that massive galaxies (log(stellar mass)>10.7)
are host to a systematically higher fraction of AGN than lower mass galaxies at
all radii from the cluster centre. We attribute this deficit of AGN in the
cluster centre to the changing mix of galaxy types with radius. We use the WHAN
diagnostic to separate weak AGN from `retired' galaxies in which the main
ionization mechanism comes from old stellar populations. These retired AGN are
found at all radii, while the mass effect is much more pronounced: we find that
massive galaxies are more likely to be in the retired class. Further, we show
that our AGN have no special position inside galaxy clusters - they are neither
preferentially located in the infall regions, nor situated at local maxima of
galaxy density. However, we find that the most powerful AGN (with [OIII]
equivalent widths <-10Ang) reside at significant velocity offsets in the
cluster, and this brings our analysis into agreement with previous work on
X-ray selected AGN. Our results suggest that if interactions with other
galaxies are responsible for triggering AGN activity, the time-lag between
trigger and AGN enhancement must be sufficiently long to obfuscate the
encounter site and wipe out the local galaxy density signal.

utilizes information and market recourse to reduce reserve capacity

of the optimal storage operation. Simple approximations that rely on
continuous-time approximations of the solution for the discrete time control

is quantified. Numerical experiments illustrate the proposed procedures.

interactions. The cross-sections for electron bremsstrahlung and photon pair
conversion are suppressed at high energies, by the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal
(LPM) effect, lengthening electromagnetic showers. At still higher energies
(above $10^{20}$ eV), photonuclear and electronuclear interactions dominate,
and showers become predominantly hadronic. Muons interact much less strongly,
so can travel long distances through solids before losing energy. Tau leptons
behave similarly, although their short livetime limits how far they can travel.
The hadronic interaction cross-section is believed to continue to increase
slowly with rising energy; measurements of cosmic-ray air showers support this
prediction.

transmission via relay cooperation in two-hop relay wireless networks without
the information of both eavesdropper channels and locations. While previous
work on this problem mainly studied infinite networks and their asymptotic
behavior and scaling law results, this papers focuses on a more practical
network with finite number of system nodes and explores the corresponding exact
result on the number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerant to ensure
desired secrecy and reliability. We first study the scenario where path-loss is
equal between all pairs of nodes and consider two transmission protocols there,
one adopts an optimal but complex relay selection process with less load
balance capacity while the other adopts a random but simple relay selection
process with good load balance capacity. Theoretical analysis is then provided
to determine the maximum number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate to
ensure a desired performance in terms of the secrecy outage probability and
transmission outage probability. We further extend our study to the more
general scenario where path-loss between each pair of nodes also depends the
distance between them, for which a new transmission protocol with both
preferable relay selection and good load balance as well as the corresponding
theoretical analysis are presented.

contrast, blur and diminished colors. In this paper, we proposed an image based
preprocessing technique to enhance the quality of the underwater images. The
proposed technique comprises a combination of four filters such as homomorphic
filtering, wavelet denoising, bilateral filter and contrast equalization. These
filters are applied sequentially on degraded underwater images. The literature
survey reveals that image based preprocessing algorithms uses standard filter
techniques with various combinations. For smoothing the image, the image based
preprocessing algorithms uses the anisotropic filter. The main drawback of the
anisotropic filter is that iterative in nature and computation time is high
compared to bilateral filter. In the proposed technique, in addition to other
three filters, we employ a bilateral filter for smoothing the image. The
experimentation is carried out in two stages. In the first stage, we have
conducted various experiments on captured images and estimated optimal
parameters for bilateral filter. Similarly, optimal filter bank and optimal
wavelet shrinkage function are estimated for wavelet denoising. In the second
stage, we conducted the experiments using estimated optimal parameters, optimal
filter bank and optimal wavelet shrinkage function for evaluating the proposed
technique. We evaluated the technique using quantitative based criteria such as
a gradient magnitude histogram and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR). Further,
the results are qualitatively evaluated based on edge detection results. The
proposed technique enhances the quality of the underwater images and can be
employed prior to apply computer vision techniques.

of linear queries over histograms. This is a rich class of queries that
includes contingency tables and range queries, and has been a focus of a long
line of work. For a set of $d$ linear queries over a database $x \in \R^N$, we
seek to find the differentially private mechanism that has the minimum mean
squared error. For pure differential privacy, an $O(\log^2 d)$ approximation to
the optimal mechanism is known. Our first contribution is to give an $O(\log^2
d)$ approximation guarantee for the case of $(\eps,\delta)$-differential
privacy. Our mechanism is simple, efficient and adds correlated Gaussian noise
to the answers. We prove its approximation guarantee relative to the hereditary
discrepancy lower bound of Muthukrishnan and Nikolov, using tools from convex
geometry.
  We next consider this question in the case when the number of queries exceeds
the number of individuals in the database, i.e. when $d > n \triangleq
\|x\|_1$. It is known that better mechanisms exist in this setting. Our second
main contribution is to give an $(\eps,\delta)$-differentially private
mechanism which is optimal up to a $\polylog(d,N)$ factor for any given query
set $A$ and any given upper bound $n$ on $\|x\|_1$. This approximation is
achieved by coupling the Gaussian noise addition approach with a linear
regression step. We give an analogous result for the $\eps$-differential
privacy setting. We also improve on the mean squared error upper bound for
answering counting queries on a database of size $n$ by Blum, Ligett, and Roth,
and match the lower bound implied by the work of Dinur and Nissim up to
logarithmic factors.
  The connection between hereditary discrepancy and the privacy mechanism
enables us to derive the first polylogarithmic approximation to the hereditary
discrepancy of a matrix $A$.

achieved simply by considering the entropically most important subspace. This
conclusion effectively converts an exhaustive sampling problem into a local

least at the 3$\sigma$ confidence levels (CLs), which implies that the NADE
model distinctly favors an open universe. Besides, our results show that the
value of the key parameter of NADE model,

where its best-fit value is significantly smaller than those obtained in

different SNIa samples used. Our further test indicates that there is a
distinct tension between the Union2 sample of SNIa and other observations, and
the tension will be relieved once the Union2 sample is replaced by the Union2.1
sample. So, the new constraint result of the NADE model obtained in this work
is more reasonable than before.

We found that the lattice distortion ((c-a)/a) of L10 martensite monotonously
changes with the substitution of Mn for Ga atoms and shows a kink behavior at
Ga(at.%)= 25 due to the weakened covalent effect between main-group and
transition-metal atoms. Moreover, owing to the competition between covalence
hybridization and magnetic ordering of introduced Mn atoms, the molecular
magnetic moment and Curie temperature coincidently show maximums at Ga(at.%)=25

the strength of covalent hybridization. The results therefore suggest that
careful control of the concentration of main-group atoms in Heusler alloys can

extinction map constructed by Schlegel, Finkbeiner & Davis (1998). We select
~10^7 galaxies in total from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR7
photometric catalog. We detect clear signatures of the enhancement of the
extinction in r-band, $\Delta A_r$, around galaxies, indicating that the
extinction map is contaminated by their FIR (far infrared) emission. The
average amplitude of the contamination per galaxy is well fitted to $\Delta
A_r(m_r) = 0.64 \times 10^{0.17(18-m_r)}$ [mmag]. While this value is very
small, it is directly associated with galaxies and may have a systematic effect
on galaxy statistics. Indeed this correlated contamination leads to a
relatively large anomaly of galaxy surface number densities against the SFD
extinction A_SFD discovered by Yahata et al. (2007). We model the radial
profiles of stacked galaxy images, and find that the FIR signal around each
galaxy does not originate from the central galaxy alone, but is dominated by
the contributions of nearby galaxies via galaxy angular clustering. The
separation of the single galaxy and the clustering terms enables us to infer
the statistical relation of the FIR and r-band fluxes of galaxies and also to
probe the flux-weighted cross-correlation of galaxies, down to the magnitudes
that are difficult to probe directly for individual objects. We repeat the same
stacking analysis for SDSS DR6 photometric quasars and discovered the similar
signatures but with weaker amplitudes. The implications of the present results
for galaxy and quasar statistics and for correction to the Galactic extinction
map are briefly discussed.

single (a white dwarf accreting from a non-degenerate companion) and double

the binary evolution process leading to such a progenitor system. We aim to get
a better insight into uncertainties and parameter spaces by means of a combined
modelization, resulting in a reduction of the number of possible model
approaches. This exclusion of parts of the parameter space is, as will be
shown, often independent of uncertainties in the modelization. We use the
combination of a population synthesis code with detailed binary evolution and a
galactic chemical evolution model to predict the metallicity distribution of
G-type dwarfs in the solar neighborhood. Because of the very long lifetime of
these stars, this distribution is a good indicator of the entire chemical
history of a region. By comparing the observed distribution with those
predicted by assuming different type Ia supernova progenitors and evolutionary
parameters (e.g. concerning mass and angular momentum loss and common envelope
evolution), it is possible to constrain the possible combinations of
assumptions. We find that in order to reproduce the observed G-dwarf
metallicity distribution, it is absolutely necessary to include both the single
and double degenerate scenario. The best match is obtained when all merging C-O
white dwarfs contribute to the latter. The correspondence is also critically
dependent on the assumptions about galaxy and star formation, e.g. the use of
the two-infall model vs. a constant star formation rate. However, this does not
affect the previous conclusion, which is consistent with the results obtained
by investigating type Ia supernova delay time distributions in starburst

intermittent pulsar B1931+24 to further elucidate its behaviour. We find that
while the source exhibits a wide range of nulling (~4-39 d) and radio-emitting
(~1-19 d) timescales, it cycles between its different emission phases over an
average timescale of approximately 38 d, which is remarkably stable over many
years. On average, the neutron star is found to be radio emitting for 26 +- 6 %
of the time. No evidence is obtained to suggest that the pulsar undergoes any
systematic, intrinsic variations in pulse intensity during the radio-emitting
phases. In addition, we find no evidence for any correlation between the length
of consecutive emission phases. An analysis of the rotational behaviour of the
source shows that it consistently assumes the same spin-down rates, i.e. nudot
= -16 +- 1 x 10^-15 s^-2 when emitting and nudot = -10.8 +- 0.4 x 10^-15 s^-2
when not emitting, over the entire observation span. Coupled with the stable
switching timescale, this implies that the pulsar retains a high degree of
magnetospheric memory, and stability, in spite of comparatively rapid (~ms)
dynamical plasma timescales. While this provides further evidence to suggest
that the behaviour of the neutron star is governed by magnetospheric-state
switching, the underlying trigger mechanism remains illusive. This should be
elucidated by future surveys with next generation telescopes such as LOFAR,
MeerKAT and the SKA, which should detect similar sources and provide more clues
to how their radio emission is regulated.

core. XMM-Newton maps of the clusters show excess X-ray emission from an
overlapping region between them. Spectrally determined projected temperature
and entropy maps do not show any signs of cluster scale mergers either in the
overlapping region or in any of the clusters. In A3532, however, some signs of
the presence of galaxy scale mergers are visible e.g., anisotropic temperature
variations in the projected thermodynamic maps, a wide angled tailed (WAT)
radio source in the brighter nucleus of its dumbbell Brightest Cluster Galaxy
(BCG), and a candidate X-ray cavity coincident with the northwestern extension
of the WAT source in the low-frequency radio observations. The northwestern
extension in A3532 seems either a part of the WAT or an unrelated diffuse
source in A3532 or in the background. There is an indication that the cool core
in A3532 has been disrupted by the central AGN activity. A reanalysis of the
redshift data reinforces the close proximity of the clusters. The excess
emission in the overlapping region appears to be a result of tidal interactions
as the two clusters approach each other for the first time. However, we can not
rule out the possibility of the excess being due to the chance superposition of
their X-ray halos.

holes) are thought to be progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts and sources of
gravitational waves, hence their study is of great importance for astrophysics.
Because of the strong magnetic field of one or both binary members and high
orbital frequencies, these binaries are strong sources of energy in the form of
Poynting flux (e.g., magnetic-field-dominated outflows, relativistic leptonic
winds, electromagnetic and plasma waves). The steady injection of energy by the
binary forms a bubble (or a cavity) filled with matter with the relativistic
equation of state, which pushes on the surrounding plasma and can drive a shock
wave in it. Unlike the Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor blast wave solution for a
point-like explosion, the shock wave here is continuously driven by the
ever-increasing pressure inside the bubble. We calculate from the first
principles the dynamics and evolution of the bubble and the shock surrounding
it and predict that such systems can be observed as radio sources a few hours
before and after the merger. At much later times, the shock is expected to
settle onto the Sedov-von Neumann-Taylor solution, thus resembling an
explosion.

discussed in the framework of the Hamiltonian formalism. Starting from the
Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a Lagrangian density that contains two
components - one corresponding to a scalar field Lagrangian,
${\mathcal{L}}_{\phi}$, and another that depends on the scale parameter,
${\mathcal{L}}_{a}$ - one can identify a generalized Hamiltonian density from
which first-order dynamical equations can be obtained. This set up corresponds
to the dynamics of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker models in the presence of
homogeneous fields embedded into a generalized cosmological background fluid in
a system that evolves all together isentropically. Once the generalized
Hamiltonian density is properly defined, the constraints on the
gravity-matter-field system are straightforwardly obtained through the
first-order Hamilton equations. The procedure is illustrated for three examples
of cosmological interest for studies of the dark sector: real scalar fields,
tachyonic fields and generalized Born-Infeld tachyonic fields. The inclusion of
some isentropic fluid component into the Friedmann equation allows for
identifying an exact correspondence between the dark sector underlying scalar
field and an ordinary real scalar field dynamics. As a final issue, the
Hamiltonian formulation is used to set the first-order dynamical equations
through which one obtains the exact analytical description of the cosmological
evolution of a generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) with dustlike matter, radiation
or curvature contributions. Model stability in terms of the square of the sound
velocity, $c_{s}^{2}$, cosmic acceleration, $q$, and conditions for inflation

characteristic zero and let G be a finite abelian group. Regev and Seeman
introduced the notion of a regular G-grading on A, namely a grading A=
{\Sigma}_{g in G} A_g that satisfies the following two conditions:
  (1) for every integer n>=1 and every n-tuple (g_1,g_2,...,g_n) in G^n, there
are elements, a_i in A_{g_i}, i=1,...,n, such that a_1*a_2*...*a_n != 0.
  (2) for every g,h in G and for every a_g in A_g,b_h in A_h, we have
a_{g}b_{h}=theta(g,h)b_{h}a_{g}.
  Then later, Bahturin and Regev conjectured that if the grading on A is
regular and minimal, then the order of the group G is an invariant of the
algebra. In this article we prove the conjecture by showing that ord(G)
coincides with an invariant of A which appears in PI theory, namely exp(A) (the
exponent of A). Moreover, we extend the whole theory to (finite) nonabelian
groups and show that the above result holds also in that case.

we show that two well-known spin chains, namely the XY chain and the transverse
field Ising chain with only next-nearest-neighbor interactions, differ at their
critical points only by a non-local boundary term and can be related via an
exact mapping. The boundary term constrains the set of possible boundary
conditions of the transverse field Ising chain, reducing the number of primary
fields in the conformal field theory that describes its critical behavior. We
argue that the reduction of the field content is equivalent to the confinement
of a set of primary fields, in precise analogy to the confinement of
quasiparticles resulting from a condensation of a boson in a topological phase.
As the second example we show that when a similar confining boundary term is
applied to the XY chain with only next-nearest-neighbor interactions, the
resulting system can be mapped to a local spin chain with the u(1)_2 x u(1)_2
critical behavior predicted by the condensation framework.

based on an underlying Markov chain to represent the evolution of a latent

variables observed at the different occasions are assumed to be conditionally
independent given this chain. Maximum likelihood of the model is carried out
through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm based on forward-backward

penalized versions of the maximum log-likelihood or on the posterior
probabilities of belonging to each latent state, that is the conditional
probability of the latent state given the observed data. A Monte Carlo
simulation study shows that the indices referred to the log-likelihood based

to the classification based criteria. This is due to the fact that the latter
tend to underestimate the true number of latent states, especially in the

the new proof of Borcherds' theorem on the infinite product expansions of
integer weight modular forms on $\SL_2(\ZZ)$ with a Heegner divisor. These good
bases appear in pairs, and they satisfy a striking duality, which is now called
the Zagier duality. After the result of Zagier, this type duality was studied
broadly in various view points including the theory of a mock modular form. In
this paper, we consider this problem with the Eichler cohomology theory,
especially the supplementary function theory developed by Knopp. Using
holomorphic Poincar\'e series and their supplementary functions, we construct a
pair of families of vector-valued harmonic weak Maass forms satisfying the
Zagier duality with integer weights $-k$ and $k+2$ respectively, $k>0$, for a
$H$-group. We also investigate the structures of them such as the images under
the differential operators $D^{k+1}$ and $\xi_{-k}$ and quadric relations of
the critical values of their $L$-functions.

there are numerical coincidences between the MOND acceleration parameter, the

magnetospheric radius ~3000 km and the mass-accretion rate ~ 10^{14} g/s. This
situation could be described in terms of accretion from a (residual) fossil
disk established from the material falling back towards the star after its
birth. However, current fall-back accretion scenarios encounter major
difficulties explaining an extremely long spin period of the young neutron
star. We show that the problems can be avoided if the accreting material is
magnetized. The star in this case is surrounded by a fossil magnetic slab in
which the material is confined by the magnetic field of the accretion flow
itself. We find that the surface magnetic field of the neutron star within this

above about 240 GV. Another essential feature is the difference between proton

the energy range from $10^{2}$ to $10^{4}$ GV. We consider the concavity of
particle spectrum resulting from the nonlinear nature of diffusive shock
acceleration in supernova remnants (SNR) as a possible reason for the observed
spectrum hardening. Helium-to-proton ratio increasing with energy can be
interpreted as a consequence of cosmic ray acceleration by forward and reverse
shocks in SNRs. The contribution of particles accelerated by reverse shocks
makes the concavity of the produced overall cosmic ray spectrum more
pronounced. The spectra of protons and helium nuclei accelerated in SNRs and
released into the interstellar medium are calculated. The derived steady state
interstellar spectra are in reasonably good agreement with observations.

careful description of the empirical hierarchy and positive values found in

LHC, we investigate how just the consistent solution of the scalar mass
hierarchy problem points towards the minimal necessary field content. We show
that to ameliorate the fine-tuning problem, one needs to introduce more scalar
degrees of freedom. The simplest solution is one or more real singlets (with
the possibility of combining two of them in a complex singlet), which may act
as viable cold dark matter candidates, because the constraints on the scalar
potential disfavor any mixing between the new scalar(s) with the SM doublet.
Furthermore, the fine-tuning problem of the new scalars necessitates the
introduction of vector-like fermions. Thus, singlet scalar(s) and vector
fermions are minimal enhancements over the Standard Model to alleviate the
fine-tuning problem. We also show that the model predicts Landau poles for all
the scalar couplings, whose positions depend only on the number of such
singlets. Thus, introduction of some new physics at that scale becomes
inevitable. We also discuss how the model confronts the LHC constraints and the
latest XENON100 data.

[FeII]1.644um and H_2 2.122um. While no correlations with sigma_star were found
for H_2 and [SIII], a good correlation was found for the two [Fe II] emission
lines, expressed by the linear fit sigma_star = 95.4\pm16.1 +
(0.25\pm0.08)sigma_[Fe II]. Excluding barred objects from the sample a better
correlation is found between sigma_star and sigma_[FeII], with a correlation
coefficient of R=0.80 and fitted by the following relation: sigma_\star =
57.9\pm23.5 + (0.42\pm0.10)sigma_[FeII]. This correlation can be used to
estimate $\sigma_\star$ in cases it cannot be directly measured and the [FeII]
emission lines are present in the spectra, allowing to obtain the mass of the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) from the M-\sigma_\star relation. The scatter
from a one-to-one relationship between sigma_star and its value derived from
sigma_[FeII] using the equation above for our sample is 0.07dex, which is
smaller than that obtained in previous studies which use \sigma_[OIII] in the
optical as a proxy for sigma_star. The use of sigma_[Fe\,II] in the near-IR

optical spectra are not available or are obscured, as is the case of many AGN.

time. A process for their backward evolution is referred to as a time reversed
process. It is often greatly helpful to view a stochastic model from two
different time directions. In particular, if some property is unchanged under
time reversal, we may better understand that property. A concept of
reversibility is invented for this invariance. Local balance for a stationary
Markov chain has been used for a weaker version of the reversibility. However,
it is still too strong for queueing applications.
  We are concerned with a continuous time Markov chain, but dose not assume it
has the stationary distribution. We define reversibility in structure as an
invariant property of a family of the set of models under certain operation.
The member of this set is a pair of transition rate function and its supporting
measure, and each set represents dynamics of queueing systems such as arrivals
and departures. We use a permutation {\Gamma} of the family menmbers, that is,
the sets themselves, to describe the change of the dynamics under time
reversal. This reversibility is is called {\Gamma}-reversibility in structure.
  To apply these definitions, we introduce new classes of models, called
reacting systems and self-reacting systems. Using those definitions and models,
we give a unified view for queues and their networks which have reversibility
in structure, and show how their stationary distributions can be obtained. They
include symmetric service, batch movements and state dependent routing.

lambda-calculus to prove that two lambda-terms are not beta-convertible.
Techniques employing the usual Boehm Trees are inadequate when we deal with
terms having the same Boehm Tree (BT). This is the case in particular for fixed
point combinators, as they all have the same BT. Another interesting equation,
whose consideration was suggested by Scott, is BY = BYS, an equation valid in
the classical model P-omega of lambda-calculus, and hence valid with respect to
BT-equality but nevertheless the terms are beta-inconvertible. To prove such
beta-inconvertibilities, we employ `clocked' BT's, with annotations that convey
information of the tempo in which the data in the BT are produced. Boehm Trees
are thus enriched with an intrinsic clock behaviour, leading to a refined
discrimination method for lambda-terms. The corresponding equality is strictly
intermediate between beta-convertibility and Boehm Tree equality, the equality
in the model P-omega. An analogous approach pertains to Levy-Longo and
Berarducci Trees. Our refined Boehm Trees find in particular an application in
beta-discriminating fixed point combinators (fpc's). It turns out that Scott's
equation BY = BYS is the key to unlocking a plethora of fpc's, generated by a
variety of production schemes of which the simplest was found by Boehm, stating
that new fpc's are obtained by postfixing the term SI, also known as Smullyan's
Owl. We prove that all these newly generated fpc's are indeed new, by
considering their clocked BT's. Even so, not all pairs of new fpc's can be
discriminated this way. For that purpose we increase the discrimination power
by a precision of the clock notion that we call `atomic clock'.

  The latency a user observes is a sum of communication delays and the time

analyze the problem of balancing the load in a network of servers in order to
minimize the total observed latency. We consider both cooperative and selfish
organizations (each organization aiming to minimize the latency of the
locally-produced requests). The problem can be generalized to the task
scheduling in a distributed cloud; or to content delivery in an
organizationally-distributed CDNs.
  In a cooperative network, we show that the problem is polynomially solvable.
We also present a distributed algorithm iteratively balancing the load. We show
how to estimate the distance between the current solution and the optimum based
on the amount of load exchanged by the algorithm. During the experimental
evaluation, we show that the distributed algorithm is efficient, therefore it
can be used in networks with dynamically changing loads.
  In a network of selfish organizations, we prove that the price of anarchy
(the worst-case loss of performance due to selfishness) is low when the network
is homogeneous and the servers are loaded (the request handling time is high
compared to the communication delay). After relaxing these assumptions, we
assess the loss of performance caused by the selfishness experimentally,
showing that it remains low.
  Our results indicate that a network of servers handling requests can be
efficiently managed by a distributed algorithm. Additionally, even if the
network is organizationally distributed, with individual organizations
optimizing performance of their requests, the network remains efficient.

Galerkin methods for fully nonlinear second order elliptic and parabolic
partial differential equations (PDEs) in the case of one spatial dimension. The
primary goal of the paper to develop a general framework for constructing high
order local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) methods for approximating viscosity
solutions of these fully nonlinear PDEs which are merely continuous functions
by definition. In order to capture discontinuities of the first order
derivative $u_x$ of the solution $u$, two independent functions $q_1$ and $q_2$
are introduced to approximate one-sided derivatives of $u$. Similarly, to
capture the discontinuities of the second order derivative $u_{xx}$, four
independent functions $p_{1}$, $p_{2}$, $p_{3}$, and $p_{4}$ are used to
approximate one-sided derivatives of $q_1$ and $q_2$. The proposed LDG
framework, which is based on a nonstandard mixed formulation of the underlying
PDE, embeds a given fully nonlinear problem into a mostly linear system of
equations where the given nonlinear differential operator must be replaced by a
numerical operator which allows multiple value inputs of the first and second
order derivatives $u_x$ and $u_{xx}$. An easy to verify criterion for
constructing ""good"" numerical operators is also proposed. It consists of a
consistency and a generalized monotonicity. To ensure such a generalized
monotonicity, the crux of the construction is to introduce the numerical moment
in the numerical operator. The proposed framework extends a companion finite
difference framework developed by the authors in [9] and allows for the
approximation of fully nonlinear PDEs using high order polynomials and
non-uniform meshes.

functioned as heat engine (thermosynthesis) while thermally cycled in
convecting volcanic hot springs. Here I argue for a role of thermal gradients
above submarine hydrothermal vents (SHV) in several major transitions. The last
decade has witnessed the emergence of phononics, a novel discipline in physics
based on controlled heat transport in thermal gradients. It builds thermal
analogs to electronic devices: the thermal diode, the thermal transistor, the
thermal switch, the thermal amplifier, the thermal memory--the thermal computer
has been proposed. Encouraged by (1) the many similarities between microtubules
(MT) and carbon nanotubes, which have a very high thermal conductivity, and (2)
the recent discovery of a silk protein which also has a very high thermal
conductivity, I combine and extend the mentioned ideas, and propose the general
conjecture that several major transitions of evolution were effected by thermal
processes, with four additional partial conjectures: (1) The first organisms
used heat engines during thermosynthesis in convection cells; (2) The first
eukaryotic cells used MT during thermosynthesis in the thermal gradient above
SHV; (3) The first metazoans used transport of water or in water during
thermosynthesis above SHV under an ice-covered ocean during the Gaskiers
Snowball Earth; and (4) The first mammalian brain used a thermal machinery
based on thermal gradients in or across the cortex. When experimentally proven
these conjectures, which are testable by the methods of synthetic biology,
would significantly enhance our understanding of life.
