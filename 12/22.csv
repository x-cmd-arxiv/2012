Question 1 (p. 15) added",,,,"math.AG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sometimes it is possible to extend some using Newton polyhedra computations
in algebraic geometry from polynomials to exponential sums. For this purpose it
is useful to consider analogues of tropical varieties in complex space. These
analogues are called exponential tropical varieties (ETV). We construct the
ring of ETV. Algebraic tropical varieties form the subring of the ring of ETV.
In this paper we connect ETV with the complex Monge-Ampere operator action on
the space of piecewise linear functions in complex vector space. We show that
all ETV arise as results of such operator action. We give some applications of
this connection. One of the applications is a criterion for zero value of a
mixed Monge-Ampere operator. This criterion is the modification of the
criterion for zero value of a mixed volume of convex bodies. The proof is the
modification of A. Khovanskii's unpublished proof of the corresponding theorem
on mixed volumes. In the part 1 we give the definition of ETV and detail
statements of theorems (without proofs). In the part 2 we prove the theorems on
the action of the Monge-Ampere operator.

interacting components. At each time unit, each component can take two values,
indicating if it has a spike or not at this precise moment. The system evolves
as follows. For each component, the probability of having a spike at the next
time unit depends on the entire time evolution of the system after the last
spike time of the component. This class of systems extends in a non trivial way
both the interacting particle systems, which are Markovian, and the stochastic
chains with memory of variable length which have finite state space. These
features make it suitable to describe the time evolution of biological neural
systems. We construct a stationary version of the process by using a
probabilistic tool which is a Kalikow-type decomposition either in random
environment or in space-time. This construction implies uniqueness of the
stationary process. Finally we consider the case where the interactions between
components are given by a critical directed Erd\""os-R\'enyi-type random graph
with a large but finite number of components. In this framework we obtain an
explicit upper-bound for the correlation between successive inter-spike
intervals which is compatible with previous empirical findings.

graphene. Two bands of reflectivity minima are found, one at 0 - 8 eV and the
other at 14 - 22 eV above the vacuum level. For a free-standing slab with n
layers of graphene, each band contains n-1 zeroes in the reflectivity. Two
additional image-potential type states form at the ends of the graphene slab,
with energies just below the vacuum level, hence producing a total of 2n
states. A tight-binding model is developed, with basis functions localized in
the spaces between the graphene planes (and at the ends of the slab). The

perturbations. Several experimental and clinical findings have highlighted the
association between gait LDS and fall risk. Walking without shoes is known to
slightly modify gait parameters. Barefoot walking (BW) may cause unusual
sensory feedback to individuals accustomed to shod walking (SW), and this may
impact on LDS. The objective of this study was therefore to compare the LDS of
SW and BW in healthy individuals and to analyze the intrasession repeatability.
Forty participants traversed a 70 m indoor corridor wearing normal shoes in one
trial and walking barefoot in a second trial. Trunk accelerations were recorded
with a 3D-accelerometer attached to the lower back. The LDS was computed using
the finite-time maximal Lyapunov exponent method. Absolute agreement between
the forward and backward paths was estimated with the intraclass correlation
coefficient (ICC). BW did not significantly modify the LDS as compared to SW
(average standardized effect size: +0.12). The intrasession repeatability was
high in SW (ICC: 0.73-0.79) and slightly higher in BW (ICC: 0.82-0.88).
Therefore, it seems that BW can be used to evaluate LDS without introducing
bias as compared to SW, and with a sufficient reliability.

compute a grid of 12 initial stellar masses and 176 models per stellar mass to
explore the effects of independently varying the 12^C(a,g)16^O and 3a reaction
rates, denoted R_a12 and R_3a, respectively. The production factors of both the
intermediate-mass elements (A=16-40) and the s-only isotopes along the weak
s-process path (70Ge, 76Se, 80Kr, 82Kr, 86Sr, and 87Sr) were found to be in
reasonable agreement with predictions for variations of R_3a and R_a12 of
+/-25%; the s-only isotopes, however, tend to favor higher values of R_3a than
the intermediate-mass isotopes. The experimental uncertainty (one standard
deviation) in R_3a(R_a12) is approximately +/-10%(+/-25%). The results show
that a more accurate measurement of one of these rates would decrease the
uncertainty in the other as inferred from the present calculations. We also
observe sharp changes in production factors and standard deviations for small
changes in the reaction rates, due to differences in the convection structure
of the star. The compactness parameter was used to assess which models would
likely explode as successful supernovae, and hence contribute explosive
nucleosynthesis yields. We also provide the approximate remnant masses for each

translational invariance along the fifth dimension, c) it is possible to
construct renormalized trajectories on the phase diagram along which the Higgs

the transient case, we obtain formally that the optimal variance scales very
differently in $n$ depending on the sign of a moment of the distribution, which

intuitive way of achieving stabilization by rendering a system passive with
respect to a desired storage function. However, in most instances the control
law is obtained without any performance considerations and it has to be
calculated by solving a complex partial differential equation (PDE). In order
to address these issues we introduce a reinforcement learning approach into the
energy-balancing passivity-based control (EB-PBC) method, which is a form of
PBC in which the closed-loop energy is equal to the difference between the
stored and supplied energies. We propose a technique to parameterize EB-PBC
that preserves the systems's PDE matching conditions, does not require the
specification of a global desired Hamiltonian, includes performance criteria,
and is robust to extra non-linearities such as control input saturation. The
parameters of the control law are found using actor-critic reinforcement
learning, enabling learning near-optimal control policies satisfying a desired
closed-loop energy landscape. The advantages are that near-optimal controllers
can be generated using standard energy shaping techniques and that the
solutions learned can be interpreted in terms of energy shaping and damping
injection, which makes it possible to numerically assess stability using
passivity theory. From the reinforcement learning perspective, our proposal
allows for the class of port-Hamiltonian systems to be incorporated in the
actor-critic framework, speeding up the learning thanks to the resulting
parameterization of the policy. The method has been successfully applied to the
pendulum swing-up problem in simulations and real-life experiments.

the system matrix represents the total cycle time, whereas the max-plus
eigenvector dictates the steady-state behavior. Uniqueness of the
eigenstructure also indicates uniqueness of the resulting behavior. For the
particular case of legged locomotion, the movement of each leg is abstracted to
two-state circuits: swing and stance (leg in flight and on the ground,
respectively). The generation of a gait (a manner of walking) for a multiple
legged robot is then achieved by synchronizing the multiple discrete-event
cycles via the max-plus framework. By construction, different gaits and gait
parameters can be safely interleaved by using different system matrices. In
this paper we address both the transient and steady-state behavior for a class
of gaits by presenting closed-form expressions for the max-plus eigenvalue and
max-plus eigenvector of the system matrix and the coupling time. The
significance of this result is in showing guaranteed robustness to
perturbations and gait switching, and also a systematic methodology for
synthesizing controllers that allow for legged robots to change rhythms fast.

plasma energetics of an eruptive plasmoid and occulted flare observed by Solar
Dynamics Observatory/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA). We study an event
from 03-Nov-2010 (peaking at 12:20UT in GOES soft X-rays) of a coronal mass
ejection and occulted flare which demonstrates the morphology of a classic
erupting flux rope. The high spatial, and time resolution, and six coronal
channels, of the SDO/AIA images allows the dynamics of the multi-thermal
emission during the initial phases of eruption to be studied in detail. The
Differential Emission Measure (DEM) is calculated, using an optimised version
of a regularized inversion method (Hannah & Kontar 2012), for each pixel across
the six channels at different times, resulting in emission measure maps and
movies in a variety of temperature ranges. We find that the core of the
erupting plasmoid is hot (8-11, 11-14MK) with a similarly hot filamentary
""stem"" structure connecting it to the lower atmosphere, which could be
interpreted as the current sheet in the flux rope model, though is wider than
these models suggest. The velocity of the leading edge of the eruption is
597-664 km s$^{-1}$ in the temperature range $\ge$3-4MK and between 1029-1246
km s$^{-1}$ for $\le$2-3MK. We estimate the density (in 11-14 MK) of the
erupting core and stem during the impulsive phase to be about $3\times10^9$
cm$^{-3}$, $6\times10^9$ cm$^{-3}$, $9\times10^8$ cm$^{-3}$ in the plasmoid
core, stem and surrounding envelope of material. This gives thermal energy
estimates of $5\times10^{29}$ erg, $1\times10^{29}$ erg and $2\times10^{30}$
erg. The kinetic energy for the core and envelope is slightly smaller. The
thermal energy of the core and current sheet grows during the eruption,
suggesting continuous influx of energy presumably via reconnection.

comparing their result to the familiar determinantal expressions for
$n$-correlation that arise naturally in random matrix theory. In this paper we
deal with arbitrary support and show that there is another expression for the

extinct, and a coexisting one, in which concentrations of all species are
non-zero. There are two possible ways for the system to reach the absorbing
state. In some cases the densities increase very quickly at the beginning of a
simulation and then decline slowly and almost monotonically. In others, well
pronounced peaks in the $R$, $C$ and $D$ densities appear regularly before the
extinction. Those peaks correspond to density outbursts (waves) traveling
through the system. We investigate the mechanisms leading to the waves. In
particular, we show that the percolation of the detritus (i. e. the
accumulation of nutrients) is necessary for the emergence of the waves.
Moreover, our results corroborate the hypothesis that top-level predators play
an essential role in maintaining the stability of a food web (top-down

observed near Earth. It triggered one of the most intense geomagnetic storms of
solar cycle 23 (Dst peak = -263 nT). This structure has been associated with
the two-ribbon flare, filament eruption, and coronal mass ejection originating
in active region 10759 (NOAA number). We analyze here the sequence of events,
from solar wind measurements (at 1 AU) and back to the Sun, to understand the
origin and evolution of this geoeffective ICME. From a detailed observational
study of in situ magnetic field observations and plasma parameters in the
interplanetary (IP) medium and the use of appropriate models we propose an
alternative interpretation of the IP observations, different to those discussed
in previous studies. In our view, the IP structure is formed by two extremely
close consecutive magnetic clouds (MCs) that preserve their identity during
their propagation through the interplanetary medium. Consequently, we identify
two solar events in H{\alpha} and EUV which occurred in the source region of
the MCs. The timing between solar and IP events, as well as the orientation of
the MC axes and their associated solar arcades are in good agreement.
Additionally, interplanetary radio type II observations allow the tracking of
the multiple structures through inner heliosphere and pin down the interaction
region to be located midway between the Sun and the Earth. The chain of
observations from the photosphere to interplanetary space is in agreement with
this scenario. Our analysis allows the detection of the solar sources of the
transients and explains the extremely fast changes of the solar wind due to the
transport of two attached (though nonmerging) MCs which affect the
magnetosphere.

probability $T_2$ that an adopter directly causes a susceptible node to adopt
the fad. We formulate a tree approximation for the MIC model on an uncorrelated
network with an arbitrary degree distribution $p_k$. Applied on a random
regular network with degree $k=6$, this model exhibits a rich phase diagram,
including continuous and discontinuous transition lines for fad percolation,
and a continuous transition line for the percolation of susceptible nodes. In
particular, the percolation transition of fads is discontinuous (continuous)
when $T_1$ is larger (smaller) than a certain value. A similar discontinuous
transition is also observed in random graphs and scale-free networks.
Furthermore, assigning a finite fraction of initial adopters dramatically
changes the phase boundaries.

Current approaches for representing waveform information are based on

carrying a few percent of the total power output near merger can supply
information critical to determining intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the
binary. One obstacle to constructing a full multi-mode template of merger

instead of settling down to a simple quasinormal frequency with decaying
amplitude, some $|m| \neq \ell$ modes show periodic bumps characteristic of
mode-mixing. We analyze the strongest of these modes -- the anomalous $(3,2)$
harmonic mode -- measured in a set of binary black-hole merger waveform
simulations, and show that to leading order, they are due to a mismatch between
the spherical harmonic basis used for extraction in 3D numerical relativity
simulations, and the spheroidal harmonics adapted to the perturbation theory of
Kerr black holes. Other causes of mode-mixing arising from gauge ambiguities
and physical properties of the quasinormal ringdown modes are also considered

sensor networks (WSNs) through minimizing long range communication and energy
balancing. Sensor nodes are resource constrained particularly with limited
energy that is difficult or impossible to replenish. LEACH (Low Energy Adaptive
Clustering Hierarchy) is most well-known cluster based architecture for WSN
that aims to evenly dissipate energy among all sensor nodes. In cluster based
architecture, the role of cluster head is very crucial for the successful
operation of WSN because once the cluster head becomes non functional, the
whole cluster becomes dysfunctional. We have proposed a modified cluster based
WSN architecture by introducing a coordinator node (CN) that is rich in terms
of resources. This CN take up the responsibility of transmitting data to the
base station over longer distances from cluster heads. We have proposed a
cluster head selection algorithm based on K-theorem and other parameters i.e.
residual energy, distance to coordinator node, reliability and degree of
mobility. The K-theorem is used to select candidate cluster heads based on
bunch of sensor nodes in a cluster. We believe that the proposed architecture
and algorithm achieves higher energy efficiency through minimizing
communication and energy balancing. The proposed architecture is more scalable

mobility.

of the dipolar Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), trapped in a dual-core system

realizations of such a matter-wave coupler are introduced, weakly- and

while the latter one is represented by a single pipe sliced by an external
field into parallel layers. The dipoles are oriented along axes of the pipes.
In these systems, the dual-core solitons feature the SSB of the supercritical

symmetric and asymmetric solitons, and, in addition, for non-bifurcating
antisymmetric ones, as well as for symmetric flat states, which may also be
stable in the strongly-coupled system, due to competition between the
attractive and repulsive intra- and inter-core DDIs. Effects of the contact
interactions are considered too. Collisions between moving asymmetric solitons
in the weakly-symmetric system feature elastic rebound, merger into a single
breather, and passage accompanied by excitation of intrinsic vibrations of the
solitons, for small, intermediate, and large collision velocities,
respectively. A PT-symmetric version of the weakly-coupled system is briefly
considered too, which may be relevant for matter-wave lasers. Stability
boundaries for PT-symmetric and antisymmetric solitons are identified.

of the signal itself to be recovered to guarantee almost error-free recovery,
for sufficiently large dimension. To arrive at the results, we employ a duality
between noiseless CS and analog coding across sparse additive noisy channel
(SANC). Extending Renyi Information Dimension to Mutual Information Dimension
(MID), we show the operational meaning of MID to be the fundamental limit of
asymptotically error-free analog transmission across SANC under linear analog
encoding constraint. We prove that MID polarizes after analog polar
transformation and obeys the same recursive relationship as BEC. We further
prove that analog polar encoding can achieve the fundamental limit of
achievable dimension rate with vanishing Pe across SANC. From the duality, a
structured construction scheme is proposed for the linear measurement matrix
which achieves the minimum measurement requirement for noiseless CS.

four-dimensional theories and a remarkable mathematical structure known as the
positive Grassmannian. The central physical idea is to focus on on-shell
diagrams as objects of fundamental importance to scattering amplitudes. We show
that the all-loop integrand in N=4 SYM is naturally represented in this way.
On-shell diagrams in this theory are intimately tied to a variety of
mathematical objects, ranging from a new graphical representation of
permutations to a beautiful stratification of the Grassmannian G(k,n) which
generalizes the notion of a simplex in projective space. All physically
important operations involving on-shell diagrams map to canonical operations on
permutations; in particular, BCFW deformations correspond to adjacent
transpositions. Each cell of the positive Grassmannian is naturally endowed
with positive coordinates and an invariant measure which determines the
on-shell function associated with the diagram. This understanding allows us to
classify and compute all on-shell diagrams, and give a geometric understanding
for all the non-trivial relations among them. Yangian invariance of scattering
amplitudes is transparently represented by diffeomorphisms of G(k,n) which
preserve the positive structure. Scattering amplitudes in (1+1)-dimensional
integrable systems and the ABJM theory in (2+1) dimensions can both be
understood as special cases of these ideas. On-shell diagrams in theories with
less (or no) supersymmetry are associated with exactly the same structures in
the Grassmannian, but with a measure deformed by a factor encoding ultraviolet
singularities. The Grassmannian representation of on-shell processes also gives
a new understanding of the all-loop integrand for scattering amplitudes,
presenting all integrands in a novel dLog form which directly reflects the
underlying positive structure.

includes an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent God who experiences great
value in creating and knowing a universe with great mathematical elegance, even

  God seems loathe to violate elegant laws of physics that He has chosen to use
in His creation, such as Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism or Einstein's
equations of general relativity for gravity within their classical domains of
applicability, even if their violation could greatly reduce human suffering
(e.g., from falls). If indeed God is similarly loathe to violate quantum
unitarity (though such violations by judicious collapses of the wavefunction
could greatly reduce human suffering by always choosing only favorable
outcomes), the resulting unitary evolution would lead to an Everett multiverse
of `many worlds', meaning many different quasiclassical histories beyond the
quasiclassical history that each of us can observe over his or her lifetime.
This is a theological argument for one reason why God might prefer to create a
multiverse much broader than what one normally thinks of for a history of the

it difficult to track down the photospheric origin of each coronal dissipation
event, especially in the presence of complex magnetic topologies. In this
paper, we propose an ensemble-based approach for testing the photosphere -
corona coupling in a quiet solar region as represented by intermittent activity
in SOHO MDI and STEREO EUVI image sets. For properly adjusted detection
thresholds corresponding to the same degree of intermittency in the photosphere

different geometric properties. We derive a set of scaling relations
reconciling the two groups of results and enabling statistical description of
coronal dynamics based on photospheric observations. Our analysis suggests that
multiscale intermittent dissipation in the corona at spatial scales > 3 Mm is
controlled by turbulent photospheric convection. Complex topology of the
photospheric network makes this coupling essentially nonlocal and
non-deterministic. Our results are in an agreement with the Parker's coupling
scenario in which random photospheric shuffling generates marginally stable
magnetic discontinuities at the coronal level, but they are also consistent
with an impulsive wave heating involving multiscale Alfvenic wave packets

sections of the magnetic wreaths in which turbulent flows amplify the fields to
much larger values than is possible through laminar processes. These amplified

buoyancy and advection by convective giant cells, forming buoyant loops. We
measure statistical trends in the polarity, twist, and tilt of these loops.

information processing in vertebrate and invertebrate brains. The insect
antennal lobe represents a spatially confined local network that processes
high-dimensional and redundant peripheral input to compute an efficient odor
code. Social insects can rely on a particularly rich olfactory receptor
repertoire and they exhibit complex odor-guided behaviors. This corresponds
with a high anatomical complexity of their AL network. In the honeybee, a large
number of glomeruli that receive sensory input are interconnected by a dense
network of local interneurons (LNs). Uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs)
integrate sensory and recurrent network input into an efficient spatio-temporal
odor code. To investigate the specific computational roles of LNs and PNs we
measured eleven features of sub- and suprathreshold single cell responses to in
vivo odor stimulation. Using a semi-supervised cluster analysis we identified a
combination of five characteristic features that enabled the accurate
separation of morphologically identified LNs and PNs. The two clusters differed
significantly in all five features. In the absence of stimulation PNs showed a
higher subthreshold activation, assumed higher peak response rates and more
regular spiking pattern. LNs reacted considerably faster to the onset of a
stimulus and their responses were more reliable across stimulus repetitions. We
discuss possible mechanisms that can explain our results, and we interpret
cell-type specific characteristics with respect to their functional relevance.

  Power Grid Networks",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, there has been a growing concern about the overload status of the
power grid networks, and the increasing possibility of cascading failures. Many
researchers have studied these networks to provide design guidelines for more
robust power grids. Topological analysis is one of the components of system
analysis for its robustness. This paper presents a complex systems analysis of
power grid networks. First, the cascading effect has been simulated on three
well known networks: the IEEE 300 bus test system, the IEEE 118 bus test
system, and the WSCC 179 bus equivalent model. To extend the analysis to a
larger set of networks, we develop a network generator and generate multiple
graphs with characteristics similar to the IEEE test networks but with
different topologies. The generated graphs are then compared to the test
networks to show the effect of topology in determining their robustness with
respect to cascading failures. The generated graphs turn out to be more robust
than the test graphs, showing the importance of topology in the robust design
of power grids. The second part of this paper concerns the discussion of two
novel mitigation strategies for cascading failures: Targeted Load Reduction and
Islanding using Distributed Sources. These new mitigation strategies are
compared with the Homogeneous Load Reduction strategy. Even though the
Homogeneous Load Reduction is simpler to implement, the Targeted Load Reduction
is much more effective. Additionally, an algorithm is presented for the
partitioning of the network for islanding as an effort towards fault isolation
to prevent cascading failures. The results for island formation are better if
the sources are well distributed, else the algorithm leads to the formation of
superislands.

establish validity of the Bayesian bootstrap. The paper nests as special cases
the canonical examples in the literature: mean regression with interval valued

an index, the paper covers problems beyond mean regression; the framework is
extremely versatile. Applications include quantile and distribution regression

mass ejections(CMEs). However, spectro-polarimetric measurements of certain
photospheric lines permit a determination of the vector magnetic field at the
photosphere. Thus, substantial collection of magnetograms relate to the
photospheric surface field only. Numerical modeling is carried out by applying
state-of-the-art nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) reconstruction. Cartesian
nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) codes are not well suited for larger
domains, since the spherical nature of the solar surface cannot be neglected
when the field of view is large. One of the most significant results of Solar
Dynamic Observatory (SDO) mission to date has been repeated observations of
large, almost global scale events in which large scale connection between
active regions may play fundamental role. Therefore, it appears prudent to
implement a NLFFF procedure in spherical geometry for use when large scale
boundary data are available, such as from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager
(HMI) on board SDO. In this work, we model the coronal magnetic field above
multiple active regions with the help of a potential field and a NLFFF
extrapolation codes in a full-disk using HMI data as a boundary conditions. We
compare projections of the resulting magnetic field lines solutions with
full-disk coronal images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) for
both models. This study has found that the NLFFF model reconstructs the
magnetic configuration better than the potential field model. We have concluded
that much of trans-equatorial loops connecting the two solar hemispheres are

stellar disk that surrounds it. We report here the discovery of an eccentric
Halpha emitting disk around the black hole at the center of M31 and show how
modeling this disk can provide an independent determination of the mass of the
black hole. Our model implies a mass of 5.0_{-1.0}^{+0.8} x 10^7 Mo for the
central black hole, consistent with the average of determinations by methods
involving stellar dynamics, and compatible (at 1-sigma level) with measurements
obtained from the most detailed models of the stellar disk around the central
black hole. This value is also consistent with the M-sigma relation. In order
to make a comparison, we applied our simulation on the stellar kinematics in
the nucleus of M31 and concluded that the parameters obtained for the stellar
disk are not formally compatible with the parameters obtained for the Halpha
emitting disk. This result suggests that the stellar and the Halpha emitting
disks are intrinsically different from each other. A plausible explanation is
that the Halpha emission is associated with a gaseous disk. This hypothesis is
supported by the detection of traces of weaker nebular lines in the nuclear
region of M31. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the Halpha
emission is, at least partially, generated by stars.

optical low-ionization emission lines, and has a surprisingly high excitation
temperature. Here we study Knot 51, a representative, bright example, for which
we have available long slit optical and NIR spectra covering emission lines
from ionized, neutral, and molecular gas, as well as HST visible and SOAR

probe the excitation mechanisms, formation processes and dust content in
environments that can produce the observed H2 emission. We do not try for an
exact match between model and observations given Knot 51's ambiguous geometry.
Rather, we aim to explain how the bright H2 emission lines can be formed from
within the volume of Knot 51 that also produces the observed optical emission
from ionized and neutral gas. Our models that are powered only by the Crab's
synchrotron radiation are ruled out because they cannot reproduce the strong,
thermal H2 emission. The simulations that come closest to fitting the
observations have the core of Knot 51 almost entirely atomic with the H2
emission coming from just a trace molecular component, and in which there is
extra heating. In this unusual environment, H2 forms primarily by associative
detachment rather than grain catalysis. In this picture, the 55 H2-emitting
cores that we have previously catalogued in the Crab have a total mass of about
0.1 M_sun, which is about 5% of the total mass of the system of filaments. We
also explore the effect of varying the dust abundance. We discuss possible
future observations that could further elucidate the nature of these H2 knots.

In contrast, it is much easier to obtain physically very precise straight lines
by tightly stretching good quality strings on a frame. Taking literally
""plumb-line methods"", we built a ""calibration harp"" instead of the classic flat
patterns to obtain a high precision measurement tool, demonstrably reaching
2/100 pixel precisions. The harp is complemented with the algorithms computing
automatically from harp photographs two different and complementary lens
distortion measurements. The precision of the method is evaluated on images
corrected by state-of-the-art distortion correction algorithms, and by popular
software. Three applications are shown: first an objective and reliable
measurement of the result of any distortion correction. Second, the harp
permits to control state-of-the art global camera calibration algorithms: It
permits to select the right distortion model, thus avoiding internal
compensation errors inherent to these methods. Third, the method replaces
manual procedures in other distortion correction methods, makes them fully
automatic, and increases their reliability and precision.

In linear case, by using residue theorem and a spectrum decomposition method,
we prove that there exists a crossover from electromagnetically induced
transparency (EIT) to Autler-Townes splitting (ATS) for co-propagating
configuration of probe and control fields. However, there is no EIT and hence
no EIT-ATS crossover for counter-propagating configuration. We give various
explicit formulas, including probe-field spectrum decomposition, EIT condition,
width of EIT transparency window, as well as a comparison with the result of
cold molecules. Our analytical result agrees well with the experimental one
reported recently by A. Lazoudis et al. [Phys. Rev.A82, 023812 (2010)]. In
nonlinear case, by using the method of multiple-scales, we derive a nonlinear
envelope equation for probe-field propagation. We show that stable ultraslow

simply-typed syntax with variable binding and equipped with reduction rules via
a universal property, namely as the initial object of some category of models.
For this purpose, we employ techniques developed in two previous works: in the
first work we model syntactic translations between languages over different
sets of types as initial morphisms in a category of models. In the second work
we characterize untyped syntax with reduction rules as initial object in a
category of models. In the present work, we combine the techniques used earlier
in order to characterize simply-typed syntax with reduction rules as initial
object in a category. The universal property yields an operator which allows to
specify translations---that are semantically faithful by construction---between
languages over possibly different sets of types.
  As an example, we upgrade a translation from PCF to the untyped lambda
calculus, given in previous work, to account for reduction in the source and
target. Specifically, we specify a reduction semantics in the source and target
language through suitable rules. By equipping the untyped lambda calculus with
the structure of a model of PCF, initiality yields a translation from PCF to
the lambda calculus, that is faithful with respect to the reduction semantics
specified by the rules.

tend to propagate together as bound objects is favored, while for strong
coupling a better description is obtained by having deconfined Majorana
fermions. This way of looking at the Kondo lattice offers an alternative
phenomenological description of this model. In the second part of the paper we
provide a detailed derivation of the discretized path integral formulation of
any Majorana fermion theory. This general formulation will be useful as a
starting point for further studies, such as Quantum Monte Carlo, perturbative
expansions, and Renormalization Group analysis. As an example we use this path
integral formalism to formulate a finite temperature variational calculation,

of the water masers towards VLA 3-N. The water maser emission toward the region
VLA 3-N shows two bow shock-like structures, Northern and Southern, separated
from each other by ~ 100 mas (~ 330 AU). The spatial distribution and
kinematics of the water masers in this cluster have persisted over a time span
of seven years. The Northern bow shock has a somewhat irregular morphology,
while the Southern one has a remarkably smooth morphology. We measured the
proper motions of 33 water maser features, which have an average proper motion
velocity of ~ 1.3 mas/yr (~ 20 km/s). The morphology and the proper motions of
this cluster of water masers show systematic expanding motions that could imply
one or two different centers of star formation activity. We made a detailed
model for the Southern structure, proposing two different kinematic models to
explain the 3-dimensional spatio-kinematical distribution of the water masers:
(1) a static central source driving the two bow-shock structures; (2) two
independent driving sources, one of them exciting the Northern bow-shock
structure, and the other one, a young runaway star moving in the local
molecular medium exciting and molding the remarkably smoother Southern
bow-shock structure. Future observations will be necessary to discriminate
between the two scenarios, in particular by identifying the still unseen
driving source(s).

found that the initial correlations between two environments can turn a
Markovian to a non-Markovian regime with the extra control on the local
interaction time. We further research the nonlocal non-Markovian effects from
two situations: without extra control, the nonlocal non-Markovian effects only
appear under the condition that two local dynamics are
non-Markovian-non-Markovian(both of two local dynamics are non-Markovian), or
Markovian-non-Markovian, never appear under the condition of
Markovian-Markovian; with extra control, the nonlocal non-Markovian effects can
occur under the condition of Markovian-Markovian. It shows that the
correlations between two environments has an upper bound: only making a flow of
information from the environment back to the global system begin finitely
earlier than that back to any one of two local systems, not infinitely. Then,
due to observing that the classical correlations between two environments have
the same function as the quantum correlations, we advise two special ways to
distribute classical correlations between two environments without initial
correlations. Finally, from numerical solutions in the spin star configuration
we obtain that the self-correlation(internal correlation) of each environment
promotes the nonlocal non-Markovian effects.

classical estimation theory, and we show how they can be defined in a very
similar manner within quantum measurement theory. We show that the stochastic
master equations describing the dynamics of a quantum system subject to a
definite set of measurements provides likelihood functions for unknown
parameters in the system dynamics, and we show that the estimation error, given
by the Fisher information, can be identified by stochastic master equation
simulations. For large parameter spaces we describe and illustrate the
efficient use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling of the likelihood function.

called ADADELTA. The method dynamically adapts over time using only first order
information and has minimal computational overhead beyond vanilla stochastic
gradient descent. The method requires no manual tuning of a learning rate and
appears robust to noisy gradient information, different model architecture
choices, various data modalities and selection of hyperparameters. We show
promising results compared to other methods on the MNIST digit classification
task using a single machine and on a large scale voice dataset in a distributed

spatial periodicity ""R"", Bloch character is encoded in a wavevector ""K"". One
can ask whether this state has partial Bloch character ""k"" corresponding to a
finer scale of periodicity ""r"". Answering this is called ""unfolding."" A theorem
is proven that yields a mathematically clear prescription for unfolding, by
examining translational properties of the state, requiring no ""reference
states"" or basis functions with the finer periodicity (r,k). A question then
arises, how should one assign partial Bloch character to a state of a finite
system? A slab, finite in one direction, is used as the example. Perpendicular
components k_z of the wavevector are not explicitly defined, but may be hidden
in the state (and eigenvector |i>.) A prescription for extracting k_z is
offered and tested. An idealized silicon (111) surface is used as the example.
Slab-unfolding reveals surface-localized states and resonances which were not
evident from dispersion curves alone.

and low energy cooling in french tropical island buildings. Electric load
profiles of tropical islands in developed countries are characterised by
morning, midday and evening peaks arising from all year round high power demand
in the commercial and residential sectors, mostly due to air conditioning
appliances and bad thermal conception of the building. In early 1995, a DSM
pilot initiative has been launched in the french islands of Guadeloupe and
Reunion through a partnership between the French Public Utility EDF,
institutions involved in energy conservation, environment preservation (ADEME)
and construction quality improvment, the University of Reunion Island and
several other public and private partners (low cost housing institutions,
architects, energy consultant, etc...) to set up a standard in the thermal
conception of buildings in tropical climates. This has led to definition of
optimized bioclimatic urban planning and architectural design, the use of
passive cooling architectural components, natural ventilation and energy
efficient systems. The impact of each technical solution on the thermal comfort
within the building was evaluated with an airflow and thermal building
simulation software (CODYRUN). These technical solutions have been edited in a
pedagogical reference document and have been implemented in 300 new pilot
dwelling projects through the year 1996 in Reunion Island and in Guadeloupe
island. An experimental follow up is still in process in the first ECODOM
dwellings for an experimental validation of the impact of the passive cooling
solutions on the comfort of the occupants and to modify them if necessary.

theoretically and experimentally, using zero-dimensional electromagnetic
resonators coupled with an electronic transition between two confined states of
a semiconductor quantum well. We have measured a splitting between the coupled
modes that amounts to 48% of the energy transition, the highest ratio ever
observed in a light-matter coupled system. Our analysis, based on a microscopic
quantum theory, shows that the nonlinear polariton splitting, a signature of
this regime, is a dynamical effect arising from the self-interaction of the
collective electronic polarization with its own emitted field.

combined with numerical simulations on ordinary differential equations (ODEs),
we find two categories (pulses and snakes) of dissipative solitons, and analyze
the dependence of both their shape and stability on the physical parameters of
the cubic-quintic Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE). In contrast to the regular
solitary waves investigated in numerous integrable and non-integrable systems
over the last three decades, these dissipative solitons are not stationary in
time. Rather, they are spatially confined pulse-type structures whose envelopes
exhibit complicated temporal dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal very
interesting bifurcations sequences as the parameters of the CGLE are varied.
Our predictions on the variation of the soliton amplitude, width, position,
speed and phase of the solutions using the variational formulation agree with
simulation results.

  removed",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Tunguska explosion occurred in the morning of June 30, 1908, in Central
Siberia, some 800 km NNW from Lake Baikal. It devastated the forested area of
2150 sq. km, flattening and scorching some 30 million trees. Before this, a
luminous body flew overhead in the cloudless sky. The air waves from the
explosion were recorded as far as in London. The object that flew that morning
over Siberia is usually designated the ""Tunguska meteorite"" or - more
cautiously - the ""Tunguska space body"" (TSB). Certainly, this body was
dangerous: the taiga was leveled over an area twice as large as New York City.
The whole number of Tunguska hypotheses reaches a hundred, or so. But few of
them have been built according to the standards of science and with due
consideration of empirical data. There is also a serious methodological problem
that is, as a rule, overlooked: the need to take into consideration all
empirical data and to reconstruct the Tunguska event before building any models
of it. Such a reconstruction is essential - since the consequences of this
event are many and varied. The main Tunguska traces may be grouped and listed
as follows: (a) material traces; (b) instrumental traces; (c) informational
traces. To be sure that a proposed theory is correct, the scientist must check
it against all the three types of Tunguska evidence. Having reconstructed the
Tunguska event with due attention to all the evidence, we have to conclude that
it could not have been an asteroid or a comet core. There seems to exist in
space another type of dangerous space objects, whose nature still remains
unknown.
