  the origin of pairing in nuclei","61 pages, 27 figures, submitted to PRC",,,,"nucl-th nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent data resulting from studies of two-nucleon transfer reaction on 11Li,
analyzed through a unified nuclear-structure-direct-reaction theory have
provided strong direct as well as indirect confirmation, through the population
of the first excited state of 9Li and of the observation of a strongly quenched
ground state transition, of the prediction that phonon mediated pairing
interaction is the main mechanism binding the neutron halo of the 8.5 ms-lived
11Li nucleus. In other words, the ground state of 11Li can be viewed as a
neutron Cooper pair bound to the 9Li core, mainly through the exchange of
collective vibration of the core and of the pigmy resonance arizing from the
sloshing back and forth of the neutron halo against the protons of the core,
the mean field leading to unbound two particle states, a situation essentially
not altered by the bare nucleon-nucleon interaction acting between the halo
neutrons. Two-neutron pick-up data, together with (t,p) data on 7Li, suggest
the existence of a pairing vibrational band based on 9Li, whose members can be
excited with the help of inverse kinematic experiments as was done in the case
of 11Li(p,t)9Li reaction. The deviation from harmonicity can provide insight
into the workings of medium polarization effects on Cooper pair nuclear
pairing, let alone specific information concering the ""rigidity"" of the N=6
shell closure. Further information concerning these questions is provided by
the predicted absolute differential cross sections associated with the
reactions 12Be(p,t)10Be(gs) and 12Be(p,t)10Be(pv)(~10Be(p,t)8Be(gs)). In
particular, concerning this last reaction, predictions of \sigma_{abs} can
change by an order of magnitude depending on whether the halo properties
associated with the d_{5/2} orbital are treated selfconsistently in calculating
the ground state correlations of the (pair removal) mode, or not.

The process is initially in-control but is subject to random transition to one

find an optimal stopping rule under partial observation that maximizes the

partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) with the belief space
consisting of state probability vectors. New observations are obtained at fixed

optimal and that there exists a convex, non-increasing control limit that
partitions the belief space into two individually connected control regions: a
stopping region and a continuation region. We further derive the analytical

millisecond pulsar, HETE J1900.1-2455, based on observations performed
simultaneously by XMM-Newton and RXTE. The 0.33-50 keV spectrum is described by
the sum of a hard Comptonized component originated in an optically thin
{\tau}~1 corona, a soft kTin~0.2 keV component interpreted as accretion disc
emission, and of disc reflection of the hard component. Two emission features
are detected at energies of 0.98(1) and 6.58(7) keV, respectively. The latter
is identified as K{\alpha} transition of Fe XXIII-XXV. A simultaneous detection
in EPIC-pn, EPIC-MOS2, and RGS spectra favours an astrophysical origin also for
the former, which has an energy compatible with Fe-L{\alpha} and helium-like
Ne-K{\alpha} transitions. Broadness of the two features suggests a common
origin, resulting from reflection in an accretion disc with inclination of
(30+4{\deg}), and extending down to Rin=25(+16,-11) gravitational radii from
the compact object. However, the strength of the feature at lower energy
measured by EPIC-pn cannot be entirely reconciled with the amplitude of the Fe
K{\alpha} line, hampering the possibility of describing it in terms of a
broad-band reflection model, and preventing a firm identification. Pulsations
at the 377.3 Hz spin frequency could not be detected, with an upper limit of
0.4% at 3-{\sigma} c.l. on the fractional amplitude. We interpret the inner
disc radius estimated from spectral modelling and the lack of significant

properties of weighted projected networks, and suggest ways these could be used
beyond theoretical studies. Weighted projected networks typically exhibit
weight disorder along links even for very simple generating hypergraph
ensembles. Also, as the size of a hypergraph changes, a signature of multiway
interaction emerges on the link weights of weighted projected networks that
distinguishes them from fundamentally weighted pairwise networks. This
signature could be used to search for hidden multiway interactions in weighted
network data. I find the percolation threshold and size of the largest
component for hypergraphs of arbitrary uniform rank, translate the results into
projected networks, and show that the transition is second order. This general
approach to network formation has the potential to shed new light on our
understanding of weighted networks.

private classical information over arbitrary quantum channels. In the former
case, our coding scheme achieves the symmetric coherent information and in the
latter the symmetric private information. Both schemes are built from a polar
coding construction capable of transmitting classical information over a
quantum channel [Wilde and Guha, IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, in
press]. Appropriately merging two such classical-quantum schemes, one for
transmitting ""amplitude"" information and the other for transmitting ""phase,""
leads to the new private and quantum coding schemes, similar to the
construction for Pauli and erasure channels in [Renes, Dupuis, and Renner,
Physical Review Letters 109, 050504 (2012)]. The encoding is entirely similar
to the classical case, and thus efficient. The decoding can also be performed
by successive cancellation, as in the classical case, but no efficient
successive cancellation scheme is yet known for arbitrary quantum channels. An
efficient code construction is unfortunately still unknown. Generally, our two
coding schemes require entanglement or secret-key assistance, respectively, but
we extend two known conditions under which the needed assistance rate vanishes.
Finally, although our results are formulated for qubit channels, we show how
the scheme can be extended to multiple qubits. This then demonstrates a
near-explicit coding method for realizing one of the most striking phenomena in
quantum information theory: the superactivation effect, whereby two quantum
channels which individually have zero quantum capacity can have a non-zero
quantum capacity when used together.

Kepler spacecraft. Their orbits are significantly non-Keplerian because of the
large secondary-to-primary mass ratio and orbital eccentricity of the binaries,
as well as the proximity of the planets to the binaries. We present an analytic
theory, with the planet treated as a test particle, which shows that the
planetary motion can be represented by the superposition of the circular motion
of a guiding center, the forced oscillations due to the non-axisymmetric
components of the binary's potential, the epicyclic motion, and the vertical
motion. In this analytic theory, the periapse and ascending node of the planet
precess at nearly equal rates in opposite directions. The largest forced
oscillation term corresponds to a forced eccentricity (which is an explicit
function of the parameters of the binary and of the guiding center radius of
the planet), and the amplitude of the epicyclic motion (which is a free
parameter of the theory) is the free eccentricity. Comparisons with direct
numerical orbit integrations show that this analytic theory gives an accurate
description of the planetary motion for all three Kepler systems. We find that
all three Kepler circumbinary planets have nonzero free eccentricities.

  gene flow",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent explosion in available genetic data has led to significant
advances in understanding the demographic histories of and relationships among
human populations. It is still a challenge, however, to infer reliable
parameter values for complicated models involving many populations. Here we
present MixMapper, an efficient, interactive method for constructing
phylogenetic trees including admixture events using single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) genotype data. MixMapper implements a novel two-phase
approach to admixture inference using moment statistics, first building an
unadmixed scaffold tree and then adding admixed populations by solving systems
of equations that express allele frequency divergences in terms of mixture
parameters. Importantly, all features of the model, including topology, sources
of gene flow, branch lengths, and mixture proportions, are optimized
automatically from the data and include estimates of statistical uncertainty.
MixMapper also uses a new method to express branch lengths in easily
interpretable drift units. We apply MixMapper to recently published data for
HGDP individuals genotyped on a SNP array designed especially for use in
population genetics studies, obtaining confident results for 30 populations, 20
of them admixed. Notably, we confirm a signal of ancient admixture in European
populations---including previously undetected admixture in Sardinians and
Basques---involving a proportion of 20--40% ancient northern Eurasian ancestry.

two qualitatively different terms: The first term is similar to the collision
operator of the fermionic Boltzmann-Nordheim equation. The second term leads to
a momentum-dependent rotation of the spin basis. The rotation is determined by
a principal value integral which depends quadratically on the state of the

that the spatially homogeneous equation nevertheless has global solutions in

neighbor Hubbard model, provided that d >= 3. These assumptions suffice to
guarantee that, although possibly singular, the local rotation term is

often represented by a combination of thermal and power-law distributions.
However, the estimates of the number and total energy of non-thermal electrons
are sensitive to the determination of the power-law cutoff energy. Here we
revisit an `above-the-loop' coronal source observed by RHESSI on 2007 December
31 and show that a kappa distribution model can also be used to fit its
spectrum. Because the kappa distribution has a Maxwellian-like core in addition
to the high-energy power-law tail, the emission measure and temperature of the
instantaneous electrons can be derived without assuming the cutoff energy.
Moreover, the non-thermal fractions of electron number/energy densities can be
uniquely estimated because they are functions of the power-law index only. With
the kappa distribution model, we estimated that the total electron density of
the coronal source region was ~2.4x10^10 cm^-3. We also estimated without
assuming the source volume that a moderate fraction (~20%) of electrons in the
source region was non-thermal and carried ~52% of the total electron energy.
The temperature was 28 MK, and the power-law index d of the electron density
distribution was -4.3. These results are compared to the conventional power-law
models with and without a thermal core component.

users' signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) in a two-cell MIMO
broadcast channel. Assuming the users learn their direct and interfering
channels perfectly, they can feed back this information to the base stations
(BSs) over the uplink channels. The BSs then use the channel information to
design their transmission scheme. Two types of feedback are considered: analog
and digital. In the analog feedback case, the users send their unquantized and
uncoded CSI over the uplink channels. In this context, given a user's fixed
transmit power, we investigate how he/she should optimally allocate it to feed
back the direct and interfering (or cross) CSI for two types of base station
cooperation schemes, namely, Multi-Cell Processing (MCP) and Coordinated
Beamforming (CBf). In the digital feedback case, the direct and cross link
channel vectors of each user are quantized separately, each using RVQ, with
different size codebooks. The users then send the index of the quantization
vector in the corresponding codebook to the BSs. Similar to the feedback
optimization problem in the analog feedback, we investigate the optimal bit
partitioning for the direct and interfering link for both types of cooperation.

analysis in the large system limit in which the number of users per cell ($K$)
and the number of antennas per BS ($N$) tend to infinity with their ratio

non-rigid Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-fold is infinitely generated. This theorem builds
on an earlier method of hers which was implemented by Albano and Collino to
prove the same result for a general cubic sevenfold. In fact, Voisin's method
can be utilized precisely because the variation of Hodge structure on a cubic
7-fold behaves just like the variation of Hodge structure of a Calabi-Yau
3-fold. We explain this relationship concretely using Kontsevitch's
noncommutative geometry. Namely, we show that for a cubic 7-fold, there is a
noncommutative CY 3-fold which has an isomorphic Griffiths group.
  Similarly, one can consider other examples of Fano manifolds with with the
same type of variation of Hodge structure as a Calabi-Yau threefold (FCYs).
Among the complete intersections in weighted projective spaces, there are only
three classes of smooth FCY manifolds; the cubic 7-fold, the fivefold quartic
double solid, and the fivefold intersection of a quadric and a cubic. We settle
the two remaining cases, following Voisin's method to demonstrate that the
Griffiths group for a smooth general complete intersection FCY manifolds, is
also infinitely generated.
  In the case of the fivefold quartic double solid, we also show that there is
a noncommutative CY 3-fold with an isomorphic Griffiths group. Finally, for the
fivefold intersection of a quadric and a cubic there is a noncommutative CY
3-fold, such that the Griffiths group of the intersection surjects on to the
Griffiths group of noncommutative 3-fold. We finish by discussing some examples
of noncommutative covers which relate our noncommutative CYs back to honest

of periodic variability, clustering around 5.8 day (0.044 mag amplitude) and
1.28 day (0.016 mag amplitude) periods, after removal of overall baseline
variation. We attribute the unusual number of comparable strength signals to a
phenomenon related to the temporary increase in accretion rate associated with
FUors. We consider semi-random ""flickering"", magnetic braking/field compression
and rotational asymmetries in the disk instability region as potential sources
of variability. Assuming the 5.8 day period is due to stellar rotation and the
1.28 day period is indicative of Keplerian rotation at the inner radius of the
accretion disk (at 2 R(star)), we derive a B-field strength of 2.2-2.7 kG,
slightly larger than typical T Tauri stars. If instead the 5.8 day signal is
from a disk asymmetry, the instability region has an outer radius of 5.4

Delamination processes for linear elastic bodies glued by an adhesive to each

A concept of internal parameters is used here on the delaminating interfaces,
involving a couple of scalar damage variable and a plastic tangential slip with
kinematic-type hardening. The so-called energetic solution concept is employed.
An inelastic process at an interface is devised in such a way that the
dissipated energy depends only on the rates of internal parameters and
therefore the model is associative. A fully implicit time discretization is
combined with a spatial discretization of elastic bodies by the BEM to solve
the delamination problem. The BEM is used in the solution of the respective
boundary value problems, for each subdomain separately, to compute the
corresponding total potential energy. Sample problems are analysed by a
collocation BEM code to illustrate the capabilities of the numerical procedure

the nearby plasma. An analytical understanding of sheath behavior is therefore
important, both intrinsically and as an element in more elaborate theoretical

highly anharmonic waveforms, but no analytical model exists for this general

This aggregation is indirectly observed in real-time at regular intervals, so
that a longitudinal set of data is constructed that is then analysed for
evidence of this aggregation. The best existing test is based solely on the
final value of this set of data, which is compared against a threshold to
conclude whether or not aggregation, and thus sCJD, is present. This test
criterion was decided upon by analysing data from a total of 108 sCJD and
non-sCJD samples, but this was done subjectively and there is no supporting
mathematical analysis declaring this criterion to be exploiting the available
data optimally. This paper addresses this deficiency, seeking to validate or
improve the test primarily via support vector machine (SVM) classification.
Besides this, we address a number of additional issues such as i) early
stopping of the measurement process, ii) the possibility of detecting the

such as age, sex, disease duration and timing of CSF sampling into the

over long time-scales can thus be used to place an upper bound on the
gravitational-wave background. Using periastron time data from the Hulse-Taylor
binary pulsar spanning ~30 years, we obtain a bound of h_c < 7.9*10^(-14) at
~10^(-4) Hz, where h_c is the strain amplitude per logarithmic frequency
interval. Our constraint complements those from pulsar timing arrays, which
probe much lower frequencies, and ground-based gravitational-wave observations,
which probe much higher frequencies. Interesting sources in our frequency band,
which overlaps the lower sensitive frequencies of proposed space-based
observatories, include white-dwarf/supermassive black-hole binaries in the
early/late stages of inspiral, and TeV scale preheating or phase transitions.
The bound improves as (time span)^(-2) and (sampling rate)^(-1/2). The
Hulse-Taylor constraint can be improved to ~3.8*10^(-15) with a suitable
observational campaign over the next decade. Our approach can also be applied
to other binaries, including (with suitable care) the Earth-Moon system, to
obtain constraints at different frequencies. The observation of additional
binary pulsars with the SKA could reach a sensitivity of h_c ~ 3*10^(-17).

processes occurring in those galaxies, starting here with the dense
star-forming gas. We use existing integrated $^{12}$CO(1-0, 2-1),
$^{13}$CO(1-0, 2-1), HCN(1-0) and HCO$^{+}$(1-0) observations and present new
$^{12}$CO(3-2) single-dish data. From these, we derive for the first time the
average kinetic temperature, H$_{2}$ volume density and column density of the
emitting gas, this using a non-LTE theoretical model. Since the CO lines trace
different physical conditions than of those the HCN and HCO$^{+}$ lines, the
two sets of lines are treated separately. We also compare for the first time
the predicted CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) and gas properties
of our molecular gas-rich ETGs with those of a sample of nearby well-studied
disc galaxies. The gas excitation conditions in 13 of our 18 ETGs appear
analogous to those in the centre of the Milky Way. Such results have never been
obtained before for ETGs and open a new window to explore further
star-formation processes in the Universe. The conclusions drawn should
nevertheless be considered carefully, as they are based on a limited number of
observations and on a simple model. In the near future, with higher CO
transition observations, it should be possible to better identify the various
gas components present in ETGs, as well as more precisely determine their
associated physical conditions. To achieve these goals, we show here from our
theoretical study, that mid-J CO lines (such as the $^{12}$CO(6-5) line) are
particularly useful.

played by a diverging host density of states is examined in detail, with
distinctive signatures associated with the powerlaw Kondo effect shown to

enhanced Kondo temperature. Although the effective Kondo model supports a novel
stable phase characterized by strong renormalized particle-hole asymmetry, we
find that this phase cannot in fact be accessed in the full Anderson model. In
the more realistic case where the divergence in the host density of states is
cut off at low energies, a crossover is generated between pristine powerlaw
Kondo physics and a regular Kondo strong coupling state.

M87. We conserve relativistic energy-momentum and particle number along the jet
and calculate the observed synchrotron emission from the jet by calculating the
integrated line of sight synchrotron opacity through the jet in the rest frame
of each section of plasma. We calculate the inverse-Compton emission from
synchrotron, CMB, accretion disc, starlight, broad line region, dusty torus and
narrow line region photons by transforming into the rest frame of the plasma
along the jet.
  We fit our model to simultaneous multi-wavelength observations of the
Compton-dominant FSRQ type blazar PKS0227-369, with a jet geometry set by M87
and an accelerating bulk Lorentz factor consistent with simulations and theory.
We investigate models in which the jet comes into equipartition at different
distances along the jet and equipartition is maintained via the conversion of
jet bulk kinetic energy into particle acceleration. We find that the jet must
still be magnetically dominated within the BLR and cannot be in equipartition
due to the severe radiative energy losses. The model fits the observations,
including radio data, very well if the jet comes into equipartition outside the
BLR within the dusty torus (1.5pc) or at further distances (34pc). We find that
our fit in which the jet comes into equipartition furthest along the jet, which
has a jet with the geometry of M87 scaled linearly with black hole mass, has an
inferred black hole mass close to previous estimates. This implies that the jet
of PKS0227 might be well described by the same jet geometry as M87.

expect them to form binaries in galactic nuclei surrounded by a circumbinary

trigger stellar formation in situ. In this first paper we address the evolution
of the binary under the influence of the newly formed stars, which form
individually and also clustered. We use SPH techniques to evolve the gas in the
circumbinary disc and to study the phase of star formation. When the amount of
gas in the disc is negligible, we further evolve the system with a
high-accurate direct-summation $N-$body code to follow the evolution of the
stars, the innermost binary and tidal disruption events (TDEs). For this, we
modify the direct N-body code to (i) include treatment of TDEs and to (ii)
include ""gas cloud particles"" that mimic the gas, so that the stellar clusters
do not disolve when we follow their infall on to the MBHs. We find that the

attractive means of raising the Higgs mass through non-decoupling D-term

evolution of massive galaxies, we explore the detailed photometric structure of
a representative sample of 94 bright, nearby elliptical galaxies, using
high-quality optical images from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey. The sample
spans a range of environments and stellar masses, from M* = 10^{10.2} to
10^{12.0} solar mass. We exploit the unique capabilities of two-dimensional
image decomposition to explore the possibility that local elliptical galaxies
may contain photometrically distinct substructure that can shed light on their
evolutionary history. Compared with the traditional one-dimensional approach,
these two-dimensional models are capable of consistently recovering the surface
brightness distribution and the systematic radial variation of geometric
information at the same time. Contrary to conventional perception, we find that
the global light distribution of the majority (>75%) of elliptical galaxies is
not well described by a single Sersic function. Instead, we propose that local
elliptical galaxies generically contain three subcomponents: a compact (R_e < 1
kpc) inner component with luminosity fraction f ~ 0.1-0.15; an
intermediate-scale (R_e ~ 2.5 kpc) middle component with f ~ 0.2-0.25; and a
dominant (f = 0.6), extended (R_e ~ 10 kpc) outer envelope. All subcomponents
have average Sersic indices n ~ 1-2, significantly lower than the values
typically obtained from single-component fits. The individual subcomponents
follow well-defined photometric scaling relations and the stellar mass-size
relation. We discuss the physical nature of the substructures and their
implications for the formation of massive elliptical galaxies.

expected photoacoustic frequency bandwidth (a few MHz to tens of kHz) is
inversely proportional to the dimensions of light absorbing structures (0.5 to
10+ mm), proper choices of materials and their geometries, and proper

In this study, we design and evaluate a specialized ultrasound detector for
photoacoustic mammography. Based on the required detector sensitivity and its
frequency response, a selection of active material and matching layers and
their geometries is made leading to a functional detector models. By iteration
between simulation of detector performances, fabrication and experimental
characterization of functional models an optimized implementation is made and
evaluated. The experimental results of the designed first and second functional

samples the effect of lateral resonances was addressed and their influence
minimized by sub-dicing the samples. Consequently, using simulations, the final
optimized detector could be designed, with a center frequency of 1 MHz and a -6
dB bandwidth of ~80%. The minimum detectable pressure was measured to be 0.5
Pa, which will facilitate deeper imaging compared to the currrent systems. The

phases of star formation in the Universe. In order to understand the physical
processes involved in this mode of star formation, it is essential to gain
knowledge about the dark matter structures - most importantly their masses -
that sub-millimetre galaxies live in. Here we use the magnification effect of
gravitational lensing to determine the average mass and dust content of
sub-millimetre galaxies with 250mu flux densities of S_250>15mJy selected using
data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey. The positions of
hundreds of sub-millimetre foreground lenses are cross-correlated with the
positions of background Lyman-break galaxies at z~3-5 selected using optical
data from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We detect a
cross-correlation signal at the 7-sigma level over a sky area of one square
degree, with ~80% of this signal being due to magnification, whereas the
remaining ~20% comes from dust extinction. Adopting some simple assumptions for
the dark matter and dust profiles and the redshift distribution enables us to
estimate the average mass of the halos hosting the sub-millimetre galaxies to
be log(M_200/M_sun)=13.17+0.05-0.08(stat.) and their average dust mass fraction
(at radii of >10kpc) to be M_dust/M_200~6x10^-5. This supports the picture that
sub-millimetre galaxies are dusty, forming stars at a high rate, reside in
massive group-sized halos, and are a crucial phase in the assembly and
evolution of structure in the Universe.

by means of N-body simulations, we explore the time scales and the dynamics of
the spatial mixing of the FG and the SG populations and their dependence on the
SG initial concentration.Our simulations show that, as the evolution proceeds,
the radial profile of the SG/FG number ratio, NSG/NFG, is characterized by
three regions: 1) a flat inner part; 2) a declining part in which FG stars are
increasingly dominant; and 3) an outer region where the NSG/NFG profile
flattens again (the NSG/NFG profile may rise slightly again in the outermost
cluster regions). The radial variation of NSG/NFG implies that the fraction of
SG stars determined by observations covering a limited range of radial
distances is not, in general, equal to the SG global fraction, (NSG/NFG)glob.
The distance at which NSG/NFG equals (NSG/NFG)glob is approximately between 1

many Galactic globular clusters the SG should still be more spatially
concentrated than the FG.[abridged]

positing a spectrum of light higgsinos <~ 200-300 GeV and light top squarks <~
600 GeV along with very heavy squarks and TeV-scale gluinos. Such models have
low electroweak fine-tuning and satisfy the LHC constraints. However, in the
context of the MSSM, they predict too low a value of m(h), are frequently in
conflict with the measured b\to s\gamma branching fraction and the relic
density of thermally produced higgsino-like WIMPs falls well below dark matter
(DM) measurements. We propose ""radiative natural SUSY"" (RNS) which can be
realized within the MSSM (avoiding the addition of extra exotic matter) and
which maintains features such as gauge coupling unification and radiative
electroweak symmetry breaking. The RNS model can be generated from SUSY GUT
type models with non-universal Higgs masses (NUHM). Allowing for high scale
soft SUSY breaking Higgs mass m_{H_u}> m_0 leads to automatic cancellations
during renormalization group (RG) running, and to radiatively-induced low
fine-tuning at the electroweak scale. Coupled with large mixing in the top
squark sector, RNS allows for fine-tuning at the 3-10% level with TeV-scale top
squarks and a 125 GeV light Higgs scalar h. The model allows for at least a
partial solution to the SUSY flavor, CP and gravitino problems since
first/second generation scalars (and the gravitino) may exist in the 10-30 TeV
regime. We outline some possible signatures for RNS at the LHC and at a linear
e^+e^- collider. If the strong CP problem is solved by the Peccei-Quinn
mechanism, then RNS naturally accommodates mixed axion-higgsino cold dark
matter, where the light higgsino-like WIMPS - which in this case make up only a
fraction of the measured relic abundance - should be detectable at upcoming
WIMP detectors.

simulations of the redshifted 21 cm signal during reionization with thermal
noise at the level expected for a 500 antenna tile version of the Murchison
Widefield Array (MWA), and mimic the degrading effects of foreground cleaning.
Using a matched filter technique, we find that the MWA should be able to
directly identify ionized regions despite the large thermal noise. In a
plausible fiducial model in which ~20% of the volume of the Universe is neutral
at z ~ 7, we find that a 500-tile MWA may directly identify as many as ~150
ionized regions in a 6 MHz portion of its survey volume and roughly determine
the size of each of these regions. This may, in turn, allow interesting
multi-wavelength follow-up observations, comparing galaxy properties inside and
outside of ionized regions. We discuss how the optimal configuration of radio
antenna tiles for detecting ionized regions with a matched filter technique
differs from the optimal design for measuring power spectra. These
considerations have potentially important implications for the design of future
redshifted 21 cm surveys.

In the
classic view, relaxed selection allows cryptic genetic diversity to build up
across individuals in a population, providing alleles that may later contribute
to adaptation when co-opted - e.g. following a mutation increasing expression
from a low, attenuated baseline. This view is described, for example, by the
metaphor of the spread of a population across a neutral network in genotype
space. As an alternative view, consider the fact that most phenotypic traits
are affected by multiple sequences, including cryptic ones. Even in a strictly
clonal population, the co-option of cryptic sequences at different loci may
have different phenotypic effects and offer the population multiple adaptive
possibilities. Here, we model the evolution of quantitative phenotypic
characters encoded by cryptic sequences, and compare the relative contributions
of genetic diversity and of variation across sites to the phenotypic potential
of a population. We show that most of the phenotypic variation accessible
through co-option would exist even in populations with no polymorphism. This is
made possible by a history of compensatory evolution, whereby the phenotypic
effect of a cryptic mutation at one site was balanced by mutations elsewhere in
the genome, leading to a diversity of cryptic effect sizes across sites rather
than across individuals. Cryptic sequences might accelerate adaptation and
facilitate large phenotypic changes even in the absence of genetic diversity,
as traditionally defined in terms of alternative alleles.

exceeded the ice line temperature (T_Ice ~ 150-170 K) during formation for a

within these systems will thus not have an ice line, decreasing the total
material available for building protoplanetary embryos, inhibiting the
formation of gas- and ice-giants if they form by core accretion, and
prohibiting habitability. Planet formation by gravitational instability is
similarly suppressed because Toomre's Q > 1 in all but the most massive disks.
I discuss these results in the context of the observed lack of planets in 47
Tuc. I predict that a similar search for planets in the globular cluster NGC

  We show that for an $n=2$-particle chain under tensile stress the index 2
saddle plays a central role in organizing the dynamics. We apply normal form
theory to analyze phase space structure and dynamics in a neighborhood of the
index 2 saddle. We define a phase dividing surface (DS) that enables us to
classify trajectories passing through a neighborhood of the saddle point using
the values of the integrals associated with the normal form. We also generalize
our definition of the dividing surface and define an \emph{extended dividing
surface} (EDS), which is used to sample and classify all trajectories that pass
through a phase space neighborhood of the index 2 saddle at total energies less
than that of the saddle.
  Classical trajectory simulations are used to study single versus double bond
breakage for the $n=2$ chain under tension. Initial conditions for trajectories
are obtained by sampling the EDS at constant energy. We sample trajectories at
fixed energies both above and below the energy of the saddle. The fate of
trajectories (single versus double bond breakage) is explored as a function of
the location of the initial condition on the EDS, and a connection made to the
work of Chesnavich on collision-induced dissociation. A significant finding is
that we can readily identify trajectories that exhibit bond \emph{healing}.
Such trajectories pass outside the nominal (index 1) transition state for
single bond dissociation, but return to the potential well region, possibly
several times, before ultimately dissociating.

suggesting that the rotation of the stripe direction from one plane to the next
generates a helical pattern that breaks chiral symmetry. In order to further
test this chiral stacking hypothesis it is necessary to develop an
understanding of the physical mechanism by which chirality generates gyrotropy.
In this paper we show that optical gyrotropy is a consequence of Berry
curvature in the momentum space of chiral metals. We describe a physical
picture showing that gyrotropy in chiral metals is closely related to the
anomalous Hall effect in itinerant ferromagnets. We then calculate the
magnitude of the gyrotropic response for a given Berry curvature using the
semiclassical picture of anomalous velocity and Boltzmann transport theory. To
connect this physical picture with experiment, we calculate the Berry curvature
in two tight-binding models. The first model is motivated by the structure of
LBCO and illustrates how the gyrotropy is created when the stripe perturbations
are added to a simple cubic model. In the second model, we examine the dramatic
enhancement of the gyrotropic coefficient when Rashba spin-orbit coupling is
introduced. The magnitude of the rotation of polarization on reflection

special case where the tensor in question is super-symmetric with an even
degree. In that case, the tensor can be embedded into a symmetric matrix. We
prove that if the tensor is rank-one, then the embedded matrix must be rank-one
too, and vice versa. The tensor PCA problem can thus be solved by means of
matrix optimization under a rank-one constraint, for which we propose two
solution methods: (1) imposing a nuclear norm penalty in the objective to
enforce a low-rank solution; (2) relaxing the rank-one constraint by
Semidefinite Programming. Interestingly, our experiments show that both methods
yield a rank-one solution with high probability, thereby solving the original
tensor PCA problem to optimality with high probability. To further cope with
the size of the resulting convex optimization models, we propose to use the
alternating direction method of multipliers, which reduces significantly the
computational efforts. Various extensions of the model are considered as well.

conclusion that is consistent with the information drawn from the inspection of
the topological degeneracy on the same state. We find both a long ranged RVB
amplitude and an approximate Marshall sign structure are at the origin of the
suppression of vison gap in this spin liquid state. On the other hand, robust
signature of $Z_{2}$ topological order, i.e., a TEE of $\ln2$, is clearly
demonstrated for a Gutzwiiler projected RVB state on triangular lattice which
is evolved from the RVB state proposed originally by Anderson\cite{Sorella}. We
also find that it is the sign, rather than the amplitude of the RVB wave
function, that dominates the TEE and is responsible for a positive value of
TEE, which implies that the nonlocal entanglement in the RVB state is mainly
encoded in the sign of the RVB wave function. Our results indicate that some
information that is important for the topological property of a RVB state is
missed in the effective field theory description and that a $Z_{2}$ gauge
structure in the saddle point action is not enough for the RVB state to exhibit
topological order, even if its spin correlation is extremely short ranged.

balance should be in equilibrium, even if its beam is not horizontal (we have
considered the beam to be straight and have no thickness, an ideal case). Thus,
although the weights are equal, they will appear different which is puzzling.
This also shows that the concept of equilibrium is confusing, especially

the possibility of the shape resonances in superconducting gaps. Shape
resonances belong to class of Fano resonances in configuration interaction
between open and closed scattering channels. The Shape resonances arise because
of the exchange interaction, a Josephson-like term, for transfer of pairs
between different condensates in different Fermi surface spots in the special
cases where at least one Fermi surface is near a 2.5 Lifshitz topological
transition. We show that tuning the shape resonances show first, the gap
suppression (like a Fano anti-resonance) driven by configuration interaction
between a BCS condensate and a BEC-like condensate, and second, the gap
amplification (like a Fano resonance) driven by configuration interaction
between BCS condensates in large and small Fermi surfaces. Shape resonances
usually occur in granular nanoscale complex matter (called superstripes)
because of the lattice instability near a 2.5 Lifshitz transition in presence
of interactions. Using a new imaging method, scanning nano-X-ray diffraction,
we have shown the generic formation in high temperature superconductors of a
granular superconducting networks made of striped puddles formed by ordered
oxygen interstitials or ordered local lattice distortions (like static short
range charge density waves). In the superconducting puddles the chemical
potential is tuned to a shape resonance in superconducting gaps and the maximum

light curves of the X-ray and soft gamma-ray radiations of the spin-down

are created around the null charge surface and the gap's electric field
separates the two charges to move in opposite directions. Consequently, the
region from the null charge surface to the light cylinder is dominated by the
outflow current while that from the null charge surface to the star is
dominated by the inflow current. We suggest that the viewing angle of PSR
B1509-58 only receives the inflow radiation. The incoming curvature photons are
converted to pairs by the strong magnetic field of the star. The X-rays and
soft gamma-rays of PSR B1509-58 result from the synchrotron radiation of these
pairs. Magnetic pair creation requires a large pitch angle, which makes the
pulse profile of the synchrotron radiation distinct from that of the curvature
radiation. We carefully trace the pulse profiles of the synchrotron radiation
with different pitch angles. We find that the differences between the light
curves of different energy bands are due to the different pitch angles of the
secondary pairs, and that the second peak appearing at E>10MeV comes from the
region near the star, where the stronger magnetic field allows pair creation to
happen with a smaller pitch angle.

microdroplet in air, air microbubble in water, and a special oil-emulsion in
water system used in experiments with optical deformation of fluid interfaces.
We compare interface deformations of the three systems when illuminated by a
wide (compared to particle radius) and narrow laser beams and analyse
differences. Deformations of droplets are radically different from bubbles
under otherwise identical conditions, due to the opposite lensing effect
(converging and diverging, respectively) of the two; a droplet is deformed far
more than a bubble, cetera paribus. Optical contrast is found to be of great
importance to the shape obtained when comparing the relatively low-contrast
oil-emulsion system to that of water droplets. We finally analyse the dynamics
of particle motion when the laser beam is turned on, and compare a static beam
to the case of a short pulse. The very different surface tension coefficient
implies a very different time scale for dynamics: microseconds for the
water-air interface and tens of milliseconds for the oil-emulsion. Surface
oscillations of a water microdroplet are found always to be underdamped, while
those of the oil-emulsion are overdamped; deformations of a microbubble can be
either, depending on physical parameters.

investigated its expressions in the cases of covariance-stationary processes

estimator of this sensitivity matrix in the case of conditionally

hypotheses can so be tested as for instance the hypothesis that the data
generating process is ""almost"" independently distributed at a given moment.

advection-diffusion formalism and the simpler purely diffusive one. The full
evolution from the Pre Main Sequence up to the presupernova stage is followed
in detail with a very extended nuclear network. The explosive yields are
provided for a variety of possible mass cut and are available at the website
\url{http://www.iasf-roma.inaf.it/orfeo/public{\_}html}.
  We find that both the He and the CO core masses are larger than those of
their non rotating counterparts. Also the C abundance left by the He burning is
lower than in the non rotating case, especially for stars of initial mass 13-25
\msun, and this affects the final Mass-Radius relation, basically the final
binding energy, at the presupernova stage. The elemental yields produced by a
generation of stars rotating initially at 300 km/s do not change substantially
with respect to those produced by a generation of non rotating massive stars,
the main differences being a slight overproduction of the weak s-component and
a larger production of F. Since rotation also affects the mass loss rate,
either directly and indirectly, we find substantial differences in the
lifetimes as O-type and WR-subtypes between rotating and non rotating models.
The maximum mass exploding as type IIP supernova ranges between 15 and 20\msun

induced fractures are created by a combination of in situ and thermal stresses,
and that the extent to which thermally induced tensile wall fractures are
created largely depends on how the wellbores are oriented with respect to the
pre-existing stresses of the reservoir. If the system is not optimized with
respect to in situ stresses, the risk of wellbore instability becomes severe
within less than a year of production. In contrast, if the orientation of the
wellbores is optimized, thermally induced instabilities can be completely
excluded as potential risks for the operational lifetime of the system.

Real-Time Systems Symposium 2012] for representing recurrent

each recurrent task is modeled by a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a period, and
a relative deadline. Each vertex of the DAG represents a sequential job, while
the edges of the DAG represent precedence constraints between these jobs. All
the jobs of the DAG are released simultaneously and have to be completed within
some specified relative deadline. The task may release jobs in this manner an
unbounded number of times, with successive releases occurring at least the
specified period apart. The feasibility problem is to determine whether such a
recurrent task can be scheduled to always meet all deadlines on a specified

  The case of a single task has been considered in [Baruah et al., 2012]. The
main contribution of this paper is to consider the case of multiple tasks. We
show that EDF has a speedup bound of 2-1/m, where m is the number of
processors. Moreover, we present polynomial and pseudopolynomial schedulability
tests, of differing effectiveness, for determining whether a set of sporadic

which can be explained by the presence of optically thick matter located ahead
of the planet at a distance of 4-5 planet radii. This work follows previous
attempts to explain this asymmetry with an exospheric outflow or a bow shock,
induced by a planetary magnetic field, and provides a numerical solution of the
early-ingress, though we did not perform any radiative transfer calculation. We
performed pure 3D gas dynamic simulations of the plasma interaction between
WASP-12b and its host star, and describe the flow pattern in the system. In
particular, we show that the overfilling of the planet's Roche lobe leads to a
noticeable outflow from the upper atmosphere in the direction of the L1 and L2
points. Due to the conservation of the angular momentum, the flow to the L1
point is deflected in the direction of the planet's orbital motion, while the
flow towards L2 is deflected in the opposite direction, resulting in a
non-axisymmetric envelope, surrounding the planet. The supersonic motion of the
planet inside the stellar wind leads to the formation of a bow shock with a
complex shape. The existence of the bow shock slows down the outflow through
the L1 and L2 points, allowing us to consider a long-living flow structure
which is in the steady-state.

strongly anisotropic behavior and the mentioned anomalous Josephson effects
follow. We show that the situation is not restricted to barriers based on
constrictions such as QPCs and should generically arise if in the normal system
the direction of the carrier's spin is linked to its direction of motion.

invention. This complexity and the availability of large number of recorded
matches make chess an ideal model systems for the study of population-level
learning of a complex system. We systematically investigate the move-by-move
dynamics of the white player's advantage from over seventy thousand high level
chess matches spanning over 150 years. We find that the average advantage of
the white player is positive and that it has been increasing over time.
Currently, the average advantage of the white player is ~0.17 pawns but it is
exponentially approaching a value of 0.23 pawns with a characteristic time
scale of 67 years. We also study the diffusion of the move dependence of the
white player's advantage and find that it is non-Gaussian, has long-ranged
anti-correlations and that after an initial period with no diffusion it becomes
super-diffusive. We find that the duration of the non-diffusive period,
corresponding to the opening stage of a match, is increasing in length and
exponentially approaching a value of 15.6 moves with a characteristic time
scale of 130 years. We interpret these two trends as a resulting from learning
of the features of the game. Additionally, we find that the exponent {\alpha}
characterizing the super-diffusive regime is increasing toward a value of 1.9,
close to the ballistic regime. We suggest that this trend is due to the
increased broadening of the range of abilities of chess players participating
in major tournaments.

simulations of the Local Universe. Our method, the Reverse Zeldovich
Approximation (RZA), can be applied to radial galaxy peculiar velocity data and
extends the previously used Constrained Realizations (CR) method by adding a
Lagrangian reconstruction step. The RZA method consists of applying the
Zeldovich approximation in reverse to galaxy peculiar velocities to estimate
the cosmic displacement field and the initial linear matter distribution from
which the present-day Local Universe evolved.We test our method with a mock
survey taken from a cosmological simulation. We show that the halo peculiar
velocities at z = 0 are close to the linear prediction of the Zeldovich
approximation, if a grouping is applied to the data to remove virial motions.
We find that the addition of RZA to the CR method significantly improves the
reconstruction of the initial conditions. The RZA is able to recover the
correct initial positions of the velocity tracers with a median error of only
1.36 Mpc/h in our test simulation. For realistic sparse and noisy data, this
median increases to 5 Mpc/h. This is a significant improvement over the
previous approach of neglecting the displacement field, which introduces errors
on a scale of 10 Mpc/h or even higher. Applying the RZA method to the upcoming
high-quality observational peculiar velocity catalogues will generate much more
precise constrained simulations of the Local Universe.

the sparseness of the data points, and the maximum catalogue radius (3000 -
6000 km/s). We perform the RZA reconstruction of the initial conditions on
these mock catalogues and compare with the actual initial conditions of the
simulation. We also investigate the impact of the fact that only the radial
part of the peculiar velocity is observationally accessible. We find that the
sparseness of a dataset has the highest detrimental effect on RZA
reconstruction quality. Observational distance errors also have a significant
influence, but it is possible to compensate this relatively well with Wiener
Filter reconstruction. We also investigate the effect of different object
selection criteria and find that distance catalogues distributed randomly and
homogeneously across the sky (such as spiral galaxies selected for the
Tully-Fisher method) allow for a higher reconstruction quality than if when
data is preferentially drawn from massive objects or dense environments (such
as elliptical galaxies). We find that the error of estimating the initial
conditions with RZA is always dominated by the inherent non-linearity of data
observed at z=0 rather than by the combined effect of the observational errors.
Even an extremely sparse dataset with high observational errors still leads to
a good reconstruction of the initial conditions on a scale of about 5 Mpc/h.

method, which can be used to estimate the cosmological initial conditions
underlying the galaxy distribution in the Local Universe using peculiar
velocity data. In this paper, we apply the technique to run constrained
cosmological simulations from the RZA-reconstructed initial conditions,
designed to reproduce the large-scale structure of the Local Universe. We test
the method with mock peculiar velocity catalogues extracted from a reference
simulation. We first reconstruct the initial conditions of this reference
simulation using the mock data, and then run the reconstructed initial
conditions forward in time until z=0. We compare the resulting constrained
simulations with the original simulation at z=0 to test the accuracy of this
method. We also compare them with constrained simulations run from the mock
data without the addition of RZA, i.e. using only the currently established
constrained realizations (CR) method. Our re-simulations are able to correctly
recover the evolution of the large-scale structure underlying the data. The
results show that the addition of RZA to the CR method significantly improves
both the reconstruction of the initial conditions and the accuracy of the
obtained constrained resimulations. Haloes from the original simulation are
recovered in the re-simulations with an average accuracy of about 2 Mpc/h on
their position and a factor of 2 in mass, down to haloes with a mass of approx
10^14 M_odot/h. In comparison, without RZA the re-simulations recover only the
most massive haloes with masses of about 5x10^14 M_odot/h and higher, and with
a systematic shift on their position of about approx 10 Mpc/h due to the cosmic
displacement field. We show that with the additional Lagrangian reconstruction
step introduced by the RZA, this shift can be removed.

of three spacecraft, each of which orbits near one of the Sun-Earth Lagrange

triangle. The 3 spacecraft range interferometrically with one another with an
arm length of about 260 million kilometers. The orbits have been optimized
resulting in arm length changes of less than 0.00015 AU or, fractionally, less

while VAL recorded to have the least flexibility. General trends in decrement
of B-Factors conformed to the general trend in the order of emergence of
protein structural domains. Decrement of B-Factor is observed to be most
decisive (monotonic and uniform) for VAL, while evolution of CYS and LYS
flexibility is found to be most skewed. Barring CYS, flexibility of all the
residues is found to have increased during evolution of alpha by beta folds,
however flexibility of all the residues (barring CYS) is found to have
decreased during evolution of all beta folds. Only in alpha by beta folds the
tendency of preferring higher residue mobility could be observed, neither alpha
plus beta, nor all alpha nor all beta folds were found to support higher
residue-mobility. In all the structural classes, the effect of evolutionary
constraint on polar residues is found to follow an exactly identical trend as
that on hydrophobic residues, only the extent of these effects are found to be
different. Though protein size is found to be decreasing during evolution,
residue mobility of proteins belonging to ancient and old structural domains
showed strong positive dependency upon protein size, however for medieval and

entropy of trajectories of an irreducible finite state Markov chain. Numerous
applications, including the study of random walks on graphs, require the
computation of the entropy of Markov trajectories conditioned on a set of
intermediate states. However, the expression of Ekroot and Cover does not allow
for computing this quantity. In this paper, we propose a method to compute the
entropy of conditional Markov trajectories through a transformation of the
original Markov chain into a Markov chain that exhibits the desired conditional
distribution of trajectories. Moreover, we express the entropy of Markov
trajectories - a global quantity - as a linear combination of local entropies
associated with the Markov chain states.

are rooted in the delusionary belief in policies based on a ""perpetual money
machine"" type of thinking. We document strong evidence that, since the early
1980s, consumption has been increasingly funded by smaller savings, booming
financial profits, wealth extracted from house price appreciation and explosive
debt. This is in stark contrast with the productivity-fueled growth that was
seen in the 1950s and 1960s. This transition, starting in the early 1980s, was
further supported by a climate of deregulation and a massive growth in
financial derivatives designed to spread and diversify the risks globally. The
result has been a succession of bubbles and crashes, including the worldwide
stock market bubble and great crash of October 1987, the savings and loans
crisis of the 1980s, the burst in 1991 of the enormous Japanese real estate and
stock market bubbles, the emerging markets bubbles and crashes in 1994 and

house price bubbles, the financialization bubble via special investment
vehicles, the stock market bubble, the commodity and oil bubbles and the debt
bubbles, all developing jointly and feeding on each other. Rather than still
hoping that real wealth will come out of money creation, we need fundamentally
new ways of thinking. In uncertain times, it is essential, more than ever, to
think in scenarios: what can happen in the future, and, what would be the
effect on your wealth and capital? How can you protect against adverse
scenarios? We thus end by examining the question ""what can we do?"" from the

has the Dirac equation as emergent. This model, a discrete-time and causal
unitary evolution of a lattice of quantum systems, is derived from the
assumptions of homogeneity, parity and time-reversal invariance. The comparison
between the automaton and the Dirac evolutions is rigorously set as a
discrimination problem between unitary channels. We derive an exact lower bound
for the probability of error in the discrimination as an explicit function of
the mass, the number and the momentum of the particles, and the duration of the
evolution. Computing this bound with experimentally achievable values, we see
that in that regime the QCA model cannot be discriminated from the usual Dirac
evolution. Finally, we show that the evolution of one-particle states with
narrow-band in momentum can be effi- ciently simulated by a dispersive
differential equation for any regime. This analysis allows for a comparison
with the dynamics of wave-packets as it is described by the usual Dirac
equation. This paper is a first step in exploring the idea that quantum field
theory could be grounded on a more fundamental quantum cellular automaton model
and that physical dynamics could emerge from quantum information processing. In
this framework, the discretization is a central ingredient and not only a tool
for performing non-perturbative calculation as in lattice gauge theory. The
automaton model, endowed with a precise notion of local observables and a full
probabilistic interpretation, could lead to a coherent unification of an
hypothetical discrete Planck scale with the usual Fermi scale of high-energy
physics.

wind-fed X-ray pulsars (XPSRs) at X-ray luminosities <4 10^{36} erg/s. In this
regime the accreting matter settles down subsonically onto the rotating
magnetosphere, forming an extended quasi-static shell. The shell mediates the
angular momentum removal from the rotating NS magnetosphere by shear turbulent
viscosity in the boundary layer or via large-scale convective motions. In the
last case the differential rotation law in the shell is close to
iso-angular-momentum rotation. The accretion rate through the shell is
determined by the ability of the plasma to enter the magnetosphere due to
Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities while taking cooling into account. Measurements
of spin-up/spin-down rates of quasi-spherically wind accreting XPSRs in
equilibrium with known orbital periods (like e.g. GX 301-2 and Vela X-1) enable
determination of the main dimensionless parameters of the model and the NS
magnetic field. For equilibrium pulsars with independent measurements of the
magnetic field, the stellar wind velocity from the companion can be estimated
without the use of complicated spectroscopic measurements. For non-equilibrium
pulsars, a maximum possible spin-down torque exerted on the accreting NS
exists. From observations of the spin-down rate and X-ray luminosity in such
pulsars (GX 1+4, SXP 1062, 4U 2206+54, etc.) a lower limit on the NS magnetic
field is derived, which in all cases turns out to be close to the standard one
and in agreement with cyclotron line measurements. The model explains the
existence of super slowly rotating XPSRs without the need to hypothesize on
additional accretion properties and magnetar-like magnetic fields in accreting
neutron stars.

expect that several systematic noise sources on the measurement of precise

stellar companion within the fiber is such a possible noise source. Aims: With
this work we aim at characterizing the impact of a stellar companion within the
fiber to radial velocity measurements made by fiber-fed spectrographs. We
consider the contaminant star either to be part of a binary system whose
primary star is the target star, or as a background/foreground star. Methods:
To carry out our study, we used HARPS spectra, co-added the target with
contaminant spectra, and then compared the resulting radial velocity with that
obtained from the original target spectrum. We repeated this procedure and used
different tunable knobs to reproduce the previously mentioned scenarios.
Results: We find that the impact on the radial velocity calculation is a
function of the difference between individual radial velocities, of the
difference between target and contaminant magnitude, and also of their spectral
types. For the worst-case scenario in which both target and contaminant star
are well centered on the fiber, the maximum contamination for a G or K star may
be higher than 10 cm/s, on average, if the difference between target and
contaminant magnitude is $\Delta m$ < 10, and higher than 1 m/s if $\Delta m$ <
8. If the target star is of spectral type M, $\Delta m$ < 8 produces the same
contamination of 10 cm/s, and a contamination may be higher than 1 m/s

mission-Newton observation, 133 ks, of the low luminosity active galactic
nucleus NGC 7213. The hardness ratio analysis of the X-ray light curves
discloses a rather constant X-ray spectral shape, at least for the observed
exposure time, enabling us to perform X-ray spectral studies using the total
observed spectrum. Apart from a neutral Fe K\alpha emission line, we also
detect narrow emission lines from the ionised iron species, Fe xxv and Fe xxvi.
Our analysis suggests that the neutral Fe K\alpha originates from a
Compton-thin reflector, while the gas responsible for the high ionisation lines
is collisionally excited. The overall spectrum, in the 0.3-10 keV energy band,
registered by the European Photon Imaging Camera, can be modelled by a
power-law component (with a slope of \Gamma\simeq1.9) plus two thermal
components at 0.36 and 8.84 keV. The low-energy thermal component is entirely
consistent with the X-ray spectral data obtained by the Reflection Grating
Spectrometer between 0.35-1.8 keV.

Readers must often use visual queues, audible queues from reading out loud, and
their knowledge and understanding of current events to understand a post. For
analysis of popular trends, the specific problem is that it is difficult to
build a lexicon when the invention of new ways to refer to a word or concept is

discretization that is used throughout the entire network. \ In this paper, we
present and compare a wide variety of tree-based algorithms for learning and
evaluating conditional density estimates over continuous variables. These trees
can be thought of as discretizations that vary according to the particular
interactions being modeled; however, the density within a given leaf of the
tree need not be assumed constant, and we show that such nonuniform leaf
densities lead to more accurate density estimation. We have developed Bayesian
network structure-learning algorithms that employ these tree-based conditional
density representations, and we show that they can be used to practically learn
complex joint probability models over dozens of continuous variables from
thousands of datapoints. We focus on finding models that are simultaneously
accurate, fast to learn, and fast to evaluate once they are learned.

principled way. Our evaluation scheme quantitatively measures how useful the
cluster labels of the patterns are as predictors of their class labels. In
cases where all clusterings to be compared have the same number of clusters,
the measure is equivalent to the mutual information between the cluster labels
and the class labels. In cases where the numbers of clusters are different,
however, it computes the reduction in the number of bits that would be required
to encode (compress) the class labels if both the encoder and decoder have free

conditional probabilities of the class labels given the cluster labels must
also be encoded. These estimated probabilities can be seen as a model for the

Bayesianism is given. It does not require infinite atomless uncertainties as
did Savage s classical result, AND can therefore be applied TO ANY finite
Bayesian network.It neither requires linear utility AS did de Finetti s
classical result, AND r ntherefore allows FOR the empirically AND normatively
desirable risk r naversion.Finally, BY identifying AND fixing utility IN an
elementary r nmanner, our result can readily be applied TO identify methods OF
r nprobability updating.Thus, a decision - theoretic foundation IS given r nto
the computationally efficient method OF inductive reasoning r ndeveloped BY
Rudolf Carnap.Finally, recent empirical findings ON r nprobability assessments
are discussed.It leads TO suggestions FOR r ncorrecting biases IN probability
assessments, AND FOR an alternative r nto the Dempster - Shafer belief
functions that avoids the reduction TO r ndegeneracy after multiple updatings.r

distinguishes moving objects from their moving cast shadows in monocular image
sequences. The models of background, edge information, and shadow are set up
and adaptively updated. A Bayesian belief network is proposed to describe the
relationships among the segmentation label, background, intensity, and edge
information. The notion of Markov random field is used to encourage the spatial
connectivity of the segmented regions. The solution is obtained by maximizing
the posterior possibility density of the segmentation field.

an algorithm for likelihood maximization in undirected graphical models. In
this paper, we present two iterative algorithms that generalize upon IPF. The
first one is for likelihood maximization in discrete chain factor graphs, which
we define as a wide class of discrete variable models including undirected
graphical models and Bayesian networks, but also chain graphs and sigmoid
belief networks. The second one is for conditional likelihood maximization in
standard undirected models and Bayesian networks. In both algorithms, the
iteration steps are expressed in closed form. Numerical simulations show that
the algorithms are competitive with state of the art methods.

  Artificial Intelligence (UAI2002)",,,"UAI-P-2002-PG-568-576","cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We select policies for large Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with compact
first-order representations. We find policies that generalize well as the
number of objects in the domain grows, potentially without bound. Existing
dynamic-programming approaches based on flat, propositional, or first-order
representations either are impractical here or do not naturally scale as the
number of objects grows without bound. We implement and evaluate an alternative
approach that induces first-order policies using training data constructed by
solving small problem instances using PGraphplan (Blum & Langford, 1999). Our
policies are represented as ensembles of decision lists, using a taxonomic
concept language. This approach extends the work of Martin and Geffner (2000)
to stochastic domains, ensemble learning, and a wider variety of problems.
Empirically, we find ""good"" policies for several stochastic first-order MDPs
that are beyond the scope of previous approaches. We also discuss the
application of this work to the relational reinforcement-learning problem.
