protection of extended states against disorder. A prominent example is the
presence of topologically protected extended-states in two-dimensional (2D)
quantum Hall systems as well as on the surface of three-dimensional (3D)
topological insulators. Distinct from such cases, here we introduce a new
concept, that is, the topological protection of bound states against
hybridization. This situation is shown to be realizable in a 2D quantum Hall
insulator put on a 3D trivial insulator. In such a configuration, there exist
topologically protected bound states, localized along the normal direction of
2D plane, in spite of hybridization with the continuum of extended states. The
one-dimensional edge states are also localized along the same direction as long
as their energies are within the band gap. This finding demonstrates the dual
role of topological invariants, as they can also protect bound states against
hybridization in a continuum.

on a hierarchical graphical statistical model on shapes within a population.The
framework represents individual shapes as point setsmodulo translation,
rotation, and scale, following the notion in Kendall shape space.While
individual shapes are derived from their group shape model, each group shape
model is derived from a single population shape model. The hierarchical model
follows the natural organization of population data and the top level in the
hierarchy provides a common frame of reference for multigroup shape analysis,
e.g. classification and hypothesis testing. Unlike typical shape-modeling
approaches, the proposed model is a generative model that defines a joint
distribution of object-boundary data and the shape-model variables.
Furthermore, it naturally enforces optimal correspondences during the process
of model fitting and thereby subsumes the so-called correspondence problem. The
proposed inference scheme employs an expectation maximization (EM) algorithm
that treats the individual and group shape variables as hidden random variables
and integrates them out before estimating the parameters (population mean and
variance and the group variances). The underpinning of the EM algorithm is the
sampling of pointsets, in Kendall shape space, from their posterior
distribution, for which we exploit a highly-efficient scheme based on
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation. Experiments in this paper use the fitted
hierarchical model to perform (1) hypothesis testing for comparison between
pairs of groups using permutation testing and (2) classification for image
retrieval. The paper validates the proposed framework on simulated data and
demonstrates results on real data.

is the spatial spread of the entangled state and c is the speed of light. In
this way, the conflict is solved by changing QM minimally. Under general
assumptions, it is obtained a mathematical model of the process that reproduces
the QM value after a time longer than L/c has elapsed. One of the predictions
of this model is that oscillations of the rate of coincidences should exist,
with a main frequency lower than c/4L. An experiment able to reveal these
oscillations is shown to be accessible, by placing stations at about 5 Km and
reaching a coincidence rate about 3E5 1/s (a value already obtained at the

present a new theoretical method for calculating the e-capture rate in
conditions typical of evolved stars. We show how our approach compares with
state-of-the-art techniques for solar conditions, where various estimates are

electronic density at the nucleus, to which the e-capture rate for 7Be is
proportional, for different theoretical approaches including the Thomas--Fermi,
Poisson--Boltzmann and Debye--Hueckel (DH) models of screening, ii) a new
computation, based on a formalism that goes beyond the previous ones, adopting
a mean-field ""adiabatic"" approximation to the scattering process. The results
obtained with our approach as well as with the traditional ones and their
differences are discussed in some detail, starting from solar conditions, where
our method and the DH model converge to the same solution. We then analyze the
applicability of the various models to a rather broad range of T and rho
values, embracing those typical of red giant stars. We find that, over a wide
region of the parameter space explored, the DH approximation does not stand,
and the more general method we suggest is preferable. We then briefly reanalyze
the 7Li abundances in RGB and AGB stars of the Galactic Disk using the new
Be-decay rate. We also underline that the different values of the electron
density at the nucleus we find should induce effects on electron screening (for
p-captures on Li itself, as well as for other nuclei) so that our new approach
might have wide astrophysical consequences.

are derived from the mechanical energy which takes into account the
contributions due to internal moments (bending and twist), external forces and

interactive access to semi-analytical equilibrium branches, in contrast with
the individual solution points obtained from classical minimization or

particular, [20.6]Omega=2, v'=4 <- X3Delta1,v""=0 transition at 485nm was used
for the detection. The hyperfine structure and the Omega-doublet of the
transition are measured, which are essential for estimating the size of the
potential systematic uncertainties for electron EDM measurement. For further
suppression of the systematic uncertainty, an alternative electron EDM
measurement scheme utilizing the g factor crossing point of the Omega-doublet

uncertainty of the electron EDM experiment. With the given results, the

by dark matter annihilation or decay, similar diffuse radio halos should exist
around other galaxies with physical properties comparable to the Milky Way. If
instead the haze is due to an astrophysical mechanism peculiar to the Milky Way
or to a transient event, a similar halo need not exist around all Milky Way
""twins"". We use radio observations of 66 spiral galaxies to test the dark
matter origin of the haze. We select galaxies based on morphological type and
maximal rotational velocity, and obtain their luminosities from a 1.49 GHz
catalog and additional radio observations at other frequencies. We find many
instances of galaxies with radio emission that is less than 5% as bright as
naively expected from dark matter models that could produce the Milky Way haze,
and at least 3 galaxies that are less than 1% as bright as expected, assuming
dark matter distributions, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray propagation
parameters equal to those of the Milky Way. For reasonable ranges for the
variation of these parameters, we estimate the fraction of galaxies that should
be expected to be significantly less bright in radio, and argue that this is
marginally compatible with the observed distribution. While our findings
therefore cannot rule out a dark matter origin for the radio haze at this time,
we find numerous examples (including the Andromeda Galaxy) where, if dark
matter is indeed the origin of the Milky Way haze, some mechanism must be in
place to suppress the corresponding haze of the external galaxy. We point out
that Planck data will offer opportunities to improve this type of constraint in
a highly relevant frequency range and for a potentially larger set of candidate
galaxies.

collisions of microswimmers in a viscous fluid. We consider two self-propelled
spheres (microswimmers) moving towards each other in viscous fluid. We first
show that under commonly used no-slip boundary conditions on the fluid-solid
interface the microswimmers do not collide which is a generalization of the
well-known no-collision paradox for solid bodies (with no self-propulsion) in a
viscous fluid. Secondly, we show that the microswimmers do collide when the
no-slip boundary conditions are replaced by the Navier boundary conditions
which therefore provides an adequate model of microswimmers such as swimming
bacteria. The self-propulsion mechanism generates a drag force pulling a
bacterium backwards and the collision problem is reduced to the analysis of
competition between the drag and self-propulsion. For no-slip this is done by
utilizing the Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem and the analytical solution for two
solid spheres in the fluid. The analysis for the Navier boundary conditions is
based on the variational formulation of Stokes problem. A Poincare type

Nor does it require drying the leaves. The concept involves the in situ
determination of K using geometrical shapes and their weights obtained from a
subset of fresh leaves of the set whose areas are desired. Subsequently the
LAs, at any desired stratification level, are derived by utilizing K and the
previously measured masses of the fresh leaves. The concept was first tested in
the simulated ideal case of complete planarity and uniform thickness by using
plastic film covered card-paper sheets. Next the species-specific
conservativeness of K over individual leaf zones and different leaf types from
leaves of plants from two species, Mandevilla splendens and Spathiphyllum
wallisii, was quantitatively validated. Using the global average K values, the
LA of these and additional plants, were obtained. LAMM was found to be a rapid,
simple, economic technique with accuracies, as measured for the geometrical
shapes, that were comparable to those obtained by the planimetric method that
utilizes digital image analysis, DIA. For the leaves themselves, there were no

This indicates the force exerted by the radiation from the disc indeed helps

penetration depth, the granular velocity profile around the cylinder is found
stationary with fluctuations around a mean value leading to the granular

  In order to know the value of $\beta$, we constrain NGR model with latest
observations including type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from Union2 set (557 data),
baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) observation from the spectroscopic Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data release 7 (DR7) galaxy sample and cosmic
microwave background (CMB) observation from the 7-year Wilkinson Microwave
Anisotropy Probe (WMAP7) results. With Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method,
the constraint result is
$\beta$=$0.08_{-0.21}^{+0.30}(1\sigma)_{-0.28}^{+0.43}(2\sigma)$, which
manifests the observations prefer a XCDM universe rather than RDE model. It
seems RDE model is ruled out in NGR scenario within $2\sigma$ regions.
Furthermore, we compare it with some of successful cosmological models using
AIC information criterion. NGR model seems to be a good choice for describing
the universe.

combinatorics and theoretical computer science for proving that random
functions are near their means. Of particular importance is the case where f(X)
is a function of independent random variables X=(X_1, ..., X_n). Here the well
known bounded differences inequality (also called McDiarmid's or
Hoeffding-Azuma inequality) establishes sharp concentration if the function f
does not depend too much on any of the variables. One attractive feature is
that it relies on a very simple Lipschitz condition (L): it suffices to show
that |f(X)-f(X')| \leq c_k whenever X,X' differ only in X_k. While this is easy
to check, the main disadvantage is that it considers worst-case changes c_k,
which often makes the resulting bounds too weak to be useful.
  In this paper we prove a variant of the bounded differences inequality which
can be used to establish concentration of functions f(X) where (i) the typical
changes are small although (ii) the worst case changes might be very large. One
key aspect of this inequality is that it relies on a simple condition that (a)
is easy to check and (b) coincides with heuristic considerations why
concentration should hold. Indeed, given an event \Gamma that holds with very
high probability, we essentially relax the Lipschitz condition (L) to
situations where \Gamma occurs. The point is that the resulting typical changes
c_k are often much smaller than the worst case ones.
  To illustrate its application we consider the reverse H-free process, where H
is 2-balanced. We prove that the final number of edges in this process is
concentrated, and also determine its likely value up to constant factors. This
answers a question of Bollob\'as and Erd\H{o}s.

secured by covering them into a computer carrier file without damaging the file
or changing its size. The difference between steganography and cryptography is
that steganography is a stealthy method of communication that only the
communicating parties are aware of; while, cryptography is an overt method of
communication that anyone is aware of, despite its payload is scribbled.
Typically, an irrecoverable steganography algorithm is the algorithm that makes
it hard for malicious third parties to discover how it works and how to recover
the secret data out of the carrier file. One popular way to achieve
irrecoverability is to digitally process the carrier file after hiding the
secret data into it. However, such process is irreversible as it would destroy
the concealed data. This paper proposes a new image steganography method for
textual data, as well as for any form of digital data, based on adjusting the
brightness of the carrier image after covering the secret data into it. The
algorithm used is parameterized as it can be configured using three different
parameters defined by the communicating parties. They include the amount of
brightness to apply on the carrier image after the completion of the covering
process, the color channels whose brightness should be adjusted, and the bytes
that should carry in the secret data. The novelty of the proposed method is
that it embeds bits of the secret data into the three LSBs of the bytes that
compose the carrier image in such a way that does not destroy the secret data
when restoring back the original brightness of the carrier image. The
simulation conducted proved that the proposed algorithm is valid and correct.

reversibility as well as the conservation of the discrete charge, energy and
linear momentum. Those methods are the Crank-Nicolson (CN) schemes, the
linearized CN schemes, the odd-even hopscotch scheme, the leapfrog scheme, a
semi-implicit finite difference scheme, and the exponential operator splitting
(OS) schemes. The nonlinear subproblems resulted from the OS schemes are
analytically solved by fully exploiting the local conservation laws of the NLD
equation. The effectiveness of the various numerical methods, with special
focus on the error growth and the computational cost, is illustrated on two
numerical experiments, compared to two high-order accurate Runge-Kutta
discontinuous Galerkin methods. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that
the high-order accurate OS schemes may compete well with other numerical
schemes discussed here in terms of the accuracy and the efficiency. A
fourth-order accurate OS scheme is further applied to investigating the
interaction dynamics of the NLD solitary waves under the scalar and vector
self-interaction. The results show that the interaction dynamics of two NLD
solitary waves depend on the exponent power of the self-interaction in the NLD
equation; collapse happens after collision of two equal one-humped NLD solitary
waves under the cubic vector self-interaction in contrast to no collapse
scattering for corresponding quadric case.

wormhole physics. Thus, cosmic phantom energy may, in principle, provide a
natural fluid to support wormholes. In this work, we find new asymptotically
flat wormhole solutions supported by the phantom energy equation of state,
consequently extending previous solutions. Thus, there is no need to surgically
paste the interior wormhole geometry to an exterior vacuum spacetime. In the
first example, we carefully construct a specific shape function, where the
energy density and pressures vanish at large distances as $\sim 1/r^{n}$, with
$n>0$. We also consider the ""volume integral quantifier"", which provides useful
information regarding the total amount of energy condition violating matter,

wormhole solutions with an arbitrary small amount of energy condition violating
matter. In the second example, we analyse two equations of state, i.e.,
$p_r=p_r(\rho)$ and $p_t=p_t(\rho)$, where we consider a specific integrability
condition in order to obtain exact asymptotically flat wormhole solutions. In

no one can suspect its existence. Unlike cryptography which may arouse
suspicions, steganography is a stealthy method that enables data communication
in total secrecy. Steganography has many requirements, the foremost one is
irrecoverability which refers to how hard it is for someone apart from the
original communicating parties to detect and recover the hidden data out of the
secret communication. A good strategy to guaranteeirrecoverability is to cover
the secret data not usinga trivial method based on a predictable algorithm, but
using a specific random pattern based on a mathematical algorithm. This paper
proposes an image steganography technique based on theCanny edge detection
algorithm.It is designed to hide secret data into a digital image within the
pixels that make up the boundaries of objects detected in the image. More
specifically, bits of the secret data replace the three LSBs of every color
channel of the pixels detected by the Canny edge detection algorithm as part of
the edges in the carrier image. Besides, the algorithm is parameterized by
three parameters: The size of the Gaussian filter, a low threshold value, and a
high threshold value. These parameters can yield to different outputs for the
same input image and secret data. As a result, discovering the inner-workings
of the algorithm would be considerably ambiguous, misguiding steganalysts from
the exact location of the covert data. Experiments showed a simulation tool
codenamed GhostBit, meant to cover and uncover secret data using the proposed
algorithm. As future work, examining how other image processing techniques such
as brightness and contrast adjustment can be taken advantage of in

without invoking anomalously high accretion rates or the creation of exotically
massive seeds, neither of which is seen in the local Universe. Recent
observations have compounded this problem by demonstrating that most, if not
all, of the high-z quasars appear to be accreting at the Eddington limit. In
the context of LCDM, the only viable alternative now appears to be the
assemblage of supermassive black holes via mergers, as long as the seeds
started forming at redshifts >40, but ceased being created by z~20-30. In this
paper, we show that, whereas the high-z quasars may be difficult to explain
within the framework of the standard model, they can instead be interpreted
much more sensibly in the context of the R_h=ct Universe. In this cosmology,
5-20 solar-mass seeds produced after the onset of re-ionization (at z<15) could
have easily grown to M>10^9 solar masses by z> 6, merely by accreting at the
standard Eddington rate.

(AME) in the light of ongoing or future observations to be performed with the
largest fully steerable radio telescope in the world. High angular resolution
observations of the AME will enable astronomers to drastically improve the
knowledge of the AME mechanisms as well as the interplay between the different
constituents of the interstellar medium in our galaxy. Extragalactic
observations of the AME have started as well, and high resolution is even more
important in this kind of observations. When cross-correlating with IR-dust
emission, high angular resolution is also of fundamental importance in order to
obtain unbiased results. The choice of the observational frequency is also of
key importance in continuum observation. We calculate a merit function that
accounts for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in AME observation given the
current state-of-the-art knowledge and technology. We also include in our merit
functions the frequency dependence in the case of multifrequency observations.
We briefly mention and compare the performance of four of the largest
radiotelescopes in the world and hope the observational programs in each of
them will be as intense as possible.
