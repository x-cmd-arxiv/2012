then tested their functions in yeast. We showed that these factors can be
regulated by doxycycline and degraded rapidly after addition of auxin to the
medium. Taken together, the method for combinatorial gene assembly described
here is versatile and would be a valuable tool for yeast synthetic biology.

the ABJM coupling k, which corresponds to the strong coupling expansion of the
type IIA string. This allows us to study membrane instanton corrections in
M-theory at high order in the WKB expansion. Using these WKB results, we verify
the conjectures for the form of the one-instanton correction at finite k
proposed recently by Hatsuda, Moriyama and Okuyama (HMO), which are in turn
based on a conjectural cancellation of divergences between worldsheet
instantons and membrane instantons. The HMO cancellation mechanism is important
since it shows in a precise, quantitative way, that the perturbative genus
expansion is radically insufficient at strong coupling, and that
non-perturbative membrane effects are essential to make sense of the theory. We
propose analytic expressions in k for the full two-membrane instanton
correction and for higher-order non-perturbative terms, which pass many
consistency checks and provide further evidence for the HMO mechanism.

(approximately) achieves a desired input vector of values for the
Shapley-Shubik indices. Despite much interest in this problem no provably
correct and efficient algorithm was known prior to our work.
  We give the first efficient algorithm with provable performance guarantees
for the Inverse Shapley Value Problem. For any constant $\eps > 0$ our
algorithm runs in fixed poly$(n)$ time (the degree of the polynomial is
independent of $\eps$) and has the following performance guarantee: given as
input a vector of desired Shapley values, if any ""reasonable"" weighted voting
scheme (roughly, one in which the threshold is not too skewed) approximately
matches the desired vector of values to within some small error, then our
algorithm explicitly outputs a weighted voting scheme that achieves this vector
of Shapley values to within error $\eps.$ If there is a ""reasonable"" voting
scheme in which all voting weights are integers at most $\poly(n)$ that
approximately achieves the desired Shapley values, then our algorithm runs in
time $\poly(n)$ and outputs a weighted voting scheme that achieves the target
vector of Shapley values to within error $\eps=n^{-1/8}.$

provided by four 'fiber coupler' units located in the GRAVITY cryostat. Each

possibility of on-axis as well as off-axis fringe tracking without changing the
optical path. Finally the stabilized beam is injected with minimized losses
into single-mode fibers via parabolic mirrors. We present lab results of the

there exists a rich choice of entropies for fitting needs. This diversity of
entropies gave rise to a Maxent ""anarchism"". Maxent approach is now the
conditional maximization of an appropriate entropy for the evaluation of the
probability distribution when our information is partial and incomplete. The
rich choice of non-classical entropies causes a new problem: which entropy is
better for a given class of applications? We understand entropy as a measure of
uncertainty which increases in Markov processes. In this work, we describe the
most general ordering of the distribution space, with respect to which all
continuous-time Markov processes are monotonic (the Markov order). For
inference, this approach results in a set of conditionally ""most random""
distributions. Each distribution from this set is a maximizer of its own
entropy. This ""uncertainty of uncertainty"" is unavoidable in analysis of
non-equilibrium systems. Surprisingly, the constructive description of this set
of maximizers is possible. Two decomposition theorems for Markov processes
provide a tool for this description.

superfluid atomic Fermi gas close to the unitarity limit. We show that the
experimental values of the shear viscosity coefficient to entropy ratio,
$\eta/s$, obtained at the lowest reached temperature can be reproduced assuming
that phonons give the leading contribution to $\eta$. The phonon contribution
is evaluated considering $1 \leftrightarrow 2$ processes and taking into
account the finite size of the experimental system. In particular, for very low
temperatures, $T \lesssim 0.1 T_F$, we find that phonons are ballistic and the
contribution of phonons to the shear viscosity is determined by the processes
that take place at the interface between the superfluid and the normal phase.
This result is independent of the detailed form of the phonon dispersion law
and leads to two testable predictions: the shear viscosity should correlate
with the size of the optical trap and it should decrease with decreasing
temperature. For higher temperatures the detailed form of the phonon dispersion
law becomes relevant and, within our model, we find that the experimental data
for $\eta/s$ can be reproduced assuming that phonons have an anomalous
dispersion law.

attributed to the peculiar velocities of individual galaxies. Although most
galaxies also have uncertainties in their distances, when galaxies with
accurate distances are used recent studies have found that these supposed
peculiar velocities may have preferred, or discrete, values. Here we report the
interesting result that when these discrete components are identified and
removed from the radial velocities of the SNeIa galaxies studied in the Hubble
Key Project, there is evidence for a residual oscillation, or ripple,
superimposed on the Hubble flow. This oscillation has a wavelength near 40 Mpc
and, because its amplitude is small compared to that of the scatter in
velocities, it becomes visible only after the discrete components are removed.
This result is interesting because even if this ripple has been produced by a
selection effect, the fact that it is only revealed after the discrete
velocities are removed implies that the discrete velocities are real.
Alternatively, if no selection effect can be identified to explain the ripple,
then both the discrete velocities and the ripple together become very difficult
to explain by chance and these results could then have interesting cosmological
consequences.

diverging energy density of the RR and NS-NS three-form fluxes. There are many
hopes and arguments for and against this singularity, and we attempt to settle
the issue by examining whether this singularity can be cloaked by a regular
event horizon. This is equivalent to the existence of asymptotically
Klebanov-Tseytlin or Klebanov-Strassler black holes whose charge measured at
the horizon has the opposite sign to the asymptotic charge. We find that no
such KT solution exists. Furthermore, for a large class of KS black holes we
considered, the charge at the horizon must also have the same sign as the
asymptotic charge, and is completely determined by the temperature, the number
of fractional branes and the gaugino masses of the dual gauge theory. Our
result suggests that antibrane singularities in backgrounds with charge in the
fluxes are unphysical, which in turn raises the question as to whether
antibranes can be used to uplift AdS vacua to deSitter ones. Our results also
point out to a possible instability mechanism for the antibranes.

this idea by fitting rotation curves of seventeen low surface brightness

parameters do not perform a suitable fit to the rotation curves in comparison

nanocrystals. Our experiments show that the commonly observed large spread in
fluorescence decay rates of NV centers in nanodiamond is inconsistent with the
common explanation of large nanophotonic mode-density variations in the
ultra-small high-index crystals at near-unity quantum efficiency. We report
that NV centers in 25 nm nanocrystals are essentially insensitive to local
density of states (LDOS) variations that we induce at a dielectric interface by
using liquids to vary the refractive index, and propose that quantum
efficiencies in such nanocrystals are widely distributed between 0% and 20%.

changes can be reversibly induced by nanomechanically approaching a mirror to
change the LDOS. Using this scanning mirror method, for the first time we
report calibrated quantum efficiencies of NV centers, and show that different

the manifest supersymmetry present in the formalism, and the limited number of
interaction terms in the action. Furthermore, we investigate the conditions set
by this description in order for amplitudes in maximal supergravity to be
finite in the ultraviolet limit. Typically, there is an upper limit to the
dimension, set by the loop order, which for an arbitrary number of loops is no
larger than two. In four dimensions, the non-renormalisation power of the
formalism fails for the 7-loop contribution to the 4-point amplitude, all of
which is in clear agreement with previous work.

limited the adoption of lasers in imaging and display applications. We use
colloidal solutions that can quickly reduce speckle contrast due to the
Brownian motion of the scattering particles. The high insertion loss associated
with propagation through a colloidal solution was overcome by using white paint
to cover the sides of the cuvette and an optical fiber to deliver the laser
light deep into the colloidal solution, enabling transmission greater than 90%.
The diffused laser output followed a Lambertian distribution and produced
speckle contrast below 4% at an integration time of 129 {\mu}s. The ability for
colloidal solutions to achieve fast speckle reduction without power consumption
while maintaining high transmission, low cost, a compact size, and a long
lifetime, makes our approach useful for a wide range of laser imaging and
projection applications.

model, in which the error distribution allows heteroscedasticity and belongs to
the family of scale mixture of the skewnormal (SMSN) distributions, thus
eliminating the need to transform the dependent variable into many data sets.
The SMSN is a tractable and flexible class of asymmetric heavy-tailed
distributions that are useful for robust inference when the normality
assumption for error distribution is questionable. Two well-known important
members of this class are the proper skew-normal and skew-t distributions. In
this work emphasis is given to the skew-t model. However, the proposed
methodology can be adapted for each of the SMSN models with some basic changes.
The present work is motivated by previous analysis about of Cardinalfish age,
in which a maximum age of 15 years has been determined. Therefore, in this
study we carry out the mentioned methodology over a data set that include a
long-range of ages based on an otolith sample where the determined longevity is
higher than 54 years.

in wireless communication systems due to its high data rate transmission
capability with high bandwidth efficiency and its robustness to multi-path

receiver. To cancel the effect of fading, channel estimation and equalization
procedure must be done at the receiver before data demodulation. This paper
mainly deals with pilot based channel estimation techniques for OFDM
communication over frequency selective fading channels. This paper proposes a
specific approach to channel equalization for Orthogonal Frequency Division
Multiplex (OFDM) systems. Inserting an equalizer realized as an adaptive system
before the FFT processing, the influence of variable delay and multi path could
be mitigated in order to remove or reduce considerably the guard interval and
to gain some spectral efficiency. The adaptive algorithm is based on adaptive
filtering with averaging (AFA) for parameter update. Based on the development
of a model of the OFDM system, through extensive computer simulations, we
investigate the performance of the channel equalized system. The results show
much higher convergence and adaptation rate compared to one of the most
frequently used algorithms - Least Mean Squares (LMS).

perturbatively small. Depending on the parameters, this model can give a

random comparison codes when a small tolerance to error is introduced. On the
other hand, RF codes are good at reflecting distances between represented
stimuli, while the random comparison codes are not. We suggest that a

specifically take care that constraints imposed by chiral symmetry breaking and
by the heavy quark limit are fulfilled. The main results are: i) the wave
functions of light mesons have a nontrivial dependence on the current quark
mass, which gives rise to a mass spectrum consistent with the one including
explicit breaking of chiral symmetry; ii) the wave functions of heavy-light
mesons generate their correct mass spectrum, the mass splittings of vector and
pseudoscalar states, and the correct scaling of leptonic decay constants f(Q
\bar q) \sim 1/sqrt(mQ); iii) the wave functions of heavy quarkonia produce
their correct mass spectrum and lead to a scaling behaviour of the leptonic
decay constants f(Q \bar Q) \sim sqrt(mQ) and f(c \bar b) \sim mc/sqrt(mb) at
mc << mb, consistent with potential models and QCD sum rules.

pseudorapidity (Delta-eta) are measured in sqrt(s_NN) = 5.02 TeV p+Pb
collisions using the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The measurements are performed
using approximately 1 mub^-1 of data as a function of p_T and the transverse
energy (SumE_T) summed over 3.1 < eta < 4.9 in the direction of the Pb beam.
The correlation function, constructed from charged particles, exhibits a
long-range (2<|Delta-eta|<5) near-side (Delta-phi ~ 0) correlation that grows
rapidly with increasing SumE_T. A long-range away-side (Delta-phi ~ pi)
correlation, obtained by subtracting the expected contributions from recoiling
dijets and other sources estimated using events with small SumE_T, is found to
match the near-side correlation in magnitude, shape (in Delta-eta and
Delta-phi) and SumE_T dependence. The resultant Delta-phi correlation is
approximately symmetric about pi/2, and is consistent with a cos(2Delta-phi)
modulation for all SumE_T ranges and particle p_T. The amplitude of this
modulation is comparable in magnitude and p_T dependence to similar modulations
observed in heavy-ion collisions, suggestive of final-state collective effects
in high multiplicity events.

of the classical Brinkman equation for homogenized porous flow, we demonstrate
using two different methods that such cloaked flows can be dynamically stable
for $Re$ in the range 5-119. The first, highly efficient, method is based on a
linearization of the Brinkman-Navier-Stokes equation and finding the
eigenfrequencies of the least stable eigen-perturbations; the second method is
a direct, numerical integration in the time domain. We show that, by
suppressing the Karman vortex street in the weekly turbulent wake, porous flow
cloaks can raise the critical Reynolds number up to about 120, or five times
greater than for a bare, uncloaked cylinder.

links between entities with information on two or more files. RL is an
important activity in areas including counting the population, enhancing survey
frames and data, and conducting epidemiological and follow-up studies. RL is
challenging when files are very large, no accurate personal identification (ID)
number is present on all files for all units, and some information is recorded
with error. Without an unique ID number one must rely on comparisons of names,
addresses, dates, and other information to find the links. Latent class models
can be used to automatically score the value of information for determining
match status. Data for fitting models come from comparisons made within groups
of units that pass initial file blocking requirements. Data distributions can
vary across blocks. This article examines the use of prior information and
hierarchical latent class models in the context of RL.

Such a feature
is useful when the cause of a bug is close in time to the bug manifestation.
When the cause is far back in time, one resorts to setting appropriate
breakpoints in the debugger and beginning a new debugging session. For these
cases when the cause of a bug is far in time from its manifestation, bug
diagnosis requires a series of debugging sessions with which to narrow down the
cause of the bug.
  For such ""difficult"" bugs, this work presents an automated tool to search
through the process lifetime and locate the cause. As an example, the bug could
be related to a program invariant failing. A binary search through the process
lifetime suffices, since the invariant expression is true at the beginning of
the program execution, and false when the bug is encountered. An algorithm for
such a binary search is presented within the FReD (Fast Reversible Debugger)
software. It is based on the ability to checkpoint, restart and
deterministically replay the multiple processes of a debugging session. It is
based on GDB (a debugger), DMTCP (for checkpoint-restart), and a custom
deterministic record-replay plugin for DMTCP.
  FReD supports complex, real-world multithreaded programs, such as MySQL and
Firefox. Further, the binary search is robust. It operates on multi-threaded
programs, and takes advantage of multi-core architectures during replay.

blazar OJ 287 while invoking the presence of a precessing binary black hole in
the system to explain the nature of these flares. Precursor flare timings from
the historical light curves are compared with theoretical predictions from our
model that incorporate effects of an accretion disk and post-Newtonian
description for the binary black hole orbit. We find that the precursor flares
coincide with the secondary black hole descending towards the accretion disk of
the primary black hole from the observed side, with a mean z-component of
approximately z_c = 4000 AU. We use this model of precursor flares to predict
that precursor flare of similar nature should happen around 2020.96 before the
next major outburst in 2022.

expanders. This approach is based on recent deep results in combinatorial group
theory. It applies to both regular and irregular random graphs.
  Let G be a random d-regular graph on n vertices, and let \lambda be the
largest absolute value of a non-trivial eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. It
was conjectured by Alon [86'] that a random d-regular graph is almost
Ramanujan, in the following sense: for every e>0, \lambda<2\sqrt{d-1} + e
asymptotically almost surely. Friedman famously presented a proof of this
conjecture in [08']. Here we suggest a new, substantially simpler proof of a
nearly-optimal result: we show that a random d-regular graph satisfies \lambda
< 2\sqrt{d-1} + 1 a.a.s.
  A main advantage of our approach is that it is applicable to a generalized
conjecture: For d even, a d-regular graph on n vertices is an n-covering space
of a bouquet of d/2 loops. More generally, fixing an arbitrary base graph H, we
study the spectrum of G, a random n-covering of H. Let \lambda be the largest
absolute value of a non-trivial eigenvalue of G. Extending Alon's conjecture to
this more general model, Friedman [03'] conjectured that for every e>0, a.a.s.
\lambda < \rho+e, where \rho is the spectral radius of the universal cover of
H. When H is regular we get a bound of \rho+0.84, and for an arbitrary H, we
prove a nearly optimal upper bound of \sqrt{3}\rho. This is a substantial
improvement upon all known results (by Friedman, Linial-Puder,
Lubetzky-Sudakov-Vu and Addario-Berry-Griffiths).

simulated annealing algorithms which are perfectly suited to be accelerated by
highly parallel architectures like GPUs. The applications support the Coulomb,

conclusions on the reliability of SP and DP simulations and suggest a mixed

to overcome the memory constraint of single GPUs. A communicator class which

improving our knowledge of early galaxy evolution and cosmic reionization. Our
analysis exploits fully the new, deepest WFC3/IR imaging from our HST UDF12
campaign, and includes a new, consistent analysis of all appropriate,
shallower/wider-area HST data. Our new measurement of the evolving LF at z ~
7-8 is based on a final catalogue of ~600 galaxies, and involves a step-wise
maximum likelihood determination based on the redshift probability distribution
for each object; this makes full use of the 11-band imaging now available in
the HUDF, including the new UDF12 F140W data, and the deep Spitzer IRAC
imaging. The final result is a determination of the z ~ 7 LF extending down to
M_UV = -16.75, and the z ~ 8 LF down to M_UV = -17.00. Fitting a Schechter
function, we find M* = -19.90 (+0.23/-0.28), log phi* = -2.96 (+0.18/-0.23),
and a faint-end slope alpha=-1.90 (+0.14/-0.15) at z~7, and M* = -20.12

z~8. These results strengthen suggestions that the evolution at z > 7 is more
akin to `density evolution' than the apparent `luminosity evolution' seen at z
~ 5-7. We also provide the first meaningful information on the LF at z ~ 9,
explore alternative extrapolations to higher z, and consider the implications
for the evolution of UV luminosity density. Finally, we provide catalogues
(including z_phot, M_UV and all photometry) for the 100 most robust z~6.5-11.9

high contrast. Anatomical ULF MRI has been successfully implemented with
SQUIDs, but SQUIDs have the drawback of cryogen requirement. Atomic
magnetometers have sensitivity comparable to SQUIDs and can be in principle
used for ULF MRI to replace SQUIDs. Unfortunately some problems exist due to
the sensitivity of atomic magnetometers to magnetic field and gradients. At low
frequency, noise is also substantial and a shielded room is needed for
improving sensitivity. In this paper, we show that at 85 kHz, the atomic
magnetometer can be used to obtain anatomical images. This is the first
demonstration of any use of atomic magnetometers for anatomical MRI. The
demonstrated resolution is 1.1x1.4 mm2 in about six minutes of acquisition with
SNR of 10. Some applications of the method are discussed. With several measures
it is also possible to increase sensitivity to reach resolution 1x1 mm2, which
is typical in medical imaging.

types of signals are analyzed in detail. The WMAP mission has resulted in a
highly constrained LCDM cosmological model with precise and accurate parameters
in agreement with a host of other cosmological measurements. When WMAP data are
combined with finer scale CMB, baryon acoustic oscillation, and Hubble constant
measurements, we find that Big Bang nucleosynthesis is well supported and there
is no compelling evidence for a non-standard number of neutrino species
(3.84+/-0.40). The model fit also implies that the age of the universe is
13.772+/-0.059 Gyr, and the fit Hubble constant is H0 = 69.32+/-0.80 km/s/Mpc.
Inflation is also supported: the fluctuations are adiabatic, with Gaussian
random phases; the detection of a deviation of the scalar spectral index from
unity reported earlier by WMAP now has high statistical significance (n_s =
0.9608+/-0.0080); and the universe is close to flat/Euclidean, Omega_k =
-0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038). Overall, the WMAP mission has resulted in a
reduction of the cosmological parameter volume by a factor of 68,000 for the
standard six-parameter LCDM model, based on CMB data alone. For a model
including tensors, the allowed seven-parameter volume has been reduced by a
factor 117,000. Other cosmological observations are in accord with the CMB
predictions, and the combined data reduces the cosmological parameter volume
even further. With no significant anomalies and an adequate goodness-of-fit,
the inflationary flat LCDM model and its precise and accurate parameters rooted
in WMAP data stands as the standard model of cosmology.

WMAP data, in conjunction with additional cosmological data sets. The WMAP data
alone, and in combination, continue to be remarkably well fit by a
six-parameter LCDM model. When WMAP data are combined with measurements of the
high-l CMB anisotropy, the BAO scale, and the Hubble constant, the densities,
Omegabh2, Omegach2, and Omega_L, are each determined to a precision of ~1.5%.
The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3%, and there is
now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level,
confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year WMAP data. At the
end of the WMAP mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of
the six-dimensional LCDM parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to
pre-WMAP measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show
that their LCDM parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from
the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution
of tensor modes is limited to r<0.13 (95% CL); the spatial curvature parameter
is limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is <0.44
eV (95% CL); and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.84+/-0.40
when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on Neff and the
primordial helium abundance agrees with the prediction of standard Big Bang
nucleosynthesis. We compare recent PLANCK measurements of the
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their
mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature
extrema is updated. This confirms a fundamental prediction of the standard
cosmological model and provides a striking illustration of acoustic
oscillations and adiabatic initial conditions in the early universe.

several alternative symmetries that appear in models that provide a DM
particle. To this end, we devise a strategy to determine whether a heavy mother
particle decays into one visible massless particle and one or two DM particles.
The counting of DM particles in these decays is relevant to distinguish the
minimal choice of Z_2, from a Z_3, stabilization symmetry, under which the
heavy particle and the DM are charged and the visible particle is not. Our
method is novel in that it chiefly uses the peak of the energy spectrum of the
visible particle and only secondarily uses the M_T2 endpoint of events in which
the heavy mother particles are pair-produced. We present new theoretical
results concerning the energy distribution of the decay products of a
three-body decay, which are crucial for our method. To demonstrate the
feasibility of our method in investigating the stabilization symmetry, we apply
it in distinguishing the decay of a bottom quark partner into a b quark and one

renormalized space-like geodesic lengths and rectangular minimal area surfaces
as extended probes of thermalization, which are dual to two-point functions and

conformal matter, which can be compared with the collapse of an AdS-Vaidya thin
shell. Remarkably, for conformal matter, the thermalization time scale becomes
much larger than the others. Furthermore, in each case we also investigate
models where the cosmological constants of the inner and outer regions
separated by the shell are different. We found that in this case only a scalar
field shell collapses, and that the thermalization time scale is also much
larger than the AdS-Vaidya case.

this unrealistic assumption and show that any dN/dS value can in principle be
achieved at a site, without epistasis. Furthermore, for all nuclear and

the scale-invariant NMSSM, whose renormalizable superpotential contains no

can easily accommodate a 126 GeV Higgs. We study the naturalness of the

increasing the (lightest) stop mass beyond 1.2 TeV, the gluino mass above 3

which the latest results from the LHC and Tevatron constrain the couplings of
the Higgs boson-like state at ~ 125 GeV. To this end we assume that only
Standard Model (SM) particles appear in the Higgs decays, but tree-level Higgs
couplings to the up-quarks, down-quarks and vector bosons, relative to the SM
are free parameters. We also assume that the leptonic couplings relative to the
SM are the same as for the down-quark, and a custodial symmetry for the V=W,Z
couplings. In the simplest approach, the effective Higgs couplings to gluons
and photons are computed in terms of the previous parameters. This approach is
also applied to Two-Higgs-Doublet Models of Type I and Type II. However, we
also explore the possibility that the net Higgs to gluon-gluon and gamma-gamma
couplings have extra loop contributions coming from Beyond-the-Standard Model
physics. We find that the SM p-value ~ 0.5 is more than 2 sigma away from fits
in which: a) there is some non-SM contribution to the gamma-gamma coupling of
the Higgs; or b) the sign of the top quark coupling to the Higgs is opposite
that of the W coupling. In both these cases p-values ~ 0.9 can be achieved.
Since option b) is difficult to realize in realistic models, it would seem that
new physics contributions to the effective couplings of the Higgs are
preferred.

emerge as the right handed chiral half of the space-time connection, which
explains the chirality of the weak interaction. This is possible, because, as
shown by Plebanski, Ashtekar, and others, the other chiral half of the
space-time connection is enough to code the dynamics of the gravitational
degrees of freedom.
  This unification is achieved within an extension of the Plebanski action
previously proposed by one of us. The theory has two phases. A parity symmetric
phase yields, as shown by Speziale, a bi-metric theory with eight degrees of
freedom: the massless graviton, a massive spin two field and a scalar ghost.
Because of the latter this phase is unstable. Parity is broken in a stable
phase where the eight degrees of freedom arrange themselves as the massless
graviton coupled to an SU(2) triplet of chirally coupled Yang-Mills fields. It
is also shown that under this breaking a Dirac fermion expresses itself as a
chiral neutrino paired with a scalar field with the quantum numbers of the

continuous tower of massive scalar fields which can drive the current phase of
accelerated expansion of the universe and, in addition, can contribute as a
dark matter component. The tower consists of a continuous set of massive scalar
fields with a gaussian mass distribution. We show that, in a certain region of
the parameter space, the {\it heavy} modes of the tower (those with masses much
larger than the Hubble expansion rate) dominate at early times and make the
tower behave like the usual single scalar field whose coherent oscillations
around the minimum of the potential give a matter-like contribution. On the
other hand, at late times, the {\it light} modes (those with masses much
smaller than the Hubble expansion rate) overcome the energy density of the
tower and they behave like a perfect fluid with equation of state ranging from
0 to -1, depending on the spectral index of the initial spectrum. This is a
distinctive feature of the tower with respect to the case of quintessence
fields, since a massive scalar field can only give acceleration with equation
of state close to -1. Such unique property is the result of a synergy effect
between the different mass modes. Interestingly, we find that, for some choices
of the spectral index, the tower tracks the matter component at high redshifts
(or it can even play the role of the dark matter) and eventually becomes the
dominant component of the universe and give rise to an accelerated expansion.

white dwarfs (WD) by intermediate mass black holes (IMBH). The smaller size of
an IMBH compared to a supermassive black hole and a smaller tidal radius of a
WD disruption lead to a very fast event with high peak luminosity. Magnetic
field is generated in situ following the tidal disruption, which leads to
effective accretion. Since large-scale magnetic field is also produced,
geometrically thick super-Eddington inflow leads to a relativistic jet. The
dense jet possesses a photosphere, which emits quasi-thermal radiation in soft
X-rays. The source can be classified as a long low-luminosity gamma-ray burst
(ll-GRB). Tidal compression of a WD causes nuclear ignition, which is
observable as an accompanying supernova. We suggest that GRB060218 and SN2006aj
is such a pair of ll-GRB and supernova. We argue that in a flux-limited sample
the disruptions of WDs by IMBHs are more frequent then the disruptions of other

power of integral-field spectroscopy (IFS) in detecting and measuring the [O
III]{\lambda}5007 emission of PNe against a strong stellar background, we turn
to the very nuclear PN population of M31, within 80 pc of its centre. We show
that PNe can also be found in the presence of emission from diffuse gas and
further illustrate the excellent sensitivity of IFS in detecting extragalactic
PNe through a comparison with narrowband images obtained with the Hubble Space
Telescope. We find the nuclear PNe population of M31 is only marginally
consistent with the generally adopted form of the PNe luminosity function
(PNLF). In particular, this is due to a lack of PNe with absolute magnitude
M5007 brighter than -3, which would only result from a rather unfortunate draw
from such a model PNLF. We suggest that the observed lack of bright PNe in the
nuclear regions of M31 is due to a horizontal-branch population that is more
tilted toward less massive and hotter He-burning stars, so that its progeny
consists mostly of UV-bright stars that fail to climb back up the asymptotic
giant branch (AGB) and only of few, if any, bright PNe powered by central
post-AGB stars. These results are also consistent with recent reports on a
dearth of bright post-AGB stars towards the nucleus of M31, and lend further
support to the idea that the metallicity of a stellar population has an impact
on the way the horizontal branch is populated and to the loose anticorrelation
between the strength of the UV-upturn and the specific number of PNe that is
observed in early-type galaxies. Finally, our investigation also serves to
stress the importance of considering the same spatial scales when comparing the
PNe population of galaxies with the properties of their stellar populations.

the source of the hard ionizing continuum that powers the HeII emission. We
have assembled a sample of 277 galaxies with a high quality spectroscopic
redshift at 2<z<4.6 from the VVDS survey, and we have identified 39 HeII1640A
emitters. We study their spectral properties, measuring the fluxes, equivalent
widths (EW) and FWHM for most relevant lines. About 10% of galaxies at z~3 show
HeII in emission, with rest frame equivalent widths EW0~1-7A, equally
distributed between galaxies with Lya in emission or in absorption. We find 11
high-quality HeII emitters with unresolved HeII line (FWHM_0<1200km/s), 13
high-quality emitters with broad He II emission (FWHM_0>1200km/s), 3 AGN, and
an additional 12 possible HeII emitters. The properties of the individual broad
emitters are in agreement with expectations from a W-R model. On the contrary,
the properties of the narrow emitters are not compatible with such model,
neither with predictions of gravitational cooling radiation produced by gas
accretion. Rather, we find that the EW of the narrow HeII line emitters are in
agreement with expectations for a PopIII star formation, if the episode of star
formation is continuous, and we calculate that a PopIII SFR of 0.1-10 Mo yr-1
only is enough to sustain the observed HeII flux. We conclude that narrow HeII
emitters are either powered by the ionizing flux from a stellar population rare
at z~0 but much more common at z~3, or by PopIII star formation. As proposed by
Tornatore et al. (2007), incomplete ISM mixing may leave some small pockets of
pristine gas at the periphery of galaxies from which PopIII may form, even down
to z~2 or lower. If this interpretation is correct, we measure at z~3 a SFRD in
PopIII stars of 10^6Mo yr^-1 Mpc^-3 qualitatively comparable to the value
predicted by Tornatore et al. (2007).

involving comparison of clustering properties of point processes. Our approach
is founded on some basic observations allowing us to consider void
probabilities and moment measures as two complementary tools for capturing
clustering phenomena in point processes. As might be expected, smaller values
of these characteristics indicate less clustering. Also, various global and
local functionals of random geometric models driven by point processes admit
more or less explicit bounds involving void probabilities and moment measures,
thus aiding the study of impact of clustering of the underlying point process.
When stronger tools are needed, directional convex ordering of point processes
happens to be an appropriate choice, as well as the notion of (positive or
negative) association, when comparison to the Poisson point process is
considered. We explain the relations between these tools and provide examples
of point processes admitting them. Furthermore, we sketch some recent results
obtained using the aforementioned comparison tools, regarding percolation and
coverage properties of the Boolean model, the SINR model, subgraph counts in
random geometric graphs, and more generally, U-statistics of point processes.

coupled only via their shared gravitational field, which is computed
consistently from the density profiles. Assuming conservation of mass, momentum
and angular momentum, perturbation analyses reveal the galaxy's response to
radial disturbance. The modes depend on fundamental dark matter properties, the
stellar mass, and the halo's mass and radius. The coupling of stars and dark
matter stabilises some haloes that would be unstable as one-fluid models.
However the centrally densest haloes are unstable, causing radial flows of SIDM
and stars (sometimes in opposite directions). Depending on the dark
microphysics, some highly diffuse haloes are also unstable. Unstable galaxies
might shed their outskirts or collapse. Observed elliptical galaxies appear to
exist in the safe domain. Halo pulsations are possible. The innermost node of
SIDM waves may occur within ten half-light radii. Induced stellar ripples may
also occur at detectable radii if higher overtones are excited. If any SIDM
exists, observational skotoseismology of galaxies could probe DM physics,
measure the sizes of specific systems, and perhaps help explain peculiar
objects (e.g. some shell galaxies, and the growth of red nuggets).

the mixture, and has (stick-breaking) mixture weights that are
covariate-dependent. Thus, the novel model allows the rating category
thresholds to vary flexibly across items and examinees, and allows the
distribution of the category thresholds to vary flexibly as a function of
covariates. We illustrate the new model through the analysis of a simulated
data set, and through the analysis of a real rating data set that is well-known
in the psychometric literature. The model is shown to have better
predictive-fit performance, compared to other commonly used IRT rating models.

in the center of the Sun, 2) a thin ring current sheet with the azimuthal
current density j_{\varphi} ~ r^{-3} near the equatorial plane and 3) a
magnetic quadrupole in the center of the Sun. The model reproduces, in an
asymptotically correct manner, the known geometry of the field lines during the

given a model that forms a Lie algebra, we apply existing Lie theory to gain
additional insight into the geometry of the associated Markov matrices. In this
short note, we present the simplest case possible of 2x2 Markov matrices. The
main result is a novel decomposition of 2x2 Markov matrices that parameterises
the general Markov model as a perturbation away from the binary-symmetric

the binary-symmetric model as a submodel of the general Markov model.

however, the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward. These
methods use both cell-averaged values and nodal values as dependent variables

they are combined with method of lines for integration in time. This framework

naturally. This paper focuses on the accuracy and linear stability of the

distribution in a rotating thin-disk galaxy from given rotation curve by
applying Newtonian dynamics for an axisymmetrically rotating thin disk of
finite size with or without a central spherical bulge. The governing integral
equation for mass distribution, resulting from the balance between the
Newtonian gravitational force and centrifugal force due to rotation at every
point on the disk, is transformed via a boundary-element method into a linear
algebra matrix equation that can be solved numerically for rotation curves with
a wide range of shapes. To illustrate the effectiveness of this computational
method, mass distributions in several mature spiral galaxies are determined
from their measured rotation curves. All the surface mass density profiles
predicted by our model exhibit approximately a common exponential law of decay,
qualitatively consistent with the observed surface brightness distributions.
When a central spherical bulge is present, the total galactic mass increases
only slightly but the mass distribution in the galaxy is altered in such a way
that the periphery mass density is reduced while more mass appears toward the
galactic center. By extending the computational domain beyond the galactic
edge, we can determine rotation velocity outside the cut-off radius which
appears to continuously decrease and gradually approach the Keplerian rotation
velocity out over twice the cut-off radius. Am examination of the circular
orbit stability suggests that galaxies with flat or increasing rotation
velocities with radius are more stable than those with decreasing rotation
velocities especially in the region near the galactic edge. Our results
demonstrate the fact that Newtonian dynamics can be adequate for describing the
observed rotation behavior of mature spiral galaxies.

covariance matrix $\Sigma_n$ over the class of $p\times p$ population
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ of reduced effective rank $r_e(\Sigma)$. This
class includes scaled factor models and covariance matrices with decaying
spectrum. We consider $r_e(\Sigma)$ as a measure of matrix complexity, and
obtain sharp minimax rates on the operator and Frobenius norm of
$\Sigma_n-\Sigma$, as a function of $r_e(\Sigma)$ and $\|\Sigma\|_2$, the
operator norm of $\Sigma$. With guidelines offered by the optimal rates, we
define classes of matrices of reduced effective rank over which $\Sigma_n$ is
an accurate estimator. Within the framework of these classes, we perform a
detailed finite sample theoretical analysis of the merits and limitations of
the empirical scree plot procedure routinely used in PCA. We show that
identifying jumps in the empirical spectrum that consistently estimate jumps in
the spectrum of $\Sigma$ is not necessarily informative for other goals, for
instance for the selection of those sample eigenvalues and eigenvectors that
are consistent estimates of their population counterparts. The scree plot
method can still be used for selecting consistent eigenvalues, for appropriate
threshold levels. We provide a threshold construction and also give a rule for
checking the consistency of the corresponding sample eigenvectors. We
specialize these results and analysis to population covariance matrices with
polynomially decaying spectra, and extend it to covariance operators with
polynomially decaying spectra. An application to fPCA illustrates how our
results can be used in functional data analysis.

for Gromov-Witten invariants of noncommutative resolutions, as defined by e.g.
Kontsevich, and use those predictions to examine the connectivity of the SCFT
moduli space. Noncommutative spaces, in the present sense, are defined by their
sheaves, their B-branes. Examples of abstract CFT's whose B-branes correspond
with those defining noncommutative spaces arose in examples of abelian GLSMs
describing branched double covers, in which the double cover structure arises
nonperturbatively. This note will examine the GLSM for P^7[2,2,2,2], which
realizes this phenomenon. Its Landau-Ginzburg point is a noncommutative
resolution of a (singular) branched double cover of P^3. Regardless of the
complex structure of the large-radius P^7[2,2,2,2], the Landau-Ginzburg point
is always a noncommutative resolution of a singular space, which begs the
question of whether the noncommutative resolution is connected in SCFT moduli
space by a complex structure deformation to a smooth branched double cover.
Using recent localization techniques, we make a prediction for the
Gromov-Witten invariants of the noncommutative resolution, and find that they
do not match those of a smooth branched double cover, telling us that these
abstract CFT's are not continuously connected to sigma models on smooth
branched double covers.

simply ""notions"" or ""concepts"" without actual calculation derived from fluid or
disk physics. Future progress requires a combination of numerical simulations
and semi-analytic studies to extract physical insights. We review recent works
on global oscillation modes in black-hole accretion disks, and explain how,
with the help of general relativistic effects, the energy stored in the disk
differential rotation can be pumped into global spiral density modes in the
disk, making these modes grow to large amplitudes under certain conditions
(""corotational instability""). These modes are robust in the presence of disk
magnetic fields and turbulence. The computed oscillation mode frequencies are
largely consistent with the observed values for HFQPOs in BH X-ray binaries.
The approximate 2:3 frequency ratio is also expected from this model. The
connection of HFQPOs with other disk properties (such as production of episodic
jets) is also discussed.

investigate that whether $\Sigma_{c}(2800)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)^{+}$ could
be explained as the $S$-wave $DN$ state with $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ and the
$S$-wave $D^{*}N$ state with $J^{P}=\frac{3}{2}^{-}$, respectively.
Technically, contributions of operators up to dimension $12$ are included in
the operator product expansion (OPE). The final results are
$3.64\pm0.33~\mbox{GeV}$ and $3.73\pm0.35~\mbox{GeV}$ for the $S$-wave $DN$

experimental data of $\Sigma_{c}(2800)$ and $\Lambda_{c}(2940)^{+}$,
respectively. In view of that corresponding molecular currents are constructed
from local operators of hadrons, the possibility of $\Sigma_c(2800)$ and
$\Lambda_{c}(2940)^{+}$ as molecular states can not be arbitrarily excluded
merely from these disagreements between molecular masses using local currents
and experimental data. But then these results imply that $\Sigma_{c}(2800)$ and
$\Lambda_{c}(2940)^{+}$ could not be compact states. This may suggest a
limitation of the QCD sum rule using the local current to determine whether
some state is a molecular state or not. As byproducts, masses for their bottom
partners are predicted to be $6.97\pm0.34~\mbox{GeV}$ for the $S$-wave
$\bar{B}N$ state of $J^{P}=\frac{1}{2}^{-}$ and $6.98\pm0.34~\mbox{GeV}$ for

also unknown, are sparse and each contributes weakly (i.e., rare and weak) to
the classification decision. By obtaining a reasonably good estimate of

two-stage classification method where we first select features by the method of
Innovated Thresholding (IT), and then use the retained features and Fisher's
LDA for classification. In this approach, a crucial problem is how to set the
threshold of IT. We approach this problem by adapting the recent innovation of
Higher Criticism Thresholding (HCT). We find that when useful features are rare
and weak, the limiting behavior of HCT is essentially just as good as the
limiting behavior of ideal threshold, the threshold one would choose if the
underlying distribution of the signals is known (if only). Somewhat
surprisingly, when $\Omega$ is sufficiently sparse, its off-diagonal

at a particular level of resonance broadening and aim to characterise how the
structure of this set changes as the level of resonance broadening is varied.
The commonly held view that resonance broadening can be thought of as a
thickening of the resonant manifold is misleading. We show that in fact the set
of modes corresponding to a single quasi-resonant triad has a nontrivial
structure and that its area in fact diverges for a finite degree of broadening.
We also study the connectivity of the network of modes which is generated when
quasi-resonant triads share common modes. This network has been argued to form
the backbone for energy transfer in Rossby wave turbulence. We show that this
network undergoes a percolation transition when the level of resonance
broadening exceeds a critical value. Below this critical value, the largest
connected component of the quasi-resonant network contains a negligible
fraction of the total number of modes in the system whereas above this critical
value a finite fraction of the total number of modes in the system are
contained in the largest connected component. We argue that this percolation
transition should correspond to the transition to turbulence in the system.

stripe-antiferromagnetic phase in the frustrated two-dimensional square-lattice
Ising model with competing interactions J1<0 (nearest neighbor, ferromagnetic)
and J2 >0 (second neighbor, antiferromagnetic). The striped phase breaks a Z4
symmetry and is stabilized at low temperatures for g=J2/|J1|>1/2. Despite the
simplicity of the model, it has proved difficult to precisely determine the
order and the universality class of the phase transitions. This was done
convincingly only recently by Jin et al. [PRL 108, 045702 (2012)]. Here, we
further elucidate the nature of these transitions and their anomalies by
employing a combination of cluster mean-field theory, Monte Carlo simulations,
and transfer-matrix calculations. The J1-J2 model has a line of very weak
first-order phase transitions in the whole region 1/2<g<g*, where g* = 0.67(1).
Thereafter, the transitions from g above g* are continuous and can be fully
mapped, using universality arguments, to the critical line of the well known
Ashkin-Teller model from its 4-state Potts point to the decoupled Ising limit.
We also comment on the pseudo-first-order behavior at the Potts point and its
neighborhood in the Ashkin-Teller model on finite lattices, which in turn leads
to the appearance of similar effects in the vicinity of the multicritical point
g* in the J1-J2 model. The continuous transitions near g* can therefore be
mistaken to be first-order transitions, and this realization was the key to
understanding the paramagnetic-striped transition for the full range of g>1/2.
Most of our results are based on Monte Carlo calculations, while the cluster
mean-field and transfer-matrix results provide useful methodological
bench-marks for weakly first-order behaviors and Ashkin-Teller criticality.

Ribeiro","Augusto Cesar Lobo and Clyffe de Assis Ribeiro","Classical Structures in Quantum Mechanics and Applications","33 pages, 11 figures",,,,"quant-ph math-ph math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The theory of Non-Relativistic Quantum Mechanics was created (or discovered)
back in the 1920's mainly by Schr\""odinger and Heisenberg, but it is fair
enough to say that a more modern and unified approach to the subject was
introduced by Dirac and Jordan with their (intrinsic) Transformation Theory. In
his famous text book on quantum mechanics [1], Dirac introduced his well-known
bra and ket notation and a view that even Einstein (who was, as well known,
very critical towards the general quantum physical world-view) considered the
most elegant presentation of the theory at that time[2]. One characteristic of
this formulation is that the observables of position and momentum are truly
treated equally so that an intrinsic phase-space approach seems a natural
course to be taken. In fact, we may distinguish at least two different quantum
mechanical approaches to the structure of the quantum phase space: The
Weyl-Wigner (WW) formalism and the advent of the theory of Coherent States
(CS). The Weyl-Wigner formalism has had many applications ranging from the
discussion of the Classical/Quantum Mechanical transition and quantum chaos to
signal analysis[3,4]. The Coherent State formalism had a profound impact on
Quantum Optics and during the course of time has found applications in diverse
areas such as geometric quantization, wavelet and harmonic analysis [5]. In
this chapter we present a compact review of these formalisms (with also a more
intrinsic and coordinate independent notation) towards some non-standard and
up-to-date applications such as modular variables and weak values.

numerical methods for Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), based on the

one-component BEC of the weakly interacting bosons, we study the reduction of
GPE to lower dimensions, the ground states of BEC including the existence and
uniqueness as well as nonexistence results, and the dynamics of GPE including
dynamical laws, well-posedness of the Cauchy problem as well as the finite time
blow-up. To compute the ground state, the gradient flow with discrete
normalization (or imaginary time) method is reviewed and various full
discretization methods are presented and compared. To simulate the dynamics,
both finite difference methods and time splitting spectral methods are
reviewed, and their error estimates are briefly outlined. When the GPE has
symmetric properties, we show how to simplify the numerical methods. Then we
compare two widely used scalings, i.e. physical scaling (commonly used) and
semiclassical scaling, for BEC in strong repulsive interaction regime
(Thomas-Fermi regime), and discuss semiclassical limits of the GPE. Extensions
of these results for one-component BEC are then carried out for rotating BEC by
GPE with an angular momentum rotation, dipolar BEC by GPE with long range
dipole-dipole interaction, and two-component BEC by coupled GPEs. Finally, as a
perspective, we show briefly the mathematical models for spin-1 BEC, Bogoliubov
excitation and BEC at finite temperature.

functions are well known. In this paper we extract a novel observable, the
transparency ratio, Tp(A)/T_p(12C), for knockout of high-missing-momentum
protons from the breakup of short range correlated pairs (2N-SRC) in Al, Fe and
Pb nuclei relative to C. The ratios were measured at momentum transfer Q^2 >

electron scattering from 2N-SRC. The transparency ratios of the knocked-out
protons coming from 2N-SRC breakup are 20 - 30% lower than those of previous
results for low missing momentum. They agree with Glauber calculations and
agree with renormalization of the previously published transparencies as
proposed by recent theoretical investigations. The new transparencies scale as
A^-1/3, which is consistent with dominance of scattering from nucleons at the

have unbounded amplitude and contain cavitation regions in which the mass
density vanishes. In the present paper, we are interested in dispersive shock
waves and analyze the zero viscosity-capillarity limit associated with the
Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system. Specifically, we establish the existence of
finite energy solutions as well as their convergence toward entropy solutions
to the Euler system. We encompass a broad class of nonlinear
Navier-Stokes-Korteweg constitutive laws, which is determined by two main
conditions relating the viscosity and capillarity coefficients, that is, on one
hand the strong coercivity condition (as we call it) which provides a favorable
sign for the integrated dissipation associated with an effective energy, and on
the other hand the tame capillarity condition (as we call it), which restricts
pointwise the strength of the capillarity relatively to the viscosity. Rather
mild conditions on the growth of the constitutive functions are aso imposed,
which are required in order to define finite energy weak solutions to the
Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system, even in the presence of cavitation. Our method
of proof relies on fine algebraic properties of the Euler system and combines
together energy and effective energy estimates, dissipation and effective
dissipation estimates, a nonlinear Sobolev inequality, high-integrability
properties for the mass density and for the velocity, and compactness
properties based on entropies.

model in the presence of strong magnetic fields and most recent versions of the
theoretical and experimental nuclear mass tables. Next we deal with nuclei in
the inner crust. Nuclei which are arranged in a lattice, are immersed in a
nucleonic gas as well as a uniform background of electrons in the inner crust.
The Wigner-Seitz approximation is adopted in this calculation and each lattice
volume is replaced by a spherical cell. The coexistence of two phases of
nuclear matter - liquid and gas, is considered in this case. We obtain the
equilibrium nucleus corresponding to each baryon density by minimizing the free
energy of the cell. We perform this calculation using Skyrme nucleon-nucleon
interaction with different parameter sets. We find nuclei with larger mass and
charge numbers in the inner crust in the presence of strong magnetic fields
than those of the zero field case for all nucleon-nucleon interactions
considered here. However, SLy4 interaction has dramatic effects on the proton
fraction as well as masses and charges of nuclei. This may be attributed to the
behaviour of symmetry energy with density in the sub-saturation density regime.
Further we discuss the implications of our results to shear mode oscillations
of magnetars.

functions of the Kob-Andersen Lennard-Jones binary mixture and of its purely
repulsive, Weeks-Chandler-Andersen variant. In the glassy regime, the two
models possess a similar pair structure, yet their dynamics differ markedly.
The static triplet correlation functions S^(3) indicate that the local ordering
is more pronounced in the Lennard-Jones model, an observation consistent with
its slower dynamics. A comparison of the direct triplet correlation functions
c^(3) reveals that these structural differences are due, to a good extent, to
an amplification of the small discrepancies observed at the pair level. We
demonstrate the existence of a broad, positive peak at small wave-vectors and
angles in c^(3). In this portion of k-space, slight, systematic differences
between the models are observed, revealing ""genuine"" three-body contributions
to the triplet structure. The possible role of the low-k features of c^(3) and
the implications of our results for dynamic theories of the glass transition
are discussed.

essential to study the MIR emission of AGN. We have compiled all the T-ReCS
spectra (Gemini observatory) available in the N-band for 22 AGN: 5 Type-1 and
17 Type-2 AGN. The high angular resolution of the T-ReCs spectra allows us to
probe physical regions of 57 pc (median). We have used a novel pipeline called
RedCan capable of producing flux- and wavelength-calibrated spectra for the
CanariCam (GTC) and T-ReCS (Gemini) instruments. We have measured the
fine-structure [SIV] at 10.5 microns and the PAH at 11.3 microns line strengths
together with the silicate absorption/emission features. We have also compiled
Spitzer/IRS spectra to understand how spatial resolution influences the
results. The 11.3 microns PAH feature is only clearly detected in the nuclear
spectra of two AGN, while it is more common in the Spitzer data. For those two
objects the AGN emission in NGC7130 accounts for more than 80% of the MIR
continuum at 12 microns while in the case of NGC1808 the AGN is not dominating
the MIR emission. This is confirmed by the correlation between the MIR and

believed to originate in the narrow line region, is detected in most AGN. We

produced by bulk-motion Comptonization in the radiative shock near the bottom
of the accretion column. This radiation escapes as a fan beam, which is partly
absorbed by the polar cap photosphere, heating it up to relatively high
temperatures. The scattered component and the thermal emission from the polar
cap form a polar beam. We test our model on the well-studied AXP 4U 0142+61,
whose energy-dependent pulse profiles show double peaks, which we ascribe to
the fan and polar beams. The temperature of the photosphere (kT~0.4 keV) is
explained by the heating effect. The scattered part forms a hard component in
the polar beam. We suggest that the observed high temperatures of the polar
caps of AXPs/SGRs, compared with other young neutron stars, are due to the
heating by the fan beam. Using beaming functions for the fan beam and the polar
beam and taking gravitational bending into account, we fit the energy-dependent
pulse profiles and obtain the inclination angle and the angle between the spin

and give a revised classification of its nucleus as a hydrogen-deficient star
of type [WN4]. The surrounding nebula has a morphology typical of PNe and
importantly, is not enriched in nitrogen, and thus not the 'peeled atmosphere'
of a massive star. Indeed, no WN4 star is known to be surrounded by such a
compact nebula. The ionized mass of the nebula is also a powerful discriminant
between the low-mass PN and high-mass WR ejecta interpretations. The ionized
mass would be impossibly high if a distance corresponding to a Pop I star was
adopted, but at a distance of 2 kpc, the mass is quite typical of moderately
evolved PNe. At this distance, the ionizing star then has a luminosity of ~5000
Lsolar, again rather typical for a PN central star. We give a brief discussion
of the implications of this discovery for the late-stage evolution of
intermediate-mass stars.

the bacterial population B. subtilis and determine some early signatures of the
regime shifts between competence and noncompetence. We use both deterministic

studied include the critical slowing down as a transition point is approached,
rising variance and the lag-1 autocorrelation function, skewness and a ratio of
two mean first passage times. Some of the signatures could provide the
experimental basis for distinguishing between bistability and excitability as
the correct mechanism for the development of competence.

(2012). This process models the stochastic evolution of the genealogies and
(allelic) types under resampling, mutation and selection in the population
currently alive in the limit of infinitely large populations. Genealogies and
types are described by (isometry classes of) marked metric measure spaces. The
long-time limit of the neutral tree-valued Fleming-Viot dynamics is an
equilibrium given via the marked metric measure space associated with the
Kingman coalescent. In the present paper we pursue two closely linked goals.
First, we show that two well-known properties of the neutral Fleming-Viot
genealogies at fixed time $t$ arising from the properties of the dual, namely
the Kingman coalescent, hold for the whole path. These properties are related
to the geometry of the family tree close to its leaves. In particular we
consider the number and the size of subfamilies whose individuals are not
further than $\ve$ apart in the limit $\ve\to 0$. Second, we answer two open
questions about the sample paths of the tree-valued Fleming-Viot process. We
show that for all $t>0$ almost surely the marked metric measure space $\mathcal
X_t$ has no atoms and admits a mark function. The latter property means that
all individuals in the tree-valued Fleming-Viot process can uniquely be
assigned a type. All main results are proven for the neutral case and then
carried over to selective cases via Girsanov's formula giving absolute
continuity.

boundary conditions. The ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density
\eta(T)/s(T) from PHSD shows a minimum (with a value of about 0.1) close to the
critical temperature T_c, while it approaches the perturbative QCD limit at
higher temperatures in line with lattice QCD (lQCD) results. For T<T_c, i.e.,
in the hadronic phase, the ratio \eta/s rises fast with decreasing temperature
due to a strong decrease of the entropy density $s$ in the hadronic phase at
decreasing T. Within statistics, we obtain practically the same results in the
Kubo formalism and in the relaxation time approximation. The bulk viscosity
\zeta(T)---evaluated in the relaxation time approach---is found to strongly
depend on the effects of mean fields (or potentials) in the partonic phase. We
find a significant rise of the ratio \zeta(T)/s(T) in the vicinity of the
critical temperature T_c, when consistently including the scalar mean-field
from PHSD, which is also in agreement with that from lQCD calculations.
Furthermore, we present the results for the ratio (\eta+ 3\zeta/4)/s, which is
found to depend nontrivially on temperature and to generally agree with the
lQCD calculations as well. Within the PHSD calculations, the strong maximum of
\zeta(T)/\eta(T) close to T_c has to be attributed to mean-field (or potential)
effects that in PHSD are encoded in the temperature dependence of the
quasiparticle masses, which is related to the infrared enhancement of the

we investigate how to apply relaying to improve the short-term performance of
EH communication systems. With an EH source and a non-EH half-duplex relay, we
consider two different design objectives: 1) short-term throughput
maximization; and 2) transmission completion time minimization. Both problems
are joint scheduling and power allocation problems, rendered quite challenging
by the half-duplex constraint at the relay. A key finding is that directional
water-filling (DWF), which is the optimal power allocation algorithm for the
single-hop EH system, can serve as guideline for the design of two-hop
communication systems, as it not only determines the value of the optimal
performance, but also forms the basis to derive optimal solutions for both
design problems. Based on a relaxed energy profile along with the DWF
algorithm, we derive key properties of the optimal solutions for both problems
and thereafter propose efficient algorithms. Simulation results will show that
both scheduling and power allocation optimizations are necessary in two-hop EH

sigma <1. For sigma <0 the behavior is essentially of mean field type, but for

nodes in wireless networks is to avail the ambient radio-frequency (RF) signal
and to simultaneously harvest energy and process information. In this paper, an
amplify-and-forward (AF) relaying network is considered, where an energy
constrained relay node harvests energy from the received RF signal and uses
that harvested energy to forward the source information to the destination.
Based on the time switching and power splitting receiver architectures, two
relaying protocols, namely, i) time switching-based relaying (TSR) protocol and
ii) power splitting-based relaying (PSR) protocol are proposed to enable energy
harvesting and information processing at the relay. In order to determine the
throughput, analytical expressions for the outage probability and the ergodic
capacity are derived for delay-limited and delay-tolerant transmission modes,
respectively. The numerical analysis provides practical insights into the
effect of various system parameters, such as energy harvesting time, power
splitting ratio, source transmission rate, source to relay distance, noise
power, and energy harvesting efficiency, on the performance of wireless energy
harvesting and information processing using AF relay nodes. In particular, the
TSR protocol outperforms the PSR protocol in terms of throughput at relatively
low signal-to-noise-ratios and high transmission rate.

Here, we demonstrate the effect of Landau quantization of electrons on the
ground state properties of matter in outer and inner crusts in magnetars. This
effect leads to the enhancement of the electron number density in strong
magnetic fields with respect to the zero field case. For the outer crust, we
adopt the magnetic Baym-Pethick-Sutherland model and obtain the sequence of
nuclei and equation of state (EoS). The properties of nuclei in the inner crust
in the presence of strong magnetic fields are investigated using the
Thomas-Fermi model. The coexistence of two phases of nuclear matter - liquid
and gas, is assumed in this case. The proton number density in the Wigner-Seitz
cell is affected in strong magnetic fields through the charge neutrality. We
perform this calculation using the Skyrme nucleon-nucleon interaction with
different parameterisations. We find nuclei with larger mass and atomic numbers
in the inner crust in the presence of strong magnetic fields than those of the
zero field case for all those parameter sets. Further we investigate torsional
shear mode frequencies using the results of magnetised neutron star crusts and
compare those with observations.

branching ratios and CP-violating asymmetries of $B \to K\etap$ decays in the
ordinary $\eta$-$\etar$, the $\eta$-$\etar$-$G$, and the
$\eta$-$\etar$-$G$-$\eta_c$ mixing schemes. Besides the full LO contributions,
all currently known NLO contributions to $B \to K \etap$ decays in the pQCD
approach are taken into account. From our calculations and phenomenological
analysis, we find the following. (a) The NLO contributions in general can
provide significant enhancements to the LO pQCD predictions for the decay rates
of the two $B \to K \etar$ decays, around $70%-89%$ in magnitude, but result in
relatively small changes to $Br(B \to K \eta)$. (b) Although the NLO pQCD
predictions in all three considered mixing schemes agree well with the data
within one standard deviation, those pQCD predictions in the $\eta$-$\etar$-$G$
mixing scheme provide the best interpretation for the measured pattern of $Br(B
\to K \etap)$: $Br(B^0 \to K^0 \eta) \approx 1.13\times 10^{-6}$, $Br(B^0 \to
K^0 \etar) \approx 66.5 \times 10^{-6}$, $Br(B^\pm \to K^\pm \eta) \approx
2.36\times 10^{-6}$, and $Br(B^\pm \to K^\pm \etar) \approx 67.3 \times
10^{-6}$, which agree perfectly with the measured values. (c) The NLO pQCD
predictions for the CP-violating asymmetries for the four considered decays are
also in good consistent with the data. (d) The newly known NLO contribution to
the relevant form factors $\calm_{FF}$ can produce about a 20% enhancement to
the branching ratios $Br(B \to K \etar)$, which plays an important role in
closing the gap between the pQCD predictions and the relevant data. (e) The
general expectations about the relative strength of the LO and NLO
contributions from different sources are examined and confirmed by explicit
numerical calculations.

these problems arise because mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the
complex numbers, is more difficult than expected: for example the complex
function log is not continuous, writing down a program to compute an inverse
function is more complicated than just solving an equation, and many algebraic
simplification rules are not universally valid.
  The good news is that these problems are theoretically capable of being
solved, and are practically close to being solved, but not yet solved, in
several real-world examples. However, there is still a long way to go before

Moreover, by primary production, death and sinking, they transport carbon from
the ocean's surface layer to marine sediments. There are many species of
phytoplankton that can be distinguished according to morphology.
  In this paper, we investigate the generalised Truscott-Brindley model of the
dynamics of zoologically defined interacting populations which have spatial
structure. Specifically, we consider conjointly marine phytoplankton and
zooplankton populations, and model them as an excitable medium. The resolution
using the Boubaker polynomials expansion scheme (BPES) along with stability
analysis is carried out.

why many loads, called sensitive or critical loads, require a supply that is
protected. Many manufacturers of sensitive equipment specify very strict

Association for computer equipment against distribution system disturbances.
The design of this uninterrupted power supply (UPS) for personal computer (PC)
is necessitated due to a need for enhanced portability in the design of
personal computer desktop workstations. Apart from its original functionality
as a backup source of power, this design incorporates the unit within the
system unit casing, thereby reducing the number of system components available.
Also, the embedding of this unit removes the untidiness of connecting wires and
makes the whole computer act like a laptop. Not to be left out is the choice of
a microcontroller as an important part of the circuitry. This has eliminated
the weight and space-consuming components that make up an original design. The
singular use of this microcontroller places the UPS under the class of an
advanced technology device.

explicit; it is reformulated with commonly used plate notations; laminate
equations of motion are fully detailed; the place of this model relatively to

significant contributor to genetic variability of prokaryotes, and was perhaps
even more abundant during early evolution. Hitherto, research of natural HGT
has mainly focused on three mechanisms: conjugation, natural competence, and
viral transduction. This paper discusses the feasibility of a fourth such
mechanism - cell electroporation and/or electrofusion triggered by atmospheric
electrostatic discharges (lightnings). A description of electroporation as a
phenomenon is followed by a review of experimental evidence that
electroporation of prokaryotes in aqueous environments can result in release of
non-denatured DNA, as well as uptake of DNA from the surroundings and
transformation. Similarly, a description of electrofusion is followed by a
review of experiments showing that prokaryotes devoid of cell wall can
electrofuse into hybrids expressing the genes of their both precursors. Under
sufficiently fine-tuned conditions, electroporation and electrofusion are
efficient tools for artificial transformation and hybridization, respectively,
but the quantitative analysis developed here shows that conditions for
electroporation-based DNA release, DNA uptake and transformation, as well as
for electrofusion are also present in many natural aqueous environments exposed
to lightnings. Electroporation is thus a plausible contributor to natural HGT
among prokaryotes, and could have been particularly important during the early
evolution, when the other mechanisms might have been scarcer or nonexistent. In
modern prokaryotes, natural absence of the cell wall is rare, but it is
reasonable to assume that the wall has formed during evolution, and at least
prior to this, electrofusion could also have contributed to HGT. The concluding
section outlines several guidelines for assessment of the feasibility of
lightning-triggered HGT.

hemihyperplasia (asymmetric development of normally symmetric body parts in a

paradigmatic shift in our understanding of evolutionary processes that goes

cars for the purpose of safety. As opposed to the anti collision devices
present in the market today, this system is not designed to control the
vehicle. Instead, it serves as an alert in the face of imminent collision. The
device is intended to find a way to implement a minimum spacing for cars in
traffic in an affordable way. It would also achieve safety for the passengers
of a moving car. The device is made up of an infrared transmitter and receiver.
Also incorporated into it is an audio visual alarm to work in with the receiver
and effectively alert the driver and/or the passengers. To achieve this design,
555 timers coupled both as astable and monostable circuits were used along with
a 38 KHz Square Pulse generator. The device works by sending out streams of
infrared radiation and when these rays are seen by the other equipped vehicle,
both are meant to take the necessary precaution to avert a collision. The
device would still sound an alarm even though it is not receiving infrared
beams from the oncoming vehicle. This is due to reflection of its own infrared
beams. At the end of the design and testing process, overall system was
implemented with a constructed work, tested working and perfectly functional.

integers $a_1,\dots,a_n$ a simple graph (no loops or multiple edges) such that
each vertex $v_i$ has degree $a_i.$ Given pairs of nonnegative integers
$(a_1,b_1),\dots,(a_n,b_n),$ (i) the \emph{bipartite realization problem} ask
whether there is a bipartite graph (no loops or multiple edges) such that
vectors $(a_1,...,a_n)$ and $(b_1,...,b_n)$ correspond to the lists of degrees
in the two partite sets, (ii) the \emph{digraph realization problem} is to find
a digraph (no loops or multiple arcs) such that each vertex $v_i$ has indegree
$a_i$ and outdegree $b_i.$\\ The classic literature provides characterizations
for the existence of such realizations that are strongly related to the concept
of majorization. Aigner and Triesch (1994) extended this approach to a more
general result for graphs, leading to an efficient realization algorithm and a
short and simple proof for the Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem. We extend this
approach to the bipartite realization problem and the digraph realization
problem.\\ Our main result is the connection between majorization and the
number of realizations for a degree list in all three problems. We show: if
degree list $S'$ majorizes $S$ in a certain sense, then $S$ possesses more
realizations than $S'.$ We prove that constant lists possess the largest number
of realizations for fixed $n$ and a fixed number of arcs $m$ when $n$ divides
$m.$ So-called \emph{minconvex lists} for graphs and bipartite graphs or
\emph{opposed minconvex lists} for digraphs maximize the number of realizations
when $n$ does not divide $m$.

detectors in astronomy, the accuracy of current sources in metrology, the
cooling power of micro-refrigerators, and could break the topological
protection of Majorana qubits. In superconducting circuits for quantum
information processing, tunneling of quasiparticles across Josephson junctions
constitutes a decoherence mechanism. As relaxation and pure dephasing times of
transmon-type charge qubits now reach 100 microseconds, understanding whether
quasiparticle tunneling may already bottleneck coherence is of high interest.
We integrate recent advances in qubit readout and feedback control in circuit
quantum electrodynamics to perform the first real-time observation of
quasiparticle tunneling in a transmon qubit. We demonstrate
quasiparticle-tunneling contributions to qubit relaxation and pure dephasing in
the millisecond range. Thus, quasiparticle tunneling will not limit coherence
for at least one order of magnitude beyond the state of the art.

The number of detected HMXBs of different types is now high enough to allow us
to carry out a statistical analysis of their distribution in the Milky Way. For
the first time, we derive the distance and absorption of a sample of HMXBs
using a Spectral Energy Distribution fitting procedure, and we examine the
correlation with the distribution of Star Forming Complexes (SFCs) in the
Galaxy. We show that HMXBs are clustered with SFCs with a typical cluster size
of 0.3 +/- 0.05 kpc and a characteristic distance between clusters of 1.7 +/-
0.3 kpc. Furthermore, we present an investigation of the expected offset
between the position of spiral arms and HMXBs, allowing us to constrain age and
migration distance due to supernova kick for 13 sources. These new methods will
allow us to assess the influence of the environment on these high energy

demanding multi-objective problem for software engineers. In an attempt to
assist the software designer, interactive (i.e. human in-the-loop)
meta-heuristic search techniques such as evolutionary computing have been
applied and show promising results. Recent investigations have also shown that
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) can outperform evolutionary computing as a
potential search engine for interactive software design. With a limited
computational budget, ACO produces superior candidate design solutions in a
smaller number of iterations. Building on these findings, we propose a novel
interactive ACO (iACO) approach to assist the designer in early lifecycle
software design, in which the search is steered jointly by subjective designer
evaluation as well as machine fitness functions relating the structural
integrity and surrogate elegance of software designs. Results show that iACO is
speedy, responsive and highly effective in enabling interactive, dynamic
multi-objective search in early lifecycle software design. Study participants
rate the iACO search experience as compelling. Results of machine learning of
fitness measure weightings indicate that software design elegance does indeed
play a significant role in designer evaluation of candidate software design. We
conclude that the evenness of the number of attributes and methods among
classes (NAC) is a significant surrogate elegance measure, which in turn
suggests that this evenness of distribution, when combined with structural
integrity, is an implicit but crucial component of effective early lifecycle
software design.

Based on the classification, we analytically explain several published

phase noise in the local oscillators in the transmit and receive chain of the

Non-linear Josephson physics, observed in superfluid helium and atomic
condensates, has remained inaccessible in photonic systems due to the required
effective photon-photon interactions. We report on the observation of
non-linear Josephson oscillations of two coupled polariton condensates confined
in a photonic molecule etched in a semiconductor microcavity. By varying both
the distance between the micropillars forming the molecule and the condensate
density in each micropillar, we control the ratio of coupling to interaction
energy. At low densities we observe coherent oscillations of particles
tunnelling between the two micropillars. At high densities, interactions quench
the transfer of particles inducing the macroscopic self-trapping of the
condensate in one of the micropillars. The finite lifetime of polaritons
results in a dynamical transition from self-trapping to oscillations with pi
phase. Our results open the way to the experimental study of highly non-linear
regimes in photonic systems, such as chaos or symmetry-breaking bifurcations.

Off-states, and 2) a systematic variation in the shape of the 1.24 s pulse
profile. While there is general consensus that the flux modulation is due to
variable shading of the X-ray emitting regions on the surface of the neutron
star by the precessing accretion disk, the physical reason for the variation in
the pulse profiles has remained controversial. Following the suggestion that
free precession of the neutron star may be responsible for the variation in the
pulse profiles, we developed a physical model of strong feedback interaction
between the neutron star and the accretion disk in order to explain the
seemingly identical values for the periods of the two types of variations,
which were found to be in basic synchronization. In a deep analysis of pulse
profiles observed by several different satellites over the last three decades
we now find that the clock behind the pulse profile variations shows exactly
the same erratic behavior as the turn-on clock, even on short time scales (a
few 35 d cycles), suggesting that there may in fact be only one 35 d clock in
the system. If this is true, it raises serious questions with respect to the
idea of free precession of the neutron star, namely how the neutron star can
change its precessional period every few years by up to 2.5% and how the
feedback can be so strong, such that these changes can be transmitted to the
accretion disk on rather short time scales.

relations were derived as a function of angle $\theta$ between magnetization of
two leads. We have applied our theory to a quantum dot system with a resonant
level coupled with two ferromagnetic electrodes. It was found that for the MNM
system, the auto-correlation of spin current is enough to characterize the
fluctuation of spin current. For a system with three ferromagnetic layers,
however, both auto-correlation and cross-correlation of spin current are needed
to characterize the noise spectrum of spin current. Furthermore, the spin
transfer torque and the torque noise were studied for the MNM system. For a
quantum dot with a resonant level, the derivative of spin torque with respect
to bias voltage is proportional to $\sin\theta$ when the system is far away
from the resonance. When the system is near the resonance, the spin transfer
torque becomes non-sinusoidal function of $\theta$. The derivative of noise
spectrum of spin transfer torque with respect to the bias voltage $N_\tau$
behaves differently when the system is near or far away from the resonance.
Specifically, the differential shot noise of spin transfer torque $N_\tau$ is a
concave function of $\theta$ near the resonance while it becomes convex
function of $\theta$ far away from resonance. For certain bias voltages, the
period $N_\tau(\theta)$ becomes $\pi$ instead of $2\pi$. For small $\theta$, it
was found that the differential shot noise of spin transfer torque is very
sensitive to the bias voltage and the other system parameters.

determined metallicities from high-resolution spectroscopy. The p-relation
finally adopted is 1.50 -0.24log P. The slope of this relation is based on the
condition that the distance to the LMC does not depend on period or (V-K)
colour and that the slope of the PL relation based on the BW distances agrees
with that based on apparent magnitude. The zero point of the relation is tight
to the Cepheids with HST and revised Hipparcos parallaxes as well as to
Cepheids in clusters. The slope of the Galactic and LMC K-band relation
formally agrees within the errors, and combining all Cepheids (including the
SMC) results in a negligible metallicity dependence. A similar conclusion is
found for the reddening-free Wesenheit relation. In the V-band the situation is
more complex. The slope of the LMC and the Galactic PL relation differ at the
3sigma level. Combining the sample nevertheless results in a metallicity term
significant at the 2sigma level. The details of the comparison of BW-based
distances and Cepheids with HST and revised Hipparcos parallaxes also play a
role. The method used by Storm et al. would lead to larger DM of 18.37 and
18.81 for the LMC and SMC, respectively. The LMC DM is shorter than the
currently accepted value, which is in the range 18.42 to 18.55 (Walker 2012),
and it is speculated that the p-factor may depend on metallicity.

limited choice along with randomness in the evolution of the system. One starts
with the empty graph and at each stage two edges are chosen uniformly at
random. One of the two edges is then placed into the system according to a
decision rule based on the sizes of the components containing the four
vertices. For bounded-size rules, all components of size greater than some
fixed $K\geq 1$ are accorded the same treatment. Writing $\BS(t)$ for the state
of the system with nt/2 edges, Spencer and Wormald proved that for such rules,
there exists a critical time t_c such that when t< t_c the size of the largest
component is of order $\log{n}$ while for $t> t_c$, the size of the largest
component is of order $n$. In this work we obtain upper bounds (that hold with
high probability) of order $n^{2\gamma} \log ^4 n$, on the size of the largest
component, at time instants $t_n = t_c-n^{-\gamma}$, where $\gamma\in (0,1/4)$.
This result for the barely subcritical regime forms a key ingredient in the
study undertaken in \cite{amc-2012}, of the asymptotic dynamic behavior of the
process describing the vector of component sizes and associated complexity of
the components for such random graph models in the critical scaling window. The
proof uses a coupling of BSR processes with a certain family of inhomogeneous
random graphs with vertices in the type space $\Rbold_+\times
\cD([0,\infty):\NNN_0)$ where $\cD([0,\infty):\NNN_0)$ is the Skorohod
$D$-space of functions that are right continuous and have left limits equipped
with the usual Skorohod topology. The coupling construction also gives an
alternative characterization (than the usual explosion time of the
susceptibility function) of the critical time $t_c$ for the emergence of the
giant component in terms of the operator norm of integral operators on certain
$L^2$ spaces.

derived from the \Halpha\ luminosity for standard, log(g) = 4.0 models adopted

with the relative hardness of the SEDs. In general WM-basic and TLUSTY

effective temperatures that are cooler by a few thousand degrees. We compare

elastic foundation, (b) an elastic beam which mass is concentrated at a
discrete set of points corresponding to the discrete set of the elastic
supports and (c) a uniform elastic beam on a set of discrete elastic supports.
Stiffness of the support is assumed to drop when the stress reaches a critical
value. In the formulation, it is also assumed that, at the moment of the
support damage, the value of the `added mass', which reflects the dynamic
response of the support, is dropped too. Strong similarities in the behavior of

regimes, subsonic, intersonic and supersonic, where the failure wave is or is
not accompanied by elastic waves excited by the moving jump in the support
stiffness, are considered and related characteristic speeds are determined.

are found for the failure wave to exists, to propagate uniformly or to
accelerate. It is also found that such beam-related transition wave can
propagate steadily only at the intersonic speeds. It is remarkable that the

uniformly at random and then decides which one to add to the existing
configuration according to some criterion. An important class of such rules are
the bounded-size rules where for a fixed $K\geq 1$, all components of size
greater than $K$ are treated equally. While a great deal of work has gone into
analyzing the subcritical and supercritical regimes, the nature of the critical
scaling window, the size and complexity (deviation from trees) of the
components in the critical regime and nature of the merging dynamics has not
been well understood. In this work we study such questions for general
bounded-size rules. Our first main contribution is the construction of an
extension of Aldous's standard multiplicative coalescent process which
describes the asymptotic evolution of the vector of sizes and surplus of all

potential. As a special subcase, our black holes include the ones constructed
previously by Gibbons and Maeda in arXiv:0912.2809. The latter contain two
non-negative real numbers n_S, n_T obeying the constraint n_S+n_T=4, with the
cases n_T=4 and n_T=1 corresponding to the Kastor-Traschen and the

extract knowledge from networks. Most of them look for communities or, more
generally, clusters of vertices with homogeneous connection profiles. While the
first models focused on networks with binary edges only, extensions now allow
to deal with valued networks. Recently, new models were also introduced in
order to characterize connection patterns in networks through mixed
memberships. This work was motivated by the need of analyzing a historical
network where a partition of the vertices is given and where edges are typed. A
known partition is seen as a decomposition of a network into subgraphs that we
propose to model using a stochastic model with unknown latent clusters. Each
subgraph has its own mixing vector and sees its vertices associated to the
clusters. The vertices then connect with a probability depending on the
subgraphs only, while the types of edges are assumed to be sampled from the
latent clusters. A variational Bayes expectation-maximization algorithm is
proposed for inference as well as a model selection criterion for the
estimation of the cluster number. Experiments are carried out on simulated data
to assess the approach. The proposed methodology is then applied to an
ecclesiastical network in Merovingian Gaul. An R code, called Rambo,

tableaux. They were introduced in the context of the asymmetric exclusion
process and Askey--Wilson polynomials, however, their purely combinatorial
properties have gained considerable interest in the past few years.
  In this paper we further study combinatorial properties of staircase
tableaux. We consider a general model of staircase tableaux in which symbols
that appear in staircase tableaux may have arbitrary positive weights. Under
this general model we derive a number of results. Some of our results concern
the limiting laws for the number of appearances of symbols in a random
staircase tableaux. They generalize and subsume earlier results that were
obtained for specific values of the weights.
  One advantage of our generality is that we may let the weights approach
extreme values of zero or infinity which covers further special cases appearing
earlier in the literature. Furthermore, our generality allows us to analyze the
structure of random staircase tableaux and we obtain several results in this
direction.
  One of the tools we use are generating functions of the parameters of
interests. This leads us to a two--parameter family of polynomials and we study
this family as well. Specific values of the parameters include number of
special cases analyzed earlier in the literature. All of them are
generalizations of the classical Eulerian polynomials.
  We also briefly discuss the relation of staircase tableaux to the asymmetric
exclusion process, to other recently introduced types of tableaux, and to an
urn model studied by a number of researchers, including Philippe Flajolet.

  Structure","20 pages, 7 figs. To appear in Journal of Computational Methods in

\emph{flat} Minkowski background. Nevertheless, it describes many curved
space-times and the related physical models, starting from cosmology and black
holes to the microworld of the spinning elementary particles and the
pre-quantum structure of vacuum fluctuations. We consider here a KS model of
the Bubble Universe -- a semi-closed Universe with a rotating de Sitter (or
anti-de Sitter) space embedded in an external flat space-time. When the
solution has two horizons, it may also be interpreted as an Universe inside a
black hole. In micro-world the KS geometry yields a model of the spinning
particle consistent with gravity and describes a pre-quantum twistorial
structure of space-time with the beam-like fluctuations of metric consistent
with the beamlike fluctuations of electromagnetic vacuum. These light-like
twistor-beam excitations are consistent with gravity and generalize the known
pp-wave solutions. Following Wheeler's estimations of the density of vacuum
fluctuations we arrive at the general conclusion that Universe should be flat
and have a zero cosmological constant. It enforces us to return to an
`effective flat geometry' filled by the electromagnetic background radiation.
