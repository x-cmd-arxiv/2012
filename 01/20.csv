surface of class DIII topological insulators, and that the magnitude of this
current can be related {\it via} an Einstein argument to a Hall-like energy
flux induced by gravity. We critically examine this idea, and argue that the
gravitational Hall effect is more complicated than its familiar analogue. A
conventional Hall current is generated by a {\it uniform} electric field, but
computing the flux from the gravitational Chern-Simons functional shows that
gravitational field {\it gradients} - i.e. tidal forces - are needed to induce
a energy-momentum flow. We relate the surface energy-momentum flux to a
domain-wall gravitational anomaly {\it via} the Callan-Harvey inflow mechanism.
We stress that the gauge invariance of the combined bulk-plus-boundary theory
ensures that the current in the domain wall always experiences a ""covariant""
rather than ""consistent"" anomaly. We use this observation to confirm that the
tidally induced energy-momentum current exactly accounts for the covariant
gravitational anomaly in $(1+1)$ dimensional domain-wall fermions. The same
anomaly arises whether we write the Chern-Simons functional in terms of the
Christofflel symbol or in terms of the the spin connection.

various degrees of asymmetric noisy channel state information (CSI). For the
case where the encoders observe causal, asymmetric noisy CSI and the decoder
observes complete CSI, we provide inner and outer bounds to the capacity
region, which are tight for the sum-rate capacity. We then observe that, under
a Markov assumption, similar capacity results also hold in the case where the
receiver observes noisy CSI. Furthermore, we provide a single letter
characterization for the capacity region when the CSI at the encoders are
asymmetric deterministic functions of the CSI at the decoder and the encoders
have non-causal noisy CSI (its causal version is recently solved in
\cite{como-yuksel}). When the encoders observe asymmetric noisy CSI with
asymmetric delays and the decoder observes complete CSI, we provide a single
letter characterization for the capacity region. Finally, we consider a
cooperative scenario with common and private messages, with asymmetric noisy
CSI at the encoders and complete CSI at the decoder. We provide a single letter
expression for the capacity region for such channels. For the cooperative
scenario, we also note that as soon as the common message encoder does not have
access to CSI, then in any noisy setup, covering the cases where no CSI or
noisy CSI at the decoder, it is possible to obtain a single letter
characterization for the capacity region. The main component in these results

However, many contractile bundles in vivo and in vitro lack sarcomeric
organization. Here we propose a model for how contractility can arise in
actomyosin bundles without sarcomeric organization and validate its predictions
with experiments on a reconstituted system. In the model, internal stresses in
frustrated arrangements of motors with diverse velocities cause filaments to
buckle, leading to overall shortening. We describe the onset of buckling in the
presence of stochastic actin-myosin detachment and predict that
buckling-induced contraction occurs in an intermediate range of motor
densities. We then calculate the size of the ""contractile units"" associated

entangled optical beams emerging from a parametric down-conversion process have
been suggested to enhance entanglement. Heralded photon addition or subtraction
is, as a matter of fact, at the heart of continuous-variable entanglement
distillation. The use of such processes has recently been experimentally
demonstrated in the context of the generation of optical coherent-state
superpositions or the verification of the canonical commutation relations.
Here, we carry out a systematic study of the effect of local photon additions
or subtractions on a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, showing that the
entanglement generally increases with the number of such operations. This is
analytically proven when additions or subtractions are restricted to one mode
only, while we observe that the highest entanglement is achieved when these
operations are equally shared between the two modes. We also note that adding
photons typically provides a stronger entanglement enhancement than subtracting
photons, while photon subtraction performs better in terms of energy
efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the interplay between entanglement and
non-Gaussianity, showing that it is more subtle than previously expected.

the capacity of the system is at least as high as for uni-directional flow, in
spite of having to empty the bottleneck at each reversal - a feature that can
be explained only by efficient transients. Looking at more sensitive quantities

producing stronger gradients across the large-scale mean magnetic field than
along it. This occurs both globally and locally, and has significant
implications in space and astrophysical plasmas, including particle scattering
and transport, and theories of turbulence. Properties of local correlation
anisotropy are further documented here by showing through numerical experiments
that the effect is intensified in more localized estimates of the mean field.
The mathematical formulation of this property shows that local anisotropy mixes
second-order with higher order correlations. Sensitivity of local statistical
estimates to higher order correlations can be understood in connection with the
stochastic coordinate system inherent in such formulations. We demonstrate this
in specific cases, illustrate the connection to higher order statistics by
showing the sensitivity of local anisotropy to phase randomization, and thus
establish that the local structure function is not a measure of the energy
spectrum. Evidently the local enhancement of correlation anisotropy is of
substantial fundamental interest, and this phenomenon must be understood in
terms of higher order correlations, fourth-order and above.

weeks in July and August 2006, the period when two exceptional flares at very
high energies (VHE, E>= 100 GeV) occurred, provide a detailed picture of the
evolution of its emission. The complete data set from this campaign is
presented, including observations in VHE gamma-rays (H.E.S.S.), X-rays (RXTE,
CHANDRA, SWIFT XRT), optical (SWIFT UVOT, Bronberg, Watcher, ROTSE), and in the
radio band (NRT, HartRAO, ATCA). Optical and radio light curves from 2004 to
2008 are compared to the available VHE data from this period, to put the 2006
campaign into the context of the long-term evolution of the source. The X-ray
and VHE gamma-ray emission are correlated during the observed high state of the
source, but show no direct connection with longer wavelengths. The long-term
flux evolution in the optical and radio bands is found to be correlated and
shows that the source reaches a high state at long wavelengths after the
occurrence of the VHE flares. Spectral hardening is seen in the SWIFT XRT data.
The nightly averaged high-energy spectra of the non-flaring nights can be
reproduced by a stationary one-zone SSC model, with only small variations in
the parameters. The spectral and flux evolution in the high-energy band during
the night of the second VHE flare is modelled with multi-zone SSC models, which
can provide relatively simple interpretations for the hour time-scale evolution
of the high-energy emission, even for such a complex data set. For the first
time in this type of source, a clear indication is found for a relation between
high activity at high energies and a long-term increase in the low frequency
fluxes.

great deal of interest from computer vision community. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for texture modeling based on partial differential
equation (PDE). Each image $f$ is decomposed into a family of derived
sub-images. $f$ is split into the $u$ component, obtained with anisotropic
diffusion, and the $v$ component which is calculated by the difference between
the original image and the $u$ component. After enhancing the texture attribute
$v$ of the image, Gabor features are computed as descriptors. We validate the
proposed approach on two texture datasets with high variability. We also
evaluate our approach on an important real-world application: leaf-texture
analysis. Experimental results indicate that our approach can be used to
produce higher classification rates and can be successfully employed for
different texture applications.

in itself, it is interesting to explicitly clarify the analogy with the

diffusion with a large-scale field experiment that randomizes exposure to
signals about friends' information sharing among 253 million subjects in situ.
Those who are exposed are significantly more likely to spread information, and
do so sooner than those who are not exposed. We further examine the relative
role of strong and weak ties in information propagation. We show that, although
stronger ties are individually more influential, it is the more abundant weak
ties who are responsible for the propagation of novel information. This
suggests that weak ties may play a more dominant role in the dissemination of

faster than light. The experiment measured the neutrino time of flight (TOF)
over a baseline from the CERN to the Gran Sasso site. The neutrino beam arrives
60 ns earlier than a light ray would do. Because the result has an enormous
impact on science, it might be worth double-checking the time definitions with
respect to the non-inertial system in which the neutrino travel time was
measured. Potential problems in the OPERA data analysis connected with the
definition of the reference frame and time synchronization are emphasized. We
aim to investigate the synchronization of non-inertial clocks on Earth by
relating this time to the proper time of an inertial observer at Solar System
Barycenter(SSB). The Tempo2 software was used to time-stamp events observed on
the geoid with respect to the SSB inertial observer time. Neutrino results from
OPERA might carry the fingerprint of non-inertial effects. The CERN-Gran Sasso
clock synchronization is accomplished by applying corrections that depend on
special and general relativistic time dilation effects at the clocks, depending
on the position of the clocks in the solar system gravitational well. As a
consequence, TOF distributions are centered on values shorter by tens of ns
than expected, integrating over a period from April to December, longer if
otherwise. It is worth remarking that the OPERA runs have always been carried
out from April/May to November. If the analysis by Tempo2 holds for the OPERA
experiment, the excellent measurement by the OPERA collaboration will turn into
a proof of the General Relativity theory in a weak field approximation. The
analysis presented here is falsifiable because it predicts that performing the
experiment from January to March/April, the neutrino beam will be detected to
arrive 50 ns later than light.

simulations of the interaction between a circumbinary disk and a binary system,
where each star is surrounded by a disk. In particular, we approximate the
streams of mass from which the inner circumstellar disks accrete from the

the stars with the disk, in which an array of disks and streams are formed in
an inner hole. We calculate the temperature distribution of the optically thin
dust in these inner regions considering the variable impinging radiation from
both stars and use the observations to estimate the mass variations in the
streams. We find that the SEDs for both epochs can be explained with emission
from an optically thick inner edge of the circumbinary disk and from the
optically thin streams that connect the circumbinary disk with the two smaller
circumstellar disks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
the emission from the optically thin material in the hole, suggested by the
theory, is tested against observations of a binary system.

highly ionised absorbers. In one GBH, accreting close to the Eddington limit
for more than a decade, a powerful accretion disc wind is observed to be
present in softer X-ray states and it has been suggested that it can carry away
enough mass and energy to quench the radio jet. Here we report that these
winds, which may have mass outflow rates of the order of the inner accretion
rate or higher, are an ubiquitous component of the jet-free soft states of all
GBH. We furthermore demonstrate that these winds have an equatorial geometry
with opening angles of few tens of degrees, and so are only observed in sources
in which the disc is inclined at a large angle to the line of sight. The
decrease in Fe XXV / Fe XXVI line ratio with Compton temperature, observed in
the soft state, suggests a link between higher wind ionisation and harder
spectral shapes. Although the physical interaction between the wind, accretion
flow and jet is still not fully understood, the mass flux and power of these
winds, and their presence ubiquitously during the soft X-ray states suggests
they are fundamental components of the accretion phenomenon.

(2006). The aim of the three previous papers was to explore the connection
between the host galaxies and AGN activity in a radio-selected sample. We
detect nuclear X-ray emission in eight sources and radio emission in all but
one (viz., UGC6985). The new VLA observations improve the spatial resolution by
a factor of ten: the presence of nuclear radio sources in 12 of the 13 galaxies
confirms their AGN nature. As previously indicated, the behavior of the X-ray
and radio emission in these sources depends strongly on the form of their
optical surface brightness profiles derived from Hubble Space Telescope
imaging, i.e., on their classification as ""core"", ""power-law"" or ""intermediate""
galaxies. With more than twice the number of ""power-law"" and ""intermediate""

both sources. X-ray emission is detected from the entire length of the 0106+013
radio jet, which shows clear bends or wiggles - the X-ray emission is brightest
at the first prominent kpc jet bend. A picture of a helical kpc jet with the
first kpc-scale bend representing a jet segment moving close(r) to our line of
sight, and getting Doppler boosted at both radio and X-ray frequencies, is
consistent with these observations. The X-ray emission from the jet end however
peaks at about 0.4"" (~3.4 kpc) upstream of the radio hot spot. Optical emission
is detected both at the X-ray jet termination peak and at the radio hot spot.
The X-ray jet termination peak is found upstream of the radio hot spot by
around 0.2"" (~1.3 kpc) in the short projected jet of 3C345. HST optical
emission is seen in an arc-like structure coincident with the bright radio hot
spot, which we propose is a sharp (apparent) jet bend instead of a terminal
point, that crosses our line of sight and consequently has a higher Doppler
beaming factor. A weak radio hot spot is indeed observed less than 1""
downstream of the bright radio hot spot, but has no optical or X-ray
counterpart. By making use of the pc-scale radio and the kpc-scale radio/X-ray
data, we derive constraints on the jet Lorentz factors (Gamma_jet) and
inclination angles (theta): for a constant jet speed from pc- to kpc-scales, we
obtain a Gamma_jet of ~70 for 0106+013, and ~40 for 3C345. On relaxing this
assumption, we derive a Gamma_jet of ~2.5 for both the sources. Upper limits on
theta of ~13 degrees are obtained for the two quasars. (ABRIDGED)

are a crucial unknown in current star formation theory. Observations of young,
massive stars provide evidence that they form in a similar fashion to their
low-mass counterparts. The magnetic coupling between a star and its accretion
disk may be sufficient to spin down low-mass pre-main sequence (PMS) stars to
well below breakup at the end stage of their formation when the accretion rate
is low. However, we show that these magnetic torques are insufficient to spin
down massive PMS stars due to their short formation times and high accretion
rates. We develop a model for the angular momentum evolution of stars over a
wide range in mass, considering both magnetic and gravitational torques. We
find that magnetic torques are unable to spin down either low or high mass
stars during the main accretion phase, and that massive stars cannot be spun
down significantly by magnetic torques during the end stage of their formation
either. Spin-down occurs only if massive stars' disk lifetimes are
substantially longer or their magnetic fields are much stronger than current
observations suggest.

described by the Navarro et al. (1996) density profile, has on the energy
budget of a spherical, homogeneous, cloud located at different distances from
the halo center. We found that MCs located in the innermost regions of a
massive galaxy can feel a contraction force greater than their self-gravity due
to the incorporation of the potential of the galaxy's dark matter halo. We also
calculated analytically the gravitational perturbation that a MC produces over
a uniform DMB (uniform at the scales of a MC) and how this perturbation will
affect the evolution of the MC itself. The study shows that the star formation
in a MC will be considerably enhanced if the cloud is located in a dense and
low velocity dark matter environment. We confirm our results by measuring the
star formation efficiency in numerical simulations of the formation and
evolution of MCs within different DMBs. Our study indicates that there are
situations where the dark matter's gravitational contribution to the evolution
of the molecular clouds should not be neglected.

be quite different for particles which have about the same mass. Therefore the
idea to interpret this centrality dependence as a consequence of a collective

decrease in hydrogen opacity, makes these stars appear subluminous in the

helium abundance, due to their lower mass at the main sequence turnoff. For
this reason, the phenomenon is more common in those massive globular clusters
that show evidence for secondary populations enhanced in helium. However, a
high helium abundance does not, by itself, explain the presence of blue hook

problem is to find a set of $k$ {\em centers} $C = \{c_1,...,c_k\}, c_i \in

where $d(x,C)$ denotes the distance between $x$ and the closest center in $C$,
is minimized. This is one of the most prominent objective functions that have
been studied with respect to clustering.
  $D^2$-sampling \cite{ArthurV07} is a simple non-uniform sampling technique
for choosing points from a set of points. It works as follows: given a set of
points $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, the first point is chosen uniformly at
random from $P$. Subsequently, a point from $P$ is chosen as the next sample
with probability proportional to the square of the distance of this point to
the nearest previously sampled points.
  $D^2$-sampling has been shown to have nice properties with respect to the
$k$-means clustering problem. Arthur and Vassilvitskii \cite{ArthurV07} show
that $k$ points chosen as centers from $P$ using $D^2$-sampling gives an
$O(\log{k})$ approximation in expectation. Ailon et. al. \cite{AJMonteleoni09}
and Aggarwal et. al. \cite{AggarwalDK09} extended results of \cite{ArthurV07}
to show that $O(k)$ points chosen as centers using $D^2$-sampling give $O(1)$
approximation to the $k$-means objective function with high probability. In
this paper, we further demonstrate the power of $D^2$-sampling by giving a
simple randomized $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that uses the
$D^2$-sampling in its core.

well-defined MIR ``dust bump''. Strong silicate emission is present in many of
these objects. We speculate that this, together with high ratios of silicate
strength to hydrogen column density, could suggest optically thin dust and low
dust-to-gas ratios, in accordance with model predictions that LLAGN do not host
a Seyfert-like obscuring torus.

such performance is normally associated with large laser cavities, because
increasing energy storage reduces quantum phase noise and also renders the
laser frequency less sensitive to cavity vibration. This basic scaling rule is
at odds with an emerging set of optical systems that place focus on compact
(optimally integrable) sources of high coherence light. These include
phase-coherent optical communication using quadrature-amplitude-modulation, and
also record-low phase noise microwave sources based upon optical comb
techniques. In this work, the first, chip-based Brillouin laser is
demonstrated. It features high-efficiency and single-line operation with the
smallest recorded Schawlow-Townes frequency noise for any chip-based laser.
Because the frequency offset between the laser's emission and the input pump is
relatively small, the device provides a new function: spectral purification of
compact, low coherence sources such as semiconductor lasers.

code to study the formation of slow-mode shocks in collisionless magnetic
reconnection in low beta plasmas, and we focus on the relation between the
formation of slow shocks and the ion temperature anisotropy enhanced at the
shock downstream region. It is known that as magnetic reconnection develops,
the parallel temperature along the magnetic field becomes large in association
with the anisotropic PSBL (plasma sheet boundary layer) ion beams, and this
temperature anisotropy has a tendency to suppress the formation of slow shocks.
Based on our simulation result, we found that the slow shock formation is
suppressed due to the large temperature anisotropy near the X-type region, but
the ion temperature anisotropy relaxes with increasing the distance from the
magnetic neutral point. As a result, two pairs of current structures, which are
the strong evidence of dissipation of magnetic field in slow shocks, are formed
at the distance x > 115 ion inertial lengths from the neutral point.

cognitive radio networks when the sensing is imperfect and a secondary user has
limited traffic to send at a time is investigated. Primary users' statistical
information is assumed to be unknown, and therefore, a secondary user needs to
learn the information online during channel sensing and access process, which
means learning loss, also referred to as regret, is inevitable. In this
research, the case when all potential channels can be sensed simultaneously is
investigated first. The channel access process is modeled as a multi-armed
bandit problem with side observation. And channel access rules are derived and
theoretically proved to have asymptotically finite regret. Then the case when
the secondary user can sense only a limited number of channels at a time is
investigated. The channel sensing and access process is modeled as a bi-level
multi-armed bandit problem. It is shown that any adaptive rule has at least
logarithmic regret. Then we derive channel sensing and access rules and
theoretically prove they have logarithmic regret asymptotically and with finite
time. The effectiveness of the derived rules is validated by computer
simulation.

useful range properties while the latter class is of importance for interior

subdifferential operators and known to coincide for certain matrices; however,
more precise relationships between rectangularity and paramonotonicity were not

  Our aim is to provide new results and examples concerning these notions. It

Moreover, for linear relations, rectangularity implies paramonotonicity but the

is affective, as it was the textbook where I first learned the basic principles
of quantum mechanics. Beyond my personal taste, I now recognize that
Gasiorowicz (1974) is still a very good textbook on quantum mechanics, with a
rigorous theoretical approach accompanied by a wide collection of applications.
If the textbook by Gasiorowicz was my main basis, I have taken much also from
other textbooks such as Phillips (2003), as well as from the excellent
classical textbook by Dirac (1981). In order to avoid complications in the
mathematics and in the notation, the topic is presented in these notes with
reference to one-dimensional systems, with just a few marginal extensions to
the three-dimensional formulation.

interactions is generally a poorly conditioned problem. L. Reatto (Phil. Mag. A
58, 37 (1986)) showed that for atomic liquids close to the triple point,
inversions are hard because the structure closely resembles that of an
equivalent hard-sphere fluid. Here I demonstrate that at low concentrations and
for particles with short-ranged attractive potentials, S(k) also exhibits a
very weak dependence on potential shape. Instead, different potentials can
generate an S(k) that closely resembles that of the Baxter model with a similar
second-virial coefficient. By contrast, in this energetic fluid regime, the
inversion of an attractive interaction from real-space correlations such as the
radial distribution function g(r) is well conditioned. Nevertheless, one may
extract further information from S(k) by measuring isosbestic points, values of
k where the scattering intensity I(k) or the structure factor S(k) is invariant
to changes in interaction-potential well-depth. These points suggest a new
extended corresponding states principle for particles in solution based on the
packing fraction, the second osmotic virial coefficient, and a new measure of
effective potential range.

a powerful tool to study the structures and dynamics of our Galaxy. Honma et
al. (2007) (hereafter H2007) claimed that the annual parallax of S269 is
determined within an error of 0.008 milliarcsec (mas), concluding that S269 is
located at 5.3 kpc +- 0.2 kpc from the sun, and R= 13.1 kpc. They claimed that
the rotational velocity of S269 is equal to that of the sun within a 3% error.
This small error, however, is hardly understood when taking into account the
results of other observations and theoretical studies of galactic dynamics. We
here reanalyzed the VERA archival data using the self-calibration method
(hybrid mapping), and found that clusters of maser features of S269 are
distributed in much wider area than that investigated in H2007. We confirmed
that, if we make a narrow region image without considering the presence of
multiple maser spots, and only the phase calibration is applied, we can
reproduce the same maser structures in H2007. The distribution extent of maser
spots in the feature differs 0.2 mas from east to west between our results and
H2007. Moreover, we found that change of relative positions of maser spots in
the cluster reaches 0.1 mas or larger between observational epochs. This
suggests that if one simply assumes the time-dependent, widely distributed
maser sources as a stable single point source, it could cause errors of up to
0.1 mas in the annual parallax of S269. Taking into account the internal
motions of maser spot clusters, the proper motion of S269 cannot be determined
precisely. We estimated that the peculiar motion of S269 with respect to a
Galactic circular rotation is ~20 km/s. These results imply that the observed
kinematics of maser emissions in S269 cannot give a strong constraint on
dynamics of the outer part of the Galaxy, in contrast to the claim by H2007.

torus models and a Bayesian approach to fit the infrared (IR) nuclear SEDs.
These dusty tori have physical sizes smaller than 6 pc radius, as derived from
our fits. Active galactic nuclei (AGN) unification schemes account for a
variety of observational differences in terms of viewing geometry. However, we
find evidence that strong unification may not hold, and that the immediate
dusty surroundings of Sy1 and Sy2 nuclei are intrinsically different. The Type
2 tori studied here are broader, have more clumps, and these clumps have lower
optical depths than those of Type 1 tori. The larger the covering factor of the
torus, the smaller the probability of having direct view of the AGN, and
vice-versa. In our sample, Sy2 tori have larger covering factors
(C_T=0.95+/-0.02) and smaller escape probabilities than those of Sy1
(C_T=0.5+/-0.1). Thus, on the basis of the results presented here, the
classification of a Seyfert galaxy may depend more on the intrinsic properties
of the torus rather than on its mere inclination, in contradiction with the
simplest unification model.

Landau-Placzek ratio, R/B, of the Rayleigh scattering intensity over the total
Brillouin, was measured thanks to the dynamically controlled stability of the
used Fabry-Perot interferometer. It was observed that the R/B ratio follows two
stages as a function of increasing dilution rate: after a strong decrease
between 0.2M and 2.10^-5 M, it increases to reach a maximum between 10^-9 M and
10^-16 M. The first stage corresponds to the decrease of the Rayleigh
scattering by the ion concentration fluctuations with the decrease of salt
concentration. The second stage, at lower concentrations, is consistent with
the increase of the Rayleigh scattering by long-lived sub-microscopic bubbles
with the decrease of ion concentration. The origin of these sub-microscopic
bubbles is the shaking of the solutions which was carried out after each
centesimal dilution. The very long lifetime of the sub-microscopic bubbles and
the effects of aging originate in the electric charge of bubbles. The increase
of R/B with the decrease of the low salt concentration corresponds to the
increase of the sub-microscopic bubble size with the decrease of concentration,
that is imposed by the bubble stability due to the covering of the surface
bubble by negative ions.

technique. The first one is getting a uniform estimate of stochastic
convolution of $\alpha$-stable processes. Since $\alpha$-stable noises only
have $p<\alpha$ moment, unlike the stochastic convolution of Wiener process,
the well known Da Prato-Kwapie\'n-Zabczyk's factorization ([5]) is not

inequality, we obtain a uniform estimate similar to that of stochastic
convolution of Wiener process. Using this estimate, we show that the stochastic
convolution of $\alpha$-stable noises stays, with positive probability, in
arbitrary small ball with zero center. These two results are important for
studying ergodicity and regularity of stochastic PDEs forced by $\alpha$-stable
noises ([9]). The third application is getting the same results as in [12]. The
fourth one gives the trajectory regularity of stochastic Burgers equation
forced by $\alpha$-stable noises ([9]). Finally, applying a similar integration
by parts to stochastic convolution of Wiener noises, we get the uniform
estimate and continuity property originally obtained by Da

tangential to the Stokes $I$ dust continuum emission contours. The magnetic
field and the emission gradient orientations, therefore, show some correlation.
A method is proposed, which -- in the framework of ideal magneto-hydrodynamics
(MHD) -- connects the measured angle between magnetic field and emission
gradient orientations to the total field strength. The approach is based on the
assumption that a change in emission intensity (gradient) is a measure for the
resulting direction of motion in the MHD force equation. In particular, this
new method leads to maps of position-dependent magnetic field strength
estimates. When evaluating the field curvature and the gravity direction
locally on a map, the method can be generalized to arbitrary cloud shapes. The
technique is applied to high-resolution ($\sim0\farcs7$) Submillimeter Array
polarization data of the collapsing core W51 e2. A tentative $\sim 7.7$~mG
field strength is found when averaging over the entire core. The analysis
further reveals some structures and an azimuthally averaged radial profile
$\sim r^{-1/2}$ for the field strength. Maximum values close to the center are
around $19$~mG. The currently available observations lack higher resolution
data to probe the innermost part of the core where the largest field strength
is expected from the method. Application regime and limitations of the method
are discussed. As a further important outcome of this technique, the local
significance of the magnetic field force compared to the other forces can be
quantified in a model-independent way, from measured angles only. Finally, the
method can potentially also be expanded and applied to other objects (besides
molecular clouds) with measurements that reveal the field morphology, as e.g.
Faraday rotation measurements in galaxies.

Compared to the radio ICRF2, the SDSS provides two orders of magnitude less
accurate astrometric data in the optical. However, its extensive sky coverage
and faint magnitude limit allow us to directly relate the positions of a large
sample of radio sources. This way we provide an independent check of the
overall accuracy of the SDSS positions and confirm that the astrometric
calibration of the latest Data Release 8 (DR8) is poorer than that of the DR7.

  Astrophysics",,"10.1051/0004-6361/201118475",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The formation of planetesimals is often accredited to collisional sticking of
dust grains. The exact process is unknown, as collisions between larger
aggregates tend to lead to fragmentation or bouncing rather than sticking.
Recent laboratory experiments have however made great progress in the
understanding and mapping of the complex physics involved in dust collisions.
We want to study the possibility of planetesimal formation using the results
from the latest laboratory experiments, particularly by including the
fragmentation with mass transfer effect, which might lead to growth even at
high impact velocities. We present a new experimentally and physically
motivated dust collision model capable of predicting the outcome of a collision
between two particles of arbitrary masses and velocities. It is used together
with a continuum dust-size evolution code that is both fast in terms of
execution time and able to resolve the dust well at all sizes, allowing for all
types of interactions to be studied without biases. We find that for the
general dust population, bouncing collisions prevent the growth above
millimeter-sizes. However, if a small number of cm-sized particles are
introduced, for example due to vertical mixing or radial drift, they can act as
a catalyst and start to sweep up the smaller particles. At a distance of 3 AU,
100-meter-sized bodies are formed on a timescale of 1 Myr. We conclude that
direct growth of planetesimals might be a possibility thanks to a combination
of the existence of a bouncing barrier and the fragmentation with mass transfer
effect. The bouncing barrier is here even beneficial, as it prevents the growth
of too many large particles that would otherwise only fragment among each
other, and creates a reservoir of small particles that can be swept up by
larger bodies. However, for this process to work, a few seeds of cm in size or
larger have to be introduced.

neutron beam delivery and instrumentation, because they offer increased
performance over straight or linearly tapered guides. However, like other
ballistic geometries they have the potential to create significantly
non-trivial instrumental resolution functions. We address the source of the
most prominent optical aberration, namely coma, and we show that for extended
sources the off-axis rays have a different focal length from on-axis rays,
leading to multiple reflections in the guide system. We illustrate how the
interplay between coma, sources of finite size, and mirrors with non-perfect
reflectivity can therefore conspire to produce uneven distributions in the
neutron beam divergence, the source of complicated resolution functions. To
solve these problems, we propose a hybrid elliptic-parabolic guide geometry.
Using this new kind of neutron guide shape, it is possible to condition the
neutron beam and remove almost all of the aberrations, whilst providing the
same performance in beam current as a standard elliptic neutron guide. We
highlight the positive implications for a number of neutron scattering
instrument types that this new shape can bring.

flooding-improved Berry-Robnik distribution, in which an effectively reduced
size of the regular island enters. To additionally describe power-law level
repulsion at small spacings, we extend this prediction by explicitly
considering the tunneling couplings between regular and chaotic states. This
results in a flooding- and tunneling-improved Berry-Robnik distribution which

consisting of $N$ nodes, congestion scales as $O(N^2/\log(N))$ independently of
how flows may be routed. This is in contrast to the $O(N^{3/2})$ scaling of
congestion in a flat polynomially growing network. We also show that without
the planarity condition, congestion in a small world network could scale as low
as $O(N^{1+\epsilon})$, for arbitrarily small $\epsilon$. These extreme results
demonstrate that the small world property by itself cannot provide guidance on
the level of congestion in a network and other characteristics are needed for
better resolution. Finally, we investigate scaling of congestion under the
geodesic flow, that is, when flows are routed on shortest paths based on a link
metric. Here we prove that if the link weights are scaled by arbitrarily small
or large multipliers then considerable changes in congestion may occur.
However, if we constrain the link-weight multipliers to be bounded away from
both zero and infinity, then variations in congestion due to such remetrization
are negligible.

content dissemina- tion framework that harnesses ad hoc communication
opportunities to minimize the load on the wireless infrastructure while
guaranteeing tight delivery delays. It achieves this through a control loop
that collects user-sent acknowledgements to determine if new copies need to be
reinjected into the network through the 3G interface. Push-and-Track is
flexible and can be applied to a variety of scenarios, including periodic
message flooding and floating data. For the former, this paper examines
multiple strategies to determine how many copies of the content should be
injected, when, and to whom; for the latter, it examines the achievable offload
ratio depending on the freshness constraints. The short delay-tolerance of
common content, such as news or road traffic updates, make them suitable for
such a system. Use cases with a long delay-tolerance, such as software updates,
are an even better fit. Based on a realistic large-scale vehicular dataset from
the city of Bologna composed of more than 10,000 vehicles, we demonstrate that
Push-and-Track consistently meets its delivery objectives while reducing the

its decrease for width < 25 nm, partly attributed to amorphization at the
edges, provides a valuable experimental estimate on D mode relaxation length of
<5 nm. The upshift in the G band of the narrowest GNRs can be attributed to
confinement effect or chemical doping by functional groups on the GNR edges.
Notably, GNRs are much more susceptible to photothermal effects resulting in
reversible hole doping caused by atmospheric oxygen than bulk graphene sheets.
Finally we show that the 2D band is still a reliable marker in determining the
number of layers of GNRs despite its significant broadening for very narrow
GNRs.

colloidal suspensions using cone-plate rheometry and simultaneous confocal
imaging. In the colloidal glass regime, for smooth, non-stick walls, the solid
nature of the suspension causes a transition in the rheology from
Herschel-Bulkley (HB) bulk flow behavior at large stress to a Bingham-like slip
behavior at low stress, which is suppressed for sufficient colloid-wall
attraction or colloid-scale wall roughness. Visualization shows how the
slip-shear transition depends on gap size and the boundary conditions at both
walls and that partial slip persist well above the yield stress. A
phenomenological model, incorporating the Bingham slip law and HB bulk flow,
fully accounts for the behavior. Microscopically, the Bingham law is related to
a thin (sub-colloidal) lubrication layer at the wall, giving rise to a
characteristic dependence of slip parameters on particle size and
concentration. We relate this to the suspension's osmotic pressure and yield
stress and also analyze the influence of van der Waals interaction. For the
largest concentrations, we observe non-uniform flow around the yield stress, in
line with recent work on bulk shear-banding of concentrated pastes. We also
describe residual slip in concentrated liquid suspensions, where the vanishing
yield stress causes coexistence of (weak) slip and bulk shear flow for all
measured rates.

estimate of the contribution to the curvature perturbation generated during the
linear era of the hybrid inflation waterfall. The spectrum of this contribution
peaks at some wavenumber $k=k_*$, and goes like $k^3$ for $k\ll k_*$, making it
typically negligible on cosmological scales. The scale $k_*$ can be outside the
horizon at the end of inflation, in which case $\zeta=- (g^2 - \vev{g^2})$ with
$g$ gaussian. Taking this into account, the cosmological bound on the abundance
of black holes is likely to be satisfied if the curvaton mass $m$ much bigger
than the Hubble parameter $H$, but is likely to be violated if $m\lsim H$.
Coming to the contribution to $\zeta$ from the rest of the waterfall, we are
led to consider the use of the `end-of-inflation' formula, giving the
contribution to $\zeta$ generated during a sufficiently sharp transition from
nearly-exponential inflation to non-inflation, and we state for the first time
the criterion for the transition to be sufficiently sharp. Our formulas are

formation region W51 from the largest parent cloud ($\sim$ 2~pc, JCMT) to the
large-scale envelope ($\sim$ 0.5~pc, BIMA) down to the collapsing core e2
($\sim$ 60~mpc, SMA). Magnetic field and dust emission gradient orientations
reveal a correlation which becomes increasingly more tight with higher
resolution. The previously developed polarization - intensity gradient method
(Koch et al. 2012) is applied in order to quantify the magnetic field
significance. This technique provides a way to estimate the local magnetic
field force compared to gravity without the need of any mass or field strength
measurements, solely making use of measured angles which reflect the
geometrical imprint of the various forces. All three data sets clearly show
regions with distinct features in the field-to-gravity force ratio. Azimuthally
averaged radial profiles of this force ratio reveal a transition from a field
dominance at larger distances to a gravity dominance closer to the emission
peaks. Normalizing these profiles to a characteristic core scale points toward
self-similarity. Furthermore, the polarization intensity-gradient method is
linked to the mass-to-flux ratio, providing a new approach to estimate the
latter one without mass and field strength inputs. A transition from a
magnetically supercritical to a subcritical state as a function of distance
from the emission peak is found for the e2 core. Finally, based on the measured
radius-dependent field-to-gravity force ratio we derive a modified star
formation efficiency with a diluted gravity force. Compared to a standard
(free-fall) efficiency, the observed field is capable of reducing the
efficiency down to 10\% or less.

obtained from a fit to measurements in tracking detectors. The parametrization
of the trajectory has to account for bending in the magnetic field, energy loss
and multiple scattering in the detector material. General broken lines
implement a track model with proper description of multiple scattering leading
to linear equations with a special structure of the corresponding matrix
allowing for a fast solution with the computing time depending linearly on the
number of measurements. The calculation of the full covariance matrix along the
trajectory enables the application to track based alignment and calibration of
large detectors with global methods.

typically limited in sensitivity by their prohibitive computing cost. Therefore
semi-coherent methods (such as StackSlide) can often achieve a better
sensitivity. We develop an analytical method for finding optimal StackSlide
parameters at fixed computing cost under ideal conditions of gapless data with
Gaussian stationary noise. This solution separates two regimes: an unbounded
regime, where it is always optimal to use all the data, and a bounded regime
with a finite optimal observation time. Our analysis of the sensitivity scaling
reveals that both the fine- and coarse-grid mismatches contribute equally to
the average StackSlide mismatch, an effect that had been overlooked in previous
studies. We discuss various practical examples for the application of this
optimization framework, illustrating the potential gains in sensitivity
compared to previous searches.

map the electronic structure and spin texture of the surface states of the
topological insulator Sb2Te3. In combination with density functional
calculations (DFT), we directly show that Sb2Te3 exhibits a partially occupied,
single spin-Dirac cone around the Fermi energy, which is topologically
protected. DFT obtains a spin polarization of the occupied Dirac cone states of
80-90%, which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental data after
careful background subtraction. Furthermore, we observe a strongly spin-orbit
split surface band at lower energy. This state is found at 0.8eV below the
Fermi level at the gamma-point, disperses upwards, and disappears at about
0.4eV below the Fermi level into two different bulk bands. Along the gamma-K
direction, the band is located within a spin-orbit gap. According to an
argument given by Pendry and Gurman in 1975, such a gap must contain a surface
state, if it is located away from the high symmetry points of the Brillouin
zone. Thus, the novel spin-split state is protected by symmetry, too.

containing two pentagons, three hexagons and two heptagons, resulting from
local rearrange- ments around a divacancy in pristine graphene or nanotubes.
This defect can be inserted in sheets or tubes either individually or as
extended defect lines. Sheets or tubes containing only this defect as a pattern
can also be obtained. These fully defective sheets, and most of the tubes,
present a very pronounced rippled (wavy) structure and their energies are lower
than other structures based on pentagons and heptagons published so far.
Another particularity of these rippled carbon sheets is their ability to fold
themselves into a two-dimensional porous network of inter- connected tubes upon
heat treatment as shown by hybrid Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, contrary to
the common belief that pentagon/heptagon based structures are metallic, this
work shows that this defect pattern should give rise to semi-metallic
conduction.

vertices in 4D gauge theory, is related to the action of just-not-resolved
selfdual and thermal gauge field configurations, calorons and anticalorons, of
charge modulus unity. Appealing to the derivation of the effective theory for
the deconfining phase of SU(2) Yang-Mills thermodynamics, we conclude that
these vertex inducers convey a rapidly decreasing interaction strength between
{\sl fundamental} plane waves when the momentum transfer is increased away from
the scale of maximal, {\sl effective} resolution. This adds a deeper
justification to the renormalization programme of perturbation theory which
ignores the contribution to the partition function of nontrivially selfdual
configurations. We also point out a connection between the QED fine-structure
constant $\alpha$ and the electric-magnetically dual of the effective gauge
coupling in the deconfining phase, and we illustrate the workings of effective
loops in the expansion of the pressure.
