Starobinsky's R^2-model. The latter is due to inflaton gravitation decays
dominated by scalar particle production. It is tempting to suggest that dark
matter particles are also produced in this process. Since free scalars being
too hot cannot serve as viable dark matter (Phys.Lett.B700:157-162,2011), we
further study the issue considering two options: scalars with non-minimal
coupling to gravity and superheavy scalars generated at inflationary stage. We
found that the first option allows for viable warm or cold dark matter if
scalar mass exceeds 0.8 MeV. The second option implies supercold dark matter
with particle mass 10^16 GeV, which production is saturated at the end of
inflation when inflaton-dependent scalar mass rapidly changes and violates
adiabaticity. Similar result holds for superheavy fermion dark matter.

have kinetic luminosities \sim {\eta}L_Edd/2 \sim 0.05L_Edd and momentum rates

expanding two-phase medium in which molecular species coexist with hot gas,
which can persist after the central AGN has switched off. This picture predicts
outflow velocities \sim 1000 - 1500 km/s and mass outflow rates up to 4000

two-electron system bounded by a core-shell potential, where the core width is
varied continuously until it eventually vanishes. This simple system displays a
rich and complex behavior: as the core width is varied, this system is
characterized by two peculiar transitions where, for different reasons, it
displays characteristics similar to a few-particle quantum phase transition.
The first occurrence corresponds to something akin to a second order quantum
phase transition, while the second transition is marked by a discontinuity,
with respect to the driving parameter, in the first derivatives of quantities
like energy and entanglement. The study of this system allows to shed light on
the sudden variation of entanglement and energy observed in S. Abdullah et al.
[Phys. Rev. B 80, 235302 (2009)]. We also compare the core-shell system with a
system where a core well is absent: this shows that, even when extremely
narrow, the core well has a relevant `pinning' effect. Interestingly, depending
on the potential symmetry, the pinning of the wavefunction may either halve or
double the system entanglement (with respect to the no-core-well system) when
the ground state is already bounded to the outer (shell) well. In the process
we discuss the system fidelity and show the usefulness of considering the
particle density fidelity as opposed to the more commonly used -- but much more
difficult to access -- wavefunction fidelity. In particular we demonstrate that
-- for ground-states with nodeless spatial wavefunctions -- the particle
density fidelity is zero if and only if the wavefunction fidelity is zero.

signals into sequences of spikes sent to the brain. However, adaptation also
entails computational costs: adaptive code is intrinsically ambiguous, because
output symbols cannot be trivially mapped back to the stimuli without the
knowledge of the adaptive state of the encoding neuron. It is thus important to
learn which statistical changes in the input do, and which do not, invoke
adaptive responses, and ask about the reasons for potential limits to
adaptation. We measured the ganglion cell responses in the tiger salamander
retina to controlled changes in the second (contrast), third (skew) and fourth
(kurtosis) moments of the light intensity distribution of spatially uniform
temporally independent stimuli. The skew and kurtosis of the stimuli were
chosen to cover the range observed in natural scenes. We quantified adaptation
in ganglion cells by studying two-dimensional linear-nonlinear models that
capture well the retinal encoding properties across all stimuli. We found that
the retinal ganglion cells adapt to contrast, but exhibit remarkably invariant
behavior to changes in higher-order statistics. Finally, by theoretically
analyzing optimal coding in LN-type models, we showed that the neural code can
maintain a high information rate without dynamic adaptation despite changes in
stimulus skew and kurtosis.

independent simulations of many flux tubes, of a three-dimensional sheared
double arcade, in which the thermal nonequilibrium process governs the plasma
evolution. We have found that the condensations in the corona can be divided
into two populations: threads and blobs. Threads are massive condensations that
linger in the field line dips. Blobs are ubiquitous small condensations that
are produced throughout the filament and overlying arcade magnetic structure,
and rapidly fall to the chromosphere. The threads are the principal
contributors to the total mass. The total prominence mass is in agreement with
observations, assuming a reasonable filling factor. The motion of the threads
is basically horizontal, while blobs move in all directions along the field.
The peak velocities for both populations are comparable. We have generated
synthetic images of the whole structure in an H$\alpha$ proxy and in two EUV
channels of the AIA instrument aboard SDO, thus showing the plasma at cool,
warm, and hot temperatures. The predicted differential emission measure of our

via synapses modeled as pulses of finite amplitude and duration. For such
synapses, by introducing two distinct types of synaptic events (pulse emission
and termination), we were able to write down an exact event-driven map for the
system and to evaluate the splay state solutions. For M overlapping post
synaptic potentials the linear stability analysis of the splay state should
take in account, besides the actual values of the membrane potentials, also the
firing times associated to the M previous pulse emissions. As a matter of fact,
it was possible, by introducing M complementary variables, to rephrase the
evolution of the network as an event-driven map and to derive an analytic
expression for the Floquet spectrum. We find that, independently of M, the
splay state is marginally stable with N-2 neutral directions. Furthermore, we
have identified a family of periodic solutions surrounding the splay state and
sharing the same neutral stability directions. In the limit of $\delta$-pulses,
it is still possible to derive an event-driven formulation for the dynamics,
however the number of neutrally stable directions, associated to the splay
state, becomes N. Finally, we prove a link between the results for our system
and a previous theory [Watanabe and Strogatz, Physica D, 74 (1994), pp. 197-

several different types of coupled DE scenarios both based on the FoF algorithm
and on the SO halo identification for different values of the overdensity
threshold $\Delta_{c}$. We compare the computed HMFs for coupled DE cosmologies
with $\Lambda $CDM as well as with the predictions of the standard analytic
fitting functions. Our results show that the standard fitting functions still
reproduce reasonably well both the FoF and the SO HMFs of interacting DE
cosmologies at intermediate masses and at low redshifts, once rescaled to the
characteristic amplitude of linear density perturbations of each specific model
as given by $\sigma_{8}$. However, we also find that such apparent degeneracy
with $\sigma_{8}$ is broken both by the high-mass tail and by the redshift
evolution of our HMFs, with deviations beyond $\sim 10%$ for most of the models
under investigation. Furthermore, the discrepancy with respect to the
predictions of standard fitting functions rescaled with the characteristic
value of $\sigma_{8}$ shows -- for some models -- a strong dependence on the
spherical overdensity threshold $\Delta_{c}$ used for the halo identification.
We find that such effect is due to a significant increase of halo concentration
at low redshifts in these models, that is however absent in the majority of the
cosmological scenarios considered in this work. We can therefore conclude that
the universality of the HMF is violated by cosmological models that feature a
direct interaction between DE and CDM.

overfitting and gear solution towards prior information. In general, a
regularized estimation problem minimizes the sum of a loss function and a
penalty term. The penalty term is usually weighted by a tuning parameter and
encourages certain constraints on the parameters to be estimated. Particular
choices of constraints lead to the popular lasso, fused-lasso, and other
generalized $l_1$ penalized regression methods. Although there has been a lot
of research in this area, developing efficient optimization methods for many
nonseparable penalties remains a challenge. In this article we propose an exact
path solver based on ordinary differential equations (EPSODE) that works for
any convex loss function and can deal with generalized $l_1$ penalties as well
as more complicated regularization such as inequality constraints encountered
in shape-restricted regressions and nonparametric density estimation. In the
path following process, the solution path hits, exits, and slides along the
various constraints and vividly illustrates the tradeoffs between goodness of
fit and model parsimony. In practice, the EPSODE can be coupled with AIC, BIC,
$C_p$ or cross-validation to select an optimal tuning parameter. Our
applications to generalized $l_1$ regularized generalized linear models,
shape-restricted regressions, Gaussian graphical models, and nonparametric

gravitational waves. A gravitational wave signal appears in pulsar timing
residuals through two components: one independent of and one dependent on the
pulsar's distance, called the 'Earth term' (ET) and 'pulsar term' (PT),
respectively. The signal of a burst (or transient) gravitational wave source in
pulsars' residuals will in general have the Earth and pulsar terms separated by
times of the order of the time of flight from the pulsar to the Earth.
Therefore, both terms are not observable over a realistic observation span, but
the ETs observed in many pulsars should be correlated. We show that pairs (or
more) of pulsars can be aligned in such a way that the PTs caused by a source
at certain sky locations can arrive at Earth within a time window short enough
to be captured during a realistic observation span. We find that for the
pulsars within the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) ~67 per cent of the
sky produces such alignments for pulsars terms separated by less than 10 years.
We compare estimates of the source event rate that would be required to observe
one signal in the IPTA if searching for the correlated ETs, or in searching via
the PTs, and find that event rates would need to be about two orders of
magnitude higher to observe an event with the PTs than the ETs. We also find
that an array of hundreds of thousands of pulsars would be required to achieve
similar numbers of observable events in PT or ET searches. This disfavours PTs
being used for all-sky searches, but they could potentially be used target
specific sources and be complementary to ET only searches.

the movement of the fish inferred from pulse amplitude variability at each
detection dipole. All fish presented very long transient exploratory behavior
(about 8hours) when exposed to a new environment in the absence of stimuli.
After the transient there were several intervals(5min-2hours),in which entropy
vanished and no movement was observed, that could be associated with behavioral
sleeping. Our experiments also revealed that fish are able to discriminate
between real and random stimuli distributions by changing the timing
probability of the next discharge. Moreover,most fish presented behavioral
sleep periods when the artificial fish timestamp sequence was random,but no
fish showed any behavioral sleep period when the artificial fish fired

carbon and silicate grains of various sizes or dust of the diffuse ISM. The IR
emission and the midplane temperature derived by the MC method differ from
models where the radiative transfer is solved in slab geometry of small ring
segments. In the MC treatment, dusty halos above the disks are considered.
Halos lead to an enhanced IR emission and warmer midplane temperature than do
pure disks. Under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium we find that the
disk in the inner rim puffs up, followed by a shadowed region. The shadow
reduces the temperature of the midplane and decreases the height of the
extinction layer of the disk. It can be seen as a gap in the disk unless the
surface is again exposed to direct stellar radiation. There the disk puffs up a
second time, a third time and so forth. Therefore several gaps and ring-like
structures are present in the disk surface and appear in emission images. They
result from shadows in the disks and are present without the need to postulate
the existence of any companion or planet. As compared to Herbig Ae stars, such
gaps and ring-like structures are more pronounced in regions of terrestrial

method makes use of the parallelization capabilities of modern vectorized
computing units like graphic cards. The computational speed grows linearly with
the number of graphical processing units (GPU). On a conventional desktop PC,
our code is up to a factor 100 faster when compared to other MC algorithms. As
an example, we compute the dust emission of proto-planetary disks. We simulate
how a mid-IR instrument mounted at a future 42m ELT will detect such disks. Two
cases are distinguished: a homogeneous disk and a disk with an outward
migrating planet, producing a gap and a spiral density wave. We find that the
resulting mid-IR spectra of both disks are almost identical. However, they can
be distinguished at those wavelengths by coronographic, dual-band imaging.
Finally, the emission of PAHs exposed to different radiation fields is
computed. We demonstrate that PAH emission depends not only on the strength but
also strongly on the hardness of the radiation, a fact which has often been
neglected in previous models. We find that hard photons (>20eV) easily
dissociate all PAHs in the disks of T Tauri stars. To explain the low, but not
negligible detection rate (<10%) of PAHs in T Tau disks, we suggest that
turbulent motions act as a possible path for PAH survival.

simulations of multi-band observations of a patch of the sky, and submitting
these mock images to software usually applied to real images to extract the
photometry and then a redshift estimate for each galaxy. In this way we mimic
the most relevant sources of uncertainty present in real data analysis,
including blending and light pollution between galaxies. As an example we adopt
the infrared setup of the ESA-proposed Euclid mission, while we simulate
different observations in the optical, modifying filters, exposure times and
seeing values. Finally, we consider directly some future ground-based
experiments, such as LSST, Pan-Starrs and DES. The results highlight the
importance of u-band observations, especially to discriminate between low (z <

seeing FWHM < 1. arcsec. The former of these indications clearly favours the
LSST experiment as a counterpart for space observations, while for the other

molecules, including methane and its fluoro-substitutes, ethane, propane,
butane and benzene are presented. The annihilation gamma spectra characterise
the momentum distribution of the electron-positron pair at the instant of
annihilation. The contribution to the gamma spectra from individual molecular
orbitals is obtained from electron momentum densities calculated using modern
computational quantum chemistry density functional theory tools. The
calculation, in its simplest form, effectively treats the low-energy
(thermalised, room-temperature) positron as a plane wave and gives annihilation
gamma spectra that are about 40% broader than experiment, although the main
chemical trends are reproduced. We show that this effective ""narrowing"" of the
experimental spectra is due to the action of the molecular potential on the
positron, chiefly, due to the positron repulsion from the nuclei. It leads to a
suppression of the contribution of small positron-nuclear separations where the
electron momentum is large. To investigate the effect of the nuclear repulsion,
as well as that of short-range electron-positron and positron-molecule
correlations, a linear combination of atomic orbital description of the
molecular orbitals is employed. It facilitates the incorporation of correction
factors which can be calculated from atomic many-body theory and account for
the repulsion and correlations. Their inclusion in the calculation gives gamma
spectrum linewidths that are in much better agreement with experiment.
Furthermore, it is shown that the effective distortion of the electron momentum
density, when it is observed through positron annihilation gamma spectra, can
be approximated by a relatively simple scaling factor.

reconstructed, using web search engines, a network representing the relatedness

Relatedness between researchers and research topics was characterized by
visibility boost-increase of a researcher's visibility by focusing on a
particular topic. It was observed that researchers who had high visibility
boosts by the same research topic tended to be close to each other in their
network. We calculated correlations between visibility boosts by research
topics and researchers' interdisciplinarity at individual level (diversity of
topics related to the researcher) and at social level (his/her centrality in
the researchers' network). We found that visibility boosts by certain research
topics were positively correlated with researchers' individual-level
interdisciplinarity despite their negative correlations with the general
popularity of researchers. It was also found that visibility boosts by
network-related topics had positive correlations with researchers' social-level
interdisciplinarity. Research topics' correlations with researchers'
individual- and social-level interdisciplinarities were found to be nearly
independent from each other. These findings suggest that the notion of

greater and greater stress on meeting the constraints. In the limit as the
penalty constant tends to $\infty$, one recovers the constrained solution. In
the exact penalty method, squared penalties are replaced by absolute value
penalties, and the solution is recovered for a finite value of the penalty
constant. In practice, the kinks in the penalty and the unknown magnitude of
the penalty constant prevent wide application of the exact penalty method in
nonlinear programming. In this article, we examine a strategy of path following
consistent with the exact penalty method. Instead of performing optimization at
a single penalty constant, we trace the solution as a continuous function of
the penalty constant. Thus, path following starts at the unconstrained solution
and follows the solution path as the penalty constant increases. In the
process, the solution path hits, slides along, and exits from the various
constraints. For quadratic programming, the solution path is piecewise linear
and takes large jumps from constraint to constraint. For a general convex
program, the solution path is piecewise smooth, and path following operates by
numerically solving an ordinary differential equation segment by segment. Our
diverse applications to a) projection onto a convex set, b) nonnegative least
squares, c) quadratically constrained quadratic programming, d) geometric
programming, and e) semidefinite programming illustrate the mechanics and
potential of path following. The final detour to image denoising demonstrates
the relevance of path following to regularized estimation in inverse problems.
In regularized estimation, one follows the solution path as the penalty
constant decreases from a large value.

this paper for compression and denoising. Dimensionality reduction (DR) and
quantization modules present in many practical compression schemes such as
transform codecs, are designed to capitalize on this form of sparsity and
achieve improved reconstruction performance compared to existing
sparsity-agnostic codecs. Using training data that may be noisy a novel
sparsity-aware linear DR scheme is developed to fully exploit sparsity in the
covariance eigenvectors and form noise-resilient estimates of the principal
covariance eigenbasis. Sparsity is effected via norm-one regularization, and
the associated minimization problems are solved using computationally efficient
coordinate descent iterations. The resulting eigenspace estimator is shown
capable of identifying a subset of the unknown support of the eigenspace basis
vectors even when the observation noise covariance matrix is unknown, as long
as the noise power is sufficiently low. It is proved that the sparsity-aware
estimator is asymptotically normal, and the probability to correctly identify
the signal subspace basis support approaches one, as the number of training
data grows large. Simulations using synthetic data and images, corroborate that
the proposed algorithms achieve improved reconstruction quality relative to

proving: the procedural style (where proofs are scripts of commands, like in
Coq) and the declarative style (where proofs are texts in a controlled natural
language, like in Isabelle/Isar). Our approach combines the advantages of the
declarative style - the possibility to write formal proofs like normal
mathematical text - and the procedural style - strong automation and help with
shaping the proofs, including determining the statements of intermediate steps.
Our approach is new, and differs significantly from the ways in which the
procedural and declarative proof styles have been combined before in the
Isabelle, Ssreflect and Matita systems. Our approach is generic and can be
implemented on top of any procedural interactive theorem prover, regardless of
its architecture and logical foundations. To show the viability of our proposed
approach, we fully implemented it as a proof interface called miz3, on top of
the HOL Light interactive theorem prover. The declarative language that this
interface uses is a slight variant of the language of the Mizar system, and can
be used for any interactive theorem prover regardless of its logical
foundations. The miz3 interface allows easy access to the full set of tactics
and formal libraries of HOL Light, and as such has ""industrial strength"". Our
approach gives a way to automatically convert any procedural proof to a
declarative counterpart, where the converted proof is similar in size to the
original. As all declarative systems have essentially the same proof language,
this gives a straightforward way to port proofs between interactive theorem
provers.

almost flat potential like a pseudo-Goldstone boson. We show that the potential
of dark energy does not deviate from a constant at more than 6% over the

the Lagrangian and do not require any extra parameters; therefore there is no
evidence for augmenting the number of parameters of the LCDM paradigm. We also
find that the data justify the effective theory approach to describe
accelerated expansion and that the allowed parameters range satisfy the
expected hierarchy. Future data, both from cosmic chronometers and baryonic
acoustic oscillations, that can measure H(z) at the % level, could greatly
improve constraints on the flatness of the potential or shed some light on
possible mechanisms driving the accelerated expansion. Besides the above
result, it is shown that the effective Lagrangian of accelerated expansion can
be constrained from cosmological observations in a model-independent way and
that direct measurements of the expansion rate H(z) are most useful to do so.

sample of early-type galaxies (\sim11000) from several spectroscopic surveys,
spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 < z < 1.42). We
select the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving and
without signature of ongoing star formation. Those galaxies can be used as
standard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by Jimenez & Loeb (2002),
whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probes
H(z). We analyze the 4000 {\AA} break (D4000) as a function of redshift, use
stellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependence
of the differential age evolution on the differential D4000, and estimate the
Hubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors.
We provide 8 new measurements of H(z) (see Tab. 4), and determine its change in
H(z) to a precision of 5-12% mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z
\sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on H(z) at z \neq 0 with a
precision comparable with the one achieved for the Hubble constant (about 5-6%
at z \sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 < z < 0.8) which is crucial
to distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. These measurements have
been tested to best match a \Lambda CDM model, clearly providing a
statistically robust indication that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated
expansion. This method shows the potentiality to open a new avenue in constrain
a variety of alternative cosmologies, especially when future surveys (e.g.
Euclid) will open the possibility to extend it up to z \sim 2.

assumed to be local. This is however unstable under time evolution, we provide
proofs under several sets of assumptions. In the simplest model galaxies are
created locally and linearly biased at a single time, and subsequently move
with the matter (no velocity bias) conserving their comoving number density (no
merging). We show that, after this formation time, the bias becomes unavoidably
non-local and non-linear at large scales. We identify the non-local
gravitationally induced fields in which the galaxy overdensity can be expanded,
showing that they can be constructed out of the invariants of the deformation
tensor (Galileons). In addition, we show that this result persists if we
include an arbitrary evolution of the comoving number density of tracers. We
then include velocity bias, and show that new contributions appear, a dipole
field being the signature at second order. We test these predictions by
studying the dependence of halo overdensities in cells of fixed matter density:
measurements in simulations show that departures from the mean bias relation
are strongly correlated with the non-local gravitationally induced fields
identified by our formalism. The effects on non-local bias seen in the
simulations are most important for the most biased halos, as expected from our
predictions. The non-locality seen in the simulations is not fully captured by
assuming local bias in Lagrangian space. Accounting for these effects when
modeling galaxy bias is essential for correctly describing the dependence on
triangle shape of the galaxy bispectrum, and hence constraining cosmological
parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that using our formalism we
remove an important systematic in the determination of bias parameters from the
galaxy bispectrum, particularly for luminous galaxies. (abridged)

(derived from the previous LISA proposal) will deliver. The mission (which we
will refer to by its informal name ""eLISA"") will survey for the first time the
low-frequency gravitational wave band (about 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz), with sufficient
sensitivity to detect interesting individual astrophysical sources out to z =
15. The eLISA mission will discover and study a variety of cosmic events and
systems with high sensitivity: coalescences of massive black holes binaries,
brought together by galaxy mergers; mergers of earlier, less-massive black
holes during the epoch of hierarchical galaxy and black-hole growth;
stellar-mass black holes and compact stars in orbits just skimming the horizons
of massive black holes in galactic nuclei of the present era; extremely compact
white dwarf binaries in our Galaxy, a rich source of information about binary
evolution and about future Type Ia supernovae; and possibly most interesting of
all, the uncertain and unpredicted sources, for example relics of inflation and
of the symmetry-breaking epoch directly after the Big Bang. eLISA's
measurements will allow detailed studies of these signals with high
signal-to-noise ratio, addressing most of the key scientific questions raised
by ESA's Cosmic Vision programme in the areas of astrophysics and cosmology.
They will also provide stringent tests of general relativity in the
strong-field dynamical regime, which cannot be probed in any other way. This
document not only describes the science but also gives an overview on the
mission design and orbits.

collisional evolution of debris disks, in planetary systems that contain
multiple unstable gas giants. We previously showed that the dynamics of the
giant planets introduces a correlation between the presence of terrestrial
planets and debris disks. Here we present new simulations that show that this
connection is qualitatively robust to changes in: the mass distribution of the
giant planets, the width and mass distribution of the outer planetesimal disk,
and the presence of gas in the disk. We discuss how variations in these
parameters affect the evolution. Systems with equal-mass giant planets undergo
the most violent instabilities, and these destroy both terrestrial planets and
the outer planetesimal disks that produce debris disks. In contrast, systems
with low-mass giant planets efficiently produce both terrestrial planets and
debris disks. A large fraction of systems with low-mass outermost giant planets
have stable gaps between these planets that are frequently populated by
planetesimals. Planetesimal belts between outer giant planets may affect debris
disk SEDs. If Earth-mass seeds are present in outer planetesimal disks, the
disks radially spread to colder temperatures. We argue that this may explain
the very low frequency of > 1 Gyr-old solar-type stars with observed 24 micron
excesses. Among the (limited) set of configurations explored, the best
candidates for hosting terrestrial planets at ~1 AU are stars older than 0.1-1
Gyr with bright debris disks at 70 micron but with no currently-known giant
planets. These systems combine evidence for rocky building blocks, with giant
planet properties least likely to undergo destructive dynamical evolution. We
predict an anti-correlation between debris disks and eccentric giant planets,
and a positive correlation between debris disks and terrestrial planets.

spectroastrometry with the integral field spectrograph SINFONI at the Very

to the physical scale of the stellar diameter (~0.01 AU). The centroid of Br
gamma emission is displaced to the north with respect to the central star at
the blue side of the emission line, and to the south at the red side. The major
axis of the centroid motion is P.A.= -20 degrees, which is nearly equal to the
major axis of the protoplanetary disk projected on the sky, previously reported
by CO sub millimeter spectroscopy (P.A.= -27 degrees) The line-of-sight motion
of the Br gamma emission, in which the northern side of the disk is approaching
toward us, is also consistent with the direction of the disk rotation known
from the CO observation. The agreement implies that the kinematics of Br gamma
emission is accounted for by the ionized gas in the inner edge of the disk. A
simple modeling of the astrometry, however, indicates that the accretion inflow
similarly well reproduces the centroid displacements of Br gamma, but only if
the position angles of the centroid motion and the projected disk ellipse is a
chance coincidence. No clear evidence of disk wind is found.

presence of nondegenerate band-touching nodes, separated in momentum space, in
its bandstructure. Here we discuss a particular realization of a Weyl
semimetal: a superlattice heterostructure, made of alternating layers of
topological insulator (TI) and normal insulator (NI) material, introduced by
one of us before. The Weyl node splitting is achieved most easily in this
system by breaking time-reversal (TR) symmetry, for example by magnetic doping.
If, however, spatial inversion (I) symmetry remains, the Weyl nodes will occur
at the same energy, making it possible to align the Fermi energy simultaneously
with both nodes. The goal of this work is to explore the consequences of
breaking the I symmetry in this system. We demonstrate that, while this
generally moves the Weyl nodes to different energies, thus eliminating nodal
semimetal and producing a state with electron and hole Fermi surfaces, the
topological properties of the Weyl semimetal state, i.e. the chiral edge states
and the corresponding Hall conductivity, survive for moderate I symmetry
breaking. Moreover, we demonstrate that a new topological phenomenon arises in
this case, if an external magnetic field along the growth direction of the
heterostructure is applied. Namely, this leads to an equilibrium
dissipationless current, flowing along the direction of the field, whose
magnitude is proportional to the energy difference between the Weyl nodes and
to the magnetic field, with a universal coefficient, given by a combination of
fundamental constants.

(H2) content of high-redshift (z~5.7,6.6) Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs) extracted
from a suite of cosmological simulations. We find that the H2 mass fraction,
(f_H2), depends on three main LAE physical properties: (a) star formation rate,
(b) dust mass, and (c) cold neutral gas mass. At z~5.7, the value of f_H2 peaks
and ranges between 0.5-0.9 for intermediate mass LAEs with stellar mass M_* ~
10^{9-10} solar mass, decreasing for both smaller and larger galaxies. However,
the largest value of the H2 mass is found in the most luminous LAEs. These
trends also hold at z\sim6.6, although, due to a lower dust content,
f_H2(z=6.6)\sim0.5 f_H2(z=5.7) when averaged over all LAEs; they arise due to
the interplay between the H2 formation/shielding controlled by dust and the
intensity of the ultraviolet (UV) Lyman-Werner photo-dissociating radiation
produced by stars. We then predict the carbon monoxide (CO) luminosities for
such LAEs and check that they are consistent with the upper limits found by
Wagg et al. (2009) for two z>6 LAEs. At z\sim(5.7, 6.6), the lowest CO
rotational transition observable for both samples with the actual capabilities
of Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) is the CO(6-5). We find that at
z\sim5.7, about 1-2% of LAEs, i.e., those with an observed Lyman Alpha
luminosity larger than 10^{43.2} erg/s would be detectable with an integration
time of 5-10 hours (S/N=5); at z\sim6.6 none of the LAEs would be detectable in
CO, even with an ALMA integration time of 10 hours. We also build the CO `flux
function', i.e., the number density of LAEs as a function of the
line-integrated CO flux, S_CO, and show that it peaks at S_CO = 0.1 mJy at
z\sim5.7, progressively shifting to lower values at higher redshifts. We end by
discussing the model uncertainties.

probability that unavoidable statistical fluctuations in the data might lead to
a biased reconstruction of the dark matter parameters, or large uncertainties
on the reconstructed parameter values. We show that this probability can be
surprisingly large, even for benchmark models leading to a large event rate of
order a hundred counts. We find that combining data sets from two different
targets leads to improved coverage properties, as well as a substantial
reduction of statistical bias and uncertainty on the dark matter parameters.

chemical enrichment at the low end of the galaxy mass function, as well as on
the clustering of dark matter on small scales. In studies of Local Group dwarf
galaxies, spectroscopic samples of individual stars are used to derive the
internal kinematics and abundance properties of these galaxies. It is therefore
important to clean these samples from Milky Way stars, not related to the dwarf
galaxy, since they can contaminate the analysis of the properties of these
objects. Here we introduce a new diagnostic for separating Milky Way
contaminant stars -- that mainly constitute of dwarf stars -- and red giant
branch stars targeted in dwarf galaxies. As discriminator we use the trends in
the equivalent width of the nIR MgI line at 8806.8 \AA\ as a function of the
equivalent width of CaII triplet lines. This method is particularly useful for
works dealing with multi-object intermediate resolution spectroscopy focusing
in the region of the nIR CaII triplet. We use synthetic spectra to explore how
the equivalent width of these lines changes for stars with different properties
(gravity, effective temperature, metallicity) and find that a discrimination
among giants above the horizontal branch and dwarfs can be made with this
method at [Fe/H]> -2 dex. For -2 $\le$ [Fe/H] $\le$ -1, this method is also
valid to discriminate dwarfs and giants down to approximately one magnitude
below the horizontal branch. Using a foreground model we make predictions on
the use of this new discrimination method for nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies,
including the ultra-faints. We subsequently use VLT/FLAMES data for the
Sextans, Sculptor and Fornax dSphs to verify the predicted theoretical trends.

charged superfluid is about a million times more rigid than the normal electron
fluid. We point out that this physics should give rise to large changes in the
bulk and surface plasmon dispersion relations of metals entering the
superconducting state, that have not yet been experimentally detected and would
be in stark contradiction with the expected behavior within conventional
BCS-London theory. We also propose that this explains the puzzling experimental
observations of Avramenko et al\cite{sound} on electron sound propagation in
superconductors and the puzzling experiments of W. de Heer et al\cite{clusters}
detecting large electric dipole moments in small metal clusters, as well as the
Tao effect\cite{tao} on aggregation of superconducting microparticles in an
electric field. Associated with the enhanced charge rigidity is a large
increase in the electric screening length of superconductors at low
temperatures that has not yet been experimentally detected. The physical origin
of the enhanced charge rigidity and its relation to other aspects of the theory
of hole superconductivity is discussed.

contrast to the order-of-magnitude expressions presented by Ruderman &

that the drift velocity depends not on the absolute value, as is generally
used, but on the variation of the accelerating potential across the polar cap.
If we assume that drifting subpulses in pulsars are indeed due to this plasma
drift, several observed subpulse-drift phenomena that are incompatible with the
Ruderman & Sutherland family of models can now be explained: we show that
variations of drift rate, outright drift reversals, and the connection between
drift rates and mode changes have natural explanations within the frame of the
""standard"" pulsar model, when derived exactly. We apply this model for drifting
subpulses to the case of PSR B0826-34, an aligned pulsar with two separate
subpulse-drift regions emitted at two different colatitudes. Careful
measurement of the changing and reversing drift rate in each band independently
sets limits on the variation of the accelerating potential drop. The derived
variation is small, ~10^{-3} times the vacuum potential drop voltage. We
discuss the implications of this result for pulsar modeling.

(GCs) reflect bimodal metallicity distributions has been challenged.
Non-linearities in the colour to metallicity conversions caused by the
horizontal branch (HB) stars may be responsible for transforming a unimodal
metallicity distribution into a bimodal (optical) colour distribution. We study
optical/near-infrared (NIR) colour distributions of the GC systems in 14 E/S0
galaxies. We test whether the bimodal feature, generally present in optical
colour distributions, remains in the optical/NIR ones. The latter colour
combination is a better metallicity proxy than the former. We use KMM and GMM
tests to quantify the probability that different colour distributions are
better described by a bimodal, as opposed to a unimodal distribution. We find
that double-peaked colour distributions are more commonly seen in optical than
in optical/NIR colours. For some of the galaxies where the optical (g-z)
distribution is clearly bimodal, the (g-K) and (z-K) distributions are better
described by a unimodal distribution. The two most cluster-rich galaxies in our
sample, NGC4486 and NGC4649, show some interesting differences. The (g-K)
distribution of NGC4649 is better described by a bimodal distribution, while
this is true for the (g-K) distribution of NGC4486 GCs only if restricted to a
brighter sub-sample with small K-band errors (< 0.05 mag). Formally, the K-band
photometric errors cannot be responsible for blurring bimodal metallicity
distributions to unimodal (g-K) colour distributions. However, simulations
including the extra scatter in the colour-colour diagrams (not fully accounted
for in the photometric errors) show that such scatter may contribute to the
disappearance of bimodality in (g-K) for the full NGC4486 sample. For the less
cluster-rich galaxies results are inconclusive due to poorer statistics.

equations of an anisotropic diffusion problem with arbitrary meshes. They
depend on three factors. The first, factor proportional to a power of the
number of mesh elements, represents the condition number of the linear finite
element equations for the Laplacian operator on a uniform mesh. The other two
factors arise from the mesh nonuniformity viewed in the Euclidean metric and in
the metric defined by the diffusion matrix. The new bounds reveal that the
conditioning of the finite element equations with adaptive anisotropic meshes
is much better than what is commonly feared. Diagonal scaling for the linear
system and its effects on the conditioning are also studied. It is shown that
the Jacobi preconditioning, which is an optimal diagonal scaling for a
symmetric positive definite sparse matrix, can eliminate the effects of mesh
nonuniformity viewed in the Euclidean metric and reduce those effects of the
mesh viewed in the metric defined by the diffusion matrix. Tight bounds on the
extreme eigenvalues of the stiffness and mass matrices are obtained. Numerical

10^21 cm^-2 which is present at both z=0 and z ~ 3, and a lack of systems above
NHI ~ 10^22 cm^-2 at z=0. Using observations of the column density
distribution, we argue that the HI-H2 transition does not cause the turnover at
NHI ~ 10^21 cm^-2, but can plausibly explain the turnover at NHI > 10^22 cm^-2.
We compute the HI column density distribution of individual galaxies in the
THINGS sample and show that the turnover column density depends only weakly on
metallicity. Furthermore, we show that the column density distribution of
galaxies, corrected for inclination, is insensitive to the resolution of the HI
map or to averaging in radial shells. Our results indicate that the similarity
of HI column density distributions at z=3 and z=0 is due to the similarity of
the maximum HI surface densities of high-z and low-z disks, set presumably by
universal processes that shape properties of the gaseous disks of galaxies.
Using fully cosmological simulations, we explore other candidate physical
mechanisms that could produce a turnover in the column density distribution. We
show that while turbulence within GMCs cannot affect the DLA column density
distribution, stellar feedback can affect it significantly if the feedback is
sufficiently effective in removing gas from the central 2-3 kpc of
high-redshift galaxies. Finally, we argue that it is meaningful to compare
column densities averaged over ~ kpc scales with those estimated from quasar
spectra which probe sub-pc scales due to the steep power spectrum of HI column
density fluctuations observed in nearby galaxies.

several well-known degeneracies. These degeneracies can be broken by numerical
artefacts and also a variety of physical effects that become quantitatively
important with high-accuracy data e.g. from the Planck satellite. We study
degeneracies in models with flat and non-flat spatial sections, non-trivial
dark energy and massive neutrinos, and investigate the importance of various
physical degeneracy-breaking effects. We test the CAMB power spectrum code for
numerical accuracy, and demonstrate that the numerical calculations are
accurate enough for degeneracies to be broken mainly by true physical effects
(the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, CMB lensing and geometrical and other
effects through recombination) rather than numerical artefacts. We quantify the
impact of CMB lensing on the power spectra, which inevitably provides
degeneracy-breaking information even without using information in the
non-Gaussianity. Finally we check the numerical accuracy of sample-based
parameter constraints using CAMB and CosmoMC. In an appendix we document recent
changes to CAMB's numerical treatment of massive neutrino perturbations, which
are tested along with other recent improvements by our degeneracy exploration
results.

exceeding a few percent of the galaxy mass enclosed inside their orbital radii.
They can produce sufficient torques on dark matter halo particles, halo stars,
and the surrounding disk to lose their angular momentum and spiral into the
central region in 1 Gyr. Pairs of giant clumps with similarly large relative
masses can interact and exchange angular momentum to the same degree. The
result of this angular momentum loss is a growing central concentration of old
stars, gas, and star formation that can produce a long-lived starburst in the
inner region, identified with the BCD phase. This central concentration is
proposed to be analogous to the bulge in a young spiral galaxy. Observations of
star complexes in five local BCDs confirm the relatively large clump masses
that are expected for this process. The observed clumps also seem to contain
old field stars, even after background light subtraction, in which case the
clumps may be long-lived. The two examples with clumps closest to the center
have the largest relative clump masses and the greatest contributions from old
stars. An additional indication that the dense central regions of BCDs are like
bulges is the high ratio of the inner disk scale height to the scale length,
which is comparable to 1 for four of the galaxies.

include two-fluid instabilities, spiral density wave shocking, and bar
accretion. Young stellar pressures trigger gas accumulation on the periphery of
cleared cavities, which often take the form of rings by the time new stars
form. Stellar pressures also trigger star formation in bright-rim structures,
directly squeezing the pre-existing clumps in nearby clouds and clearing out
the lower density gas between them. Observations of these processes are common.
How they fit into the empirical star formation laws, which relate the star
formation rate primarily to the gas density, is unclear. Most likely, star
formation follows directly from the formation of cold dense gas, whatever the
origin of that gas. If the average pressure from the weight of the gas layer is
large enough to produce a high molecular fraction in the ambient medium, then
star formation should follow from a variety of processes that combine and lose
their distinctive origins. Pressurized triggering might have more influence on
the star formation rate in regions with low average molecular fraction. This
implies, for example, that the arm/interarm ratio of star formation efficiency
should be higher in the outer regions of galaxies than in the main disks.

important fundamental questions that remain unanswered on the final fate of

progress in these directions. The emerging astrophysical and observational

properties of accretion discs around black holes and naked singularities, which

significantly higher fraction of blue and star-forming galaxies and a parent
colour distribution that resembles that of the field population rather than the
overall group population. In addition, we observe correlations between the
detection of substructure and other dynamical measures, such as velocity
distributions and velocity dispersion profiles. Based on this analysis, we
conclude that some galaxy groups contain significant substructure and that
these groups have properties and galaxy populations that differ from groups

galaxies, which lie preferentially on the group outskirts and could be

been shown to produce a disk tilt naturally. In this work, we report the first

orbits, the accretion stream strikes the bright spot (which is on the rim of

observations as the basic figure of merit for detection confidence and,
together with the Fisher matrix, for the amount of physical information that
can be extracted from a detected signal. SNRs are usually computed from a
sensitivity curve, which describes the gravitational-wave amplitude needed by a
monochromatic source of given frequency to achieve a threshold SNR. For
interferometric space-based detectors similar to LISA, which are sensitive to
long-lived signals and have constantly changing position and orientation, exact
SNRs need to be computed on a source-by-source basis. For convenience, most
authors prefer to work with sky-averaged sensitivities, accepting inaccurate
SNRs for individual sources and giving up control over the statistical
distribution of SNRs for source populations. In this paper, we describe a
straightforward end-to-end recipe to compute the non-sky-averaged sensitivity
of interferometric space-based detectors of any geometry: in effect, we derive
error bars for the sky-averaged sensitivity curve, which provide a stringent
statistical interpretation for previously unqualified statements about
sky-averaged SNRs. As a worked-out example, we consider isotropic and
Galactic-disk populations of monochromatic sources, as observed with the
""classic LISA"" configuration. We confirm that the (standard) inverse-rms
average sensitivity for the isotropic population remains the same whether or
not the LISA orbits are included in the computation. However, detector motion
tightens the distribution of sensitivities, so for 50% of sources the
sensitivity is within 30% of its average. For the Galactic-disk population, the
average and the distribution of the sensitivity for a moving detector turn out
to be similar to the isotropic case.

ionizing photons are consumed by recombination inside the minihalos, where the

rate, and could potentially shorten the reionization process. This effect is
investigated here by using the analytical ""bubble model"" of reionization. We
find that in some cases, though the initiation of the EOR is delayed in the WDM

expanding shell. The expansion velocity of the shell is large (55 km s-1)
suggesting that it represents a supernova-remnant (SNR). We derive physical
parameters for the shell and show these to be consistent with the object being

are enhanced with the lowering of temperature, interestingly the area over
which the magnetic phase exists shrinks at the expense of a growing
superconducting phase in the sample. The coexistence of two phases deep inside
the superconducting phase in this compound is maintained within the temperature
range that we have explored in our experiment.

K with the structural change between tetragonal and monoclinic crystals as the
temperature is lowered. The conductivity $\sigma$ drops at MIT by four orders
of magnitude. The low-temperature monoclinic phase is known to have a lower
ground-state energy. The existence of a $k$-vector ${\boldsymbol k}$ is
prerequisite for the conduction since the ${\boldsymbol k}$ appears in the
semiclassical equation of motion for the conduction electron (wave packet).
Each wave packet is, by assumption, composed of the plane waves proceeding in
the ${\boldsymbol k}$ direction perpendicular to the plane. The tetragonal
(VO$_2$)$_3$ unit cells are periodic along the crystal's $x$-, $y$-, and
z-axes, and hence there are three-dimensional $k$-vectors. The periodicity
using the non-orthogonal bases does not legitimize the electron dynamics in
solids. There are one-dimensional ${\boldsymbol k}$ along the c-axis for a
monoclinic crystal. We believe this decrease in the dimensionality of the
$k$-vectors is the cause of the conductivity drop. Triclinic and trigonal
(rhombohedral) crystals have no $k$-vectors, and hence they must be insulators.
The majority carriers in graphite are ""electrons"", which is shown by using an
orthogonal unit cell for the hexagonal lattice.

2136 and -0.39\pm0.01 dex (sigma=0.01 dex) for NGC 2137, while the [alpha/Fe]

clusters are gravitationally bound and that they formed from the fragmentation
of the same molecular cloud that was chemically homogeneous. This is the first
firm confirmation of the binary nature of a LMC cluster pair. The most likely
fate of this system is to merge into a single structure in a time-scale
comparable with its orbital period.

It is known that under this flow there exist both initially immersed curves
which develop at least one singularity in finite time and initially embedded
curves which self-intersect in finite time. We prove that under the flow closed
curves with initial data close to a round circle in the sense of normalised
$L^2$ oscillation of curvature exist for all time and converge exponentially
fast to a round circle. This implies that for a sufficiently large `waiting
time' the evolving curves are strictly convex. We provide an optimal estimate
for this waiting time, which gives a quantified feeling for the magnitude to
which the maximum principle fails. We are also able to control the maximum of
the multiplicity of the curve along the evolution. A corollary of this estimate
is that initially embedded curves satisfying the hypotheses of the global

contractive interference functions converge when executed totally
asynchronously and, under the assumption that the communication delay is
bounded, derive an explicit bound on the convergence time penalty due to
increased delay. Finally, we demonstrate that although standard interference

respect to a certain metric. Similar results for two-sided scalable
interference functions are also derived.

the chemical master equation, and can be simulated as first order linear
differential equations through a finite state projection. Due to the very high

computationally expensive. This is a particular problem for analysis tasks
requiring repeated simulations for different parameter values. Such tasks are
computationally expensive to the point of infeasibility with the chemical

reduction techniques in order to construct accurate low-dimensional parametric
models of the chemical master equation. These surrogate models can be used in
various parametric analysis task such as identifiability analysis, parameter
estimation, or sensitivity analysis. As biological examples, we consider two
models for gene regulation networks, a bistable switch and a network displaying
stochastic oscillations. Conclusions: The results show that the parametric

with their recent incorporation into atomic-scale device fabrication strategies
as source and drain electrodes and in-plane gates. Modeling the physics of
\delta-doping at this scale proves challenging, however, due to the large
computational overhead associated with ab initio and atomistic methods. Here,
we develop an analytical theory based on an effective mass approximation. We
specifically consider the Si:P materials system, and the limit of high donor
density, which has been the subject of recent experiments. In this case,
metallic behavior including screening tends to smooth out the local disorder
potential associated with random dopant placement. While smooth potentials may
be difficult to incorporate into microscopic, single-electron analyses, the
problem is easily treated in the effective mass theory by means of a jellium
approximation for the ionic charge. We then go beyond the analytic model,
incorporating exchange and correlation effects within a simple numerical model.
We argue that such an approach is appropriate for describing realistic,
high-density, highly disordered devices, providing results comparable to
density functional theory, but with greater intuitive appeal, and lower
computational effort. We investigate valley coupling in these structures,
finding that valley splitting in the low-lying \Gamma band grows much more
quickly than the \Gamma-\Delta band splitting at high densities. We also find
that many-body exchange and correlation corrections affect the valley splitting
more strongly than they affect the band splitting.

first pulsar was found more than 40 years ago. Generally speaking, conventional
neutron stars and non-mainstream quark stars are two types of models to
describe the inner structure of pulsars, with the former composed mainly of
hadrons and the latter of a peculiar kind of matter whose state equation should
be understood in the level of quarks rather than hadrons. To construct a more
realistic model from both theoretical and observational points of view, we
conjecture that pulsars could be ""quark-cluster stars"" which are composed of
quark-clusters with almost equal numbers of up, down and strange quarks.
Clustering quark matter could be the result of strong coupling between quarks
inside realistic compact stars. The lightest quark clusters could be of
H-dibaryons, while quark clusters could also be heavier with more quarks. Being
essentially related to the non-perturbative quantum-chromo dynamics (QCD), the
state of supra-nuclear condensed matter is really difficult to obtain strictly
by only theoretical QCD-calculations, and we expect, nevertheless, that

since in cold dense matter at a few nuclear densities (2 to 10 times), quarks
could be coupled still very strongly and condensate in position space to form
quark clusters. Quark-cluster stars are chromatically confined and could
initially be bare, therefore the surface properties of quark-cluster stars
would be quite different from that of conventional neutron stars. Some facts
indicate that a bare and self-confined surface of pulsar-like compact stars
might be necessary in order to naturally understand different observational
manifestations. On one hand, as for explaining the drifting sub-pulse
phenomena, the binding energy of particles on pulsar surface should be high
enough to produce vacuum gaps, which indicates that pulsar's surface might be
strongly self-confined. On the other hand, a bare surface of quark-cluster star
can overcome the baryon contamination problem of Gamma-ray burst as well as
promote a successful core-collapse supernova. What is more, the non-atomic
thermal spectra of dead pulsars may indicate also a bare surface without
atmosphere, and the hydrocyclotron oscillation of the electron sea above the
quark-cluster star surface could be responsible for those absorption features
detected. These hints could reflect the property of compact star's surface and
possibly the state of condensed matter inside, and then might finally result in
identifying quark-cluster stars.

star clusters (NCs) and black hole (BH) seeds, in a cosmological context. We
focus on two mechanisms for the formation of BHs at high redshifts: as
end-products of (1) Population III stars in metal free halos, and of (2)
runaway stellar collisions in metal poor NCs. Our model tracks the chemical,
radiative and mechanical feedback of stars on the baryonic component of the
evolving halos. This procedure allows us to evaluate when and where the
conditions for BH formation are met, and to trace the emergence of BH seeds
arising from the dynamical channel, in a cosmological context. BHs start to
appear already at z~30 as remnants of Population III stars. The efficiency of
this mechanism begins decreasing once feedbacks become increasingly important.
Around redshift z~15, BHs mostly form in the centre of mildly metal enriched
halos inside dense NCs. The seed BHs that form along the two pathways have at
birth a mass around 100-1000M\odot. The occupation fraction of BHs is a
function of both halo mass and mass growth rate: at a given z, heavier and
faster growing halos have a higher chance to form a native BH, or to acquire an
inherited BH via merging of another system. With decreasing z, the probability
of finding a BH shifts toward progressively higher mass halo intervals. This is
due to the fact that, at later cosmic times, low mass systems rarely form a
seed, and already formed BHs are deposited into larger mass systems due to
hierarchical mergers. Our model predict that at z=0, all halos above
10^11M\odot should host a BH (in agreement with observational results), most
probably inherited during their lifetime. Halos less massive then 10^9M\odot
have a higher probability to host a native BH, but their occupation fraction
decreases below 10%.

The condition is based on asymptotic decomposition of the fourth order system

space-time), whose reciprocal positions are determined by a probabilistic law.
In such a way, concepts as ""near"", ""far"" or ""between to"" become limited. After
a huge number of measurements we can find ""far"" a particle which first was
""near"", due to displacement of space-time block where the particle has sat.
This occurence is highly improbable nowadays, but it has been the normality
just after Big Bang. At that time the universe was made by mini-blocks which

partially-observed stochastic processes that start from a set B0 and are
stopped or killed at the first hitting time of a known set A. Such processes
occur naturally within the context of a wide variety of applications. The
associated posterior distributions are highly complex and posterior parameter
inference requires the use of advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
techniques. Our approach uses a recently introduced simulation methodology,
particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) (Andrieu et. al. 2010 [1]), where
sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approximations (see Doucet et. al. 2001 [18] and
Liu 2001 [27]) are embedded within MCMC. However, when the parameter of
interest is fixed, standard SMC algorithms are not always appropriate for many
stopped processes. In Chen et. al. [11] and Del Moral 2004 [15] the authors
introduce SMC approximations of multi-level Feynman-Kac formulae, which can
lead to more efficient algorithms. This is achieved by devising a sequence of
nested sets from B0 to A and then perform the resampling step only when the
samples of the process reach intermediate level sets in the sequence.
Naturally, the choice of the intermediate level sets is critical to the
performance of such a scheme. In this paper, we demonstrate that multi-level
SMC algorithms can be used as a proposal in PMCMC. In addition, we propose a
flexible strategy that adapts the level sets for different parameter proposals.
Our methodology is illustrated on the coalescent model with migration.

multiplication, the amount of parallelism can usually be expressed as a
function of the problem size, so it is reasonably straightforward to determine
how many processors should be allocated to execute a regular algorithm of a
certain size (this is called the processor allocation problem). In contrast,
parallelism in irregular algorithms can be a function of input parameters, and
the amount of parallelism can vary dramatically during the execution of the
irregular algorithm. Therefore, the processor allocation problem for irregular
algorithms is very difficult.
  In this paper, we describe the first systematic strategy for addressing this
problem. Our approach is based on a construct called the conflict graph, which
(i) provides insight into the amount of parallelism that can be extracted from
an irregular algorithm, and (ii) can be used to address the processor
allocation problem for irregular algorithms. We show that this problem is
related to a generalization of the unfriendly seating problem and, by extending
Tur\'an's theorem, we obtain a worst-case class of problems for optimistic
parallelization, which we use to derive a lower bound on the exploitable
parallelism. Finally, using some theoretically derived properties and some
experimental facts, we design a quick and stable control strategy for solving
the processor allocation problem heuristically.

exploit communication latency-hiding techniques seamlessly. For compiled
languages, it is often possible to create efficient schedules for
communication, but this is not the case for interpreted languages. By
maintaining data dependencies between scheduled operations, it is possible to
aggressively initiate communication and lazily evaluate tasks to allow maximal
time for the communication to finish before entering a wait state. We implement
a heuristic of this model in DistNumPy, an auto-parallelizing version of
numerical Python that allows sequential NumPy programs to run on distributed

benchmarks with and without automatic latency-hiding. The results shows that
our model reduces the time spent on waiting for communication as much as 27

this correlation is not universal when one combines predictions from a host of
different models. By averaging over these model predictions, we provide
estimates with associated systematic errors for rskin and alphad for the nuclei

field produced by this ""dark repulsor"" can explain the anomalous motion of the
Local Sheet away from the Local Void, as well as several other properties of
nearby galaxies that seem to require void evacuation and structure formation
much faster than expected from the standard model. At the global cosmological
level, gravitational repulsion from antimatter hidden in voids can provide more
than enough potential energy to drive both the cosmic expansion and its
acceleration, with no need for an initial ""explosion"" and dark energy.
Moreover, the discrete distribution of these dark repulsors, in contrast to the
uniformly permeating dark energy, can also explain dark flows and other
recently observed excessive inhomogeneities and anisotropies of the Universe.

observational determinations of the white dwarf initial-final mass relation.
Nevertheless, definitive and detailed observational confirmations of the
mass-radius relation (MRR) remain elusive due to a lack of sufficiently
accurate white dwarf masses and radii. Current best estimates of masses and
radii allow only broad conclusions about the expected inverse relation between
masses and radii in degenerate stars. In this paper we examine a restricted set
of 12 DA white dwarf binary systems for which accurate (1) trigonometric
parallaxes, (2) spectroscopic effective temperatures and gravities, and (3)
gravitational redshifts are available. We consider these three independent
constraints on mass and radius in comparison with an appropriate evolved MRR
for each star. For the best-determined systems it is found that the DA white
dwarfs conform to evolved theoretical MRRs at the 1-{\sigma} to 2-{\sigma}
level. For the white dwarf 40 Eri B (WD0413-077) we find strong evidence for
the existence of a ""thin"" hydrogen envelope. For other stars improved
parallaxes will be necessary before meaningful comparisons are possible. For
several systems current parallaxes approach the precision required for the

and solves the problem with the Lanczos algorithm. The method has been tested
with the photoabsorption cross sections of the free Xe atom and C$_{60}$
fullerene. The result for the Xe@C$_{60}$ confirms the three main peaks
observed in the recent measurement in the energy region of the Xe 4$d$ giant
resonance and demonstrates the underestimation of the photoionization cross
section by the experiment. It is suggested to use the current theoretical
result around 22 eV to calibrate the experimental data.

matrix when the data is dependent in time. More precisely, the dependence for
each variable $i=1,...,p$ is modelled as a linear process
$(X_{i,t})_{t=1,...,n}=(\sum_{j=0}^\infty c_j Z_{i,t-j})_{t=1,...,n}$, where
$\{Z_{i,t}\}$ are assumed to be independent random variables with finite fourth
moments. If the sample size $n$ and the number of variables $p=p_n$ both
converge to infinity such that $y=\lim_{n\to\infty}{n/p_n}>0$, then the
empirical spectral distribution of $p^{-1}\X\X^T$ converges to a
non\hyp{}random distribution which only depends on $y$ and the spectral density
of $(X_{1,t})_{t\in\Z}$. In particular, our results apply to (fractionally
integrated) ARMA processes, which we illustrate by some examples.

finite infinite-dimensional complex Lie algebras. In particular we investigate
the annihilators of the simple objects in the category of tensor modules. This
category has been studied in \cite{PStyr} and \cite{PS}. Moreover we prove that
a simple tensor module is completely determined by its annihilator and we
introduce a partial order on pairs of Young diagrams that we use to describe
the inclusions between the annihilators of the simple tensor modules.

friction, for a pair of particles of low relative particle velocity. Each
particle is modeled as a simple harmonic oscillator. Our basic method, as
before, is the use of quantum mechanical statistical mechanics, involving the
Kubo formula, at finite temperature. In this work we begin by analyzing the
Casimir friction between two particles polarizable in all spatial directions,
this being a generalization of our study in EPL 91, 60003 (2010), which was
restricted to a pair of particles with longitudinal polarization only. For
simplicity the particles are taken to interact via the electrostatic
dipole-dipole interaction. Thereafter, we consider the Casimir friction between
one particle and a dielectric half-space, and also the friction between two
dielectric half-spaces. Finally, we consider general polarizabilities (beyond
the simple one-oscillator form), and show how friction occurs at finite
temperature when finite frequency regions of the imaginary parts of
polarizabilities overlap.

RN-representations, allowing an un-biased rounding-to-nearest to take place by
a simple truncation. In this paper we briefly review the binary fixed-point
representation in an encoding which is essentially an ordinary 2's complement
representation with an appended round-bit. Not only is this rounding a constant
time operation, so is also sign inversion, both of which are at best log-time
operations on ordinary 2's complement representations. Addition, multiplication
and division is defined in such a way that rounding information can be carried
along in a meaningful way, at minimal cost. Based on the fixed-point encoding
we here define a floating point representation, and describe to some detail a
possible implementation of a floating point arithmetic unit employing this
representation, including also the directed roundings.

called compressive sensing via Bayesian support detection (CS-BSD). This
algorithm is quite robust against measurement noise and achieves the
performance of a minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator that has support
knowledge beyond a certain SNR threshold. The key idea behind CS-BSD is that
reconstruction takes a detection-directed estimation structure consisting of
two parts: support detection and signal value estimation. Belief propagation
(BP) and a Bayesian hypothesis test perform support detection, and an MMSE
estimator finds the signal values belonging to the support set. CS-BSD
converges faster than other BP-based algorithms, and it can be converted to a
parallel architecture to become much faster. Numerical results are provided to
verify the superiority of CS-BSD compared to recent algorithms.
