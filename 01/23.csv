codata. Specifically, we present a direct Bellantoni-Cook-style normal/safe
typed programming formalism, RS1, that expresses feasible structural recursions
and corecursions over data and codata specified by polynomial functors. (Lists,
streams, finite trees, infinite trees, etc. are all directly definable.) A
novel aspect of RS1 is that it embraces structure-sharing as in standard
functional-programming implementations. As our data representations use
sharing, our implementation of structural recursions are memoized to avoid the
possibly exponentially-many repeated subcomputations a naive implementation
might perform. We introduce notions of size for representations of data
(accounting for sharing) and codata (using ideas from type-2 computational
complexity) and establish that type-level 1 RS1-functions have
polynomial-bounded runtimes and satisfy a polynomial-time completeness
condition. Also, restricting RS1 terms to particular types produces
characterizations of some standard complexity classes (e.g., omega-regular
languages, linear-space functions) and some less-standard classes (e.g.,
log-space streams).

3-brane is anisotropically warped along its spatial dimensions and contains a
novel time-dependent scale factor that multiplies the anisotropic spatial
interval of the 5D metric, a fact that allows us to study cosmological effects.
By explicitly solving the bulk field equations we found a natural mechanism
which isotropizes the braneworld for a wide class of natural initial
conditions. We are able to give a physical interpretation of the anisotropic
dissipation: as the anisotropic energy of the 3-brane rapidly leaks into the
bulk through the nontrivial components of the projected to the brane non-local
Weyl tensor, the bulk becomes less isotropic. At the same time, under the
action of the 4D cosmological constant, the anisotropic braneworld
super-exponentially isotropizes by itself, rendering a 3-brane with de Sitter
symmetry embedded in a 5D de Sitter space-time, while the phantom scalar field
exponentially vanishes.

harmonic-oscillator trapping potential applied in the transverse plane. The
lattice can be created as an optical or magnetic one, by means of available
experimental techniques. The objective is to identify stable 3D solitons
supported by the setting. Two methods are developed for this purpose: The
variational approximation, formulated in the framework of the 3D
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, and the 1D nonpolynomial Schr\""{o}dinger equation
(NPSE) in the axial direction, which allows one to predict the collapse in the
framework of the 1D description. Results are summarized in the form of a
stability region for the solitons in the plane of the NL strength and
wavenumber. Both methods produce a similar form of the stability region. Unlike
their counterparts supported by the NL in the 1D model with the cubic
nonlinearity, kicked solitons of the NPSE cannot be set in motion, but the kick
may help to stabilize them against the collapse, by causing the solitons to
shed excess norm. A dynamical effect specific to the NL is found in the form of
freely propagating small-amplitude wave packets emitted by perturbed solitons.

the one-dimensional Berry-Esseen theorem, (d) the one-dimensional first-order

transverse momentum-dependent gluon mass term, leading to a propagator of the

variation in malaria which incorporates multiple epitopes and both long-lasting
and transient immune responses. We show that in the case of a vanishing decay
rate for the long-lasting immune response, the system exhibits the so-called
""bifurcations without parameters"" due to the existence of a hypersurface of
equilibria in the phase space. When the decay rate of the long-lasting immune
response is different from zero, the hypersurface of equilibria degenerates,
and a multitude of other steady states are born, many of which are related by a
permutation symmetry of the system. The robustness of the fully symmetric state
of the system was investigated by means of numerical computation of transverse
Lyapunov exponents. The results of this exercise indicate that for a vanishing
decay of long-lasting immune response, the fully symmetric state is not robust
in the substantial part of the parameter space, and instead all variants
develop their own temporal dynamics contributing to the overall time evolution.
At the same time, if the decay rate of the long-lasting immune response is
increased, the fully symmetric state can become robust provided the growth rate
of the long-lasting immune response is rapid.

stellar velocity dispersion, {\sigma}, during dissipationless binary mergers of
galaxies. Stellar velocity dispersion was measured using the common
mass-weighting method as well as a flux-weighting method designed to simulate
the technique used by observers. A toy model for dust attenuation was
introduced in order to study the effect of dust attenuation on measurements of
{\sigma}. We found that there are three principal stages in the evolution of
{\sigma} in such mergers: oscillation, phase mixing, and dynamical equilibrium.
During the oscillation stage, {\sigma} undergoes damped oscillations of
increasing frequency. The oscillation stage is followed by a phase mixing stage
during which the amplitude of the variations in {\sigma} is smaller and more
chaotic than in the oscillation stage. Upon reaching dynamical equilibrium,
{\sigma} assumes a stable value. We used our data regarding the evolution of
{\sigma} during mergers to characterize the scatter inherent in making
measurements of {\sigma} in non-quiescent systems. In particular, we found that
{\sigma} does not fall below 70% nor exceed 200% of its final, quiescent value
during a merger and that a random measurement of {\sigma} in such a system is
much more likely to fall near the equilibrium value than near an extremum. Our
toy model of dust attenuation suggested that dust can systematically reduce
observational measurements of {\sigma} and increase the scatter in {\sigma}
measurements.

the challenge of exploring a wide interval to look for the usual signatures

broad range quest is that the significance calculations valid for signals of
known location are no more applicable when such an information is missing. This
circumstance is commonly termed in high energy physics applications as the look
elsewhere effect. How it concretely manifests in a specific problem of signal
search depends upon the particular strategy adopted to unravel the sought-after
signal from the underlying background. In this respect an increasingly popular
method is the profile likelihood ratio, especially because of its asymptotic
behavior dictated by one of the most famous statistic result, the Wilks'
theorem. This work is centered on the description of the look elsewhere effect
in the framework of the profile likelihood methodology, in particular proposing
a conjecture about the distribution of the likelihood ratio under the null

an $\epsi$-dependent classical Hamilton function and an $\varepsilon$-dependent
symplectic form, has a concrete mathematical and physical meaning: Based on
this flow we prove a formula for equilibrium expectations, an Egorov theorem
and transport of Wigner functions, thereby approximating properties of the
quantum system up to errors of order $\varepsilon^2$. In the context of Bloch

neutron star constitute the majority of individually detectable sources for
future low-frequency space-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories; they
also form an unresolved continuum, the dominant Galactic foreground at
frequencies below a few mHz. Due to the paucity of electromagnetic
observations, the majority of studies of Galactic-binary populations so far
have been based on population-synthesis simulations. However, recent surveys
have reported several new detections of white-dwarf binaries, providing new
constraints for population estimates. In this article, we evaluate the impact
of revised local densities of interacting white-dwarf binaries on future GW
observations. Specifically: we consider five scenarios that explain these
densities with different assumptions on the formation of interacting systems;
we simulate corresponding populations of detached and interacting white-dwarf
binaries; we estimate the number of individually detectable GW sources and the
magnitude of the confusion-noise foreground, as observed by space-based
detectors with 5- and 1-Mkm arms. We confirm earlier estimates of thousands of
detached-binary detections, but project only few ten to few hundred detections
of interacting systems. This reduction is partly due to our assessment of
detection prospects, based on the iterative identification and subtraction of
bright sources with respect to both instrument and confusion noise. We also
confirm earlier estimates for the confusion-noise foreground, except in one
scenario that explains smaller local densities of interacting systems with
smaller numbers of progenitor detached systems.

To recover a (nearly) sparse vector $x^0$, minimizing

$||x||_1$ almost whenever $\alpha\ge 10||x^0||_\infty$. The same relation also

linear convergence as long as a nonzero solution exists, and we give an

than the canonical 1.5 Mo. This result relies on the assumption that the
amplitude of the optical component's measured radial velocity curve is not
seriously affected by the interactions in the system. In this paper we explore
the effect on the radial velocity curve caused by surface motions excited by
tidal interactions. We use a calculation from first principles that involves
solving the equations of motion of a Lagrangian grid of surface elements. The
velocities on the visible surface of the star are projected along the
line-of-sight to the observer to obtain the absorption-line profile in the
observer's reference frame. The centroid of the line-profiles for different
orbital phases is then measured and a simulated RV curve constructed. Models
are run for the ""standard"" (vsini=116 km/s) and ""slow"" (56 km/s) supergiant
rotation velocities. We find that the surface velocity field is complex and
includes fast, small-spatial scale structures. It leads to strong variability
in the photospheric line profiles which, in turn, causes significant deviations
from a Keplerian RV curve. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of model RV curves are
in all cases larger than the amplitude of the orbital motion. Keplerian fits to
RV curves obtained with the ""standard"" rotation velocity imply a neutron star
>1.7 Mo. However, a similar analysis of the ""slow"" rotational velocity models
allows for m_ns ~ 1.5 Mo. Thus, the stellar rotation plays an important role in
determining the characteristics of the perturbed RV curve. Given the
observational uncertainty in GP Vel's projected rotation velocity and the
strong perturbations seen in the published and the model RV curves, we are
unable to rule out a small (~1.5 Mo) mass for the neutron star companion.

perturbations are different from those obtained in general relativity, because
of the presence of the high-order spatial derivative terms. Applied the general
formulas to a single scalar field, we show that in the sub-horizon regions, the
metric and scalar field are tightly coupled and have the same oscillating
frequencies. In the super-horizon regions, the perturbations become adiabatic,
and the comoving curvature perturbation is constant. We also calculate the
power spectra and indices of both the scalar and tensor perturbations, and
express them explicitly in terms of the slow roll parameters and the coupling
constants of the high-order spatial derivative terms. In particular, we find
that the perturbations, of both scalar and tensor, are almost scale-invariant,
and the spectrum indices are the same as those given in GR, but the ratio of
the scalar and tensor power spectra depends on the high-order spatial

spin-orbit interactions. It has been shown that any one of the spin-orbit
fields can be estimated precisely if the other one is known, by observing
either the transmission resonance or anti-resonance of unpolarized electrons.
The result is obtained through an exact analytic calculation for a simple
square loop, and through a numerically exact formulation for a circular ring.

transiting extrasolar planet, HD209458b, allowed the discovery that this planet
has an extended atmosphere of escaping hydrogen. Subsequent observations showed
the presence of oxygen and carbon at very high altitude. These observations
give unique constraints on the escape rate and mechanism in the atmosphere of
hot-Jupiters. The most recent Lyman-alpha HST observations of HD189733b and
MgII observations of Wasp-12b allow for the first time comparison of the
evaporation from different planets in different environments. Models to
quantify the escape rate from the measured occultation depths, and an energy
diagram to describe the evaporation state of hot-Jupiters are presented. Using
this diagram, it is shown that few already known planets like GJ876d or

taken to solve these two problems during the last few years. First, one can

were major changes in rank. In addition, the SJR2 was distributed more
equalized than the JIF by Subject Area and almost as equalized as the SNIP, and
better than both at the lower level of Specific Subject Areas. The

same for all individuals. We then generalize the solution to deal with
heterogeneous populations, biased search procedures for the suspect,
$\Gamma$-correlations, uncertainty about the subpopulation of the criminal and

the effect of the way the search for $S$ is conducted, in particular when this
is done by a database search. A returning theme is that we show that
conditioning is of importance when one wants to quantify the ""weight"" of the

discuss the practical problems in applying these issues to the legal process.
The posterior probabilities of $C=S$ are typically the same for all reasonable
choices of the hypotheses, but this is not the whole story. The legal process
might force one to dismiss certain hypotheses, for instance when the relevant

in the design of finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters. The eigenvalues
of this matrix shed light on the FIR filter design, so obtaining them in closed
form was investigated. Zhang \emph{et al.}\ proved that their matrix had rank-4
and they conjectured closed form expressions for its eigenvalues, leaving a
rigorous proof as an open problem. This paper studies trigonometric matrices
significantly more general than theirs, deduces their rank, and derives
closed-forms for their eigenvalues. As a corollary, it yields a short proof of
the conjectures in the aforementioned paper.

long-term vision of designing functional materials with tailored molecular

systems where truly molecular conduction pathways play a fundamental role. Such
pathways can be formed due to the molecular organization of various organic
materials and are widely used to discuss electronic properties at the nanometer
scale. Here, we present a computational methodology to study charge propagation
in organic molecular stacks at nano and sub-nanoscales and exploit this
methodology to demonstrate that moving charge carriers strongly affect the
values of the physical quantities controlling their motion. The approach is
also expected to find broad application in the field of charge migration in

model selection which is based on a series of steps consisting of selecting
specific features, such as the number of latent dimensions, the number of

formation, plasma condensation, and evolution of solar prominences. Unstable
thermal modes due to unbalance between radiative losses and heating can lead to
rapid plasma cooling and condensation. An accurate description of the radiative
loss function is therefore crucial for this process. Aims: We study the
stability of thermal modes in unbounded and uniform plasmas with properties
akin to those in solar prominences. Effects due to partial ionization are taken
into account. Three different parametrizations of the radiative loss function
are used. Methods: By means of a normal mode analysis, we investigate linear
nonadiabatic perturbations superimposed on the equilibrium state. We find an
approximate instability criterion for thermal modes, while the exact linear
growth rate is obtained by numerically solving the general dispersion relation.
The stability of thermal disturbances is compared for the three different loss
functions considered. Results: Using up-to-date computations of radiative
losses derived from the CHIANTI atomic database, we find that thermal modes may
be unstable in prominences for lower temperatures than those predicted with
previously existing loss functions. Thermal instability can take place for
temperatures as low as 15,000 K, approximately. The obtained linear growth
rates indicate that this instability might have an important impact on the
dynamics and evolution of cool prominence condensations.

several supernova remnants (SNR) associated with molecular clouds. If the gamma
rays are produced mainly by hadronic processes rather than leptonic processes
like bremsstrahlung, then the flux of energetic cosmic ray (CR) nuclei (>1 GeV)
required to produce the gamma rays can be inferred at the site where the
particles are accelerated in SNR shocks. It is of great interest to understand
the acceleration of the CR of lower energy (<1 GeV) accompanying the energetic
component. These particles of lower energy are most effective in ionizing
interstellar gas, leaving an observable imprint on the interstellar ion
chemistry. A correlation of energetic gamma radiation with enhanced
interstellar ionization can thus support the hadronic origin of the gamma rays
and constrain the acceleration of ionizing CR in SNR. We propose a method to
test the hadronic origin of GeV gamma rays from SNR associated with a molecular
cloud. We use observational gamma ray data for each of these SNR known,
modeling the observations to obtain the underlying proton spectrum assuming
that the gamma rays are produced by pion decay. Assuming that the acceleration
mechanism does not only produce high energy protons, but also low energy
protons, this proton spectrum at the source is then used to calculate the
ionization rate of the molecular cloud. Ionized molecular hydrogen triggers a
chemical network forming molecular ions. The relaxation of these ions results
in characteristic line emission, which can be predicted. We show that the
ionization rate for at least two objects is more than an order of magnitude
above Galactic average for molecular clouds, hinting at an enhanced formation
rate of molecular ions. There will be interesting opportunities to measure
crucial molecular ions in the infrared and submillimeter-wave parts of the
spectrum.

Rashba- and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. The transverse confinement is
modeled by means of a parabolic potential. An orbital effect of the in-plane
magnetic field is shown to mix a transverse quantized spin-up state with
nearest-neighboring spin-down states. The out-off-plane component of the
equilibrium spin current appears to be not zero in the presence of an in-plane
magnetic field, provided at least two transverse-quantized levels are filled.
In the absence of the magnetic field the obtained results coincide with the
well-known results, yielding cubic dependence of the equilibrium spin current
on the spin-orbit coupling constants. The persistent spin-current vanishes in
the absence of the magnetic field if Rashba- and Dresselhaus spin-orbit
coefficients,{\alpha} and {\beta}, are equal each other. In-plane magnetic
field destroys this symmetry, and accumulates a finite spin-current as {\alpha}
\rightarrow {\beta}. Magnetic field is shown to change strongly the equilibrium
current of the in-plane spin components, and gives new contributions to the
cubic-dependent on spin-orbit constants terms. These new terms depend linearly
on the spin-orbit constants.

sources of error in the `initiator' adaptation to Full Configuration
Interaction Quantum Monte Carlo (i-FCIQMC), with a view to accelerating
convergence. In particular we find that the fixed shift phase, where the walker
number is allowed to grow slowly, can be used to effectively assess stochastic
and initiator error. Using this approach we provide simple explanations for the
internal parameters of an i-FCIQMC simulation. We exploit the consistent basis
sets and adjustable correlation strength of the HEG to analyze properties of
the algorithm, and present finite basis benchmark energies for N=14 over a
range of densities $0.5 \leq r_s \leq 5.0$ a.u. A \emph{single-point
extrapolation} scheme is introduced to produce complete basis energies for 14,
38 and 54 electrons. It is empirically found that, in the weakly correlated
regime, the computational cost scales linearly with the plane wave basis set
size, which is justifiable on physical grounds. We expect the fixed shift
strategy to reduce the computational cost of many \iFCIQMC calculations of
weakly correlated systems. In addition, we provide benchmarks for the electron
gas, to be used by other quantum chemical methods in exploring periodic solid
state systems.

(TS) and total body length of the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata), in order
to monitor its growth in sea cages. Five classes of commercial size gilthead
sea bream are characterized, comprising lengths from 20 to 25 cm, corresponding
to weights between 160 and 270 g. A few specimens were introduced into a sea
cage of 3 m in diameter and a height of 2.7 m. We measure TS directly using a
Simrad EK60 echosounder with a 7^{\circ} split-beam transducer working at 200
kHz. The transducer was located in the center of the cage during measurements,
at the bottom facing upwards for ventral recordings and on the surface facing
downwards to perform dorsal recordings. Two analyses based on single echo
detection were performed: the first one obtains compensated transducer
directivity TS values from intensity and angular echosounder data; while the
second one omit phase information, affording uncompensated TS values (TSu). Two
algorithms have been applied to analyze single-beam-like data, that differ in
the order in which threshold and echo length criteria are applied to detect
single echoes. TS distributions obtained from the split-beam analysis are
unimodal for both ventral and dorsal measurements, like TSu distributions
obtained when the threshold criterion is applied first. A lineal relationship
was found between mean TS for the ventral aspect and logarithm of total body
length of fish, showing good correlations for both TS and TSu, even having a
few detections. Note that the relationship between TSu and total body length
allows monitoring the growth of gilthead sea bream using low cost equipment
like single beam echosounders.

emerge as Goldstone bosons of a global SO(D) X GL(D) symmetry broken down to

particular space-time metric and only assumes the pre-existence of a manifold
endowed with an affine connection. We emphasize that not even a flat metric
needs to be assumed; in this sense the microscopic theory is quasi-topological.
The vierbein appears as a condensate of the fundamental fermions. In spite of
having non-standard characteristics, the microscopic theory appears to be
renormalizable. The effective long-distance theory is obtained perturbatively
around a vacuum that, if the background affine connection is set to zero, is
(euclidean) de Sitter space-time. If perturbatively small connections are
introduced on this background, fluctuations of the metric (i.e. gravitons)
appear; they are described by an effective theory at long distances whose more
relevant operators correspond to the Einstein-Hilbert action with a
cosmological constant. This effective action is derived in the large N limit, N
being the number of fermion species in the fundamental theory. The counterterms
required by the microscopic theory are directly related to the cosmological
constant and Newton constant and their couplings could eventually be adjusted
to the physical values of Mp and \Lambda.

show theoretically and we provide definitive experimental verification that an

to slide strongly affects buckling loads and can induce: (i.) tensile buckling;
(ii.) decreasing- (softening), increasing- (hardening), or constant-load (null

for instance two bifurcation loads (one tensile and one compressive) in a

absorption features in the energy spectra. Absorption is however expected due
to pair-production processes of the propagating photons with the photon bath in
intergalactic space. Even though this photon density is not well known, lower
limits can be firmly set by the resolved emission from galaxy counts. Using
this guaranteed background light, we investigate the behaviour of the energy
spectra in the transition region from the optically thin to the optically thick
regime. Among the sample of 50 energy spectra, 7 spectra cover the the range
from optical depth $\tau < 1$ to $\tau > 2$. For these sources, the transition
to $\tau > 2$ takes place at widely different energies ranging from 0.4 TeV to
21 TeV. Consistently, in all of these sources, an upturn of the
absorption-corrected spectrum is visible at this transition with a combined
significance of 4.2 standard deviations. Given the broad range of energies and
redshifts covered by the sample, source-intrinsic features are unlikely to
explain the observed effect. Systematic effects related to observations have
been investigated and found to be not sufficient to account for the observed
effect. The pair-production process seems to be suppressed in a similar way as
expected in the extension of the standard model by a light (<neV) pseudoscalar
(axion-like) particle.

than expected from smooth winds with conventional mass-loss rates. Various
solutions have been proposed, including porous winds, optically thick clumps or
an overall reduction of the mass-loss rates. The latter has a strong impact on
the evolution of the star. Our final goal is to analyse high resolution X-ray
spectra of O-type stars with a multi temperature plasma model in order to
determine crucial wind parameters such as the mass loss rate, the CNO
abundances and the X-ray temperature plasma distribution in the wind. In this
context we are developing a modelling tool to calculate synthetic X-ray
spectra. We present, here, the main ingredients and physics necessary for a
such work. Our code uses the AtomDB emissivities to compute the intrinsic
emissivity of the hot plasma as well as the CMFGEN model atmosphere code to
evaluate the opacity of the cool wind. Following the comparison between two
formalisms of stellar wind fragmentation, we introduce, for the first time in
X-rays, the effects of a tenuous inter-clump medium. We then explore the
quantitative impact of different model parameters on the X-ray spectra such as
the position in the wind of the X-ray emitting plasma. For the first time, we
show that the two formalisms of stellar wind fragmentation yield different
results, although the differences for individual lines are small and can
probably not be tested with the current generation of X-ray telescopes. As an
illustration of our method, we compare various synthetic line profiles to the
observed O VIII {\lambda} 18.97{\AA} line in the spectrum of {\zeta} Puppis. We
illustrate how different combinations of parameters can actually lead to the
same morphology of a single line, underlining the need to analyse the whole

defined a class of analytically tractable coordinated optimization models and
solved representative examples in which a spatially complex organization of the
orientation preference map is induced by inter-map interactions. We found that
attractor solutions near symmetry breaking threshold predict a highly ordered
map layout and require a substantial OD bias for OP pinwheel stabilization.
Here we examine in numerical simulations whether such models exhibit
biologically more realistic spatially irregular solutions at a finite distance
from threshold and when transients towards attractor states are considered. We
also examine whether model behavior qualitatively changes when the spatial
periodicities of the two maps are detuned and when considering more than 2
feature dimensions. Our numerical results support the view that neither minimal
energy states nor intermediate transient states of our coordinated optimization
models successfully explain the spatially irregular architecture of the visual

ascribes inflation to a spontaneous breakdown of conformal symmetry, followed
by a sudden energy transfer from geometry to matter identified as big bang.
This process is driven by a conformal-invariant, unitarity-preserving
interaction of two Nambu-Goldstone fields: a ghost scalar field $\sigma$,
invested with geometric meaning, and a physical scalar field $\varphi$ behaving
like a Higgs field of varying mass. The big bang generates a bulk of Higgs
bosons at temperature $T_B\simeq 141$ GeV, after which the universe evolves
adiabatically while the Higgs bosons decay into Standard-Model particles and
the magnitude of the gravitational coupling constant decreases. The process
ends when the $\sigma$-$\varphi$ interaction potential vanishes, the amplitudes
of these fields converge to their expectation values in a final stable vacuum
and the Higgs-boson mass converges to about 126 GeV. The main aspects of this
phenomenology are qualitatively described and accurately exemplified by
numerical simulations. The combination of CGR gravitational equation at time
zero with entropy conservation equation results in striking predictions. The
best fit to astronomic data is obtained from only standard Higgs boson
parameters and a universe age of 19.5 Gyr. The cosmological constant
$\Lambda\simeq 1.35\times 10^{-35}$s$^{-2}$, the scale factor across inflation
$Z\simeq 4.54\times 10^{27}$, and the lower bound of the power spectrum of
cosmic background anisotropies $W_{min}\!\simeq 37.5\,\mu$K$^2$ are thus
predicted.
