exhaustive search has retained its significance since many real-life problems
exhibit no regular structure and exhaustive search is the only possible
solution. The advent of high-performance computing either via multicore
processors or distributed processors emphasizes the possibility for exhaustive
search by multiple search agents. Here we analyse the performance of exhaustive
search when it is conducted by multiple search agents. Several strategies for
cooperation between the search agents are evaluated. We discover that the
performance of the search improves with the increase in the level of
cooperation. Same search performance can be achieved with homogeneous and
heterogeneous search agents provided that the length of subregions allocated to
individual search regions follow the differences in the speeds of heterogeneous
search agents.

analytical filter, the Biparametric Adaptive Filter (BAF), that is able to
adapt itself to the statistical properties of the background as well as to the
profile of the compact sources, maximizing the amplification and improving the
detection process. We have tested the performance of this filter using
realistic simulations of the microwave sky between 30 and 857 GHz as observed
by the Planck satellite, where complex backgrounds can be found. We demonstrate
that doing a local analysis on flat patches allows one to find a combination of
the optimal scale of the filter R and the index of the filter g that will
produce a global maximum in the amplification, enhancing the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of the detected sources in the filtered map and improving the total
number of detections above a threshold. We conclude that the new filter is able
to improve the overall performance of the MHW2, increasing the SNR of the
detections and, therefore, the number of detections above a 5 sigma threshold.
The improvement of the new filter in terms of SNR is particularly important in
the vicinity of the galactic plane and in the presence of strong galactic
emission. Finally, we compare the sources detected by each method and find that
the new filter is able to detect more new sources than the MHW2 at all

spurious detections, associated to compact structures in the vicinity of the

high-dimensional asymptotic regime. Simulation studies and an application in

criticisms regarding p-values have arisen in the scientific literature. The
main issue is that in general optimal p-values (based on likelihood ratio
statistics) are not measures of evidence over the parameter space $\Theta$.
Here, we propose an \emph{objective} measure of evidence for very general null
hypotheses that satisfies logical requirements (i.e., operations on the subsets

We study the proposed measure in the light of the abstract belief calculus

belief on the subsets of $\Theta$. Based on its properties, we strongly
recommend this measure as an additional summary of significance tests. At the

dealing with budget-constrained agents. A desirable goal in practice is to
design incentive compatible, individually rational, and Pareto optimal auctions
while respecting the budget constraints. Achieving this goal is particularly
challenging in the presence of nontrivial combinatorial constraints over the
set of feasible allocations.
  Toward this goal and motivated by AdWords auctions, we present an auction for
{\em polymatroidal} environments satisfying the above properties. Our auction
employs a novel clinching technique with a clean geometric description and only
needs an oracle access to the submodular function defining the polymatroid. As
a result, this auction not only simplifies and generalizes all previous
results, it applies to several new applications including AdWords Auctions,
bandwidth markets, and video on demand. In particular, our characterization of
the AdWords auction as polymatroidal constraints might be of independent
interest. This allows us to design the first mechanism for Ad Auctions taking
into account simultaneously budgets, multiple keywords and multiple slots.
  We show that it is impossible to extend this result to generic polyhedral
constraints. This also implies an impossibility result for multi-unit auctions
with decreasing marginal utilities in the presence of budget constraints.

finding is that although the structure of the winning strategies in games of
CIS-Nim can differ greatly from that of Nim, CIS-Nim games inherit a type of
period-two scale invariance from the original game of Nim.

The brightest blobs show the highest speed. The widths of the H-alpha line
emission of the blobs correspond to non-thermal velocities in the plasma less

separately encoded (using codes of fixed rate) and transmitted over two
independent binary memoryless symmetric channels. The capacity of each channel
is characterized by a single parameter which is not known at the transmitter.
The goal is to design systems that retain near-optimal performance without
channel knowledge at the transmitter.
  It was conjectured that it may be hard to design codes that perform well for
symmetric channel conditions. In this work, we present a provable
capacity-achieving sequence of LDGM ensembles for the erasure Slepian-Wolf
problem with symmetric channel conditions. We also introduce a staggered
structure which enables codes optimized for single user channels to perform
well for symmetric channel conditions.
  We provide a generic framework for analyzing the performance of joint
iterative decoding, using density evolution. Using differential evolution, we
design punctured systematic LDPC codes to maximize the region of achievable
channel conditions. The resulting codes are then staggered to further increase
the region of achievable parameters. The main contribution of this paper is to
demonstrate that properly designed irregular LDPC codes can perform well
simultaneously over a wide range of channel parameters.

efficiently to maximize their use. A sensor's battery is a crucial resource as
it singly determines the lifetime of sensor network applications. Since these
devices are useful only when they are able to communicate with the world, radio
transceiver of a sensor as an I/O and a costly unit plays a key role in its
lifetime. This resource often consumes a big portion of the sensor's energy as
it must be active most of the time to announce the existence of the sensor in
the network. As such the radio component has to deal with its embedded sensor
network whose parameters and operations have significant effects on the
sensor's lifetime. In existing energy models, hardware is considered, but the
environment and the network's parameters did not receive adequate attention.
Energy consumption components of traditional network architecture are often
considered individually and separately, and their influences on each other have
not been considered in these approaches. In this paper we consider all possible
tasks of a sensor in its embedded network and propose an energy management
model. We categorize these tasks in five energy consuming constituents. The
sensor's Energy Consumption (EC) is modeled on its energy consuming
constituents and their input parameters and tasks. The sensor's EC can thus be
reduced by managing and executing efficiently the tasks of its constituents.
The proposed approach can be effective for power management, and it also can be
used to guide the design of energy efficient wireless sensor networks through
network parameterization and optimization.

expected to help in understanding this issue. To that end, we employed a
direct-reverse impact technique and velocity interferometry to determine sound

measured longitudinal sound velocities show an obvious kink at ~60 GPa as a
function of shock pressure, while the bulk sound velocities show no
discontinuity. Such observation could result from a structural transformation
associated with a negligible volume change or an electronic topological
transition.

QSOs with the 2m telescope at IUCAA Girawali observatory (IGO). The broad Mg II
absorption with an ejection velocity of 1.7x10^4 km/s, found in the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectra, has disappeared completely in our IGO

in our latest observations. Acceleration of a low velocity component seen in

are always observed to be higher for the new component. We argue that the
observed variations may not be related to ionization changes and are consistent
with absorption produced by multi-streaming flow transiting across our line of

proposed to investigate the link failure problem from network coding. A
capacity factor (CF) of a network is an edge set, deleting which will cause the
maximum flow to decrease while deleting any proper subset will not. Generally,
a $k$-CF is a minimal (not minimum) edge set which will cause the network
maximum flow decrease by $k$.
  Under point to point acyclic scenario, we characterize all the edges which
are contained in some CF, and propose an efficient algorithm to classify. And
we show that all edges on some $s$-$t$ path in an acyclic point-to-point
acyclic network are contained in some 2-CF. We also study some other properties
of CF of point to point network, and a simple relationship with CF in multicast
network.
  On the other hand, some computational hardness results relating to capacity
factors are obtained. We prove that deciding whether there is a capacity factor
of a cyclic network with size not less a given number is NP-complete, and the
time complexity of calculating the capacity rank is lowered bounded by solving
the maximal flow. Besides that, we propose the analogous definition of CF on
vertices and show it captures edge capacity factors as a special case.

shown the variation of the square of speed of sound ($c_{s}^{2}$) for the HG

ratio ($\eta/s$) in HG as well as in QGP phases separately with respect to
temperature at different baryonic chemical potential ($\mu_{B}$). The presence
of a cusp like structure in $\eta/s$ again confirms the existence of CP on the

nanoparticles. Two dielectric relaxations culminating around the magnetic
transitions were observed with a maximum magnetodielectric response reaching
10% and 8% at the respective relaxation peaks measured at 100 kHz under 5T
magnetic field. The dc electrical resistivity followed an insulating behavior
and showed a negative magnetoresistance; there was no noticeable anomaly in
resistivity or magnetoresistance near the magnetic ordering temperatures.
Complex impedance analysis revealed a clear intrinsic contribution to the
magnetodielectric response; however, extrinsic contribution due to
Maxwell-Wagner effect combined with magnetoresistance property dominated the
magnetodielectric effect at high temperatures.

distribution of scatterers in space. The scatterers are often assumed to be
spherical with a fixed diameter $d$, and the point particles move with constant
velocity between the scatterers, and are specularly reflected when hitting a
scatterer. There is no interaction between point particles. An interesting
question concerns the distribution of free path lengths, i.e. the distance a
point particle moves between the scattering events, and how this distribution
scales with scatterer diameter, scatterer density and the distribution of the
scatterers. It is by now well known that in the so-called Boltzmann-Grad limit,
a Poisson distribution of scatters leads to an exponential distribution of free
path lengths, whereas if the scatterer distribution is periodic, the
distribution of free path behaves asymptotically like a Cauchy distribution.
  This paper considers the case when the scatters are distributed on a quasi
crystal, i.e. non periodically, but with a long range order. Simulations of a
one-dimensional model are presented, showing that the quasi crystal behaves
very much like a periodic crystal, and in particular, the distribution of free
path lengths is not exponential.

that have vanishing linearized ADM mass, momentum, and angular momentum at
infinity and satisfy certain gauge conditions at the horizon. This is shown by
proving that---apart from pure gauge perturbations and perturbations towards
other stationary black holes---$\E$ is nondegenerate on $\mathcal T$ and that,
for axisymmetric perturbations, $\E$ has positive flux properties at both
infinity and the horizon. We further show that $\E$ is related to the second
order variations of mass, angular momentum, and horizon area by $\E = \delta^2
M - \sum_A \Omega_A \delta^2 J_A - \frac{\kappa}{8\pi} \delta^2 A$, thereby
establishing a close connection between dynamical stability and thermodynamic
stability. Thermodynamic instability of a family of black holes need not imply
dynamical instability because the perturbations towards other members of the
family will not, in general, have vanishing linearized ADM mass and/or angular
momentum. However, we prove that for any black brane corresponding to a
thermodynamically unstable black hole, sufficiently long wavelength
perturbations can be found with $\E < 0$ and vanishing linearized ADM
quantities. Thus, all black branes corresponding to thermodynmically unstable
black holes are dynamically unstable, as conjectured by Gubser and Mitra. We
also prove that positivity of $\E$ on $\mathcal T$ is equivalent to the

reversal time $T$. The time irreversibility is measured by $I \equiv |\Pi(t =
2T) - \Pi(t = 0)|$, where $\Pi$ is the participation ratio gauging the
extendedness of the wavefunction and for convenience, $t$ is measured forward
even after the time reversal . When $\eta = 0$, the time evolution after $T$
makes the wavefunction at $t=2T$ identical to the one at $t=0$, and we find
I=0, implying a null irreversibility or a complete reversibility. On the other
hand, as $\eta$ is increased from zero, the reversibility becomes weaker, and
we observe enhancement of the irreversibility. We find that $I$ linearly
increases with increasing $\eta$ in the weakly-perturbed region, and that the
irreversibility is much stronger in the WS network than in the local regular
network.

the evaluation of the exact distribution function of the largest root of a
Wishart matrix, which involves a hypergeometric function 1F1 of a matrix
argument. Numerical evaluation of the hypergeometric function has been one of
the longstanding problems in multivariate distribution theory. The holonomic
gradient method offers a totally new approach, which is complementary to the
infinite series expansion around the origin in terms of zonal polynomials. It
allows us to move away from the origin by the use of partial differential
equations satisfied by the hypergeometric function. From numerical viewpoint we
show that the method works well up to dimension 10. From theoretical viewpoint
the method offers many challenging problems both to statistics and D-module
theory.
