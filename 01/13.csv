corrupted by dirt such as manual line strokes, spilled ink etc. We aim at
autonomously removing dirt from a single letter-size page based only on the
information the page contains. Our approach, therefore, has to learn character
representations without supervision and requires a mechanism to distinguish
learned representations from irregular patterns. To learn character
representations, we use a probabilistic generative model parameterizing pattern
features, feature variances, the features' planar arrangements, and pattern
frequencies. The latent variables of the model describe pattern class, pattern
position, and the presence or absence of individual pattern features. The model
parameters are optimized using a novel variational EM approximation. After
learning, the parameters represent, independently of their absolute position,
planar feature arrangements and their variances. A quality measure defined
based on the learned representation then allows for an autonomous
discrimination between regular character patterns and the irregular patterns
making up the dirt. The irregular patterns can thus be removed to clean the
document. For a full Latin alphabet we found that a single page does not
contain sufficiently many character examples. However, even if heavily
corrupted by dirt, we show that a page containing a lower number of character
types can efficiently and autonomously be cleaned solely based on the
structural regularity of the characters it contains. In different examples
using characters from different alphabets, we demonstrate generality of the
approach and discuss its implications for future developments.

Schneider (2011) to find the maximum entropy density of an asset price to the
relative entropy case. This is applied to study the impact the choice of prior
density has in two market scenarios. In the first scenario, call option prices
are prescribed at only a small number of strikes, and we see that the choice of
prior, or indeed its omission, yields notably different densities. The second
scenario is given by CBOE option price data for S&P500 index options at a large
number of strikes. Prior information is now considered to be given by
calibrated Heston, Schoebel-Zhu or Variance Gamma models. We find that the
resulting digital option prices are essentially the same as those given by the
(non-relative) Buchen-Kelly density itself. In other words, in a sufficiently
liquid market the influence of the prior density seems to vanish almost
completely. Finally, we study variance swaps and derive a simple formula
relating the fair variance swap rate to entropy. Then we show, again, that the
prior loses its influence on the fair variance swap rate as the number of
strikes increases.

dark matter carries, if a symmetry violating interaction that works at high

this case, the present number density of baryon and dark matter can be same
order if the symmetric part of dark matter annihilates sufficiently. Moreover,
the baryon number density can be enhanced as compared to that of dark matter if
another $B-L$ violating interaction is still in thermal equilibrium after the
spontaneous genesis of dark matter, which accommodates a TeV scale asymmetric
dark matter model.

around conjunction when the radio waves emitted by pulsar A are absorbed as
they propagate through the magnetosphere of its companion pulsar B. These
eclipses offer a unique opportunity to probe directly the magnetospheric
structure and the plasma properties of pulsar B. We have performed a
comprehensive analysis of the eclipse phenomenology using multi-frequency radio
observations obtained with the Green Bank Telescope. We have characterized the
periodic flux modulations previously discovered at 820 MHz by McLaughlin et
al., and investigated the radio frequency dependence of the duration and depth
of the eclipses. Based on their weak radio frequency evolution, we conclude
that the plasma in pulsar B's magnetosphere requires a large multiplicity
factor (~ 10^5). We also found that, as expected, flux modulations are present
at all radio frequencies in which eclipses can be detected. Their complex
behavior is consistent with the confinement of the absorbing plasma in the
dipolar magnetic field of pulsar B as suggested by Lyutikov & Thompson and such
a geometric connection explains that the observed periodicity is harmonically
related to pulsar B's spin frequency. We observe that the eclipses require a
sharp transition region beyond which the plasma density drops off abruptly.
Such a region defines a plasmasphere which would be well inside the
magnetospheric boundary of an undisturbed pulsar. It is also two times smaller
than the expected standoff radius calculated using the balance of the wind
pressure from pulsar A and the nominally estimated magnetic pressure of pulsar
B.

Si irradiated by Ar+, we model the film as a viscoelastic medium into which the
ion beam continually injects biaxial compressive stress. We find that at normal
incidence, the model predicts a steady compressive stress of a magnitude
comparable to experiment. However, linear stability analysis at normal
incidence reveals that this mechanism of stress generation is unconditionally
stabilizing due to a purely kinematic material flow, depending on none of the
material parameters. Thus, despite plausible conjectures in the literature as
to its potential role in pattern formation, we conclude that beam stress at
normal incidence is unlikely to be a source of instability at any energy,
supporting recent theories attributing hexagonal ordered dots to the effects of
composition. In addition, we find that the elastic moduli appear in neither the
steady film stress nor the leading order smoothening, suggesting that the
primary effects of stress can be captured even if elasticity is neglected. This
should greatly simplify future analytical studies of highly nonplanar surface
evolution, in which the beam-injected stress is considered to be an important
effect.

the silicon from cumulative radiation damage with increasing LHC luminosity.
Central to this upgrade is a new acoustic instrument for the real-time
measurement of the C3F8/C2F6 mixture ratio and flow. The instrument and its
Supervisory, Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) software are described in
this paper. The instrument has demonstrated a resolution of 3.10-3 for
C3F8/C2F6 mixtures with ~20%C2F6, and flow resolution of 2% of full scale for
mass flows up to 30gs-1. In mixtures of widely-differing molecular weight (mw),
higher mixture precision is possible: a sensitivity of < 5.10-4 to leaks of
C3F8 into the ATLAS pixel detector nitrogen envelope (mw difference 160) has
been seen. The instrument has many potential applications, including the
analysis of mixtures of hydrocarbons, vapours for semi-conductor manufacture
and anaesthesia.

middle-mass disc galaxies obtained from simulations in a $\Lambda$CDM scenario.
These objects have photometric D/T ratios in good agreement with those observed
for late-type spirals, as well as kinematic properties in agreement with the
observational Tully-Fisher relation. We identify the different dynamical
components at z=0 on the basis of both orbital parameters and the binding
energy of stars in the galaxy. In this way, we recognize a slowly rotating
centrally concentrated spheroid, and two disc components supported by rotation:
a thin disc with stars in nearly circular orbits, and a thick disc with orbital
parameters transitional between the thin disc and the spheroid. The spheroidal
component is composed mainly by old, metal-poor and {\alpha}-enhanced stars.
The distribution of metals in this component shows, however, a clear bimodality
with a low-metallicity peak, which could be related to a classical bulge, and a
high-metallicity peak, which could be related to a pseudo-bulge. The thin disc
appears in our simulations as the youngest and most metal-rich component. The
radial distribution of ages and colours in this component are U-shaped: the new
stars are forming in the inner regions, and then migrate through secular
processes. Finally, we also find a thick disc containing about 16% of the total
stellar mass and with properties that are intermediate between those of the
thin disc and the spheroid. Its low-metallicity stars are {\alpha}-enhanced
when compared to thin disc stars of the same metallicity. The structural
parameters (e.g., the scale height) of the simulated thick discs suggest that
such a component could result from the combination of different thickening
mechanisms that include merger-driven processes, but also long-lived internal
perturbations of the thin disc. [Abridged]

computationally fast technique applied to a range of DEM models simulating
broadband imaging data from SDO/AIA and high resolution line spectra from
Hinode/EIS, as well as actual active region observations with Hinode/EIS and
XRT. As this regularization method naturally provides both vertical and
horizontal (temperature resolution) error bars we are able to test the role of
uncertainties in the data and response functions. The regularization method is
able to successfully recover the DEM from simulated data of a variety of model
DEMs (single Gaussian, multiple Gaussians and CHIANTI DEM models). It is able
to do this, at best, to over four orders of magnitude in DEM space but
typically over two orders of magnitude from peak emission. The combination of
horizontal and vertical error bars and the regularized solution matrix allows
us to easily determine the accuracy and robustness of the regularized DEM. We
find that the typical range for the horizontal errors is $\Delta$log$T\approx
0.1 -0.5$ and this is dependent on the observed signal to noise, uncertainty in
the response functions as well as the source model and temperature. With
Hinode/EIS an uncertainty of 20% greatly broadens the regularized DEMs for both
Gaussian and CHIANTI models although information about the underlying DEMs is
still recoverable. When applied to real active region observations with
Hinode/EIS and XRT the regularization method is able to recover a DEM similar
to that found via a MCMC method but in considerably less computational time.

quantum phases with a symmetry $G$, which can all be smoothly connected to the
trivial product states if we break the symmetry. It has been shown that a large
class of interacting bosonic SPT phases can be systematically described by
group cohomology theory. In this paper, we introduce a (special) group
supercohomology theory which is a generalization of the standard group
cohomology theory. We show that a large class of short-range interacting

Using the data of super cocycles, we can obtain the ideal ground state wave
function for the corresponding fermionic SPT phase. We can also obtain the bulk
Hamiltonian that realizes the SPT phase, as well as the anomalous (ie,
non-on-site) symmetry for the boundary effective Hamiltonian. The anomalous
symmetry on the boundary implies that the symmetric} boundary must be gapless
for 1+1D boundary, and must be gapless or topologically ordered beyond 1+1D. As
an application of this general result, we construct a new SPT phase in 3D, for
interacting fermionic superconductors with coplanar spin order (which have
$T^2=1$ time-reversal $Z_2^T$ and fermion-number parity $Z_2^f$ symmetries
described by a full symmetry group $Z_2^T\times Z_2^f$). Such a fermionic SPT
state can neither be realized by free fermions nor by interacting bosons
(formed by fermion-pairs), and thus are not included in the K-theory
classification for free fermions or group cohomology description for
interacting bosons. We also construct three interacting fermionic SPT phases in
2D with a full symmetry group $Z_2\times Z_2^f$. Those 2D fermionic SPT phases
all have central-charge $c=1$ gapless edge excitations, if the symmetry is not

formation, many computational studies show that the mass spectrum of density

their angular momenta, trace their origin to the statistical and physical
properties of gas that is lashed with shock waves. In this article, we review
the observations, simulations, and theories of how turbulent-like processes can
account for structures we see in molecular clouds. We then compare traditional
ideas of supersonic turbulence with a simpler physical model involving the
effects of multiple shock waves and their interaction in the interstellar
medium. Planar intersecting shock waves produce dense filaments, and generate
vortex sheets that are essential to create the broad range of density and
velocity structure in clouds. As an example, the lower mass behaviour of the
stellar initial mass function can be traced to the tendency of a collection of
shock waves to build-up a log-normal density distribution (or column density).
Vorticity - which is essential to produce velocity structure over a very broad
range of length scales in shocked clouds - can also be generated by the passage
of curved shocks or intersecting planar shocks through such media. Two major
additional physical forces affect the structure of star forming gas - gravity
and feedback processes from young stars. Both of these can produce power-law
tails at the high mass end of the IMF.

subverts system operation by emulating behavior of multiple distinct nodes.
Most recent work to address this problem leverages social networks to establish
trust relationships between users. However, the use of social networks is not
appropriate in all systems, as they can be subverted by social engineering
techniques, require nodes in a P2P network to maintain and be aware of social
network information, and may require overly optimistic assumptions about the
fast-mixing nature of social links.
  This paper explores an alternate approach. We present SybilControl, a novel,
decentralized scheme for controlling the extent of Sybil attacks. SybilControl
is an admission control mechanism for nodes in a distributed system that
requires them to periodically solve computational puzzles. SybilControl
consists of a distributed protocol to allow nodes to collectively verify the
computational work of other nodes, and mechanisms to prevent the malicious
influence of misbehaving nodes that do not perform the computational work. We
investigate the practical issues involved with deploying SybilControl into
existing DHTs, particularly with resilient lookup protocols. We evaluate
SybilControl through simulations and find that SybilControl retains low
overhead and latency. Additionally, even when the adversary controls 20% of the
system's computational resources, SybilControl-enabled DHTs can be configured
to maintain lookup performance at over 99% success rate using low communication
overhead.

that is apparently being occulted is KIC 12557548, a K dwarf with T_eff = 4400

due solely to transits of a single planet with a fixed size. We discuss but
dismiss a scenario involving a binary giant planet whose mutual orbit plane
precesses, bringing one of the planets into and out of a grazing transit. We
also briefly consider an eclipsing binary, that either orbits KIC 12557548 in a
hierarchical triple configuration or is nearby on the sky, but we find such a
scenario inadequate to reproduce the observations. We come down in favor of an
explanation that involves macroscopic particles escaping the atmosphere of a
slowly disintegrating planet not much larger than Mercury. The particles could
take the form of micron-sized pyroxene or aluminum oxide dust grains. The
planetary surface is hot enough to sublimate and create a high-Z atmosphere;
this atmosphere may be loaded with dust via cloud condensation or explosive
volcanism. Atmospheric gas escapes the planet via a Parker-type thermal wind,
dragging dust grains with it. We infer a mass loss rate from the observations
of order 1 M_E/Gyr, with a dust-to-gas ratio possibly of order unity. For our
fiducial 0.1 M_E planet, the evaporation timescale may be ~0.2 Gyr. Smaller
mass planets are disfavored because they evaporate still more quickly, as are
larger mass planets because they have surface gravities too strong to sustain
outflows with the requisite mass-loss rates. The occultation profile evinces an
ingress-egress asymmetry that could reflect a comet-like dust tail trailing the
planet; we present simulations of such a tail.

manifestations and parodoxical features of the quantum potential (QP) from the
non-relativistic and relativistic point of view. QP arises in the quantum
Hamiltonian, under various procedures of quantization of the systems whose
Hamilton functions are the positive-definite quadratic forms in momenta with
coefficients depending on the coordinates in (n-dimensional) configurational
space (natural systems). Owing to the Riemannian structure thus introduced in
the space, the result of quantization is considered as quantum mecanics (QM) of
a particle. Contradiction of QP to the Principles of General Covariance and
Equivalence is discussed. It is found that actually the historically first
Hilbert space based quantization by E. Schr\""odinger (1926), after revision in
the modern framework of QM, also leads to QP in the form that B. DeWitt had
been found 26 years later. Efforts to avoid QP or reduce its drawbacks are
discussed. The general conclusion is that some form of QP and a violation of
the principles of general relativity induced by it are apparently inevitable in
the non-relativistic QM. It is shown also that Feynman quantization singles out
two versions of QP, which both determine two bi-scalar propagators which fix
two different algorithms of path integral calculation. In the accompanying
paper under the same general title and the subtitle ""The Relativistic Point of
View"", relation of the non-relativistic QP to the quantum theory of the scalar
field non-minimally coupled to the curved space-time metric is considered.

collisions and the universal thermal aspects observed in high energy collisions
are in fact two sides of the same coin, and both are related to quantum
anomalies of QCD. We argue that the low energy relations representing the
quantum anomalies of QCD are saturated by coherent low dimensional vacuum
configurations as observed in Monte Carlo lattice studies. The thermal spectrum
and approximate universality of the temperature with no dependence on energy of
colliding particles in this framework is due to the fact that the emission
results from the distortion of these low dimensional vacuum sheets rather than
from the colliding particles themselves. The emergence of the long- range
correlations of P odd domains (a feature which is apparently required for
explanation of the asymmetry observed at RHIC and LHC) is also a result of the
same distortion of the QCD vacuum configurations. We formulate the
corresponding physics using the effective low energy effective Lagrangian. We
also formulate the same physics in terms of the dual holographic picture when
low-dimensional sheets of topological charge embedded in 4d space, as observed
in Monte Carlo simulations, are identified with D2 branes. Finally, we argue
that study of these long range correlations in heavy ion collisions could serve
as a perfect test of a proposal that the observed dark energy in present epoch
is a result of a tiny deviation of the QCD vacuum energy in expanding universe
from its conventional value in Minkowski spacetime.

However, the Yang-Mills color current density $j^{\mu a}(x)$ of the quark
satisfies the equation $D_\mu[A] j^{\mu a}(x)= 0$ which is not a continuity

$q^a(t)$ of the quark is not constant but it is time dependent where

respond independently from the configuration of the ingoing null dust if the
response is taken at any time outside of the collapsing shell. For detectors

monitoring observations of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 following the pulsar's
radiative outbursts in 2008 October and 2009 January. We report on a study of
the evolution of the timing properties and the pulsed flux from 2008 October 4
through 2009 December 26. We show that the pulsed flux decrease which followed
an initial rise in the 2008 outburst was interrupted by a spike ~9 days after
the initial outburst. In our timing study, a phase-coherent analysis shows that
for the first 29 days following the 2008 outburst, there was a very fast
increase in the magnitude of the rotational frequency derivative nudot, such
that the second derivative was a factor of ~60 larger than that reported in
data from 2007. This nudot magnitude increase occurred in concert with the
decay of the pulsed flux following the start of the 2008 event. Following the
2009 outburst, for the first 23 days, the second derivative was consistent with
zero, and nudot had returned to close to its 2007 value. In contrast to the
2008 event, the 2009 outburst showed a major increase in persistent flux,
relatively little change in the pulsed flux, and sudden significant spectral
hardening ~15 days after the outburst. We show that, excluding the month
following each of the outbursts, and because of the noise and the sparsity in
the data, multiple plausible timing solutions fit the pulsar's frequency
behavior. We note similarities in the behavior of 1E 1547.0-5408 following the
2008 outburst to that seen in the AXP 1E 1048.1-5937 following its 2001-2002

Gravitational lensing is one of the leading tools in understanding
the dark side of the Universe. The need for accurate, efficient and effective
methods which are able to extract this information along with other
cosmological parameters from cosmic shear data is ever growing. COSEBIs,
Complete Orthogonal Sets of E-/B-Integrals, is a recently developed statistical
measure that encompasses the complete E-/B-mode separable information contained
in the shear correlation functions measured on a finite angular range. Aims.
The aim of the present work is to test the properties of this newly developed
statistics for a higher-dimensional parameter space and to generalize and test
it for shear tomography. Methods. We use Fisher analysis to study the
effectiveness of COSEBIs. We show our results in terms of figure-of-merit
quantities, based on Fisher matrices. Results. We find that a relatively small
number of COSEBIs modes is always enough to saturate to the maximum information
level. This number is always smaller for 'logarithmic COSEBIs' than for 'linear
COSEBIs', and also depends on the number of redshift bins, the number and
choice of cosmological parameters, as well as the survey characteristics.
Conclusions. COSEBIs provide a very compact way of analyzing cosmic shear data,
i.e., all the E-/B-mode separable second-order statistical information in the
data is reduced to a small number of COSEBIs modes. Furthermore, with this
method the arbitrariness in data binning is no longer an issue since the
COSEBIs modes are discrete. Finally, the small number of modes also implies
that covariances, and their inverse, are much more conveniently obtainable,
e.g., from numerical simulations, than for the shear correlation functions
themselves.

not become non perturbative below the grand unification (GUT) scale, although
we also examine how these limits may be extended by the addition of extra

its energy density away from equilibrium. The entire dynamics to second order
is encoded in one first order and six second order transport coefficients,
which we compute. We classify entropy currents with non-negative divergence at
second order in relativistic gradients. We then verify that the entropy current
obtained by pulling back to the fluid surface the area form at the null horizon
indeed has a non-negative divergence. We show that there are distinct
near-horizon scaling limits that are equivalent either to the relativistic
gradient expansion we discuss here, or to the non-relativistic expansion
associated with the Navier-Stokes equations discussed in previous works. The
latter expansion may be recovered from the present relativistic expansion upon
taking a specific non-relativistic limit.

magnetohydrodynamic code Athena, we construct an ensemble of local, co-moving
plasma columns in which initial radial force balance is achieved through
various combinations of magnetic, pressure, and rotational forces. We then
examine the resulting flow morphologies and energetics to determine the degree
to which these systems become disrupted, the amount of kinetic energy
amplification attained, and the non-linear saturation behaviors. Our most
significant finding is that the details of initial force balance have a
pronounced effect on the resulting flow morphology. Models in which the initial
magnetic field is force-free deform, but do not become disrupted. Systems that
achieve initial equilibrium by balancing pressure gradients and/or rotation
against magnetic forces, however, tend to shred, mix, and develop turbulence.
In all cases, the linear growth of current-driven instabilities is
well-represented by analytic models. CDI-driven kinetic energy amplification is
slower and saturates at a lower value in force-free models than in those that
feature pressure gradients and/or rotation. In rotating columns, we find that
magnetized regions undergoing rotational shear are driven toward equipartition
between kinetic and magnetic energies. We show that these results are
applicable for a large variety of physical parameters, but we caution that
algorithmic decisions (such as choice of Riemann solver) can affect the
evolution of these systems more than physically motivated parameters.

= 3.62 hr) binary QS Vir (EC 13471-1258) revealed regular narrow X-ray eclipses
when the white dwarf passed behind its M2-4 dwarf companion. The X-ray emission
provides a clear signature of mass transfer and accretion onto the white dwarf.
The low-resolution XMM-Newton EPIC spectra are consistent with a cooling flow
model and indicate an accretion rate of Mdot= 1.7\times10^-13M\odot/yr. At 48
pc distant, QS Vir is then the second nearest accreting cataclysmic variable
known, with one of the lowest accretion rates found to date for a non-magnetic
system. To feed this accretion through a wind would require a wind mass loss
rate of Mdot ~ 2 \times 10^-12M\odot/yr if the accretion efficiency is of the
order of 10%. Consideration of likely mass loss rates for M dwarfs suggests
this is improbably high and pure wind accretion unlikely. A lack of accretion
disk signatures also presents some difficulties for direct Roche lobe overflow.
We speculate that QS Vir is on the verge of Roche lobe overflow, and that the
observed mass transfer could be supplemented by upward chromospheric flows on
the M dwarf, analogous to spicules and mottles on the Sun, that escape the
Roche surface to be subsequently swept up into the white dwarf Roche lobe. If
so, QS Vir would be in a rare evolutionary phase lasting only a million years.
The X-ray luminosity of the M dwarf estimated during primary eclipse is L_X = 3
\times 10^28 erg/s, which is consistent with that of rapidly rotating
""saturated"" K and M dwarfs.

appear. Thirdly, we investigate the nonlinear evolution of unstable PT solitons
under perturbations, and show that the energy of perturbed solitons can grow
unbounded even though the PT lattice is below the phase transition point.

emission-line fluxes from ultraviolet to far-infrared to each galaxy performing
an accurate spectral energy distribution for spectral fitting analysis. The
clusters follow the general X-ray luminosity vs. velocity dispersion trend of
L_X/sigma_c^4.4. The analysis of the distributions of galaxy density counting
up to the 5th nearest neighbor Sigma_5 shows: (1) the virial regions and the
cluster outskirts share a common range in the high density part of the
distribution. This can be attributed to the presence of massive galaxy
structures in the surroundings of virial regions (2) The virial regions of
massive clusters (sigma_c>550 km s^-1) present a Sigma_5 distribution
statistically distinguishable (~96%) from the corresponding distribution of
lowmass clusters (sigma_c<550 km s^-1). Both massive and low-mass clusters
follow a similar density-radius trend, but the low-mass clusters avoid the high
density extreme. We illustrate, with Abell 1185, the environmental trends of
galaxy populations. Maps of sky projected galaxy density show how
low-luminosity star-forming galaxies appear distributed along more spread
structures than their giant counterparts, whereas low-luminosity passive
galaxies avoid the low-density environment. Giant passive and star-forming
galaxies share rather similar sky regions with passive galaxies exhibiting more
concentrated distributions.

must require space $\Omega(n^{1 + 1/k})$ for graphs of n nodes. The hard cases
that enforce this lower bound are, however, rather dense graphs with average
degree \Omega(n^{1/k}).
  We present distance oracles that, for sparse graphs, substantially break the
lower bound barrier at the expense of higher query time. For any 1 \leq \alpha
\leq n, our distance oracles can return stretch 2 paths using O(m + n^2/\alpha)
space and stretch 3 paths using O(m + n^2/\alpha^2) space, at the expense of
O(\alpha m/n) query time. By setting appropriate values of \alpha, we get the
first distance oracles that have size linear in the size of the graph, and
return constant stretch paths in non-trivial query time. The query time can be
further reduced to O(\alpha), by using an additional O(m \alpha) space for all
our distance oracles, or at the cost of a small constant additive stretch.
  We use our stretch 2 distance oracle to present the first compact routing
scheme with worst-case stretch 2. Any compact routing scheme with stretch less
than 2 must require linear memory at some nodes even for sparse graphs; our
scheme, hence, achieves the optimal stretch with non-trivial memory

(MA), given that (1) it is the units of culture, or information, that are
undergoing variation, transmission, and selection, very close to the original
sense of memetics as it was introduced by Dawkins; and (2) this is different
from existing MA, where the idea of memetics has been utilized as a means of
local refinement by individual learning after classical global sampling of EA.
The individual pieces of information are represented as simple semantic
networks that are directed graphs of concepts and binary relations, going
through variation by memetic versions of operators such as crossover and
mutation, which utilize knowledge from commonsense knowledge bases. In
evaluating this introductory work, as an interesting fitness measure, we focus
on using the structure mapping theory of analogical reasoning from psychology
to evolve pieces of information that are analogous to a given base information.
Considering other possible fitness measures, the proposed representation and
algorithm can serve as a computational tool for modeling memetic theories of
knowledge, such as evolutionary epistemology and cultural selection theory.

  Topologies","74 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.DM cs.DC cs.DS math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of balancing load items (tokens) in networks.
Starting with an arbitrary load distribution, we allow nodes to exchange tokens
with their neighbors in each round. The goal is to achieve a distribution where
all nodes have nearly the same number of tokens.
  For the continuous case where tokens are arbitrarily divisible, most load
balancing schemes correspond to Markov chains, whose convergence is fairly
well-understood in terms of their spectral gap. However, in many applications,
load items cannot be divided arbitrarily, and we need to deal with the discrete
case where the load is composed of indivisible tokens. This discretization
entails a non-linear behavior due to its rounding errors, which makes this
analysis much harder than in the continuous case.
  We investigate several randomized protocols for different communication
models in the discrete case. As our main result, we prove that for any regular
network in the matching model, all nodes have the same load up to an additive
constant in (asymptotically) the same number of rounds as required in the

find no significant discrepancies (differences are < 2 sigma) between distance
methods, although differences at the ~10% level cannot yet be ruled out. The
potential exists for significant refinement because the data used here are
heterogeneous B-band magnitudes that will soon be supplanted by homogeneous,
near-IR magnitudes. We illustrate the use of FM distances to 1) revisit the
question of the metallicity sensitivity of various estimators, confirming the
dependence of SN Ia distances on host galaxy metallicity, and 2) provide an
alternative calibration of H_0 that replaces the classical ladder approach in
the use of extragalactic distance estimators with one that utilizes data over a
wide range of distances simultaneously.

layered CuO2 plane when an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is doped with
mobile hole carriers. We review extensive studies of multilayered copper oxides
by site-selective nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which have uncovered the
intrinsic phase diagram of antiferromagnetism (AFM) and HTSC for a
disorder-free CuO2 plane with hole carriers. We present our experimental
findings such as the existence of the AFM metallic state in doped Mott
insulators, the uniformly mixed phase of AFM and HTSC, and the emergence of
d-wave SC with a maximum Tc just outside a critical carrier density, at which
the AFM moment on a CuO2 plane disappears. These results can be accounted for
by the Mott physics based on the t-J model. The superexchange interaction J_in
among spins plays a vital role as a glue for Cooper pairs or mobile
spin-singlet pairs, in contrast to the phonon-mediated attractive interaction
among electrons established in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. We
remark that the attractive interaction for raising the $T_c$ of HTSC up to
temperatures as high as 160 K is the large J_in (~0.12 eV), which binds
electrons of opposite spins to be on neighboring sites, and that there are no
bosonic glues. It is the Coulomb repulsive interaction U(> 6 eV) among Cu-3d
electrons that plays a central role in the physics behind high-Tc phenomena. A
new paradigm of the SC mechanism opens to strongly correlated electron matter.

mild, but statistically insignificant trend favouring radial alignments is
observed within a radius of 200 kpc and traced to galaxies on the cluster red
sequence. Our results for massive clusters at z>0.5 are in stark contrast to
the findings of previous studies which find highly significant radial
alignments of galaxies in nearby clusters at z~0.1 out to at least half the
virial radius using imaging data from the SDSS. The discrepancy becomes even
more startling if radial alignment becomes more prevalent at decreasing
clustercentric distance, as suggested by both our and previous work. We
investigate and discuss potential causes for the disparity between our findings
based on HST images of clusters at z>0.5 and those obtained using groundbased

either dramatic evolution with redshift (in the sense that radial alignments

between planar and curved wavefronts, the method reduce to an inverse
transformation method in which it is the reversed shape of the desired

phase transformation are realized and it is found that the transformation on
phase is able to realize some important properties such as phase reversal or
compensation, focusing, and expanding or compressing beams, which are further
confirmed by numerical simulations. The slab can be applied to realizing
compact electromagnetic devices for which the values of the refractive index or

using a 5 GeV electron beam. The nuclear transparency, the ratio of the

$\rho A$ interaction, was studied as function of the coherence length ($l_c$),
a lifetime of the hadronic fluctuation of the virtual photon, and the
four-momentum transfer squared ($Q^2$). While the transparency for both
$^{12}$C and $^{56}$Fe showed no $l_c$ dependence, a significant $Q^2$

the color transparency effects.

weight $\ell$ then for constant $k$ a power of two less than $n$ we apply a
$k$-set birthday algorithm to the splitting system of the problem. This
randomized algorithm has time and space complexity that satisfies $T \cdot

$k$). In addition to using space efficiently, the algorithm is highly

observed to have good spectral parameters to determine the spectral peak energy
($E_p$), 1-second peak luminosity ($L_p$) and isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$).
Using our newly-constructed database with 101 GRBs, we first revise the
$E_p$--$L_p$ and $E_p$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlations. The correlation
coefficients of the revised correlations are 0.889 for 99 degree of freedom for
the $E_p$--$L_p$ correlation and 0.867 for 96 degree of freedom for the
$E_p$--$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation. These values correspond to the chance
probability of $2.18 \times 10^{-35}$ and $4.27 \times 10^{-31}$, respectively.
It is a very important issue whether these tight correlations are intrinsic
property of GRBs or caused by some selection effect of observations. In this
paper, we examine how the truncation of the detector sensitivity affects the
correlations, and we conclude they are surely intrinsic properties of GRBs.
Next we investigate origins of the dispersion of the correlations by studying
their brightness and redshift dependence. Here the brightness (flux or fluence)
dependence would be regarded as an estimator of the bias due to the detector
threshold. We find a weak fluence-dependence in the $E_p$--$E_{\rm iso}$
correlations and a redshift dependence in the $E_p$--$L_p$ correlation both
with 2 $\sigma$ statistical level. These two effects may contribute to the
dispersion of the correlations which is larger than the statistical
uncertainty. We discuss a possible reason of these dependence and give a future
prospect to improve the correlations.

$\theta_{13}$ which is compatible with the result of the Daya Bay and T2K

affects the fragmentation and mass accretion from star-forming cores. We use
ORION, an adaptive mesh refinement gravito-radiation-hydrodynamics code, to
simulate the formation of a cluster of low-mass stars, including both radiative
transfer and protostellar outflows. We ran four simulations to isolate the
individual effects of radiation feedback and outflow feedback as well as the
combination of the two. Outflows reduce protostellar masses and accretion rates
each by a factor of three and therefore reduce protostellar luminosities by an
order of magnitude. Thus, while radiation feedback suppresses fragmentation,
outflows render protostellar radiation largely irrelevant for low-mass star
formation above a mass scale of 0.05 M_sun. We find initial fragmentation of
our cloud at half the global Jeans length, ~ 0.1 pc. With insufficient
protostellar radiation to stop it, these 0.1 pc cores fragment repeatedly,
forming typically 10 stars each. The accretion rate in these stars scales with
mass as predicted from core accretion models that include both thermal and
turbulent motions. We find that protostellar outflows do not significantly
affect the overall cloud dynamics, in the absence of magnetic fields, due to
their small opening angles and poor coupling to the dense gas. The outflows
reduce the mass from the cores by 2/3, giving a core to star efficiency ~ 1/3.
The simulation with radiation and outflows reproduces the observed protostellar
luminosity function. All of the simulations can reproduce observed core mass
functions, though they are sensitive to telescope resolution. The simulation
with both radiation and outflows reproduces the galactic IMF and the two-point
correlation function of the cores observed in rho Oph.

$[\lambda]-$primitive monogenic geometric (a,b)-module. The study of this
""basic object"" (generalized Brieskorn module with one generator) which
corresponds to the minimal filtered (regular) differential equation satisfied
by a relative de Rham cohomology class, began in [B.09] where the first
structure theorems are proved. Then in [B.10] we introduced the notion of theme
which corresponds in the \ $[\lambda]-$primitive case to frescos having a
unique Jordan-H{\""o}lder sequence. Themes correspond to asymptotic expansion of
a given vanishing period, so to the image of a fresco in the module of
asymptotic expansions. For a fixed relative de Rham cohomology class (for
instance given by a smooth differential form $d-$closed and $df-$closed) each
choice of a vanishing cycle in the spectral eigenspace of the monodromy for the
eigenvalue \ $exp(2i\pi.\lambda)$ \ produces a \ $[\lambda]-$primitive theme,
which is a quotient of the fresco associated to the given relative de Rham
class itself. The first part of this paper shows that, for any \
$[\lambda]-$primitive fresco there exists an unique Jordan-H{\""o}lder sequence
(called the principal J-H. sequence) with corresponding quotients giving the
opposite of the roots of the Bernstein polynomial in a non decreasing order.
Then we introduce and study the semi-simple part of a given fresco and we
characterize the semi-simplicity of a fresco by the fact for any given order of
the roots of its Bernstein polynomial we may find a J-H. sequence making them
appear with this order. Then, using the parameter associated to a rank \ 2 \ \
$[\lambda]-$primitive theme, we introduce inductiveley a numerical invariant,
that we call the \ $\alpha-$invariant, which depends polynomially on the
isomorphism class of a fresco (in a sens which has to be defined) and which
allows to give an inductive way to produce a sub-quotient rank \ 2 \ theme of a
given \ $[\lambda]-$primitive fresco assuming non semi-simplicity. In the last
section we prove a general existence result which naturally associate a fresco
to any relative de Rham cohomology class of a proper holomorphic function of a
complex manifold onto a disc. This is, of course, the motivation for the study
of frescos.

several aggregates near the elephant trunk globule (Rim A) and bright-rimmed
clouds at the edge of the HII region (Rim B and SFO 37, 38, 39, 41), and near
HD 206267, which is the main exciting star of the HII region. Based on the
extinction estimated from the near-infrared (NIR) color-color diagram, we have
selected pre-main sequence star candidates associated with IC 1396. The age and
mass were derived from the extinction corrected color-magnitude diagram and
theoretical pre-main sequence tracks. Most of our PMS candidates have ages of <
3 Myr and masses of 0.2-0.6 Mo. Although it appears that only a few stars were
formed in the last 1 Myr in the east region of the exciting star, the age
difference among subregions in our surveyed area is not clear from the
statistical test. Our results may suggest that massive stars were born after
the continuous formation of low-mass stars for 10 Myr. The birth of the
exciting star could be the late stage of slow but contiguous star formation in
the natal molecular cloud. It may have triggered to form many low-mass stars at
the dense inhomogeneity in and around the HII region by a radiation-driven
implosion.

Reference Survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxies
in different environments. We show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratio
anti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and NUV-r
colour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. Moreover,
the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late-
to early-type galaxies. These scaling relations are similar to those observed
for the HI gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightly
coupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. We also
find a weak increase of the dust-to-HI mass ratio with stellar mass and colour
but no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. By comparing galaxies
in different environments we show that, although these scaling relations are
followed by both cluster and field galaxies, HI-deficient systems have, at
fixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological type
systematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-HI mass ratios
than HI-normal/field galaxies. This provides clear evidence that dust is
removed from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of the
environment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the HI disk.
Such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the HI and
follows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if the
dust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from the
galactic center.

luminosity ($ADCL$) and derive the value for 36 LGRBs which have spectropic
redshifts, spectral parameters determined by the Band model, 1-second peak
fluxes, fluences, and 64-msec resolution light curves whose peak counts are 10
times larger than background fluctuations. Then we devide the sample according
to the value of ADCL into two groups ($ADCL < 0.17$ and $ADCL > 0.17$) and, for
each group, derive the spectral peak energy $E_{\rm p}$ - peak luminosity
$L_{\rm p}$ correlation and the Fundamental Plane of LGRBs, which is a
correlation between the spectral peak energy $E_{\rm p}$, the luminosity time
$T_{\rm L}$ ($\equiv E_{\rm iso}/L_{\rm p}$ where $E_{\rm iso}$ is isotropic
energy) and the peak luminosity $L_{\rm p}$. We find that both of the
correlations for both groups are statistically more significant compared with
ones derived from all samples. The Fundamental Planes with small and large ADCL
are given by $L_{\rm p}=10^{52.53\pm 0.01}(E_{\rm p}/10^{2.71}{\rm
keV})^{1.84\pm 0.03} (T_{\rm L}/10^{0.86}{\rm sec})^{0.29\pm0.08}$ with

0.27}$ with $\chi^2_{\nu}=7.58/8$, respectively. This fact implies the
existence of subclasses of LGRBs characterized by the value of $ADCL$. Also
there is a hint for the existence of the intermediate-$ADCL$ class which
deviates from both fundamental planes. Both relations are so tight that our
result provides a new accurate distance measurement scheme up to the high

reweighting (MPR) in $\mu$ and $\beta$ and Taylor expansion in $\mu/T$. The use
of a reduction formula for the Wilson fermion determinant enables to study the
reweighting factor in MPR explicitly and heigher-order coefficients in Taylor
expansion free from errors of noise method, although calculations are limited
to small lattice size. As a consequence, we can study the reliability of the
thermodynamical quantities through the consistency of the two methods, each of
which has different origin of the application limit.
  The thermodynamical quantities are obtained from simulations on a $8^3\times

and Taylor expansion are consistent for the EoS and number density up to

implies within a given statistics that the overlap problem for the MPR and
truncation error for the Taylor expansion method are negligible in these

  In order to make MPR methods work, the fluctuation of the reweighting factor
should be small. We derive the equation of the reweighting line where the
fluctuation is small, and show that the equation of the reweighting line is

nonuniqueness for the parabolic stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE)
\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=\frac{\Delta}{2}u(t,x)
+\bigl|u(t,x)\bigr|^{\gamma}\dot{W}(t,x),\qquad u(0,x)=0.\] Here $\dot{W}$ is a
space-time white noise on ${\mathbb {R}}_+\times {\mathbb {R}}$. More
precisely, we show the above stochastic PDE has a nonzero solution for
$0<\gamma<3/4$. Since $u(t,x)=0$ solves the equation, it follows that solutions
are neither unique in law nor pathwise unique. An analogue of Yamada-Watanabe's
famous theorem for SDEs was recently shown in Mytnik and Perkins [Probab.
Theory Related Fields 149 (2011) 1-96] for SPDE's by establishing pathwise
uniqueness of solutions to \[\frac{\partial u}{\partial
t}=\frac{\Delta}{2}u(t,x)+\sigma \bigl(u(t,x)\bigr)\dot{W}(t,x)\] if $\sigma$
is H\""{o}lder continuous of index $\gamma>3/4$. Hence our examples show this
result is essentially sharp. The situation for the above class of parabolic
SPDE's is therefore similar to their finite dimensional counterparts, but with
the index $3/4$ in place of $1/2$. The case $\gamma=1/2$ of the first equation
above is particularly interesting as it arises as the scaling limit of the
signed mass for a system of annihilating critical branching random walks.

The new variable is less effective in the opposite-sign WW channel due to

l=0, 1, 2 with their azimuthal components in the frequency range 2.5 mHz < nu <
3.5 mHz. We found signatures of QBP at all levels of solar activity in the
modes more sensitive to higher latitudes. The signal strength increases with
latitude and the equatorial component seems also to be modulated by the 11-year
envelope. The persistent nature of the seismic QBP is not observed in the
surface activity indices, where mid-term variations are found only time to time
and mainly over periods of high activity. This feature together with the
latitudinal dependence provides more evidences in favor of a mechanism almost
independent and different from the one that brings up to the surface the active

dynamo models that consider a further cyclic component on top of the 11-year

follows naturally from the elastic problem of a finite-sized contractile layer

localization is determined by one dimensionless parameter interpolating between
linear and exponential force profiles for the extreme cases of very soft and

massless electrons as a neutralizing fluid. Up to a certain wavenumber in the

the dispersive spectral range, where also dissipative effects occur. Under
typical solar wind conditions, weak turbulence develops as a superposition of
normal modes in the kinetic regime. Spectral analysis in the direction parallel

Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron waves up to wave vectors where their resonant absorption
sets in, as well as a continuing cascade of right-handed fast-mode and whistler
waves. Perpendicular to the background field, a broad turbulent spectrum is

contractile network models can be used to understand how force is distributed

different variants of such network models. In contrast to Hookean networks,
cable networks reflect the asymmetric response of biopolymers to tension versus
compression. For passive networks, contractility is modeled by a reduced
resting length of the mechanical links. In actively contracting networks, a
constant force couple is introduced into each link in order to model
contraction by molecular motors. If combined with fixed adhesion sites, all
network models lead to invaginated cell shapes, but only actively contracting
cable networks lead to the circular arc morphology typical for strongly
adhering cells. In this case, shape and force distribution are determined by
local rather than global determinants and thus are suited to endow the cell

the possible size of an epidemic outbreak taking place on the network, in which
transmission occurs only between network neighbours, and with probability $p$.
The main conclusion is that in most cases, egocentric data allow for a large
range of possible sizes of the giant and the outbreak. However, there is an
upper bound for the latter. For the case that the network is selected uniformly
among networks with prescribed egocentric data (satisfying some conditions),
the asymptotic size of the giant and the outbreak is characterised.

curves for the ultra-short period planet WASP-43 b, in addition to eight new
measurements of the radial velocity of the star. Thanks to this extensive data
set, we improve significantly the parameters of the system. Notably, the
largely improved precision on the stellar density (2.41+-0.08 rho_sun) combined
with constraining the age to be younger than a Hubble time allows us to break
the degeneracy of the stellar solution mentioned in the discovery paper. The
resulting stellar mass and size are 0.717+-0.025 M_sun and 0.667+-0.011 R_sun.
Our deduced physical parameters for the planet are 2.034+-0.052 M_jup and
1.036+-0.019 R_jup. Taking into account its level of irradiation, the high
density of the planet favors an old age and a massive core. Our deduced orbital
eccentricity, 0.0035(-0.0025,+0.0060), is consistent with a fully circularized
orbit. We detect the emission of the planet at 2.09 microns at better than
11-sigma, the deduced occultation depth being 1560+-140 ppm. Our detection of
the occultation at 1.19 microns is marginal (790+-320 ppm) and more
observations are needed to confirm it. We place a 3-sigma upper limit of 850
ppm on the depth of the occultation at ~0.9 microns. Together, these results
strongly favor a poor redistribution of the heat to the night-side of the
planet, and marginally favor a model with no day-side temperature inversion.

local expansion rate using a prior on supernovae luminosity is presented.
Cosmologies described by an adiabatic GBH matter profile with \Omega_{out}=1

analysis including the latest BAO data from the WiggleZ collaboration and the
local expansion rate from the Hubble Space Telescope, together with Union-II
type Ia supernovae data and the position and height of the Cosmic Microwave
Background acoustic peaks. The addition of BAO data at higher redshifts
increases considerably their constraining power and represents a new drawback
for this type of models, yielding a value of the local density parameter
\Omega_{in}>0.2 which is 3\sigma apart from the value \Omega_{in}<0.15 found
using supernovae. The situation does not improve if the asymptotic flatness
assumption is dropped, and a Bayesian analysis shows that constrained GBH

geometric probes, that only recently have become sufficiently constraining to
independently rule out the whole class of adiabatic LTB models.

inter-cluster nonidentical inputs. Here, we consider general graph topologies,
which might be time-varying. The cluster consensus is defined by two aspects:
the intra-cluster synchronization, that the state differences between each pair
of agents in the same cluster converge to zero, and inter-cluster separation,
that the states of the agents in different clusters are separated. For
intra-cluster synchronization, the concepts and theories of consensus including
the spanning trees, scramblingness, infinite stochastic matrix product and
Hajnal inequality, are extended. With them, it is proved that if the graph has
cluster spanning trees and all vertices self-linked, then static linear system
can realize intra-cluster synchronization. For the time-varying coupling cases,
it is proved that if there exists T>0 such that the union graph across any
T-length time interval has cluster spanning trees and all graphs has all
vertices self-linked, then the time-varying linear system can also realize
intra-cluster synchronization. Under the assumption of common inter-cluster
influence, a sort of inter-cluster nonidentical inputs are utilized to realize
inter-cluster separation, that each agent in the same cluster receives the same
inputs and agents in different clusters have different inputs. In addition, the
boundedness of the infinite sum of the inputs can guarantee the boundedness of
the trajectory. As an application, we employ a modified non-Bayesian social
learning model to illustrate the effectiveness of our results.

the emergence of a twisted magnetic flux tube from -20,000 km of the solar
convection zone to the corona through the photosphere and the chromosphere. The
middle part of the initial tube is endowed with a density deficit to instigate
a buoyant emergence. As the tube approaches the surface, it extends
horizontally and makes a flat magnetic structure due to the photosphere ahead
of the tube. Further emergence to the corona breaks out via the
interchange-mode instability of the photospheric fields, and eventually several
magnetic domes build up above the surface. What is new in this
three-dimensional experiment is, multiple separation events of the vertical
magnetic elements are observed in the photospheric magnetogram, and they
reflect the interchange instability. Separated elements are found to gather at
the edges of the active region. These gathered elements then show shearing
motions. These characteristics are highly reminiscent of active region
observations. On the basis of the simulation results above, we propose a
theoretical picture of the flux emergence and the formation of an active region
that explains the observational features, such as multiple separations of
faculae and the shearing motion.

the Eddington ratio L/Ledd. This is important because it links the properties
of the central engine with the properties of the host galaxy; i.e., the
interstellar medium (ISM). We also confirm previously found correlations
involving the line width of Hbeta, and the strength of the FeII and [OIII]5007
emission lines, and we confirm the important role played by L/Ledd in driving
the properties of NLS1 galaxies. A spatial correlation analysis shows that
large-scale environments of the BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies of our sample are
similar. If mergers are rare in our sample, accretion-driven winds on the one
hand, or bar-driven inflows on the other hand, may account for the strong
dependence of Eigenvector 1 on ISM density.

all the fundamental features of real magnetic materials, namely their
hysteretic behavior, coercivity, remanent magnetization and saturation at high
fields. Both the overall shape of major hysteresis loop as well as First Order

to those observed in magnetic materials. The model essentially consists of a
single, spring loaded, rigid and rotative bar with non-zero friction torque.

the non-relativistic collapse of non-interacting particles. We extend our

For any positive coupling, the final state of the collapse is a regular
pressureless star rather than a singularity. We also argue that there is no

than exponential, are not only relatively likely, but they also occur in a
rather peculiar way where a finite fraction of the whole sample deviation is
concentrated on a single variable. The regime of large deviations is separated
from the regime of typical fluctuations by a phase transition where the
symmetry between the points in the sample is spontaneously broken. For
stochastic processes with a fat tailed microscopic noise, this implies that
while typical realizations are well described by a diffusion process with
continuous sample paths, large deviation paths are typically discontinuous. For
eigenvalues of random matrices with fat tailed distributed elements, a large
deviation where the trace of the matrix is anomalously large concentrates on
just a single eigenvalue, whereas in the thin tailed world the large deviation
affects the whole distribution. These results find a natural application to
finance. Since the price dynamics of financial stocks is characterized by fat
tailed increments, large fluctuations of stock prices are expected to be
realized by discrete jumps. Interestingly, we find that large excursions of
prices are more likely realized by continuous drifts rather than by
discontinuous jumps. Indeed, auto-correlations suppress the concentration of
large deviations. Financial covariance matrices also exhibit an anomalously
large eigenvalue, the market mode, as compared to the prediction of random
matrix theory. We show that this is explained by a large deviation with excess
covariance rather than by one with excess volatility.

classical bulges or pseudobulges. Classical bulges are thought to form by
galactic merger with bursty star formation, whereas pseudobulges are suggested
to form by secular evolution. Noguchi (1998, 1999) suggested another bulge
formation scenario, `clump-origin bulge'. He demonstrated using a numerical
simulation that a galactic disc forms clumpy structures in the early stage of
disc formation, then the clumps merge into a single bulge at the centre. I
perform a high-resolution N-body/SPH simulation for the formation of the
clump-origin bulge in an isolated galaxy model. I find that the clump-origin
bulge resembles pseudobulges in dynamical properties, but this bulge consists
of old and metal-rich stars. These natures, old metal-rich population but
pseudobulge-like structures, mean that the clump-origin bulge can not be simply
classified into classical bulges nor pseudobulges. From these results, I
discuss similarities of the clump-origin bulge to the Milky Way bulge.

$\frak{so}(3,1)$ and the SGA is $\frak{so}(4,2)$. We start with a
representation of $\frak{so}(4,2)$ by functions on a realization of the
Lobachevski space given by a two sheeted hyperboloid, where the Lie algebra
commutators are the usual Poisson-Dirac brackets. Then, introduce a quantized
version of the representation in which functions are replaced by operators on a
Hilbert space and Poisson-Dirac brackets by commutators. Eigenfunctions of the
Hamiltonian are given and ""naive"" ladder operators are identified. The
previously defined ""naive"" ladder operators shift the eigenvalues by a complex
number so that an alternative approach is necessary. This is obtained by a non

gives the correct relation among the eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian. We give
an eigenfunction expansion of functions over the upper sheet of two sheeted

becoming bluer on average for increasing distance from the center of Cetus, the

this in connection with the star formation history (SFH) previously derived for

differences could be due to different merger or accretion histories.

events is crucial to risk assessment and management of complex systems. The
probability distributions and correlations of recurrence intervals for many
systems have been extensively investigated. However, the impacts of microscopic
rules of a complex system on the macroscopic properties of its recurrence
intervals are less studied. In this Letter, we adopt an order-driven stock
market model to address this issue for stock returns. We find that the
distributions of the scaled recurrence intervals of simulated returns have a
power law scaling with stretched exponential cutoff and the intervals possess
multifractal nature, which are consistent with empirical results. We further
investigate the effects of long memory in the directions (or signs) and
relative prices of the order flow on the characteristic quantities of these
properties. It is found that the long memory in the order directions (Hurst
index $H_s$) has a negligible effect on the interval distributions and the
multifractal nature. In contrast, the power-law exponent of the interval
distribution increases linearly with respect to the Hurst index $H_x$ of the
relative prices, and the singularity width of the multifractal nature
fluctuates around a constant value when $H_x<0.7$ and then increases with
$H_x$. No evident effects of $H_s$ and $H_x$ are found on the long memory of
the recurrence intervals. Our results indicate that the nontrivial properties
of the recurrence intervals of returns are mainly caused by traders' behaviors
of persistently placing new orders around the best bid and ask prices.

pushdown games have been studied before with qualitative objectives, such as
reachability and $\omega$-regular objectives, in this work we study for the
first time such games with the most well-studied quantitative objective,

relevant: (1) global strategies, that depend on the entire global history; and
(2) modular strategies, that have only local memory and thus does not depend on
the context of invocation, but only on the history of the current invocation of
the module. Our main results are as follows (1) One-player pushdown games with
mean-payoff objectives under global strategies is decidable in polynomial time.
(2) Two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under global

both one-player and two-player pushdown games with mean-payoff objectives under

complexity showing that global strategies for mean-payoff objectives require
infinite memory even in one-player pushdown games; and memoryless modular
strategies are sufficient in two-player pushdown games. Finally we also show
that all the problems have the same complexity if the stack boundedness

player simultaneously and independently selects a move; the moves jointly
determine the transition to a successor state. Two basic objectives are the
safety objective to stay forever in a given set of states, and its dual, the
reachability objective to reach a given set of states. First, we present a
simple proof of the fact that in concurrent reachability games, for all
$\epsilon>0$, memoryless $\epsilon$-optimal strategies exist. A memoryless
strategy is independent of the history of plays, and an $\epsilon$-optimal
strategy achieves the objective with probability within $\epsilon$ of the value
of the game. In contrast to previous proofs of this fact, our proof is more
elementary and more combinatorial. Second, we present a strategy-improvement

objectives. We then present a strategy-improvement algorithm for concurrent
games with safety objectives. Our algorithms yield sequences of player-1
strategies which ensure probabilities of winning that converge monotonically to
the value of the game. Our result is significant because the
strategy-improvement algorithm for safety games provides, for the first time, a
way to approximate the value of a concurrent safety game from below. Previous
methods could approximate the values of these games only from one direction,

to control gain, provide signal normalization, and to selectively amplify
signals using winner-take-all (WTA) dynamics. Such models generally assume that
excitatory and inhibitory neurons are able to interact easily, because their
axons and dendrites are co-localized in the same small volume. However,
quantitative neuroanatomical studies of the dimensions of axonal and dendritic
trees of neurons in the neocortex show that this co-localization assumption is
not valid. In this paper we describe a simple modification to the WTA circuit
design that permits the effects of distributed inhibitory neurons to be coupled
through synchronization, and so allows a single WTA to be distributed widely in
cortical space, well beyond the arborization of any single inhibitory neuron,
and even across different cortical areas. We prove by non-linear contraction
analysis, and demonstrate by simulation that distributed WTA sub-systems
combined by such inhibitory synchrony are inherently stable. We show
analytically that synchronization is substantially faster than winner
selection. This circuit mechanism allows networks of independent WTAs to fully

renewed Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) showed that their spectra are
very similar to those of the well-known LBVs P Cygni and AG Car, and the
recently discovered cLBV MN112, which implies the LBV classification for these
stars as well. The LBV classification of both stars is supported by detection
of their significant photometric variability: one of them brightened in the R-
and I-bands by 0.68\pm0.10 mag and 0.61\pm0.04 mag, respectively, during the
last 13-18 years, while the second one (known as Hen 3-1383) varies its B,V,R,I
and K_s brightnesses by \simeq 0.5-0.9 mag on time-scales from 10 days to
decades. We also found significant changes in the spectrum of Hen 3-1383 on a
timescale of \simeq 3 months, which provides additional support for the LBV
classification of this star. Further spectrophotometric monitoring of both
stars is required to firmly prove their LBV status. We discuss a connection
between the location of massive stars in the field and their fast rotation, and

the system's dynamics are substantially affected: a ""limited resources"" regime
emerges, where the current is limited by the rate of refuelling, and the usual

rate beta for a fixed entry rate alpha. This is a new feature that can only be
obtained by the inclusion of both kinds of limited resources. We also show that
the fluctuations in particle density in the LD and HD phases are unaffected by
fluctuations in the number of loaded fuel carriers, except by the fact that
when these fuel resources become limited, the particle hopping rate is severely

disk surrounding them, the so-called circumbinary disk, will be formed. The
binary exerts a gravitational torque on the circumbinary disk and thereby the
orbital angular momentum is transferred to it, while the angular momentum of
the circumbinary disk is transferred to the binary through the mass accretion.
The binary undergoes an orbital decay due to both the gravitational wave
emission and the binary-disk interaction. This causes the phase evolution of
the gravitational wave signal. The precise measurement of the gravitational
wave phase thus may provide information regarding the circumbinary disk. In
this paper, we assess the detectability of the signature of the binary-disk
interaction using the future space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as
DECIGO and BBO by the standard matched filtering analysis. We find that the
effect of the circumbinary disk around binary black holes in the mass range
$6M_sun\le{M}\lesssim3\times10^3M_sun$ is detectable at a statistically
significant level in five year observation, provided that gas accretes onto the
binary at a rate greater than $\dot{M}\sim1.4\times10^{17} [gs^{-1}]
j^{-1}(M/10M_sun)^{33/23}$ with 10% mass-to-energy conversion efficiency, where
j represents the efficiency of the angular momentum transfer from the binary to
the circumbinary disk. We show that $O(0.1)$ coalescence events are expected to
occur in sufficiently dense molecular clouds in five year observation. We also
point out that the circumbinary disk is detectable, even if its mass at around
the inner edge is by over 10 orders of magnitude less than the binary mass.

resulting equation of state is stiffer than the one obtained when mean-field is
applied to the standard version of the model. In order to understand the
physical nature of these finite $N_c$ contributions, we perform a numerical
analysis to show that the OPT quantum corrections mimic effective repulsive
vector-vector interaction contributions. We also derive a simple analytical
approximation for the mass gap, accurate at the percent level, matching the
mean-field approximation extended by an extra vector channel to OPT. For $\mu
\gtrsim \mu_c$ the effective vector coupling matching OPT is numerically close
(for the Abelian model) to the Fierz-induced Hartree-Fock value $G/(2N_c)$,
where $G$ is the scalar coupling, and then increases with $\mu$ in a

The

frequency of a localized solution resides in one of the finite band gaps, the
solution is a gap soliton, characterized by the presence of infinitely many
zeros in the spatial profile of the soliton. Recently, how to construct such
gap solitons through a composite phase portrait is shown. By exploiting the
phase-space method and combining it with the application of a topological

the phase portrait of the solution. Surface gap solitons at the interface
between a periodic inhomogeneous and a homogeneous medium are also discussed.

whether the B[e] behaviour of HD 327083 is related to its binarity or its
evolutionary state. Here we address this issue by studying its circumstellar
environment with high spatial resolution. To this end, we have observed HD
327083 with the VLTI and AMBER in the medium resolution K-band setting. 13CO
bandhead emission is detected, confirming HD 327083 is a post-main sequence
object. The observations spatially resolve the source of the NIR continuum and
the Br-gamma and CO line emission. In addition, differential phase measurements
allow us to probe the origin of the observed Br-gamma emission with sub-mas
precision. Using geometrical models, we find that the visibilities and closure
phases suggest that the close binary system is surrounded by a circum-binary
disk. We also find that in the case of the binary HD 327083, the relative sizes
of the continuum and Br-gamma emitting regions are different to those of a
single supergiant B[e] star where the standard dual outflow scenario is thought
to apply. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the mass loss

driven by an external force applied to the unstable mode of the triad. The
equations are Hamiltonian, and can be reduced to a dynamical system for 5 real
variables with 2 conservation laws. If the Hamiltonian, $H$, is zero we reduce
this dynamical system to the motion of a particle in a one-dimensional
time-independent potential and prove that the system is integrable. Explicit
solutions are obtained for some particular initial conditions. When explicit
solution is not possible we present a novel numerical/analytical method for
approximating the dynamics. Furthermore we show analytically that when H=0 the
motion is generically bounded. That is to say the waves in the forced triad are
bounded in amplitude for all times for any initial condition with the single
exception of one special choice of initial condition for which the forcing is
in phase with the nonlinear oscillation of the triad. This means that the
energy in the forced triad generically remains finite for all time despite the
fact that there is no dissipation in the system. We provide a detailed
characterisation of the dependence of the period and maximum energy of the
system on the conserved quantities and forcing intensity. When $H \neq 0$ we
reduce the problem to the motion of a particle in a one-dimensional
time-periodic potential. Poincar\'{e} sections of this system provide strong
evidence that the motion remains bounded when $H \neq 0$ and is typically
quasi-periodic although periodic orbits can certainly be found. Throughout our
analyses, the phases of the modes in the triad play a crucial role in
understanding the dynamics.

secrecy capacity is achieved by Gaussian input without prefixing. To attain
this, we form another MISOSE channel for upper-bounding, and tighten the bound
by finding the worst correlations between the legitimate and eavesdropper
channel coefficients. The resulting upper bound is tighter than the others in
the literature which are based on modifying the correlation between the noises

The radio galaxy IC310 in the Perseus cluster has recently been
detected in the gamma-ray regime at GeV and TeV energies. The TeV emission
shows time variability and an extraordinarily hard spectrum, even harder than
the spectrum of the similar nearby gamma-ray emitting radio galaxy M87.
  Aims. High-resolution studies of the radio morphology help to constrain the
geometry of the jet on sub-pc scales and to find out where the high-energy
emission might come from.
  Methods. We analyzed May 2011 VLBA data of IC310 at a wavelength of 3.6 cm,
revealing the parsec-scale radio structure of this source. We compared our
findings with more information available from contemporary single-dish flux
density measurements with the 100-m Effelsberg radio telescope.
  Results. We have detected a one-sided core-jet structure with blazar-like,
beamed radio emission oriented along the same position angle as the kiloparsec
scale radio structure observed in the past by connected interferometers.
Doppler-boosting favoritism is consistent with an angle of theta < 38 degrees
between the jet axis and the line-of-sight, i.e., very likely within the
boundary dividing low-luminosity radio galaxies and BL Lac objects in unified
schemes.
  Conclusions. The stability of the jet orientation from parsec to kiloparsec
scales in IC310 argues against its classification as a headtail radio galaxy;
i.e., there is no indication of an interaction with the intracluster medium
that would determine the direction of the tail. IC310 seems to represent a
low-luminosity FRI radio galaxy at a borderline angle to reveal its BL Lac-type
central engine.

symmetry. We formulate a lattice functional integral for quantum gravity in
terms of fermions. This allows for a diffeomorphism invariant functional
measure and avoids problems of boundedness of the action. We discuss the
concept of lattice diffeomorphism invariance. This is realized if the action
does not depend on the positioning of abstract lattice points on a continuous
manifold. Our formulation of lattice spinor gravity also realizes local Lorentz
symmetry. Furthermore, the Lorentz transformations are generalized such that
the functional integral describes simultaneously euclidean and Minkowski
signature. The difference between space and time arises as a dynamical effect
due to the expectation value of a collective metric field. The quantum
effective action for the metric is diffeomorphism invariant. Realistic gravity
can be obtained if this effective action admits a derivative expansion for long
wavelengths.

Li et al., ACS Nano
5, 5957 (2011)], we study theoretically the interaction of chlorine with
graphene. In previous theoretical studies, covalent binding between chlorine
and carbon atoms has been elusive upon adsorption to the graphene basal plane.
Interestingly, in their recent experiment, Li et al. interpreted their data in
terms of chemical bonding of chlorine on top of the graphene plane, associated
with a change from sp2 to sp3 in carbon hybridization and formation of graphene
nanodomains. We study the hypothesis that these domains are actually fractured
graphene with chlorinated edges, and compare the energetics of
chlorine-containing graphene edge terminations, both in zigzag and armchair
directions, to chlorine adsorption onto infinite graphene. Our results indicate
that edge chlorination is favored over adsorption in the experimental
conditions with radical atomic chlorine and that edge chlorination with
sp3-hybridized edge carbons is stable also in ambient conditions. An ab initio
thermodynamical analysis shows that the presence of chlorine is able to break
the pristine graphene layer. Finally, we discuss the possible effects of the
silicon dioxide substrate on the chlorination of graphene.

intuitive explanation for what it meant. Centuries have passed and physicists
as well as philosophers still argue over its meaning. Three types of mass are
generally identified: inertial mass, active gravitational mass and passive
gravitational mass. In addition to the question of what role mass plays in
dynamical equations and why, the origin of the particular amount of matter
associated with an elementary particle as a consequence of fundamental fields
has long been a topic of research and discussion. In this paper, various
representations of inertial mass are discussed within the framework of
fundamental (either Galilean or Poincar\'e invariant) dynamical equations of
waves and point particles. It is shown that the derived equations have
mass-like and mass parameters for waves and point particles, respectively, and
that the physical meaning of these parameters sheds a new light on the
fundamental problem of the nature of inertial mass.
