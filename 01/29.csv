generalized-gradient approximation to density-functional theory. For $N = m+n
\leq 6$ a thorough sampling of all cluster topologies has been performed, while
for $N = 7$ and 8 only a few representative topologies are considered. In all
cases the entire concentration range is systematically investigated. All the
clusters show ferromagnetic-like order in the optimized structures. As a
result, the average magnetic moment per atom $\bar\mu_N$ increases
monotonously, which is almost linear over a wide range of concentration with Fe
content. A remarkable enhancement of the local Fe moments beyond 3 $\mu_B$ is
observed as result of Rh doping. The composition dependence of the binding
energy, average magnetic moment and electronic structure are discussed.

computations. A method for estimating the errors which affect intermediate and
final results is proposed and a summary of many software simulations is
discussed. The basic idea consists of representing FP numbers by means of a
data structure collecting value and estimated error information. Under certain
constraints, the estimate of the absolute error is accurate and has a compact
statistical distribution. By monitoring the estimated relative error during a
computation (an ad-hoc definition of relative error has been used), the
validity of results can be ensured. The error estimate enables the
implementation of robust algorithms, and the detection of ill-conditioned
problems. A dynamic extension of number precision, under the control of error
estimates, is advocated, in order to compute results within given error bounds.
A reduced time penalty could be achieved by a specialized FP processor. The
realization of a hardwired processor incorporating the method, with current
technology, should not be anymore a problem and would make the practical
adoption of the method feasible for most applications.

Radiative MHD simulations representing a quiet region and a plage region,

analyzed. Results: The flow structure in the upper photospheric layers of the
two simulations is considerably different: the non-magnetic simulation is
dominated by a pattern of moving shock fronts while the magnetic simulation
shows vertically extended vortices associated with magnetic flux
concentrations. Both kinds of structures induce substantial local heating. The
resulting average temperature profiles are characterized by a steep rise above
the temperature minimum due to shock heating in the non-magnetic case and by a
flat photospheric temperature gradient mainly caused by Ohmic dissipation in
the magnetic run. Conclusions: Shocks in the quiet Sun and vortices in the
strongly magnetized regions represent the dominant flow structures in the
layers around the temperature minimum. They are closely connected with
dissipation processes providing localized heating.

  Sixth Conference on Function Spaces at SIUE USA 2010",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  UNIFORM algebras have been extensively investigated because of their
importance in the theory of uniform approximation and as examples of complex
Banach algebras. An interesting question is whether analogous algebras exist
when a complete valued field other than the complex numbers is used as the
underlying field of the algebra. In the Archimedean setting, this
generalisation is given by the theory of real function algebras introduced by
S. H. Kulkarni and B. V. Limaye in the 1980s. This thesis establishes a broader
theory accommodating any complete valued field as the underlying field by
involving Galois automorphisms and using non-Archimedean analysis. The approach
taken keeps close to the original definitions from the Archimedean setting.
Basic function algebras are defined and generalise real function algebras to
all complete valued fields. Several examples are provided. Each basic function
algebra is shown to have a lattice of basic extensions related to the field
structure. In the non-Archimedean setting it is shown that certain basic
function algebras have residue algebras that are also basic function algebras.
A representation theorem is established. Commutative unital Banach F-algebras
with square preserving norm and finite basic dimension are shown to be
isometrically F-isomorphic to some subalgebra of a Basic function algebra. The
theory of non-commutative real function algebras was established by K. Jarosz
in 2008. The possibility of their generalisation to the non-Archimedean setting
is established in this thesis. In the context of complex uniform algebras, a
new proof is given using transfinite induction of the Feinstein-Heath Swiss
cheese ""Classicalisation"" theorem.

spintronics. In this paper we propose to realize helical metals through the
application of THz light on common two-dimensional semiconductors and discuss
their observable properties. We show that the application of circularly
polarized light enables coherent manipulation of magnetization. Moreover, for a
range of chemical potentials the system behaves as a helical metal, exhibiting
a large anomalous Hall conductivity and associated magnetoelectric effect.
Proposed dynamical engineering of material properties through light in
much-studied materials opens new perspectives for future applications.

the Fermi liquid in conductivity and thermodynamics, but is sharply distinct in
one electron properties, such as the electron spectral function. We dub this
phase the `Orthogonal Metal.' The Orthogonal Metal and the transition to it
from the Fermi liquid are naturally described using a slave particle
representation wherein the electron is expressed as a product of a fermion and
a slave Ising spin. We emphasize that when the slave spins are disordered the
result is not a Mott insulator (as erroneously assumed in the prior literature)
but rather the Orthogonal Metal. We construct prototypical ground state
wavefunctions for the Orthogonal Metal by modifying the Jastrow factor of
Slater-Jastrow wavefunctions that describe ordinary Fermi liquids. We further
demonstrate that the transition from the Fermi liquid to the Orthogonal Metal
can, in some circumstances, provide a simple example of a continuous
destruction of a Fermi surface with a critical Fermi surface appearing right at
the critical point. We present exactly soluble models that realize an
Orthogonal Metal phase, and the phase transition to the Fermi liquid. These
models thus provide valuable solvable examples for phase transitions associated
with the death of a Fermi surface.

different indices of refraction and split in an inhomogeneous magnetic field.
For a magnetic field inhomogeneous in the direction transverse to the light
propagation an analytical solution is obtained both for the index of refraction
and the beams' trajectories. In a cavity experiment, the beam splitting creates
a bifurcation effect, which results in a decrease of the light intensity in the
central region. Modulation of magnetic field can separate this effect from
background by providing a narrow frequency range for any observed signal. When
one integrates this effect over time and accounts for bandwidth, the overall
drop in FWHM intensity is of order 10-2%. This is a very measurable effect.

the Fornax Brightest Cluster Galaxy NGC 1316 (Fornax A). The planetary nebulae
and existing kinematics are used to explore the rotation of this merger remnant
and constrain dynamical models. Methods. Using FORS2 on the VLT, the PN
velocities were measured using a counter-dispersed slitless-spectroscopy
technique that produced the largest-to-date sample outside of the Local Group.
Spherical, non-rotating, constant-anisotropy Jeans models were con- strained by
observations of the planetary nebulae and existing integrated light spectra.
Results. The two-dimensional velocity field indicates dynamically-important
rotation that rises in the outer parts, possibly due to the outward transfer of
angular momentum during the merger. The modeling indicates a high dark matter
content, particularly in the outer parts, that is consistent with previous
estimates from dynamical models, lensing and stellar population models.
Conclusions. The exceptionally large sample of PN velocities makes it possible
to explore the kinematics of NGC 1316 in detail. Comparing the results to other
early-type galaxies like NGC 1399 and NGC 4594 (M104, Sombrero), NGC 1316
represents a transi- tion phase from a major-merger event to a bulge-dominated

as an index of parenchymal and airway status as well as an index of regional
ventilation and can be used to detect pathologic changes over time. In this
article, we propose a new regional measure of lung mechanics --- the specific
air volume change by corrected Jacobian.
  Methods: 4DCT and Xe-CT data sets from four adult sheep are used in this
study. Nonlinear, 3D image registration is applied to register an image
acquired near end inspiration to an image acquired near end expiration.
Approximately 200 annotated anatomical points are used as landmarks to evaluate
registration accuracy. Three different registration-based measures of regional
lung mechanics are derived and compared: the specific air volume change
calculated from the Jacobian (SAJ); the specific air volume change calculated
by the corrected Jacobian (SACJ); and the specific air volume change by
intensity change (SAI).
  Results: After registration, the mean registration error is on the order of 1
mm. For cubical ROIs in cubes with size 20 mm $\times$ 20 mm $\times$ 20 mm,
the SAJ and SACJ measures show significantly higher correlation (linear
regression, average $r^2=0.75$ and $r^2=0.82$) with the Xe-CT based measure of
specific ventilation (sV) than the SAI measure. For ROIs in slabs along the
ventral-dorsal vertical direction with size of 150 mm $\times$ 8 mm $\times$ 40
mm, the SAJ, SACJ, and SAI all show high correlation (linear regression,
average $r^2=0.88$, $r^2=0.92$ and $r^2=0.87$) with the Xe-CT based sV without
significant differences when comparing between the three methods.
  Conclusion: Given a deformation field by an image registration algorithm,
significant differences between the SAJ, SACJ, and SAI measures were found at a
regional level compared to the Xe-CT sV in four sheep that were studied.

dynamical behaviors of stochastic differential equations with non-Gaussian
alpha-stable type Levy motions. Both deterministic quantities are characterized
by differential-integral equations(i.e.,differential equations with non local
terms) but with different exterior conditions. The non-Gaussianity of noises
manifests as nonlocality at the level of mean exit time and escape probability.
An objective of this paper is to make mean exit time and escape probability as
efficient computational tools, to the applied probability community, for
quantifying stochastic dynamics. An accurate numerical scheme is developed and
validated for computing the mean exit time and escape probability. Asymptotic
solution for the mean exit time is given when the pure jump measure in the Levy
motion is small.
  From both the analytical and numerical results, it is observed that the mean
exit time depends strongly on the domain size and the value of alpha in the
alpha-stable Levy jump measure. The mean exit time can measure which of the two
competing factors in alpha-stable Levy motion, i.e. the jump frequency or the
jump size, is dominant in helping a process exit a bounded domain. The escape
probability is shown to vary with the underlying vector field(i.e.,drift). The
mean exit time and escape probability could become discontinuous at the
boundary of the domain, when the process is subject to certain deterministic
potential and the value of alpha is in (0,1).

DNA-functionalised colloids typically crystallize in a narrow temperature
window, if at all. The underlying reason is the extreme sensitivity of
DNA-mediated interactions to temperature or other physical control parameters.
We propose to widen the window for colloidal crystallization by exploiting the
competition between DNA linkages with different nucleotide sequences, which
results in a temperature-dependent switching of the dominant bond type.
Following such a strategy, we can decrease the temperature dependence of
DNA-mediated self assembly to make systems that can crystallize in a wider
temperature window than is possible with existing systems of DNA functionalised
colloids. We report Monte Carlo simulations that show that the proposed
strategy can indeed work in practice for real systems and specific, designable
DNA sequences. Depending on the length ratio of the different DNA constructs,
we find that the bond switching is either energetically driven (equal length or
`symmetric' DNA) or controlled by a combinatorial entropy gain (`asymmetric'
DNA), which results from the large number of possible binding partners for each
DNA strand. We provide specific suggestions for the DNA sequences with which
these effects can be achieved experimentally.

Leaving us about 11 fb-1 of data per experiment to analyze. Associated
production of a Higgs boson and a vector gauge boson W or Z is the main search
channel for a light standard Higgs boson (i.e. below 135 GeV/c2). Using data
collected by DZERO, we are looking for this production mode taking advantage of
sophisticated techniques to improve the signal sensitivity such as b-jet
identification and multivariate discriminants. In the end, a statistical
approach allows us to set an upper limit on the ratio between the observed
(resp. expected) Higgs production cross section and its theoretical cross
section. The latest result obtained in the WH channel using 8.5 f b-1 at DZERO
is 4.6 (resp. 3.5) for a 115 GeV/c2 Higgs boson.

Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique for signal detection and channel estimation on the

makes a probabilistic choice between Gibbs sampling and random sampling in each
iteration) for detection and a Gibbs sampling based method for channel
estimation is proposed. The algorithm proposed for detection alleviates the
stalling problem encountered at high SNRs in conventional MCMC algorithm and
achieves near-optimal performance in large systems. A novel ingredient in the
detection algorithm that is responsible for achieving near-optimal performance
at low complexities is the joint use of a {\it randomized MCMC (R-MCMC)
strategy} coupled with a {\it multiple restart strategy} with an efficient
restart criterion. Near-optimal detection performance is demonstrated for large
number of BS antennas and users (e.g., 64, 128, 256 BS antennas/users). The
proposed MCMC based channel estimation algorithm refines an initial estimate of
the channel obtained during pilot phase through iterations with R-MCMC
detection during data phase. In time division duplex (TDD) systems where
channel reciprocity holds, these channel estimates can be used for multiuser
MIMO precoding on the downlink. Further, we employ this receiver architecture
in the frequency domain for receiving cyclic prefixed single carrier (CPSC)
signals on frequency selective fading between users and the BS. The proposed
receiver achieves performance that is near optimal and close to that achieved

the analysis suggests an interpretation of the 'little hierarchy problem' as an

nonlinearization of the second SUSY (imposed by the presence of the D-brane)
opens this possibility, by constructing the global N = 1 linear + 1 nonlinear

calculations are described, too. Special emphasis is given to the look
elsewhere effect, which arises when the search of a new signal is carried out
over a broad mass range, therefore specifying separately local and global
significances. When combined together, the global p-value of the localized
excesses detected in the two channels is found equal to either 0.033 or 0.013,
corresponding, respectively, to a significance of 1.8 sigma and 2.2 sigma
depending upon the assumption of mutual independence or dependence of the
amplitudes of the expected signal in each channel. Among the other obtained
results, the local and global significances of the two channels individually
taken are computed in good agreement with those reported by the Collaboration,
while only a minor discrepancy is found for their combined local significance.
Finally, some considerations are illustrated related to the low statistics four
lepton decay channel, showing that a search strategy different from the profile
likelihood method, e.g. scan statistics, can result in a substantially
different significance, enhanced to a 3.3 sigma global effect.

the Universe is Not Designed for Us. It investigated a common claim found in
contemporary religious literature that the parameters of physics and cosmology
are so delicately balanced, so ""fine-tuned,"" that any slight change and life in
the universe would have been impossible. I concluded that while the precise
form of life we find on Earth would not exist with slight changes in these
parameters, some form of life could have evolved over a parameter range that is
not infinitesimal, as often claimed. Postdoctoral fellow Luke Barnes has
written a lengthy, highly technical review [arXiv:1112.4647] of the scientific
literature on the fine-tuning problem. I have no significant disagreement with
that literature and no prominent physicist or cosmologist has disputed my basic
conclusions. Barnes does not invalidate these conclusions and misunderstands
and misrepresents much of what is in the book.

  Physical Categories","28 pages. Revised. Dedicated to Ambiga Sreenivasan for her
  unprecedented courage",,,,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logical proofs and definitions are developed to establish (i) the
energy-level spacings, \xi for each chemical element (from the periodic table
of chemical elements) can be converted to the ionization energies, (ii) both
\xi and the ionization energies are unique, and (iii) the averaged ionization
energies of any quantum matter is proportional to the averaged ionization
energies of its constituent chemical elements, if and only if \xi not = 0 and
\xi is not an irrelevant constant. Physical sets are then constructed such that
they are members of a specific physical class where each class belongs to a
specific physical category, P. However, there is not a single
structure-preserving functor from one energy-level spacing physical category,
P(\xi) to another P'(\xi). Therefore, the existence of many P(\xi) imply the
existence of different categories of physical systems and quantum matter.
