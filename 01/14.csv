(Fe line) and 8 keV (Fe/Ni line) in {\em RHESSI} X-ray spectra during solar
flares. Spectra during long-duration flares with steady declines were selected,
with an isothermal assumption and improved data analysis methods over previous
work. Two spectral fitting models give comparable results, viz. an iron
abundance that is lower than previous coronal values but higher than
photospheric values. In the preferred method, the estimated Fe abundance is
$A({\rm Fe}) = 7.91 \pm 0.10$ (on a logarithmic scale, with $A({\rm H}) = 12$),
or $2.6 \pm 0.6$ times the photospheric Fe abundance. Our estimate is based on
a detailed analysis of 1,898 spectra taken during 20 flares. No variation from
flare to flare is indicated. This argues for a fractionation mechanism similar
to quiet-Sun plasma. The new value of $A({\rm Fe})$ has important implications
for radiation loss curves, which are estimated.

(BSDEs) have been a popular field of research. However there are only very few
examples where explicit solutions for these equations are known. In this paper
we consider a class of quadratic BSDEs involving affine processes and show that
their solution can be reduced to solving a system of generalized Riccati
ordinary differential equations. In other words we introduce a rich and
flexible class of quadratic BSDEs which are analytically tractable, i.e.
explicit up to the solution of an ODE. Our results also provide analytically
tractable solutions to the problem of utility maximization and indifference
pricing in multivariate affine stochastic volatility models. This generalizes
univariate results of Kallsen and Muhle-Karbe and some results in the
multivariate setting of Leippold and Trojani by establishing the full picture
in the multivariate affine jump-diffusion setting. In particular we calculate
the interesting quantity of the power utility indifference value of change of
numeraire. Explicit examples in the Heston, Barndorff-Nielsen-Shephard and
multivariate Heston setting are calculated.

difficulties that are usually encountered within conventional SUSY breaking
scenarios, e.g., the $\mu$ problem, the imposition of R-parity 'by hand', the
generation of light neutrino masses and obtaining a light Higgs boson with a
mass as large as $\sim$ 125 GeV as suggested by recent LHC measurements. In
addressing these problems, such a scenario predicts the existence of additional
singlet and vector-like superfields beyond those in the MSSM as well as
possibly two new neutral gauge bosons near the TeV scale. In this paper the
phenomenological implications of simultaneous gauge kinetic mixing between the
usual Standard Model (SM) hypercharge gauge field and both these new neutral
gauge fields present in the $E_6$SSM scenario is explored. To this end a large
class of specific toy models realizing this type of kinetic mixing is examined.
In particular, we demonstrate that a significant suppression (or enhancement)
of the expected event rate for $Z'$ production in the dilepton channel at the
LHC is not likely to occur in this scenario due to gauge kinetic mixing.

popularity for modelling market behaviour for both derviative pricing and risk
management purposes. Chan et al. (2009) introduced the use of empirical
likelihood methods to estimate the parameters of various diffusion processes
via their characteristic functions which are readily avaiable in most cases.
Return series from the market are used for estimation. In addition to the
return series, there are many derivatives actively traded in the market whose
prices also contain information about parameters of the underlying process.
This observation motivates us, in this paper, to combine the return series and
the associated derivative prices observed at the market so as to provide a more
reflective estimation with respect to the market movement and achieve a gain of
effciency. The usual asymptotic properties, including consistency and
asymptotic normality, are established under suitable regularity conditions.
Simulation and case studies are performed to demonstrate the feasibility and
effectiveness of the proposed method.

pathogenesis of psoriatic disease is carried out. The new model of pathogenesis
- skin reaction to systemic psoriatic process SPP is formulated. ... Psoriatic
inflammation is regarded as a reaction of the skin immune system to activity of
Mo-R and DC-R involved in derma from blood flow. They contain Y-antigen and,
getting to derma, can be transformed in mature maDC-Y and present this antigen
to Y-specific T-lymphocytes as well as activate them. Y-antigen is a part of
the interpeptide bridge IB-Y. Therefore, the skin immune system can incorrectly
interpret Y-antigen presentation as a sign of external PsB-infection and switch
one of mechanisms of protection against bacterial infection - epidermal
hyperproliferation. Psoriatic plaque can be initiated only during action of
local inflammatory process LP2 in derma causing not only innate, but also
adaptive response. In particular, it is possible at LP2(IN) - open trauma of
derma or at LP2(HPV) - HPV-carriage of keratinocytes. The level of Y-priming
(presence and concentration of Y-specific T-lymphocytes in prepsoriatic derma
and in lymph nodes) also determines possibility of psoriatic plaque initiation.
Existence and severity of psoriatic plaque is determined by intensity of
Y-antigen income into derma (inside Mo-R and DC-R). ... Severity of plaque is
aggravated by LP2-inflammation if it persists after this plaque initiation. New
Mo-T, DC-T (incl. Mo-R, DC-R) and Y-specific T-lymphocytes are constantly
attracted into plaques from blood flow, and so support vicious cycles. Only at
decrease of SPP severity, these vicious cycles weaken and natural remission of
plaques takes place, up to their complete disappearance. The detailed analysis
comparing the new model of pathogenesis with five other previously published
models is carried out. Part 1. arXiv:1110.0584

discovered an exceptionally bright source behind the z=0.22 cluster Abell 773,
which appears to be a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z=5.2429.
This source is unusual compared to most other lensed sources discovered by
Herschel so far, because of its higher submm flux (\sim 200mJy at 500\micron)
and its high redshift. The dominant lens is a foreground z=0.63 galaxy, not the
cluster itself. The source has a far-infrared (FIR) luminosity of L_FIR= 1.1
10^{14}/\mu Lo, where \mu is the magnification factor, likely \sim 11. We
report here the redshift identification through CO lines with the IRAM-30m, and
the analysis of the gas excitation, based on CO(7-6), CO(6-5), CO(5-4) detected
at IRAM and the CO(2-1) at the EVLA. All lines decompose into a wide and strong
red component, and a narrower and weaker blue component, 540\kms apart.
Assuming the ultraluminous galaxy (ULIRG) CO-to-H2 conversion ratio, the H2
mass is 5.8 10^{11}/\mu Mo, of which one third is in a cool component. From the
CI line we derive a CI/H2 number abundance of 6 10^{-5} similar to that in
other ULIRGs. The H2O line is strong only in the red velocity component, with
an intensity ratio I(H_2O)/I(CO) \sim 0.5, suggesting a strong local FIR
radiation field, possibly from an active nucleus (AGN) component. We detect the
[NII]205\mics line for the first time at high-z. It shows comparable blue and
red components, with a strikingly broad blue one, suggesting strong ionized gas
flows.

framework of Fickett's model for reactive compressible flows, i.e., the
reactive form of Burgers' equation. An induction-reaction two-step
chain-branching model is used to study the coupling between the energy release
and the compressible hydrodynamics occurring during the shock ignition
transient leading to a detonation. Owing to the model's simplicity, the
ignition and acceleration mechanism is explained using the two families of
characteristics admitted by the model. The energy release along the particle
paths provides the amplification of forward-travelling pressure waves. These
waves pre-compress the medium in the induction layer ahead of the reaction
zone, therefore changing the induction delays of successive particles. The
variation of the induction delay provides the modulation of the amplification
of the forward travelling pressure waves by controlling the residence time of
the pressure waves in the reaction zone. A closed form analytical solution is
obtained by the method of characteristics and high activation energy
asymptotics. The acceleration of the reaction zone was found to be proportional
to the product of the activation energy, the ratio of the induction to reaction
time and the heat release. This finding provides a theoretical justification
for the previous use of this non-dimensional number to characterize the
ignition regimes observed experimentally in detonations and shock induced
ignition phenomena. Numerical simulations are presented and analysed. Both
subsonic and supersonic internal flame propagation regimes are observed,
consistent with experiment and previous reactive Euler models.

low-redshift SNe Ia observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project between 2004 to
2007 is used. All 27 objects have pre-maximum coverage in optical bands, with a
subset of 13 having pre-maximum NIR observations as well. We describe the
methods used to derive absolute peak magnitudes and decline rates from both
spline- and template-fitting procedures, and confirm prior findings that
fitting templates to SNe Ia light curves in the NIR is problematic due to the
diversity of post-maximum behaviour of objects that are characterized by
similar decline rate values, especially at high decline rates. Nevertheless, we
show that NIR light curves can be reasonably fit with a template, especially if
the observations begin within 5 days after NIR maximum. For the subset of 13
objects in our dataset that excludes the highly reddened and fast declining SNe
Ia, and includes only those objects for which NIR observations began prior to
five days after maximum light, we find modest evidence for a peak
luminosity-decline rate relation in Y, and stronger evidence in J and H. Using
Rv values differing from the canonical value of 3.1 is shown to have little
effect on the results. A Hubble diagram is presented for the NIR bands and the
B band. The resulting scatter for the combined NIR bands is 0.13 mag, while the
B band produces a scatter of 0.22 mag. The data suggest that applying a
correction to SNe Ia peak luminosities for decline rate is likely to be
beneficial in the J and H bands to make SNe Ia more precise distance
indicators, but of only marginal importance in the Y band.

sedimentation of colloidal particles that interact through short-ranged
attractions. By employing a hybrid molecular dynamics simulation method we
demonstrate that the average sedimentation velocity changes from a non-
monotonic dependence on packing fraction {\phi} at low Pe numbers, to a
monotonic decrease with {\phi} at higher Pe numbers. At low Pe number the pair
correlation functions are close to their equilibrium values, but as the Pe
number increases, important deviations from equilibrium forms are observed.
Although the attractive forces we employ are not strong enough to form
permanent clusters, they do induce transient clusters whose behaviour is also
affected by Pe number. In particular, clusters are more likely to fragment and
less likely to aggregate at larger Pe numbers, and the probability of finding
larger clusters decreases with increasing Pe number. Interestingly, the
life-time of the clusters is more or less independent of Pe number in the range
we study. Instead, the change in cluster distribution occurs because larger
clusters are less likely to form with increasing Pe number. These results
illustrate some of the subtleties that occur in the crossover from equilibrium
like to purely non-equilibrium behaviour as the balance between convective and
thermal forces changes.

observation suggesting that BAL quasars are more likely to be seen farther from

width of the distribution. Utilizing a few different relationships between

New particles
with color, if within the LHC energy reach, will be copiously produced. One
such particle is a diquark, having the quantum numbers of two quarks, and can
be a scalar or a vector. It will decay to two light quarks, or two top quarks,
or a top and a light quark, (up or down type depending on the quantum number of
the produced diquark). If singly produced, it can be looked for as a dijet
resonance, or as giving extra contribution to the single top production or tt
production. In this work, we consider a color sextet vector diquark having the
quantum number of (ud) type, its resonance production, and the subsequent decay
to tb, giving rise to excess contribution to the single top production. Even
though the diquark mass is large, its strong resonance production dominate the
weak production of tb for a wide range of the diquark mass. Also its subsequent
decay to tb produce a very hard b-jet compared to the usual electroweak
production. In addition, the missing energy in the final state event is much
larger from the massive diquark decays. Thus, with suitable cuts, the final
state with b, bar{b} and a charged lepton together with large missing energy
stands out compared to the Standard Model background. We make a detailed study
of both the signal and the background. We find that such a diquark is
accessible at the 7 TeV LHC upto a mass of about 3.3 TeV with the luminosity 1
fb^{-1}, while the reach goes up to about 4.3 TeV with a luminosity of 10
fb^{-1}.

  Observations","24 pages, 9 figures",,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information exchange systems differ in many ways, but all share a common
vulnerability to selfish behavior and free-riding. In this paper, we build
incentives schemes based on social norms. Social norms prescribe a social
strategy for the users in the system to follow and deploy reputation schemes to
reward or penalize users depending on their behaviors. Because users in these
systems often have only limited capability to observe the global system
information, e.g. the reputation distribution of the users participating in the
system, their beliefs about the reputation distribution are heterogeneous and
biased. Such belief heterogeneity causes a positive fraction of users to not
follow the social strategy. In such practical scenarios, the standard
equilibrium analysis deployed in the economics literature is no longer directly
applicable and hence, the system design needs to consider these differences. To
investigate how the system designs need to change when the participating users
have only limited observations, we focus on a simple social norm with binary
reputation labels but allow adjusting the punishment severity through
randomization. First, we model the belief heterogeneity using a suitable
Bayesian belief function. Next, we formalize the users' optimal decision
problems and derive in which scenarios they follow the prescribed social
strategy. With this result, we then study the system dynamics and formally
define equilibrium in the sense that the system is stable when users
strategically optimize their decisions. By rigorously studying two specific
cases where users' belief distribution is constant or is linearly influenced by
the true reputation distribution, we prove that the optimal reputation update
rule is to choose the mildest possible punishment. This result is further
confirmed for higher order beliefs in simulations.

produced in heavy-ion collisions. In this thesis we extend the well-established
and successful zero temperature framework of Non-Relativistic (NR) Effective
Field Theories (EFTs) (NRQCD, pNRQCD) for the study of heavy quarkonia
(production, spectroscopy, decays, ...) to finite temperatures. This is
achieved by integrating out in sequence the scales that characterize a NR bound
state and those that are typical of a thermal medium, in the possible
hierarchies that are relevant for quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma. Within
this framework we show how the potential that governs the evolution of the
quark-antiquark pair is derived from QCD in a modern and rigorous way, thereby
bridging the gap between phenomenological potential models and QCD. We show how
the EFTs can be systematically improved and how effects that cannot be encoded
in a potential arise naturally in the EFT, giving rise to new mechanisms of
dissociation. We use this EFT framework to compute the spectrum and width of
quarkonia in a particular setting that is relevant for the phenomenology of the
ground states of bottomonium at the LHC. We also analyze within this framework
the correlator of Polyakov loops, which is related to the thermodynamical free
energy of heavy quark-antiquark pairs in the medium. As such, lattice
computations thereof were frequently used as input for potential models. With
our approach we are able to clarify the relation between these free energies
and the real-time potential describing the dynamics of quarkonia, finding that
the two are different not only in the important imaginary parts, that the
former completely lack, but also in the real parts.

from the conventional 'topological observability' based approaches, this paper
advocates a much more refined, information-theoretic criterion, namely the
mutual information (MI) between the PMU measurements and the power system
states. The proposed MI criterion can not only include the full system
observability as a special case, but also can rigorously model the remaining
uncertainties in the power system states with PMU measurements, so as to
generate highly informative PMU configurations. Further, the MI criterion can
facilitate robust PMU placement by explicitly modeling probabilistic PMU
outages. We propose a greedy PMU placement algorithm, and show that it achieves
an approximation ratio of (1-1/e) for any PMU placement budget. We further show
that the performance is the best that one can achieve in practice, in the sense
that it is NP-hard to achieve any approximation ratio beyond (1-1/e). Such
performance guarantee makes the greedy algorithm very attractive in the
practical scenario of multi-stage installations for utilities with limited
budgets. Finally, simulation results demonstrate near-optimal performance of

observed emission line fluxes imply total beam-averaged column densities of ~

largest of its kind. This sample is dominated (70%) by star-forming (SF)
galaxies from the blue sequence, with total IR luminosities in the range
~10^8-10^12 L_sun. We identify which stellar populations are responsible for
most of the 12um emission. We find that most (~80%) of the 12um emission in SF
galaxies is produced by stellar populations younger than 0.6 Gyr. In contrast,
the 12um emission in weak AGN (L[OIII]<10^7 L_sun) is produced by older stars,
with ages of ~1-3 Gyr. We find that L_[12um] linearly correlates with stellar
mass for SF galaxies. At fixed 12um luminosity, weak AGN deviate toward higher
masses since they tend to be hosted by massive, early-type galaxies with older
stellar populations. Star-forming galaxies and weak AGN follow different
L_[12um]-SFR (star formation rate) relations, with weak AGN showing excess 12um
emission at low SFR (~0.02-1 M_sun/yr). This is likely due to dust grains
heated by older stars. While the specific star formation rate (SSFR) of SF
galaxies is nearly constant, the SSFR of weak AGN decreases by ~3 orders of
magnitude, reflecting the very different star formation efficiencies between SF
galaxies and massive, early-type galaxies. Stronger type II AGN in our sample
(L_[OIII]>10^7 L_sun), act as an extension of massive SF galaxies, connecting
the SF and weak AGN sequences. This suggests a picture where galaxies form
stars normally until an AGN (possibly after a starburst episode) starts to
gradually quench the SF activity. We also find that 4.6-12um color is a useful
first-order indicator of SF activity in a galaxy when no other data are
available.

following: (1) DM fractions increase systematically with both structural
parameters and mass proxies, as in previous studies, and decrease with central
stellar density. 2) All correlations involving DM fractions are caused by two
fundamental ones with galaxy effective radius and central velocity dispersion.
These correlations are independent of each other, so that ETGs populate a
central-DM plane (DMP), i.e. a correlation among fraction of total-to-stellar
mass, effective radius, and velocity dispersion, whose scatter along the
total-to-stellar mass axis amounts to \sim 0.15 dex. (3) In general, under the
assumption of an isothermal or a constant M/L profile for the total mass
distribution, a Chabrier IMF is favoured with respect to a bottom-heavier
Salpeter IMF, as the latter produces negative (i.e. unphysical) DM fractions
for more than 50% of the galaxies in our sample. For a Chabrier IMF, the DM
estimates agree with \LambdaCDM toy-galaxy models based on contracted DM-halo
density profiles. We also find agreement with predictions from hydrodynamical
simulations. (4) The central DM content of ETGs does not depend significantly
on the environment where galaxies reside, with group and field ETGs having
similar DM trends. (Abridged)

one considers non-minimal theories, i.e., theories in which the electromagnetic

By considering a cosmological model where the dark sector, i.e., the dark

taking into account a non-minimal coupling theory for the electromagnetic

therefore conclude that interactions with the intra-cluster medium drive the
evolution of SFRs in cluster galaxies. A merged sample of galaxies from the
five most complete clusters shows <SFR>\propto(R/R200)^(1.3+/-0.7) for galaxies
with R/R200<0.4. A decline in the fraction of SFGs toward the cluster center
contributes most of this effect, but it is accompanied by a reduction in SFRs
among star-forming galaxies (SFGs) near the cluster center. The increase in the
fraction of SFGs toward larger R/R200 and the isolation of SFGs with reduced
SFRs near the cluster center are consistent with ram pressure stripping as the
mechanism to truncate star formation in galaxy clusters. We conclude that
stripping drives the properties of SFGs over the range of radii we examine. We
also find that galaxies near the cluster center are more massive than galaxies
farther out in the cluster at ~3.5\sigma, which suggests that cluster galaxies
experience dynamical relaxation during the course of their evolution.

the leading-order effective 4-body interaction and consistently include
finite-range corrections for realistic 2-body interactions. The leading-order,
effective 3- and 4-body interaction energies are U3 = -(0.85576...)(a/l)^2 +
2.7921(1)(a/l)^3 + O[(a/l)^4] and U4 = +(2.43317...)(a/l)^3 + O[(a\l)^4], where
w and l are the harmonic oscillator frequency and length, respectively, and
energies are in units of hbar*w. The one-standard deviation error 0.0001 for
the third-order coefficient in U3 is due to numerical uncertainty in estimating
a slowly converging sum; the other two coefficients are either analytically or
numerically exact. The effective 3- and 4-body interactions can play an
important role in the dynamics of tightly confined and strongly correlated
systems. We also performed numerical simulations for a finite-range boson-boson
potential, and it was comparison to the zero-range predictions which revealed
that finite-range effects must be taken into account for a realistic
third-order treatment. In particular, we show that the energy-dependent
pseudopotential accurately captures, through third order, the finite-range
physics, and in combination with the multi-body effective interactions gives
excellent agreement with the numerical simulations, validating our theoretical

blurring effect of diffraction imposes a fundamental limit on the image quality
from any single telescope. Interferometry allows light collected at
widely-separated telescopes to be combined in order to synthesize an aperture
much larger than an individual telescope thereby improving angular resolution
by orders of magnitude. Radio and millimeter wave astronomers depend on
interferometry to achieve image quality on par with conventional visible and
infrared telescopes. Interferometers at visible and infrared wavelengths extend
angular resolution below the milli-arcsecond level to open up unique research
areas in imaging stellar surfaces and circumstellar environments.
  In this chapter the basic principles of interferometry are reviewed with an
emphasis on the common features for radio and optical observing. While many
techniques are common to interferometers of all wavelengths, crucial
differences are identified that will help new practitioners avoid unnecessary
confusion and common pitfalls. Concepts essential for writing observing
proposals and for planning observations are described, depending on the science
wavelength, angular resolution, and field of view required. Atmospheric and
ionospheric turbulence degrades the longest-baseline observations by
significantly reducing the stability of interference fringes. Such
instabilities represent a persistent challenge, and the basic techniques of
phase-referencing and phase closure have been developed to deal with them.
Synthesis imaging with large observing datasets has become a routine and
straightforward process at radio observatories, but remains challenging for
optical facilities. In this context the commonly-used image reconstruction
algorithms CLEAN and MEM are presented. Lastly, a concise overview of current
facilities is included as an appendix.

find a significant trend towards steeper mass profiles (parameterized by the
power-law density model with rho ~ r^[-gamma]) at later cosmic times, with
magnitude d<gamma>/dz = -0.60 +/- 0.15. We show that the combined lens-galaxy
sample is consistent with a non-evolving distribution of stellar velocity
dispersions. Considering possible additional dependence of <gamma> on
lens-galaxy stellar mass, effective radius, and Sersic index, we find marginal
evidence for shallower mass profiles at higher masses and larger sizes, but
with a significance that is sub-dominant to the redshift dependence. Using the
results of published Monte Carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys, we
verify that our mass-profile evolution result cannot be explained by lensing
selection biases as a function of redshift. Interpreted as a true evolutionary
signal, our result suggests that major dry mergers involving off-axis
trajectories play a significant role in the evolution of the average
mass-density structure of massive early-type galaxies over the past 6 Gyr. We
also consider an alternative non-evolutionary hypothesis based on variations in
the strong-lensing measurement aperture with redshift, which would imply the
detection of an ""inflection zone"" marking the transition between the
baryon-dominated and dark-matter halo-dominated regions of the lens galaxies.
Further observations of the combined SLACS+BELLS sample can constrain this
picture more precisely, and enable a more detailed investigation of the
multivariate dependences of galaxy mass structure across cosmic time.

the belief propagation threshold of the ensemble to essentially the maximum

convolutional LDPC ensembles, originally introduced by Felstrom and Zigangirov,
perform so well over this channel. We show that the equivalent result holds
true for transmission over general binary-input memoryless output-symmetric
channels. More precisely, given a desired error probability and a gap to
capacity, we can construct a spatially coupled ensemble which fulfills these
constraints universally on this class of channels under belief propagation
decoding. In fact, most codes in that ensemble have that property. The
quantifier universal refers to the single ensemble/code which is good for all
channels but we assume that the channel is known at the receiver. The key
technical result is a proof that under belief propagation decoding spatially
coupled ensembles achieve essentially the area threshold of the underlying
uncoupled ensemble. We conclude by discussing some interesting open problems.

approach is based on scalar quantization, followed by two forms of tight
packing in floating-point (one of which is proposed in this paper) that allow
for concurrent calculation of multiple results. We illustrate how our approach
can operate as an optional pre- and post-processing layer for off-the-shelf
optimized convolution routines. This is useful for multimedia applications that
are tolerant to processing imprecision and for cases where the input signals
are inherently noisy (error tolerant multimedia applications). Indicative
experimental results with a digital music matching system and an MPEG-7 audio

increase in processing throughput against optimized (full-precision)
convolution with virtually no effect in the accuracy of the results. Based on
marginal statistics of the input data, it is also shown how the throughput and

(EVN) to perform phase-referenced VLBI observations of the three most powerful
maser transitions associated with the high-mass star-forming region
G28.87+0.07: the 22.2 GHz H$_{2}$O, 6.7 GHz CH$_{3}$OH, and 1.665 GHz OH lines.
We also performed VLA observations of the radio continuum emission at 1.3 and
3.6 cm and Subaru observations of the continuum emission at 24.5 $\mu$m. Two
centimeter continuum sources are detected and one of them (named ""HMC"") is
compact and placed at the center of the observed distribution of H$_{2}$O,
CH$_{3}$OH and OH masers. The bipolar distribution of line-of-sight (l.o.s)
velocities and the pattern of the proper motions suggest that the water masers
are driven by a (proto)stellar jet interacting with the dense circumstellar
gas. The same jet could both excite the centimeter continuum source named ""HMC""
(interpreted as free-free emission from shocked gas) and power the molecular
outflow observed at larger scales -- although one cannot exclude that the
free-free continuum is rather originating from a hypercompact \ion{H}{2}
region. At 24.5 $\mu$m, we identify two objects separated along the north-south
direction, whose absolute positions agree with those of the two VLA continuum
sources. We establish that $\sim$90% of the luminosity of the region
($\sim$\times10^{5} L_\sun$) is coming from the radio source ""HMC"", which
confirms the existence of an embedded massive young stellar object (MYSO)
exciting the masers and possibly still undergoing heavy accretion from the
surrounding envelope.

seizures. It affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. In majority of
the cases accurate diagnosis of the disease can be made without using any
technologically advanced techniques and seizures are controlled using standard
treatment in the form of regular use of anti-epileptic drugs. However,
approximately 30% of the patients suffer from medically refractory epilepsy,
wherein seizures are not controlled by the use of anti-epileptic drugs.
Understanding the mechanisms underlying these forms of drug resistant epileptic
seizures and the development of alternative effective treatment strategies is a
fundamental challenge in modern epilepsy research. In this context, the need
for integrative approaches combining various modalities of treatment strategies
is high. Computational modeling has gained prominence in recent years as an
important tool for tackling the complexity of the epileptic phenomenon. In this
review article we present a survey of different computational models for
epilepsy and discuss how computer models can aid in our understanding of brain
mechanisms in epilepsy and the development of new epilepsy treatment protocols.

hypothesis that all minimizers connecting $x$ to $y$ are strongly normal, i.e.\
all pieces of the trajectory are not abnormal. Our result is a refinement of
the one of Leandre $4t\log p_t(x,y)\to -d^2(x,y)$ for $t\to 0$, in which only
the leading exponential term is detected. Our results are obtained by extending
an idea of Molchanov from the Riemannian to the sub-Riemannian case, and some
details we get appear to be new even in the Riemannian context. These results
permit us to obtain properties of the sub-Riemannian distance starting from
those of the heat kernel and vice versa. For the Grushin plane endowed with the
Euclidean volume we get the expansion $p_t(x,y)\sim t^{-5/4}\exp(-d^2(x,y)/4t)$

Events with low hadronic final state energy $\nu<\nu_{cut}$ (of 1, 2 and 5 GeV)
were used by the MINOS collaboration to determine the neutrino flux in their
measurements of neutrino ($\nu_\mu$) and antineutrino ($\nub_\mu$) total cross
sections. The lowest $\nu_\mu$ energy for which the method was used in MINOS is
3.5 GeV, and the lowest $\nub_\mu$ energy is 6 GeV. At these energies, the
cross sections are dominated by inelastic processes. We investigate the
application of the method to determine the neutrino flux for $\nu_\mu$,
$\nub_\mu$ energies as low as 0.7 GeV where the cross sections are dominated by
quasielastic scattering and $\Delta$(1232) resonance production. We find that
the method can be extended to low energies by using $\nu_{cut}$ values of 0.25
and 0.50 GeV, which is feasible in fully active neutrino detectors such as
MINERvA.
