on the Debeye length of the electric double layer. Expressions for friction

over distributions against algorithms that can be implemented using access to a
statistical query oracle. For such algorithms, access to the input distribution
is limited to obtaining an estimate of the expectation of any given function on
a sample drawn randomly from the input distribution, rather than directly
accessing samples. Most natural algorithms of interest in theory and in
practice, e.g., moments-based methods, local search, standard iterative methods
for convex optimization, MCMC and simulated annealing can be implemented in
this framework. Our framework is based on, and generalizes, the statistical
query model in learning theory (Kearns, 1998).
  Our main application is a nearly optimal lower bound on the complexity of any
statistical query algorithm for detecting planted bipartite clique
distributions (or planted dense subgraph distributions) when the planted clique
has size $O(n^{1/2-\delta})$ for any constant $\delta > 0$. The assumed
hardness of variants of these problems has been used to prove hardness of
several other problems and as a guarantee for security in cryptographic
applications. Our lower bounds provide concrete evidence of hardness, thus
supporting these assumptions.

feedback, without exogenous driving. The World Trade Network (WTN) is one of
the few empirically well documented examples of self-organizing networks: its
topology strongly depends on the GDP of world countries, which in turn depends
on the structure of trade. Therefore, understanding which are the key
topological properties of the WTN that deviate from randomness provides direct
empirical information about the structural effects of self-organization. Here,
using an analytical pattern-detection method that we have recently proposed, we
study the occurrence of triadic ""motifs"" (subgraphs of three vertices) in the
WTN between 1950 and 2000. We find that, unlike other properties, motifs are
not explained by only the in- and out-degree sequences. By contrast, they are
completely explained if also the numbers of reciprocal edges are taken into
account. This implies that the self-organization process underlying the
evolution of the WTN is almost completely encoded into the dyadic structure,
which strongly depends on reciprocity.

considerable experimental efforts to constrain uncertainties at temperatures
relevant for stellar nucleosynthesis. In order to investigate the effect of an
enhanced carbon burning rate on massive star structure and nucleosynthesis, new
stellar evolution models and their yields are presented exploring the impact of
three different 12C + 12C reaction rates. Non-rotating stellar models were
generated using the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code and were later post-processed
with the NuGrid Multi-zone Post-Processing Network tool. The enhanced rate
causes core carbon burning to be ignited more promptly and at lower
temperature. This reduces the neutrino losses, which increases the core carbon
burning lifetime. An increased carbon burning rate also increases the upper
initial mass limit for which a star exhibits a convective carbon core. Carbon
shell burning is also affected, with fewer convective-shell episodes and
convection zones that tend to be larger in mass. Consequently, the chance of an
overlap between the ashes of carbon core burning and the following carbon shell
convection zones is increased, which can cause a portion of the ashes of carbon
core burning to be included in the carbon shell. Therefore, during the
supernova explosion, the ejecta will be enriched by s-process nuclides
synthesized from the carbon core s process. The yields were used to estimate
the weak s-process component in order to compare with the solar system
abundance distribution. The enhanced rate models were found to produce a
significant proportion of Kr, Sr, Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, Pd and Cd in the weak
component, which is primarily the signature of the carbon-core s process.
Consequently, it is shown that the production of isotopes in the Kr-Sr region
can be used to constrain the 12C + 12C rate using the current branching ratio
for a- and p-exit channels.

the Schroedinger eigenvalue problem on an infinite domain. This paper examines
the consequences of imposing the boundary conditions on a finite domain. As is
the case with regular Hermitian Sturm-Liouville problems, the eigenvalues of
the PT-symmetric Sturm-Liouville problem grow like $n^2$ for large $n$.
However, the novelty is that a PT eigenvalue problem on a finite domain
typically exhibits a sequence of critical points at which pairs of eigenvalues
cease to be real and become complex conjugates of one another. For the
potentials considered here this sequence of critical points is associated with
a turning point on the imaginary axis in the complex plane. WKB analysis is
used to calculate the asymptotic behaviors of the real eigenvalues and the
locations of the critical points. The method turns out to be surprisingly
accurate even at low energies.

Fe, Co and Ni, leads to reduction of the $C^\prime$ elastic constant and
increase of elastic anisotropy A=$C_{44}/C^\prime$. Alloying W with a group
VIIIA transition metal changes the structure of the dislocation core from
symmetric to asymmetric, similar to results obtained for W$_{1-x}$Re$_{x}$

was modulated in Ohmic conditions between 200kA and 300kA with 30ms rise time,
several times faster than its time constant L/R\approx200ms. The model explains
the most salient features of the plasma current transients without requiring
detailed or explicit information about resistivity profiles. This proves that
lumped parameter modeling approach can be used to predict the time evolution of
bulk plasma properties such as plasma inductance or current with reasonable
accuracy; at least in Ohmic conditions without external heating and current
drive sources.

which combines an expressive shape analysis style abstract domain with
efficient and simple points-to style transfer functions. Using data from
empirical studies on the runtime heap structures and the programmatic idioms
used in modern object-oriented languages we construct a heap analysis with the
following characteristics: (1) it can express a rich set of structural, shape,
and sharing properties which are not provided by a classic points-to analysis
and that are useful for optimization and error detection applications (2) it
uses efficient, weakly-updating, set-based transfer functions which enable the
analysis to be more robust and scalable than a shape analysis and (3) it can be
used as the basis for a scalable interprocedural analysis that produces precise
results in practice.
  The analysis has been implemented for .Net bytecode and using this
implementation we evaluate both the runtime cost and the precision of the
results on a number of well known benchmarks and real world programs. Our
experimental evaluations show that the domain defined in this paper is capable
of precisely expressing the majority of the connectivity, shape, and sharing
properties that occur in practice and, despite the use of weak updates, the

However and to the best of our knowledge, the direct links between these two

far. In this paper, we propose novel relations between the ergodic capacity and
the average bit error rate of an overall communication system using binary
modulation schemes for signaling with a limited bandwidth and operating over
generalized fading channels. More specifically, we show that these two

quasar outflows, the lifetimes of such compact absorbers are too short for them
to be direct ejecta from a nuclear wind. Instead, I argue that the absorbing
clouds must be transient and created in situ. Following arguments detailed by
Faucher-Giguere, Quataert, & Murray (2011), I show that a model in which the
cool absorbers form in radiative shocks arising when a quasar blast wave
impacts an interstellar cloud along the line of sight successfully explains the
key observed properties. Using this radiative shock model, the outflow kinetic
luminosities for three luminous quasars are estimated to be Edot,k~2-5% L_AGN
(with corresponding momentum fluxes Pdot~2-15 L_AGN/c), consistent with
feedback models of the M-sigma relation. These energetics are similar to those
recently inferred of molecular outflows in local ultra-luminous infrared
galaxies and in post-starburt winds, suggesting that active galactic nuclei
(AGN) are capable of driving such outflows. Radiative shocks probably affect
the multiphase structure of outflows in a range of other systems, including
narrower and higher-ionization quasar absorption lines, and compact
intergalactic absorbers ejected by star formation and AGN activity.

dispersions, and an interstellar medium that has not been fully processed,
provide a local analog to conditions of galaxy interactions in the earlier
universe. The frequent and prolonged gravitational encounters that occur in
compact groups affect the evolution of the constituent galaxies in a myriad of
ways, for example gas processing and star formation. Recently, a statistically
significant ""gap"" has been discovered mid-infrared IRAC colorspace of compact
group galaxies. This gap is not seen in field samples and is a new example of
how the compact group environment may affect the evolution of member galaxies.
In order to investigate the origin and nature of this gap, we have compiled a
sample of 49 compact groups. We find that a statistically significant deficit
of galaxies in this gap region of IRAC colorspace is persistant in this sample,
lending support to the hypothesis that the compact group environment inhibits
moderate SSFRs. We note a curvature in the colorspace distribution, which is
fully consistent with increasing dust temperature as the activity in a galaxy
increases. This full sample of 49 compact groups allows us to subdivide the
data according to physical properties of the groups. An analysis of these
subsamples indicates that neither projected physical diameter nor density show
a trend in colorspace within the values represented by this sample. We
hypothesize that the apparent lack of a trend is due to the relatively small
range of properties in this sample. Thus, the relative influence of stochastic
effects becomes dominant. We analyze spectral energy distributions of member
galaxies as a function of their location in colorspace and find that galaxies
in different regions of MIR colorspace contain dust with varying temperatures
and/or PAH emission.

luminosity and HI mass of 3e39 erg/s and 2e8 M_sun, respectively. The X-ray
data are consistent with efficient ram pressure stripping of the hot gas halos
of early-type galaxies near the group core, but no X-ray tails are seen and the
limited statistics preclude strong conclusions. The HI results suggest moderate
HI mass loss from the group members when compared to similar field galaxies.
Six of the 20 HI-detected group members show HI evidence of ongoing
interactions with other galaxies or with the intragroup medium. Suggestive
evidence is further seen for galaxies with close neighbors in position-velocity
space to show relatively low HI content, consistent with tidal removal of HI.
The results thus indicate removal of both hot and cold gas from the group
members via a combination of ram pressure stripping and tidal interactions. We
also find that 16 of the 20 HI detections occur on one side of the group,
reflecting an unusual morphological segregation whose origin remains unclear.

extrapolate the high energy model directly to lower energies for each pulse
reveal that a spectral break is required between the optical regime and 0.3 keV

emission alone is insufficient to describe all morphology seen in the optical

and IR and permitting each pulse to have an independent low energy spectral
indices we produce an alternative scenario which better describes the optical
light curve. This, however, does not describe the spectral shape of GRB 080310

composite supersymmetric theories at the bottom of the conformal window can

naturalness. With a non-tuned choice of parameters, the only superpartners
below one TeV will be the partners of the Higgs, the electroweak gauge bosons,
the left-handed top and bottom, and the right-handed top, which are precisely
the particles needed to make weak scale supersymmetry breaking natural. In the
model considered here, these correspond to composite (or partially composite)
degrees of freedom via Seiberg duality, while the other MSSM fields, with their
heavier superpartners, are elementary. The key observation is that at or near
the edge of the conformal window, soft supersymmetry breaking scalar and
gaugino masses are transmitted only to fundamental particles at leading order.
With the potential that arises from the duality, a Higgs with a 125 GeV mass,
with nearly SM production rates, is naturally accommodated without tuning. The
lightest ordinary superpartner is either the lightest stop or the lightest
neutralino. If it is the stop, it is natural for it to be almost degenerate
with the top, in which case it decays to top by emitting a very soft gravitino,
making it quite difficult to find this mode at the LHC and more challenging to
find SUSY in general, yielding a simple realization of the stealth
supersymmetry idea. We analyze four benchmark spectra in detail.

(dust obscuration), compared to values reported for the general star-forming

find that nonlinear fluid effects, which reduce the effective viscosities in

This occurs when the Shakura & Sunyaev dimensionless viscosity parameter alpha

45 degrees. The break can be a long-lived feature, propagating outwards in the
disc on the usual alignment timescale, after which the disc is fully co- or

systems where we know the inclination of the outer accretion disc to the line

Cosmological observations suggest that most matter will be diluted away by the
cosmological expansion, with the rest collapsing into supermassive black holes.
The likely future state of our local universe is a supermassive black hole
slowly evaporating in an empty universe dominated by a positive cosmological
constant. We describe some overlooked features of how the cosmological horizon
responds to the black hole evaporation. The presence of a black hole depresses
the entropy of the cosmological horizon by an amount proportional to the
geometric mean of the entropies of the black hole and cosmological horizons. As
the black hole evaporates and loses its mass in the process, the total entropy
increases obeying the second law of thermodynamics. The entropy is produced by
the heat from the black hole flowing across the extremely cold cosmological
horizon. Once the evaporation is complete, the universe becomes empty de Sitter
space that (in the presence of a true cosmological constant) is the maximum
entropy thermodynamic equilibrium state. We propose that flat Minkowski space
is an improper limit of this process which obscures the thermodynamics. The
cosmological constant should be regarded not only as an energy scale, but also
as a scale for the maximum entropy of a universe. In this context, flat
Minkowski space is indistinguishable from de Sitter with extremely small
cosmological constant, yielding a divergent entropy. This introduces an
unregulated infinity in black hole thermodynamics calculations, giving possibly
misleading results.

between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC, respectively) and
our Milky Way (MW) in light of recent high precision proper motions
(Kallivayalil et al. 2006a,b). Given the new velocities, cosmological
simulations of structure formation favor a scenario where the Magellanic Clouds
(MCs) are currently on their first infall towards our Galaxy (Boylan-Kolchin et
al. 2011, Busha et al. 2011). We illustrate here that the observed irregular
morphology and internal kinematics of the MCs (in gas and stars) are naturally
explained by interactions between the LMC and SMC, rather than gravitational
interactions with the MW. This picture further supports a first infall scenario
(Besla et a. 2007). In particular, we demonstrate that the Magellanic Stream, a
band of HI gas trailing behind the MCs 150 degrees across the sky, can be
accounted for by the action of LMC tides on the SMC before the system was
accreted by the MW. We further demonstrate that the off-center, warped stellar
bar of the LMC and its one-armed spiral, can be naturally explained by a recent
direct collision with the SMC. Such structures are key morphological
characteristics of a class of galaxies referred to as Magellanic Irregulars (de
Vaucouleurs & Freeman 1972), the majority of which are not associated with
massive spiral galaxies. We infer that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions are
important drivers for the morphological evolution of Magellanic Irregulars and
can dramatically affect the efficiency of baryon removal from dwarf galaxies
via the formation of extended tidal bridges and tails. Such interactions are
important not only for the evolution of dwarf galaxies but also have direct
consequences for the buildup of baryons in our own MW, as LMC-mass systems are
believed to be the dominant building blocks of MW-type halos.

such a model is dominated by the disk self-gravity supported by the radiation
pressure of ionizing starlight on gas. Constraining our model to reproduce the
UV luminosity function of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs), we limit the available
parameter-space to wind mass-loading factors 1--4 times the canonical value for
momentum-driven winds. We then focus our study by exploring the effects of
different angular momentum transport mechanisms in the galactic disk and find
that accretion driven by gravitational torques, such as from linear spiral
waves or non-linear orbit crossings, can build up black hole masses by z=6
consistent with the canonical M-sigma relation with a duty cycle of unity,
while accretion mediated by a local viscosity such as in an alpha-disk results
in negligible BH accretion. Both gravitational torque models produce X-ray
emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in high-redshift LBGs in excess of
the estimated contribution from high-mass X-ray binaries. Using a recent
analysis of deep Chandra observations by Cowie et al., we can already begin to
rule out the most extreme regions of our parameter-space: the inflow velocity
of gas through the disk must either be less than one percent of the disk
circular velocity or the X-ray luminosity of the AGN must be substantially

at the fundamental level when GIM mechanism is absent as in numerous Z' models,
gauged flavour models with new heavy neutral gauge bosons and Left-Right
symmetric models with heavy neutral scalars. They can also be generated at one
loop in models having GIM at the fundamental level and MFV of which Two-Higgs
Doublet models with and without SUSY are the best known examples. In models
containing vectorial heavy fermions that mix with the standard chiral quarks
and models in which Z and SM neutral Higgs H mix with new heavy gauge bosons
and scalars also tree-level Z and SM neutral Higgs contributions to Delta F=2
processes are possible. In all these extensions new local operators are
generated having Wilson coefficients that are generally much stronger affected
by RG QCD effects than it is the case of the SM operators. The new aspect of
our work is the calculation of O(alpha_s) corrections to matching conditions
for the Wilson coefficients of the contributing operators in the NDR-MS scheme

unphysical scale and renormalization scheme dependences in the existing NLO

analytic formulae for the P_i^a QCD factors that include both hadronic matrix
elements of contributing operators and RG evolution from high energy to low
energy scales. For the masses of heavy gauge bosons and scalars O(1)TeV the
remaining unphysical scale dependences for the mixing amplitudes are reduced
typically from 10-25%, depending on the operator considered, down to 1-2%.

explained by a relatively light dark matter particle with an annihilation cross
section consistent with that predicted for a simple thermal relic (sigma v ~
10^-26 cm^3/s) and with a distribution in the halo of the Milky Way consistent
with that predicted from simulations. Astrophysical explanations for the gamma
ray and synchrotron signals, in contrast, have not been successful in
accommodating these observations. Similarly, the phase of the annual modulation
observed by DAMA/LIBRA (and now supported by CoGeNT) is inconsistent with all
known or postulated modulating backgrounds, but are in good agreement with
expectations for dark matter scattering. This scenario is consistent with all
existing indirect and collider constraints, as well as the constraints placed

response of liquid xenon to very low-energy nuclear recoils is somewhat
suppressed relative to previous evaluations, or if the dark matter possesses

1. Some earlier results of Ozden's papers in terms of unification of the
multiple twisted Euler and Genocchi numbers and polynomials associated with
p-adic q-integral on Zp at q = 1 can be deduced. We apply the method of
generating function and p-adic q-integral representation on Zp, which are
exploited to derive further classes of Euler polynomials and Genocchi
polynomials. To be more precise we summarize our results as follows, we obtain
some relations between H.Ozden's generating function and fermionic p-adic
q-integral on Zp at q = 1. Furthermore we derive Witt's type formula for the
unification of twisted Euler and Genocchi polynomials. Also we derive
distribution formula (Multiplication Theorem) for multiple twisted Euler and
Genocchi numbers and polynomials associated with p-adic q-integral on Zp at q =
1 which yields a deeper insight into the effectiveness of this type of
generalizations. Furthermore we define unification of multiple twisted zeta
function and we obtain an interpolation formula between unification of multiple
twisted zeta function and unification of the multiple twisted Euler and
Genocchi numbers at negative integer. Our new generating function possess a
number of interesting properties which we state in this paper.

Part I of The geometry of blueprints, we introduce the class of \emph{Tits
morphisms} between blue schemes. The resulting \emph{Tits category}
$\textup{Sch}_\mathcal{T}$ comes together with a base extension to (semiring)
schemes and the so-called \emph{Weyl extension} to sets.
  We prove for $\mathcal{G}$ in a wide class of Chevalley groups---which
includes the special and general linear groups, symplectic and special
orthogonal groups, and all types of adjoint groups---that a linear
representation of $\mathcal{G}$ defines a model $G$ in
$\textup{Sch}_\mathcal{T}$ whose Weyl extension is the Weyl group $W$ of
$\mathcal{G}$. We call such models \emph{Tits-Weyl models}. The potential of
Tits-Weyl models lies in \textit{(a)} their intrinsic definition that is given
by a linear representation; \textit{(b)} the (yet to be formulated) unified
approach towards thick and thin geometries; and \textit{(c)} the extension of a
Chevalley group to a functor on blueprints, which makes it, in particular,
possible to consider Chevalley groups over semirings. This opens applications
to idempotent analysis and tropical geometry.

formation instability is of importance to understand the final evolution both
of the first stars and of contemporary stars. The criterion to enter the pair
instability regime in density and temperature is basically controlled by the
mass of the oxygen core. The main sequence masses that produce a given oxygen
core mass are, in turn, dependent on metallicity, mass loss, and convective and
rotationally-induced mixing. We examine the evolution of massive stars to
determine the minimum main sequence mass that can encounter pair-instability
effects, either a pulsational pair instability (PPISN) or a full-fledged
pair-instability supernova (PISN). We concentrate on zero-metallicity stars
with no mass loss subject to the Schwarzschild criterion for convective
instability, but also explore solar metallicity and mass loss and the Ledoux
criterion. As expected, for sufficiently strong rotationally-induced mixing,
the minimum main sequence mass is encountered for conditions that induce
effectively homogeneous evolution such that the original mass is converted
almost entirely to helium and then to oxygen. For this case, we find that the
minimum main sequence mass is ~40 Msun to encounter PPISN and ~65 Msun to
encounter a PISN. When mass-loss is taken into account those mass limits become
~50 Msun for PPISN and ~80 Msun for PISN progenitors. The implications of these
results for the first stars and for contemporary supernovae is discussed.

This applies also to holographic models of hadron physics. In a class of such
models, like the generalized Sakai-Sugimoto model, baryons take the form of
instantons of the effective flavor gauge theory that resides on probe flavor
branes. In this paper we study the phase structure of baryonic crystals by
analyzing discrete periodic configurations of such instantons. We find that
instanton configurations exhibit a series of ""popcorn"" transitions upon
increasing the density. Through these transitions normal (3D) lattices expand
into the transverse dimension, eventually becoming a higher dimensional (4D)
multi-layer lattice at large densities.
  We consider 3D lattices of zero size instantons as well as 1D periodic chains
of finite size instantons, which serve as toy models of the full holographic
systems. In particular, for the finite-size case we determine solutions of the
corresponding ADHM equations for both a straight chain and for a 2D zigzag
configuration where instantons pop up into the holographic dimension. At low
density the system takes the form of an ""abelian anti-ferromagnetic"" straight
periodic chain. Above a critical density there is a second order phase
transition into a zigzag structure. An even higher density yields a rich phase
space characterized by the formation of multi-layer zigzag structures. The
finite size of the lattices in the transverse dimension is a signal of an
emerging Fermi sea of quarks. We thus propose that the popcorn transitions
indicate the onset of the ""quarkyonic"" phase of the cold dense nuclear matter.

  pages",,,,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This document describes a convention for compressing n-dimensional images and
storing the resulting byte stream in a variable-length column in a FITS binary
table. The FITS file structure outlined here is independent of the specific
data compression algorithm that is used. The implementation details for 4
widely used compression algorithms are described here, but any other
compression technique could also be supported by this convention. The general
principle used in this convention is to first divide the n-dimensional image
into a rectangular grid of subimages or 'tiles'. Each tile is then compressed
as a block of data, and the resulting compressed byte stream is stored in a row
of a variable length column in a FITS binary table. By dividing the image into
tiles it is generally possible to extract and uncompress subsections of the
image without having to uncompress the whole image.

the input table are copied to the header of the output table and remain
uncompressed for efficient access. The output compressed table contains the
same number and order of columns as in the input uncompressed binary table.
There is one row in the output table corresponding to each tile of rows in the
input table. In principle, each column of data can be compressed using a
different algorithm that is optimized for the type of data within that column,

used to compress every column.

growth at large supercooling is responsible for the apparent divergence of the

essential mechanical transition experienced by a liquid on cooling occurs at a
temperature well above the glass transition temperature and corresponds to the
crossover from the high temperature liquid to the viscous liquid, the latter
characterised by stress relaxation dominated by the residual stress. Following
on from this observation, as the density is decreased, the local potential
minima become unable to sustain any persistent stress (and, hence, support a
glass transition), in a manner that can be explicitly connected to the
interactions between atoms. The reported crossover implies an associated change
in the mechanism of dissipation in liquids and, hence, raises the prospect of a
coherent microscopic treatment of nonlinear rheology and the relationship
between self diffusion and viscosity in supercooled liquids.

Assuming that axisymmetric magnetic fields are located in a spherical crust

calculated up to Ohmic dissipation. The nonlinear coupling between poloidal and
toroidal components is explored in terms of their energies and helicity.
Nonlinear oscillation by the drift in strongly magnetized regimes is clear only
around the equipartition between two components. Significant energy is
transferred to the poloidal component when the toroidal component initially
dominates. However, the reverse is not true. Once the toroidal field is less
dominant, it quickly decouples due to a larger damping rate. The polar field at
the surface is highly distorted from the initial dipole during the Hall drift
timescale, but returns to the initial dipole in a longer dissipation timescale,
since it is the least damped one.

the width of the stream. The available data for four streams: the NW stream of
M31, the Pal~5 stream, the Orphan Stream and the Eastern Banded Structure, are

Carbon abundances derived from C I lines are about a factor of 4 lower than the
carbon abundance of the adopted model atmosphere over the same C/He interval,

abundances obtained from C2 Swan bands and that assumed for the model
atmosphere can be equated for a particular choice of C/He that varies from star
to star. Then, the carbon problem for C2 bands is eliminated. However, such
C/He ratios are in general less than those of the EHe stars, the seemingly
natural relatives to the RCB and HdC stars. A more likely solution to the C2
carbon problem may lie in a modification of the model atmosphere's temperature

numerous applications in communication networks such as token management, load
balancing, network topology discovery and construction, search, and
peer-to-peer membership management. While several such algorithms are
ubiquitous, and use numerous random walk samples, the walks themselves have
always been performed naively.
  In this paper, we focus on the problem of performing random walk sampling
efficiently in a distributed network. Given bandwidth constraints, the goal is
to minimize the number of rounds and messages required to obtain several random
walk samples in a continuous online fashion. We present the first round and
message optimal distributed algorithms that present a significant improvement
on all previous approaches. The theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experimental evaluation of our algorithms show that they perform very well in
different types of networks of differing topologies.
  In particular, our results show how several random walks can be performed
continuously (when source nodes are provided only at runtime, i.e., online),
such that each walk of length $\ell$ can be performed exactly in just
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\ell D})$ rounds, (where $D$ is the diameter of the network),
and $O(\ell)$ messages. This significantly improves upon both, the naive
technique that requires $O(\ell)$ rounds and $O(\ell)$ messages, and the
sophisticated algorithm of [DasSarma et al. PODC 2010] that has the same round
complexity as this paper but requires $\Omega(m\sqrt{\ell})$ messages (where
$m$ is the number of edges in the network). Our theoretical results are
corroborated through extensive experiments on various topological data sets.
Our algorithms are fully decentralized, lightweight, and easily implementable,
and can serve as building blocks in the design of topologically-aware networks.

can be used to estimate any nonlinear parameter associated with any study

functional approach and a linearization principle, the asymptotic variance of
the proposed estimators is derived, and variance estimators are shown to be
consistent under mild assumptions. The theory is fully detailed for penalized

guidelines for choosing the smoothing parameters. The validity of the method is
demonstrated on data extracted from the French Labor Force Survey. Point and
confidence intervals estimation for the Gini index and the low-income

interest in using a nonparametric approach versus a parametric one when

of the pairing symmetry in Fe-based materials. Phase-sensitive quasiparticle
interference (QPI) imaging and low temperature spectroscopy have shown that the
pairing order parameter varies from nodal to nodeless s\pm within a single
family, FeTe1-xSex. Second, STM has imaged C4 -> C2 symmetry breaking in the

probe, STM is in a strong position to understand the interactions between these
broken symmetry states and superconductivity. Finally, STM has been used to
image the vortex state, giving insights into the technical problem of vortex
pinning, and the fundamental problem of the competing states introduced when
superconductivity is locally quenched by a magnetic field. Here we give a

way that gives three dimensional affect when viewed. GSM have two short
messaging services, which can transfer images and sounds etc. Such services are
known as; MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) and EMS (Extended Messaging
Service). EMS can send Predefined sounds, animation and images but have
limitation that it does not support widely. MMS can send much higher contents
than EMS but need 3G and other network capability in order to send large size
data up to 1000 bytes. Other limitations are Portability, content adaption etc.
Our major aim in this paper is to provide an alternative way of sending stereo
images over SMS which is widely supported than EMS. We develop an application
using J2ME Platform.

addressed in this study. The maximum likelihood method often suffers
over-fitting when insufficient data is available. Although the Bayesian
approach can avoid over-fitting by using prior distributions, it still has
problems with objective analysis. In response to these drawbacks, a new
theoretical framework based on thermodynamics, where energy and temperature are
introduced, was developed. Entropy and likelihood are placed at the center of
this method. The key principle of inference for probability mass functions is
the minimum free energy, which is shown to unify the two principles of maximum
likelihood and maximum entropy. Our method can robustly estimate probability
functions from small size data.

interpretation as celestial bodies, either condensed independently or ejected
from parent stars in tight clusters, introduced an intriguing possibility.
Namely, that some exoplanets are not condensed from the protoplanetary disk of
their parent star. In this novel scenario a free-floating planet interacts with
an already existing planetary system, created in a tight cluster, and is
captured as a new planet. In the present work we study this interaction process
by integrating trajectories of planet-sized bodies, which encounter a binary
system consisting of a Jupiter-sized planet revolving around a Sun-like star.
To simplify the problem we assume coplanar orbits for the bound and the
free-floating planet and an initially parabolic orbit for the free-floating
planet. By calculating the uncertainty exponent, a quantity that measures the
dependence of the final state of the system on small changes of the initial
conditions, we show that the interaction process is a fractal classical
scattering. The uncertainty exponent is in the range (0.2-0.3) and is a
decreasing function of time. In this way we see that the statistical approach
we follow to tackle the problem is justified. The possible final outcomes of
this interaction are only four, namely flyby, planet exchange, capture or
disruption. We give the probability of each outcome as a function of the
incoming planet's mass. We find that the probability of exchange or capture (in
prograde as well as retrograde orbits and for very long times) is
non-negligible, a fact that might explain the possible future observations of
planetary systems with orbits that are either retrograde or tight and highly
eccentric.

governed by a discrete-time nonlinear Markov process. In open-loop, the
measurements are assumed to be quantum non-demolition (QND). The eigenstates of
the measured observable are thus the open-loop stationary states: they are used
to construct a closed-loop supermartingale playing the role of a strict control
Lyapunov function. The parameters of this supermartingale are calculated by
inverting a Metzler matrix that characterizes the impact of the control input
on the Kraus operators defining the Markov process. The resulting state
feedback scheme, taking into account a known constant delay, provides the
almost sure convergence of the controlled system to the target state. This
convergence is ensured even in the case where the filter equation results from
imperfect measurements corrupted by random errors with conditional
probabilities given as a left stochastic matrix. Closed-loop simulations
corroborated by experimental data illustrate the interest of such nonlinear
feedback scheme for the photon box, a cavity quantum electrodynamics system.

measure the masses and radii (to 1% or better!), and thus surface gravities and
mean densities, of stars in eclipsing binary systems using nothing more than
geometry. Adding an effective temperature subsequently yields luminosity and
then distance (or vice versa) to high precision. This wealth of directly
measurable quantities makes eclipsing binaries the primary source of empirical
information on the properties of stars, and therefore a cornerstone of stellar
astrophysics. In this review paper I summarise the current standing of
eclipsing binary research, present an overview of useful analysis techniques,
and conclude with a glance to the future.

distinct topological phases. This is in contrast to the simple termination of
the finite temperature critical line at the quantum critical point without any

the concept of simple spontaneous symmetry breaking assumed in the conventional

by mean-field critical exponents beta>1/2 and delta<3 is protected by the
existence of the quantum critical line. It emerges for several specific lattice

Sturm-Liouville problem with an effective singular oscillator. With boundary
conditions emerging from the problem, exact bound-state solutions in the spin-0
sector are found in closed form and it is shown that the spectrum exhibits
degeneracy. It is shown that, depending on the potential parameters, there may
or may not exist bound-state solutions in the spin-1 sector.

use the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and Very Large Array (VLA) maps of ammonia
(NH3) in six IRDCs to measure their column density and temperature structure

We find that IRDCs overall display organized velocity fields, with only
localized disruptions due to embedded star formation. The local effects seen in
NH3 emission are not high velocity outflows but rather moderate (few km/s)
increases in the line width that exhibit maxima near or coincident with the
mid-infrared emission tracing protostars. These line width enhancements could
be the result of infall or (hidden in NH3 emission) outflow. Not only is the
kinetic energy content insufficient to support the IRDCs against collapse, but
also the spatial energy distribution is inconsistent with a scenario of
turbulent cloud support. We conclude that the velocity signatures of the IRDCs
in our sample are due to active collapse and fragmentation, in some cases
augmented by local feedback from stars.

behavior of various micellar crystals of an athermal model of AB-diblock

representation of the chains which maps each copolymer on a soft dumbbell.
Thanks to this strong reduction of degrees of freedom, we are able to
investigate large aggregated systems, and for a specific length ratio of the
blocks f = MA/(MA + MB) = 0.6, to locate the order-disorder transition of the
system of micelles. Above the transition, mechanical and thermal properties are
found to depend on the number of particles per lattice site in the simulation
box, and the application of a recent methodology for multiple occupancy
crystals (B.M. Mladek et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 235702 (2007)) is necessary
to correctly define the equilibrium state. Within this scheme we have performed
free energy calculations at two reduced density {\rho}/{\rho}\ast = 4,5 and for
several cubic structures as FCC,BCC,A15. At both densities, the BCC symmetry is
found to correspond to the minimum of the unconstrained free energy, that is to
the stable symmetry among the few considered, while the A15 structure is almost
degenerate, indicating that the present sys- tem prefers to crystallize in less
packed structures. At {\rho}/{\rho}\ast = 4 close to melting, the Lindemann
ratio is fairly high (~ 0.29) and the concentration of vacancies is roughly 6%.
At {\rho}/{\rho}\ast = 5 the mechanical stability of the stable BCC structure
increases and the concentration of vacancies ac- cordingly decreases. The ratio
of the corona layer thickness to the core radius is found to be in good
agreement with experimental data for poly(styrene-b-isoprene)(22-12) in
isoprene selective solvent which is also reported to crystallize in the BCC

limited to producing samples of thickness above ~20 nm. Using atomistic
simulations alongside experiments, we show that this is due to effects from
finite ion beam sharpness at low milling energies combined with atomic-scale
effects at high energies which lead to shrinkage of the lamella. Specifically,
we show that attaining thickness below 26 nm using a milling energy of 30 keV
is fundamentally prevented by atomistic effects at the top edge of the lamella.
Our results also explain the success of a recently proposed alternative FIB
thinning method, which is free of the limitations of the conventional approach

It is difficult due to
its dependence on inverse kinematics (IK) techniques and articulate property of
human characters . To solve the IK problem, classical methods that rely on
numerical solutions often suffer from the under-determination problem and can
not guarantee naturalness. Existing data-driven methods address this problem by
learning from motion capture data. When facing a large variety of poses
however, these methods may not be able to capture the pose styles or be
applicable in real-time environment. Inspired from the low-rank motion
de-noising and completion model in \cite{lai2011motion}, we propose a novel
model for character posing based on sparse coding. Unlike conventional
approaches, our model directly captures the pose styles in Euclidean space to
provide intuitive training error measurements and facilitate pose synthesis. A
pose dictionary is learned in training stage and based on it natural poses are
synthesized to satisfy users' constraints . We compare our model with existing
models for tasks of pose de-noising and completion. Experiments show our model
obtains lower de-noising and completion error. We also provide User
Interface(UI) examples illustrating that our model is effective for interactive
character posing.

investigated, that is on an orbit almost straight into the Galactic central
supermassive black hole (SMBH). G2 is a sensitive probe of the hot accretion
zone of Sgr A*, requiring gas temperatures and densities that agree well with
models of captured shock-heated stellar winds. Its mass is equal to the
critical mass below which cold clumps would be destroyed quickly by
evaporation. Its mass is also constrained by the fact that at apocenter its
sound crossing timescale was equal to its orbital timescale. Our numerical
simulations show that the observed structure and evolution of G2 can be well
reproduced if it formed in pressure equilibrium with the surrounding in 1995 at
a distance from the SMBH of 7.6e16 cm. If the cloud would have formed at
apocenter in the 'clockwise' stellar disk as expected from its orbit, it would
be torn into a very elongated spaghetti-like filament by 2011 which is not
observed. This problem can be solved if G2 is the head of a larger, shell-like
structure that formed at apocenter. Our numerical simulations show that this
scenario explains not only G2's observed kinematical and geometrical properties
but also the Br_gamma observations of a low surface brightness gas tail that
trails the cloud. In 2013, while passing the SMBH G2 will break up into a
string of droplets that within the next 30 years mix with the surrounding hot

class of singular continuous measures that emerge in mathematical diffraction
theory and lead to somewhat similar distribution functions, yet with
significant differences. Various properties of these measures are derived. In
particular, these measures have supports of full Lebesgue measure and possess
strictly increasing distribution functions. In this sense, they mark the
opposite end of what is possible for singular continuous measures. For each
member of the family, the underlying dynamical system possesses a topological
factor with maximal pure point spectrum, and a close relation to a solenoid,
which is the Kronecker factor of the system. The inflation action on the
continuous hull is sufficiently explicit to permit the calculation of the
corresponding dynamical zeta functions. This is achieved as a corollary of
analysing the Anderson-Putnam complex for the determination of the
cohomological invariants of the corresponding tiling spaces.

Schr\""{o}dinger equation (DNLSE) with saturable onsite nonlinearity are
studied. A variational approximation (VA) for the solitary waves is derived in
an analytical form. The stability is also studied by means of the VA,
demonstrating that the solitons are stable, which is consistent with previously
published results. Then, the VA is applied to predict parameters of travelling
solitons with non-oscillatory tails (\textit{embedded solitons}, ESs).
Two-soliton bound states are considered too. The separation distance between
the solitons forming the bound state is derived by means of the VA. A numerical
scheme based on the discretization of the equation in the moving coordinate
frame is derived and implemented using the Newton--Raphson method. In general,
a good agreement between the analytical and numerical results is obtained. In

single network element. In a first step, we consider a single-server queueing
system with Poisson arrivals, exponential service times, and a single buffer
position. Packets arriving at a network node have a fixed deadline before which
they should reach the destination. To preserve server capacity, we introduce a
thresholding policy, based on remaining time until deadline expiration, to
decide whether to serve a packet or skip its service. The obtained goodput
improvement of the system is derived, as well as the operating conditions under
which thresholding can enhance performance. Subsequently, we focus our analysis
on a system that supports network coding instead of thresholding. We
characterize the impact of network coding at a router node on the delivery of
packets associated with deadlines. We model the router node as a queueing
system where packets arrive from two independent Poisson flows and undergo
opportunistic coding operations. We obtain an exact expression for the goodput
of the system and study the achievable gain. Finally, we provide an analytical
model that considers both network coding and packet skipping, capturing their
joint performance. A comparative analysis between the aforementioned approaches

transfer coefficients ({\alpha}a, {\alpha}c), and exchange current density to

A methodology to estimate the side-reaction rate and its role in the evolution
of the open-circuit potential of the LixSi system are discussed. We conclude
that the large potential offset between lithiation and delithiation reactions
at any given state of charge is partially caused by a large kinetic resistance
(i.e., small i0). Using the estimated parameters, the model is shown to predict
successfully the behavior of the system under galvanostatic lithiation and

well-cycled amorphous silicon thin-film electrodes at ambient temperature for
the following three commonly-used lithium-ion electrolyte formulations:
mixtures of ethylene carbonate and diethylene carbonate (EC:DEC) with and
without a fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) additive, and propylene carbonate

formulations, the electrolyte containing EC:DEC with the FEC additive exhibits
the lowest coulombic losses due to side-reactions, followed by PC, and EC:DEC
without the FEC additive (i.e., EC:DEC + FEC > PC > EC:DEC). The importance of
estimating side-reaction rates on a well-cycled electrode is discussed in the

uniformly coexists with superconductivity (SC) in underdoped regions, and that
the critical hole density pc for AFM is ~ 0.11 in the five-layered compound. We
present the layer-number dependence of AFM and SC phase diagrams in hole-doped
cuprates, where pc for n-layered compounds, pc(n), increases from pc(1) ~ 0.02
in LSCO or pc(2) ~ 0.05 in YBCO to pc(5) ~ 0.11. The variation of pc(n) is
attributed to interlayer magnetic coupling, which becomes stronger with
increasing n. In addition, we focus on the ground-state phase diagram of CuO2
planes, where AFM metallic states in slightly doped Mott insulators change into
the uniformly mixed phase of AFM and SC and into simple d-wave SC states. The
maximum Tc exists just outside the quantum critical hole density, at which AFM
moments on a CuO2 plane collapse at the ground state, indicating an intimate
relationship between AFM and SC. These characteristics of the ground state are
accounted for by the Mott physics based on the t-J model; the attractive
interaction of high-Tc SC, which raises Tc as high as 160 K, is an in-plane
superexchange interaction Jin (~ 0.12 eV), and the large Jin binds electrons of
opposite spins between neighboring sites. It is the Coulomb repulsive
interaction U ~ (> 6 eV) between Cu-3d electrons that plays a central role in
the physics behind high-Tc phenomena.

polarized electrical current entering a ferromagnet is transferred to the
magnetization. The effect has opened a new research field of electrically
driven magnetization dynamics in magnetic nanostructures and plays an important
role in the development of a new generation of memory devices and tunable
oscillators. Optical excitations of magnetic systems by laser pulses have been
a separate research field whose aim is to explore magnetization dynamics at
short time scales and enable ultrafast spintronic devices. We report the
experimental observation of the optical spin transfer torque, predicted
theoretically several years ago building the bridge between these two fields of
spintronics research. In a pump-and-probe optical experiment we measure
coherent spin precession in a (Ga,Mn)As ferromagnetic semiconductor excited by
circularly polarized laser pulses. During the pump pulse, the spin angular
momentum of photo-carriers generated by the absorbed light is transferred to
the collective magnetization of the ferromagnet. We interpret the observed
optical spin transfer torque and the magnetization precession it triggers on a
quantitative microscopic level. Bringing the spin transfer physics into optics
introduces a fundamentally distinct mechanism from the previously reported
thermal and non-thermal laser excitations of magnets. Bringing optics into the
field of spin transfer torques decreases by several orders of magnitude the
timescales at which these phenomena are explored and utilized.
