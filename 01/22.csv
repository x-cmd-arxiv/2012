studied using Langevin dynamics simulation, and the consequence of introducing
patterned stickiness inside the pore is investigated. It is found that the
translocation process is extremely sensitive to the detailed structure of such
patterns with faster than exponential dependence of translocation times on the
stickiness of the pore. The stochastic nature of the translocation process
leads to discernable differences between how polymers with different sequences
go through specifically patterned pores. This notion is utilized to propose a
stochastic sensing protocol for polynucleotides, and it is demonstrated that
the method, which would be significantly faster than the existing methods,
could be made arbitrarily robust.

quantified the underlying spatio-temporal phenomena. The equilibrium liquid
represents a hierarchical structure, a mosaic of long-living crystallites
partially separated by less-ordered regions. The long-time dynamics of this

principle without a counterpart in classical physics. This belief was
challenged after (i) finding that average dynamics of a classical particle in
strong inhomogeneous oscillating field resembles that of a quantum object and
(ii) experimental discovery of ""walkers"" - macroscopic droplets that bounce on
a vertically vibrating bath of the same fluid and can self-propell via
interaction with the surface waves they generate. This paper exposes a new
family of objects that can display both particle and wave features all together
while strictly obeying laws of the Newtonian mechanics. In contrast to the
previously known duality examples in classical physics, oscillating field or
constant inflow of energy are not required for their existence. These objects
behave deterministically provided that all their degrees of freedom are known
to an observer. If, however, some degrees of freedom are unknown, observer can
describe such objects only {\it probabilistically} and they manifest {\it
weird} features similar to that of quantum particles. We show new classical
counterparts of such quantum phenomena as particle interference, tunneling,
above-barrier reflection, trapping on top of a barrier, and spontaneous
emission of radiation. In the light of these findings, we hypothesize that
quantum mechanics may \emph{emerge} as approximation from a more profound
theory on a deeper level.

Both leading and trailing tails can be observed across at least 180 degrees of
the sky and measurements of their luminosity density profiles have recently
become available. Using numerical simulations, we explore the factors that
control the appearance of such profiles.
  We use two possible models for the Sgr progenitor. The first is a
one-component Plummer model, which may represent either a dark matter free
progenitor, or one in which pre-existing dark matter has already been largely
stripped. The second is a two-component model in which the stars are
represented by a Hernquist sphere embedded in a cosmologically modish
Navarro-Frenk-White dark halo. Disruption of the models in the Milky Way galaxy
provides us with two tellings of the tale of the formation of the Sgr stream.
The initial disintegration of the baryons proceeds more slowly for the
two-component models because of the protective cocoon of dark matter. Once this
has been stripped, though, matters proceed apace. In both cases, the profiles
after ~6 pericentric passages provide good matches to the observational data,
but the tails are more extended for the two-component models.
  The leading and trailing tails are symmetric at apocentre or pericentre. At
other orbital phases, asymmetries are present, as tails are compressed as they
approach apocentre and stretched out as they approach pericentre. There may
exist density enhancements corresponding to such pile-ups which may be
observable in current survey data. We re-visit the calculation of
Niederste-Ostholt et al. (2010) and slightly revise upwards the luminosity of
the Sgr progenitor to 9.9-14.4 x 10^7 solar luminosities based on insights from
the simulations.

phonons. This process effectively removes the spatial frequency cut-off for
unambiguous far field detection. This technique can be adapted for digital

subject has been of central importance. We show an example based on data
obtained with Hinode's Solar Optical Telescope. Observations show an active
region limb prominence, composed by a myriad of thin horizontal threads that
flow following a path parallel to the photosphere and display synchronous
vertical oscillations. The coexistence of waves and flows can be firmly
established. By making use of an interpretation based on transverse MHD kink
oscillations, a seismological analysis of this event is performed. It is shown
that the combination of high quality Hinode observations and proper theoretical
models allows flows and waves to become two useful characteristics for our

  deviations from spherical symmetry?","1 table, Astronomy & Astrophysics accepted for publication",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The evidence for the presence of optically thick winds, produced by classical
novae after optical maximum, has been challenged in recent papers. In addition,
signs of orbital phase dependent photometric variations, sometimes seen quite
early in the development of nova outbursts, are hard to interpret in the
framework of optically thick envelopes and especially winds. A general
discussion for belief in the presence of optically thick winds with increasing
ejection velocities during the early stages of novae after their explosion,
must be given. This has to be done in order to clarify ideas about novae as
well as to contribute in particular to the understanding of the behaviour of
novae V1500 Cyg and V1493 Aql showing phase dependent variations during very
early decline after the outburst. Possible ways of overcoming the apparent
contradiction of phase dependent variations through the production of
deviations from spherical symmetry of the winds, are looked at and order of
magnitude estimates are made for different theoretical scenarios, which might
produce such deviations. It is found that large deviations from spherical
symmetry of the optically thick winds in early phases after the explosion can
easily explain the problem of variations. In particular, the presence of a
magnetic field might have had a non-negligible effect on the wind of V1500 Cyg,
while at the present there is not enough information available concerning V1493
Aql. Optically thick winds/envelopes are almost certainly present in the early
stages after optical maximum of a nova, while it is difficult to make pure
Hubble flow models fit the observations of those stages. New more detailed
observational and theoretical work, in particular including the effects of
magnetic fields on the winds, is needed.

on the second fundamental form and uniformly bounded volume. We show
compactness in arbitrary dimension and codimension, generalizing a classical
result of J. Langer. In the second part, this result is used to deduce a
localized version, being more convenient for many applications, such as
convergence proofs for geometric flows.

  (2012)","10.1063/1.4739724",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","  Using four-terminal Landauer-B\""{u}ttiker formalism and Green's function
technique, in this present paper, we calculate numerically spin Hall
conductance (SHC) and longitudinal conductance of a finite size kagome lattice
with Rashba spin-orbit (SO) interaction both in presence and absence of
external magnetic flux in clean limit. In the absence of magnetic flux, we
observe that depending on the Fermi surface topology of the system SHC changes
its sign at different values of Fermi energy, along with the band center.
Unlike the infinite system (where SHC is a universal constant $\pm \frac{e}{8
\pi}$), here SHC depends on the external parameters like SO coupling strength,
Fermi energy, etc. We show that in the presence of any arbitrary magnetic flux,
periodicity of the system is lost and the features of SHC tends to get reduced
because of elastic scattering. But again at some typical values of flux
($\phi=1/2, 1/4, 3/4..., etc.) the system retains its periodicity depending on
its size and the features of spin Hall effect (SHE) reappears. Our predicted
results may be useful in providing a deeper insight into the experimental
realization of SHE in such geometries.

form connections through both random meetings and network-based search, but
with type-dependent biases. We show that there is ""long-run integration,""
whereby the composition of types in sufficiently old nodes' neighborhoods
approaches the global type distribution, provided that the network-based search
is unbiased. However, younger nodes' connections still reflect the biased
meetings process. We derive the type-based degree distributions and group-level
homophily patterns when there are two types and location-based biases. Finally,
we illustrate aspects of the model with an empirical application to data on
citations in physics journals.

model where choices are discrete but opinions are a continuous function (the
Continuous Opinions and Discrete Actions, CODA, model) and traditional discrete
models. I will show that, when CODA is altered to include reasoning about the
influence one agent can have on its own neighbors, agreement and disagreement
no longer have the same importance. The limit when an agent considers itself to
be more and more influential will be studied and we will see that one recovers
discrete dynamics, like those of the Voter model in that limit

bounded density in the set of primes. Studying the Cremona and Stein-Watkins
databases of elliptic curves we conjecture that the set of conductors should be
of density zero in the set of natural numbers and that the set of prime
