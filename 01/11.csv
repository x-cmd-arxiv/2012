embedded into a bulk waveguide with the cubic-quintic nonlinearity and uniform
linear losses, supports stable spatial solitons in the absence of the quintic
dissipation. The system, featuring the bistability between the solitons and
zero state (which are separated by a family of unstable solitons), may be used
as a nonlinear amplifier for optical and plasmonic solitons, which, on the
contrary to previously known settings, does not require gain saturation. The
results are obtained in an analytical form and corroborated by the numerical

Hz, its quality factor above 5 and its rms is between 4 and 10%. We found a
possible additional peak at 164 Hz when selecting a subset of data; however, at
4.5 sigma level we consider this detection marginal. These QPOs have hard
spectrum and are stronger in observations performed between September and
October 2011, during which IGR J17091-3624 displayed for the first time light

that the HFQPOs frequency in IGR J17091-3624 matches surprisingly well that
seen in GRS 1915+105 raises questions on the mass scaling of QPOs frequency in

orientation of an observer relative to the binary. Previous studies suggest
that emission along the total initial or total final angular momenta leads to
both the strongest and simplest signal from a precessing compact binary. In
this paper we describe a concrete counterexample: a binary with $m_1/m_2=4$,
$a_1=0.6 \hat{x} = -a_2$, placed in orbit in the x,y plane. We extract the
gravitational wave emission along several proposed emission directions,
including the initial (Newtonian) orbital angular momentum; the final (~
initial) total angular momentum; and the dominant principal axis of $<L_a
L_b>_M$. Using several diagnostics, we show that the suggested preferred
directions are not representative. For example, only for a handful of other
directions (< 15%) will the gravitational wave signal have comparable shape to
the one extracted along each of these fiducial directions, as measured by a
generalized overlap (>0.95). We conclude that the information available in just
one direction (or mode) does not adequately encode the complexity of
orientation-dependent emission for even short signals from merging black hole
binaries. Future investigations of precessing, unequal-mass binaries should
carefully explore and model their orientation-dependent emission.

HOMFLY homology groups of the link of a plane curve singularity in terms of the
weight polynomials of Hilbert schemes of points scheme-theoretically supported
on the singularity. The conjecture specializes to our previous conjecture
relating the HOMFLY polynomial to the Euler numbers of the same spaces upon
setting t = -1. By generalizing results of Piontkowski on the structure of
compactified Jacobians to the case of Hilbert schemes of points, we give an
explicit prediction of the HOMFLY homology of a (k, n) torus knot as a certain
sum over diagrams.
  The Hilbert scheme series corresponding to the summand of the HOMFLY homology
with minimal ""a"" grading can be recovered from the perverse filtration on the
cohomology of the compactified Jacobian. In the case of (k,n) torus knots, this
space furnishes the unique finite dimensional simple representation of the
rational spherical Cherednik algebra with central character k/n. Up to a
conjectural identification of the perverse filtration with a previously
introduced filtration, the work of Haiman and Gordon and Stafford gives
formulas for the Hilbert scheme series when k = mn + 1.

due to the shock break-out of GRB jets through a remnant stellar envelope. We
find consistency within a few percent of the nLC and the model template for
spindown of an initially extremal black hole against high-density matter at the
ISCO. The large BATSE size enables a study of the nLC as a function of
durations $T_{90}$. The resulting $\chi^2_{red}$ is within a $2.35\sigma$
confidence interval for durations $T_{90}>20$ s, which compares favorably with
the alternative of spindown against matter further out and spindown of a PNS,
whose $\chi^2$ fits are, respectively, outside the 4$\sigma$ and 12$\sigma$
confidence intervals. We attribute spindown against matter at the ISCO to
cooling by gravitational-wave emission from non-axisymmetric instabilities in
the inner disk or torus as the result of a Hopf bifurcation in response to
energetic input from the central black hole. This identification gives an
attractive outlook for chirps in quasi-periodic gravitational waves lasting

function of starred strong tableaux which correspond with labeled saturated
chains in the Bruhat order on the affine symmetric group modulo the symmetric

the affine Grassmannian of type A by Lam (2008), and, at t = 1, it is
equivalent to the k-tableaux characterization of Lapointe and Morse (2007). In
this paper, we extend Haiman's (1992) dual equivalence relation on standard
Young tableaux to all starred strong tableaux. The elementary equivalence
relations can be interpreted as labeled edges in a graph which share many of
the properties of Assaf's dual equivalence graphs. These graphs display much of
the complexity of working with k-Schur functions and the interval structure on

that acts to rotate the 2-spheres parametrized by \theta,\phi. In the boundary
conformal field theory (CFT), the way in which this symmetry manifests itself
hinges on the way we choose to embed Minkowski space in R{\times}S3. We present
results from an ongoing study of prompt black hole formation via scalar field
collapse, and explore the subsequent quasi-normal ringdown. Beginning with
initial data characterized by highly distorted apparent horizon geometries, the
metrics quickly evolve, via quasi-normal ringdown, to equilibrium static black
hole solutions at late times. The lowest angular number quasi-normal modes are
consistent with the linear modes previously found in perturbative studies,
whereas the higher angular modes are a combination of linear modes and of
harmonics arising from non-linear mode-coupling. We extract the stress energy
tensor of the dual CFT on the boundary, and find that despite being highly
inhomogeneous initially, it nevertheless evolves from the outset in a manner
that is consistent with a thermalized N=4 SYM fluid. As a first step towards
closer contact with relativistic heavy ion collision physics, we map this
solution to a Minkowski piece of the R{\times}S3 boundary, and obtain a
corresponding fluid flow in Minkowski space.

polarization observing capabilities have started operating during last years.
These facilities, as well as other previous millimeter telescopes and
interferometers, require bright and stable linear polarization calibrators to
calibrate new instruments and to monitor their instrumental polarization. The
current limited number of adequate calibrators implies difficulties in the
acquisition of these calibration observations. (Aims.) Looking for additional
linear polarization calibrators in the millimeter spectral range, in mid-2006
we started monitoring 3C 286, a standard and highly stable polarization
calibrator for radio observations. (Methods.) Here we present the 3 and 1 mm
monitoring observations obtained between September 2006 and January 2012 with
the XPOL polarimeter on the IRAM 30 m Millimeter Telescope. (Results.) Our
observations show that 3C 286 is a bright source of constant total flux with 3
mm flux density S_3mm = (0.91 \pm 0.02) Jy. The 3mm linear polarization degree
(p_3mm =[13.5\pm0.3]%) and polarization angle (chi_3mm
=[37.3\pm0.8]deg.,expressed in the equatorial coordinate system) are also
constant during the time span of our observations. Although with poorer time
sampling and signal-to-noise ratio, our 1 mm observations of 3C 286 are also
reproduced by a constant source of 1 mm flux density (S_1mm = [0.30 \pm 0.03]
Jy), polarization fraction (p_1mm = [14.4 \pm 1.8] %), and polarization angle
(chi_1mm = [33.1 \pm 5.7]deg.). (Conclusions.) This, together with the
previously known compact structure of 3C 286 -extended by ~3.5"" in the sky-
allow us to propose 3C 286 as a new calibrator for both single dish and
interferometric polarization observations at 3 mm, and possibly at shorter

have been as high as thousands of Gyr. Consequently, cloud collisions are
widely ignored as a source of viscosity in galactic disks. However, capturing
the hydrodynamics of discs in simple analytic models is a challenge, both
because of the wide dynamic range and importance of 2D and 3D effects. To test
the validity of analytic models we present estimates for the viscous time-scale
that are measured from three dimensional SPH simulations of disc formation and
evolution. We have deliberately removed uncertainties associated with
star-formation and feedback thereby enabling us to place lower bounds on the
time-scale for this process. We also contrast collapse simulations with results
from simulations of initially stable discs and examine the impact of numerical
parameters and assumptions on our work, to constrain possible systematics in
our estimates. We find that cloud-collision viscous time-scales are in the
range of 0.6-16 Gyr, considerably shorter than previously estimated. This large
discrepency can be understood in terms of how the efficiency of collisions is
included in the analytical estimates. We find that the viscous time-scale only
depends weakly on the number of clouds formed, and so while the viscous
time-scale will increase with increasing resolution, this effect is too weak to
alter our conclusions.

negative-electrode during electrolyte wetting and electrochemical cycling is
measured through wafer-curvature method. Upon electrolyte addition, the
composite electrode rapidly develops compressive stress of the order of 1-2 MPa
due to binder swelling; upon continued exposure, the stress continues to evolve
towards an apparent plateau. During electrochemical intercalation at a slow
rate, the compressive stress increases with the electrode's state-of-charge,
reaching a maximum value of 10 - 12 MPa. There appears to be an approximate
correlation between the rate of stress rise and the staging behavior of the
lithiated graphite. De-intercalation at a slow rate results in a similar linear
decrease in electrode stress. Tensile stress of a few MPa develops at the end
of deintercalation in the first few cycles, after which the electrode remains
under compressive stress only. Although higher peak stresses are seen at high
C-rates, the dependence appears to be relatively weak (up to 5C). These
measurements reveal, for the first time, the nature of stress evolution in
practical lithium-ion-battery electrodes and provide useful data to quantify
the driving force for mechanical damage that accrues in composite electrodes
upon repeated cycling. While the reported results can serve as reference for
calibrating theoretical and computational models to predict electrode stress
and damage evolution, the methodology demonstrated can be used to measure
stresses and characterize fatigue damage in any composite lithium-ion-battery
electrode as well as optimize its microstructure to mitigate stress-related

the gas distribution in galaxy clusters significantly rounder, even at radii as
large as half of the virial radius. However, such simulations generally predict
stellar fractions within cluster virial radii that are ~2 to 3 times larger
than the stellar masses deduced from observations. In this work we compare
ellipticity profiles of clusters simulated with and without baryonic cooling to
the cluster ellipticity profiles derived from Chandra and ROSAT observations in
an effort to constrain the fraction of gas that cools and condenses into the
central galaxies within clusters. We find that the observed ellipticity
profiles are fairly constant with radius, with an average ellipticity of 0.18
+/- 0.05. The observed ellipticity profiles are in good agreement with the
predictions of non-radiative simulations. On the other hand, the ellipticity
profiles of the clusters in simulations that include radiative cooling, star
formation, and supernova feedback (but no AGN feedback) deviate significantly
from the observed ellipticity profiles at all radii. The simulations with
cooling overpredict (underpredict) ellipticity in the inner (outer) regions of
galaxy clusters. By comparing the simulations with and without cooling, we show
that the cooling of gas via cooling flows in the central regions of simulated
clusters causes the gas distribution to be more oblate in the central regions,
but makes the outer gas distribution more spherical. We find that late-time gas
cooling and star formation are responsible for the significantly oblate gas
distributions in cluster cores, but the gas shapes outside of cluster cores are
set primarily by baryon dissipation at high redshift z > 2.

presence of an ionized absorber. Since this feature is not detected during the

that the ionized absorber is also variable; its location is estimated to be

question the common interpretation of velocity gradients as rotation, given the
possibility of projection effects in the observed velocities. Several
""idealized"" sources with well-ordered velocity fields and envelope structures
are now analyzed in more detail. We compare the interferometric data to
position-velocity diagrams of kinematic models for spherical rotating collapse
and filamentary rotating collapse. For this purpose, we developed a filamentary
parametrization of the rotating collapse model to explore the effects of
geometric projection on the observed velocity structures. We find that most
envelopes in our sample have PV structures that can be reproduced by an
infalling filamentary envelope projected at different angles within the plane
of the sky. The infalling filament produces velocity shifts across the envelope
that can mimic rotation, especially when viewed at single-dish resolutions and
the axisymmetric rotating collapse model does not uniquely describe any
dataset. Furthermore, if the velocities are assumed to reflect rotation, then
the inferred centrifugal radii are quite large in most cases, indicating
significant fragmentation potential or more likely another component to the
line-center velocity. We conclude that ordered velocity gradients cannot be
interpreted as rotation alone when envelopes are non-axisymmetric and that
projected infall velocities likely dominate the velocity field on scales larger

are split by strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling. The strong spin-orbit coupling
and two-dimensional nature of these surface states make them ideal platforms
for realizing topological superconductivity and Majorana fermions. In this
paper, we further develop a proposal to realize Majorana fermions at the ends
of quasi-one-dimensional metallic wires. We show how superconductivity can be
induced on the metallic surface states by a combination of proximity effect,
disorder, and interactions. Applying a magnetic field along the wire can drive
the wire into a topologically non-trivial state with Majorana end-states.
Unlike the case of a perpendicular field, where the chemical potential must be
fined tuned near the Rashba-band crossing, the parallel field allows one to
realize Majoranas for arbitrarily large chemical potential. We then show that,
despite the presence of a large carrier density from the bulk metal, it is
still possible to effectively control the chemical potential of the surface
states by gating. The simplest version of our proposal, which involves only an
Au(111) film deposited on a conventional superconductor, should be readily
realizable.

two-loop soft masses for gauge groups with arbitrary patterns of spontaneous

is communicated via a gauged subgroup of Standard Model flavor symmetries.
Flavor mediation can automatically generate suppressed masses for

gives rise to the Rashba spin-orbit-coupling in the barrier that enables
induced p-wave superconductivity in the ferromagnet to exist. We first develop
a microscopic theory of Andreev scattering at the spin-orbit-coupled interface,
derive a set of self-consistent boundary conditions, and find an expression for

Second, we study temperature-dependence of the resistance near the

suppression of the single-particle density of states due to the formation of
fluctuating pairs, whose tunneling is suppressed. In conclusion, we discuss
this and related setups involving ferromagnetic nanowires in the context of
one-dimensional topological superconductors. It is argued that to realize
unpaired end Majorana modes, one does not necessarily need a half-metallic

variations in plasma supply can affect both pulsar emission properties and
spin-down rates. A number of recently discovered ""intermittent"" pulsars switch
between two distinct states: an ""on"", radio-loud state, and an ""off"",
radio-quiet state. Spin-down rates in the two states differ by a large factor,
$\sim 1.5-2.5$, which is not easily understood in the context of current
models. In this Letter we present self-consistent numerical solutions of ""on""

as a nearly ideal force-free magnetosphere with abundant magnetospheric plasma
supply. The lack of radio emission in the ""off"" state is associated with plasma
supply disruption that results in lower plasma density on the open field lines.
We model the ""off"" state using nearly vacuum conditions on the open field lines
and nearly ideal force-free conditions on the closed field lines, where plasma
can remain trapped even in the absence of pair production. The toroidal
advection of plasma in the closed zone in the ""off"" state causes spin-downs
that are a factor of $\sim 2$ higher than vacuum values, and we naturally
obtain a range of spin-down ratios between the ""on"" and ""off"" states, $\sim

$30{-}90^\circ$. We consider the implications of our model to a number of

diminish rapidly, thereby hindering possible practical applications e.g. in the

distillable entanglement and Negativity as well as the notion of macroscopicity

compare the stability of C-GHZ states with other types of encodings, thereby
showing the superior stability of the C-GHZ states. Analytic results are
complemented by numerical studies, where tensor network techniques are used to
investigate the quantum properties of multipartite entangled states under the

near-infrared spectra, we find remarkable agreement between the two, implying
similar effective temperatures and metallicities. Both are metal-poor compared
to the Solar neighborhood, have low projected rotational velocity, high
absolute radial velocity, large proper motion and no quiescent H-alpha
emission--all of which is consistent with being old M dwarfs. We combine
empirical measurements of Barnard's Star and expectations from evolutionary
isochrones to estimate KOI 961's mass (0.13 +/- 0.05 Msun), radius (0.17 +/-
0.04 Rsun) and luminosity (2.40 x 10^(-3.0 +/- 0.3) Lsun). We calculate KOI
961's distance (38.7 +/- 6.3 pc) and space motions, which, like Barnard's Star,
are consistent with a high scale-height population in the Milky Way. We perform
an independent multi-transit fit to the public Kepler light curve and
significantly revise the transit parameters for the three planets. We calculate
the false-positive probability for each planet-candidate, and find a less than
1% chance that any one of the transiting signals is due to a background or
hierarchical eclipsing binary, validating the planetary nature of the transits.
The best-fitting radii for all three planets are less than 1 Rearth, with KOI
961.03 being Mars-sized (Rp = 0.57 +/- 0.18 Rearth), and they represent some of

remnant SNR 0509-67.5 (the site of a Type Ia supernova 400+-50 years ago, based
on its light echo) in the Large Magellanic Cloud contains no ex-companion star
to a limit of V=26.9 magnitude (M_V=+8.4) within the extreme 99.73% region with
radius 1.43"". The lack of any ex-companion star to deep limits rules out all
published single-degenerate models. The only remaining possibility is that the
progenitor for this particular SN Ia was a double-degenerate system.

the evolution of strategies decoupled instead of a coevolutionary dynamic. We
show conditions to build up a cooperative system with real topological
structures for any natural selection intensity. When the system starts to grow,
cooperation is unstable but becomes stable as soon as the system reaches a
small core of cooperators whose size increase when the intensity of natural
selection decreases. Thus, we reduce the emergence of cooperative systems with
cultural reproduction to justify a small initial cooperative structure that we
call cooperative seed. Otherwise, given that the system grows principally as
cooperator whose cooperators inhabit the most linked parts of the system, the
benefit-cost ratio required for cooperation evolve is drastically reduced
compared to the found in static networks. In this way, we show that in systems
whose individuals have imitation capacity the growing process is essential for
the evolution of cooperation.

several small to moderate length sequences from similar context arises in many
practical scenarios, such as the compression of the storage data and the
Internet traffic. In such scenarios, it is often required to compress and
decompress every sequence individually. However, the universal compression of
the individual sequences suffers from significant redundancy overhead. In this
paper, we aim at answering whether or not having a memory unit in the middle
can result in a fundamental gain in the universal compression. We present the
problem setup in the most basic scenario consisting of a server node $S$, a
relay node $R$ (i.e., the memory unit), and a client node $C$. We assume that
server $S$ wishes to send the sequence $x^n$ to the client $C$ who has never
had any prior communication with the server, and hence, is not capable of
memorization of the source context. However, $R$ has previously communicated
with $S$ to forward previous sequences from $S$ to the clients other than $C$,
and thus, $R$ has memorized a context $y^m$ shared with $S$. Note that if the
relay node was absent the source could possibly apply universal compression to
$x^n$ and transmit to $C$ whereas the presence of memorized context at $R$ can
possibly reduce the communication overhead in $S$-$R$ link. In this paper, we
investigate the fundamental gain of the context memorization in the
memory-assisted universal compression of the sequence $x^n$ over conventional
universal source coding by providing a lower bound on the gain of
memory-assisted source coding.

baryon asymmetry and thus enforces a tight relationship between the visible and
dark matter number densities. The purpose of this paper is to analyse the
general dynamics of this scenario in more detail and to construct specific
models. After reviewing the simple symmetry structure that underpins all
baryon-symmetric models, we turn to a detailed analysis of the required
Affleck-Dine dynamics. Both gravity-mediated and gauge-mediated supersymmetry
breaking are considered, with the messenger scale left arbitrary in the latter,
and the viable regions of parameter space are determined. In the gauge-mediated
case where gravitinos are light and stable, the regime where they constitute a
small fraction of the dark matter density is identified. We discuss the
formation of Q-balls, and delineate various regimes in the parameter space of
the Affleck-Dine potential with respect to their stability or lifetime and
their decay modes. We outline the regions in which Q-ball formation and decay
is consistent with successful pangenesis. Examples of viable dark sectors are
presented, and constraints are derived from big bang nucleosynthesis, large
scale structure formation and the Bullet cluster. Collider signatures and
implications for direct dark matter detection experiments are briefly
discussed. The following would constitute evidence for pangenesis:
supersymmetry, GeV-scale dark matter mass(es) and a Z' boson with a significant
invisible width into the dark sector.

single Gaussian fit. While a red-blue (RB) asymmetry analysis and a RB-guided
double Gaussian fit of the coronal line profiles indicate that these are likely
caused by the superposition of a strong background emission component and a
relatively weak (~10%) high-speed (~100 km s-1) upflow component. This finding
suggests that the outflow velocity in the dimming region is probably of the
order of 100 km s-1, not ~20 km s-1 as reported previously. Density and
temperature diagnostics suggest that dimming is primarily an effect of density
decrease rather than temperature change. The mass losses in dimming regions as
estimated from different methods are roughly consistent with each other and
they are 20%-60% of the masses of the associated CMEs. With the guide of RB
asymmetry analysis, we also find several temperature-dependent outflows (speed
increases with temperature) immediately outside the (deepest) dimming region.
In an erupted CME loop and an EUV jet, profiles of emission lines formed at
coronal and transition region temperatures are found to exhibit two
well-separated components, an almost stationary component accounting for the
background emission and a highly blueshifted (~200 km s-1) component
representing emission from the erupting material. The two components can easily
be decomposed through a double Gaussian fit and we can diagnose the electron
density, temperature and mass of the ejecta. Combining the speed of the
blueshifted component and the projected speed of the erupting material derived
from simultaneous imaging observations, we can calculate the real speed of the
ejecta.

information-theoretic privacy of communicated data based solely on the
assumption that the channel from sender to adversary is ""noisier"" than the
channel from sender to receiver. It has been the subject of decades of work in
the information and coding (I&C) community. This paper bridges the gap between
this body of work and modern cryptography with contributions along two fronts,
namely metrics (definitions) of security, and schemes. We explain that the
metric currently in use is weak and insufficient to guarantee security of
applications and propose two replacements. One, that we call mis-security, is a
mutual-information based metric in the I&C style. The other, semantic security,
adapts to this setting a cryptographic metric that, in the cryptography
community, has been vetted by decades of evaluation and endorsed as the target
for standards and implementations. We show that they are equivalent (any scheme
secure under one is secure under the other), thereby connecting two
fundamentally different ways of defining security and providing a strong,
unified and well-founded target for designs. Moving on to schemes, results from
the wiretap community are mostly non-constructive, proving the existence of
schemes without necessarily yielding ones that are explicit, let alone
efficient, and only meeting their weak notion of security. We apply
cryptographic methods based on extractors to produce explicit, polynomial-time

sets of matrices. This result is needed in our paper arXiv:1201.1672. The
result presented here has also applications in other situations and so it
should appear as part of a larger work.
  The statement of the lemma goes as follows: Suppose $X$ is a nonempty
algebraically closed subset of the affine space of $n \times m$ complex
matrices. Suppose that $X$ is column-invariant (i.e., belongingness to $X$
depends only on the column space of the matrix). Suppose $E$ is a vector
subspace of $\mathbb{C}^n$ that is not contained in the column space of any
matrix in $X$. Then $codim(X) \geq m + 1 - dim(E)$.
  The proof is simple and relies on intersection theory of the grassmannians

  Series",,"10.1088/0067-0049/199/1/9",,"astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We describe the implementation of a module for the Athena
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) code which solves the time-independent,
multi-frequency radiative transfer (RT) equation on multidimensional Cartesian
simulation domains, including scattering and non-LTE effects. The module is
based on well-known and well-tested algorithms developed for modeling stellar
atmospheres, including the method of short characteristics to solve the RT
equation, accelerated Lambda iteration to handle scattering and non-LTE
effects, and parallelization via domain decomposition. The module serves
several purposes: it can be used to generate spectra and images, to compute a
variable Eddington tensor (VET) for full radiation MHD simulations, and to
calculate the heating and cooling source terms in the MHD equations in flows
where radiation pressure is small compared with gas pressure. For the latter
case, the module is combined with the standard MHD integrators using
operator-splitting and we describe this approach in detail. Implementation of
the VET method for radiation pressure dominated flows is described in a
companion paper. We present results from a suite of test problems for both the
RT solver itself, and for dynamical problems that include radiative heating and
cooling. These tests demonstrate that the radiative transfer solution is
accurate, and confirm that the operator split method is stable, convergent, and
efficient for problems of interest. We demonstrate there is no need to adopt
ad-hoc assumptions of questionable accuracy to solve RT problems in concert
with MHD: the computational cost for our general-purpose module for simple
(e.g. LTE grey) problems can be comparable to or less than a single timestep of
Athena's MHD integrators, and only few times more expensive than that for more
general problems. (Abridged)

including convergence tests of radiation-modified linear acoustic and
magnetosonic waves, the structure of radiation modified shocks, and
two-dimensional tests of photon bubble instability and the ablation of dense
clouds by an intense radiation field. These tests cover a very wide range of
regimes, including both optically thick and thin flows, and ratios of the
radiation to gas pressure of at least 10^{-4} to 10^{4}. Across most of the
parameter space, we find the method is accurate. However, the tests also reveal
there are regimes where the method needs improvement, for example when both the
radiation pressure and absorption opacity are very large. We suggest
modifications to the algorithm that will improve accuracy in this case. We
discuss the advantages of this method over those based on flux-limited

supergravity, and some of its recent applications to inflation and reheating in
the early universe cosmology. The F(\cal R) supergravity is the N=1 locally
supersymmetric extension of the f(R) gravity in four space-time dimensions. A
manifestly supersymmetric formulation of the F(\cal R) supergravity exist in
terms of N=1 superfields, by using the (old) minimal Poincar'e supergravity in
curved superspace. We find the conditions for stability, the absence of ghosts
and tachyons. Three models of the F(\cal R) supergravity are studied. The first
example is devoted to a recovery of the standard (pure) N=1 supergravity with a
negative cosmological constant from the F(\cal R) supergravity. As the second
example, a generic {\cal R}^2-type supergravity is investigated, and the
existence of the AdS bound on the scalar curvature is found. As the third (and
most important) example, a simple viable realization of chaotic inflation in
supergravity is found. Our approach is {\it minimalistic} since it does not
introduce new exotic fields or new interactions, beyond those already present
in (super)gravity. The universal reheating mechanism is automatic. We establish
the consistency of our approach and also apply it to preheating and reheating
after inflation. The Higgs inflation and its correspondence to the Starobinsky
inflation is established in the context of supergravity. We briefly review
other relevant issues such as non-Gaussianity, CP-violation, origin of baryonic
asymmetry, lepto- and baryo-genesis. The F(\cal R) supergravity has promise for
possible solutions to those outstanding problems too.

the paper is on additively decomposable problems and the hierarchical Bayesian

crustal shear strength distribution by means of a phenomenological stick - slip
model. We obtain Weibull ITD for power-law stress accumulation, i.e.,
$\sigma(t) = \alpha t^{\beta}$, where $\beta >0$ for single faults or systems
with homogeneous strength statistics. We show that logarithmic stress
accumulation leads to the log-Weibull ITD. For the Weibull ITD, we prove that
(i) $m= \beta m_s$, where $m$ and $m_s$ are, respectively, the ITD and crustal
shear strength Weibull moduli and (ii) the time scale $\tau_s =
(S_s/\alpha)^{1/\beta}$ where $S_s$ is the scale of crustal shear strength. We
generalize the ITD model for fault systems. We investigate deviations of the
ITD tails from the Weibull due to sampling bias, magnitude selection, and
non-homogeneous strength parameters. Assuming the Gutenberg - Richter law and
independence of $m$ on the magnitude threshold, $M_{L,c},$ we deduce that
$\tau_s \propto e^{- \rho_{M} M_{L,c}},$ where $\rho_M \in [1.15, 3.45]$ for
seismically active regions. We demonstrate that a microearthquake sequence
conforms reasonably well to the Weibull model. The stochastic stick - slip
model justifies the Weibull ITD for single faults and homogeneous fault
systems, while it suggests mixtures of Weibull distributions for heterogeneous
fault systems. Non-universal deviations from Weibull statistics are possible,
even for single faults, due to magnitude thresholds and non-uniform parameter
values.

honeycombs and foams can be a difficult problem when the cell structure is
disordered. This paper suggests that tracking the flow of forces through the
material can help in visualizing and understanding how the geometry of the cell
structure affects the elastic behaviour. The mean strain tensor for a sample of
material can be calculated by summing over the force paths, weighted by the
strengths of the paths. This method emphasizes the paths with the greatest
stress, which can have the most dynamic effect. The path averaging technique
reproduces previous expressions for the Poisson's ratio of regular honeycombs,
but easily extends to disordered honeycombs and foams.

the component particles in this shell is similar to the capsomer proteins
forming the capsid of a T=1 virus. Growth occurs in the presence of an
atomistic solvent and, under suitable conditions, achieves a high yield of
complete shells. The simulations provide details of the structure and lifetime
of the particle clusters that appear as intermediate states along the growth
pathway, and the nature of the transitions between them. In certain respects
the growth of size-60 shells from trapezoidal particles resembles the growth of
icosahedral shells from triangular particles studied previously, with
reversible bonding playing a major role in avoiding incorrect assembly,
although the details differ due to particle shape and bond organization. The
strong preference for maximal bonding exhibited by the triangular particle
clusters is also apparent for trapezoidal particles, but this is now confined
to early growth, and is less pronounced as shells approach completion along a

Narrow bandwidths characterize the PL bandshape in non-polar solvents in
contrast to polar solvents, while in CCl4, a significant contribution is
observed from a blue-shifted species, possibly formed owing to a reaction
between the solvent and the molecule that breaks the {\pi}-conjugation.
Variation of the 0-0 band intensity in the PL spectrum as a function of solvent
suggests that longer H-aggregates have a larger contribution in the case of
polar solvents. Franck-Condon analysis suggests that the solvent dependence of
PL bandshape is owed to the presence of two emissive species in polar solvents.
We propose that the second emissive species observed in polar solvents could be
due to a stabilized charge-transfer state.

show how to derive a numerical representation for each forum, and we then use
this representation to derive a novel clustering of multiple forums.

bandwidth allocated to increase to exploit this capacity. But, if the same
relative capacity increase occurs at each network resource, it is also natural
to want each user to see the same relative benefit, so the bandwidth allocated
to each route should remain proportional. We will be interested in bandwidth
allocations which scale in this \textit{iso-elastic} manner and, also, maximize
a utility function.
  Utility optimizing bandwidth allocations have been frequently studied, and a
popular choice of utility function are the weighted $\alpha$-fair utility
functions introduced by Mo and Walrand \cite{MoWa00}. Because weighted
$\alpha$-fair utility functions possess this iso-elastic property, they are
frequently used to form fluid models of bandwidth sharing networks. In this
paper, we present results that show, in many settings, the only utility
functions which are iso-elastic are weighted $\alpha$-fair utility functions.
  Thus, if bandwidth is allocated according to a network utility function which
scales with relative network changes then that utility function must be a
weighted $\alpha$-fair utility function, and hence, a control protocol that is
robust to the future relative changes in network capacity and usage ought to
allocate bandwidth inorder to maximize a weighted $\alpha$-fair utility
function.

companion star. Planet formation in binary-star systems both depend on the
companion star parameters and on the properties of the circumstellar disc. An
eccentric disc may increase the impact velocity of planetesimals and therefore
jeopardize the accumulation process. We model the evolution of discs in close
binaries including the effects of self-gravity and adopting different
prescriptions to model the disc's radiative properties. We focus on the
dynamical properties and evolutionary tracks of the discs. We use the
hydrodynamical code FARGO and we include in the energy equation heating and
cooling effects. Radiative discs have a lower disc eccentricity compared to
locally isothermal discs with same temperature profile. As a consequence, we do
not observe the formation of an internal elliptical low density region as in
locally isothermal disc models. However, the disc eccentricity depends on the
disc mass through the opacities. Akin to locally isothermal disc models,
self-gravity forces the disc's longitude of pericenter to librate about a fixed
orientation with respect to the binary apsidal line ($\pi$). The disc's
radiative properties play an important role in the evolution of discs in
binaries. A radiative disc has an overall shape and internal structure that are
significantly different compared to a locally isothermal disc with same
temperature profile. This is an important finding both for describing the
evolutionary track of the disc during its progressive mass loss, and for planet
formation since the internal structure of the disc is relevant for
planetesimals growth in binary systems. The non-symmetrical distribution of
mass in these discs causes large eccentricities for planetesimals that may
affect their growth.

electron models and has been introduced to generalize the usual notion of the
Fermi surface to generic (superconducting or insulating) systems. By using
improved correlated wave functions that contain backflow and Jastrow terms, we
examine the two-dimensional $t{-}t^\prime$ Hubbard model and find a non-trivial
renormalization of the topology of the underlying Fermi surface close to the
Mott insulator. Moreover, we observe a sharp crossover region, which arises
from the metal-insulator transition, from a weakly interacting metal at small
coupling to a resonating valence-bond superconductor at intermediate coupling.
A violation of the Luttinger theorem is detected at low hole dopings.

properties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of the

infrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellar
radiation field. Consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies,
our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation,
including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to the
heating of the cold dust component. This work also shows that metallicity is
another key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal,

$\beta$=1.5 better fits the observed SPIRE flux density ratios $S250/S350$ vs.

mapping was already known since long, we recently emphasized the advantages on
such an approach to account for new variables in the BKT physics. One such
variable is the energy needed to create the core of the vortex, that is fixed
within the XY model, while it attains substantially different values in real
materials. This has interesting observable consequences, especially in the case
when additional relevant perturbations are present, as a coupling between
stacked two-dimensional superconducting layers or a finite magnetic field.

into account the observationally deduced uncertainty ranges of the orbital
parameters for the stellar components and the suggested planet. Furthermore,
our study employs additional mathematical methods, which include monitoring the
Jacobi constant, the zero velocity function, and the maximum Lyapunov exponent.
We again find that the suggested planet is indeed possible if assumed to be in
a retrograde orbit, but it is virtually impossible if assumed in a prograde
orbit. Its existence is found to be consistent with the deduced system
parameters of the binary components and of the suggested planet, including the
associated uncertainty bars given by observations.

semiclassical approximation as a preliminary approach to a quantum theoretical
implementation. The idea of a conformal--invariant extension of GR was
introduced by Weyl in 1919. For several decades it had little impact, as CGR
implies that all fields are massless. Today this does not appear to be an
unsurmountable difficulty since nonzero mass parameters may result from the
spontaneous breakdown of conformal symmetry. The theory leads to very
interesting results and predictions: 1) the spontaneous breakdown of conformal
symmetry is only possible in a 4D--spacetime with small negative curvature; 2)
CGR requires the introduction of a ghost scalar field $\sigma(x)$ invested with
geometric meaning and a physical scalar field $\varphi(x)$ of zero mass, both
of which have nonzero vacuum expectation values; 3) in order to preserve
$S$--matrix unitarity, $\sigma(x)$ and $\varphi(x)$ must interact in such a way
that the total energy density is bounded from below; 4) this interaction makes
$\varphi(x)$ behave like a Higgs field of varying mass, which is capable of
promoting a huge energy transfer from geometry to matter identifiable as the
big bang; 5) in the course of time, the Higgs boson mass becomes a constant and
CGR converges to GR.

transmission with arbitrarily correlated side informations at both receivers.
This scenario consists of an encoder (referred to as Alice) that wishes to
compress a source and send it through a noisy channel to a legitimate receiver
(referred to as Bob). In this context, Alice must simultaneously satisfy the
desired requirements on the distortion level at Bob, and the equivocation rate
at the eavesdropper (referred to as Eve). This setting can be seen as a
generalization of the problems of secure source coding with (uncoded) side
information at the decoders, and the wiretap channel. A general outer bound on
the rate-distortion-equivocation region, as well as an inner bound based on a
pure digital scheme, is derived for arbitrary channels and side informations.
In some special cases of interest, it is proved that this digital scheme is
optimal and that separation holds. However, it is also shown through a simple
counterexample with a binary source that a pure analog scheme can outperform
the digital one while being optimal. According to these observations and
assuming matched bandwidth, a novel hybrid digital/analog scheme that aims to
gather the advantages of both digital and analog ones is then presented. In the
quadratic Gaussian setup when side information is only present at the
eavesdropper, this strategy is proved to be optimal. Furthermore, it
outperforms both digital and analog schemes, and cannot be achieved via
time-sharing. By means of an appropriate coding, the presence of any
statistical difference among the side informations, the channel noises, and the
distortion at Bob can be fully exploited in terms of secrecy.

the rigid rotation of the solar core) can be explained by the action of the
Tayler instability of toroidal magnetic fields in the radiative zones of stars.
In order to place the theory of this instability on a safe fundament it has
been realized in a laboratory experiment measuring the critical field strength,
the growth rates as well as the shape of the supercritical modes. A strong
electrical current flows through a liquid-metal confined in a resting columnar
container with an insulating outer cylinder. As the very small magnetic Prandtl
number of the gallium-indium-tin alloy does not influence the critical Hartmann
number of the field amplitudes, the electric currents for marginal instability
can also be computed with direct numerical simulations. The results of this
theoretical concept are confirmed by the experiment. Also the predicted growth
rates of the order of minutes for the nonaxisymmetric perturbations are
certified by the measurements. That they do not directly depend on the size of
the experiment is shown as a consequence of the weakness of the applied fields
and the absence of rotation.

difficult question due to our poor understanding of nonaffinity. Here we
present a systematic analysis of this problem by allowing both network disorder

in lattices close to the limit of mechanical stability the elastic response

carbon-target-induced one-proton pickup reactions to the arsenal of
$\gamma$-ray tagged direct reactions applicable in the regime of low beam
intensities and to apply these for the first time to $fp$-shell nuclei.
Methods: Inclusive and partial cross sections were measured for the

$\nuc{12}{C}(\nuc{50}{Fe},\nuc{51}{Co}+\gamma)$X proton pickup reactions at

  eternal","9 pages",,,,"physics.gen-ph physics.hist-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many believe that the deep question of ""why is there something rather than
nothing?"" is unanswerable. The universe just is and no further explanation for
its existence is possible. In this paper I explain why this question must have
an answer, and why that answer must establish that physical existence is
inescapable and necessary. Based on the conclusion that if the universe is
eternal rather than having a beginning some finite time in the past, the
universe has to exist rather than not because its possible non-existence is
never an option, such an explanation is put forward. As a logical extension of
only an eternal universe being capable of providing an answer to the question
of why there is something rather than nothing, the argument necessitates that
the universe must be eternal. The consequences of this conclusion for cosmology
are then briefly discussed.
