are considered. Fundaments of fringe frequencies in the uv-plane are discussed
and filters are used to attenuate radio-frequency interference (RFI) and
off-axis sources. Several new applications of filters are introduced and
tested. A low-pass filter in time and frequency direction on single baseline
data is successfully used to lower the noise in the area of interest and to
remove sidelobes coming from unmodelled off-axis sources and RFI. Related side
effects of data integration, averaging and gridding are analysed, and shown to
be able to cause ghosts and an increase in noise, especially when using long
baselines or interferometric elements that have a large field of view. A novel
projected fringe low-pass filter is shown to be potentially useful for first
order source separation. Initial tests show that the filters can be several
factors faster compared to common source separation techniques such as peeling
and a variant of peeling that is currently being tested on LOFAR observations
called ""demixed peeling"". Further testing is required to support the
performance of the filters.

of settings, from vast offline databases to streaming real-time information.
Learning algorithms deployed in such contexts must rely on single-pass
inference, where the data history is never revisited. In streaming contexts,
learning must also be temporally adaptive to remain up-to-date against
unforeseen changes in the data generating mechanism. Although rapidly growing,
the online Bayesian inference literature remains challenged by massive data and
transient, evolving data streams. Non-parametric modelling techniques can prove
particularly ill-suited, as the complexity of the model is allowed to increase
with the sample size. In this work, we take steps to overcome these challenges
by porting standard streaming techniques, like data discarding and
downweighting, into a fully Bayesian framework via the use of informative
priors and active learning heuristics. We showcase our methods by augmenting a
modern non-parametric modelling framework, dynamic trees, and illustrate its
performance on a number of practical examples. The end product is a powerful
streaming regression and classification tool, whose performance compares
favourably to the state-of-the-art.

selection functions to study the empirical radial distribution of the galaxies
in a fully relativistic framework. The redshift range of the dataset used in
this work, which is up to five times larger than the one used in previous
studies, shows an increased relevance of the relativistic effects of expansion
when compared to the evolution of the LF at the higher redshifts. The results
also agree with the preliminary ones presented in Albani et al.

other molecular components of gene regulatory networks are modeled as discrete

interactions with other components. Stochasticity is modeled at the biological

circumstellar medium that produces most of the supernova luminosity. X-ray
emission from shock heated gas is crucial for the energetics of the interaction
and can provide diagnostics on the shock interaction. Provided that the shock
is at an optical depth tau_w\la c/v_s in the wind, where c is the speed of
light and v_s is the shock velocity, a viscous shock is expected that heats the
gas to a high temperature. For tau_w\ga 1, the shock wave is in the cooling
regime; inverse Compton cooling dominates bremsstrahlung at higher densities
and shock velocities. Although tau_w\ga 1, the optical depth through the
emission zone is \la 1 so that inverse Compton effects do not give rise to
significant X-ray emission. The electrons may not reach energy equipartition
with the protons at higher shock velocities. As X-rays move out through the
cool wind, the higher energy photons are lost to Compton degradation. If
bremsstrahlung dominates the cooling and Compton losses are small, the
energetic radiation can completely photoionize the preshock gas. However,
inverse Compton cooling in the hot region and Compton degradation in the wind
reduce the ionizing flux, so that complete photoionization is not obtained and
photoabsorption by the wind further reduces the escaping X-ray flux. We
conjecture that the combination of these effects led to the low observed X-ray
flux from the optically luminous SN 2006gy.

between an Au-coated sphere and an untreated or, alternatively, UV-treated
indium tin oxide film deposited on a quartz substrate. Measurements were
performed using an atomic force microscope in a high vacuum chamber. The
measurement system was calibrated electrostatically. Special analysis of the
systematic deviations is performed, and respective corrections in the
calibration parameters are introduced. The corrected parameters are free from
anomalies discussed in the literature. The experimental data for the Casimir
force from two measurement sets for both untreated and UV-treated samples are
presented. The experimental errors are determined at a 95% confidence level. It
is demonstrated that the UV treatment of an I TO plate results in a significant
decrease in the magnitude of the Casimir force (from 21% to 35% depending on
separation). However, ellipsometry measurements of the imaginary parts of
dielectric permittivities of the untreated and UV-treated samples did not
reveal any significant differences. The experimental data are compared with
computations in the framework of the Lifshitz theory. It is found that the data
for the untreated sample are in a very good agreement with theoretical results
taking into account the free charge carriers in an ITO film. For the UV-treated
sample the data exclude the theoretical results obtained with account of free
charge carriers. These data are in a very good agreement with computations
disregarding the contribution of free carriers. According to the explanation
provided, this is caused by the phase transition of the ITO film from metallic
to dielectric state caused by the UV treatment. Possible applications of the
discovered phenomenon in nanotechnology are discussed.

generalisation of reflected Brownian motion (RBM) in a polyhedral domain. This
process is obtained by replacing the singular drift on the boundary by a
continuous one which depends, via a potential U, on the position of the process
relative to the domain. It was shown by Harrison and Williams (1987) that RBM
in a polyhe- dral domain has an invariant measure in product form if a certain
skew-symmetry condition holds. We show that (modulo technical assumptions) the
generalised RBM has an invariant measure in product form if (and essentially
only if) the same skew-symmetry condition holds, independent of the choice of
potential. The invari- ant measure of course does depend on the potential.
Examples include TASEP-like particle systems, generalisations of Brownian
motion with rank-dependent drift and diffusions connected to the generalised
Pitman transform.

multiple harmonic oscillators in 3 dimensions. We use these results, along with

that the hot intracluster x-ray emitting gas is not spherically symmetric. In
many earlier studies spherical symmetry has been assumed partly because of
limited data quality, however new deep observations and instrumental designs
will make it possible to go beyond that assumption. Measuring the temperature
and density profiles are of interest when observing the x-ray gas, however the
spatial shape of the gas itself also carries very useful information. For
example, it is believed that the x-ray gas shape in the inner parts of galaxy
clusters is greatly affected by feedback mechanisms, cooling and rotation, and
measuring this shape can therefore indirectly provide information on these
mechanisms. In this paper we present a novel method to measure the
three-dimensional shape of the intracluster x-ray emitting gas. We can measure
the shape from the x-ray observations only, i.e. the method does not require
combination with independent measurements of e.g. the cluster mass or density
profile. This is possible when one uses the full spectral information contained
in the observed spectra. We demonstrate the method by measuring radial
dependent shapes along the line of sight for CHANDRA mock data. We find that at
least 10^6 photons are required to get a 5-{\sigma} detection of shape for an
x-ray gas having realistic features such as a cool core and a double powerlaw
for the density profile. We illustrate how Bayes' theorem is used to find the
best fitting model of the x-ray gas, an analysis that is very important in a
real observational scenario where the true spatial shape is unknown. Not
including a shape in the fit may propagate to a mass bias if the x-ray is used
to estimate the total cluster mass. We discuss this mass bias for a class of
spacial shapes.

realistic value of the decaying exponent $b$ in the Gutenberg-Richter law for
the avalanche size distribution. We explain why relaxation induces a systematic
increase of $b$ from its value $b\simeq 0.4$ observed in the absence of
relaxation. However, we have not been able to justify the actual robustness of

The
familiar chess pieces move about according to their usual chess rules, and each
player strives to place the opposing king into checkmate. The mate-in-n problem
of infinite chess is the problem of determining whether a designated player can
force a win from a given finite position in at most n moves. A naive
formulation of this problem leads to assertions of high arithmetic complexity
with 2n alternating quantifiers---there is a move for white, such that for
every black reply, there is a counter-move for white, and so on. In such a
formulation, the problem does not appear to be decidable; and one cannot expect
to search an infinitely branching game tree even to finite depth. Nevertheless,
the main theorem of this article, confirming a conjecture of the first author
and C. D. A. Evans, establishes that the mate-in-n problem of infinite chess is
computably decidable, uniformly in the position and in n. Furthermore, there is
a computable strategy for optimal play from such mate-in-n positions. The proof
proceeds by showing that the mate-in-n problem is expressible in what we call
the first-order structure of chess, which we prove (in the relevant fragment)
is an automatic structure, whose theory is therefore decidable. Indeed, it is
definable in Presburger arithmetic. Unfortunately, this resolution of the
mate-in-n problem does not appear to settle the decidability of the more
general winning-position problem, the problem of determining whether a
designated player has a winning strategy from a given position, since a
position may admit a winning strategy without any bound on the number of moves
required. This issue is connected with transfinite game values in infinite
chess, and the exact value of the omega one of chess is not known.

property that the trace of the field equations are of second order in the

curvature terms. Moreover the terms of a fixed order k in the curvature are
constructed by taking a complete contraction of k conformal tensors. The
general spherically (hyperbolic or plane) symmetric solution is then given by a
static asymptotically Lifshitz black hole with the dynamical exponent equal to
the spacetime dimensions. However, theories which are homogeneous in the
curvature (i.e., of fixed order k) possess additional symmetry which manifests
as an arbitrary conformal factor in the general solution. So, these theories
are analyzed separately and have been further divided into two classes
depending on the order and the spacetime dimensions.

receiver is based on compressive sampling techniques. Towards this end, we
develop a new low complexity algorithm termed Group Subspace Pursuit. Our

and was mapped onto an anisotropic two-channel Kondo model via bosonization.
For K<1, the strong coupling 2CK fixed point was argued to be stable for
infinitesimally weak tunnelings between dot and the 2DTI based on a simple
scaling dimensional analysis[21]. We re-examine this model beyond the bare
scaling dimension analysis via a 1-loop renormalization group (RG) approach
combined with bosonization and re-fermionization techniques near weak-coupling

point can be unstable towards the 1CK fixed point and the system may undergo a
quantum phase transition between 1CK and 2CK fixed points. The QPT in our model
comes as a result of the combined Kondo and the helical Luttinger physics in
2DTI, and it serves as the first example of the 1CK-2CK QPT that is accessible

can be written as a function of a single directly measurable operator, the
variance of the estimate from the sampling method equals to the quantum
mechanical one. In this sense, we say that the estimate is on the quantum
mechanical level of uncertainty. In contrast, if the observable depends on
non-commuting operators, e.g. different quadratures, the quantum mechanical
level of uncertainty is not achieved. The impact of the results on quantum
tomography is discussed, and different approaches to quantum tomographic

appealing. However, such an unification gives rise to leptoquark type gauge
bosons for which current collider limits push their masses well beyond the TeV
scale. We present a model in the framework of extra dimensions which breaks
such quark-lepton unification symmetry via compactification at the TeV scale.
These color triplet leptoquark gauge bosons, as well as the new quarks present
in the model, can be produced at the LHC with distinctive final state
signatures. These final state signals include high p_T multi-jets and
multi-leptons with missing energy, monojets with missing energy, as well as the
heavy charged particles passing through the detectors, which we also discuss
briefly. The model also has a neutral Standard Model singlet heavy lepton which
is stable, and can be a possible candidate for the dark matter.

Two fields, with depths of ~12 hr/pixel over 3 epochs, are analyzed at 3.6 and
4.5 mic. Maps of the fields were assembled using a self-calibration method
uniquely suitable for probing faint diffuse backgrounds. Resolved sources were
removed from the maps to a magnitude limit of AB mag ~ 25, as indicated by the
level of the remaining shot noise. The maps were then Fourier-transformed and
their power spectra were evaluated. Instrumental noise was estimated from the
time-differenced data, and subtracting this isolates the spatial fluctuations
of the actual sky. The power spectra of the source-subtracted fields remain
identical (within the observational uncertainties) for the three epochs
indicating that zodiacal light contributes negligibly to the fluctuations.
Comparing to 8 mic power spectra shows that Galactic cirrus cannot account for
the fluctuations. The signal appears isotropically distributed on the sky as
required for an extragalactic origin. The CIB fluctuations continue to diverge
to > 10 times those of known galaxy populations on angular scales out to < 1
deg. The low shot noise levels remaining in the diffuse maps indicate that the
large scale fluctuations arise from the spatial clustering of faint sources
well below the confusion noise. The spatial spectrum of these fluctuations is
in reasonable agreement with an origin in populations clustered according to
the standard cosmological model (LCDM) at epochs coinciding with the first
stars era.

Simultaneously, quantum measurement theory shows that the evolution of any open
system when its environment is measured is nonlinear and leads to pure states
conditioned on the measurement record. Here we report the discovery of a
fundamental relation between measurement and entanglement which is
characteristic of this scenario. It takes the form of a scaling law between the
amount of entanglement in the conditional state of the system and the
probabilities of the experimental outcomes obtained from measuring the state of
the environment. Using the scaling, we construct the distribution of
entanglement over the ensemble of experimental outcomes for standard models
with one open channel and provide rigorous results on finite-time
disentanglement in systems coupled to non-Markovian baths. The scaling allows
the direct experimental detection and quantification of entanglement in
conditional states of a large class of open systems by quantum tomography of
the bath.

situations begets the introduction of conditional strategies. Inspired by this,
we study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial public goods game, where
besides unconditional cooperators and defectors, also different types of
conditional cooperators compete for space. Conditional cooperators will
contribute to the public good only if other players within the group are likely
to cooperate as well, but will withhold their contribution otherwise. Depending
on the number of other cooperators that are required to elicit cooperation of a
conditional cooperator, the latter can be classified in as many types as there
are players within each group. We find that the most cautious cooperators, such
that require all other players within a group to be conditional cooperators,
are the undisputed victors of the evolutionary process, even at very low
synergy factors. We show that the remarkable promotion of cooperation is due
primarily to the spontaneous emergence of quarantining of defectors, which
become surrounded by conditional cooperators and are forced into isolated
convex ""bubbles"" from where they are unable to exploit the public good. This
phenomenon can be observed only in structured populations, thus adding to the
relevance of pattern formation for the successful evolution of cooperation.

The period of the overtone changes by up to 10 per cent compared to the linear
value, indicating a very significant nonlinear period shift caused by its
resonance with the fundamental mode. The observations also revealed weak peaks
that may correspond to the first or second overtones. These additional modes
are often coupled with period doubling. We investigated the possibilities and
occurrences of mutual resonances between the fundamental mode and multiple

low-ionization absorption is correlated with Ly$\alpha$ emission and the
high-ionization absorption is not. These trends are consistent with outflowing
neutral gas being in the form of neutral clouds embedded in ionized gas as

is shown that with increasing pore size, the theory predicts a transition of
the interplate pressure from an attractive to a strongly repulsive regime
associated with an ionic packing state, an effect observed in previous Monte
Carlo simulations for hard core charges. The role of the range of core
interactions in the ionic rejection and interplate pressure is thoroughly
analyzed. We show that the physics of the system can be split into two
screening regimes. The ionic packing effect takes place in the regime of
moderately screened core interactions characterized with the bare screening
parameter of the Yukawa potential b<3/lB, where lB is the Bjerrum length. In
the second regime of strongly screened core interactions b>3/lB, solvation
forces associated with these interactions positively contribute to the ionic
rejection driven by electrostatic forces and enhance the magnitude of the
attractive pressure. The pronounced dependence of the interplate pressure and
ionic partition coefficients on the magnitude and the range of core
interactions indicates excluded volume effects as an important ion specificity
and a non-negligible ingredient for the stability of macromolecules in
electrolyte solutions.

from collapsing clouds and protostellar discs and are necessary for the
formation of disc winds as well as jets from the inner disc and indeed, strong
large-scale poloidal magnetic fields are observed in protostellar discs at all
radii down to $\sim 10 R_\odot$. Nevertheless, by the time the star is visible
virtually all of the original magnetic flux has vanished. I explore mechanisms
for removing this flux during the formation of the protostar once it is
magnetically disconnected from the parent cloud, looking at both radiative and
convective protostars. This includes a numerical investigation of buoyant
magnetic field removal from convective stars. It is found that if the star goes
through a fully convective phase all remaining flux can easily be removed from
the protostar, essentially on an Alfv\'en timescale. If on the other hand the
protostar has no fully convective phase then some flux can be retained, the
quantity depending on the net magnetic helicity, which is probably quite small.
Only some fraction of this flux is visible at the stellar surface. I also look
at how the same mechanisms could prevent flux from accreting onto the star at
all, meaning that mass would only accrete as fast as it is able to slip past
the flux.

0.25) using a subset of cosmological, hydrodynamic simulations from the OWLS
project, focusing in particular on broad (b_HI > 40 km/s) HI Lyman-Alpha
absorbers (BLAs), which are believed to originate in shock-heated gas in the
warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). Our fiducial model, which includes
radiative cooling by heavy elements and feedback by supernovae and active
galactic nuclei, predicts that by z = 0.25 nearly 60 per cent of the gas mass
ends up at densities and temperatures characteristic of the WHIM and we find
that half of this fraction is due to outflows. The standard HI observables
(distribution of HI column densities N_HI, distribution of Doppler parameters
b_HI, b_HI - N_HI correlation) and the BLA line number density predicted by our
simulations are in remarkably good agreement with observations.
  BLAs arise in gas that is hotter, more highly ionised and more enriched than
the gas giving rise to typical Lyman-Alpha forest absorbers. The majority of
the BLAs arise in warm-hot (log (T/K) ~ 5) gas at low (log Delta < 1.5)
overdensities. On average, thermal broadening accounts for at least 60 per cent
of the BLA line width, which in turn can be used as a rough indicator of the
thermal state of the gas. Detectable BLAs account for only a small fraction of
the true baryon content of the WHIM at low redshift. In order to detect the
bulk of the mass in this gas phase, a sensitivity at least one order of
magnitude better than achieved by current ultraviolet spectrographs is
required. We argue that BLAs mostly trace gas that has been shock-heated and
enriched by outflows and that they therefore provide an important window on a
poorly understood feedback process.

may experience an increase in field strength during their early main-sequence,

reproduced by a composition of a low-temperature blackbody component, a
Comptonized component (COMPTB) and Gaussian component. We argue that the
electron temperature kT_e of the Compton cloud monotonically increases from 2.3
keV to 4.5 keV, when GX~3+1 makes a spectral transition. Using a disk seed
photon normalization of COMPTB, which is proportional to mass accretion rate,
we find that the photon power-law index Gamma is almost constant (Gamma=2.00+/-
0.02) when mass accretion rate changes by factor 4. We interpret this
quasi-stability of the index Gamma and a particular form of the spectrum in the
framework of a model in which the energy release in the transition layer
located between the accretion disk and neutron star surface dominates that in
the disk. Moreover, this index stability effect now established for GX~3+1 was
previously found in the atoll source 4U~1728-34 and suggested for a number of
other LMXB NS binaries (see Farinelli & Titarchuk). This intrinsic behavior of
neutron stars, in particular for atoll sources, is fundamentally different from
that seen in black hole binary sources where the index monotonically increases
during spectral transition from the low state to the high state and then
finally saturates at high values of mass accretion rate.

to intrinsic phase noise of the light sources, non-inertial motion of the light
sources, and atomic shot noise and compare them to sensitivity limits for
traditional light interferometers. We find that atom interferometers and light
interferometers are limited in a nearly identical way by intrinsic phase noise
and that both require similar mitigation strategies (e.g. multiple arm
instruments) to reach interesting sensitivities. The sensitivity limit from
motion of the light sources is slightly different and favors the atom
interferometers in the low-frequency limit, although the limit in both cases is
severe.

processes giving rise to the SEDs of a well-defined optically-selected sample

construct SEDs for six LINER~1s with simultaneous UV and X-ray fluxes, and we
looked for multiwavelength, radio to X-ray and UV to X-ray, correlations. At a
given X-ray luminosity, the average SED of the six LINER 1s in our sample: (1)
resembles the SED of radio-loud quasars in the radio band, <log R_X>~-2.7, (2)
exhibits a weak UV bump, <alpha_ox>~-1.17+-0.02 with a dispersion sigma=0.01,
and (3) displays a X-ray spectrum similar to radio-quiet quasars. The
bolometric luminosities inferred from the SEDs are extremely faint, at least
two orders of magnitude lower than AGN. The X-ray bolometric correction,
kappa_(2-10 keV), of our sample is lower than in the case of AGN, with a mean
value of 16. We find a strong anticorrelation between the radio loudness
parameter, R_X, and the Eddington ratio for our sample, confirming previous
results. Moreover, we find a positive correlation between the radio luminosity
and the X-ray luminosity which places AGN-powered LINERs, on a radio-power
scale, right between low luminosity Seyferts and low luminosity radio galaxies.
We complement our alpha_ox list with values derived on a well defined sample of
UV-variable LINERs, and establish a strong positive correlation between
alpha_ox (considering negative values) and the Eddington ratio, in contrast to
the correlation found for luminous AGN. Lastly, we tested two different
fundamental planes existing in the literature on our sample, in an attempt to
put constraints on the debated origin of the X-ray emission, ""RIAF versus jet"".
The results came contradictory with one pointing toward a RIAF-dominated X-ray
emission process and the other pointing toward a jet domination.

benefit from constraints on intrinsic scatter in mass-observable relationships.
In principle, two-parameter models combining direct measurements of galaxy
cluster structural variation with mass proxies such as X-ray luminosity and
temperature can be used to constrain scatter in the relationship between the
mass proxy and the cluster's halo mass and to measure the redshift evolution of
that scatter. One candidate for quantifying cluster substructure is the ICM
temperature inhomogeneity inferred from X-ray spectral properties, an example
of which is T_HBR, the ratio of hardband to broadband spectral-fit
temperatures. In this paper we test the effectiveness of T_HBR as an indicator
of scatter in the mass-temperature relation using 118 galaxy clusters simulated
with radiative cooling and feedback. We find that, while T_HBR is correlated
with clusters' departures \delta lnT_X from the mean M-T_X relation, the effect
is modest.

strong interest owing to the discovery of the topological insulator properties
in many members of this family of materials. The few-quintuple films of these
materials are particularly interesting from the physics point of view. We
report results of the micro-Raman spectroscopy study of the ""graphene-like""
exfoliated few-quintuple layers of Bi(2)Te(3), Bi(2)Se(3) and Sb(2)Te(3). It is
found that crystal symmetry breaking in few-quintuple films results in
appearance of A1u-symmetry Raman peaks, which are not active in the bulk
crystals. The scattering spectra measured under the 633-nm wavelength
excitation reveals a number of resonant features, which could be used for
analysis of the electronic and phonon processes in these materials. In order to
elucidate the influence of substrates on the few-quintuple-thick topological
insulators we examined the Raman spectra of these films placed on mica,
sapphire and hafnium-oxide substrates. The obtained results help to understand
the physical mechanisms of Raman scattering in the few-quintuple-thick films
and can be used for nanometrology of topological insulator films on various
substrates.

$ K, the resistivity at this minimum continues to drop at an accelerated rate
to much lower temperatures and becomes several times smaller than the
zero-field resistivity. Unexpectedly, we also find that the effect is destroyed
not only by increasing temperature but also by modest in-plane magnetic fields.
The analysis shows that giant negative magnetoresistance cannot be explained by
existing theories considering interaction-induced or disorder-induced

characterized by a black body of temperature 5000-13,000K, hotter than expected
for the quiescent outer disk. A good fit could not be found for MM Vel. The
source of the black-body-like emission is most likely a heated region of the
inner disk. Contrary to initial indications from spectroscopy there does not
appear to be a systematic difference in the UV luminosity or spectral shape
between black holes and neutron star systems. However combining our new data
with earlier spectroscopy and published X-ray luminosities there is a
significant difference in the X-ray to UV flux ratios with the neutron stars
exhibiting Lx/Luv about 10x higher than the black hole systems. Since both
bandpasses are expected to be dominated by accretion light this suggests the
difference in X-ray luminosities cannot simply reflect differences in quiescent
accretion rates and so is a more robust discriminator between the black hole

a common task which aids the discovery of heterogeneous biological
sub-populations having distinct mRNA profiles. Several model-based clustering
algorithms have been proposed in which the distribution of gene expression
values within each sub-group is assumed to be Gaussian. In the presence of
noise and extreme observations, a mixture of Gaussian densities may over-fit
and overestimate the true number of clusters. Moreover, commonly used
model-based clustering algorithms do not generally provide a mechanism to
quantify the relative contribution of each gene to the final partitioning of
the data. We propose a penalised mixture of Student's t distributions for
model-based clustering and gene ranking. Together with a bootstrap procedure,
the proposed approach provides a means for ranking genes according to their
contributions to the clustering process. Experimental results show that the
algorithm performs well comparably to traditional Gaussian mixtures in the
presence of outliers and longer tailed distributions. The algorithm also
identifies the true informative genes with high sensitivity, and achieves
improved model selection. An illustrative application to breast cancer data is
also presented which confirms established tumor subclasses.

demands, and the desire to model more complex and more massive star clusters,
hardware calculational accelerators, such as GRAPE special-purpose hardware or,
more recently, GPUs (i.e. graphics cards), are generally utilised. In addition,
simulations can be accelerated by adjusting parameters determining the
calculation accuracy (i.e. changing the internal simulation time step used for
each star).
  We extend our previous thorough comparison (Anders et al. 2009) of basic
quantities as derived from simulations performed either with STARLAB/KIRA or
NBODY6. Here we focus on differences arising from using different hardware
accelerations (including the increasingly popular graphic card
accelerations/GPUs) and different calculation accuracy settings.

  In general we find very high comparability of the simulation results,
independent of the used computer hardware (including the hardware accelerators)
and the used N-body code. For the tested accuracy settings we find that for
reduced accuracy (i.e. time step at least a factor 2.5 larger than the standard

standard settings. The remaining deviations are comprehensible and explicable.

extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs; stellar compact objects spiraling into a
spinning supermassive black hole) and their gravitational-wave emission. The
Chimera scheme is a hybrid method that combines tools from different
approximation techniques in General Relativity: (i) A multipolar,
post-Minkowskian expansion for the far-zone metric perturbation (the
gravitational waveforms) and for the local prescription of the self-force; (ii)
a post-Newtonian expansion for the computation of the multipole moments in
terms of the trajectories; and (iii) a BH perturbation theory expansion when
treating the trajectories as a sequence of self-adjusting Kerr geodesics. The
EMRI trajectory is made out of Kerr geodesic fragments joined via the method of
osculating elements as dictated by the multipolar post-Minkowskian
radiation-reaction prescription. We implemented the proper coordinate mapping
between Boyer-Lindquist coordinates, associated with the Kerr geodesics, and
harmonic coordinates, associated with the multipolar post-Minkowskian
decomposition. The Chimera scheme is thus a combination of approximations that
can be used to model generic inspirals of systems with extreme to intermediate

literature as an alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, to include
a non-zero cosmological constant. We retain the same volume partition of voids
and walls as the original FB model, and the same matching conditions for null
geodesics, but do not include effects associated with a nonuniform time flow
arising from differences of quasilocal gravitational energy that may arise in
the coarse-graining process. The Buchert equations are written and partially
integrated and the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions is given. For a
universe with $\Lambda=0$, as it is the case in the FB model, an initial void
fraction with hyperbolic curvature evolves in such a way that it asymptotically
fills completely our particle horizon. Conversely, in presence of a non
vanishing $\Lambda$, we show that this does not happen and the voids fill a
finite fraction $f_{v_{\infty}}<1$, where the value of $(1-f_{v_{\infty}})$ is
expected to depend on $\Lambda$ and the initial fraction $f_{vi}$ and also to
be small. For its determination, a numerical integration of the equations is
necessary. Finally, an interesting prediction of our model is a formula giving
a minimum allowed value of present day dark energy as a function of the age of
the universe and of the matter and curvature density parameters at our time.

(Note that systematic effects are not considered in this paper). For the
synchrotron and thermal dust Galactic emissions we use a coherent 3D model of
the Galaxy describing its mater density and the magnetic field direction and
intensity. We first simulate the synchrotron and dust emissions at 408 MHz and
545 GHz, respectively, and then we extrapolate them to the Planck frequency
bands. We perform a likelihood analysis to compare the simulated data to a set
of models obtained by varying the pitch angle of the regular magnetic field
spatial distribution, the relative amplitude of the turbulent magnetic field,
the radial scale of the electron and dust grain distributions, and the
extrapolation spectral indices for the synchrotron and thermal dust emissions.
We are able to set tight constraints on all the parameters considered. We have
also found that the observed spatial variations of the synchrotron and thermal
dust spectral indices should not affect our ability to recover the other
parameters of the model. From this, we conclude that the Planck satellite
experiment can precisely measure the main properties of the Galactic magnetic
field. An accurate reconstruction of the matter distribution would require on

The aim of this work was i.) to study the large scale environment over a large
redshift range, ii.) to study the evolution as well as any change in
environment with quasar luminosity and redshift, and iii.) to study the
orientation of a quasar with respect to a galaxy cluster.
  There is a deficit of quasars lying close to cluster centres for 0.4<z<0.8,
indicating a preference for less dense environments, in agreement with previous
work. These is no change with redshift (over 0<z<1.2) in the positions of the
quasars as a function of absolute quasar magnitude, nor preferred orientation
between the quasar and the cluster major axis for bright or faint quasars.
  Spectra of a selection of 680 star forming galaxies, red galaxies, and AGN
were taken, and used to study the environments of quasars with respect to
star-forming galaxies and galaxy clusters. The objects were classified (33
classed as AGN), and star formation rates calculated. Three AGN and 10 star
forming galaxies lie at the same redshift (z=0.29) as three galaxy clusters.
The three galaxy clusters have the same orientation angle and may be part of a
filament along with the star forming galaxies and AGN.
  A number of high redshift quasars showed evidence of ultra-strong UV FeII
emission in their spectra in the direction of three LQGs in the redshift range
1.1<z<1.6, including the Clowes-Campusano Large Quasar Group (CCLQG). Though

properly extended relativity. A possible extension is to include superluminal
transformations and reference frames. This leads to complex 4D spacetime, or
real 8D spacetime M_{4,4}. The mass shell constraint in M_{4,4} becomes, after
first quantization, the ultrahyperbolic Klein-Gordon equation. The Cauchy
problem for such equation is not well posed, because it is not possible to
freely specify initial data on a 7D hypersurface of M_{4,4}. We explicitly
demonstrate that it is possible to do it on a space-like 4-surface for
bradyons, and on a time-like 4-surface for tachyons. But then the evolution of
a bradyonic field into the four time-like directions, or the ""evolution"" of a
tachyonic field into the four space-like directions, is not uniquely
determined. We argue that this is perhaps no so bad, because in quantum field
theory (after second quantization) the classical trajectories of fields are not
determined anyway, and so it does not matter, if they are not completely
determined already in the first quantized theory. A next possible extension of
relativity is to consider 16D Clifford space, C, a space whose elements are
oriented r-volumes, r=0,1,2,3,4 of real 4D spacetime. Then the evolution
parameter can be associated with an extra light-cone coordinate, e.g., with the
sum of the scalar and the pseudoscalar coordinate, and initial data can be
given on a light-like hypersurface, in which case the Cauchy problem is well
posed. This procedure brings us to the Stueckelberg theory which contains
localized propagating tachyons in 4D spacetime.

defects of codimension two, e.g. point defects in two dimensions and filaments

mapping the quantum network to a kinetic network. This gives an analytic way to

network evolution shows that dephasing-assisted energy transfer is driven by
the two-site coherent interaction, and not system-wide coherence. Using the
Schur complement, we find a new kinetic network that gives a closer
approximation to the quantum network by including all multi-site coherence
contributions. Our new network approximation can be expanded as a series with
contributions representing different numbers of coherently interacting sites.
  For both kinetic networks we study the system relaxation time, the time it
takes for the excitation to spread throughout the complex. We make
mathematically rigorous estimates of the relaxation time when comparing kinetic

two kinetic network models, confirm our bounds, and show that the relative

response shows a strong dependence on the temperature and bias voltage and the
SiPM saturates due to the limited number of pixels, it needs to be monitored.
The monitoring system has to have sufficient flexibility to perform several
different tasks. The self-calibration property of the SiPMs can be used for the
gain monitoring using a low intensity of the LED light. A routine monitoring of
all SiPMs during test beam operations is achieved with a fixed-intensity light

the same spectral type from the literature. Our sample adds 157 new rotation
measurements to the existing literature and almost doubles the sample of

of rotation and activity at the transition to full convection in the solar

transition to full convection known from earlier work. In addition, we see a
clear rise in rotational velocity in the same stars. In very few stars, no
chromospheric activity but a detection of rotational broadening was reported.
We argue that all of them are probably spurious detections; we conclude that in
our sample all significantly rotating stars are active, and all active stars
are significantly rotating. The rotation-activity relation is valid in
partially and in fully convective stars. Thus, we do not observe any evidence
for a transition from a rotationally dominated dynamo in partially convective
stars to a rotation-independent turbulent dynamo in fully convective stars;
turbulent dynamos in fully convective stars of spectral types around M4 are
still driven by rotation. Finally, we compare projected rotational velocities

absorption, either to produce fluorescence or direct absorption signals. This
severely limits the range of molecules that can be detected, because most
molecules are purely refractive. Metal nanoparticles or dielectric resonators
detect non-absorbing molecules by a resonance shift in response to a local
perturbation of the refractive index, but neither has reached single-protein
sensitivity. The most sensitive plasmon sensors to date detect single molecules
only when the plasmon shift is amplified by a highly polarizable label or by a
localized precipitation reaction on the particle's surface. Without
amplification, the sensitivity only allows for the statistical detection of
single molecules. Here we demonstrate plasmonic detection of single molecules
in realtime, without the need for labeling or amplification. We monitor the
plasmon resonance of a single gold nanorod with a sensitive photothermal assay
and achieve a ~ 700-fold increase in sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art
plasmon sensors. We find that the sensitivity of the sensor is intrinsically
limited due to spectral diffusion of the SPR. We believe this is the first
optical technique that detects single molecules purely by their refractive
index, without any need for photon absorption by the molecule. The small size,
bio-compatibility and straightforward surface chemistry of gold nanorods may
open the way to the selective and local detection of purely refractive proteins
in live cells.

maps. It implies using a large galactic mask and dealing with a strong
inhomogeneous noise. For l < 100, we show that a full-sky inpainting method,
already described in a previous work, still allows a minimal variance
reconstruction, with a bias that must be accounted for by a Monte-Carlo method,
but that does not couple to the deflection field. For l>100 we develop a method
based on tiling the cut-sky with local 10x10 degrees overlapping tangent planes
(referred to in the following as ""patches""). It requires to solve various
issues concerning their size/position, non-periodic boundaries and irregularly
sampled data after the sphere-to-plane projection. We show how the leading
noise term of the quadratic lensing estimator applied onto an apodized patch
can still be taken directly from the data. To not loose spatial accuracy, we
developed a tool that allows the fast determination of the complex Fourier
series coefficients from a bi-dimensional irregularly sampled dataset, without
performing an interpolation. We show that the multi-patch approach allows the
lensing power spectrum reconstruction with a very small bias, thanks to
avoiding the galactic mask and lowering the noise inhomogeneities, while still
having almost a minimal variance. The data quality can be assessed at each
stage and simple bi-dimensional spectra build, which allows the control of
local systematic errors.

versions of Gilbert's tessellation. In the full rectangular version, lines
extend either horizontally (with east- and west-growing rays) or vertically
(north- and south-growing rays) from seed points which form a Poisson point
process, each ray stopping when another ray is met. In the half rectangular
version, east and south growing rays do not interact with west and north rays.
For the half rectangular tessellation we compute analytically, via recursion, a
series expansion for the ray-length distribution, whilst for the full
rectangular version we develop an accurate simulation technique, based in part
on the stopping-set theory of Zuyev, to accomplish the same. We demonstrate the
remarkable fact that plots of the two distributions appear to be identical when
the intensity of seeds in the half model is twice that in the full model. Our
paper explores this coincidence mindful of the fact that, for one model, our
results are from a simulation (with inherent sampling error). We go on to
develop further analytic theory for the half-Gilbert model using stopping-set
ideas once again, with some novel features. Using our theory, we obtain exact
expressions for the first and second moment of ray length in the half-Gilbert
model. For all practical purposes, these results can be applied to the
full-Gilbert model as much better approximations than those provided by
Mackissack and Miles.

ingredient in the structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks and in the
formation of larger bodies, such as planetesimals. Aims: We aim to derive
simple equations that explain the global evolution of the dust surface density
profile and the upper limit of the grain size distribution and which can
readily be used for further modeling or for interpreting of observational data.
Methods: We have developed a simple model that follows the upper end of the
dust size distribution and the evolution of the dust surface density profile.
This model is calibrated with state-of-the-art simulations of dust evolution,
which treat dust growth, fragmentation, and transport in viscously evolving gas
disks. Results: We find very good agreement between the full dust-evolution
code and the toy model presented in this paper. We derive analytical profiles
that describe the dust-to-gas ratios and the dust surface density profiles well
in protoplanetary disks, as well as the radial flux by solid material ""rain
out"", which is crucial for triggering any gravity assisted formation of
planetesimals. We show that fragmentation is the dominating effect in the inner
regions of the disk leading to a dust surface density exponent of -1.5, while
the outer regions at later times can become drift-dominated, yielding a dust
surface density exponent of -0.75. Our results show that radial drift is not
efficient in fragmenting dust grains. This supports the theory that small dust
grains are resupplied by fragmentation due to the turbulent state of the disk.

of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) in the vicinity of the Milky Way (MW)
whose origin remains a puzzle. Using a suite of collisionless N-body
simulations, we investigate the formation of UFDs in the context of the tidal
stirring model for the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the Local
Group (LG). Our simulations are designed to reproduce the tidal interactions
between MW-sized host galaxies and rotationally supported dwarfs embedded in
10^9 M_sun dark matter (DM) halos. We explore a variety of inner density slopes
\rho \propto r^{-\alpha} for the dwarf DM halos, ranging from core-like (\alpha
= 0.2) to cuspy (\alpha = 1), and different dwarf orbital configurations. Our
experiments demonstrate that UFDs can be produced via tidal stirring of disky
dwarfs on relatively tight orbits, consistent with a redshift of accretion by
the host galaxy of z \sim 1, and with intermediate values for the halo inner
density slopes (\rho \propto r^{-0.6}). The inferred slopes are in excellent
agreement with those resulting from both the modeling of the rotation curves of
dwarf galaxies and recent cosmological simulations of dwarf galaxy formation.
Comparing the properties of observed UFDs with those of their simulated
counterparts, we find remarkable similarities in terms of basic observational
parameters. We conclude that tidal stirring of rotationally supported dwarfs
represents a viable mechanism for the formation of UFDs in the LG environment.

consensus on what the connection is. In this contribution, we begin by noting
that the mechanisms which drive gas inwards in disk galaxies are generally
inefficient at removing angular momentum, leading to stalled inflows. Thus, a
tiered series of such processes is required to bring gas to the smallest
scales, each of which on its own may not correlate with the presence of an AGN.
Similarly, each may be associated with a starburst event, making it important
to discriminate between 'circumnuclear' and 'nuclear' star formation. In this
contribution, we show that stellar feedback on scales of tens of parsecs plays
a critical role in first hindering and then helping accretion. We argue that it
is only after the initial turbulent phases of a starburst that gas from slow
stellar winds can accrete efficiently to smaller scales. This would imply that
the properties of the obscuring torus are directly coupled to star formation
and that the torus must be a complex dynamical entity. We finish by remarking
on other contexts where similar processes appear to be at work.

conditional distribution of a response given a set of explanatory variables.
This goal is, however, seldom achieved because most established regression
models only estimate the conditional mean as a function of the explanatory
variables and assume that higher moments are not affected by the regressors.
The underlying reason for such a restriction is the assumption of additivity of
signal and noise. We propose to relax this common assumption in the framework
of transformation models. The novel class of semiparametric regression models
proposed herein allows transformation functions to depend on explanatory
variables. These transformation functions are estimated by regularised
optimisation of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts, e.g. the continuous
ranked probability score. The corresponding estimated conditional distribution
functions are consistent. Conditional transformation models are potentially
useful for describing possible heteroscedasticity, comparing spatially varying
distributions, identifying extreme events, deriving prediction intervals and
selecting variables beyond mean regression effects. An empirical investigation
based on a heteroscedastic varying coefficient simulation model demonstrates
that semiparametric estimation of conditional distribution functions can be
more beneficial than kernel-based non-parametric approaches or parametric
generalised additive models for location, scale and shape.

the surrounding large-scale filamentary structure, and (ii) to the tidal tensor
eigenvectors using the Horizon 4pi dark matter simulation which resolves over
43 million dark matter halos at redshift zero.
  We detect a clear mass transition: the spin of dark matter halos above a
critical mass tends to be perpendicular to the closest filament, and aligned
with the intermediate axis of the tidal tensor, whereas the spin of low-mass
halos is more likely to be aligned with the closest filament. Furthermore, this
critical mass of 5 10^12 is redshift-dependent and scales as (1+z)^-2.5. We
propose an interpretation of this signal in terms of large-scale cosmic flows.
In this picture, most low-mass halos are formed through the winding of flows
embedded in misaligned walls; hence they acquire a spin parallel to the axis of
the resulting filaments forming at the intersection of these walls. On the
other hand, more massive halos are typically the products of later mergers
along such filaments, and thus they acquire a spin perpendicular to this
direction when their orbital angular momentum is converted into spin. We show
that this scenario is consistent with both the measured excess probabilities of
alignment w.r.t. the eigen-directions of the tidal tensor, and halo merger
histories. On a more qualitative level, it also seems compatible with 3D
visualization of the structure of the cosmic web as traced by ""smoothed"" dark
matter simulations or gas tracer particles. Finally, it provides extra support

transmission, and scattering properties of periodic and random arrays of
particles which exhibit both electric-mode and magnetic-mode resonances. We
compare the properties of regular and random grids and explain recently
observed dramatic differences in resonance broadening in the electric and
magnetic modes of random arrays. We show that randomness in the particle
positioning influences equally on the scattering loss from both electric and
magnetic dipoles, however, the observed resonance broadening can be very
different depending on the absorption level in different modes as well as on
the average electrical distance between the particles. The theory is
illustrated by an example of a planar metasurface composed of cut-wire pairs.
We show that in this particular case at the magnetic resonance the array
response is almost not affected by positioning randomness due to lower
frequency and higher absorption losses in that mode. The developed model allows
predictions of behavior of random grids based on the knowledge of
polarizabilities of single inclusions.

investigated with no instantaneous channel state information (CSI) at
transmitters. First, it is assumed that the CSI is fed back to all nodes after
a finite delay (delayed CSIT), and furthermore, the transmitters operate in
full-duplex mode, i.e., they can transmit and receive simultaneously.
Achievable results are obtained on the degrees of freedom (DoF) of these
channels under the above assumption. It is observed that, in contrast with no
CSIT and full CSIT models, when CSIT is delayed, the achievable DoFs for both
channels with full-duplex transmitter cooperation are greater than the best
available achievable results on their DoF without transmitter cooperation. Our
results are the first to show that the full-duplex transmitter cooperation can
potentially improve the channel DoF with delayed CSIT. Then, $K$-user
interference and $K\times K$ X channels are considered with output feedback,
wherein the channel output of each receiver is causally fed back to its
corresponding transmitter. Our achievable results with output feedback
demonstrate strict DoF improvements over those with the full-duplex delayed
CSIT when $K>5$ in the $K$-user interference channel and $K>2$ in the $K\times
K$ X channel. Next, the combination of delayed CSIT and output feedback, known
as Shannon feedback, is studied and strictly higher DoFs compared to the output
feedback model are achieved in the $K$-user interference channel when K=5 or
$K>6$, and in the $K\times K$ X channel when $K>2$. Although being strictly
greater than 1 and increasing with size of the networks, the achievable DoFs in
all the models studied in this paper approach limiting values not greater than
2.

explanations of a paradoxical phenomenon of the quantum potential (QP). It
arises in quantum mechanics'(QM) of a particle in the Riemannian
$n$-dimensional configurational space obtained by various procedures of
quantization of the non-relativistic natural Hamilton systems. Now, the two
questions are investigated: 1)Does QP appear in the non-relativistic QM
generated by the quantum theory of scalar field (QFT) non-minimally coupled to
the space-time metric? 2)To which extent is it in accord with quantization of
the natural systems? To this end, the asymptotic non-relativistic equation for
the particle-interpretable wave functions and operators of canonical
observables are obtained from the primary QFT objects. It is shown that, in the
globally-static space-time, the Hamilton operators coincide at the origin of
the quasi-Euclidean space coordinates in the both altenative approaches for any
constant of non-minimality $\tilde\xi$, but a certain requirement of the
Principle of Equivalence to the quantum field propagator distinguishes the
unique value $\tilde\xi = 1/6$. Just the same value had the constant $\xi$ in
the quantum Hamiltonians arising from the traditional quantizations of the
natural systems: the DeWitt canonical, Pauli-DeWitt quasiclassical, geometrical
and Feynman ones, as well as in the revised Schr\""{o}dinger variational
quantization. Thus, QP generated by mechanics is tightly related to
non-minimality of the quantum scalar field. Meanwhile, an essential discrepancy
exists between the non-relativistic QMs derived from the two altenative
approaches: QFT generate a scalar QP, whereas various quantizations of natural
mechanics, lead to PQs depending on choice of space coordinates as physical
observables and non-vanishing even in the flat space if the coordinates are
curvilinear.

total with the Suzaku X-ray observatory from September 28 to October 30 in
2007, in the decaying phase of an outburst. In order to constrain the
flux-dependent accretion geometry of this source over wider energy bands than
employed in most of previous works, the present study utilized two out of the
seven data sets. The 0.8-31 keV spectrum on September 28, taken with the XIS
and HXD-PIN for an exposure of 13.8 ks, shows an absorbed 0.8-31 keV flux of
$3.6\times 10^{-9}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, together with typical
characteristics of the soft state of this type of objects. The spectrum was
successfully explained by an optically-thick disk emission plus a Comptonized
blackbody component. Although these results are in general agreement with
previous studies, the significance of a hard tail recently reported using the
same data was inconclusive in our analysis. The spectrum acquired on October 9
for an exposure of 19.7 ks was detected over a 0.8-100 keV band with the XIS,
HXD-PIN, and HXD-GSO, at an absorbed flux of $8.5\times 10^{-10}$ erg s$^{-1}$
cm$^{-2}$ (in 0.8-100 keV). It shows characteristics of the hard state, and was
successfully explained by the same two continuum components but with rather
different parameters including much stronger thermal Comptonization, of which
the seed photon source was identified with blackbody emission from the
neutron-star surface. As a result, the accretion flow in the hard state is
inferred to take a form of an optically-thick and geometrically-thin disk down
to a radius of $21\pm 4$ km from the neutron star, and then turn into an
optically-thin nearly-spherical hot flow.
