shock wave formations, how these solutions behave when they are
PT-symmetrically deformed. For real solutions we find that they are transformed
into peaked solutions with a discontinuity in the first derivative instead. The
systems we investigate include the PT-symmetrically deformed inviscid Burgers
equation recently studied by Bender and Feinberg, for which we show that it
does not develop any shocks, but peaks instead. In this case we exploit the
rare fact that the PT-deformation can be provided by an explicit map found by
Curtright and Fairlie together with the property that the undeformed equation
can be solved by the method of characteristics. We generalise the map and
observe this type of behaviour for all integer values of the deformation
parameter epsilon. The peaks are formed as a result of mapping the multi-valued
self-avoiding shock profile to a multi-valued self-crossing function by means
of the PT-deformation. For some deformation parameters we also investigate the
deformation of complex solutions and demonstrate that in this case the
deformation mechanism leads to discontinuties.

measuring their complexity in terms of Newton polytopes instead of total
degree. The sparse, or Newton, resultant generalizes the classical homogeneous
resultant and its degree is a function of the mixed volumes of the Newton
polytopes. We sketch the sparse resultant constructions of Canny and Emiris and
show how they reduce the problem of root-finding to an eigenproblem. A novel
method for achieving this reduction is presented which does not increase the
dimension of the problem. Together with an implementation of the sparse
resultant construction, it provides a general solver for polynomial systems. We
discuss the overall implementation and illustrate its use by applying it to
concrete problems from vision, robotics and structural biology. The high
efficiency and accuracy of the solutions suggest that sparse elimination may be
the method of choice for systems of moderate size.

variables through a confrontation with the time-resolved spectro-photometric
and interferometric PTI data set of TU And. We calibrated the interferometric
K-band time series to high precision. This results in 50 nights of
observations, covering 8 subsequent pulsation cycles. At each phase, the flux
at 2.2$\mu$m is obtained, along with the spectral shape and visibility points
in 5 channels across the K-band. We compared the data set to the relevant
dynamical, self-excited CODEX models. Both spectrum and visibilities are
consistently reproduced at visual minimum phases. Near maximum, our
observations show that the current models predict a photosphere that is too
compact and hot, and we find that the extended atmosphere lacks H2O opacity.
Since coverage in model parameter space is currently poor, more models are
needed to make firm conclusions on the cause of the discrepancies. We argue
that for TU And, the discrepancy could be lifted by adopting a lower value of
the mixing length parameter combined with an increase in the stellar mass
and/or a decrease in metallicity, but this requires the release of an extended

where species consume the common resource that is constantly supplied. We
assume that the species and resources are characterized by a continuous trait.
As already proved, this model, although more complicated than the usual
Lotka-Volterra direct competition model, describes competitive interactions
leading to concentrated distributions of species in continuous trait space.
Here we assume a very fast dynamics for the supply of the resource and a fast
dynamics for death and uptake rates. In this regime we show that factors that
are independent of the resource competition become as important as the
competition efficiency and that the direct competition model is a good
approximation of the chemostat. Assuming these two timescales allows us to
establish a mathematically rigorous proof showing that our resource-competition
model with continuous traits converges to a direct competition model. We also
show that the two timescales assumption is required to mathematically justify
the corresponding classic result on a model consisting of only finite number of
species and resources (MacArthur, R. Theor. Popul. Biol. 1970:1, 1-11). This is
performed through asymptotic analysis, introducing different scales for the
resource renewal rate and the uptake rate. The mathematical difficulty relies
in a possible initial layer for the resource dynamics. The chemostat model
comes with a global convex Lyapunov functional. We show that the particular
form of the competition kernel derived from the uptake kernel, satisfies a
positivity property which is known to be necessary for the direct competition
model to enjoy the related Lyapunov functional.

pheromone concentrations at all spatial positions in the experimental arena and
at different times. Then we derived the response function of individual ants to
pheromone concentrations by looking at correlations between concentrations and
changes in speed or direction of the ants. Ants were found to turn in response
to local pheromone concentrations, while their speed was largely unaffected by
these concentrations. Ants did not integrate pheromone concentrations over
time, with the concentration of pheromone in a 1 cm radius in front of the ant
determining the turning angle. The response to pheromone was found to follow a
Weber's Law, such that the difference between quantities of pheromone on the
two sides of the ant divided by their sum determines the magnitude of the
turning angle. This proportional response is in apparent contradiction with the
well-established non-linear choice function used in the literature to model the
results of binary bridge experiments in ant colonies (Deneubourg et al. 1990).
However, agent based simulations implementing the Weber's Law response function
led to the formation of trails and reproduced results reported in the
literature. We show analytically that a sigmoidal response, analogous to that
in the classical Deneubourg model for collective decision making, can be
derived from the individual Weber-type response to pheromone concentrations

processes) or nurture (interactions and effects of environment). Deconvolving
the two effects is an important current effort in astrophysics. Observed
properties of a sample of isolated galaxies should be largely the result of
internal (natural) evolution. It follows that nurture-induced galaxy evolution
can only be understood through comparative study of galaxies in different
environments. We take a first look at SDSS (g-r) colors of galaxies in the
AMIGA sample involving many of the most isolated galaxies in the local
Universe. This leads us to simultaneously consider the pitfalls of using
automated SDSS colors. We focus on median values for the principal
morphological subtypes found in the AMIGA sample (E/S0 and Sb-Sc) and compare
them with equivalent measures obtained for galaxies in denser environments. We
find a weak tendency for AMIGA spiral galaxies to be redder than objects in
close pairs. We find no clear difference when we compare with galaxies in other
(e.g. group) environments. However, the (g-r) color of isolated galaxies shows
a Gaussian distribution as might be expected assuming nurture-free evolution.
We find a smaller median absolute deviation in colors for isolated galaxies
compared to both wide and close pairs. The majority of the deviation on median
colors for spiral subtypes is caused by a color-luminosity correlation.
Surprisingly isolated and non-isolated early-type galaxies show similar (g-r).
We see little evidence for a green valley in our sample with most spirals
redder than (g-r)=0.7 having spurious colors. The redder colors of AMIGA
spirals and lower color dispersions for AMIGA subtypes -compared with close
pairs- is likely due to a more passive star formation in very isolated
galaxies.

a graph representing a set of measurements into subgraphs of suitable
independence numbers that themselves admit a joint probability distribution.
After establishing that all the subgraphs that are chordal graphs admit a joint
probability distribution, we formulate a precise graph-theoretic condition that
gives rise to the monogamy of contextuality. We also show how such monogamies
arise within quantum theory for a single four-dimensional system and interpret
violation of these relations in terms of a violation of causality. These
monogamies can be tested with current experimental techniques.

(DMC) with feedback. Unlike traditional fixed-rate codes, in rateless codes
each codeword is infinitely long, and the decoding time depends on the
confidence level of the decoder. Using rateless codes along with sequential
decoding, and allowing a fixed probability of error at the decoder, we obtain
results for several communication scenarios. The results shown here are
non-asymptotic, in the sense that the size of the message set is finite. First
we consider the transmission of equiprobable messages using rateless codes over
a DMC, where the decoder knows the channel law. We obtain an achievable rate
for a fixed error probability and a finite message set. We show that as the
message set size grows, the achievable rate approaches the optimum rate for
this setting. We then consider the universal case, in which the channel law is
unknown to the decoder. We introduce a novel decoder that uses a mixture
probability assignment instead of the unknown channel law, and obtain an
achievable rate for this case. Finally, we extend the scope for more advanced
settings. We use different flavors of the rateless coding scheme for joint
source-channel coding, coding with side-information and a combination of the
two with universal coding, which yields a communication scheme that does not
require any information on the source, the channel, or the amount the side
information at the receiver.

fundamental questions, such as the one formulated by Luce [4,5], which is still
unanswered: ""Why is information theory not very applicable to psychological
problems, despite apparent similarities of concepts?"" On this topic, Pinker
[6], one of the foremost defenders of the computational theory of mind [6], has
argued that thought is simply a type of computation, and that the gap between
human cognition and computational models may be illusory. In this context, in
his latest book, titled Thinking Fast and Slow [8], Kahneman [7,8] provides
further theoretical interpretation by differentiating the two assumed systems
of the cognitive functioning of the human mind. He calls them intuition (system
1) determined to be an associative (automatic, fast and perceptual) machine,
and reasoning (system 2) required to be voluntary and to operate logical-
deductively. In this paper, we propose an ansatz inspired by Ausubel's learning
theory for investigating, from the constructivist perspective [9-12],
information processing in the working memory of cognizers. Specifically, a
thought experiment is performed utilizing the mind of a dual-natured creature
known as Maxwell's demon: a tiny ""man-machine"" solely equipped with the
characteristics of system 1, which prevents it from reasoning. The calculation
presented here shows that [...]. This result indicates that when the system 2
is shut down, both an intelligent being, as well as a binary machine, incur the
same energy cost per unit of information processed, which mathematically proves
the computational attribute of the system 1, as Kahneman [7,8] theorized. This
finding links information theory to human psychological features and opens a
new path toward the conception of a multi-bit reasoning machine.

increasing time) smoothly (i) from being disconnected to being connected, or
(ii) from being simply connected to being multiply connected, where the
coordinate system is comoving and synchronous. We show that (i) and (ii) each
contain at least one exact solution. These subclasses exist because the
Einstein equations allow non-simultaneous big bang times. The two types of
topology evolution occur over time slices that include significantly
post-quantum epochs if the bang time varies by much more than a Planck time. In
this sense, it is possible for cosmic topology evolution to be ""mostly""

phase oscillators which, when isolated, have constant angular frequency.
Stochastic discrete versions of these uniform oscillators have also appeared in
the literature, with equal transition rates among the states. Here we start
from the model recently introduced by Wood et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 96}, 145701
(2006)], which has a collectively synchronized phase, and parametrically modify
the phase-coupled oscillators to render them (stochastically) nonuniform. We
show that, depending on the nonuniformity parameter $0\leq \alpha \leq 1$, a
mean field analysis predicts the occurrence of several phase transitions. In
particular, the phase with collective oscillations is stable for the complete
graph only for $\alpha \leq \alpha^\prime < 1$. At $\alpha=1$ the oscillators
become excitable elements and the system has an absorbing state. In the
excitable regime, no collective oscillations were found in the model.

condensed matter physics. When an electric current flows perpendicular to a
magnetic field, a Hall voltage develops in the direction transverse to both the
current and the field. In semiconductors, this behaviour is routinely used to
measure the density and charge of the current carriers (electrons in conduction
bands or holes in valence bands) -- internal properties of the system that are
not accessible from measurements of the conventional resistance. For strongly
interacting electron systems, whose behaviour can be very different from the
free electron gas, the Hall effect's sensitivity to internal properties makes
it a powerful tool; indeed, the quantum Hall effects are named after the tool
by which they are most distinctly measured instead of the physics from which
the phenomena originate. Here we report the first observation of a Hall effect
in an ultracold gas of neutral atoms, revealed by measuring a Bose-Einstein
condensate's transport properties perpendicular to a synthetic magnetic field.
Our observations in this vortex-free superfluid are in good agreement with
hydrodynamic predictions, demonstrating that the system's global
irrotationality influences this superfluid Hall signal.

SH(E)-module structure on the Hochschild (co)homology of W(E) which is
compatible with the string maps. The module and unital algebra structures, and
the generation criterion, also hold for the compact Fukaya category F(E), and
also hold for closed monotone symplectic manifolds. As an application, we show
that the wrapped category of any monotone negative line bundle over any
projective space is proper (cohomologically finite). For any monotone negative

algorithm can suffer from a slow convergence, particularly when it must
navigate a narrow canyon en route to a best fit. On the other hand, when the
least-squares function is very flat, the algorithm may easily become lost in
parameter space. We introduce several improvements to the Levenberg-Marquardt
algorithm in order to improve both its convergence speed and robustness to
initial parameter guesses. We update the usual step to include a geodesic
acceleration correction term, explore a systematic way of accepting uphill
steps that may increase the residual sum of squares due to Umrigar and
Nightingale, and employ the Broyden method to update the Jacobian matrix. We
test these changes by comparing their performance on a number of test problems
with standard implementations of the algorithm. We suggest that these two
particular challenges, slow convergence and robustness to initial guesses, are
complimentary problems. Schemes that improve convergence speed often make the
algorithm less robust to the initial guess, and vice versa. We provide an open
source implementation of our improvements that allow the user to adjust the
algorithm parameters to suit particular needs.

from the q->q G splitting in the projectile (proton) light-cone wave function
followed by a perturbative (C-odd) odderon interaction, together with a C-even
interaction, between the projectile and the target. We show that some aspects
of the obtained expression for the STSA of the produced quarks are in
qualitative agreement with experiment: STSA decreases with decreasing
projectile x_F and is a non-monotonic function of the transverse momentum k_T.
In our framework the STSA peaks at k_T near the saturation scale Q_s. Our
mechanism predicts that the quark STSA in proton-nucleus collisions should be
much smaller than in proton-proton collisions. We also observe that in our
formalism the STSA for prompt photons is zero.

models, which do not violate any astrophysical constraints due to a
non-power-law velocity dependence of the transfer cross section which is
motivated by a Yukawa-like new gauge boson interaction. Specifically, we focus
on the formation of a Milky Way-like dark matter halo taken from the Aquarius
project and re-simulate it for a couple of representative cases in the allowed
parameter space of this new model. We find that for these cases, the main halo
only develops a small core (~1 kpc) followed by a density profile identical to
that of the standard cold dark matter scenario outside of that radius. Neither
the subhalo mass function nor the radial number density of subhaloes are
altered in these models but there is a significant change in the inner density
structure of subhaloes resulting in the formation of a large density core. As a
consequence, the inner circular velocity profiles of the most massive subhaloes
differ significantly from the cold dark matter predictions and we demonstrate
that they are compatible with the observational data of the brightest Milky Way
dSphs in such a velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter scenario.
Specifically, and contrary to the cold dark matter case, there are no subhaloes
that are more concentrated than what is inferred from the kinematics of the
Milky Way dSphs. We conclude that these models offer an interesting alternative
to the cold dark matter model that can reduce the recently reported tension
between the brightest Milky Way satellites and the dense subhaloes found in
cold dark matter simulations.

of timing parameters and hence of exact transitions between different states
was hampered by the rather low count rate at which his outburst was observed.
We detected two periods of exponential decay, one after the source was
brightest, which was interrupted by several flares, and another one during the
high/soft state. The detection of these decays allowed us to obtain an estimate
for the source distance of at least 8.5 kpc. This leaves two possible
explanations for the observed low count rate; either the source has a distance
similar to that of other black hole X-ray binary candidates and it is
intrinsically faint, or it has a similar luminosity, but is located more than
12 kpc away from us. Furthermore, in the high/soft state the source spectrum
appears to be completely disc dominated.

et al. (2006) stellar samples. We find similar features in these two completely
independent stellar samples, consistent with the predictions of a Milky Way
minor-merger event. We next apply the same analyses to high-resolution,
idealised N-body simulations of the interaction between the Sagittarius dwarf
galaxy and the Milky Way. The energy distributions of stellar particle samples
in small spatial regions in the host disc reveal strong variations of structure
with position. We find good matches to the observations for models with a mass
of Sagittarius' dark matter halo progenitor $\lessapprox 10^{11}$ M$_{\odot}$.
Thus, we show that this kind of analysis could be used to provide
unprecedentedly tight constraints on Sagittarius' orbital parameters, as well
as place a lower limit on its mass.

equilibria of self-gravitating systems. One is the Lynden-Bell entropy
maximization analysis that introduced violent relaxation. Since we do not use
the Stirling approximation which is invalid at small occupation numbers, our
systems have finite mass, unlike Lynden-Bell's isothermal spheres. (Instead of
Stirling, we utilize a very accurate smooth approximation for $\ln{x!}$.) The
second analysis extends entropy production extremization to self-gravitating
systems, also without the use of the Stirling approximation. In addition to the
Lynden-Bell (LB) statistical family characterized by the exclusion principle in
phase-space, and designed to treat collisionless systems, we also apply the two
approaches to the Maxwell-Boltzmann (MB) families, which have no exclusion
principle and hence represent collisional systems. We implicitly assume that
all of the phase-space is equally accessible. We derive entropy production
expressions for both families, and give the extremum conditions for entropy
production. Surprisingly, our analysis indicates that extremizing entropy
production rate results in systems that have maximum entropy, in both LB and MB
statistics. In other words, both thermodynamic approaches lead to the same
equilibrium structures.

resonant absorption due to transitions between the two lowest subbands is

population of higher subbands. The Coulomb interaction between electrons causes
a shift of the resonant frequency, which depends on the population of the
excited states and thus on the electron temperature $T_e$. The latter is
determined experimentally from the electron photoconductivity. The
experimentally established relationship between the frequency shift and $T_e$
is in reasonable agreement with the theory. The dependence of the shift on the
radiation intensity introduces nonlinearity into the rate of the inter-subband

formation histories of elliptical galaxies by tracking correlations between the
stellar population parameters (age and metallicity) and the structural
parameters that enter the fundamental plane (size and velocity dispersion).
These studies have found that velocity dispersion, rather than effective radius
or dynamical mass, is the main predictor of a galaxy's stellar age and
metallicity. In this work, we apply an analytic model that predicts the
structural properties of remnants formed in major mergers to progenitor disk
galaxies with properties taken from two different semi-analytic models. We
predict the effective radius, velocity dispersion, luminosity, age, and
metallicity of the merger remnants, enabling us to compare directly to
observations of early-type galaxies. While we find a tight correlation between
age and velocity dispersion, we find a stronger dependence of age and
metallicity on effective radius than observations report. The correlations
arise as a result of the dependence of gas fraction, age, and metallicity on
the stellar mass in the progenitor disk galaxies. These dependences induce a
rotation in the radius-velocity plane between the correlations with effective
radius and circular velocity in the disk galaxy progenitors, and the
correlations with effective radius and velocity dispersion in the elliptical
galaxy remnants. The differences between our results and those from
observations suggest that major mergers alone cannot produce the observed lack
of correlation between effective radius and stellar population parameters.
Simulations have suggested that subsequent minor mergers introduce scatter in
the effective radius while leaving the velocity dispersion essentially
unchanged. Incorporating such minor mergers into the model may, then, bring the
simulations into closer agreement with observations.

discovered in under-doped cuprates by inelastic neutron scattering.
Polarization analysis reveals that the modes are magnetic excitations. They are
only visible for temperatures below the transition temperature to a broken
symmetry phase which was discovered earlier and their intensity increases as
temperature is further decreased. The broken symmetry phase itself has
symmetries consistent with ordering of orbital current loops within a unit-cell
without breaking translational symmetry. In order to calculate the collective
modes of such a state we add quantum terms to the Ashkin-Teller (AT) model with
which the classical loop current order has been described. We derive that the
mean field ground state of the quantum model is a product over all unit-cells
of linear combination of the four possible classical configurations of the loop
current order in each unit-cell. The collective modes are calculated by using a
generalized Holstein-Primakoff boson representation of orbital moment operators
and lead to three branches of gapped weakly dispersive collective modes. The
experimental results are consistent with the two lower energy branches; the
third mode is at a higher energy than looked for by present neutron scattering
experiments and might also be over-damped. Implications of the discovery of the
collective modes are discussed.

set constraints on models of the early universe, such as inflation. Using a
MCMC analysis, we compare the power of the CMB with that of the combination of
CMB and galaxy survey data, to constrain the power spectrum of primordial
fluctuations generated during inflation. We base our analysis on the Planck
satellite and a spectroscopic redshift survey with configuration parameters

slow-roll inflation, and show that the inclusion of large scale structure data
improves the constraints by nearly halving the error bars on the scalar
spectral index and its running. If we attempt to reconstruct the inflationary
single-field potential, a similar conclusion can be reached on the parameters
characterizing the potential. We then study models with features in the power
spectrum. In particular, we consider ringing features produced by a break in
the potential and oscillations such as in axion monodromy. Adding large scale
structures improves the constraints on features by more than a factor of two.
In axion monodromy we show that there are oscillations with small amplitude and
frequency in momentum space that are undetected by CMB alone but can be
measured by including galaxy surveys in the analysis.

all triangles and the torus lattice is the standard triangular lattice, is at
most $\frac{n}{n+1}\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{12}}$, where $n$ is the number of packing
disks. Several classes of collectively jammed packings are presented where the
conjecture holds.

analogs, yielding a glimpse into the future of our own Sun. The orbital period
of the binary system is too long to provide meaningful dynamical constraints on
the stellar properties, but asteroseismology can help because the stars are
among the brightest in the Kepler field. We present an analysis of three months
of nearly uninterrupted photometry of 16 Cyg A & B from the Kepler space
telescope. We extract a total of 46 and 41 oscillation frequencies for the two
components respectively, including a clear detection of octupole (l=3) modes in
both stars. We derive the properties of each star independently using the
Asteroseismic Modeling Portal, fitting the individual oscillation frequencies
and other observational constraints simultaneously. We evaluate the systematic
uncertainties from an ensemble of results generated by a variety of stellar
evolution codes and fitting methods. The optimal models derived by fitting each
component individually yield a common age (t=6.8+/-0.4 Gyr) and initial
composition (Z_i=0.024+/-0.002, Y_i=0.25+/-0.01) within the uncertainties, as
expected for the components of a binary system, bolstering our confidence in
the reliability of asteroseismic techniques. The longer data sets that will
ultimately become available will allow future studies of differential rotation,
convection zone depths, and long-term changes due to stellar activity cycles.

Poisson noise. As in the Non-Local Means filter, the proposed algorithm is
based on a weighted linear combination of the bserved image. But in contract to
the latter where the weights are defined by a Gaussian kernel, we propose to
choose them in an optimal way. First some ""oracle"" weights are defined by
minimizing a very tight upper bound of the Mean Square Error. For a practical
application the weights are estimated from the observed image. We prove that
the proposed filter converges at the usual optimal rate to the true image.
Simulation results are presented to compare the performance of the presented
filter with conventional filtering methods.

geometric discord of arbitrary bipartite states. In a single shot this also
leads to an upper bound of measurement-induced non locality which in turn
yields that for Werner and isotropic states the two measures coincide. We also
emphasize that our lower bound is saturated for all $2\otimes n$ states. Using
this we show that both the generalized Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and $W$
states of $N$ qubits satisfy monogamy of geometric discord. Indeed, the same
holds for all $N$-qubit pure states which are equivalent to $W$ states under
stochastic local operations and classical communication. We show by giving an
example that not all pure states of four or higher qubits satisfy monogamy.

We show that the substrate has strong interaction with single-layer GNRs during
the thermal transport, which largely reduces the thermal conductivity. The
thermal conductivity characteristics of suspended GNRs are well preserved in
the second GNR layers of bilayer GNR, which has a weak van der Waals
interaction with the underlying structures. The out-of-plane phonon mode is
found to play a critical role on the thermal conductivity variation of the
second GNR layer induced by the underlying structures.

\varepsilon_k=\sqrt{k^2-m^2} and clarify that tachyons with imaginary energy
and low momentum (k<m) play the role of Dirac sea in a many-tachyon Fermi
system and make contribution to the thermodynamical functions. The energy and
pressure acquire additional constant terms that, however, is not reflected in
the sound speed. Replacement $m=im$ results in the thermodynamical functions
and the sound speed of an ordinary Fermi gas. When the Fermi momentum
approaches the Dirac sea level k_F=m, the group velocity of most tachyons above
the sea is unbound, while the sound speed tends to infinity. This scenario is
not encountered in practice because the cold tachyon Fermi gas becomes unstable
with respect to hydrodynamical perturbations when k_F<\sqrt{3/2}m. The particle
number density of a stable many-tachyon system is always finite and exceeds the
critical value depending on the tachyon mass m.
