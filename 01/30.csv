theorem. Alternatively, instead of fitting for the moments, observations can be
matched to frequencies calculated from analytic models that are produced so as
to correspond to realistic neutron stars described by various equations of
state. Observations can thus be used to constrain the equation of state and
possibly other physical parameters (mass, rotation, quadrupole, etc.) Some
distinctive features of the frequencies, which become evident by using the
analytic models, are discussed.

supported in a boundary collar are considered. Hadamard well-posedness for von
Karman plates with various types of nonlinear damping are well-known, and the
long-time behavior of nonlinear plates has been a topic of recent interest.
Since the von Karman plate system is of ""hyperbolic type"" with critical
nonlinearity (noncompact with respect to the phase space), this latter topic is
particularly challenging in the case of geometrically constrained and nonlinear
damping. In this paper we first show the existence of a compact global
attractor for finite-energy solutions, and we then prove that the attractor is
both smooth and finite dimensional. Thus, the hyperbolic-like flow is
stabilized asymptotically to a smooth and finite dimensional set.

all symmetries required to match it onto non-MHV amplitudes in maximally
supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. However, to define it quantum mechanically,
one is forced to regularize it since perturbative loop diagrams are not
well-defined due to presence of ultraviolet divergences stemming from
integration in the vicinity of the cusps. A regularization that is adopted by
practitioners by allowing one to use spinor helicity formalism, on the one
hand, and systematically go to higher orders of perturbation theory is based on
a version of dimensional regularization, known as Four-Dimensional Helicity
scheme. Recently it was demonstrated that its use for the super Wilson loop at
one loop breaks both conformal symmetry and Poincare supersymmetry. Presently,
we exhibit the origin for these effects and demonstrate how one can undo this
breaking. The phenomenon is alike the one emerging in renormalization group
mixing of conformal operators in conformal theories when one uses dimensional
regularization. The rotation matrix to the diagonal basis is found by means of
computing the anomaly in the Ward identity for the conformal boost. Presently,
we apply this ideology to the super Wilson loop. We compute the one-loop
conformal anomaly for the super Wilson loop and find that the anomaly depends
on its Grassmann coordinates. By subtracting this anomalous contribution from
the super Wilson loop we restore its interpretation as a dual description for
reduced non-MHV amplitudes which are expressed in terms of superconformal
invariants.

Swift GRBs lying at 5.0<z<9.5. Our data includes very deep observations of the
field of the most distant spectroscopically confirmed burst, GRB 090423, at
z=8.2. Using the precise positions afforded by their afterglows we can place
stringent limits on the luminosities of their host galaxies. In one case, that
of GRB 060522 at z=5.11, there is a marginal excess of flux close to the GRB
position which may be a detection of a host at a magnitude J(AB)=28.5. None of
the others are significantly detected meaning that all the hosts lie below
L\star at their respective redshifts, with star formation rates SFR<4Mo/yr in
all cases. Indeed, stacking the five fields with WFC3-IR data we conclude a
mean SFR<0.17Mo/yr per galaxy. These results support the proposition that the
bulk of star formation, and hence integrated UV luminosity, at high redshifts
arises in galaxies below the detection limits of deep-field observations.
Making the reasonable assumption that GRB rate is proportional to UV luminosity
at early times allows us to compare our limits with expectations based on
galaxy luminosity functions derived from the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) and
other deep fields. We infer that a luminosity function which is evolving
rapidly towards steeper faint-end slope (alpha) and decreasing characteristic
luminosity (L\star), as suggested by some other studies, is consistent with our
observations, whereas a non-evolving LF shape is ruled out at >90% confidence.
Although it is not yet possible to make stronger statements, in the future,
with larger samples and a fuller understanding of the conditions required for
GRB production, studies like this hold great potential for probing the nature
of star formation, the shape of the galaxy luminosity function, and the supply
of ionizing photons in the early universe.

this paper we show that a small proportion of atypical observations might have
serious adverse effects on the solutions found by the sparse clustering

much reduced number of genes. Our simulation studies show that, when there are
outliers in the data, our robust sparse K-means algorithm performs better than
other competing methods both in terms of the selection of features and also the
identified clusters. This robust sparse K-means algorithm is implemented in the

area, in the letter to Adelbold here discussed. Gerbert described a semi-sphere

observations. The procedure to identify the star nearest to the North celestial
pole is very accurate and still in use in the XII century, when ""Computatrix""

precise enough and much less time consuming, but here Gerbert was clearly
aligning a precise equatorial mount for a fixed instrument for accurate daytime
observations. Through the sighting tubes it was possible to detect equinoxes
and solstices by observing the Sun in the corresponding days. The horalogium of
Magdeburg was probably a big and fixed-mount nocturlabe, always pointing the

formulation of the horizon degrees of freedom in terms of a U(1) gauge theory
which is just a gauged fixed version of the SU(2) theory. These developments
will be surveyed here. Quantum theory based on either formulation can be used
to count the horizon micro-states associated with quantum geometry fluctuations
and from this the micro-canonical entropy can be obtained. We shall review the
computation in SU(2) formulation. Leading term in the entropy is proportional
to horizon area with a coefficient depending on the Barbero-Immirzi parameter
which is fixed by matching this result with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.
Remarkably there are corrections beyond the area term, the leading one is
logarithm of the horizon area with a definite coefficient -3/2, a result which
is more than a decade old now. How the same results are obtained in the
equivalent U(1) framework will also be indicated. Over years, this entropy
formula has also been arrived at from a variety of other perspectives. In
particular, entropy of BTZ black holes in three dimensional gravity exhibits
the same logarithmic correction. Even in the String Theory, many black hole
models are known to possess such properties. This suggests a possible universal
nature of this logarithmic correction.

that it is not able to describe all the properties of nearby galaxies that can
be observed in great detail as well as that it has some problems in the
mechanism by which matter is more rapidly gathered into large-scale structure
such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies. In this work we revisit an
alternative model, the scalar field dark matter (SFDM) model, which proposes
that the galactic haloes form by condensation of a scalar field (SF) very early
in the Universe, i.e., in this model the haloes of galaxies are astronomical
Bose-Einstein Condensate drops of SF. On the other hand, large-scale structures
like clusters or superclusters of galaxies form similar to the $\Lambda$CDM
model, by hierarchy, thus all the predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM model at
cosmological scales are reproduced by SFDM. This model predicts that all galaxy
haloes must be very similar and exist for higher redshifts than in the
$\Lambda$CDM model. In the first part of this review we revisit the
cosmological evolution of SFDM model with a scalar potential
$m^2\Phi^2/2+\lambda\Phi^4/4$ with two different frameworks: the field and
fluid approach. The scalar fluctuations have an oscillating growing mode and
therefore, this kind of dark matter could lead to the early formation of
gravitational structures in the Universe. In the last part, we study the core
central density profiles of BEC dark matter haloes and fit high-resolution
rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies. The mean value of the
logarithmic inner density slopes is $\alpha = - $0.27 $\pm$ 0.18 and we show
that the recent observation of the constant dark matter central surface density
can be reproduced. We conclude that in light of the difficulties that the
$\Lambda$CDM model is currently facing the SFDM model can be a worthy
alternative to keep exploring further.

measure of the magnitude of angular momentum. It was found that the angular
momentum vectors of dark matter haloes at high redshift have a weak tendency to
be orthogonal to filaments and high mass haloes have a stronger orthogonal
alignment than low mass haloes. Since z=1, the spins of low mass haloes have
become weakly aligned parallel to filaments, whereas high mass haloes kept
their orthogonal alignment. This recent parallel alignment of low mass haloes
casts doubt on tidal torque theory as the sole mechanism for the build up of
angular momentum. We see evidence for bulk flows and the broadening of
filaments over time in the alignments of halo spin and velocities. We find a
significant alignment of the spin of neighboring dark matter haloes only at
very small separations, $r<0.3$Mpc/h, which is driven by substructure. A
correlation of the spin parameter with halo mass is confirmed at high redshift.

contemporary methods in chiral effective field theory, both the quark-mass and
finite-volume dependence of the isovector nucleon magnetic moment are carefully
examined. The extrapolation to the physical point yields a result that is
compatible with experiment, albeit with a combined statistical and systematic
uncertainty of 10%. The extrapolation shows a strong finite-volume dependence;
lattice sizes of L > 5 fm must be used to simulate results within 2% of the
infinite-volume result for the magnetic moment at the physical pion mass.

channels where signals are corrupted by the effects of both noise and delay,
and showed that, surprisingly, in some cases both are not enough to prevent
such channels from achieving unbounded capacity. Inspired by their work, we
consider channels that model continuous time communication with adversarial
delay errors. The sender is allowed to subdivide time into an arbitrarily large
number $M$ of micro-units in which binary symbols may be sent, but the symbols
are subject to unpredictable delays and may interfere with each other. We model
interference by having symbols that land in the same micro-unit of time be
summed, and we study $k$-interference channels, which allow receivers to
distinguish sums up to the value $k$. We consider both a channel adversary that
has a limit on the maximum number of steps it can delay each symbol, and a more
powerful adversary that only has a bound on the average delay.
  We give precise characterizations of the threshold between finite and
infinite capacity depending on the interference behavior and on the type of
channel adversary: for max-bounded delay, the threshold is at
$D_{\text{max}}=\ThetaM \log\min{k, M}))$, and for average bounded delay the
threshold is at $D_{\text{avg}} = \Theta(\sqrt{M \cdot \min\{k, M\}})$.

more subtle persistence properties of the full RG flow). We then apply
numerically this fixed cell-size procedure to two types of renormalizable
fractal lattices (i) the Sierpinski gasket of fractal dimension $D=\ln 3/\ln
2$, where there is no underlying classical ferromagnetic transition, so that
the RG flow in the ordered phase is similar to what happens in $d=1$ (ii) a
hierarchical diamond lattice of fractal dimension $D=4/3$, where there is an
underlying classical ferromagnetic transition, so that the RG flow in the
ordered phase is similar to what happens on hypercubic lattices of dimension
$d>1$. In both cases, we find that the transition is governed by an Infinite
Disorder Fixed Point : besides the measure of the activated exponent $\psi$, we
analyze the RG flow of various observables in the disordered and ordered
phases, in order to extract the 'typical' correlation length exponents of these
two phases which are different from the finite-size correlation length
exponent.

approximate maximum likelihood methods, and we apply these methods to estimate
the parameters for the spot prices in the Nordic electricity market. The

characterized by scaling exponents that are significantly different from the

insulator. The charge ordering is accompanied by the breathing distortion of
the BiO6 octahedra (extension and contraction of the Bi-O bond lengths).
Standard Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations fail to obtain the
crystal structure instability caused by the pure breathing distortions.
Combining effects of the breathing distortions and tilting of the BiO6
octahedra allows DFT to reproduce qualitatively experimentally observed
insulator with monoclinic crystal structure but gives strongly underestimate
breathing distortion parameter and energy gap values. In the present work we
reexamine the BaBiO3 problem within the GGA+U method using a Wannier functions
basis set for the Bi 6s-band. Due to high oxidation state of bismuth in this
material the Bi 6s-symmetry Wannier function is predominantly extended
spatially on surrounding oxygen ions and hence differs strongly from a pure
atomic 6s-orbital. That is in sharp contrast to transition metal oxides (with
exclusion of high oxidation state compounds) where the major part a of d-band
Wannier function is concentrated on metal ion and a pure atomic d-orbital can
serve as a good approximation. The GGA+U calculation results agree well with
experimental data, in particular with experimental crystal structure parameters
and energy gap values. Moreover, the GGA+U method allows one to reproduce the
crystal structure instability due to the pure breathing distortions without
octahedra tilting.

arbitrary fillings. Results are in good agreement with imaginary frequency data
from continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo calculations for the single impurity
Anderson model and the two-orbital Hubbard model within dynamical mean field
theory (DMFT) as well as real frequency data for self energy of the single band
Hubbard model within DMFT using numerical renormalization group. The method
should be applicable to a wide range of quantum impurity models and
particularly useful when high-precision real frequency results are sought.

a background of zero point vacuum fluctuations. This balance is, on average
over the orbit, a necessary condition for stationarity of the movement, and
imposes a relation on the pair $R_{0}$ (orbital radius), $\omega_{0}$ (orbital
angular velocity). That relation is simply what we have for long known as
angular momentum quantization. Taking into account the stochastic nature of the
ZPF, we have to realize that nothing, however, has been said yet on how could
this balance be attained on a quasi instantaneous basis, in other words, how
could the orbit accommodate the instantaneous excess or defect of energy so as
to keep constant the (at least average) values of its parameters ($R_{0}$,
$\omega_{0}$). Using classical electromagnetism, we explore some high order
interactions between realistic particles, exposing a mechanism (a feedback loop
between variables) that makes that stability possible. Puthoff's work led
necessarily to the quantization of angular momentum: ""if stable orbits exist...
then their angular momentum must be quantized""; now, too, we are able to do a
much stronger statement: ""the equations of the system, in the presence of ZPF

dynamical symmetry breaking of an unbiased semiconductor superlattice.
Therefore our scheme allows for the generation of DC voltages that would
otherwise be unreachable due to domain instabilities. Furthermore, for
realistic, highly doped wide miniband superlattices at room temperature the

superior to their long-cadence counterparts. The inevitable results of a faster
sampling rate are present: the short-cadence data provide greater time
resolution for short-lived events like flares, and have a much higher Nyquist
frequency than the long-cadence data; however, they also contain fewer
high-amplitude peaks at low frequency and allow a more precise determination of
pulsation frequencies, amplitudes and phases. The latter observation indicates
that Kepler data are not normally distributed. Moreover, a close inspection of
the Pre-search Data Conditioned (PDC) long-cadence data show residuals that
have increased noise on time-scales important to asteroseismology, but
unimportant to planet searches.

calls (SPam in Internet Telephony) in an outbound scenario with provable
optimal performance. In so doing, our work is largely different from related
previous work: our goal is to rigorously formalize the problem in terms of
mathematical decision theory, find the optimal solution to the problem, and
derive concrete bounds for its expected loss (number of mistakes the SPIT
filter will make in the worst case).
  This goal is achieved by considering an abstracted scenario amenable to
theoretical analysis, namely SPIT detection in an outbound scenario with pure
sources. Our methodology is to first define the cost of making an error (false
positive and false negative), apply Wald's sequential probability ratio test to
the individual sources, and then determine analytically error probabilities
such that the resulting expected loss is minimized.
  The benefits of our approach are: (1) the method is optimal (in a sense
defined in the paper); (2) the method does not rely on manual tuning and
tweaking of parameters but is completely self-contained and mathematically
justified; (3) the method is computationally simple and scalable. These are
desirable features that would make our method a component of choice in larger,

toward the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase. The theoretical AGB
nucleosynthesis models have been presented in Paper I. Several CEMP-s stars
show an enhancement in both s and r-process elements (CEMP-s/r). In order to

molecular cloud from which CEMP-s formed was previously enriched in r-elements
by Supernovae pollution.
  A general discussion and the method adopted in order to interpret the

detailed study of spectroscopic observations of individual stars. We consider
all elements from carbon to bismuth, with particular attention to the three
s-process peaks, ls (Y, Zr), hs (La, Nd, Sm) and Pb, and their ratios [hs/ls]
and [Pb/hs]. The presence of an initial r-process contribution may be typically
evaluated by the [La/Eu] ratio. We found possible agreements between
theoretical predictions and spectroscopic data. In general, the observed
[Na/Fe] (and [Mg/Fe]) provide information on the AGB initial mass, while
[hs/ls] and [Pb/hs] are mainly indicators of the s-process efficiency. A range
of 13C-pocket strengths is required to interpret the observations. However,
major discrepancies between models and observations exist. We highlight star by
star the agreements and the main problems encountered and, when possible, we
suggest potential indications for further studies. These discrepancies provide

The remainders in the symbolic calculus are bounded operators on $L^2$, whose
norm is measured with respect to some small parameter. Our main improvement
with respect to an earlier work by Williams consists in showing a
regularization effect for the remainders. Due to a nonstandard decay in the
frequency variables, the regularization takes place in a scale of anisotropic,
and singular, Sobolev spaces. Our analysis allows to extend previous results on
the existence of highly oscillatory solutions to nonlinear hyperbolic problems.
The results are also used in a companion work to justify nonlinear geometric
optics with boundary amplification, which corresponds to a more singular regime
than any other one considered before. The analysis is carried out with either

simulations is presented here. Two main issues are identified in designing
adaptive techniques for PIC simulation: first, the choice of the size of the
particle shape function in progressively refined grids, with the need to avoid
the exertion of self-forces on particles, and, second, the necessity to comply
with the strict stability constraints of the explicit PIC algorithm. The
adaptive implementation presented responds to these demands with the
introduction of a Multi Level Multi Domain (MLMD) system (where a cloud of
self-similar domains is fully simulated with both fields and particles) and the
use of an Implicit Moment PIC method as baseline algorithm for the adaptive
evolution. Information is exchanged between the levels with the projection of
the field information from the refined to the coarser levels and the
interpolation of the boundary conditions for the refined levels from the
coarser level fields. Particles are bound to their level of origin and are

all dimensions, both visible and extra have an equal sharing of the curvature

view and we combined it with ground-based NIR and visible photometry of the
stars in the field. The results were processed using the Bayesian photometric

a single-electron spectrum associated with the natural orbitals was defined as
the derivative of the total energy with respect to the occupation numbers at
half filling for the orbital of interest. This idea reproduces the bands of
various periodic systems using the appropriate functional quite accurately. In
the present work we apply this approximation to the calculation of the
ionization potentials and electron affinities of molecular systems using
various functionals within the reduced density-matrix functional theory. We
demonstrate that this approximation is very successful in general and in
particular for certain functionals it performs better than the direct
determination of the ionization potentials and electron affinities through the
calculation of positive and negative ions respectively. The reason for this is
identified to be the inaccuracy that arises from different handling of the
open- and closed-shell systems.

The calculation

Up to now, the astrophysical community has greatly benefited from the work of
the contributions of Los Alamos [1], Livermore [2] and the Opacity Project (OP)
[3]. However unexplained differences of up to 50% in the radiative forces and
Rosseland mean values for Fe have been noticed for conditions corresponding to

identification of the mode frequencies. Temperature and density conditions
equivalent to those found in stars can now be produced in laboratory
experiments for various atomic species. Recently the photo-absorption spectra
of nickel and iron plasmas have been measured during the LULI 2010 campaign,

This facility provides several monoenergetic beams (2.5, 8, 10, 12 and 14 MeV)

the measured pulse height spectra were unfolded with the code MAXED and the
resulting energy distributions were compared with those obtained from TOF. The

snow line around its parent star. We also find a correlation between the
abundances (relative to Mg and bulk Earth) and the condensation temperature;
refractory species are clearly depleted while the more volatile elements are
possibly enhanced. This could be the signature of a body that formed in a lower
temperature environment than where Earth formed. Alternatively, we could be

as compared to floating point precision. By design, a natural modification that
saves resources would be reducing synaptic weight resolution. In this study, we
give an estimate for the impact of synaptic weight discretization on different
levels, ranging from random walks of individual weights to computer simulations
of spiking neural networks. The FACETS wafer-scale hardware system offers a
4-bit resolution of synaptic weights, which is shown to be sufficient within
the scope of our network benchmark. Our findings indicate that increasing the
resolution may not even be useful in light of further restrictions of
customized mixed-signal synapses. In addition, variations due to production
imperfections are investigated and shown to be uncritical in the context of the
presented study. Our results represent a general framework for setting up and
configuring hardware-constrained synapses. We suggest how weight discretization
could be considered for other backends dedicated to large-scale simulations.
Thus, our proposition of a good hardware verification practice may rise synergy

interpolates between the 1/2 BPS line and the antiparallel lines, and can be
thought of as calculating a generalization of the quark--antiquark potential
for the gauge theory on S^3 x R. We evaluate the first two orders of these
loops perturbatively both in the gauge and string theory. We obtain analytical
expressions in a systematic expansion around the 1/2 BPS configuration, and
comment on possible all-loop patterns for these Wilson loops.

complex fluids, we study the onset of shear banding in the three most common
time-dependent experimental protocols: step stress, step strain and shear
startup. By means of a linear stability analysis we derive a fluid-universal
criterion for the onset of banding, separately for each protocol, that depends
only on the shape of the experimentally measured time-dependent rheological
response function, independent of the constitutive law and internal state
variables of the particular fluid in question. Our predictions thus have the
same status, in these time-dependent flows, as the widely known criterion for
banding in steady state (of negatively sloping shear stress vs. shear rate). We
support them with simulations of the rolie-poly model of polymeric fluids, the
soft glassy rheology model, and a fluidity model.

The HCAL is about 5 interaction
length thick, and ECAL is about 1 interaction length thick. For example, an
eighty GeV hadron, it is only 95% energy will be contained in ECAL plus HCAL.
We need a topological reconstruction of the leakage. This has been studied with
experimental data collected using the CALICE prototypes, during the 2007 test
beam campaign at CERN. The complete setup of the experiment consisted of a
silicon-tungsten electromagnetic calorimeter, an analog scintillator-steel
hadron calorimeter and a scintillator-steel tail catcher. Events collected
using pion beams in the energy range 8-100 GeV are selected and compared to the
Monte Carlo simulations. While the leakage from the full setup is negligible,
when removing the tail catcher information either partly or completely the
energy loss becomes significant and affects the performance. The average
measured energy decreases below the expected beam energy and the resolution
deteriorates. A correction to the leakage was implemented for pions. The
results obtained show that the correction is powerful in restoring the mean
value of the measured energy distributions back to the expected beam energy,
with an accuracy at the 1-2% level over the whole energy range. The relative
improvement on the resolution is about 25% at 80 GeV, decreasing at lower
energies together with the impact of the leakage.

the Heusler compound Co2FeSi has been published. Density functional theory
based calculations suggest a non half-metallic ground state. It has been
argued, that on-site Coulomb interaction of the d electrons has to be taken
into account via the LDA+U method, which predicts a half-metallic ground-state
for U = 2.5...4.5 eV. X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) can be used as a
tool to assess the appropriateness of the LDA+U approach: the calculated
spectra within the LDA+U or GGA+U schemes are different from those within the
LDA or GGA. Due to its ability to separate different orbital symmetries, XMLD
allows us to distinguish between different models of the electronic structure
of Co2FeSi. In this article we discuss experimental XMLD spectra and compare
them with detailed first principles calculations. Our findings give evidence
for the inadequacy of the LDA+U or GGA+U band structures, whereas constrained
calculations with the GGA and a fixed spin moment of 6 \mu_B give better
overall agreement between experiment and theory.

better statistical studies of triggered star formation. Also outlined is the
creation of a 'heat map' of star-formation activity in the Galactic plane. This
